0,TheLittleSongbird,A very ambitious effort from Darren Aronofsky but also an uneven one,5,31 July 2014,"Judging from the hate Noah has gotten on here I was expecting very little. Actually Noah was nowhere near as bad as heard, and while very flawed and by far the worst film of Darren Aronofsky(with his others ranging from very good to outstanding) it did have some impressive things. On the most part the film is brilliant visually, the barren apocalyptic landscapes and later more colourful ones were really striking and the cinematography has a sweeping yet somewhat surrealistic effect. The opening and creation sequences were beautifully done with the latter quite harrowing without being too heavy-handed, and the flood scene was intense and jaw-dropping in spectacle. Noah's dreams had a real creepiness too. Clint Mansell's music score swells thrillingly and has an epic sweep, enhancing crucial scenes and not drowning stuff out. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity too. There are some good performances, the best of which coming from Russell Crowe, who plays with real steel and a powerful charisma. Jennifer Connelly is a sympathetic and touching wife and mother figure, and has a scene in the last act that really does hit home and is not over-the-top. Some have disliked Emma Watson's performance but for me she brought genuine heart to a role that was more of a plot-device up until the last act, at that point she becomes the character you relate to the most. Anthony Hopkins does not have much to do but he is gleefully enjoyable in his role of Methusalah.Noah did personally fall very short though, and actually the little relation to the Bible no matter how people carp on about it is the least of its problems. Douglas Booth is rather bland and too pretty-boy-model-like while Logan Lerman came across as wooden and forced, Ham could easily have been the character we related to but for that to happen I think the film could have expanded much more on his character arc and situation. Ray Winstone is the most disappointing, he's done some great performances but this is not one of them, he is saddled with a very clichéd villain role that has no development to him and he overdoes it in a way that feels straight out of another film entirely. The characters generally are underdeveloped, especially the villain and Ham's subplot had potential to be expanded much more but Ila's character has a lot of heart and effort is made to humanise Noah although some of his decision making comes across as rather sudden. The special effects are a mixed bag, the flood effects are outstanding and the built-to-scale ark also looks incredible, both of which with much grandeur. But the Rock Monsters(or the Watchers) have a dated look, are written in a way that feels irrelevant to the story or in a way that doesn't gel with everything else going on and slightly like Transformers clones, and some of the animals(notably the snakes) look like computerised toys that don't blend within the scenery very well. The dialogue does often feel stilted and confused, especially in the first act, while taking an overwrought if well-intentioned turn in the last and coming across as a little heavy-handed in places. The story does have a number of bright spots and contains some powerful messaging, but does drag a fair bit and has some stuff that felt like filler, the film easily could have been half-an-hour shorter. The story is also a bit of a weird one, and one that leaves more questions than answers, in a sense that it does feel like it doesn't quite know what it wants to be, there's some sci-fi, some action-epic and some character-driven study(which takes up the last act), all three of which with uneven results. The ending is for my liking a bit too convenient as well. Aronofsky's direction is broad and is at home with the style of the film and the spectacle but he fails to make the story properly engage(which is unusual for Aronofsky). Overall, ambitious but uneven. Noah is nowhere near as bad as a lot of the negative reviews have said and the stick it gets for not being close to the Bible is on the unfair side- in all fairness though Noah was advertised in a way that was suggestive that it was an adaptation of the biblical story when really it is the bare bones- but it does have a lot of flaws and could have been better considering how much talent was on board. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Noah
1,Leofwine_draca,"Choppy, messy, fantasy Bible adaptation",4,25 May 2016,"NOAH is a Biblical adaptation like no other. Ostensibly telling the famous tale of the guy and his ark, what this in actuality turns out to be is a bizarre, one-off fantasy about warring tribes, rock-men, and family troubles. It's an unwieldy concoction and one which can hardly be called satisfying; a disappointment given the director's track record with the likes of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and BLACK SWAN.NOAH stars Russell Crowe as the titular character. Crowe plays a guy who is stoic, worthy, and more than a little dull. Just as dull as Jennifer Connolly, who plays his wife. Logan Lerman and Douglas Booth make little impact as the kids, while Emma Watson simply can't act and is mildly embarrassing as the adopted daughter. Anthony Hopkins is in this too, playing the world's oldest man, and he seems to be doing it in an understandably tongue-in-cheek way.The producers clearly want to make this a film to appeal to secular as well as religious audiences, so the religious stuff is kept to a minimum. There's a lot of CGI animal and water stuff, none of which really impresses, but the really tiresome thing is the way the storyline has to have a human adversary, in the form of Ray Winstone on autopilot. Clearly the end-of-the-world storyline wasn't dramatic enough. I did like the way NOAH flirts with the title character's standing and his moral quandaries, and there's one incredible evolution sequence that reminds one of Aronofsky's raw talent, but other than that, this is a mess.",Noah
2,SnoopyStyle,murky morality troublesome,6,21 October 2014,"After Cain killed Abel, he finds help from the fallen angels. His descendants conquer the world and use up its resources. The descendants of the third brother Seth live in harmony with the Earth. Noah (Russell Crowe) and his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) have three sons; Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japheth. They are hounded by the Cains. They rescue a seriously injured little girl Ila. Then God shows Noah visions to direct him to build the ark. He is opposed by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) who leads his massive tribe. The fallen angels agree to help Noah. Years later, Shem and Ila (Emma Watson) have fallen in love but she is infertile. Ham is concerned that he doesn't have a mate. Noah is convinced that he is to end the existence of mankind and his family is the final family.I do like Aronofsky putting his stamp on the style of this movie. I love the visual and the fallen angels. There are great actors. They are putting all their effort into their performances. However the morality of the movie is murky and troublesome. In essence, Noah is thrown into more of a villain role as he insists on ending mankind. In the end, he defied God to not kill his grandchildren and thereby saving humanity. It is an unusual take on the story and it does not really work as a bible story. In the version that I have, it says in Genesis 6:18 ""And I do establish my covenant with you; and you must go into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you."" It feels like Aronofsky is playing around with the bible to come up with something interesting to him.",Noah
3,Hitchcoc,An Absolute Mess,2,29 May 2015,"I never had any intention of watching this but it showed up on Netflix and so I gave it a shot. What a mess of a movie. First of all we need to throw out the whole Noah fairy tale as it is presented in the Bible. If one were to take the time to look, we would see that flood/purification myths existed long before the Old Testament was even a thought in the writer's minds. It was all an evolution of thought to try to come to grips with the reason people are the way they are. This movie is about a guy who, for some reason, becomes God's darling, even though he is so full of ego as to think he knows anything. He goes from being a loving father to being tyrant and, basically, an abuser. At no time in this film are we privy to God ""talking"" to Noah. He simply decides what the plans are. I'm not talking about the animal thing, which is incredibly ludicrous. God pretty much sticks them on the Ark and then puts them in a kind of suspended animation. Russell Crowe walks around like he is constipated. He is so intent on his own version of how things will be that he turns his back on his family. Yes, he is the provider, and the times would make him unapproachable by his wife and children. He is the grandson of Methuselah (where did they pull that out of?); you know, the guy who lived 900 and some years (good old Anthony Hopkins) and apparently was some sort of conduit to God. Crowe/Noah builds the Ark, a giant box rather than the stereotypical ship with the little house on top that schoolchildren are used to. Anyway, at some point he gets it in his head that his mission is simply to save the animals and he and his family is to die off, ending the reign of man on earth. His daughter in law (sort of), Hermione Granger is impregnated after Hopkin cures her barrenness. So old Noah decides that if the baby is a daughter, he will simply end its life. He has also offended his son Ham (the patron saint of actors) by not saving a young woman he has fallen in love with. Ham spews hatred and has every right to. There is also on board, a stowaway, who is really a Satan, who is going to take over the family by killing Noah (with Ham's help). Ham, of course, to some cultists, is thought to be the reason for races that are inferior. So he is the new Cain, even though he is confused and depressed. The way this all ends is so pathetic. There are implications that are hard to imagine, but, then, it's just a silly version of an equally silly story. Oh, I didn't even mention the rock creatures that were punished by God and eventually helped Noah build the Ark. If there was even a semblance of some sort of classic point here, it ended when these guys showed up. I thought that the John Voight TV miniseries was bad, but this one takes the cake.",Noah
4,Prismark10,That sinking feeling,3,7 July 2014,"This film is not biblical re-telling of Noah but a mish mash from the texts of various Abrahamic religions and then fashioned into a screenplay for modern audiences. In fact we even get some modern science thrown into it and some scenes of the big bang and evolution.The film has a raw, bleak landscape in a world where supposedly few people existed. Society is violent and brutal and and religious laws are there to bring order into society but the descendants of Cain seem to stand for disorder.In this landscape, Noah (Russell Crowe)has visions of destruction by water and soon a forest materialises in order to supply wood for the ark and the rock people stranded on earth help Noah and his family.There are side stories as one of Noah's son having a partner who cannot bear children whilst his other son, Ham is still looking for a girl to take into the ark.The we have the descendant of Cain (Ray Winstone)who arrives wanting his followers to be in the ark but Noah has no place for anyone else especially the descendants of Cain.Darren Aronofsky has his work cut out bringing a well known biblical work to life for a modern audience, the film starts promisingly enough but descends into silliness. You kind of guess there will be a violent showdown with Russell Crowe and Ray Winstone, that one of Noah's son will aid Winstone. By the end of the film you just think Noah has lost the plot and the film is just barmy.",Noah
5,claudio_carvalho,"Noah's Ark, the Spoof by Hollywood",2,12 July 2014,"Noah's Ark is a very well known story in several religions, including the Judaism, Christianity and Islamism. God decides to destroy the world with a great flood because of the human evilness. However he spares Noah, who is a good and fair man, and asks him to build a wooden ark to save his family and one male and one female of each animal and bird. Hollywood decided to make a spoof of the Noah's Ark, using other movies as reference: ""The Neverending Story"" combined with ""Transformers"" give The Guardians; ""The Shining"" for the behavior of Noah in his Ark; ""Gladiator"" has inspired Noah's personality; in the environment of Waterworld. In addition, there are other stupid moments, like Noah trying to kill the babies; or Ham helping the intruder; or the period that they stay in the Ark. Black powder in a biblical time? I saw this movie with family and friends and we have laughed a lot. I would never expected such a mess from Darren Aronofsky. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): ""Noé"" (""Noah"")",Noah
6,nogodnomasters,NOT YOUR MOMMA'S NOAH,6,4 October 2018,"Forget what you think you know about Noah. In this Middle Earth saga the watchers are huge rock creatures that look like they belong in Star Wars. This is a rather bizarre interpretation of Genesis 6:1-5, and was my second WTF moment after that dog with scales thing. In the bible, the Watchers had relations with humans and created a race of giants who apparently ruled over man...not in this film.Russell Crowe portrays Noah as a dark, bitter, dysfunctional, unlikeable person who obeys God through his dreams. (God doesn't even make a cameo.) The women, whose names aren't mentioned in the Bible are given expanded and important roles. All the time on the ark is spent on personal drama. No tending of the animals that are all living together in the hull of the ship.Another problem is that Tubal-Cain kills Noah's father Lamech, not to be confused with Tubal-Cain's father Lamech while Noah was a child.The Bible claims Lamech was born in the 182nd year of Methuselah and lived 777 years. This means he died 10 years before the flood. Noah was over 600 years old at the time of the flood. Do the math.There were a number of surprises, some I won't mention as I wouldn't want to ""spoil"" a millennia tale. That said, at the end, a son leaves the group before them all having children when clearly the families stayed together for a number of years and raised children until the Canaan/Noah incident which is not mentioned.Poor Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly acted their hearts out, reminding me of Sean Astin who gave a wonderful performance in ""Cabin Fever 3."" Nothing like casting pearls before swine.From a biblical prospective, the film was a disaster and not inspirational. As an action adventure story, the rock creatures made me feel like I was watching Indian Jones with aliens. And I suppose people who liked the ending of that film might be attracted to this one.Oh yea, this thing was way too long. It had scenes which dragged on. It needed an editor.This is Razzy material. A film you can watch and make fun of MST style. On the plus side Russell Crowe didn't sing that much.6 star cheese rating. Not too bad for a midnight flick wink wink nudge nudge.",Noah
7,kosmasp,Dividing (not the sea),7,30 November 2014,"You probably do know the basics, so I don't consider those spoiler. Even people who are not religious, do know what Noah and his Arc stood for. Or what they were built for if you will. But there are things in here, that I didn't expect or see coming. One of them is the character of Noah himself. I can see why some people felt offended by the portrayal, but it does make sense in the end, not to mention that it makes a terrific plot line for the movie itself.Of course this might sound offensive to people who hold Noah in high regard, but Darren A. did his best, with a story/history that he clearly loves. There is drama and there is a lot of conflict, within and without the family. You get the answer how so many animals who actually should hate each other could be on the same ship though ... Visually this is also stunning. The effects are really good and the actors carry their weight.",Noah
8,classicsoncall,"""He's going to destroy the world.""",7,8 December 2018,"At least I thought the film struck a reverent tone when dealing with Noah's (Russell Crowe) beliefs, his faith, and commitment to God. But it's the film makers' imagination that takes the picture in directions that felt contrived and unimaginable. Some I liked and some I didn't. The 'Garden of Eden' seed was a capable metaphor for describing how Noah might possibly have gathered the material necessary to build the immense ark required for the salvation of the planet's animals. But the concept of The Watchers simply eluded me on every level. If I might make an apt comparison, they were like the Jar-Jar Binks of this movie, even though I personally didn't have a whole lot of problems with Jar-Jar in the 'Star Wars' franchise. The rock men called The Watchers may have been fallen angels, but they were a very large distraction for me and looked like they belonged in a kid's sci-fi movie. The acting I thought was good by the main principals, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly in particular. Emma Watson was surprisingly effective as well, as I'm a sucker for actors or actresses who can cry at the drop of a hat. Douglas Booth as Shem and Logan Lerman as Ham were by contrast basically adequate, they didn't move me in any direction one way or the other. In general I don't find much fault with movie CGI but even I was able to pick up on the stodgy quality of the CGI animals in all their iterations. The pairing of the animals is probably the best remembered facet of The Ark story in the Bible, but it gained considerably short shrift in this version, taking a back seat to the family dynamic of Noah's family and the future of mankind. One thing I'll have to admit is that I never thought about the repercussions of humanity being wiped out, only to depend on the survivors of Noah's immediate family. Given the surviving members and the way the picture ends, there's little comfort in imagining how the world repopulated itself.",Noah
9,jboothmillard,Noah,6,27 April 2014,"From director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, Black Swan), many of the famous characters from the Bible had been tackled in movies, but this was probably the first about the man with his Ark, and the animals went in two by two, so I was looking forward to it. Basically the films begins telling of Genesis, where God created the Earth, and then man and woman, and then sin was created when Adam and Eve ate fruit from the forbidden tree, and they were banished from the Garden of Eden. Moving forward in time, Lamech (Marton Csokas) is killed by Young King Tubal-Cain (Finn Wittrock), while Lamech's son Young Noah (Dakota Goyo) runs, and many years later Noah (Russell Crowe) has his own family, wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and three sons, Shem (Gavin Casalegno), Ham (Nolan Gross) and Japheth. One day Noah witnesses a flower grow instantly from the ground, and he is haunted by dreams where a great flood will happen some time soon, after visiting his grandfather Methuselah (Sir Anthony Hopkins) he confirms that while life will be destroyed during this flood new life will begin. Noah and the family make a journey to a place with good soil, on the journey they come across a group of dead people, they find a lone survivor, Young Ila (Skylar Burke), who they adopt as their own, and being chased by those who killed these people they take refuge with the Watchers, fallen angels confined to Earth as stone golems for helping Adam and Eve when they were banished from the Garden of Eden. Following this they find a place to settle, and with the seed that Methuselah gave Noah, derived from the Garden of Eden, this seed is planted and an entire forest grows within seconds, from his dreams Noah knows that he is tasked with building an Ark, where two of all animals of the world will go inside and, with the family, survive the flood. The trees of the forest, with the help of the Watchers will build Noah's Ark, as time goes by the children have grown up, as the Ark is nearing completion many various species of animal enter it, and to allow all to travel calmly are put to sleep with a sedative smoke. Ila (Emma Watson) has fallen in love with Shem (Douglas Booth), but as a child she was cut of her ability to bare children, but as a gift Methuselah cures her infertility, Noah tried to find Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll) wives, but witnessed cannibalism within a nearby settlement, Ham searches for a wife himself, and finds refugee Na'el (Madison Davenport). During an attack by Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) and his followers on the Ark, Ham is forced to save himself and leave Na'el to die, but with it being finished the family enter the Ark as the storm rushes in, besides Methuselah, and the Watchers sacrifice themselves to protect it, and in doing so they go up to Heaven, all the soldiers outside are drowned, but Tubal-Cain climbs on, and is assisted by Ham, as he is angry with his father. Noah is shocked and angered when he finds out that, when the rains have stopped, Ila is pregnant with Shem's child, because the Creator's wish was to destroy humanity and to start life anew, so to honour those wishes, against the judgement of Naameh, he says that when the child is born he will have no choice but to kill it. Months pass and the couple expecting build a raft which they will use to sail and escape, but Noah burns it after finding it, and when Ila does give birth, it is to twin girls, meanwhile Ham is almost convinced to help Tubal-Cain kill his father, during their fight the Ark hits a mountain, and Ham kills the villain. Noah goes to carry out what he believes is the will of God, to kill the twin babies, but he is turned from this decision seeing their innocence and spares them, but following this brutality in his nature he leaves the Ark to go into isolation, while on this island life is starting to begin again. In the end Noah is found by his sons, he, Naameh and the family reconcile as he he realises that the new life also comes from the human race as well, he blesses the family, while Ham departs to further lands, and all life continues to flourish for the creatures and all human kind. Also starring Nick Nolte as Samyaza, Frank Langella as Og and Mark Margolis as Magog. Crowe is charismatic as the man whose duty it was to save all animals of the world, but he also has the determined and dark moments as well, Connelly is fine as his faithful wife who tries to stand by him, Hopkins is hammy as the fortune telling oldie, and Winstone does slightly egg being the bad guy. Apparently this tale from the Bible sticks very much to the story told in the Old Testament, you may ask questions about some of the characters or small events, like the Watchers, but it does make for some interesting plot points, especially in explaining the construction of the Ark, and the special effects obviously help with the scenes of the great flood and life starting again, if you are looking for a good old fashioned adventure then this is a likable biblical drama. Good!",Noah
10,tavm,This version of the Noah story was an artistic triumph as far as I'm concerned,8,30 August 2014,"Just watched this on Netflix disc with Mom who happens to be a follower of the Bible. There are many depictions she doesn't remember reading about like those Watchers. She also didn't understand why Noah would initially consider killing his daughter-in-law's two infant girls. Me, I mainly went along for the ride and let the story and images take me. Darren Aronofsky is not a crowd pleaser like Cecil B. DeMille so I accepted whatever artistic touches he made in making this. Fine performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, Anthony Hopkins, and Ray Winstone as the nemesis. In summary, I highly recommend Noah if you're not the kind who expects a Sunday school lesson here.",Noah
11,sunwarrior13,A Refreshing Film Based On Noah's Ark,10,28 March 2014,"Noah is a Biblical-inspired film based on the story of Noah's Ark.It stars Russell Crowe as Noah along with Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone, Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins.It was written and directed by Darren Aronofsky.The story about a righteous man that he is singled out by God to save innocent life so the evil and corrupt can perish in a disastrous flood that will cover the earth.Encouraged by his grandfather Methuselah,Noah begins building an ark that will contain two of every beast and plant, as well as his family.His wife Naameh supports her husband and so does his two sons,Shem and Japheth.But his other son Ham isn't so sure due to the fact that he lacks a spouse similar unlike Shem,who has Ila. As birds, reptiles, and then mammals enter the ark, humans gather nearby, anxious for their own boarding passes. But they were tried to be stopped by an evil king Tubal-cain and his people,whose wickedness God intends stop.But once the waters rise, Noah faces new challenges.Among them is that he finds out that Ila is is pregnant and no longer barren and whether Noah wants to end humanity or not when they enter the new world.There was definitely a lot of creative license taken in re-telling the story of Noah that some Christian may find confusing or absurd.Nevertheless,the recreation of the Old Testament story is definitely an epic.Some may find the changes in the story outlandish but others may find it a great way of updating this timeless tale into the 21st century audience.We get to see how the story of Noah is told on a human scale and deeply explore the personalities involved in the story.Give credit to the cast for their great acting particularly Russell Crowe,who does a magnificent job as Noah; together with his co-stars like Jennifer Connelly,who plays his troubled wife,Naameh and Emma Watson,who plays the complex Ila.There was great visuals in the movie especially from narration of Creation and the Great Flood itself.It was definitely a great visual extravaganza.It also presents challenges especially to some audience especially what they want to do if they find themselves in place of Noah's shoes as to whether to end humanity or not.The tension in their family particularly between Noah and his sons as well as Noah and his wife,Naameh about what the Creator wanted him to do emphasizes that.Atheists may fully appreciate this film especially when the theory of evolution is somewhat put in place when the story of Creation was being narrated and God is somewhat not a main character in the movie.But for Christians who want more about the moral,philosophical and theological implications of the story of Noah based on their religious beliefs,one may find it disappointing.Nevertheless,I would consider this film entertaining and fun to watch with an open mind and isn't looking to refresh Noah's story based from what is written in the Bible.",Noah

13,Theo Robertson,Peter Jackson Meets Peter Watkins Meets James Lovelock,7,7 April 2014,"I was really looking forward to this for one reason and one reason only . The director Darren Aronofsky is just about the most interesting director working today . He doesn't always hit the bullseye but he did direct REQUIEM FOR A DREAM one of the very few films I would describe as a masterpiece and he really upset an uninformed audience who went in to BLACK SWAN thinking it was going to be a high brow film featuring ballet as its theme . Indeed the only time I've seen audience members walk out in obvious disgust was during a screening of BLACK SWAN . With a title like NOAH one wondered Aronofsky might have the same effect on Christians . This is a film that promised to be controversial and as soon as preview audiences saw it there was a very sharp divide between love and hate . Interesting that it had an average rating of 8.8 then quickly started falling as people on this site gave it bad reviews . One can't help thinking there's a campaign by religious believers who seem angry at this film because it deviates from scripture . As an anti-theist my only reservations before seeing it were that the trailers looked like it was inspired by Peter Jackson's version of Tolkien The bad news is that we've got Peter Jackson meets Peter Watkins meets Professor James Lovelock . NOAH is a heavily religious film as you might expect but not in the way you're expecting . From the outset we're told that the tribe of Cain have built "" industrial cities "" and it's this that has brought "" the wrath of the creator "" . It's not the religion of the Abrahamic cult but the cult of environmentalism and Gaia theory . The subtext is so obvious that it doesn't qualify as subtext because it's far too blatant . Noah and his family are all vegetarians who don't eat meat while the villain Tubal-Cain does because .... well he's the bad guy . Actually this is the major failing of the film . There's no one to root for because the screenplay is an absolute mess . Tubal Cain shows signs of Darwinian practicalities by eating animals in order to survive but there's no real in depth psychological analysis to the character . He wants the Ark because the story needs a villain and is so overdone you're surprised why the other characters can't see through him . . Noah isn't any better because he's an animal loving psychotic misanthrope . Can you think of any obvious society full of nature loving animal loving psychotic misanthropes ? I'll give you a clue . It was a Central European country built on Neo-Pagan ideals that used an ancient Sanskrit symbol and lasted from 1933 to 1945 . People should stop to consider who they should adopt as role models and when people treat environmentalism as a religion bad things will surely happen but we're ordered to take the side of environmentalism and not to question it In the hands of a lesser director NOAH would have sunk at the box office but thankfully we are talking about Aronofsky . And the good news he's reigned in some the excesses that made me hate THE FOUNTAIN . Yes it owes a lot to Peter Jackson but Aronofsky recognises the strengths of Jackson when he made the LOTR trilogy . We see beautiful locations that captures the bleak brutal beauty of nature throughout the film and some of the cinematography is genuinely stunning . The cast are rather uneven which is hardly surprising considering the screenplay and an audience will find their performances divisive , none more so in Crowe . Connelly is rather bland , Winstone is rather one note and is ...well Ray Winstone .love him or loathe him . By far the best performance is by ,Emma Watson as Ila who might have been a mere cypher or plot device and yet manages to flesh out her role without being showy in any way .In summary NOAH might just fall in to a"" flawed masterpiece /interesting failure "" camp . It's an extraordinarily beautiful looking film that I'll buy on DVD and one hopes it'll be up for Best Director , cinematography and score when the Oscars come around but since it's been released in the Spring the studio don't seem to have much ( Pardon the pun ) faith in it and it'll be quickly forgotten . While the visuals deliver it does have a very sententious , sombre confusing screenplay that feels the need to both shout at and talk down to the audience . Whatever the flaws of this film it still showcases the talents of Aronofsky and here's to the future and whatever it brings",Noah
14,LeonLouisRicci,The Epic of Gilgamesh meets The Book of Enoch meets The Bible,7,3 August 2014,"Folks who have Argued that this is Not True to the Source Material First have to Realize that the Original Story of the Flood that They are Talking About (in The Bible) was First Told in the the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and was Written Many Centuries Before the Old Testament and is More Detailed but Essentially the Same. This is Not the Exact Story as Told in the Bible. If it was there Wouldn't be Much More than a Few Pages of Script because in the ""Good Book"" it is Nothing More than a Very Short Essay.The Film does a lot of Things that Fit into a Mythological and Mystical Format. There are Animals that are Not Known in the Historical Record and there is Technology that Academics would Say is Ancient Impossible. So that is Kinda Cool and Makes Sense out of Stuff in the Bible that doesn't Make Sense.There are Environmental Concerns in the Movie. After All the Story is About the Destruction of the Environment. People too are to be Destroyed as in Humanicide, save for Noah's Family and of course the Critters. But Turning The Watchers (Nephilim/Fallen Angels), from The Book of Enoch, into Silly Rock Giants was the Film's Most Glaring Silliness.Overall, it is a Worth a View, but Fundamentalists be Prepared to Get Your Anger On. Secularists, Agnostics, and Atheists can Enjoy it as a Fantasy Film. But it is a Mystery why an Artsy Director Like Darren Aronofsky chose to Make Everything Look so Dull and Depressing. The Movie does State that it is a New Beginning and Hope is the Buzz, but the Director Manages to Make this Film look like Dozens of Others with Washed Out Color and it just Looks Boring and Sepia-Toned Most of the Time.",Noah
15,zardoz-13,Raindrops Kept Falling On His Head!,7,8 April 2014,"Visionary filmmaker Darren Aronofsky is an acquired taste. The Brooklyn-born, Harvard University graduate makes esoteric films with a film festival-oriented sensibility, and he dabbles in subject matter and story-lines that may strike some audiences as provocative but offensive. Most of the time, Aronofsky helms R-rated movies that are far from being family friendly. ""Black Swan"" (2010), ""The Wrestler"" (2008), ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000) and ""Pi"" (1998) carried R-ratings, while the MPAA gave ""The Fountain"" a PG-13 rating. Despite his debatable subject matter and story lines, Aronofsky takes his movie-making efforts pretty seriously. Indeed, Aronofsky lives up to his provocative but offensive reputation with his sixth feature-length film. ""Noah"" should not be mistaken for a conventional Christian movie. Writer & director Aronofsky and co-scenarist Ari Handel draw not only on the Biblical Book of Genesis: Chapters 6-9, but also the apocryphal Jewish Book of Enoch. Aronofsky has described ""Noah"" as ""the least biblical film ever made."" This ambitious but uneven 138-minute Old Testament tale bristles with surprises that drastically differentiate it from most theatrical Christian films. According to Aronofsky, he wanted to explore the Great Flood as ""an environmental apocalypse,"" and he classifies Noah as ""the first environmentalist."". Superficially, the ""Black Swan"" filmmaker's adaptation adheres to the broad, general outlines of the Biblical saga of Noah and the Great Flood. This Paramount Pictures release, however, constitutes the first Biblical blockbuster to incorporate supernatural elements which have been confined traditionally to either science fiction or fantasy films. The supernatural elements in part come from the Book of Enoch, principally the fallen angels referred to as 'the Watchers.' Noah"" opens with the title hero as a child. Noah's father Lamech (Marton Csokas of ""Kingdom of Heaven"") unravels a sacred snake-skin and tells Noah about it when Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone of ""The Departed"") and henchmen interrupt them. No sooner has Tubal-cain shown up than he murders Lemech without a qualm. He smashes Lamech in the skull with a hammer. Decades afterward, Noah (Oscar-winner Russell Crowe of ""Gladiator"") has grown up. He has a wife, Naameh (Jennifer Connelly of ""Blood Diamond""), and three children, Shem, Ham and Japheth. Noah and Naameh have kept themselves busy raising their three sons. They behave like hermits and shun city-living. Since the Fall of Adam, the Earth has degenerated into a desolate, inhospitable Hell on Earth. Indeed, ""Noah"" resembles ""Mad Max"" because everything looks sun-sorched and everybody dresses as if they were in a leather-clad, medieval movie. At one point, Methuselah appears in full body armor with an extraordinary sword. As vast armies of men charge headlong toward him, Methuselah hoists his sword and then plunges it in the ground. Miraculously, when he shoves the sword into the Earth, the effect is comparable a modern-day fighter jet dumping napalm, and Methuselah incinerates the entire army! Much later, Noah has a dream. He finds himself underwater with thousands of corpses. When he awakens, he has his marching orders. He visits Methuselah, now an ancient man in a remote cave atop a huge mountain and explains that the Creator will destroy the world with water instead of fire. Along the way, Noah and company come across some brutal but sad looking hulks of giants referred to as Watchers. The Book of Enoch contains references to these Watchers. In this instance, the Watchers are fallen angels. Eventually, Noah recruits the Watchers to help him construct the Ark. Once the villainous Tubal-cain learns about Noah's plans, he shows up with his army to take advantage of this golden opportunity. Tubal-cain demands that Noah assure him passage aboard the ship, but our hero defies him. When Tubal-cain makes threats, the Watchers line up ominously behind Noah to defend him. Meantime, Noah and Naameh have taken in a poor girl left-for-dead, Ila (Emma Watson of the ""Harry Potter"" movies), and she becomes Shem's playmate. Family tensions arise between Ham (Logan Lerman of the ""Percy Jackson"" movies) and Noah, when Ham is not allowed to take a girl for himself from Tubal-cain's kingdom.As historical Biblical films go, ""Noah"" is nothing like the earlier release ""Son of God."" Moreover, little in ""Noah"" resembles the 1966 epic ""The Bible: In The Beginning"" that cast John Huston as Noah, with an ark that looked more like a ship more than a wooden cargo container cargo. Russell Crowe's darkly-clad Noah qualifies as much as an action hero as a patriarchal figure who shuns meat as a part of his diet. He can wield a knife with the best of them, and he acquits himself admirably in close-quarters combat when he clears the deck of the ark of intruders before the rain launches the vessel. In fact, Noah is terribly obsessed with what he must do for his 'Creator.' Initially, he believes that he must preserve the wildlife for a new world even though he believes that his own family must perish! For the record, nobody utters the name 'God' anywhere in ""Noah,"" and this crucial omission may be more than traditional Christians may tolerate. In the novelization of the film, the word Creator is substituted for the name God, too. Indeed, Aronofsky takes full advantage of poetic license in his interesting but awkward re-imagination of the Great Flood. Throughout ""Noah,"" the principals entwine the snake skin that the serpent shed when it slithered into Eden, and this birthright is deployed for its magical properties. The character of Methuselah provides Noah with a seed from the Garden of Eden that enables him to build the Ark. Aronofsky changes several things, eliminates certain characters from Noah's family, and allows a treacherous stowaway to slip aboard the Ark. Ultimately, the supernatural creatures that will spoil it for Bible purists. Secular audiences may enjoy ""Noah"" more than their spiritual counterparts for Aronofsky's radical departure from the story and the new design of the Ark.",Noah
16,grantss,Big budget makes for incredibly bad movie,1,14 April 2015,"Evidence that the bigger the budget, the worse the movie. Spectacularly bad. This is an incredibly stupid movie magnified by its expensive production, making it even worse.Why Darren Aronofsky decided to make this movie, I don't know. He has made some of the most original dramas of the last 20 years: Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler and Black Swan. Requiem for a a Dream and The Wrestler rank among the best movies ever made (they're certainly in my top 100). And then he decides to make this crap.Maybe it was suddenly having a massive budget at his disposal, and not being accustomed to all that freedom in how to spend it...So much wrong with this movie, so where to start? First, this is not the Biblical Noah, even though it purports to be. Almost all the backstory and background is pure Hollywood fabrication. The background is really just an excuse to introduce monsters and battles between armies. It's like Marvel Comics rewriting the Bible...Aronofsky should have written the story from scratch, and not try to leverage off a Bible story.However, even as a standalone, non-Biblical, story, the movie fails. It is just ridiculously silly and feels so much like every other Marvel movie or sword and sorcery movie.Just about every sub-plot, twist and piece of dialogue is eye-roll inducing.All-star cast, but I doubt any of them will be proud to have this on their CVs.",Noah
17,oscaralbert,In the Beginning was The Word . . .,8,1 April 2014,". . . and The Word was fleshed out by the makers of NOAH. They say one picture is worth a thousand words, and the Bible would be way too heavy for anyone to lift IF they had included all the pages needed to explain the Science of Early Man, and how The Watchers (or Fallen Angels) helped Noah build his Ark. Since there was double the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere for Man's first 10 generations compared to smoggy today, and since Seth's descendants--including Noah--were vegetarians, they all enjoyed healthy, active lives well into their 500s and 600s. Noah's granddad lived more than 9 centuries, until drowning in The Flood. NOAH had A BEAUTIFUL MIND, and the brains of Cain's meat-eating progeny were even sharper. The latter invented body armor, metal swords, leg-hold traps, and small nuclear weapons many thousands of years ago. (One of them was a stowaway on the Ark itself, and is shown here munching on unicorn, centaur, and sphinx meat.) When Noah got depressed after The Flood, Hermione cheered him up by providing a set of twin granddaughters with which his sons eventually could procreate, thus saving humanity (as she helped Harry Potter save wizardry). Of course, since human genes were flawless back then, there was no need for any incest taboos, leaving everyone to live happily ever after as one big family. That pretty much sums up NOAH, but additional details are available from the faculty of Liberty University.",Noah
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Get your feet wet,7,5 April 2014,"Get your feet wet Upon a terrifying nightmare that is clearly an omen, Noah(a roaring and fanatically determined Crowe), along with his family, begin building an ark. They get some unexpected help, but will it be enough? Especially when the king of the land(Winstone at his most vile, representing the wickedness of our species) shows up with his army, threatening that if that boat is the only safe place, they will board it one way or another.Causing controversy from before anyone had watched it, this is a non-literal update-for-our-times take on the Bible story, that nevertheless seeks to engage with the same, genuinely universal, values – honestly, everything added here is not only critical to even make it a feature length drama(such as adding a present, physical form to the evil that is being drowned out, as it were), it serves to flesh out what was already there. This is aggressively environmental, thus rendering it highly relevant; the Earth(which could be 1000 years in the past, or the future) is here a barren, post-apocalyptic wasteland, and while it could have been made clearer, the idea is that excessive and relentless mining of resources is the cause. Not only are we beyond rescuing, the storm that will come will deliver water sorely needed to reinvigorate nature.This has everything we've come to expect from Aronofsky: solid production values in every aspect, with a solid, and nicely limited(so that there is room for them all to represent some element endemic to us Homo Sapiens, and this is very much a character study of our titular protagonist, and an examination of humanity) cast, a compelling Clint Mansell score, and, of course, amazing(and all with a distinct purpose, artistically) visuals(the desperation of a dying breed is one of the images that will stick with you, something that is in everything Darren has helmed), employing techniques not often seen in the mainstream, including silhouette(such as a brief and stunning extrapolation of Cain) and time-lapse photography(the construction process itself). If you at all intend to watch this, and your first viewing is not a 3D showing, you will be committing a cardinal sin.There is a lot of brutal, gory, violent and disturbing content and some sexuality in this, none of it gratuitous. I recommend this to anyone not put off by it being based on a Genesis account or the fact that it takes liberties with it. 7/10",Noah

20,neil-476,This is the most enjoyable Aronofsky film yet (that is NOT a recommendation),7,11 April 2014,"With the help of his sons Shem, Japheth and Percy Jackson, and a bunch of exploding rock-men angels, glum grumpy Noah builds an enormous boat on which to stash his wife, sons, Hermione from Harry Potter, and two each of all the animals (which conveniently lapse into comas as soon as they are on board). This does not go down well with his neighbours, albeit it goes down better than the drainage problems which come about shortly afterwards. And it turns out there are stowaways on board.This is the 5th Darren Aronofsky film I have seen. Of the previous 4, I thought one was pretentious drivel and I didn't enjoy it at all (Fountain), and I thought 3 were very good and I didn't enjoy them at all (Requiem, Wrestler, Swan). Aronofsky viewing has not been a happy experience for me, but I liked the look of the trailer for Noah.The good news is that I enjoyed it more than I have enjoyed any other Aronofsky movie. Having said that, it is a bit of a weird one. It contains the expected Biblical epic stuff (although all the birds that flieth and beasts that creepeth rather conveniently start snoozing once they are on board, thus obviating the need for truckloads of CGI. Which is fair enough because there are truckloads of CGI elsewhere, including the aforementioned rocky angels).It also contains Crowe as a depressed, depressing Noah (a good performance, but not an attractive one), Ray Winstone as a scenery-chewing baddie with a weird beard, a dodgy accent and a penchant for gnawing on raw beasts that snoozeth, Percy Jackson, a couple of forgettables as Shem and Japheth, and first rate performances from Jennifer Connelly as Mrs Noah and, especially, Emma Watson as Mrs Shem.I quite enjoyed this for what it was, but it was downright peculiar - the bits added into the accepted Noah stuff are not at all what one would expect, and I'm far from sure what Aronofsky was driving at.I did think Percy Jackson could have made a bigger contribution towards dealing with the water problems. He can do it, you know, I've seen him do it in his own films.",Noah
21,evanston_dad,Hot Mess Will Have Bible Purists Tearing Their Hair Out,6,31 May 2015,"Ordinarily, you could not get me within 20 feet of a Biblical epic, but I just had to see what Darren Aronofsky would do with one of the most famous and revered of all Biblical stories.What he does with it is make a hot mess that spends most of its running time teetering on the brink between original and stupid, tipping finally into the latter category. But hey, kudos to the guy for trying to do something other than make one more stodgy, literal and dull adaptation of a story that's been told to death.Aronfosky takes the story of Noah as a jumping off point and makes a fantasy film out of it, complete with giant rock monsters and battle scenes that look lifted directly out of ""Lord of the Rings."" Bible purists will no doubt be horrified with what he does to Noah's story, but I thought this approach was refreshing. Because let's face it -- the lessons contained within the Bible may be valid, but the stories themselves are pure fantasy, our culture's version of Greek mythology. But Aronofsky lets his imagination run a little too wild, introducing a villain stowaway story that becomes tedious very quickly. What he does with Noah himself is interesting to a point -- in his piousness and devotion to God, Noah becomes a villain in his own right, taking his interpretation of God's commands to extremes without considering any alternatives, clearly a comment on religious zealotry and the lengths to which people will go to justify horrible actions and thoughts by saying that they're following God's design. This message in the movie is somewhat diluted by the fact that one of the characters at the end summarizes it for the audience, something I didn't need the movie to do because the point had already been made clearly. Ultimately, the silliness and messiness of ""Noah"" outweighs its merits, but it's not a total loss of a movie, and Aronofsky has successfully kept me interested in seeing what he does next.Grade: B-",Noah
22,Uriah43,Wasn't Nearly as Good as the Original Story,4,24 August 2016,"Prior to watching this movie I figured that there would be some discrepancies with the story compared to the Biblical outline. Needless to say, I was proved right as the film mixed in parts of the Book of Enoch along with the Genesis account and then turned it over to the imagination of the writers to take it from there. Throw in some good actors, uneven special effects along with plenty of action and the end result was nothing resembling the Biblical narrative. But the shame of it all is that this movie would have probably been much better had the writers not strayed too far from the ancient script because it became quite apparent that these modern, highly-educated writers weren't nearly as capable as their predecessors over 6000 years ago. Think about it-they had all of the resources of the modern world at their disposal and the end result wasn't nearly as good as the original story written thousands of years earlier. But then that's Hollywood I suppose. Be that as it may, if a person can disassociate the movie from the original Genesis account then it's possible that there may be some redemptive entertainment value to be gathered from it all. Both Russell Crowe (as ""Noah"") and Jennifer Connelly (""Naameh"") put in fine performances and the special effects involving the flood was also pretty good. Unfortunately, the special effects pertaining to ""the Watchers"" needed significant improvement and certainly didn't help this picture in any way. In short, although it wasn't a terribly bad film, I believe this movie could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",Noah
23,ferguson-6,Man Broke This,6,30 March 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Since I am no biblical scholar, my comments are those of a movie lover. Tackling any part of a story from the bible is a journey filled with land mines and aggressive criticism - and that's before your movie is released! Surely director Darren Aronofsky was prepared for backlash from those who forbid any interpretation of the Good Book. The story of Noah lasts but a few pages in the bible, meaning Aronofsky had to creatively fill some space to produce a 2-plus hour film.Russell Crowe makes a fine Noah. He is relentless in his quest to fulfill The Creator's request ... and he flashes his ""Gladiator"" glare on a few occasions. Rather than an uplifting childhood bedtime story, this Noah carries the burden of God, his own family and the survival of all beings ... his days are filled with moral dilemmas much larger than what you and I go through.With all the miscommunication afforded by email and text these days, imagine if God conversed with you through images in your dreams. Maybe that process creates some areas of gray? Not if you are Noah. I guess he only dreams when God wants to show him something, so his decision making and mission is pretty focused. He is to build a giant floating warehouse to save two of every creature. Yes, that means a lot of death for those not invited. See, God is using Noah and his family to help cleanse the earth of mankind ... God is ready for a re-boot. He is really not happy with how mean and nasty man has become ever since that whole apple debacle and the murder of Abel by Cain.Some of the visual effects are spectacular. I especially enjoyed the high-speed montage showing the creation of life ... you know that first week. Also, the beginning of the flood is quite a spectacle, but the ark itself is actually quite stunning ... constructed per the size noted in the Bible. The animals are all digitally created and we actually see little of them, though the on-boarding process goes remarkably smooth - considering this happens before the herbal sleep concoction is disbursed.Most of the discussion will probably be on The Watchers ... the fallen angels who once tried to help mankind, and for their efforts, God turned them into giant stone creatures. I will add that The Watchers need a new nickname since they did the bulk of the manual labor in constructing the arc and then protecting it ... not much watching going on for these poor guys (voiced by Nick Nolte and Frank Langella, among others).Noah's wife is played by Jennifer Connelly and their sons are played by Logan Lerman, Douglas Booth and Leo McHugh Carroll. They welcome Emma Watson into their family in what turns into a very odd plot twist, and the villain, Tubal-Cain is payed by Ray Winstone. Methuselah, Noah's grandfather, is played to the hilt by Anthony Hopkins. All of these characters are pretty one dimensional, but this is Noah's story. The burden he carries is quite heavy and his decisions aren't always popular.If you are looking for the well documented story of Noah, it's no mystery what book you should be reading. If you are after a pretty impressive visual interpretation, you could certainly do worse than Aronofsky's take. And the best news ... no Morgan Freeman voice-over!",Noah

Darren Aronofsky has directed such great visual films as Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan but here he presents a pathetic charade that barely scratches the surface on the account in Genesis where Noah is given visions from God to build an ark for he and his family as well as two of every animal because God was set to destroy the earth via flood due to man's rebellious nature. We have giant rock creatures that were apparently fallen angels. We have rebellious attitudes from Noah's son Ham in regards to mating, which goes against the fact that Genesis states that Noah's children were on board with their wives. Russell Crowe plays Noah as a barbaric nut case who battles enemies including an ark stowaway that results in a brutal fight. Jennifer Connelly plays his wife. Anthony Hopkins is totally over the top as Noah's father who lives in the mountains. Emma Watson plays a young female found who could not bare children and is touched by Hopkins and given the ability. Then she bangs one of Noah's sons and has twins, which Noah nearly daggers. Finally we have a useless appearance by Ray Winstone as the film's villain. He apparently stows away and gets into a fist fight with Noah. Christians are at opposites ends with this film and despite it getting some folks looking at scripture for themselves, it doesn't change the fact that the story is moderated to action, violence, and a visual world that doesn't fit.

A Roland Emmerich grand disaster movie treatment of the flood would have provided some sweep and spectacle to wow at for at least 20 minutes. Instead the flood seemed passed over and the animals were also given scant screen time compared to the high seas family drama. Three ludicrous things were the CGI monsters, the crazy king and the fighting that looked beyond the abilities of the portly Mr Crowe.

30,JamesHitchcock,"There was only one thing to do. We went straight out to watch ""Noah"".",6,19 April 2014,"Last week I received, for the first time ever, an email telling me not to watch a particular movie. The film in question was ""Noah"", and the email originated with Christian fundamentalists who objected to the film's departure from the traditional Bible story, to its blackening the character of someone fundamentalists believe to have been a real historical individual and to its environmentalist message. (Some fundamentalists, it would appear, regard concern for the environment as a sin, or at least a heresy). There was only one thing to do. My wife and I went straight out to watch ""Noah"". Let me make my position clear. The story of Noah's Ark is a myth. I use that word in the same sense as William Golding, who said that a myth is not a lie but a truth which cannot be told except through a story. Nevertheless, a myth, even in Golding's sense, is not a literal historical fact. There is no evidence to support the thesis that the Great Flood was an actual historical event, and plenty to refute it. (In which we can perhaps take comfort. If the literal truth of the Flood narrative could be proved, it would indicate that our planet was ruled by a harsh, wrathful and unforgiving deity, quite at odds with the loving God of Christianity). What Darren Aronofsky, the director and writer of this film, has tried to do is to interpret the Noah myth for the twenty-first century rather than imitating the Old Testament epics of the fifties and sixties. There is not enough space in this review to set out all the discrepancies between this version and the Biblical one, but I will concentrate on some of the more important. The Bible is never explicit about the nature of the sins which persuaded God to send the Flood, but in this version humanity has built an industrial civilisation following the expulsion of Adam and Eve from paradise. This civilisation has polluted the earth and consumed its resources, resulting in a world inhabited by selfish, brutal people continually at war over the little that remains. Aronofsky thus links the story of Noah with modern concerns for the environment. The Bible states that Noah was accompanied on the Ark by his wife, his three sons and their wives. In this version Japheth is a young boy and Ham is an adult but unmarried. Only Shem is married, but his wife, Ila, is believed to be barren. Noah has come to believe that the Creator (as God is always referred to in the film) wants the human race to end with the deaths of him and his family, leaving an earth inhabited only by animals. When Ila unexpectedly becomes pregnant on the Ark and gives birth to twin daughters, Noah is confronted with a dilemma. Should he kill his grand-daughters, thus ensuring the extinction of humanity, or should he show mercy and thereby defy what he believes to be the divine will? In the Bible the only persons aboard the Ark are Noah and his family, but here there is another survivor, the evil king Tubal-Cain, who has somehow managed to escape the flood by stowing himself on the Ark, where he plots to sabotage Noah's plans and manages to turn Ham against his father. Another important character is Noah's grandfather, Methuselah, played here as a wise old man. This is not Russell Crowe's best performance, but even so he struck me as the right man for the job. In some ways Crowe reminds me of the late Charlton Heston, perhaps the greatest exponent of the epic style of acting, and he is one of the few modern actors with the power and monumentality needed for films of this type. Some years back Crowe took the lead in the first modern Classical epic, Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", and he has now done the same in the first modern Biblical epic. This is in many ways a flawed movie. The Watchers, fallen angels who have been turned to stone, were horribly unconvincing, like refugees from some third-rate ""Lord of the Rings"" rip-off. (The battle between the Watchers and Tubal-Cain's men clearly showed the influence of Peter Jackson's great trilogy). For a film about the Ark, the animals play a surprisingly minor role. Aronofsky seems not to have been properly thought through the implications of omitting the wives of Ham and Japheth and introducing that contrived sub-plot about Ila's daughters; one rather disturbing implication is that the entire human race is descended from two incestuous marriages between these girls and their uncles. As if it wasn't disturbing enough to learn that we are all descended from Russell Crowe!Both my wife and I were very disappointed by this film, she because she was expecting something more like DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"", one of her favourite films, I because I was expecting something more comparable in quality to Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"", which I regard as one of the greatest films of recent years. And yet one cannot say that ""Noah"" lacks ambition. There are not many recent movies which, in addition to environmentalism and relationships within the family, also deal with such weighty theological topics as sin, the relationship between man and God, determinism versus free will, divine justice versus divine mercy and the question of whether morality should be based upon reason and conscience or upon obedience to divine commands. For all the film's faults, Aronofsky deserves some credit for using the epic form to tackle such questions, not merely to provide spectacle. 6/10",Noah

Being an agnostic myself, I never read Bible, so there is no religious transgression in my framework, the hub of the story is a simple allegory of a battling conscience, as the protagonists in other Aronofsky's films, BLACK SWAN, THE WRESTLER (2008, 8/10), THE FOUNTAIN (2006, 8/10), Noah (Crowe) is also facing a difficult task, his firm determination is only foiled at the very last moment, although we all can predict his act, since otherwise it is plainly too pessimistic for a mainstream picture. But here is another problematic theory, if the story is true, being genetically-conscious, we are all from the same lineage of an incestuous family (the only sperm donors for the twin girls are either Noah's other sons or some cousins from their mother side), so the human stains are innate in our bloodline, we are destined to carry our impaired blood forever, from a long run, the cleanse of mankind by the deluge is pointless, if God does want a fresh start, the minimum he could do is to cherry-pick a bunch of good-hearted families instead of only Noah's family, otherwise, Noah is right, God's intention is to erase the human race completely. After receiving God's message, Noah brings his entire family to the Watchers' territory (their incarnation as rock monsters is too video-generated and preposterous), where he discusses his task with his grandfather Methuselah (Hopkins), a senior sage who gives Noah a seed from Eden, besides his sorcery prowess is very crucial for the following story. The only outsider in the family is Ila (Watson), a young girl saved by the family and is barren because of her wound, Ila and Noah's oldest son Shem (Booth) are childhood sweetheart, but Ham (Lerman), Noah's second son, is distraught with no female counterpart is his life. While Noah's family and the Watchers are building the ark, the spectacle arrives with animals and humans led by Tubal-cain (Winstone). Things will further instigate Ham's hatred towards Noah and after a formidable battle to debar his own kind from embarking on the ark, the deluge turns up just on time, only Tubal-cain sneaks into the ark, others are all perished. In the ark, Noah is infuriated to learn Ila is pregnant, thanks to a request to Methuselah from Naameh (Connelly), Noah's wife. He will not allow any reproduction in the new world, a familial strife will deteriorate into bloody violence (with the ambush of Tubal-cain and his scheme to turn Ham against his own father). Crowe is back treading the boards to mold a more complicated character than we assume, Noah is never a benevolent character, he has the gut to leave thousands dying under his gaze and in the second half, he almost morphs into a villain, bigoted and possessed with his task, he is murderous and only innocent souls can save him from his possession. Also he suffers from survivor's guilt, Crowe's trademark brooding glower has found a right place to exhibit. Connelly, is at her wheelhouse to play a relentless and loyal wife stands by her husband, but an emotional charge for her to challenge Noah's decision is fervently emitted, a mother's nature is the most powerful weapon. Winstone is straightforwardly typecast with his menacing aura and Lerman, excels in discharging his scornful vacillation in the game, saves the suspense in the climax, Watson and Booth make a rather cute couple, and Hopkins is either freewheeling in his berry- hunting outing, or rendering wisdom with his occult magic. On a whole, NOAH is a successfully engaging film, but under the belt of Aronofsky, it seems a big-budgeted saga is not his strongest suit, the animal menagerie and deluge extravaganza are neither substantially eye-opening or awe-inspiring (honestly speaking, THE FOUNTAIN is far more impressive), but he surely masters in delineating the inner-struggle of an individual and thrusting the contradiction into a cinematic scenario to let it ferment, and it always leaves indelible pizazz.",Noah

33,sddavis63,OK ... Well ... That Was Weird,2,18 August 2014,"I'm aware of some pretty scathing comments coming from the Christian community about this movie. And I'll state outright - I'm a Christian, and a pastor. Even with that background, this movie didn't offend me from a religious perspective. I understand it's a Hollywood production. I also understand the criticisms. You expect that a movie called ""Noah"" is going to have something to do with Noah. You know. The biblical story. From Genesis. This movie has little to do with the biblical story. It's definitely Hollywood's account of the great flood and what led up to it. But I could accept that. Embellishing the biblical story to make a mainstream movie is fine. But only if it makes a GOOD mainstream movie. This was anything but. It was just a bad movie. A silly movie even. It seemed cartoonish much of the way through. It has some decent cast members. Russell Crowe in the title role, Jennifer Connelly as his wife, and even Anthony Hopkins in the role of Methusaleh. I can only assume that either they were all in desperate need of paycheques or that they didn't bother reading the script. If I were an actor, I sure wouldn't want this on my resume for the rest of my career.The poor script and inane dialogue aside, let me deal with the issues of cartoonishness and silliness. Who were ""The Watchers""? Those strange light beings apparently imprisoned in rock by God because they didn't do such a good job of looking after Adam and Eve? Was that the explanation? They made no sense. They were poorly (and very poorly) animated. They appear very quickly and their very appearance caused my evaluation of the movie to drop almost right away. And they stayed around - for the whole messy thing. There was no escape from them. And my eyes rolled every time I saw them.You know what? You could actually make a pretty decent movie out of the story of Noah. You know what else? This ain't that pretty good movie that could have been made. For the sheer amount of creativity in coming up with some of the non-biblical embellishments (especially The Watchers) I suppose someone deserves some credit - even if much of this was downright silly. That little bit of credit explains why this gets 2/10 from me.",Noah
34,Hellmant,Usually nonbelievers are the best choices for doing God's work.,9,4 April 2014,"'NOAH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Darren Aronofsky's big budget epic fantasy film based on the classic biblical story of 'Noah's Ark'. It stars Russell Crowe as the title character and co-stars Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Ray Winstone, Douglas Booth, Leo McHugh Carroll and Anthony Hopkins. Aronofsky directed and co-wrote the flick with Ari Handel; who has served as a producer on four of Aronofsky's films (including this one) and also co-wrote another extremely ambitious epic fantasy film (with Aronofsky) called 'THE FOUNTAIN' (which also dealt with similar themes, including faith and spirituality). I found this movie to be a very interesting and visually spectacular take on the beloved religious tale.Aronofsky of course takes a lot of artistic liberties with the rather short bible passage and expands it into a 2 hour and 18 minute ($125 million budgeted) film! It centers around Noah (Crowe) having a vision of life on Earth's destruction (through a coming flood) and feeling he's been called on, by God, to save all it's innocent creatures (the animals, excluding humans). He builds an ark, with his family, to save two of every animal from extinction (a male and a female, so they can procreate). He finds opposition from humans, lead by King Tubal-Cain (Winstone), who want his vessel for themselves. Noah acquires support from angels though, trapped on Earth as rock people, punished by God for disobedience long ago. His faith and love (for his family) are put to the ultimate test when he must decide whether to follow all of God's wishes or not.The movie has been heavily criticized (by some religious groups) for the creative liberties it takes with it's source material (while being praised by other church goers) but the only changes the film actually makes to the original bible story are expansions of details and things no one could possibly know the accuracy to or not. It's possible that Aronofsky was called on, by God, to tell this story (just like Noah was called on to do his bidding in the tale he's trying to tell); no one can honestly claim to know how truthful the film actually is (to history). It's true that Aronofsky is not a Christian (or a jew) but usually nonbelievers are the best choices for doing God's work (as they're usually less corrupted and more pure of heart). Regardless of whether you believe this story to be true or not (or a complete work of fiction) it's still a great film and an inspiring, thought provoking, story. It's perhaps a little too ambitious and not as involving or beautifully touching as Aronofsky's best work but that's the nature of the project he's chosen to undertake. The performances are great (especially Crowe) and the flick is a very memorable near masterpiece at any rate.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmQgAuI0jpQ&feature=gp-n-y",Noah
35,Buddy-51,Bold but flawed interpretation of the bible story,6,8 December 2014,"After years of studying novel-into-film adaptations, I've come up with what I think is a pretty reliable rule-of-thumb: namely, that for every 75 to 100 pages in a book, there should be a corresponding one hour of film. That's why 200-page novels generally make much better movies than, say, five or six-hundred page works. And it also explains why, for even larger tomes, the TV miniseries is probably the better way to go if you want to wind up with a reasonably faithful adaptation of a story. (Hence the superiority, say, of the 15-hour 1972 BBC adaptation of ""War and Peace"" over its various, decidedly shorter cinematic counterparts). But what if the problem lies in the opposite direction; what if the original work is too short to satisfy the demands of a full-length feature film? That's when you need to haul in a whole slew of other characters and plot devices to help pad out the length. Sometimes it works beautifully (as with ""Brokeback Mountain""), but that is clearly not always the case. And what if, as in the case of ""Noah,"" the original story barely fills up three double-columned pages in a standard Bible? Then you'd better hope you have a writer sufficiently creative enough to start filling in the gaps. The problem, though, is that when it comes to the Bible, people can get awfully touchy if you wander too far off the original text. And that's exactly the problem Darren Aronofsky (along with his co-writer Ari Handel) found himself facing with his two-hour-and-eighteen-minute dramatization of that most famous of ancient flood stories. A lot of feathers got ruffled.And it's not hard to see why. The description the Bible gives of the world before the flood is pretty sketchy, to say the least, so that leaves a fertile field for Aronofsky's imagination to work in. And work in it he does. In Aronofsky's vision, the earth, since the Fall in Eden, has become a veritable wasteland of barren plains and oozing mud, a place where it never rains but where plants can sprout up spontaneously when even the merest drop of water touches the ground. The animals are unfamiliar to us today (no elephants or giraffes boarding this ark!), and the giants, who are kept as vague as possible in the Biblical account, have become a race of humongous stone creatures who provide the labor for Noah's massive building project. The world is overrun by hordes of roaming marauders who have been descending further and further into wickedness ever since humans were cast out of the Garden. It is this race of depredated Man that ""the Creator"" has chosen to wipe off the face of the earth, leaving only Noah and his family to ride out the deluge in safety until the floodwaters have receded. Noah's relationship with the Creator (the word ""God"" is never uttered) is not your typical one of a booming voice bellowing down instructions from the heavens. Instead, Noah seems to intuit what it is he's supposed to do and the reason behind the Creator's doing all this in the first place.And this is where the script really deviates from the original text and where the filmmaker outraged his most literal-minded critics. For God's purpose, it turns out, is NOT to spare Noah so that he and his descendants can then repopulate the earth, giving the human race a second chance to get things right this time. Rather, God's purpose, as Aronofsky sees it, is to save only the innocent animals, then let Noah's line die out due to a lack of fertile women. That explains why his sons, Japheth, Seth and Ham, have no wives in this version and why the one young woman aboard - an orphan child he raised as his own daughter - is purportedly barren (we have to assume that Mrs. Noah is past her child-bearing years, despite the fact that Jennifer Connelly doesn't look all that much older than Emma Watson).Oddly enough, my real objection is not to Aronofsky's total shifting of the purpose of the original story. The real problem in Aronofsky's interpretation is that it reduces Noah to an unnecessary middle man in God's plan. Why not just have the rock creatures build the ark and leave Noah and his family out of it altogether? Is Noah around just to open the door and let all the animals out after the floodwaters have receded? (They don't need any feeding or care while on the boat because they are placed in a state of hibernation for the duration of the event). Or did Noah simply misinterpret God's intentions because his intuition was not quite as attuned to the Creator's wishes as he had led himself to believe?There are some good things in the movie to be sure. Russell Crowe is centered and focused as the morally conflicted Noah. Anthony Hopkins also makes an appearance as Methuselah. And there is a short but visually stunning montage sequence dramatizing the history of the world from creation to the flood that deftly incorporates elements of the Big Bang and evolution into the narrative. The movie also grapples with the morality of a creator who would wipe out virtually all human life, even though the movie (as opposed to the Bible) makes it clear that not ALL the humans left to drown in the floodwaters are irredeemably wicked. The special effects are impressive, though the animated rocks are a bit much and too often threaten to deflect the movie into the realm of the comical.As with Baz Luhrmann's audacious but deeply flawed adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby,"" when it comes to Aronofsky's stab at the Bible, you may not particularly care for the results, but you've still got to admire the effort.",Noah
36,cherold,Different biblical movie that fails to better the genre,3,22 June 2017,"Noah is a biblical epic that's not particularly attached the source material, something made abundantly clear with the appearance of its Transformers-like rock monsters. Hollywood has often expanded on the stories in the bible, adding details to make its short, expositional stories more engaging. But they have rarely used the ""loosely based on"" approach of Noah.Unfortunately, while the approach is different in some ways, the movie also has the slow, ponderous quality of many old testament film spectacles, only even more ponderous, slow, and pretentious. It's as though the director watched the worst of 50s-era bible movies and said, with modern technology, I can make something much worse than this.Is this slow, soggy mess really Darren Aronofsky? That's the name on the credits, yet this is not the movie you'll want to watch if you are looking for a Darren Aronofsky-style film. And if you're looking for a big-budget epic, well, even the big ""setting sail"" scene is no more than okay.After the tedious first half hour I started skipping forward, which gave me a chance to see the aforementioned sailing scene, the one excellent moment of the movie, the evolution scene (just watch it on youtube), and the film's dark take on Noah. Nothing I saw made me want to actually watch the rest of this.Departing from biblical source material was not, in itself, a bad idea. I liked the idea of God communication visually through dreams, and of people saying ""creator"" instead of ""God,"" and it was interesting to see a creature that didn't make it onto the ark. But the movie doesn't really have much to say about anything and is less entertaining than any hokey old Cecile B DeMille picture.With a director as brilliant as Aronofsky, it's tempting to watch even their worst movies to see if there's a spark of brilliance. But watching this is on a par with watching David Lynch's Dune. Don't do it.",Noah

38,Robert_duder,Brilliant...yah I said it...tear me apart but this was truly outstanding,9,1 April 2014,"First of all let me make clear I don't care about any of the controversy. I don't care if you want to sit in front of me and trash talk the historical accuracy, the biblical aspects, or how much you hate Jesus and therefore this movie inevitably sucks. As one professional reviewer pointed out, controversy aside this is a good time at the movies! From the first trailer I was excited and my expectations only grew. I knew the potential for it being some bizarre anti-Christian piece was high but I was willing to try it and excited to do so. Simply put...wow...my expectations were met and exceeded and this is now the best film I have seen thus far in 2014. I am not fan of blatant CGI and I thought Noah used it near-brilliantly. The entire animal kingdom was CGI but it was so blatantly awful that you scoffed at it. Noah's heart and soul comes from its unique and liberal perspective of the story. I have great respect for them for looking at the tradition Christian story and saying, there are issues there but here is how this could have happened. They incorporated brilliant religious symbolism and characters, gave Noah a diverse character with incredible depth, an edge of your seat story of politics and the world as they know it. No one knows what the world was like then...no one. We have snippets and conjecture and this is by far the most brilliant rendition of that time. They liberally create animals that may have been or the giants that the bible speaks of and the barren, nearly steam punk world that exists around them. I was floored.I have always enjoyed Russell Crowe though I felt like he has hit some major speed bumps in his career. This role was perfect for him and he absolutely nailed it. He is dark brooding, full of faith and love for his family. He is driven and disgusted with the world and the scenes of his fighting with his faith are just gut wrenching and brilliant. Crowe is superb. Jennifer Connelly was good in her role as Noah's wife. Their chemistry is terrific but I felt like perhaps her character is very much in the background and doesn't get a lot of chance to shine. She has some good scenes but her performance lacks some of the power of the others in the film. Anthony Hopkins was terrific in a much more subtle way as Methuselah. Hopkins captures an undeniable strength and wisdom to his character. His scenes are immediately captivating and he doesn't really have that many but they are so important and so well performed. (Also I also want to address the many apparently slow IMDb forum trolls who were wondering about Hopkin's character performing ""magic."") He was performing miracles via the creator as his faith was as strong as anyones. Emma Watson, Logan Lerman and Douglas Booth were all very good as Noah's children. They each have a scene or more that was truly terrific and their chemistry together was really good as it was with Crowe as well. Ray Winstone was very good in his role...however...he was also the one major flaw in the film. He was used as the ""big"" villain and I think his character was unnecessary and the story of him getting inside the ark was unnecessary, clumsy and pointless. It was literally the one thing that made me feel like this was a 9 and not a 10 for me. I liked Winstone, he did a perfectly solid job in the role but the character was unnecessary.I am not a Darren Aronofsky fan. I thought Black Swan was terrible, The Fountain was just way out there and The Wrestler was average. Well he has won me over with this because what he has created here is cinema masterpiece. The cinematography, the use of CGI, the world he creates. This is the key. You feel completely immersed in this world that we know nothing about. This isn't even truly a disaster film. This is a film about faith, love, family, God and yes there is some blatant messages about the direction of the world we live in now. This is the type of film, for me, that I can and will watch over and over again and get something different from it, notice something more or different or take something away from it. I cannot figure out why Christians would be angry and boycott this. This is easily the best example of Old Testament world ever created. It does take some liberties because it has to but there isn't anything here to squash the Christian faith or the traditional story. I absolutely LOVED the fallen angel giants (Nephilim for those of you wanting to look more into it.) Was the film completely scriptural? NO. But they also didn't ignore it and embraced the concepts. Visually stunning, brilliantly acted, and just an incredible experience. It won't get the accolades it deserves as far as I'm concerned. 9.5/10",Noah
39,Lejink,Rainers of the lost ark,3,25 December 2015,"I'm not greatly up on the Biblical story but I figured it would be quite difficult to elaborate the story of Noah and the Ark beyond the one-shot climax of the flood and so it proved. Moreover, I didn't expect to see Noah carry himself like a Ninjah in almost his first scene in the movie, dispatching three armed hunters who are closing in on the wounded animal they are intent on killing. The more the film went on the more unbelievable the plot became, with Ray Winstone playing a traditional baddie in leading his horde of warriors to take the ark, the way that he alone manages to board the ark in the face of not only the torrential rains but also the rearguard fought by Noah's protectors The Watchers, who turn out to be sort-of stone-made Transformers is the best way I can describe them.I could go on, with only occasionally it seemed to me the story in the scriptures breaking through with very little of the recognisable sayings of the Biblical characters making an appearance. Instead, Winstone's war-chief posits the old man-above-God argument to his troops and later to Noah's errant son Ham, who becomes his improbable accomplice aboard the Ark, the latter a tad upset with his old, and I mean old man for not saving his girlfriend of about ten minutes who he's encountered trying to clamber out of a mass grave.To me the story just reduced and trivialised the epic story of the Bible to satisfy a modern audience hungry for special effects, a bit of passion and some angst among the younger characters. I wasn't convinced by the special effects in any case, none of the animals looked real, the crowd scenes seem to have been dropped in from ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and the method of the Watchers' ascension back to the Creator on their deaths, I seem to recall from the original Star Trek series of the 60's.The acting throughout was a mixture of the clichéd (Winstone), stolid (Crowe), over-the-top (Watson) and insipid (Connelly). I couldn't help but laugh when Winstone talked about the ""wowld"" in his native Cockney. Anthony Hopkins is similarly unconvincing as the Yoda-like Methuselah. The pacing of the direction throughout is torpid and again like ""Lord Of The Rings"", we have to endure a boring extended epilogue after the flood which clearly should have climaxed the film. People used to mock Cecil B De Mille for the liberties he took in his Biblical epics but at least he did so with flair and spectacle. This damp, hyper-realistic, boring re-telling of Noah's was just a wash-out from where I was sitting.",Noah
40,dromasca,ecological and moral dilemmas before history begun,5,10 December 2016,"I have a hard time placing this film. On one side it's so typically hollywoodish - it's a super-production with Bible-related content that would make it probably to many Christian films festivals. It's very conventional in its ecological message and the morality tale that it tells is quite conventional, and of course, we know the end of the story, either because we have read the bible, or because we have seen enough films from Hollywood or for both reasons. On the other side it's a film by Darren Aronofsky, so there is a dose of madness in its characters. The special effects are 100% created for the movie (no real life animal image was used). There are pieces of cinema quality which eventually help this film not to completely drown in the big waters.So it's the story of the apocalyptic flood with several twists. Some of them are that Noah (who is five centuries old in the Bible story) is a father of a not so happy family and is a vegetarian. The other is that the Giants take an active part in the story and they resemble The Transformers. Then we have the moral dilemma and the lead character who is put to test by God in a way that rather resembles the story of Abraham rather than the one of Noah. The mix between fanaticism and madness is not completely lost for anybody who read the Old Testament, many of its heroes are put to test by their God in a way that cannot be judged by modern reality tests, and their responses are in many cases appropriate. Russell Crowe is an excellent fit for the role, at least for its non-Gladiator parts.With a moralistic story that is impossible to tell in credible terms and with an overdose of ecological and pacifistic messages, the film could have easily slid into complete ridicule. What saves it are elements of professionalism in the story telling, solid (but not stellar acting) from stars like Crow, Jennifer Connelly (back in a film of Aronofsky after the unforgettable Requiem for a Dream), Emma Watson, Anthony Hopkins (fun wig), and the computer-generated special effects which succeed to create a level of thrill to a story that was so many times already painted if not filmed. But did we really need a Darren Aronofsky for all these?",Noah
41,ThomasDrufke,Entertaining Even With It Not Being Entirely Devoteful,7,9 September 2014,"Regardless of your beliefs, (in fact I don't think God is said once throughout the entire film) I think Noah can be an entertaining ride. It may not be the exact Noah story so many people love, but it's wonderfully acted and beautifully shot. I didn't go into this film for a bible lesson, I went in hoping for a good experience and at least a thought provoking one. I wasn't disappointed. This film actually has quite a few redeeming qualities to it. But of course it has quite a few scratch-your-head moments as well.Within the first 5 minutes you are immediately sucked into this world. The cinematography is incredible and breathless. I found myself engulfed into the world with all of these fascinating characters. I can't say that about many films. It's too often that you see the actors right through their characters. Everyone from Crowe to Connelly to Watson all were extraordinary. It's a tribute to Aronofsky's script and direction. Crowe was at the top of his game in perhaps one of his best performances of his career. At the very least it's one of his most complex characters he's ever played.But I did have a few problems with the film. It's over 2 hours long and yet the actual storm/end of the world scene is maybe 15 minutes. I also grew tired of Lerman's whiny portrayal of his son. There was never any signs before of him resenting his father but yet when he is unable to bring a girl on the boat, he can't stand the sight of him. I hardly believe this would cause enough hate to want to kill his own father. I was also hoping for the eldest son to play a bigger part in the story, to no avail.I loved Clint Mansell's score. I thought it was very different and original from his other work but still had his signature written all over it. But the real star of the film is Darren Aronofsky. After hearing about how hard he had to fight to get this movie made and seeing the final cut, I was very impressed. I don't think it deserves as much gripe as some people are giving it. It's not a great film, but it's an enjoyable one at the very least, led by some great performances.+Crowe is astounding +Beautiful and Visceral +Great story without being overly religious +Clint Mansell's score -Storm sequence should have been longer -Lerman's whiny character 7.6/10",Noah
42,g-bodyl,Very Impressive Retelling!,10,7 March 2015,"Darren Aronofsky's Noah is a visionary retelling of the classic Bible story regarding Noah and the Great Flood. The movie definitely does not stay true to its source, but I could use a fantasy retelling without sacrificing the main themes, and that is exactly what we got. Of course there are no talking rock monsters or volcanoes in the real story, but it added a Lord of the Rings style to the movie. The visuals are impressive, and that is evident during the scenes where the animals are moving towards the ark. Aronofsky's film is about Noah and his creation of an arc for him and his family due to God's displeasure at mankind by creating a flood. Noah must battle with himself and other mankind if he wants to successfully be a part of God's vision. The film is well-acted and features magnificent performances from everyone. Russell Crowe does a very fine job as Noah and his acting skills are at its peak during his inner fights when he has to make very difficult choices. Jennifer Connelly did a great job as his wife. Ray Winstone delivers a delicious performance as Noah's manly nemesis. Emma Watson and Logan Lerman deliver great performances. Finally, Anthony Hopkins makes a surprising, but good cameo as Noah's grandfather. Overall, this was a fantastic action/adventure film. The story is a new spin on the classic Bible tale and I really enjoyed it. It's funny to see how many people wanted a true, faithful adaptation. I just wanted entertainment and this film does its job very masterfully. It Makes good use of the CGI and I was impressed with the rock people. Noah is not an action hero in reality, but he made a good one here. One of the best films of early 2014, and it seems I'm one of the few partaking in that thought. My Grade: A+",Noah
43,cricketbat,...wut?,3,31 December 2018,"...wut? If this were a sci-fi/fantasy film with allusions to the famous Biblical story then it might have been more palatable, but this movie is trying to tell the story of Noah, a very well-known tale, so each and every alteration is noticeable. And some of the changes were just plain weird. However, even without the deviations from the Bible, this is a long-winded, heavy-handed, melodramatic mess with a few cool visuals.",Noah
44,lesleyharris30,"Dramatic and Breathtaking Adventure,",8,12 September 2014,"Noah is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.It is an action packed movie filled with some very intense performances,it was certainly an interesting way of teaching the story of Noah's Ark in a modernised way that will keep today's generation interested.Russell Crowe as Noah was practically perfect casting,the minute I heard he was playing him I knew it was a good decision and I wasn't disappointed in his performance,I also was impressed by the acting from Jennifer Connelly,Emma Watson,Anthony Hopkins and Douglas Booth.The movie certainly has its flaws,I felt the plot was slow at times and it certainly dragged out a little bit,but I also think we should have been given a bit more time in the beginning to know the characters so we could care for them more once they are in danger,also I think it would have looked so much better if the animals were real rather than clearly animated.Exciting and intense,Noah is a beautiful movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure film or drama. Noah is challenged with the task of gathering two of every animal in to a giant ark before a massive flood ensues. Best Performance: Russell Crowe",Noah
45,secondtake,Bloated epic not redeemed by Crowe or the dazzling special effects,4,3 August 2014,"Noah (2014)Ugh. The poor actors, pouring their hearts into this bloated, irrelevant movie. Yeah, the story is really good, at least the parts that we all know so well—the flood, the feeling of starting over, the human angst, or even the idea that there was another (evil) civilization before the flood which is now lost.Director Darren Aronofsky is of course a creative force with a lot of admirers, and his films are always at least interesting. He took a lot of money here and used some innovative special effects, and he tried to take a slim story (Noah and the Ark) and make it an over-long epic movie, which is daring enough.But it's not enough to spend a lot on special effects. Not enough to say profound nothings in serious intonations. Not enough to base the story on a great fable (or a bit of history if you're really going to think the flood happened the way it's portrayed) as if you can coattail your way into profit. Or respectability.Cameron Crowe does a good job being a rugged survivalist in the wastelands that are supposedly the Mideast. (If it looks like Iceland, it's because it is.) His wife is Jennifer Connelly, who is given lines of script to read that make her superfluous (like she'll offer a good suggestion and Crowe, as Noah, says no, let's do it this way instead). Misogyny in action. The kids are archetypally pretty and do a fine job being that, and being there.I sound almost bitter. It's just (largely) a boring waste. Of course there are, often, redeeming moments—dream sequences that are well done, or scenery that is visually beautiful. I like the idea of Noah struggling with his own values and issues. But this isn't enough to make the long movie work beyond its grandiose effects. Maybe the most interesting thing to happen is that an actual flood, from Hurricane Sandy, interrupted some of the filming in New York where the ark model had been built.You know whether you like this kind of movie—the Avatar, Prometheus, Braveheart epics —and whether you'll like this one. Those are my least favorite kinds of movies, and this one went frankly the farthest into that overwrought territory. Good luck!",Noah
46,Irishchatter,Its not like the original Noah who is part of the bible,2,14 May 2017,"My family and I were watching this on RTE 2, to be quite honest with you, this was pure pathetic. Hollywood thought it could do a movie about a religious icon from the history books and create it like its either Game of Thrones or Harry Potter. I thought Russell Crowe didn't do a good job as playing Noah because he looked too young and just played too much of a ""daddy"" role than a ""grandfather"". Maybe if they gave him heavy makeup or have an older person like Ian McKellen to play the part. Either way, it would make the film look better. I'm surprised that it was nominated a golden globe because I honestly didn't think this movie wasn't at all good and it was pretty effortless. Im giving this 2/10.........",Noah

48,cosmo_tiger,in terms of movies based on Noah and the ark this was better then Even Almighty...but that's not really saying a lot.,5,27 July 2014,"""Our family has been chosen for a great task, we've been chosen to protect the innocent."" Since the dawn of time man has shown he can be evil. When it gets to a point that it is too much the creator speaks to Noah (Crowe). He lets him know that an apocalyptic flood will be coming soon and wants Noah and his family to build an ark to protect the innocent animals during this time. Wanting to obey and not let the creator down he does what he is asked even though there is one thing that creates tension and disagreement among the family. Before I get into this I have to say that those looking for an accurate religious telling will be disappointed. This movie has an ark and a guy named Noah...that's about where the Bible story stops. The movie is closer to 2012 then a religious story. That out of the way I didn't like it. Not for the religious aspect but more for the fact that it was just slow moving and boring. When you think the movie has to be over and you check the time and see 45 min left that's not a good thing. I'm not exactly sure what could have made it better but there definitely was something missing. I think the fact that Noah himself was so unlikable it made it hard to get into the movie and root for someone. Also Anthony Hopkins playing a type of biblical Yoda seemed strange to me. When you watch this you will see what I mean. Overall, in terms of movies based on Noah and the ark this was better then Even Almighty...but that's not really saying a lot. I give this a C+.",Noah
49,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,1 August 2014,"NoahA good prank to play on God would've been for Noah to load the Ark with only same-sex animals.Unfortunately, there are few practical jokes to be found in this drama.Fed up with how corrupt humans have become, The Creator decides to cleanse Earth with a fatal flood.Sharing this with Noah (Russell Crowe) in a dream, The Creator instructs him to build a large vessel for him, his family (Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, Douglas Booth, Logan Lerman, Leo McHugh Carroll) and Earth's fauna to dwell in during the deluge. Standing in their way, however, is an army of the forsaken lead by the son of Cain (Ray Winstone).Loosely based on the biblical account, this visually striking re-imagining establishes its otherworldliness early on with angelic rock giants, but later balances it with earthbound quandaries concerning Noah's extremist views.In addition to animals, paddle boarders also survived the flood.

50,atlasmb,A Disappointing Tale,5,8 April 2014,"I am not a Bible thumper, but I would like to take a Bible and thump someone on the head with it--namely those who wrote this script. 'Noah"" is an imagining of the biblical story (not a reimagining because the Bible really doesn't have much to say about the flood story that people really want to know--the mechanics of it).My goal was to go into the theater considering this film to be separate work from the book (as I do with all films). If you pretend you know nothing of the original text, I am afraid this story does not stand well on its own.First of all, you would expect that Noah would be the hero of the story. Actually, he was about the least likable character in the film.Noah is a man who has what he takes to be revelatory dreams. Through them, he predicts future happenings and modifies his life accordingly. But he is a very bad ""prophet"", because he never seems sure he understood the messages. The most dramatic part of the film is when he tries to understand what the creator's intentions are for the race of man. He thinks he knows, and he makes bombastic speeches about it, but he obviously is not sure. Still, he acts on his best suspicions--or intends to act. When it comes down to it, he wavers. And a teenage girl has to explain to him the basics of free will.If you were hoping for some interesting explanations about the mechanics of the ark and how all those animals were saved, you will be disappointed. The explanation we get is like saying that Santa Claus manages to visit all the homes around the world in an impossibly short time because he has magic reindeer. In the story, Noah has helpers that are no less magical. And the depiction of every species of animal that crawls, walks or flies (since this story does not consider evolution, none of the species could have evolved after the flood) is very lame. I don't know what I expected, but it was something more realistic.I found the acting to be fine. The most enjoyable aspect of the film for me was Emma Watson's performance.The special effects were okay. But not enough to make me forget the deficiencies in the story.",Noah

Now i am not a really religious person myself, so i had no problems with this picture, although i knew the story (myth - call it as you like), it was interesting to see adaptation of it on the big screen. Visually, this film is truly stunning, very good special effects, good cinematography, set design - you can clearly see the big budget of this film on screen. The performances were uniformly good, although nothing very special. I can clearly understand why this film has got lots of negative reviews - if you create a movie based on some sort of religion - it's a risky thing, as there will always be half of audience, who will find it ""not close enough to material"", and ""Noah"" was clearly made for an 21th century audience - it has old story told in a modern way, which would appeal to mainstream audience, and yet the great Darren Aronofsky managed to create a good, stunningly looking film and leave some place for originality. Well done.",Noah
52,westsideschl,Kiosk <1,1,4 August 2014,"I was open and willing to give it a shot, well  Positive: I thought the apple shaped like a beating living heart held promise for a creative take on the time-worn apple metaphor. Negatives: 1. Storyline seemed like a hodgepodge of disjointed ideas thrown together in the shotgun hope of striking a note with as many viewers as possible, but ending up hitting none (well, a few) of us. 2. Why is it that light is always good and dark always evil? Haven't writers ever had to work graveyard shift? Or haven't they heard of nocturnal creatures? Or of chemosynthesis living creatures in the deep very dark oceans? Why not promote balance and give props to both? 3. The light encased in rock was clever and CGI quite good but I missed the point of this part of the disjointed plot. 4. Attention to detail is always important as an indicator of quality directing so how did (and why) Noah go from shaggy hair to a perfectly cut and cropped, with an electric trimmer, hair? And why? Another detail, the human population, according to the Bible's aging of Earth of about 5000 BCE, was relatively instantly created at about five million which means an average of one person for every twelve square miles. Yes, there are uninhabitable areas. The point is where did all those starving people come from that attacked the ark? And all the animals together at one time. 5. Another detail, why did all (ALL) our central characters look like runway fashion models - really thin and well groomed. Why do they pick famous actors only to have them stand out for their obvious individual mannerisms; just distracting from the storyline. Picky, I know. 6. What was with thesub-plot of sex and extended family. Didn't the Noah clan listen to Noah that humans were killing off the planet both in the physical environment and the biological environment. They seemed excessively self-centered for such stewards of Earth. 7. What was the thematic purpose of the anger management and fight scenes. 8. Pollyanna would be proud, all is worth saving with mercy and love, and goodness. Whoops, I forgot all about the warfare, preventable death from disease, preventable death from hunger, environmental destruction, etc.",Noah
53,ironhorse_iv,The end of the world is just the beginning. A flood of mixed results are coming.,6,14 April 2014,"With any biblical event, you'll see a lot of people with a lot of different interpretations of it. A lot of people has praise it, and a lot of has been complaining about Darren Arofonsky's movie based on the biblical story of Noah's Ark. It has provoked a storm of controversy about the right way to read the Old Testament, but let's remember, its one man take on it. We should listen to his ideas; even if you agree or disagree with him. Then judge forth. I think a lot of this negative criticize come from how sensitive, religion is, to some people. Some people don't like other people to question their beliefs, or change it to work with the times or even debate the subject. At less, I have to say, if you going to see this movie, be open to everything, because not everything in this movie seem to follow your views. For those who never heard of the story; the movie is about Noah (Russell Crowe) who is haunted by vivid dreams of the end of the world flooding. Believing it's the voice of God, he decide to build an Ark to store all of the creatures of the world and serve God by having his family be their guardians until the end of their days. Only problem is that his daughter in law, Ila (Emma Watson) is pregnant by one of his sons. He must question his beliefs, wondering if, it's God's will to wants all of mankind to be destroy or God wanting to baptize the world, for a chance of rebirth. The movie makes Noah as a dark, complicated character, torn between his beliefs. Russell Crowe is alright in the role, while he can pull off dramatic roles, he was truly type-cast as an action star here than a prophet. Honestly, some people might not like how Noah get turn nearly as a 'The Shining' type psychopath toward the more time at sea. The movie was even banned in some Muslim countries, because in Islam teachings, it is prohibited to act out any prophets. The way, he is indifferent from saving others is hard to watch—and even serve as a sub-plot between him and his son, Ham (Logan Lerman). Without spoiling much of it, the movie adds a lot of story to his children, and how much, they differ in views, life and death. The movie itself, delivers a theme of conflict of new life teachings against old traditional gnostic dogma in religion. The film was able to do this with symbolism, as Ila like the Earth was barren. People were cannibalism each other for a chance of life. It wasn't until the belief of God came to play, that life truly became reborn. Still, the film was really hard to enjoy, as it's so dark, gloomy and way too graphic violent for a PG-13 film. For me, Noah looks like a post-apocalypse movie than a biblical account of Genesis. There is a lot to this theory that makes it seem like it. We repeatedly see a silhouette replay of Cain killing Abel with a rock. And at one juncture, the sequence morphs into warlike conflicts throughout the ages, with the killer and victim becoming soldiers from ancient to modern times. The land was way too barren, as it looks like something out of a nuclear holocaust or over-mining hints Ray WInstone's character of Tubel Cain, which means miner or blacksmith. A lot of environment messages going on with this film. Even the animals in the film didn't seem right. I know, the movie was trying to stay out of PETA way, by having CGI Animals, but the animals seen in the film are ""slightly tweaked designs of real existing animals."" It makes it seem like the humans of Noah once did genetic engineering or the world had evolution or adapt over time. It's weird to see evolution in a religionist film. The CGI special effects were alright for the most part, but the Watchers AKA Nephilism were just awful distracting. They look nothing like fallen angels or Jewish stone golem, and more like Transformers. Remind me of robots. There is also another theory that states out that Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) in the film, was indeed God, as the Watchers tend to follow him. Not only that, he has the power of rebirth with the seed, and by his hand. When Methuselah chooses to die in the flood. He is allowing free thinking to happen again, allowing to decide if life should go on or not. It's just one idea. The thing, I hate about this bible story is, how God killing everybody with a flood. It doesn't put God in a good light in any way, shape or form. Enough said. That's more of the story's fault than the film. Don't hold on any historical account here as most of the film plays on mythological standpoint. Come with a suspense of disbelief. This story shouldn't be taken as truth, anyways. The movie didn't felt too preachy, which I like, and wasn't cater, just for one audience. After all, the flood story is not only a Christian or Jewish story. Deluge myth are found in other ancient cultures. Most of this story came from the Talmud to the Cuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia, anyways. Since, it wasn't cater to one audience. A lot of worrisome feedback from largely religious audiences at test screenings was cause by this. The aftermath of these screening, cause tensions between Aronofsky and Paramount over control of the final cut. Aronofsky said that he was very unhappy with Paramount testing alternate versions of Noah that were not 'true to his vision'. While, the movie serves conflict. I have to give credit, where credit do. Darren Arofonsky made a risky religion film that he knew would get backlash. It got people 'talking', so it was success in my book, no matter if people praise the film or hate it.",Noah
54,The-Sarkologist,A pretty cool movie about Noah's flood,8,12 January 2015,"To be honest, I actually thought that this was a pretty good movie. Maybe it was because I approached it with some skepticism, especially since I generally have not been too thrilled with many of Hollywood's more recent Biblical Epics, however this film really quite surprised me. I would probably consider it a fantasy film, not that I don't believe in a literal world wide flood (I do), but rather because there were a lot of elements in it that I would expect to come out of a fantasy film. Mind you, before you jump up and call me a fundamentalist, just because I believe in a world wide flood does not mean that I hold a literal interpretation of the Bible, but rather because there is a lot of anthropological evidence outside of the Bible that points to such a event (and I also think the idea of an antediluvian world where humans walked with dinosaurs is really cool).Anyway, what really surprised me was that the antediluvian world that Aronofsky created was actually what I expected the world to be like before the flood, and that is one that was dominated by a technologically advanced civilisation. However I also noted one thing in this film that Aronofsky implied that I did not consider previously, that that was that there wouldn't be any oil. I won't go into details on why, but I found it interesting that he had other methods of producing fire, which is one of the core elements required for civilisation.I have noted that some people have suggested that there are gnostic elements in the film, though I would probably suggest otherwise because there was no real suggestion that salvation came through specific knowledge. Okay, while the Bible is not clear on how God spoke to Noah, I did find the whole idea of the silent God to be something that seems to have been invoked simply because God seems to be silent in our time, however I do feel that maybe there was a lot more communication between God and Noah, but I digress. Also, I am not really sure about the lack of wives for Ham and Japtheth, and also Noah's belief that they were meant to be the last surviving humans in the world and their only task was to save the animals.However, the one theme that seems to be running through this film is the theme of environmentalism, especially when we consider the antediluvian world. It is clear, or at least it was clear to me, that the way that our technological society is heading conjures images of what the world could look like in the future – a world covered in barren and destroyed wastelands where all of the resources have been used up. There is also the idea that the world is ruled by tyrants who rule by might and seek to take whatever that want simply by declaring it to be theirs.Okay, there were a number of elements that suggest that the film was borrowing heavily from the young earth creationist theory in that there were only ten generations from Adam, and also that Tubal Cain and Methuselah were alive during the time of Noah. Mind you, this is all speculation (and poetic license) because we weren't there and as such we will never truly know what the situation was, just as we will never truly know if there really was a world wide flood. However, as an action/adventure movie, if we push all of our Biblical prejudices to one side, I think it is a great and enjoyable way to spend two and a half hours.",Noah
55,Reno-Rangan,"The same story, but a different Noah.",6,9 August 2014,"Usually everyone knows what it's about after reading the title, but the thing is how much it will surprise us with newly initiated contents like visuals, story alteration, performance and finally 3D. There are many versions of 'Noah's Ark' story including animations. So I expected it wouldn't work as a full-length feature film, Especially in live-shot version. But got a good response by performing decently everywhere. A perfect way to say about the movie is it was an ancient version of the movie '2012'. No science involved, only fantasies. Remember the character Noah was not exactly a good guy either bad in this story. He was portrayed in such a dark and complicated personality who take the responsibility that was given to him by the creator.After witnessing his father's murder, now Noah is a grown up lives with his wife and three children along with one adopted daughter. One night he dreams with the unclear visuals. The next day he visits his grandfather to know more what the dream is about. Then he comes to know the message and prepare to face it. In between, a war commence waged by a king to save humanity. Who wins, who loose and how it all happens comes later with a few brutal incidents.I like this director's 'The Wrestler' and 'Black Swan' than his other movies which were a massive hit. I expected this particular story could be more realistic manner, but I was wrong and it was a fairy-tale kind of approach made for grown ups. Why it suits only for adults? Because so many elements were too rude, especially inclusion of all the intense violences were not in favor of children to view. Other than that there's no nudity or sex scenes. All this is because of Noah was exhibited in such a strange shade. That end scene where Noah was drunk I can't even believe it. In the last half an hour Russell Crowe's role turns into what he did in 'Les Misérables' versus Emma Watson (Hermione, who was defenseless).''The rain has stopped but the creator has not smiled.''This is the story that must inspire the viewers, though it won't do that. One thing it did right was it was completely a different. Awesome visuals and really I enjoyed watching it in digital 3D. The cast was not bad at all, as being in a main role Russell Crowe had large portion and others were just into it to show their presence. Overall, I feel it was taken as a challenge by the filmmaker, but a well done work, definitely not offensive, maybe slightly regarding religious perspective. Entertainment wise, it was a better movie, especially for a film adaptation. In my opinion, I believe it is okay to see at once.",Noah
56,zkonedog,Not The Noah I Grew Up Reading About,1,2 March 2017,"Whether you believe the biblical story of Noah's Ark to be truth or fiction, few could dispute that it is quite a fantastic tale. I mean, a giant flood, two of every animal, and epic themes of man's wickedness. Ready-made for Hollywood, right? When the trailers first started hitting for this movie quite a while back, I thought it would be a surefire hit. The one kink I hadn't expected: Darren Aronofsky's complete and utter incompetence in deciphering what this movie experience should have been about.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Noah (Russell Crowe), who is told by the ""Creator"" (or God) to build an ark to survive a flood that will wipe nearly all of wicked humanity off of the planet while saving the animals and righteous few. So, Noah along with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and sons (Douglas Booth, Logan Lerman), sets out to complete the task. An orphan girl (played by Emma Watson) also joins the crew. Nothing is ""smooth sailing"" about building the Ark, however, as Noah is constant tormented by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), leader of the ravenous human colonies.The only positive thing I can say about ""Noah""? It had an epic feel to it. That is clear right from the beginning. Oh yeah, and Emma Watson steals basically every scene that she is in. However, Aronofsky screws things up so many times that by the end it turns into quite a mess. For example...-Introducing the concept of the Nephilim (fallen Angels) is interesting...but not as rock-creatures that resemble the Ents from the Lord of the Rings. A terrible choice right from the get-go. -The entire concept behind Noah and is Ark has NOTHING to do with environmentalism (no matter how much you try to force it, Darren). Men were not wicked because they were eating meat. They were wicked because they perverted God's ways and created a cesspool of humanity. Also, God did NOT value the animals over the humans. God basically just wanted to ""start over"" with two of each species, man or beast. It has nothing to do with the animals being ""purer"" than men. -The biggest problem of the entire film, though, is how Aronofsky intimates that Noah thinks God wants ALL humanity to die, even going so far as to put the fate of future offspring in doubt. There is NOTHING in the Bible that suggests this whatsoever, and even as a ""dramatized concept"" it is stupid. To put it simply, God recognized that only the line of Noah remained pure in heart and devoted to him, so he saved Noah's line along with the general eco-system (animals) of Earth in order to ""wipe the slate clean"". The purpose most assuredly was NOT to wipe humans off the face of the planet.It has been quite a while since I have been let down quite this much by a film that I thought would have so much more potential. Shame on you, Darren Aronofsky, for almost single- handedly destroying what could have been an epic masterpiece. It saddens me that you were unable to stick to the story itself (which would have provided enough drama for anyone else) and instead had to inject your high-handed ideals into the mix. You ruined it.",Noah
57,eddie_baggins,"Beautiful, frustrating, thrilling and cringewrothy: This is Noah for better or worse",6,1 April 2014,"Taken from the film-making diary of Darren Aronofsky - My Noah checklist: 1 - Must get a main actor that can grow a mean luscious beard: Check 2 - Get Hermione from Harry Potter: Check 3 - Allow Anthony Hopkins to demean himself with a berry scrounging role: Check 4 - Create giant rock monsters that resemble upon finish a Ray Harryhausen special effect: Check 5 - Never mention God once as to not offend the sceptics: Check 6 - Turn the story into some type of Dead Calm on an ark once the floods hit: Check 7 - Let my old mate Clint Mansell create an overbearing intrusive score: Check 8 - Create an at times idiotic, frustrating, yet at times well-acted and undeniably beautiful and thrilling film: Check Disclaimer: obviously this is not taken from anywhere and is completely made up, although for some reason I can't help but shake the feeling I might not be far off the actual mark.Joking aside and getting back on track in regards to the task at hand; Darren Aronofsky's dream project of turning the few chapters long Biblical tale of Noah into a full length feature film has taken narrative license to an all new level, with a much longer seeming 2 hour epic that gives us Noah as we've never seen him before, rock monsters included! Having the dubious honour of containing this year's first stand out cringe-worthy scene in the form of a berry hunting Anthony Hopkins, Noah is also a film that makes the statement of ""It's not about the journey it's about the destination"" seem tailored made for it, for upon films end there is no denying what you have just witnessed is a film of much wrong doing yet a film of much virtue. In tailoring the simple story of Noah into something much larger, Aronofsky has clearly bitten off more than his talented teeth can chew and ends up with a film that is at times unbelievably lame and in the next moment jaw-droppingly awesome.Always a keen eye for the beauty in films from his very first film PI, Noah allows Aronofsky's dreams to run wild on screen with stark barren landscapes, animal infested waters, life springing forth from nothing and perfectly framed shots of Russell Crowe and his ever impressive facial fuzz just some of the highlights that make Noah a big screen must despite its many narrative missteps. All this beauty that Aronofsky captures is complemented by some fine all round performances, in particular from grizzled lead Crowe who delivers what could be his best performance since A Beautiful Mind and Jennifer Connolly who again proves to us that she's one of the most powerful actresses in the business. Emma Watson is again solid as the new addition to the tale Ila with Logan Lerman, Anthony Hopkins and the misplaced cockney gangster that is Ray Winstone's Tubal-cain letting the team down in the acting stakes.With so much going on in this picture it's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes it the conflicting type of movie that it is. The first 40 minutes of this film offered nothing to me as a viewer and it's no wonder some may leave before the floods hit (as some kin of my co-blogger Jordan actually did) yet as mentioned earlier the end is what makes the journey worth it and the way in which Noah ties up its tale is without a doubt in my mind quietly powerful and relevantly thought provoking.This is not the Bible Noah, but Aronofsky's Noah, and only the years to follow will allow us to truly call Noah a success or a failure and the messing with the tale that at its core is relatively simple (seriously how quick was the ark built here and how long was the arks journey?!) works mainly against the film. I sit firmly on the fence with this well shot and acted film but would easily jump to its defence if someone were to try to demean a film that has many flaws yet more to say than countless other films these days and says them in a frequently eye-popping, stunning way.3 spiked cups of tea out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -",Noah
58,filipemanuelneto,"Original, but I expected something different and the movie shocks with that expectation.",4,1 March 2017,"Biblical themes are always pleasing in the movies, but they're also complex and require some care and attention. This Darren Aronofsky's was technically well done. The CGI allows for great scenes and extraordinary sequences, such as the creation of the world or the flood itself, mixing the biblical text with scientific facts we know today. Cinematography is great, with alternating moments of light and shadow, serving the purpose of characterizing and giving personality to the two opposing factions (the sons of Cain and the sons of Seth). Clint Mansell's soundtrack is equally impressive, creates a good ambiance and gives intensity in the right moments. The actors also did a good job, particularly the antagonistic duet Russell Crowe / Ray Winstone. They're very related to each other because they're the mirror of each other, insofar as one is all that the other isn't. The remaining cast is more restrained, allowing them to have some deserved protagonism. Anthony Hopkins appears in a small role but to which he conferred dignity. ""There are no small roles, there are little actors,"" isn't it? The worst of this movie? Two things: the first is to disappoint the expectations of the public. Whole movie seems a huge metaphor, as if the elements on scene were symbols meant to update the story and bring it closer to our reality. Taking the most striking example of this, the cities of the people of Cain are so savage and cruel that they seem to be dystopian metaphors of our great metropolis. If this was the director/writer's idea, then it's something quite original, but it shocked with all the expectations we might have, and, when that happens, it's so dangerous as a double-edged sword, as the audience can Not understand the intentions of the director. Even I was expecting something else, and even though I recognize the originality of the film, I still feel sorry for not being quite what I expected. The second problem of the film is those fallen angels invented by the director and surely influenced by the story of the angels revolt and their fall to the world.

So it's not this way i imagined this myth but it's OK for me as everybody can feel it personally as long as the message is kept. In that regard, the movie rings true and it soon becomes oppressive : there are familial tensions, destructive tribes. After the flood, the tension goes up because it's really in camera with absolutely nothing around ! I'm a bit surprised to see that this Noah feels like Abraham as he thinks he must sacrifice children. But the movie answers the dilemma with the only likely answer that Bible teaches us : love ! Aronofsky is still among the most innovative filmmakers today giving brilliant moments (the creation, the miracle of the forest,). The cast is experimented to stand the pressure.

60,leonblackwood,Expected better! 4/10,4,11 August 2014,"Review: What a epic movie! Personally, I thought that the film was way too long and it missed to key elements: animals and how he made the ark. I loved the watchers and when they were fighting of the humans but for some unknown reason, it really did drag. The son who was helping Ray Winstone was annoying because he was willing to risk everything for a girl that he only knew for 5 minutes. A thong Hopkins was brilliant and I was impressed with Emma Watson and Ray Winstone. The director didn't really spend that much time on explaining the whole point of the ark. He spent most of his time explaining how humans were destroying earth which could have been toned down a bit. At the end of the day, I was expecting a much better movie to portray such a story but it is watchable and enjoyable in parts. Round-Up: Russell Crowe hasn't really hit his peak as he did in Gladiator, for some time. He's had plenty of chances to prove himself in movies like Robin Hood, Man Of Steel and Les Miserables, which wasn't that good in my eyes. I would put it down to bad choices more than his performance, except for Robin Hood were he didn't know what to do with his accent. Anyway, his performance isn't that bad in this movie but the storyline could have done with some tweaking. Anthony Hopkins can't do anything wrong. He's not really in this movie that much, but he stole the screen in every one of his scenes. After playing Hermione in the Harry Potter franchise, Emily Watson shows a different side to her acting skills by bringing intensity and emotion to her role. Basically, I did fall asleep whilst watching this movie because it was taking ages to get to the point and I couldn't believe that they just let one of the sons go off on his own without any argument but it's worth a watch.Budget: $125million Worldwide Gross: $359.2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there epic movie about Noah trying to save earth from destruction. 4/10",Noah
61,TheMovieDiorama,Noah is flooded with artistic interpretation creating an inconsistent fantasy.,6,21 April 2019,"Aronofsky is a visual auteur. One for infamously producing evocative imagery to convey the very essence of humanity. For him to helm the retelling of possibly one of the most well-known biblical narratives, well, it was always going to be divisive. He does not settle for simplicity, and with that he turned a stormy apocalyptic tale into a brooding family drama that frequently swims in shallow storytelling waters rather than deep ambiguous oceans. Noah is gifted with visions depicting the destruction of the world by the hand's of God. He is tasked with building an ark that will house Earth's wildlife once the planet has been reset from humanity's sinful destruction.More often than not, people will give close-minded remarks such as ""Noah's Ark but with stupid rock monsters"". Whilst these golems do not necessarily make for a realistic interpretation, they do however shroud this story in a fantastical aura of prophecy and mysticism. Aronofsky takes the visualisation of Noah's tale and injects his own flair into it, by adding traits found in fantasy stories. Does it deter from the central story? Absolutely not. In fact I would be more inclined to state that it develops its themes even further. A barren wasteland covers the world due to humanity's neglect of God's creations (even if Aronofsky embeds scientific subtext within the religious readings). Deforestation, endlessly hunting wildlife to its extinction and the lust for omnipotence. The depiction of our own savagery is retained throughout, and makes for intriguing perspectives on creationism and the need for survival.Having said that, Aronofsky unfortunately succumbs to heavy-handed storytelling that unknowingly spoon feeds its themes to the audience. Whether it be Noah and his family reflecting on the sins of humanity, or Aronofsky cutting to an artistic stylised montage (containing hundreds of still framed shots) depicting destruction. It leaves no room for imagination, which ultimately is a step back for a director who often relishes in ambiguity. I also take issue with the narrative structure, most notably the third act. The first two acts satisfyingly retell the story of Noah's Ark, emitting visual splendour in every scene. Once the storm hits and the focus is on the characters of Noah and his family, the tone seemingly shifts to a psychological drama. The blurred line between visionary miracles and paranoid delusions is strangely explored through Aronofsky's trademark third act mental instability, and it doesn't work for this story. It's a jarring tonal shift that detracts from the biblical teachings that the story exhumes.Fortunately the performances from the main cast, especially Connelly and Crowe, were engaging enough to retain the pace during the third act. As someone who does not particularly find Winstone or Watson interesting, they both gave suitable performances even if the latter pretty much screamed her lines. The visual effects were delightful, the score was epic and the cinematography was frequently jaw-dropping.One could say that this was an unusual project for Aronofsky to helm, but upon reflection it strangely suited him. Despite the harsh narrative execution and misdirected third act, it's a refreshing interpretation of a classic tale that showcases Aronofsky's luminary artistic style. Whether you are an individual of faith or not, we can all agree that Noah is better than 'Evan Almighty'...",Noah
62,digitalbeachbum,Change the name and the title,1,25 April 2015,"This movie is a piecemeal of stories taken from a variety of religions. Do not expect your childhood Noah story. Think more of Lord of the Rings.Visually this is a good movie. The special effects and CG is really well done. I think they were inspired by Lord of the Rings because several scenes are very similar.The acting is fine and it is an all star cast. I'm disappointed that every one is caucasian.The script is hogwash if you try and compare it to just one religion. There is a ton of artistic license going on here with the director.Over all I can't wrap my brain around the name Noah and include it with a scaly dog, angels with rock bodies or mankind having industrial settlements with large pipes and other modern day advancements.I dislike too much to overcome the stuff I do like. 1/10 stars.

63,matthewssilverhammer,Calm down...it's actually pretty good,7,16 May 2014,"Noah mostly succeeds as a film, as an exciting Shakespearean melodramatic adventure tale. It barely touches on the animals and the ""Arky-Arky"" we all remember from Sunday school, instead focusing on the distinct characters. It follows Noah from birth all the way to days after the flood, with Aronofsky and Crowe nailing the disintegration of a man who has been given more than his fair share of responsibility. This is done with more auteur flair than we normally see a movie this size. The visions and dream sequences are notably gorgeous and even the action scenes have a great feel in coloring and camera work. As well, the sound and score are through the roof great, overloading your senses in this world. Other than some dubious CGI, the scope and majesty of the story is well-represented. Noah is an epic fantasy adventure, NOT a Biblical reenactment. To be enjoyed, one may need to set aside their Sunday school teachings, because this isn't the cute story you'll remember. It touches on the moral complexities inherent in a Creator God choosing to destroy His creation. It doesn't shy away from the horror of what this would bring. Really, where the controversy surrounding this big budget disaster exists is confounding. Sure there are some fleshing out of details and artistic licenses taken. However, self-sacrifice, unnerving faith, humanities faults, love and mercy conquering all, all of which people in Judeo-Christianity hold dear, are represented in spades. So while it's far from tight filmmaking, it is consistently unpredictable and much better than the controversy surrounding it.",Noah
64,l_rawjalaurence,"Starts Well, but Falls Apart as the Plot Unfolds",5,8 May 2014,"What to say about this movie that hasn't already been said before? In the first hour or so, director Darren Aronofsky sets up an intriguing premise: that the entire idea of the flood is God's revenge on humankind for having destroyed the world. There is a strong sense of contemporaneity about this message, especially when we consider issues such as global warming and environmentalism. As Noah, Russell Crowe comes across as a convincing servant of the Creator, someone charged with the responsibility of implementing His word, yet unable to exercise free will. Despite living a pious life, he has to preside over the destruction of a sinful world so that a New World might be created. Noah's dilemma is obvious, especially when we observe the way in which he is concerned for his family's future, even the wayward son Ham (Logan Lenman). As his grandfather Methuselah, Anthony Hopkins comes across as equally dedicated to the divine cause - despite living in comparative squalor, he finds enough to sustain himself in the earth, rather than having to rely on anyone. Once the flood occurs - in a stunning sequence of special effects - the film falls apart: director Aronofsky seems less interested in exploring the consequences of human action, and the ways in which it can traduce God's word, as seen, for instance in the relationship between Noah and his perpetual adversary Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone, a plausibly tooth-gnashing villain), and resorts instead to a family melodrama involving Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), his eldest son Shem (Douglas Booth) and adopted daughter Ila (Emma Watson). The two leading actresses give performances that can most charitably be described as undistinguished, devoid of light and shade. The film ends happily - for Noah's family, at least - with humankind re-assuming its position at the center of all activity. According to Hollywood logic, it seems that even the Creator has to take a supporting role.",Noah
65,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A grand and insightful interpretation of an ancient tale, if not a little strange",7,4 August 2014,"The story of God telling Noah to build an ark, all the animals coming aboard in twos, and then there being a great flood, has largely been deemed children's stuff. Given the last on-screen version of this story was the Steve Carell family film ""Evan Almighty,"" this stigma of biblical films has held true. That brings us to ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan"" filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's version.""Noah"" has long been a passion project for Aronofsky, who clearly saw something profoundly cinematic in this story and wanted desperately to challenge the cookie-cutter version told in Sunday schools all over the world. Indeed, Aronofsky has crafted a mature telling, one that creates a rich mythology around the biblical verses and stages a mighty battle for the redemption of humanity, with the essence of man's true nature at stake.The story imagines Noah (Russell Crowe) and the flood as the critical final chapter of a narrative arc that started with creation and included the expulsion from Eden, with humanity descending from two men: Cain, the one who killed his brother, and Seth. Noah and his family descend from Seth and are protectors of creation, but they are the last of his lineage, so ""The Creator"" sends Noah visions of a flood – and you know the rest. What you might not know, however, at least according to Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel, is that angels who were sympathetic toward man and defied The Creator were banished to Earth to live as rock monsters.The science-fiction/fantasy approach of ""Noah"" is reminiscent of Aronofsky's polarizing film ""The Fountain."" He crafts this world with the best of artistic intentions, but just in playing around with sensitive material, he walks the fine line between creativity and irreverence. ""Noah"" is best enjoyed when thought of as a creative, fantastical interpretation of what happened between the lines of the Old Testament.The main plot points of this story are quite well known, so creative interpretation is everything. ""Noah"" doesn't lack for creativity, but the various ""interpretive"" plot points drag things out on occasion, and in some cases get weird. The film's final act, after Noah and family board the ark – yes, after – evolves into a horror thriller of sorts and warps our perspective of the protagonist quite a bit. Aronofsky has expert intentions here that can be admired amid the strangeness of this shift in tone, but it may sour some folks.Even more radical are Noah's vision sequences and a scene that depicts the days of creation. You can see Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" roots here, his penchant for grotesque imagery that is bound to stay with you well after the movie. Although this merely adds artistic value to ""Noah,"" which would otherwise just be a biblical blockbuster, it is memorable.Although talented, the rest of the cast largely serves the purpose of expounding on Aronofsky's interpretation. Much of what happens to them serves as a side-plot exploration of the deeper ideas of mankind's nature. Ray Winstone as Tubal-Cain epitomizes our evil inclinations, for example, while Noah's son Ham (Logan Lerman) is the ""Luke Skywalker"" of the story, with everything hinging on which way he will lean.""Noah"" is a film of astounding visuals designed around philosophical ideas. As such, it's entertaining to watch and ripe for discussion, but the story operates almost exclusively to make these thematic points rather than to provide the most enjoyable narrative possible. At the same time, working within the confines of a story thousands of years old, Aronofsky and co. undoubtedly bring something new to Noah and the ark that brings its message into a mature, modern context.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

66,Vartiainen,Grand ideas that just miss the bullseye,5,13 November 2014,"Darren Aronofsky's attempt to adapt an age old biblical story to modern silver screen is certainly full of his own style and ideas. Everything from the grand birth of the universe to gorgeous visuals to the fragility of human kindness and nature.The thing about Aronofsky is that either you like him or you don't. And I've always been in the latter camp. I certainly don't hate him, don't get me wrong, but he has this style of telling stories that always smells slightly pretentious to me. The same here. An interesting take on the story certainly, delving much more deeply into Noah's psyche, showing the strain of the unbearable burden he has been entrusted. And I absolutely love the world of the ancient world where unfamiliar creatures roam the Earth, man is much closer to his roots and even the sky, the universe, is different. But then there are the ""bad guys"" and the other monsters that completely pull you away from the biblical feel. As said, it's a stylistic choice, and thus not an outright flaw, but it kept the movie from opening up to me.That being said, it's still absolutely worth seeing for those good parts. And there are many of them from the visuals to the story to the actors and the whole scope of it. Noah stays faithful to the spirit of the tale while going much deeper and imagining what it must have been like to actually live in those times.",Noah
67,Turfseer,Aronofsky's rock monsters can't turn this antediluvian and post-antediluvian potboiler into compelling drama,4,6 April 2014,"My question about 'Noah', Darren Aronofsky's bloated, CGI-effects laden Biblical epic, is whether it was worth making at all. The tale found in the Bible doesn't exactly lend itself to good drama. It's a simple tale that's actually taken from an earlier story from Mesopotamia. You all know the story: Patriarch saves all the creatures on earth (in pairs of two) by building an ark after God (known as the 'Creator' here) decides to destroy all of humanity, after they turn inexorably wicked.Russell Crowe can't be blamed much for another one of his grim-faced, ultra-serious performances (much like his dull 'Robin Hood'), since he's simply been directed to follow Aronofsky's (for the most part), dull script. Before Aronofsky serves up his version of the building of the Ark and subsequent flood, he introduces a human antagonist in the form of one Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) who is quite conveniently a descendant of Cain (all-time bad guy who killed good old brother Abel). Winstone actually is much more lively than Crowe as 'king' of the desolate realm he rules over. He gets wind of the Ark and God's plan to wipe out everyone, so he plans to kill Noah and take over his ship.The problem is how does Noah and his family defend himself against an entire Army? Aronofsky's 'brilliant' idea is to conceive of a coterie of fallen angels, 'The Watchers', who also happen to be rock monsters. You'll recall that the enjoyable sci-fi dramedy, 'Galaxy Quest', also featured a much more malevolent rock monster. But here, Aronofsky's monsters are much more benign—and are willing to defend the Ark from Tubal-cain's bad guy minions. If there's one thing that really ruins 'Noah', it's the presence of the ridiculous rock monsters, that reduces the film to feeling like one of those old, cheesy episodes, from the original Star Trek series or a clunky Transformers-like fest.If you're expecting some great flood scenes, with the Ark being tossed about in a turbulent sea, you will be disappointed. Noah and family are tossed about for a few seconds and the creature passengers remain undisturbed, as they enjoy their bucolic sleep. I'm sad to report that the storm (as storms go), ranks way below iconic disaster scenes, such as the twister in 'The Wizard of Oz'. Instead, Noah gets to duke it out with Tubal-cain, who manages to be the only one of his army, to slip on board the ark.Meanwhile, Aronofsky opts for melodrama to compensate for his lack of a good 'Poseiden Adventure' involving the Ark. Ila (Emma Watson), adopted by the family early on, suddenly finds she's 'with child' as a result of grandfather Methuselah's transcendent intervention (Anthony Hopkins has the only comic scene in the entire movie, with his successful quest to dine on a clump of delicious berries!). While Noah probably will get some great marks from animal activists, on the other hand, I have to no doubt he will receive failing marks from those concerned with female empowerment. Yes, religious zealot Noah actually has the idea that God wants him to murder Ila's twin newborns, to ensure that all mankind is punished for their transgressions. While he's trying to decide should he or shouldn't he (i.e. kill the babies), the character's likability factor goes down considerably (yes I know this is Biblical times, but it's hard to like a character who comes within one second of committing infanticide). What's more our modern sensibilities are offended when the womenfolk give him hugs afterward—it's hard to stomach the idea that Noah is forgiven so easily.That's about it folks. When all is said and done, 'Noah' is kind of a bore. On the positive side, there's some occasional good cinematography, including a nifty scene where Noah gazes upon Tubal-cain's tribe, as they do their 'Hieronymus Bosch' impersonation. Ultimately Mr. Aronofsky does not possess a creative enough spark to turn this antediluvian and post-antediluvian potboiler into compelling drama. We're stuck with clichéd battles attended by absurd rock monsters and a cringeworthy protagonist who spends a good deal of time contemplating the murder of his grandchildren. Time to get out my old copy of 'Ben Hur'—chariot racing seems a lot more exciting than both humans and animals getting tossed around in the hold of a ship, on a storm-tossed sea.",Noah

69,generationofswine,An Honest Review,5,21 April 2017,"I feel obligated to watch and review movies like this. I am just happy as a clam that they make movies based on real life or mythological things simply because it gets people interested in it.I mean, I'm a historian...one that has spent his life walking that fine line between history, geology, and a Catholic faith...They never agree.Don't worry, I don't care about how historically accurate movies are and being a historian I play lip service to the presumed accuracy of my religion....And as someone with a deep understanding of geology, when it comes to even 5,000 years ago I play lip service to my own profession.I think it's hysterical that people are hating on this film for religious reasons. ""Noah"" is largely Biblically inaccurate, which is even funnier than usual given that every Priest I've ever had recognizes Noah as Gilgamesh.So to hate it on a religious stance is idiotic to begin with...and to hate a totally religiously inaccurate film simply because it's based on a tale from the Abrahamic Holy books is as idiotic because, well, it's not even accurate to those.So we'll erase all the Religious and history crap now and just look at the movie.If you didn't see this in the theater and if you don't have a, well, an Ark sized TV...it might not be worth it.The main selling point is really watching the Great Flood, the Deluge is sort of why people like me want to see it...and we want to see it BIG. HUGE. ENORMOUS.So...a small screen and you might as well be watching abrupt History Channel ""The Bible"" miniseries...and just leave it at that.In fact, you may be better off passing if you don't watch it big...because without the enormity of the flood on the enormous screen you are left with Russell Crowe and that just hurts.Yup...Russell Crowe. What you have here, minus the flood (which is the star of the show) is Crowe, a man that is so convinced that he is God's gift to acting that he totally forgot how to do it.I don't care how you feel about religion (as long as you tolerate all of them) and I don't care how you feel about accuracy in film...no matter your feelings you have to endure Crowe.If you can do that more power to you.But then you have Jennifer Connelly and yeah, you may think she's still eye candy--and you would be right--but that doesn't change the fact that she still can't emote.Thankfully you have Watson, who manages to out act both of them...and Hopkins if he really had a role in all of this worth his skills.So if you have the means to watch it big...the flood is worth the price of admission...if you don't beware of the Crowe.",Noah
70,freemantle_uk,"From a non-religious person, Noah is excellent",10,8 April 2014,"Films about Biblical stories and religious themes have for many years had a bad name, either being cheap and preachy or very controversial like Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. But finally we have received a thoughtful, intelligent film with Christian themes thanks to Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky.On the first day God created Heaven and Earth and he later made man in his own image. But his creation, Adam and Eve end up corrupted and with their sons Abel, Cain and Seth are banished from the Garden of Eden. After Cain kills Abel his descendants spread, build cities, become more corrupted and sprit and pillage the land. Seth's descendants try to protect God's creation, but only one branch of the family is left, Noah (Russell Crowe), his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and their three sons and adopted daughter.Noah and his family live a nomadic lifestyle away from humanity. Man has turned the world into a barren wasteland. Noah has visions of a coming flood and interprets them as the Creator wanting him to save the innocent, the animals because they still live like they did in the Garden of Eden. With the help of The Watchers, fallen angels turned to stone for defying God for helping man, they build the Ark. But the king of men, Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) wants the Ark for himself and prepares for battle to take it.Noah is Aronofsky's biggest scale movie to date and it is allows for epic entertainment whilst allowing an auteur like him to keep his artistic integrity. Aronofsky provides plenty of food for thought as he does not bring us a stereotypical preachy film that only appeals to the converted. Noah is an Old Testament tale, not the children's version of the story as God is a cruder, vengeful being who keeps his distance and the visions have to be interpreted. The men of Tubal-Cain are crude, savage people as they are violent, tearing animals apart for meat and selling women into slavery as they strip the land.Noah takes a philosophical approach as characters debate the morality of man, that even the Seth's descendants are the product of original sin and whether they should suffer God's wrath as well as Cain's descendants. There are questions about whether there are good and innocent people in Tubal-Cain's tribe and Noah and his middle son Ham (Logan Lerman) both have doubts as during their missions: Noah towards the Creator and Ham towards his father. Tubal-Cain himself acts as a form of temptation for Ham like the snake for Eve. Noah is a man who descends into madness as he becomes blinded by his mission in the third act. This is a more complex view of religion and God's will than in movies like God's Not Dead which is as subtle as a sledgehammer and only has one viewpoint.Besides the obvious religious themes Noah also tackles environmentalism as man recklessly mines and rips the land, stripping it bare for resources, killing any struggling animal for meat and leaving nothing but ash. The use of Iceland as a superb location illustrates this world of humanity living on the edge, toiling to survive. Noah works as a metaphor for now about how people treat nature as we look for resources and kill plants and animals regardless of the consequences.Aronofsky reunites with his regular collaborators Matthew Libatique and Clint Mansell and both men continue to do excellent work for the director. Libatique easily moves up to epic cinematography, showing the large scale of the empty decaying world and the forest created by Noah as well as inventive shots with silhouettes and time lapse photography. Mansell continues to supply excellent music and provides an epic score.Aronofsky easily steps up to large scale production, giving us a large battle in the middle of the film, moments of violence and works well with CGI, mixing it with the large set for the Ark. Aronofsky gives us some beautiful visuals, with the angels having a golden glow, visions of the Garden of Eden and the Watchers have a classic slow-mo look to them as they move with a jerky motion.Noah is not a film for everyone as the fundamental audiences of both the religious and atheist will dismiss the film as propaganda for and against religion, but it is a film that fans of Aronofsky will enjoy and it is a great addition to his filmography.Noah is not only Russell Crowe's second film about religious redemption and punishment, it is also his second film he gets to sing. Fortunately for our ears he only sings one lullaby this time round.",Noah

Joe, Ninja Fighter",3,22 August 2014,"After his portrayal of Noah (for only $30 million), I'm guessing that playing ""God"", himself, will be Russell Crowe's next fabulous venture on the big screen.And, you can be sure that if everyone talked real nice-n-sweet to Crowe (and royally kissed his pudgy, mega-star ass) he'd probably be more than willing to give us his best (or his worst) ""God"" impersonation for no more than, say, a flat-rate of $50 million.... And, hey, at that price wouldn't you say that it was a helluva heavenly, Hollywood deal!!?? Anyways - To say that this $125 million production (which, I guess, was supposed to be looked upon as a blessed gift from God) was absolutely awful would most certainly be one of the biggest understatements of the past decade.After seriously viewing Noah, I'm totally astounded by the size of the movie-industry's balls to have the gall, and the arrogance, and the shameless hypocrisy to dare to tackle (in this day and age) one of the most ridiculously absurd (and fairy-tale-like) Bible stories of them all.Had a reasonably interesting and marginally intelligent story resulted from this badly-conceived, out-of-sync undertaking, then, yes, I would have gladly given Noah my all-out enthusiastic praise and approval. But, as this film stood, I had no choice, but to view it as an even bigger mess of irreligious incoherency than I had originally thought possible.Yep. This picture has got to be one of the most god-awful Bible stories ever told. I can't imagine how the hell Paramount Pictures was ever conned into the foolish agreement of actually financing this religiously righteous rubbish.To a thinking, rational-minded adult, this particular tale of Noah was about as believable as the likes of Santa Claus (and it was far less intriguing, in the long run).I'm completely convinced that the producers of this film are clearly nothing but outright Christian-haters. And driven by the greed of the almighty dollar, their sole purpose for making Noah was to devilishly lure people-of-faith into the movie theatres (all across the continent, and beyond) and gleefully rob these gullible-ones of their hard-earned money.And, finally - I think that it's really hilarious that Noah completely missed the mark and that out of receiving over 110,000 votes on IMDb, this film (that praises vegan-ism and condemns meat eaters) had an average rating of only 6 stars out of 10.",Noah
72,dfranzen70,More than just a lot of water.,8,30 July 2014,"Despite a familiar story, Darren Aronofsky's Noah is dramatically compelling and visually staggering, featuring solid performances that are outdone by the special effects, particularly the excess of water. Even with a big budget, Aronofsky doesn't ignore the importance of plot development and deftly avoids painting his characters as either Good or Bad.The story begins with Noah (Russell Crowe) seeing his father Lamech (Martin Csokas) murdered by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone). Tubal-cain is a descendant of Cain, who killed his brother Abel and fled east; Noah is a direct descendant of Seth, also brother to Cain. Noah, unseen by Tubal-cain, escapes; he later marries Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), and they have three boys: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Noah begins to have visions of the end of the world, and when he sees a flower grow where no seed could previously find purchase, he becomes convinced that his Creator (God is never mentioned in the movie) has decided to destroy Man but has chosen to spare Noah and his family - and the innocent creatures of nature. Thus the family, with orphan Ila (Emma Watson) in tow, joins forces with The Watchers - fallen angels turned to anthropomorphic rock - to build an ark to survive a deluge that will wipe out the rest of mankind.But this is not merely a conflict of man versus the elements. Noah believes he's been chosen to facilitate the extermination of all mankind, so he tells his family that after the storm, his sons are to bury him and Naameh and then kill themselves. Complicating this further is Ila, who forces Noah into a terrifying dilemma. Noah, in Aronofsky's view, is by no means a hero. He is, however, quite human and prey to self-doubt and misinterpretation of his Creator's wishes. Should all mankind be eradicated, allowing the plants and animals full domain over the planet? The conflict is handled quite nimbly thanks to the usual strong portrayal by Crowe. Watson and Connelly offer strong support, Connelly particularly indomitable. Maybe having Tubal-cain as an additional antagonist was overkill, but what Aronofsky really focuses on is the family quarrels between Noah and Naameh, Noah and Ham, Noah and Shem, Noah and Ila, and Noah and himself. The family may survive the great flood, but their actions lead to some agonizing decisions and situations.So Aronofsky chooses to use these internal conflicts as the impetus for the movie rather than go by the traditional Biblical story. That is, the story is more or less intact, but it's often secondary to how Noah deals with his kin. This makes Noah not just a huge spectacle to wow even the least devout but also a deep psychological journey, similar to Aronofsky's earlier works.",Noah

He convinces his family to help him with steps to save nature but they will appeal to him through the entire process to let humans be in the new world too...but Noah will do whatever is necessary to make sure that doesn't happen.

The storyline for this is very interesting and entertaining regardless of the artistic liberties taken. The voice of god elements was at the center of everything about this movie. The CGI scenes were fun to watch but not overly good, maybe a bit too much. The cast was excellent, especially Crowe. His intensity was felt throughout the film. The flood itself was just okay but the people trying to survive after the flood was well done. The intensity, as previously referenced, was so good the entire movie through the very final scene.

It's based on the famous biblical story about God giving one man, Noah, a mission; to build an ark-a big boat-and populate it with two of each kind of animal to repopulate the Earth after God destroys it with a forty day flood. The reasoning was that mankind had gotten too evil and greedy and the Earth had to be cleansed, to start all over. When I said it was weird, it's like it's a sci-fi adaptation. Angels that have been banished from Heaven to the Earth are made to look like they are made out of rocks-I don't know why but they looked kind of like prehistoric Transformers, maybe it was the way they moved. There are animals, such as dogs or maybe they were coyotes, that had scales on their bodies. Russell plays Noah, a man that wants to follow God's will to the letter, which gets a little into a religious quandary about killing when his adopted daughter, Emma, is pregnant and Russell wants to kill the babies, if they are female-I don't remember that from my Sunday school lessons, but it has been a long time. Jennifer plays Russell's wife and Anthony plays Methuselah, Russell's father. Ray plays a man that leads a group of people that want to take the ark from Russell- he is also a direct descendant of Cain, whereas Russell is from the Able side of the family. It's directed by Darren Aronofsky-Black Swan, The Wrestler, The Fountain-and the effects are good but it was just a little on the weird side. I just don't know who the target audience is because religious groups will probably not like the interpretation and be offended, while the sci-fi crowd will probably think it's more religious than it actually is, and not even go to see it. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Noah
75,runamokprods,"Grew considerably on a second viewing, even if it still seemed flawed.",8,26 October 2016,"This surprised me by growing considerably in my estimation on a second viewing. -- a second viewing I almost didn't like it enough the first time around to even give it. (Although I've found almost all of Aronofsky's films have grown on me with time and re-visiting.)Russell Crowe's tortured performance of Noah as half prophet, half madman felt more honest, affecting and deeper seeing it again. A lot of the family drama that felt a bit forced on first try, was moving and involving on the second. In particular, there's a deeply moving and memorable 'human' scene, when Jennifer Connolly finally stands up to Noah's determination to wipe out mankind. Her emotional power and fury overwhelm even Noah's (and Crowe's) strength.That said, many of the film's best bits are it's visions and 'non-plot' sections, as when Noah tells his children the story of genesis while we watch a super speeded up flow of the evolution of the universe, then earth, and then life evolving, finding a sort of connection between Darwin, science, and still having a spiritual feeling about the world. Powerful too, the few second montage of man going from ape to 20th century man in silhouette, while showing his violence in each step, just a few frames long.On the other hand, there are still – for me – sizable flaws, from annoying lapses in logic (some the fault of the original story, not just Aronofsky Like, if there are only 2 of each animal, how did we avoid a world of doomed inbreeding?). And there are forced 'Hollywood' plot twists. Like the villainous stowaway on the arc who also just happens to be Noah's mortal enemy and the man who killed his father.There's no denying that Aronofsky is bold, intelligent, and capable of being a visionary film- maker, even if he can be infuriatingly uneven, and fall prey at key moments to being showy rather than deep. It's why I always look forward to seeing his films, and feel they are due a second viewing.",Noah
76,XweAponX,"Most unfairly panned movie, ever.",10,20 August 2014,"The reactions I have read here are why there is a flood story in The Bible in the first place.I'll assume the most adverse reactions to this film came from the Conservative Christian corner, because ""This is not told exactly how it was told in the Bible"". I don't hold my own Faith as conservative in any form. How Big is God? The one I believe in is larger than the box that many people try to stuff Him into. The Biblical idea of God is not a conservative idea, in fact it is the most Liberal of all ideas, and a Liberating idea as well, more so than any concept we Humans struggle with and argue about.The Biblical version of this story is also lacking quite a few details. So when we read it in that awesome book, we still have to fill in the blanks with our imagination.That's what this film does, without stepping on whatever belief systems we have. The Bible tells us that there were a race of Giants, the Offspring of Angels that had come to earth who ""knew"" the daughters of men. Biblically, that was the population which The Great Flood was supposed to have removed. In this story, that coupling of 'Daughters of Men' and 'Sons of God' was not shown or referred to.Instead, we had the Angels who had fallen to Earth, both as helpers and antagonists- Which this film calls ""The Watchers"" - This is where the Biblical story is ""Fictionalized"" - Or, more fictionalized, if you believe that the story of the Flood is fiction in the first place. I have always believed that The Flood happened in some form. Actually, they used things from The Books of Enoch, which were valid books of the bible before the Council/Huge Argument Session of Nicea, where MEN decided which books God actually inspired.As far as The Mechanics of the Flood, the Bible states that ""The Fountains of the Deep Broke Up"" - This film shows that titanic event happening, which no other film about The Flood has shown. That alone made this movie worthwhile for me, because we can only imagine the level of destruction - Nobody who was there survived to ever talk about it or describe it, and Noah never saw it while secluded in The Ark. Maybe Tubal-Cain did while hanging on to the outside of The Ark, but his little side-story did not traditionally happen that way.The Noah in this film played by Russell Crowe is a very ""Jonahish"" Noah, one who is upset because God did not totally wipe out everybody, just like Jonah complained when Ninevah was not wiped out. Noah tries to finish the job himself, in other words he had the gall to think he could speak and act for God, when God had other plans with Ila.These details probably are what upset the Bible and religious Purists, but the way I saw it, was that Noah and his family were simply Human, and Noah himself was capable of the same evil as Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone). The point never is that all men can be as evil as Tubal-Cain, but that all men can choose not to be. There is also a kind of Messianic thing happening with ""Ila"" (Emma Watson) being impregnated. Anthony Hopkins' ""Methuselah"" takes on an Enoch-Like character (Enoch being the only human which God personally took off Earth).The Imagery of this film is very fantastic, showing an Earth overrun with Cain's descendants. It could have been a very mechanized population, or scientifically advanced- If you believe in the idea of a flood, then you can also believe in the possibility of a highly advanced civilization. If the Flood story is true, then there would be no archaeological evidence of any previous civilization.So when Noah recounts the story of creation and of mankind, the creation story is shown in a more scientific way and the development of mankind's warring nature seemed to follow our own history.Even if you don't agree with the liberties taken with the traditional Flood story, there is enough in here for any Christian, Hebrew, Muslim, Bhuddist, or Athiest to enjoy.And when it comes down to it, the story which The Bible recounts was handed down on pieces of parchment from age after age to generation after generation. The main gist of the story? God was upset how Man turned out, wanted to destroy mankind, chose one man Noah to shepherd the animals to the new Earth, and finally repenting his vow of Destruction (ie, Rainbow) and a new vow of ""never again"" - It's all there, so what are you arguing about?There are two scenes which I find interesting. Noah's father Lamech (The incredible character Actor Marton Csokas) was giving Noah his Inheritance- the skin of the Serpent - when he is killed by Tubal-Cain who takes it away. In the end, Noah gets the skin back and then gives it to his Family. Even though this is a story that is never told in the Bible, it represents our true inheritance: That all of us have to choose to be good.",Noah
77,alindsay-al,A great telling of this much discussed religious tale,8,15 April 2014,"This is one of the most controversial films I have seen in some time with the battle between the religious beliefs and the licence taken for this film that has sparked much conversation. This film is great in my opinion possibly because I am not religious and I just wanted to see a great film and with everything involved I believe that this is exactly what I got. This film shows Noah foreshadowing the flood that will kill all of humanity and wash away their sins and starts to build the ark so he, his family and all the animals can survive. In my opinion all the performances were great including Russell Crowe, Ray Winston and Emma Watson in their respective roles that all help make this film feel more than just a religious film. This film surprisingly feels epic with battles between the villains and the rock creatures and the fights between Noah and Cain being quite brutal. Now I do believe that this film will offend a lot of people but when I watch a film I look at the film as a film not as how the religious significance alters the story wise. My main negative for this film is that it feels longer than it is and feels too slow at points but it definitely makes up for this with its cool action scenes, intense character moments and dark scenes. Noah is a great film based on a religious tale.",Noah
78,estebangonzalez10,"A bigger Aronfosky production, but a similar idea",6,5 April 2014,"""My father said that one day, if man continued in his ways, the Creator would annihilate this world.""The trailers and the first half of Noah made me believe this was going to be a very different Darren Aronofsky film. Mostly known for his independent work as an art house director he centers his films on characters with strong obsessions that tend to lead them towards some form of self destruction. The first half of this film however has an epic tone with fantastic visual effects and a big scale production unlike what we've seem in his past films. That firs half reminded me a lot of other epic fantasy films like The Lord of the Rings. However midway through the film Aronofsky switches gears on us and returns to the themes he is known for. He centers the story around the psychological struggles Noah is going through and how his obsessive behavior begins leading him to self destruction. Kind of like what he did with the main characters in Black Swan and The Wrestler, Aronofsky tries to delve deep into the psyches of Noah and the delusions he might have been tormented by for the task he was given. This is Aronofsky's film and it is very loosely based on the Bible (Noah's story only has four short chapters in Genesis). Christians will be disappointed if they go into this expecting a film based on a biblical perspective, because Aronofsky takes many artistic liberties and creates a tormented and flawed character similar to the ones he's made in his past films. What he does different with Noah is that he begins telling the film on an epic scale and then he reduces it to a personal story centering on Noah and the struggles he faces with his family. The visuals are great and the performances are strong, but the film feels too long and it oversimplifies environmentalism to make the story relatable to modern audiences. One could even argue that Aronfosky wasn't telling a story of the past, but presenting a futuristic apocalyptic tale. Having read the story of Noah in Genesis I must say that this film isn't really an adaptation but more of an original screenplay written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel (who also wrote The Fountain and has produced three other Aronofsky films). The story introduces us to Noah (Russell Crowe) and his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) who live with their three sons: Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll). They are the only descendants of Seth that remain, the rest of the world has become wicked and disrespectful towards nature and the Creator. In a dream Noah sees water covering the Earth, and in order to understand this strange message from the Creator he visits his grandfather, Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins), who is still alive. Along the way he discovers several dead humans who have been attacked, but their is a young girl named Ila (Emma Watson) who has survived and he decides to help her and take her with him. After meeting with his grandfather, Noah understands his calling and begins building a giant ark to make space for his family and a pair of animals of every species in order to preserve creation. He encounters difficulties along the way as a group of men led by Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) defy him, but Noah has the protection of Watchers (fallen angels who've taken the form of giant stone-like creatures). The flood is coming and Noah will stop at nothing to execute the Creator's plan.Noah has some breathtaking scenes that work really well for an epic film like this. My favorites were the montage where Noah explains how the world has been created and the scene where he plants a seed and a spring of water comes out from Earth extending into an entire forest in a matter of seconds. The scenes involving the flood were also pretty well made. The scenery and cinematography is captured gorgeously. I also enjoyed the performances from Crowe, Watson, and Winstone. However, Noah is the only character that has depth as the rest of the cast play stereotypical characters that don't offer much to the story. The film centers on Noah's inner struggle and how he deals with the task given to him as he becomes obsessed and self destructive after seeing the wickedness of mankind. The film does become a bit heavy handed with the ecological message although it certainly simplifies it at times because what Aronofsky is really interested in exploring is the character of Noah. This might be his most ambitious film to date, but I still prefer his smaller films. The Wrestler continues to be my favorite film of his, although I still haven't seen Pi or The Fountain.",Noah

With very slow screenplay and some unconvincing scenes the movie is more disappointing then ever.Let's not get into the argument if this is a real story of Noah and let's just concentrate on the movie, plot of the movie is surely convincing and had the ability to be turned into a great movie but the execution of the movie is a big let down.The acting is superb and with some of the greatest talent like Russell Crowe, Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone and Jennifer Connelly the acting department was the best of them all, Emma Watson also surprised by her acting skills.Screenplay of the movie is very slow and as per me this is the main reason for any movie to get successful and in the case of Noah screenplay is a big let down. We have seen movies with the length of close to three hours, three hours and infact more then three hours but crisp and tight screenplay make you engaged to the movie but in the case of this movie 2.18 hours looked very long. Music and background music of the movie is good.Climax of the movie is good but somewhat illogical and slow, most of the viewers might have exhausted till the movie reaches to it's climax.

81,davispittman,Well made adaptation of the Bible story,8,23 April 2017,"Believers BEWARE!!!! I'm gonna be perfectly honest and blunt: deeply devout Christians will not like this film, they just won't. And it's not because it's a poorly made movie, it's not because the acting is bad or the effects are bad, it's because it's not true to the Bible at all. Now to me it makes absolutely no difference whether the movie is true to its source material since I'm not a religious person and I'm just looking for an entertaining well put together fictional story. And that is precisely what I got. And I've actually heard from Christians talking about the movie that Hollywood had to take leaps and fill in the gaps somehow because the story of Noah is so short in the Bible. It probably would've been pretty boring too if they only would've stuck to the Bible. The thing that I love the most about this movie is the performances! Jennifer Connelly is the best in the film, I mean WOW, I was blown away by her powerful performance, there is one scene in particular where her dramatic acting chops are really shown. Crowe is a good Noah, a lot of times his character is just very blank looking and almost in a trans because he must ""follow the creator"", but Russel plays it well. I adored Emma Watson in her role, this movie really showed how talented an actress she really is. And lastly Logan Lerman is very mature and you can see how he's growing as an actor here. The story is very interesting and I was so curious and invested the whole way through. I loved the liberties Darren took, like with ""the watchers"". The movie has a well written script too. All in all it's an interesting film that I do recommend but to all deeply religious Christians out there: you probably won't like it. 8/10.",Noah

83,3xHCCH,Absurdly Un-Biblical,2,8 June 2014,"Writer and director Darren Aronofsky gives us his own interpretation of the familiar Biblical tale of Noah and his Ark. Whatever underlying message he has behind this very odd and unconventional version, I confess I can only guess at, and I do not like my interpretation of what Aronofsky is trying to say. I think his artistic imagination went too far for a story that many people have a definite idea for since childhood.There was Noah (Russell Crowe), his wife (Jennifer Connely) and his three sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japheth. There was an ark and a flood. That is what they show in the trailer, which indeed looked good. But when you see the actual film, that is all that what this film has got in common with the Bible. Everything else that stretched this film to more than two hours is all from the dark imagination of Darren Aronofsky.There were scenes of supernatural magic, but not from God. They were care of the grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) who can cause an entire barren valley to become a lush forest with a river all from one single seed. He can also cause a barren woman to again have the capacity to bear children, with his mere touch. But that is not the oddest thing about this film.My vote for the most absurd idea and imagery would have to be those robotic giants made of stone called The Watchers. They were supposed to be the fallen angels, whose only ""sin"" was wanting to help man. They were the ones who help Noah build his ark. This idea is heretical to the core. But even without going into religious beliefs, their presence in this type of film is ridiculous.I do not get the look and costumes that Noah and the other characters were made to sport. There is a dystopian futuristic vibe going on that is hard to take, since this is supposed to be about the ancient past. Particularly with the villain character Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) you certainly feel that he lost his way into this film from the set of ""Mad Max"" or ""Waterworld"" with his leather duds and hairstyle.The cast of actors looked excellent on paper, but unfortunately, they were all overacting to the hilt here. Russell Crowe portrayed Noah with his signature grit and passion. However, his Noah felt like a mad man, even giving off a psychotic killer vibe in parts. A role was created to accommodate Emma Watson as Shem's wife who will test Noah's will in the end, but she was made to act so whiny and annoying. Jennifer Connely and Anthony Hopkins seem to bring anything outstanding to their performances. Logan Lerman at least manages to give us something interesting with his rebellious middle-child character.The only part of the film I really liked was when Noah recalled the story of Creation. The montage of imagery Aronofsky conjured up was magical. It evokes memories of Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" imagery, but more accessible. For that magical sequence alone do I award this film another star.As a whole, I did not like this movie. If the intention was being artistic, it did not feel like a good art film. If you think too much into the nebulous references within the story, you may get the feeling that this film is sending negative messages about the Creator. It was too long, boring and pretentious for regular movie audiences. Watch at your own risk.",Noah
84,aharmas,Literally Transforming Noah,9,30 March 2014,"Once upon a time there were these very special soldiers (angels), and through the will of God and the disobedience of mankind, they ended up crashing onto Earth and transforming themselves into these doomed creatures. If you have read this, you're probably wonder if I'm discussing a Michael Bay film... It does recall a few Science Fiction ""classics"" of the last two decades, but it's really part of the new adaptation of the Biblical story, and by the end these beings are transformed ""again"", you have to admit that this little side story does make sense.Lifted from being just a plain action movie, with a Hollywood twist, we are treated to a film that benefits grandly from the very good work of Connely and Crowe. Yes, they both portray the hero and his wife, with way more depth than these characters ever showed. In fact, Connely does outstanding work as the woman who expresses clearly what might be wrong with the entire enterprise and never wavers about where her loyalties are, except when Noah's faith begins taking some very strange turns.There are amazing visual all along the way, and having the exotic backgrounds of Iceland, I believe help enormously, but there is magic in the photography and beauty in the stark lands that Noah transforms into his workshop. Soon, we are given the background and how the ark was built, how the animals managed not to devour each other, and how in the world the hordes of humans couldn't get a ticket into the ark.In fact, the film moves quite well for its length, and somehow the talky sections don't drag at all. I remember when the same director took on the metaphysical ""The Fountain"" only to make a terrific concept go pretty bad. Visually stunning, it didn't satisfy anyone because we were lost from the very first frames. It helps to have a bit of an idea of what ""Noah"" is about, but it also requires surrendering to the imagination of a craftsman that needed to provide us with a longer, more developed and imaginary creation.Finally, there is plenty of the necessary ingredients to make the film succeed. There is a good story, interesting and exciting characters that don't just stand there and let the world literally collapse around them. Yes, it's the end of the world, but humanity can rest assured that with people like these, there's bound to be a future, and it certainly doesn't help that we have warriors like those angels, who are pretty handy in more than one occasion, and the ever reliable Hopkins is more than a welcome presence here.",Noah
85,peterp-450-298716,I wonder what's so bad about this movie ....,6,15 November 2014,"I really wonder what's so terribly bad about this movie.Granted,it smells a bit like commercializing the book of all books (And I think this still is the most ingenious elaborated marketing plan ever devised in human history.This plan made sure a book was written that will dominate the list of bestsellers in perpetuity.Probably until the end of the world ...) in compliance with all film adaptations of other literature.After ""The Lord of the Rings"",""Harry Potter"",""The Hunger Games"" and other similar books susceptible to commercialization,it seems like Hollywood has found a Biblical gap in the market.End of this year Christian Bale will be wandering through the bone-dry desert like Moses in ""Exodus"".Darren Aronofsky's religious story ""Noah"" is of a moister content,with Russell Crowe hammering together a huge boat,so he can defy the salt water together with his offspring and all species living on earth,except for the water creatures,because they feel comfortable in this huge bathtub.But isn't it so that it should be freshwater instead of saltwater with all that rain ?And aren't there two types of aquatic animals?Those who survive in saltwater and the others? How was this crucial problem tackled ? Anyway,despite the practical issues,this was a highly entertaining spectacle with an abundance of special effects and water (They used about 83,000 liters water in this film.A quantity that would make the average Ethiopian farmer really jealous ... ).You could expect the Christian community not being happy about the making of this film. Isn't it sacrilegious to turn this pious story into a mega spectacle and create it like contemporary fantasy films?I suggest they redesign the interior and decoration of churches,so that it would be a reflection of this rather epic-looking film.There's a high probability that one could reach a new fan base and the population of the group of churchgoers could grow again.I have no idea if this version of ""Noah"" follows the original story faithfully.The only thing I knew about it,was that an ark full of animals,which drifted on an immense ocean,played a major role.I don't know if the family troubles as presented here,correspond to the biblical story.It would be just a simple,short film if Aronofsky remained faithful to the biblical version,because that story about the adventures of Noah is not that big of a deal.And that's probably the Christian audience's key problem.The whole story is firmly filled up with profound special effects and great battles.A bold yet extremely successful choice was the introduction of ""The Watchers"".A collection of fallen angels who mutated into rocky beings.The comparison with ""The Lord of the Rings"" is made quickly.In particular,the movement of The Watchers is very similar to the way ""The Ents"" moved.Difficult and slow but at the same time,they can strike in a devastating way.The moment these rocks start to protect the Noah family against the onrushing crowd,with a fair part of the crowd being violently crushed and spinning through the air after a massive hit with their blocky fists,you could easily compare it with the attack on Minas Tirith.Also the Ark is visually excellent developed.An apparently gigantic freighter with an entire zoo on board.Beautiful images and realistic created animals.Even the devastating flood was successful shown and was less fake as the one in ""Evan Almighty"".Maybe it was the acting?Honestly I can't say anything wrong about that either.OK,Russell Crowe doesn't really look like a devout man and the way he declares biblical phrases,seemed like a market vendor who tries to sell fake products convincingly.And yet he did it properly and the matter of conscience he was struggling with in the end,was sublimely interpreted.Only the emerging fanaticism started to bother me.But ultimately this is a tedious facet that's part of a religion.Although Jennifer Connelly,Naameh the wife of Noah,was limited seen in the picture and didn't play such a big part in the whole set-up,she was still the driving force that propelled Noah in the right direction. Anthony Hopkins,the helpful grandfather Methuselah who yearns for berries impressed me.And Ray Winstone as the warlike king Tubal-Cain, represented evil.The rest of the cast was necessary,but not particularly memorable.""Noah"" turned out to be an average disaster movie with a serious family conflict which could eventually become a family drama.Maybe it wasn't quite literally as written in the Bible,but in the end it was not sacrilege. And there is certainly no profanity.Maybe Christian representatives could be a little less narrow-minded and give this interpretation some credit.Eventually the sequence Aronofsky used for the creation of the Earth is also just a guess.No living soul can conclusively prove that this is the ultimate truth.Indeed,it's not a film where a funny giraffe and roguish elephant cosily sit alongside each other and look over the railing to the rising water.It's rather a gloomy and depressing picture about humanity who lives in sin being swept of the earth by ""The Creator"",because he's sick and tired of it, so He can start over with a clean slate.But with whom? That's another theological riddle,I suppose.Finally,some elements that seemed disturbing and a bit implausible. That the Ark was immense,I can imagine.But that it's of such a size that a stowaway hasn't been discovered after a year,seems a bit exaggerated.Knowing that the stowaway isn't vegetarian,wouldn't that be detrimental to the resting flock?The pregnancy test made me frown. And the final denouement is entirely hallucinatory.Eventually Noah didn't need to worry about anything in the end,because the offspring was the solution on their own.And otherwise I need to think twice next time,before I use the word ""inbred"".It's an enjoyable film with a few little miss,but still a stunning visual presentation with beautiful,serene interpretations.For those who started tearing their hair and protesting against it: isn't it written in the Bible ""For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.(Matthew 6:14)?I suggest you forgive Aronofsky's artistic freedom and approach this interpretation with a more open mind.That would be a nice example of ""loving one's neighbor"".Amen !",Noah
86,dierregi,Alternative take on the well-known biblical tale,6,12 March 2017,"After the fall from Eden the angels tried to help Adam and Eve but they were banned to Earth and transformed into rocky monsters. With the help of the fallen angels, society developed but then degenerated into brutal tribes. The angels themselves were banned by the humans and the higher power decided to restart the whole Earth project, because his creatures were nasty, cruel and disrespecting their planet.Noah and family living in a post-apocalyptic landscape, are apparently the only decent human beings left around. One night Noah gets a dream pointing in the direction of the ending of humankind. Noah decides he must consult his grandfather MethuselahMethuselah played by Antony Hopkins, looks straight out of a Lord of the Rings movie, has a few words of wisdom and a magic seed to deliver. It takes ten years to build the ark with trees sprouted from the magic seed, so perhaps the prophecy was not that urgent.Closer to departure date, wild tribesmen, guided by a despicable Ray Winstone, approach Noah and his ark and demand to board. This request is obviously denied. In the meantime, the animals are boarding of their own free will and are sedated for safe passage.The ark sets off with a twist that implies some very difficult moral decisions to take. Noah believes all humankind is corrupted and the planet would be better left alone, without inherently evil humans walking on it. Considering how vile is the Winstone character, it is difficult to argue with that.After a dramatic plot twist the movie finally ends with some sort of solace. What you get is some amazing scenes - especially about the creation, some disturbing violence and the more disturbing feeling that things aren't that good nowadays.Mass-scale cruelty against nature and its creatures is still going on and humankind does sort of suck. Noah encourages reflection but I would not watch it again.",Noah

88,jadepietro,No Aahs!,3,14 April 2014,"This film is not recommended.The Creator is not that forgiving in Darren Aronofsky's religious film, Noah. And neither is this reviewer after seeing this miserable movie. The film purports to tell the story of Noah and the ark, and while I cannot say how accurate the scenes depicted in this film were from the original source, I can honestly say it was an absolute bore. (There has been some outrage from many Christian groups about the many liberties taken with the script. Foremost, the lack of the term ""God"" in the script, with ""Creator"" serving as its substitute moniker. My feeling on that matter is that God should be forever thankful that his modern chosen name was not mentioned once in this wretched film.)Aronofsky embellishes the story, but not in a good way. He takes the duality theme quite seriously as the film seems a hybrid mix of Biblical epic and sci-fi fantasy. Neither work. The script pads its story to feature length by introducing: an evil king and carnivore (Ray Winstone, a tad over-the-top) who wants the ark and all of Noah's properties; rock creatures looking like rejects from the Jim Henson Workshop. (These fallen angels, known as Watchers, serve as slave labor in building the ark, a part I am pretty sure is not found in the Old Testament.); a love story for the younger set between one of Noah's sons, Shem, and a rescued waif name Ila, and a rebellious and confused son, Ham, who has authority issues.The visual effects are disappointing, with the only exceptions being the scenes involving the instant growth of a forest and the flood itself. All of the other CGI are adequate at best or artificial looking at worst. The images throughout the film are heavy-handed and banal. The use of time lapse photography is datedly inept. The production design looks like bargain basement Waterworld.Noah surely ages well for a man of 900 years. (One knows he reached the 700 year mark when his hair begins to gray.) Russell Crowe plays the title character and he is a compelling presence. In fact, the actors play their roles with some restraint amid all the doom and gloom. Crowe is fine in the role as is Anthony Hopkins as Methuselah. Jennifer Connelly is particularly effective as Noah's wife, Naameh. Emma Watson, Douglas Booth, Logan Lerman give ample support as the younger generation. The actors cannot be faulted, but the director surely can take the full wrath.The script, by Aronofsky and Ari Handel is an unparalleled mess. This Vegan family is all purity and goodness in the beginning before dysfunction sets in. This clan never questions their father's decisions, that is, until more conflict is needed and the filmmaker brings in the melodramatic excesses. Noah begins the film as a man on a mission, obsessed with visions (not unlike its director) and dissolves into a madman before the film ends with colorful rainbows and heavenly choral music. Yuck!From Noah as a young boy to the voyage of the ark, time flies by in this story, but not in the movie theater. When the film finally ended, I wanted to shout out loud, ""Hallelujah!

90,Seraphion,Too many potentially misleading interpretations and additions though it's a great movie,6,31 March 2014,"Despite the names, character relations, and overall story, The entire movie's very different from Bible. It takes reference from Bible canons, such as Book of Enoch. It also contains a heavy dose of Darren Aronofsky's self-interpretations, developing the short part of the Book of Genesis five through seven into a two-hour movie. The movie thus has way many additions to the religious story. Unfortunately I say most of them are dangerous to any believer's faith.It is thus the ""least biblical biblical movie ever made"", just as stated early on. By stating it early on, there's no point in objecting over the story inaccuracies. The marketing materials state that the movie is staying true to the Bible. Yet the director self-professed himself an atheist, which widens the odds of the movie being untrue to beliefs.There's one great thing about the movie amidst the controversies around it and the problematic interpretations and additions. It's able to stir some to look into their belief about the story and refresh their faith by going back to their religious text and read them at least once more. The depictions of religious verses, even as imperfect ones, dismiss the idea of the story being whether metaphorical. The movie is able to show how did the flood happen in stunning depictions.Yet the controversies cannot be simply dismissed. Replacing the word ""God"" to ""The Creator"", making an early say about the movie not mentioning any reference to the word ""God"", is bold. There's also a wrong depiction of God, that in the movie God never actually speaks, while in many religious texts God does speak to Noah. These are ways to bridge the issue of God and the story's religious nature with Aronofsky's atheist personality.One contrast depiction is that in Genesis 6:9 (NIV), Noah is depicted as righteous and blameless. Yet in this movie he battles others and even kills another with a spear. Another potentially misleading interpretation is that Lamech, Noah's father died before Noah have his sons. According to the Bible, Lamech still lives when the Flood come.The stone angels, or Watchers, depicted as angels who are being disobedient to God and going to earth to help the banished human race. Yet this depiction of the nature of angels as being permitted to help humans although being punished as to have a stone form; and the nature of God as being permissive to the angels' disobedience, are latently dangerous. They are dangerous because they latently depict that God doesn't have jurisdiction of angels to let them fall. Also they depict that fallen angels are still of a good nature, whether in the Scripture on Revelations 12:4 it is said through a parable that fallen angels are the stars, whose place are in the heavens, that are swept by the tail of the demonic red dragon and flung to earth. Those fallen angels are under the power of the dragon's tail, thus making them incapable of any good nature, because since their fall they serve the devil. In my opinion, the fall of a third of all angels into the hand of the devil is permitted by God, as God permits it to be written in the Scripture.There are also great depictions of logical things that are not mentioned in the Bible, which if depicted can be quite freaky, such as the time when serpents enter the ark. There is also the gruesome depiction of human's atrocities, the reason of God's act of global cleansing through the Flood, which is only mentioned shortly in the religious texts, yet depicted quite vividly in the movie. Also there is the logical depiction of other humans, who have seen Noah building the ark, try to board it to safety, or even destroy it.A logical question on the movie's continuity, though. If Methusalah can be that mighty in saving the Watchers with a burning sword, and also be somewhat capable of doing wonders in removing Ila's barrenness, why don't he help defend his grandson's ark from the human horde? Instead he stays to die in the flood.By the way, the depiction of the flood is just great and worthy for a biblical movie. It is vividly and quite accurately depicts the occasion as it is written in the Bible, starts in a matter of seconds, all fountains open up at the same time as the heavens start pouring rain.Yet the additional story part of Noah being somewhat deranged by wanting to kill his grandchildren; and Tubalcain being able to secretly insert himself into the ark and surviving the flood are just unnecessary and stupid and again, weakens the weak-faithed even more.In my opinion, the cast selection is not needing of any more critics. Actors ad actresses of Oscar winning and Oscar nominated movies and roles are just great for a biblical based movie. The acting thus is great overall. One thing noticed is that though maybe the cast has different views and beliefs about the story, they are able to perform professionally and give in to their respective characters, even if that is based on wrong or overly hyperbolic interpretations from the director.The music sits well, just enough to build the mood and not stealing the focus The costumes and makeup is great and matches the dark mood of the whole movie. Even the hairdo is tailored well for the need to portray the world of old. The shooting being set in Iceland clearly depict the old world well.Overall, for me this movie is a 6 out of 10 scoring. Recommendations? Yes I do recommend you to go and see it, but I strongly suggest not to expect much from the movie, and be ready to receive any differences from what your are taught from your childhood least you'd be unsure of your own faith.",Noah

92,burlesonjesse5,Russell Crowe is brilliantly cast in challenging Noah,7,11 May 2014,"If I knew I was going into the theater to watch a bunch of huge, robotic rock caricatures roam the Earth, I'd probably avoid buying a ticket. But I stuck around to experience some good old fashioned fire and brimstone. So without further adieu, I give you the latest biblical release to filter into multiplexes all across the country this March. Ah, let there be Noah!Darren Aronofsky directs and whether or not you believe in his vision being complete hooey, is hearsay. Noah's visuals, said director, and the actors offer to make you think otherwise. Now granted, all of the factors just mentioned, are combined to sell you the audience, every scene in its 2 hour plus running time. Why? To make you believe that this is actually how it went down.Along with subjugating an interesting slant on the Old Testament, Noah also has the luxury of having one of the world's finest movie moguls playing the title character. As God's handily chosen one, Russell Crowe delivers an assured, brilliant performance. He's the go-to thespian for anything biblical or for a better word, historical. His ultimate weapon is his voice. Mr. Crowe undoubtedly has to have one of the greatest acting voices in the history of cinema. I mean I would literally pay this guy to just sit down and read a menu, or a phone book, or heck, even the ingredients on a can of soup. As expected, he is perfectly cast which is another way of saying that there's no other actor who could inhabit this role (expect for maybe the late, great Charlton Heston). And thankfully, he's backed up by a surrounding group of supporting players that almost never hit a false note.Now as a kid, I remember the story of Noah. It's essentially about a man who is told by God to build a huge contraption to hold all animals in two's. He must do this because a flood is coming that intends to end the world as we know it. In this 2014 version, there were a lot of things I didn't see coming. I didn't know that a conflict would arise between good and evil. That role belongs to Ray Winstone who plays Tubal-cain. He's essentially the villain and well, as a youngster, I never knew that villains existed in Noah's plight. Winstone does a solid job as well as the rest of the cast including Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. Connelly, matching Crowe scene for scene, also gives a powerhouse performance as his wife. She has a moment of Oscar glory that might have come too soon in the year. It arrives toward the film's last quarter and maybe voters will remember it come December. Then there's Sir Anthony Hopkins playing a weird, underutilized character as Noah's grandfather. His screen time feels like a couple of cameos. Dare I say that his role came off as comedic rather than serious (he sure had an appetite for some wild berries).Performances aside, if there was one guy who had to take on the reins of bringing the concept of Noah to life, I'm glad it's Aronofsky. He's a visionary filmmaker who first caught my eye with 2000's Requiem for a Dream. He channels a little residue from that film into this one by way of certain cuts and images. His vision for Noah is salty and psychedelic, dark and dreary, and for the most part, modernized. His visuals are sumptuous while his storytelling ability (the film's only weak point) has seen better days. And as bold a director as he is, he still finds time to include an educational, visual feast that feels a little out of place. At I guess 2-3 minutes, it involves Crowe narrating the first chapter of Genesis a la the planetarium scene from 2000's Mission to Mars (I didn't see that coming).Basically Aronofsky's Noah isn't perfect because it establishes characters and situations without a lot of buildup. Things tend to drag a bit especially in the first hour. Added to that, Noah throughout has a fumbled structure with small portions of incoherency. Finally, I felt at times like I was watching Crowe in Gladiator mode (how did Noah learn to fight so well) or taking in scenes filtered right out of 2007's Transformers. Oh yeah and there were times where I thought I was trapped in the world of Lord of the Rings (it's a scene where evil soldiers are trying to get into the ark which is barricaded by the rock creatures mentioned in the first paragraph). Anyway in spite of all this, Noah gets by when the proceedings come down like a sledgehammer in the third and final act. In fact, Noah excels in this act the most when all the animals and humans are already tucked away safely in the ark. The film then gets some legs as it prepares you for a supremely dark detour that you are about to take as an audience member.Bottom line: Aronofsky's direction although skewed, is brilliant and unique. I'm proud of his effort even though it's a little kooky in a way that might dissuade your average churchgoing type. Yes, this March release has flaws but it succeeds by not playing it safe. It's one of those movies where if you think you know where things are headed, you might just be wrong in your assessment. To end this review, I'll leave you with this interesting factoid: according to Aronofsky's harrowing vision, there is one scene taking place near the film's conclusion, who's outcome cements itself to be the reason why all of us humans still exist. Well all I have to say is thank God for that (no pun intended)!",Noah
93,rannynm,"Not a Family Film and Not True to the Biblical Rendition But, It is Good Filmmaking",9,11 April 2014,"This is an unexpected, thought provoking film, based loosely on the biblical story, and I was pleasantly surprised. The world was created and mankind was born. Soon humans became wicked and made the world black. The Creator tells Noah (Russel Crowe) that Earth will be cleansed through a flood. Noah and his family build an ark to save the innocent. The journey begins as Noah wrestles with what the creator is asking of him. This is not a family film, nor is it a film based entirely on the Biblical story. It is a movie. The word God is not used. Instead, the word Creator is used which opens the film to audiences of any belief. The story shows the joy of a second chance but gives a gruesome look at the world. The director shows Noah and his journey as a character. Noah witnesses the barbaric nature of the people and it's hard to watch, however necessary. It makes Noah question if mankind should live at all and how far he'll go to fulfill his task.The actors portray their roles marvelously. The women cast members are particularly outstanding. Emma Watson ( Lla) and Jennifer Connelly (Naameh) are both fantastic. Connelly simply blows you away showing the strong partnership she has with Noah and the struggle that results from it. The cinematography is grand. The locations are unlike anything of this world from the flourishing mountains to the desolate black-paved land. The ark is beyond compare in its massive size. I only wanted them to show us more of the vessel.My favorite character is Noah. Playing a figure of faith is no small feat. Crowe shows the drive and love for the Creator but also the obsession and confusion of his task. This is what makes him human and an interesting character.My favorite scene is when one of the fallen angels, known as The Watchers, tells Noah the tale of how they were cursed. I enjoyed the interesting designs of these characters and their tragic story. It made me empathetic with them. The main message is, ""Higher power is a guide, but it's your personal choice that makes the final decision."" Noah is told, through a dream, that the world will be cleansed. Noah is the one who figures out to build the ark. The Creator doesn't give clear instructions and, in the end, you're still left wondering what the higher power really wants.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 14 to 18-year-olds. This film has violence, disturbing images and brief language. This film took a risk that I highly respect. It sends a Biblical message but is executed differently.Keefer C.

94,Rob_Taylor,Noah idea what I just watched...,5,5 July 2014,"But I can see why religious types are a little peeved with it. I mean, Noah comes across as a complete tool for most of the film.If the aim was to make you dislike him, then I think it worked. Although not religious myself, I hate people shoving it down my throat. Equally, however, and thanks to this movie, I now also hate having a ""rubbish religion for the sake of it"" agenda rammed down my gullet.It's clear Aronofsky had motivation here to try and force a religion is bad motif into the film. Noah, as I said, is unlikeable for much of the movie and seems more like a crackpot than anything else. I have no idea of how much of this is reflected in the Bible, but even to someone like myself, who barely remembers any of the religious stuff that was forced down my throat as a kid, it seems over the top.As well as making Noah a loon, Aronofsky pushes evolution quite hard at a few points. It's actually quite comical to watch. Not that I don't disagree with evolution, but it has about as much place in a religious movie as religion has in an evolution-based film.As if that weren't sufficient, he pushes a ""man makes his own fate"" kind of deal with Ray Winstone's character and goes to great lengths to make you feel some empathy with the man.It's as if Aronofsky wanted to court controversy and that seems to be how it has worked out for him.So how much do I hate, or like the movie? Honestly, not being religious, I can take it or leave it. I can say that I won't go out of my way to watch it a second time, that's for sure! As pure entertainment, it lacks decent pacing. I looked at my watch twice during the showing. The first time to find only thirty eight minutes had gone by (it seemed a lot longer, trust me!) and the second at the one hour ten mark, at which point I realised I was only half way through.Clock watching is a big indicator of a dull film and I'm afraid Noah is no exception. There are some action scenes and some rather woeful attempts at human drama to tempt you into paying attention, but the bulk of the film is a dry, uninspired tedium.I had some vague hope that Ray Winstone's Cain character would end up triumphant, if only because Noah was painted as an a-hole so well, but it was not to be.Whilst I'm on that subject... Ray Winstone as Cain? Really? Who was responsible for that? They might as well have cast Brian Blessed as Noah and made the whole thing into a comedy! All in all, not a very entertaining movie and will be remembered for all the wrong reasons. But I suppose it will at least be remembered, which is something. Then again, I also remember Monkeybone and that was bottom chocolate as well.SUMMARY: Boring and with an agenda shoved so far in your face it is almost comical. Not overly interesting and with an unlikable protagonist and an overacted antagonist, it is sure to elicit laughs and scowls in equal measure. A mess, frankly, and not really worth your time.",Noah
95,bob-rutzel-1,"Not Entirely True, but Somewhat Entertaining",6,30 July 2014,"This is based upon a true Biblical story but Hollywood put its own inaccurate spin on it. Noah (Russell Crowe) builds an Ark to save mankind before the flood engulfs all of humanity.This movie got 3-things right: The name Noah, the ARK, and the Flood. Everything else is pure entertainment. Angels were not turned to stone. God is never mentioned in this movie. Noah never faced an army for those who also wanted the Ark, but Ray Winstone needed a gig and there you have it. Giant monsters did not help Noah build the Ark. Poetic license was taken again, again and again. If all this upsets you, look at it this way: it's entertainment and has nothing to do what you believe in the Biblical Genesis story. It must be mentioned that the director, Darren Aronofsky, is an Athiest. Does that help you? Anyway, leave it to Hollywood to put it's own inaccurate spin on historical happenings with this movie or otherwise. We have seen it time and time again as Hollywood insists on re-writing history. Shame on them. The promos tout: See the story you have not been told. That is true because it's all made up. Noah is real, the Ark is real and the Flood is real. That's it. With all that aside let's look at this as purely entertainment, shall we? Production-wise it is excellent. The acting was good, not great. The CGI was terrific as CGI always is.

96,mike48128,A Biblical Nightmare of monsters and redemption,6,16 May 2016,"Ray Harryhausen would have been proud. Cursed tree-like angels known as ""The Watchers"" are nightmarish fallen angels that glow with the ""fire"" of the Creator. They help Noah build the Ark and stomp out what's left of the evilness of Humanity. What's left is enough for several more nightmares. Not much for the computer generated animals to do. Especially bad for the insects and snakes. Noah's family is cursed with typically ""oversexed"" teen-aged sons. A barren adopted girl and a very understanding wife. All the animals are put to sleep with a potion and it appears that everybody is ""Vegan"". The woods grow from a magic ""seed"" and I expect to see Abbott and Costello chasing a giant any minute. Ludicrous. The tribe-family of ""Cain"" represents the evilness and vileness of Mankind and their leader, (representing Satan?) stows away on the Ark to kill Noah and sabotage everything. Then, the girl, after a miracle cure from Grandfather Methuselah, gives birth to twins. Noah's young son ""Shem"" is the father. Noah, at first, thinks he must kill the baby girls, so all of Mankind will parish, but thankfully changes his mind after a horribly tense scene, involving knifes, wailing, begging, as the family is almost destroyed. The waters recede and all the creatures leave the Ark. Noah goes off, gets drunk and naked, and lives as a recluse in a cave. He thinks he has failed the Creator. A big ending (yes, I am thinking of Mel Brooks) involving rainbows, bright blue sea colors, triumphal music with kettle drums,big hugs, and adorable animal babies. Finally, something warm and Disney-like. This all leaves several unanswered questions: What does raw snake-head taste like? How can the Human Race be renewed without some type of incest? Again, no dinosaurs? A 2 hour 20 minute exercise in cinematic torture. Almost an obscene monster movie. Unlike any biblical version I ever read or watched before. I thought Noah's sons brought their wifes with them? Great CGI By Industrial Light and Magic, of course. So, who's gonna clean up this mess of a movie, let alone the inside of the Ark? Definitely not for the kiddies. I hated it.Religious footnote: Noah uses a primitive form of Jewish ""Tefillin"", which is a leather prayer ""strap"" wound around the entire arm.

97,Sergeant_Tibbs,Captivating - in good and bad ways.,6,1 September 2014,"Where has Darren Aronofsky been the last 4 years? Noah, that's where. A bizarre world of slightly off CGI creatures, talking rock monsters and overblown melodrama. If The Wrestler and Black Swan are comparable in style, then this is closest to The Fountain, another polarising venture that took years to get off the ground. However, this one doesn't work quite as well, not having that thought-provoking existential angle that makes The Fountain a profound experience. Not to say that Aronofsky is slacking here on the technical side, Noah still has his abrasive and captivating style with quick cuts and breath-taking cinematography, though its production suffers from its concept. It's better to just treat it like a fantasy film. Like the overly serious parts of Lord of the Rings meets Jim Henson's campy 80s movies.It results in a film that's really difficult to embrace but kind of enjoyable in a silly way. There are some great scenes, but they're admirable for their boldness rather than their finesse. Its melodrama is hard to take seriously, especially when it tries too hard to make Russell Crowe's Noah a dark figure, giving him very unsympathetic choices and obvious moral dilemmas. Otherwise the performances are quite committed and impressive, but suffer from the lack of character depth, especially Jennifer Connelly. It has a lot to thank Clint Mansell's exhilarating score for holding it all together but as a whole it just doesn't work. There's just too many bits that you don't believe, especially since many people take the Bible quite literally. Noah often leaves you awe-struck in what you're watching but not in a good way. It is worth watching, at least, if just out of morbid curiosity. Hopefully he'll bounce back with something down to Earth.6/10",Noah

99,Screen_Blitz,Russell Crowe soars in this tense biblical epic,7,8 July 2016,"Visually stunning imagery and fantastic performances by a thoroughly likable cast come together in this tense action adventure based on what many call one of the best biblical stories ever told. Darren Aronofsky gives a compelling vision of the tale Noah's Ark, a story many have grown familiar with from the bible. Though he manages to take some notable liberties from the story such as the interpretation of The Watchers, Aronofsky's vision stays true in terms of religious themes. Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel's script doesn't sustain without a few blemishes here and there but the film does not do too much to disappoint, although is not unlikely Christians could take offense to the liberties injected into the story. The film opens with brief excerpt telling a story of how the creator (referring to God) gave birth to the universe in seven days following a brief tale centering on Cain and Abel. Russell Crowe plays Noah, the husband of his wife Naameh (played by Jennifer Connolly) and father of sons Ham (played by Logan Lerman), Shem (played by Douglas Booth), and Judapth (played by Leo McHugh Carroll), and later Shem's wife Ila (played by Emma Watson). Noah becomes haunted by visions of an apocalyptic event, he soon learns it is a message from God claiming a devastating flood is set wipe out the Earth to cleanse the world of sin. In this fateful event, Noah and his family must fight to survive while facing what they believe is a wrath of God.Darron Aronofsky flourishes an incredible vision in this updated retelling of the biblical tale, though his narrative style doesn't rank up the film's visual spectacle. The film was shot on a coast of Iceland which provides a beautiful backdrop for the film's primitive setting, and for the story's time period it suites quite appropriately. But this is not quite as impressive as the sequences featuring the building of Noah's ark following the apocalyptic flood that ravages in the home land along with everywhere across the globe, both of which are visually alluring and difficult not to admire. The giant stone-made monsters known as The Watchers on the other hand, are a bit questionable; particularly with the CGI. Aronofsky's screenplay however, lies most of film's defects. Though it kicks off on a fairly good start introducing the premise, the middle act is a bit plodding and proceeds at a sluggish pace. During this act, we experience the transformation of the titular character as he lead learns the massive flood is an act of God and and how's he angry with the sins that runs amok in the world. This also includes a concept of Noah refusing the let this children have babies to repopulate as he believes it's against God's plan. These concepts are to some extent interesting but they drag on the story for such a long time it gets a little tedious. Despite these blemishes, the film manages to overcome some of these flaws with a sweeping performance by Russell Crowe who demonstrates an engrossing depiction of the titular character. It may not be his most memorable role in recent memory but it fits the bill. Jennifer Connolly is also impressive but perhaps not on the par with Crowe as the wife of his character. The young actors including Logan Lerman, Douglas Booth , Leo McHugh Carroll, and Emma Watson all do a fine job. However, don't expect anything in the Oscar category.Noah is a compelling epic adventure generated by the hands of Darren Aronofsky. This film manages to impress at both a visual level and performance level succeeding only at a surface level in the narrative aspect. Though this movie may not be the most memorable in the epic action category, it makes for a somewhat entertaining experience.",Noah
100,Troy_Campbell,"Good, but could've been better.",6,28 March 2014,"Under normal circumstances, a big screen telling of Noah's tale wouldn't be a project that filled me with excitement or intrigue. Although with Darren Aronofsky (The Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream) writing and directing, the circumstances were anything but normal, and consequently my expectations grew. I should've kept them lower, as this weird biblical epic fails to fully ignite. The biggest hurdle in Noah is the inclusion of the Watchers – fallen angels who are turned into rock monsters by the Creator – who are so out of place it's extremely hard to take anything else seriously. There are sparks of brilliance to be found, such as an emotionally powerful scene between Noah (Russell Crowe) and his adopted daughter Ila (Emma Watson) after she has just given birth, yet these are often undercut by something too bizarre to be believable, even in the semi-mystical context of this film. The CGI is at times not up to scratch, especially when the multitude of animals (all digitally created) are on screen, however the huge, Earth-flooding set piece is absolutely breathtaking in both its enormity and its execution. There are no weak links among the cast (also including Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone and Logan Lerman) however Crowe is particularly sensational as the eponymous ark-maker, demonstrating why he is still in high demand for these hefty lead roles.

103,brchthethird,An ecological parable that still amazes despite a somewhat clunky narrative,7,14 November 2014,"NOAH, directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Russell Crowe, is an ambitious effort with some jaw-dropping visuals and compelling themes that still suffers from a few narrative and character development problems.Most people are probably familiar with the story, even non-Christians. Basically, God regrets having created the world and decides to destroy it by flood, save Noah, his family and the animals. Most Christians should be pleased to know that the core story remains intact, although there are some (necessary) embellishments which help to flesh it out and add some drama. A couple of these ""additions"" include rock-imprisoned fallen angels, called Watchers (which do have roots in the Bible and the Torah) and a major plot development involving a Biblical character known as Tubal-Cain (Ray Stevenson). In my opinion, these additions (which will probably rile fundamentalists and Biblical literalists) serve the story which Aronofsky was trying to tell and enhance the overall narrative in a meaningful way.Besides the obvious parallels one could draw to our current environmental crisis, the biggest takeaway I got from this film was (hopefully obviously) the character of Noah and Russell Crowe's excellent central performance. Naturally, the task which Noah was saddled with (or so he thinks) would bear hard on the person carrying it out and Crowe portrays well the blind devotion and conflicted nature necessary to make Noah accessible as a character, yet stay true to the source material. Regarding the other performances, none really stood out as either good or bad, although Ray Winstone does get to chew the scenery as the villain, Tubal-Cain. The main reason for me saying this is that the supporting cast isn't really given much to work with. Yes, the story is supposed to be Noah-centric, but it would have helped if the rest of the cast were given more to work with than mostly driving the plot forward. Even Anthony Hopkins, who is quite entertaining as Noah's grandfather Metheuselah only appears in a few scenes which boil down to narrative conveniences (especially in his next to last scene). Still, the weighty themes are more than enough to carry the story forward. The last gripe I have about the narrative is that it was a bit clunky/disjointed. By that, I mean that at times it felt episodic, and there are some pacing issues early on.Moving on, the other are worth talking about is the visual effects and spectacle, and as Aronofsky's first big-budget studio film it mostly doesn't disappoint. The special effects were very well realized, from natural scenery to the animals. The only issue I had was with the ""rock monsters,"" which didn't fare well when compared to the effects work surrounding them. I don't know quite what it was, but at times they looked more like stop-motion creations than organic beings. Also worth mentioning is a well-done battle scene as Tubal-Cain and his army lay siege to the ark as the flood begins. This was the most epic part of the film and, for my money, also the best part. Not to say that everything else was bad, but this scene in particular unified the narrative that surrounded it and provided an outlet for all of the conflict that had been brewing up until that point.There are a few other things that could be worthy of discussion, however I want to leave some surprises for people who are as yet unaware of what happens in the film. Suffice it to say that, despite the few narrative problems I described above, NOAH is a visual treat and deals with some weighty themes in a compelling way. If you're the least bit curious about this film, then see it.",Noah
104,maurice_yacowar,Modern update and improvement upon Genesis version,7,30 March 2014,"Every age or culture needs its own Great Flood myth, usually of rebirth. That's why there have been so many of them, to which tradition our Genesis version — starring the 400-year- old Noah — was rather a latecomer. As Darren Aronofsky is more conversant with alternative versions and has a more sophisticated grasp upon myth making and Biblical studies, his version might have a good deal more substance. As a moral guide, this is far superior to Genesis.Aronofsky adds a psychological dimension missing from the skimpy Genesis version. The central family suffers internal conflicts as compelling as the global destruction. As the macro reflects the micro, after the floods the pregnant Ila (Emma Watson) has her personal breaking of the waters.Aronofsky also gives Noah a moral ambivalence. Determined to fulfil God's will, the elimination of the human race that despoiled His creation, this Noah coldly denies salvation to anyone outside his family. He abandons the girl that Ham (Logan Lerman) tries to bring back for the family trip. Denying Ham a wife is Noah's first step into presuming to divine authority. But the prospect of granddaughters pushes Noah's sense of duty to madness. Noah threatens to kill any grand-daughters lest they thwart God's intention to eliminate mankind. Noah fails to read Ila's pregnancy as a sign of God's presence and approval, in the Old Testament tradition of barren births. In showing God's servant turning murderous madman Aronofsky introduces the modern threat of religious extremism, whether Muslim, Haredim or any other bloody-minded righteousness. When Noah's wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and stepdaughter Ila try to dissuade him from his cruel course, Aronofsky counteracts the Old Testament's harsh patriarchy.Aronofsky's most explicit imposition is his ecology. Noah teaches young Ham not to pick a flower he doesn't really need. The evil Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) is the carnivore against Noah's vegetarian, another contemporary inflection. The difference in diet contrasts Noah's sense of man serving nature and Tubal-Cain's, that nature serves man. Where Noah attests to the primacy of Nature Tubal-Cain claims the primacy of man. Guess which God prefers. Though He speaks to neither, Noah at least reads His signs — or what he thinks they are. As we don't hear or see God here, divinity is properly left in man. God is in Noah's instinctive love for the infant girls. A later montage in silhouette — the perfect medium for undifferentiated human conflict — traces the historic range of human warfare, brother against brother, nation against nation, that has laid our physical world and humanity to waste. When Noah dreams he is plodding through a blood-stained earth the reference is not just to wars but to man's destructive pollution of his world. Cain killing Abel becomes the recurring pattern for human behaviour — warfare. Aronofsky creates Tubal-Cain to embody the killer Cain's lasting heritage.Aronofsky begins with an anti-Edenic view, that Evil is the driving force in life. His first shot is of the serpent, then the forbidden fruit. At several points Noah sees the serpent shucking off its innocent appearance to assail innocence. That's also the function of Noah's arch-enemy, Tubal-Cain, whom young Noah sees kill Noah's father and who sneaks into the ark and is nourished back to health by the rebellious Ham. Aronofsky also inflects the ending. Despite his saving instinct of love, Noah's shame at having failed his God by letting the twin girls live implicitly drives him into alienation and drunkenness. In Genesis Ham sees his father's nakedness and is therefore banished, an eternal curse placed upon him and his descendants (however he might get them). As racists used that to justify the enslavement of Ham's African descendants, Aronofsky plays the scene differently. Ham in his backpack comes to say goodbye to Noah, who is lying naked until Shem and Japheth — careful to look away — cover him with a blanket. This Ham departs uncursed. Perhaps Aronofsky's most controversial creation are the Watchers. the plodding Golems of rock that, despite man's earlier betrayal, now help Noah both in building the ark and in fighting off the attacking baddies. In fact, they're a clever icon. Their rocky lumpiness makes them a hardened variation on the human's origin and end in dust. More specifically, they are described as having originally been creatures of light, fallen angels, who helped mankind against God's wishes and were consequently punished by conversion into this heavy materiality. Here they return to God's grace by helping Noah on his divine mission. Thus they gain redemption. When they die in battle they explode back into light and are drawn back into the super-astronomical heavens. Again, they replay the human hope for illumination and redemption beyond material existence.This is another key inflection of Genesis. This Noah is not an elderly sage but a generally sensitive warrior. Though a vegetarian into flower power, he slaughters great numbers of bad guys, not just through the flood but in hand-to-hand whirligig. The Watchers' windmill killings are like Noah's, evidence that God's justice allows for no pacifism in the face of evil. As we don't live in Gandhi's political order anymore, the killings by Noah and his rocky aides suggest a contemporary realism. We have seen the effectiveness of civil disobedience in Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Iran, much of Africa. Hence Aronofsky's injection — and validation — of mortal combat in defence of virtue. As an efficient killer with a clouding conscience Russell Crowe is a perfect casting — despite being so much younger than the original Noah.For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",Noah
105,Andy-296,"Well made entertainment, though with some questionable things",8,3 April 2014,"The first biblical epic made by Hollywood in many decades isn't too faithful to its source: the presence of Stone giants should be a clue to that. Noah (Russell Crowe) is, in modern parlance, a quite fanatical environmentalist. Not only he is a vegetarian, but he reproaches his son when he picks up a flower. You see, he only eats those fruits and vegetables that had already fallen to the ground (such extreme ethics won't impede him from killing scores of men if it needs be). His family of gatherers stands in contrast with the mean men living in the dirty proto industrial cities, places where sin and disobedience to God (or the Creator, as the movie calls him) rules. That Noah values animals over men is seen by his ultimate plan (which he claims has been dictated to him by the Creator): he wants humanity to become extinct after the flood. That's why when he learns that his daughter (Emma Watson) is pregnant, he vows to kill her baby if it turns out to be a girl, as he wants the survivors of the flood to be the last humans on Earth. Criticism aside one must admit this is a generally well made, compelling and entertaining movie. Anthony Hopkins has a nice cameo as Methuselah, who is portrayed here as an ancient Gandalf like wizard (the Lord of the Rings seems to have been as much as an influence on this movie as the Bible here). Ray Winstone is fine as the chief Bad guy, the king of the evil men Tubal Cain. Also with Jennifer Connelly as Noah's wife. The barren locations (mostly in Iceland) help.",Noah

107,PartialMovieViewer,Pretty Bad,2,8 June 2014,"'Spoiler Alert – Spoiler Alert.' This is a product of Holly-weird. Like much of the town's recently cranked out merchandise, it often ends up being forgettable – BUT – not Noah. This remarkable extravaganza will be remembered – forever. In fact, I actually do smell sequel – maybe even a series, like 'NCIS'. (There might be some sarcasm in this review as well) When I go to the movies I am not looking for anything other than entertainmentnot religionnot historynot realityjust good old cinema-graphic fun. I will say that this gala event provided some pretty awesome escapism, mostly in the form of laughter. I saw this movie with a bunch of guys accompanied by beers and chips. The best and only way to properly digest something this appalling. I have determined that one needs a whole different mindset in order to shift one's perspective. Anyways, we all verbally shared appreciation and rendered support through active commentary. From beginning to end I laughed so much my sides were aching. In fact, I am laughing now - making it very difficult to pen any kind of serious review. Not to worry, I will try.For me, I would have tweaked the acting a bit. I do like Russell Crowe he always is clear when mumbling his parts, his recognizable slouch is always welcomed, and he is a very talented actor. Most of the other actors went through the motions and – with Mr. Crowe – that is pretty much all that is needed. Sadly, someone had the idea of throwing Hermione into the mix. And why did they do that? Emma Watson's continuous screeching only inspired many early theater departures. I can take her in small doses, but her high-pitched griping killed some of the funnier moments. I was a bit disappointed that there was only one armadillo-dog. I mean you have only one of these doga-dillos, and then it's killed. What's this all about? Just think of all the chuckles you could have gotten from those ugly, four legged creatures. 'Excuse me sir – does your dog have scales?' 'No!' 'I thought you said your dog didn't have scales.' 'That is not my dog.' OH - and think about this funny skit - just naming the damned thing could have taken up at least five minutes of the movie. Meh – squandered comedy. The Rock Monsters – oh – The Holy Rock Monsters. These guys were my heroes, they were perfect. At first, I would have gone with an army of Rock Lobsters, but now I know I was wrong. It is much more important to have Holy Rock Monsters, especially when they all sounded like Optimus Prime. Alas, their humor was a bit dry. But what do you expect from a bunch of rocks. Granted - This movie is not for everyone, it really wasn't for me. If you take this movie as a serious study in 'Noah', it is abhorrent - and that is being nice. Please remember, it was created to make money, not change lives. Sadly, it is too long; has way too much CGI; often overacted (Emma-fide), and overdone all the way around. Even if you erase the name, 'Noah' and replace it with something else it still ends up being disappointing. Honestly I will not see this thing again. I do appreciate the honesty in the hype and advertising. It made me aware of what I was in for. This was clearly peddled as an action/adventure (no – it wasn't art – it really wasn't) – so I knew accuracy was tossed in the toilet. Some people will like it and some will not. I did not. Side note: I really wish these directors would re-think CGI. It is not always neededand often looks fake.",Noah
108,adamscastlevania2,Entertaining Biblical extravaganza,7,11 September 2014,"(63%) A perfectly good, entertaining, big-budget Biblical popcorn flick. Russell Crowe - along with his supporting cast are strong, the direction is pretty faultless and it has a feel that the makers at least cared about making a quality production, and the sometimes very dark elements work well. I had a feeling that once the ark was built the film would have nowhere else to go, but if anything the more interesting things happen after the flood arrives. So for a movie based a bible story it's not overly religious in the slightest, and with it's rock monsters, very exciting battle sequence and CGI effects, this comes recommended even to atheists.",Noah

110,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A somewhat plausible plot with stunning visuals.,8,8 March 2019,"If there's any filmmaker more controversial than Darren Aronofsky, I'm not sure who it would be at this point. Interestingly enough, while most of his films are rated ""R"" (or higher, like the uncut Requiem for a Dream (2000)), I think Noah (2014) is the first time one of his films has been at the PG-13 rating. Since most of the controversy of his movies comes via the content that would make it R-rated, it's interesting that the controversy with Noah is more along the lines of how Aronofsky filled in the gaps and created a dramatic narrative inside the Biblical story of Noah.As is always the case with an Aronofsky film, Noah is a beautiful spectacle of filmmaking. Even if the landscapes of Iceland helped create this stunning setting, certain dream-like sequences and moments speak to the art that Aronofsky can evoke on the screen. The setting of the pre-flood world is believable, and most of the costumes and characters make sense, with the exception being the CGI-fueled ""fallen angels."" Because the film is distinctly in the visual style of Aronofsky, there were a few ""artistic liberties"" taken with the story to create this contrast of good vs. evil.I do find it interesting how a short story that comprises a small section of Genesis in the Bible was able to be filled out to a movie that's over 2-hours long. What helps piece together this narrative is the context of the Biblical story before this event. Drawing conclusions from what we know about the lineage as well as a number of Biblical specifics, the plot seems mostly plausible. That being said, there are a few facets to the story that contrasts with what the Bible says. Still, if it gets people to pick up a Bible and start reading, all the better.A somewhat plausible plot with stunning visuals, I give Noah 4.0 stars out of 5.",Noah

I didn't remember The Watchers from the Bible.Some observations: Hopkins good as Methusalah. Crowe excellent. Emma perfect. The babies just missed getting whacked by Grandpa. They looked about 8 months old near the end of the movie. Two different pairs of infant actors -- but as an afterthought, the newborn babies looked sort of like ugly and bad CGI creations. More observations: Was Noah wearing jeans? Were they Levi's, Wranglers or Lee? Was this the past or the future? Did the family live in a Yurt? That's a pretty pricey camping tent/cabin in today's parlance.The mother worked hard. She didn't appear to be very much appreciated. Loved it when she yelled/screamed at Noah. If one of those guys from the Cain descendants had run off with her, old Noah may have started appreciating her very fast. Noah needed to pay more attention to her. Now if the Cain-King had kidnapped her, Noah might have had to take at least a few seconds away from his carpentry career in order to save her ala Superman, Batman, Spider Man, et al. If not, Noah would no longer have her to do the gardening.10/10",Noah
112,cultfilmfan,Darren Aronofsky's Noah,8,18 April 2014,"Before going to see Darren Aronofsky's version of Noah, I had been hearing a lot of backlash online from Christians who had gone to see the movie and had heard backlash from right within my own church as well. I still had an interest in seeing the film though, mostly because of my admiration for Darren Aronofsky's other films, so I went into the theatre with an open mind and decided to judge the film as a piece of art and entertainment rather than an accurate account of the biblical story in the book of Genesis. First off, I can see where Christians would be turned off, or offended by the film because it strays so far from the original story and adds elements and things in there that were never mentioned, or even heard of in Noah's story, or anywhere else in the Bible. Also the film does have a very desolate and apocalyptic feel to it and the whole sense of nihilism, emptiness and a world with a lack of God is pictured here. While, I think many would consider the original Noah story in the Bible to be somewhat uplifting and giving hope, showing God's grace and forgiveness, would instead find this version to be bleak and almost depressing in a sense. There was also a storyline that comes about in this film involving the Emma Watson character in the film, which I found started out interestingly enough, but in the last half it almost becomes a bit offensive and in poor taste I found. Having said all that, I still overall did like Darren Aronofsky's version of Noah. Russell Crowe delivers one of his strongest performances as Noah, and I found it interesting the way the film analyzed and looked at Noah. It made him look very human with flaws and dreams, but also battling with his own personal demons and troubles as well. This was a multi layered character with a lot to look at and think about and while some may have found that offensive, I personally thought it added a lot to the film and really gave breath and a different way of looking at this whole story. The other performances were all quite strong as well. The film moved along at quite a good pace and much to my liking, it was not heavy on special effects, or disaster scenes, which was one of my concerns going into the film. I was worried about seeing an effects laden film with a lot of disaster scenes, people drowning and various other elaborate and self indulgent ways to show the flood in the film. Thankfully, Aronofsky stayed clear of that and focused more on telling an interesting story. Even though the film does use some special effects, I did not find them overwhelming, or that they took away from the story, or the film in any way. I thought they were handled most appropriately. The makeup, sets, costumes and overall look of the film was quite impressive also showing the desolate and almost apocalyptic in a sense, time these characters were living in and none of the cast and crew made anything look flashy, or glamorous in a Hollywood type of way, which I really appreciated because it gave the film more of an earthy and real feel to it. The film overall is nowhere close to being accurate to theology, or the original Bible story, but if you go into this film knowing that like I had and choose to separate this film from that and just look at it as a piece of art and entertainment, than maybe you will have a better chance of liking it, or getting something out of it for other fellow Christian viewers. I could definitely see where people would be offended and consider this new film to be dark, depressing and just really nothing like the original story in Genesis. At the same time, I do have to give credit where credit is due and compliment Aronofsky on his interesting vision for this film because it does have a certain sense of creativity and originality to it with good character study and development for the character of Noah as well as being an overall fascinating, philosophical and thought provoking film that will definitely have the audience thinking and questioning the film afterwards whether you are a Christian, atheist, agnostic, or of a totally different religion whatsoever. I find it a little strange that Crowe, Aronofsky and crew, tried to get the Pope's blessing on this film and personally I can see why he did not do that. I think too many people would have been in an uproar and it just would not have been a sound or good move to do so. Looking at Noah, in the way I have described, I still admire it as a film and work of art and I am still glad that I gave the film a chance and overall enjoyed it as a piece of entertainment and art, but going nowhere near any real biblical, or other truths and with that in mind I recommend the film, but I would say research it a little bit before seeing it like I did.",Noah

The cinematography is excellent. The CGI Is outstanding. The movie runs a tad long and at times the score is too noticeable and a bit distracting.Like most literary ship captains Noah himself becomes obsessive and disturbed. There could be a mutiny on the ark. The man villain created for the story from the Cain clan fills the needed role and puts a ""Wait Until Dark"" moment into the movie. The Watchers are a bit controversial and jolting rock stars. Methuselah with his healing hand deserved better then being played as a loon chasing berries.Even with it's flaws the movie works as an epic adventure. It should be enjoyed on the big screen.",Noah
114,Anurag-Shetty,"An entertaining film but, it was a little dragging.",7,29 March 2014,"Noah is a movie based on the Biblical character of the same name. After Noah(Russell Crowe) sees visions from God, of the world getting destroyed by an apocalyptic flood, he sets out to build an ark to protect every creature that's innocent in this world namely, animals. He sets out to do this with the help of his wife, Naameh(Jennifer Connelly), sons, Ham(Logan Lerman), Shem(Douglas Booth) & Japheth(Leo McHugh Carroll), daughter, Ila(Emma Watson) & grandfather, Methuselah(Anthony Hopkins). When some humans, led by Tubal-cain(Ray Winstone), try to take refuge in Noah's ark, he prevents them as mankind is not innocent. Now, it's up to Noah & his family to protect the ark from all the humans & ultimately, the flood. Let me be honest with you. I went to watch this movie, only for Emma Watson. I'm a huge fan of her & I probably wouldn't have gone to the theater to watch this, if she wasn't in it. I enjoyed the film. The 3D is effective. However, the first half of the movie was dragging. All the characters are just talking & nothing significant is happening. The performances in the film, are its strong point. Russell Crowe is flawless as Noah. Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as Naameh. Ray Winstone is great as the antagonist, Tubal-cain. Anthony Hopkins is outstanding in his small yet, substantial role of Methuselah. Emma Watson has delivered the best performance of her career as Ila. Watson has portrayed a wide assortment of emotions like, happiness, fear, grief & so forth, effortlessly. Logan Lerman has also given his career best, as the undecided son, Ham. Douglas Booth is brilliant as Shem. Leo McHugh Carroll is impressive as Japheth.

116,Danusha_Goska,An Atheist's Badass God,6,30 March 2014,"The storyteller telling the Noah story faces this serious challenge: how to make the protagonist sympathetic. This is a bigger challenge than explaining the logistics: How one man and his family were able to build an ark capacious enough to accommodate all species on earth and sturdy enough to withstand a flood; how rain could fall hard enough to flood the entire planet; how to feed all those creatures and eliminate their waste products. I've worked with animals and mucking out five stalls every morning was, well, Herculean. No, the bigger challenge is how to get the audience to sympathize with God, the real protagonist of the story (Noah is just God's tool). The God of the Noah story is all too much like the Pagan divinities of ancient Greece: petulant, fickle, and not all that bright. God creates mankind and loves mankind, but then God turns on mankind, eager to wipe out mankind. God preserves some humans, but among the humans God preserves is Ham, who is accused of ""seeing his father naked,"" which some take to mean that he humiliated, castrated, or perhaps sodomized Noah. In other words, the remnant this God saved is not any better than the masses God drowned. Duh. I was looking forward to Darren Aronofsky's ""Noah"" not only for the special effects flood and animals, but also because I wanted to see how Aronofsky would justify his God. What would be the great evil that Aronofsky would attribute to humanity? Why did we deserve to be wiped out? If this were Cecil B. DeMille, our sin would certainly be sex. Sex sells tickets and entertains audiences. A swaggering, bare chested Yul Brynner married to the very hot Anne Baxter deserved God's smiting! Aronofsky assigns a much more prosaic sin to humanity: environmental destruction. Noah, Aronfsky's hero, subsists on lichens. This is ridiculous; no one gets to be as beefy as Russell Crowe by eating lichens only. (Jennifer Connelly, Noah's wife, is quite thin and I can believe that she eats nothing but lichens.) The rest of mankind hunts animals, eats meat and mines minerals. Also humans chop down a lot of trees. Tubal Cain, the king of the bad humans, is a miner. There is a scene where Noah walks through a blasted wasteland of tree stumps. Think of that the next time you use toilet paper, made from trees!!! Also, humans are shown eating flesh ripped from a living animal. People also engage in much violence, and there is a smudgy rape scene. The sin that gets the most attention, though, is environmental destruction. ""Noah""'s greatest strength, for me, was its seriousness. The God of ""Noah"" is a badass God who gets very, very angry and takes no prisoners. He is a mythic, superhero God who supplies his chosen with ""Watchers,"" giants made out of stone who have glowing, fiery eyes. Darren Aronofsky is a self-described atheist, but he has put a Godzilla divinity on screen. This God is not New Age. He is not touchy feely. He is not singing Kumbaya. There is such a thing as sin, and if you sin, Godzilla's foot squashes you. The angry God and sin part of ""Noah"" surprised me and gripped me. The scenes of humans clinging to rocks and howling as they drowned were powerful and frightening. I would not bring a small child to this movie. The rest of the movie was only so-so. The special effects were meh. The animals are all CGI; Aronofsky has said that he does not believe in working with real animals, presumably because it discomfits the animals. A lover of good animal footage would get much more enjoyment out of watching any given animal video on youtube than from ""Noah."" The flood was okay. The stone giant Watchers were interesting at first but quickly became semi-comical. The second half of the movie revolves around a couple of non-Biblical subplots – a stowaway on the ark, and Noah becoming obsessed with killing someone – and those did not grab my interest.",Noah

Together with his family and a group of banished angels, he begins work as soon as possible but a large group of corrupt humans is not going to make their task easy.This movie is an adaptation of the apocalypse from the bible with some big differences which manage only make it a lot worse. I was tempted to believe that such a cast cannot make a bad movie but I was more than wrong. It's characters are, to say the least, retarded! It seems like almost every action they make is intentionally done to contradict any logic and common sense, acting like they had absolutely no idea why they were there. The events are as forced as they can get, and I'm not referring here to the natural event. There's a scene where a one legged human struggles to climb a huge framing and starts to hit the wooden barge with an ax, barely making any damage while the water was a couple of seconds away, while in the next five seconds he manages to enter it without any water coming inside. The same human is able to stay in the same place for about an year, undetected and almost without any wounds, eventually confronting Noah in a melee combat. Simply unbelievable... Exaggerations like this are something common so if you're a bit picky, like I am, you might even find your intelligence insulted.The only upside of this movie can be its visuals but they don't excel in any way.

118,jrarichards,"Cohesive, ingenious, inspiring and moving",10,31 October 2017,"It maybe says something that this film has been quite regularly derided and panned, when it in fact has so very much to offer.For me - perhaps alone in the world - this is a good film, easily holding its own with any Biblical epic from early eras that you can think of.As a bonus, it has a flavour of dystopian sci fi (""The Road"" and others) about it, contrasting the good personified by Noah and his wife (ably played, with conviction, by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly), and their family; with the rest of humanity turned to industrialisation and environmental despoilation, violence, lack of care, evil of all kinds, even cannibalism.And of course it tells the Bible story most beloved of kids (perhaps kids of all ages) for thousands of years. Which kid has not marvelled at pictures of the Ark, or built a mini one for him/herself? It was one of my abiding passions more years ago now than I care to remember.Here there is no detracting from the Biblical story, yet where and when necessary that story is reinforced in its cohesiveness, with deft directorial touches from Darren Aronofksy. The development of the paradise in which the Ark is built and then the arrival of successive waves of animals is surely affecting to any who are not made of stone? It's hugely elemental and meaningful in a manner that is beyond criticism ... or indeed derision. In general, the special effects are more than adequate for the purpose, and to moan about the slightly bandwagon-following ""Stone Giants"" seems churlish. When all's said and done, how do we know what a fallen angel looks like? Yet, beautifully enough, Noah's muscular godliness, absolute goodness and determination to serve, no matter what, blinds him in a way that the slightly more-nuanced convictions of his more down-to-earth wife will not allow. Humanly, her love of family exceeds her faith in God - a tricky call in Old Testament terms, as we know. Yet ultimately she makes her stubborn man see reason, and this is a nice touch in the middle of all the black v white stuff, inspiring as that often proves to be.Anthony Hopkins with his huge screen presence is in there as a very impressive Methuselah (Noah's grandfather), and - personally speaking - I found profoundly moving a tiny Brit-with-Brit scene in which he encounters and ""heals"" the daughter (as played by Emma Watson) that his grandson has adopted and raised, who is infertile due to injury. This is one of the best parts I have seen Emma take (which may not be saying that much), but she certainly presents her age-old predicament touchingly and powerfully enough here.The film comes in at over 2 hours, while the number of lines devoted to this tale in The Bible is not great. But it always was a marvellous story (conceivably with a grain of end-of-Ice Age truth about it), and this film version does all it can to convey that tale with warmth and conviction, and with a specific mix of majesty and humility.",Noah

It lacks the gravity of being a Hollywood blockbuster, there is an edge missing.Plot is of course made according to the Bible story of Noah, but in the effect it is an invented story only loosely based on the Bible story. It is interesting and kept my attention.Acting is great by Russel Crowe, other actors are a little bit to be desired. Of course Anthony Hopkins is always up to par.I am not sure would I recommend this film for you to go with your girl friend with, but rather it is a family movie.When I left the cinema it was raining cats and dogs. ;)",Noah
121,jdkraus,NoahAronofsky's psychological study of how far one man is willing to go in order to serve his Creator...,8,13 April 2014,"Noah. The man who built an ark and saved both humanity and the animals from the great flood was among my most favorite of Biblical tales when I was small child. The concept and story is fascinating yet the Old Testament is a bit vague on the events that transpired. In making a film of such a story, certain liberties and imagination are to take hold. This is a movie not based entirely on Scripture. No doubt this has caused backlash from the Christian purists that are only interested in the words of the Holy Text. Hard core Atheists on the other end of the spectrum make an equal stand against the film. As Jon Stewart mentioned on the Daily Show, many of these people either (a) have not seen the film and are bashing it or (b) do not understand the themes and entertainment that this movie has to offer. Putting religion and evolution aside, Darren Aronofsky delivers a picture not so much of what may have happened, but rather the psychology of Noah and the horrors/trials he had faced to fulfill his task for the Creator.From the opening sequence, we are presented with a world of violence and barbarity. A silhouette scene of Cain killing Abel becomes the reoccurring cornerstone of this theme. Noah at a young age gets a first hand account of man's inhumanity to man when his father is murdered before his own eyes over a matter of being a descendant of Seth instead that of Cain. As an adult, he is a hardened man, sick of the world's injustices and is morally bound to the Creator and his family. He does just about anything to serve his lord and protect his family, even if that means dispatching foes in the Maximus Decimus Meridius style. Receiving visions of death and destruction, Noah concludes that the Creator intends to destroy the world and thus embarks on his mission.Through time and further pressing matters, Noah's loyalty shifts from that of his family to that of the almighty. In true Aronofsky style, Noah becomes obsessed with his goal. His visions turn to reality—in one particular scene, he witnesses a village of people literally turn into monsters as they rape women and eat animals raw. He fails to see his family as people, but rather as the creatures he bounds inside his ark. He even goes so far as to letting an innocent girl be trampled to death and threatens the wellbeing of his future grandchildren. Like with his other characters, Aronofsky puts us in the front row seat of an individual losing his touch on reality and slipping into madness. This psychological case study is more than a good enough reason to go see Noah. Russell Crowe dismisses much of his past tendency of playing Maximus and gives us an understandable yet unique character. He knows how to deliver a fierce performance on screen and his work here is more than exceptional. His physical transformation is just as demanding and compelling. Jennifer Connelly stands by Crowe's side again as his wife Naameh. While she has a fair amount of screen time, I cannot say that she really gives much of a character. She is a good actress and can perform emotions well, but that is all she does in this movie. She cries. She weeps. She cries some more. She actually cries a lot in this movie. Her character has no growth for development, unlike Noah. Emma Watson as Ila and Logan Lerman as Ham have opportunities to flourish as a young, lovely couple caught up in a violent and mad world. They do fine in this regard. I admit I am partial to Watson. After all, she has played Hermione Granger for eight movies. Ray Winstone and Anthony Hopkins take some steps back as caricatures—Winstone as the bad guy and Hopkins as the wise old man. Both have more less been typecast in these sort of roles and it benefits them. Aronofsky also gives us a place where mythical beings and supernatural powers reside. Angels trapped in stone bodies known as the Watchers walk among men and are both feared and slain. Elder men of the descendants of Seth bear abilities to vanquish enemies and cure the infirm. The fantasy elements present more than enough fun for moviegoers that relish big-budget CG flicks. Some visual effects though are a bit off. The animals arriving at the ark are very unrealistic looking. I read in an article that this was the most challenging part for the Visual Effects team to finish at Industrial Light and Magic. I applaud them though for at least making this sequence possible. In comparison, the ark, the flood, the water effects, and the Watchers are very impressive—I think that the designs of the Watchers were inspired from the Rockbiter from the movie The Never Ending Story. Aronofsky's trademark hip-hop montage is my personal favorite technique used in the film. With the combination of CG, still images, and video, the progression of time develops into an intriguing method to tell how the world was created and how it has evolved. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is gritty and beautiful. His choice of hand-held camera during the action and scenes of peril builds intensity while the slow steadi-cam shots create a sublime sensation of calmness. Clint Mansell's score is haunting enough to send shivers down listener's spines— encompassing all the emotions together that the film has to offer. The final thing that has to be said about Noah is its message. It is not about fact or Scripture. It is a moral tale on a how far a man is willing to go to serve a higher power—just like Abraham with his son Isaac. Rating: 8/10",Noah
122,Carycomic,"Cecil B. DeMille, himself, would give this two thumbs down.",1,30 March 2014,"Because even the most outlandishly embellished of his sword-and-sandal Bible epics was still well-acted without being over-acted...like Russell Crowe did in this movie. And the script as written by Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel definitely did _not_ help matters.I am not as frequent a church-goer as my mother (who persuaded me to go see this with her, earlier tonight). But, one thing we both agreed on was that this movie was ""too way out!"" And, that is most definitely _not_ a good thing!I mean; what were Aronofsky and Handel trying to achieve here? Some kind of cross between ultra-orthodox Judaism and New Age environmentalism? Is that why he turned Noah into a fatalistic vegetarian cynic? Well, I _almost_ hate to break this to you, Darren and Ari. But, if that was your vision, then you better get yourselves some prescription glasses. Because this movie was more like _needless revision_!* Especially, the parts where Noah refused to give his two younger sons wives, and then tried to kill his oldest son's twin daughters!!FYI, everyone else: most versions of the Bible agree that Noah's sons were already married when the Flood started. And all three daughters-in-law were _welcomed_ aboard the Ark.So, do yourselves a favor, people. Boycott this movie while it's still in theaters. Then, permanently boycott renting it on DVD, and/or watching it on regular TV. Because, if I ever wondered before whether I was missing something by not watching THE WRESTLER, THE BLACK SWAN, or THE FOUNTAIN, I can now safely say:""No, I was not!!!"" *A la the second STAR TREK reboot I unapologetically refer to as THE WRATH OF RET-CON.",Noah
123,ersinkdotcom,Russell Crowe brings Biblical character of 'Noah' to life on the big-screen,8,9 April 2014,"For over a century now, Hollywood has been obsessed with Biblical epics. Blockbuster filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille's fortune was partially built on not one but two different versions of ""The Ten Commandments."" Let's not forget box office hits like ""Ben-Hur"" and Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ."" ""Noah"" is the latest in the line of Tinseltown takes on God's Holy Word.I would imagine almost everyone knows the tale of Noah as it is told in Genesis Chapter 6 through 10 of the Bible. God tells Noah he is going to destroy the world through a flood because of how evil mankind has become. He instructs him to build an ark, which will hold two of every animal and the man's family. God floods the Earth for forty days and forty nights. Noah, his family, and the animals are left to re-populate the planet after it's all said and done.Let's be honest. No story ever brought to life on the big screen about the Bible has ever been 100% accurate. ""The Ten Commandments"" added all sorts of little side-stories to up the human drama. ""Jesus of Nazareth"" fills in gaps left open in the scriptures for interpretation. Director Darren Aronofsky does the same with ""Noah"" and adds it to a growing list of controversial-yet-successful religiously-based films.I found ""Noah"" to be an entertaining and action-packed re-telling of the Biblical tale. Did Co-Writer/Director Aronofsky add things to it and fill in some gaps along the way? He sure did. However, I don't think he stepped over the line into the region of irreverence or blasphemy. Aronofsky captures the essence of the story even if he does tend to add some ideas of his own to it as well.Yes, there are rock monsters called Watchers that help Noah build the ark. They are fallen angels God banished to the Earth and cursed. They are looking for redemption and want to help Noah do the Will of the Creator to gain the Almighty's forgiveness. What's wrong with that? It doesn't try to change the main gist of the story. There are verses in the Bible that talk about fallen angels living on the earth at that time.Another complaint I've heard is that God wants to destroy the Earth because man has used up its natural resources and abused the animals. Many conservatives see this as the filmmaker pushing his own agenda and propaganda by making God and Noah into hippy environmentalists. However, it's made very clear in the movie that this isn't the only reason the Creator wants to kill off humanity. Noah takes a trip into the city and bears witness to all sorts of violence and degradation.There are also those troubled over the fact that Noah loses his mind and misreads God's messages. I really don't see how this is that far off from the Noah of the Bible. He was not perfect by any means. The Bible makes it very clear that he was a drunkard and fornicator. I found Russell Crowe's portrayal of Noah to be spot-on and showed the humanity and flaws in the Biblical hero many of us grew up hearing about in Sunday School class.""Noah"" is rated PG-13 for violence, disturbing images and brief suggestive content. I would imagine that scenes of people drowning and dying would be considered disturbing. There are two scenes of kissing and a tiny bit of sensuality, but no nudity to be found. People do battle each other and the rock monsters annihilate crowds of people trying to get on the ark when the rains come.""Noah"" might take some artistic license religious groups might find offensive. I prefer to look at the movie as an opportunity to get people talking about the Bible. As a Christian, I hope Darren Aronofsky's film is giving audiences a reason to think about God, faith, the modern plight of man, and what their greater purpose or calling in life might be.",Noah
124,Christian_Dimartino,The boat that rocked,9,29 March 2014,"It's been four long years since Darren Aronofsky directed a movie, and I must say that waiting for one of your favorite directors to return isn't an easy thing to do. I can only imagine how Terrence Malick fans felt when he took a twenty year break between Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line. After waiting long enough, it comes to a point where you don't care what movie the director brings, as long as they return. Aronofsky has returned with Noah, and I'm glad. Aronofskys last film was Black Swan. Remember? That sexy, wild and hypnotic psycho-sexual thriller that won Natalie Portman an Oscar? Yeah, of course you do. How could you forget it? Let's just say, Aronofsky left on a high note(it's his best movie). And what I've learned is that once a director makes something special, it's expected every time. So, how does Noah rank? Well, it's not as good as his great films, like Black Swan, Requiem For a Dream, and The Wrestler. But it's more ambitious than any of those, and it's ambitious enough to make it special. The last time he tried a movie like this was The Fountain, a movie that die-hards like myself enjoyed, but that's it. It had a lot of flaws. Noah also makes an occasional stumble, but it's still good. Basically, Aronofsky takes the tale of Noah (played to perfection by Russell Crowe, in his best performance in a while), and adds his own story lines to it. A risky move, but one that works. I watched Noah as a movie, not from the biblical standpoint. From the biblical standpoint, it's way off. But the movie is entertaining. The visual effects are spectacular and the acting, particularly from Crowe and Ray Winstone as the villain, is dead on. Also, there are nearly too many powerful moments.Not everyone is going to enjoy Noah, but that's OK. I thing Aronofsky knew that going in. He's a man with a vision, and not everyone likes his vision. He has a strange way of telling stories. I went along with his vision and had a hell of a time. It falls short of greatness, but it lands into the damn good category. If Noah was trimmed and a little more faithful to the source material, then it would've been better. I guess there is one thing to gather here: if you give a visionary filmmaker four years and a zillion dollars, then something good will come out of it. And that is the case with Noah. It's not as great as I hoped, but it's good enough. A-",Noah
125,lark40,epic biblical story of Noah proportions,8,9 April 2014,well I gave this film 8/10 as the story which has been told through people going to school gets the big screen outing with Russell Crowe in the lead role he is mister dependable in this epic story of biblical proportions in this film he comes a cross as like in in gladiator the hero this film but brings his charisma to his role at the beginning of life where man came were Kane ABLE SETH. Kane beats ABLE brings evil into the world then Seth is the good guy who Noah comes from but Noah gets a warning to save animals as he figures out that animals are good people who are corrupt the creator wants new life to have no evil left in the world gave people a choice in life and people abused his world he trusted man with his creation but people chose opposite but gave NOAH his reason for making the ark well what action and special effects to make this kind of story the rock keepers of the world are kind off like the trees in LORD OF THE RINGS protecting in genesis mentions they were giants but this film kind of makes references to these to help Noah and the animals and protect the Ark and so the battles for good and evil the film is slightly slow in places to make sure the story is told properly the Anthony Hopkins is here like Gandalf guiding his family the special effects are very good Emily Watson she is a great in here role she bring a vulnerability to here role as Noah daughter and I'm not giving here story away but the there a mini documentary of how the universe and life was created in 3mins that fun but weird but Noah cares about his family. his boys went to help the good but Noah only wants what is best their is a theme here that we are ruining the beauty full world we live in by the evil and using the earths resources up and that family is were to start rebuilding the world we live before its to late if we use up earth we will destroy life but it will be reborn again the creator gave us a choice and we are abusing it great film if people listen to the themes we can save our planet people abused them its feels like oblivion with bleak landscapes people should realize what a beauty full world we live in Ray Winston playing able he is very good a playing the evil Kane in this movie he reminds me of the MICKY OROURKE IN Iron Man 2,Noah
126,Shopaholic35,I expected so much more from this movie.,6,29 December 2015,"Gotta say, this movie was pretty darn corny. From the first title sequence I knew something was off and that I may potentially feel let down at the end of this movie. Now I'm not really religious but the whole thing felt like I was sitting in a bible study class or something. I still don't really understand what the heck the creation of the earth has to do with Noah and his ark anyway. The movie just comes off as spiteful and a bit ""do as your told or i'll smite you"". It's all too confusing and unbelievable to me as no matter how many times the earth has been cleansed the sinners keep returning.Even though it wasn't particularly well executed it wasn't too bad. I still found it entertaining and in some parts comical, even if it wasn't meant to be. The one thing that was truly unforgivable were the special effects. They were absolutely terrible. I'm pretty sure about ninety percent of this movie was filmed in front of a green screen and it really shows. So it's bad but watchable.",Noah
127,face-819-933726,Taken as a fantasy action piece it's a fun little ride.,7,5 July 2014,"This is a really nice piece of fantasy, and a lot of attempts to make things easier to explain the little details that just don't mesh. I really enjoyed the idea that (and come on this movie can not be spoiled it has been told) once the ark comes to rest there would not be any wood to build homes with so they would use that and there explains no ark. Couple little things though: The remaining humans come off the ark with agrarian skills, and knowledge. Why instead of growing the trees does the all mighty not just grow them an ark? Time in this movie is like the water that runs across the globe meandering here and there in what has to be days, not years (the kids never get older during that time) Last one I have to point out, the story plays off evolution as something that happens in a day, but the planet was spinning, (what unit was that measured in) oh, and they come so close to the man ape question it is kind of painful. Now you take all of that out of this movie, and you have a really great popcorn flick that anyone who likes fantasy action with a kind of alternate earth like Mordor kind of feeling will love. The Angel/Helper/Rockmen creatures are really nicely blended in for the most part, and the ark itself which strangely takes very little of the surrounding forest to build is a marvel in it's construction that would never work, shaped that way it could only ever sink, there was not even any consideration for buoyancy, or balance. Enough picking apart the details, or I would have to go on about little green screen errors. I really ended up Enjoying myself watching most of this movie, the fantasy that there was an advanced civilization that covered every inch of land, who were all wiped out, and the evidence some how washed away, and the fact that all the animals came way more than 2 by 2, but no one ever points out that they came from nowhere because the cities had taken everything. Sorry there I go again. To make it simple this movie is like 10,000 BC, (only not supposed to be as far back somehow...) in the liberties that are taken with history, and proof. My last question, I have to ask though is how did any girls ever grow to have children in that world? They were all just traded for food, so where did all the guys come from? So yes I do recommend this as a piece of fluff that you can enjoy for the fantasy that it is, and you will be rewarded with some great effects, and a decent story acted by a top notch cast. Your call, but that's how I call it.Jesse of www.Jesse.ca",Noah
128,griffolyon12,This Isn't Your Dad's Biblical Epic,6,30 March 2014,"You know the story, you know how it goes, but what you really want to know is whether or not director Darren Aronofsky's big screen adaptation of Noah is any good. Well, if it were a piece of mythological fiction, it might find some audience, but as a far from theologically sound depiction of what actually happened, Noah just doesn't quite cut it. There were many intriguing ideas on display here, such as the look and feel of the pre-flood Earth, driving home that this is not Cecil B. Demille's vision of the Old Testament, but the film quickly comes unraveled in a lot of made up hokum. Here's the thing, the original text is relatively short, and there is a far amount of guesswork that Aronofsky and his crew had to do in order to realize this story, but when they start changing and adding in things that were not in the text merely to suit their artistic needs, that's when I have a problem. Sure, the six-armed stone giants might have been cool looking, but were they necessary, or theologically accurate? Similarly, the idea that Noah interprets God's vision to think that all of mankind's blood line should end, therefore he refuses his sons to take wives, save for one, thinking his daughter-in-law is barren, contradicts everything you read in the original Noah story. Every few lines in the bible it says that Noah, his wife, his sons, and his sons' wives, all boarded the ark because God saw Noah as righteous, therefore him and his bloodline, his family, found favor. They were to be fruitful and multiply.Bottom line, is that there is still a great film about Noah and his ark out there waiting to be made, but this is not it. While the acting is good, and the cinematography and special effects are stunning, especially all of the time lapse photography utilized to show the creation of the Earth, the film just took too many liberties and fails to be respectful to those who believe in this story. As a well made, visually stunning film, I can appreciate the craft on display here as a fellow filmmaker, but only that.I give Noah a 6 out of 10!",Noah
129,Laakbaar,"""I have set my rainbow in the clouds""",8,13 April 2014,"I rather enjoyed this movie. I liked the director's approach: let's imagine that the Creator existed and that the Noah story actually happened. What would it have looked like? I've never really been able to visualize two of every creature on a vessel, but this movie dares to imagine what that might have looked like. Quite spectacular.There were a few other spectacular scenes. The amoral chaos in the camp; the screaming masses on the mountain; the angels' ascension into heaven.Some of the imaginings went a little too far, I suppose. The bold decision to show the fallen angels (the biblical Nephelim?) as large, um, Transformer-like rock monsters was quite off-putting -- at first. But I eventually accepted it as part of the reimagining. It fit into the plot because it explained how the Ark got built even though the task would have been beyond Noah and his family. Still, I would have preferred the angels to have been shown in a different form.I saw the movie with two Christians. They enjoyed the movie (or at least they were willing to sit through it), but I think were somewhat dismissive about the nonbiblical reimaginings. I didn't feel the same way. For me, the Noah fable was brought to life in a way that gave it new meaning and deserves respect. I didn't mind the creative additions to the story. The biblical and Greek stories have deep and ancient roots in our culture, but they can be reimagined for a modern audience. We demand more from our storytellers now.I was really moved at several points. To me, that's always an important aspect of a good movie. The acting here was very, very good. The script was good. Intelligent, even. I liked the environmental twist to the story and to the covenant. This spoke to me, as it would to anyone in our polluted, crowded world. Noah, will you be able to save our planet once again?I knew Crowe and Hopkins would be fantastic, but so were Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. The hair was standing up on the back of my neck when Naameh confronted Noah about his new interpretation of the Creator's will. Another scene that really moved me was Noah's comforting of Ila when she realised that her barrenness made her unsuitable as a mate for Shem. Apparently there is room in creation for those who do not procreate. Powerful stuff. It was so perfect that it was Ila who comforted Noah at the end by explaining why he had not failed in his divine, monumental mission. There were a few other great scenes, too many now for me to list here.The movie is actually quite entertaining. It was a long movie (135 minutes) but I only looked at my watch twice near the end.I've read a few of the negative reviews, but they don't reflect my experience. If you click through to the demographics, you see that the film is polarizing. It gets a lot of 1s and 10s. Many of the negative reviews are cynical and unhelpful. Yes, there were a few plot holes. However, they didn't ruin the film for me and it feels petty to describe them here. Yes, the movie was uncomfortably religious, with constant references to God throughout. Even though I am no longer a believer at all, I can suspend my disbelief for a good film.The movie's true value (as rated by the unpolarised) is shown by the bell curve on the chart. It's about 7 right now, but I think 8 is more accurate. I'd give it a 9 because of the emotional impact it had on me. But I'm knocking that back down to 8 because of the stone monsters.",Noah
130,nicholls_les,Absolute Travesty,1,5 January 2018,"I wonder what people would think if they went to watch a movie based on their favorite book only to find that everything about it had been changed to the point of absurdity.
The next Superman or Batman or Tarzan or Bond movie that comes out should maybe follow the lead of this movie and portray them all in a way that no one who knows the stories would recognize them.
That is what the producers of this so called movie have done. If I could have given no stars or a minus I would have because it changes the story line and reduces the characters to polar opposites of the way they were described in the book.
I know many movies will have artistic license but they rarely change everything.
Noah is portrayed as a confused, violent mad man who will happily kill anyone who stands in the way of his ideas, he will even kill babies, yet the Bible describes him as a righteous man, it says he was faultless among his contemporaries. It was not his decisions that he carried out but his Gods.
The Bible refers to the world being full of violence and that fallen Angels had come to earth having sexual relations with women who then had offspring that were themselves violent.These were called Nephilim and they were Giants but not big weird looking stone creatures.
The Bible also says that eight persons were saved in the Ark and these were Noah, his three sons and their respective wives. By the time the Ark was built they would have all been adults, but in this movie there is one girlfriend of Shem and a girl Ham wants to take on the Ark is left to die by his psychotic Father.
And then we find Tubal Kane manages to get on board the Ark and we find out that Noah wants to destroy all humans even though in the Bible God tells him the Ark is too preserve life. Noah also refuses anyone else onto the Ark even though the Bible says he preached to people for many years and the Ark was more than big enough for many people. The only reason no one else went into the Ark was because they were wicked and thought Noah was mad.
In this movie we see crowds of men storming the Ark and being beaten off by giant stone creatures that look like bad caricatures of the thing form the fantastic four.
Also as others have said God himself barely gets a mention in the entire movie.Anther point that annoyed me was that apparently it was only white people who lived back then and only white people who got onto the Ark, ye the Bible lists genealogies that show that for example Ham's descendants became the people of early Egypt and Africa so you would expect that either Noah's family was dark skinned and the wives were lighter skinned or the other way around, but certainly not all white with straight hair.",Noah
131,cinematic_aficionado,Shallow,4,24 April 2014,"Whether one is religious or not, the flood story in the Bible remains one of the most significant in world literature. When you decide to make a movie about this narrative, why on earth would you disregard the story and 'creatively recreate it'. Had they made Noah living in the contemporary world, it would have been a different consideration altogether.Noah appears as an obsessive maniac, a control freak who is assisted by lava robots in building an ark and of course during this process we observe his children's sexual frustrations as well as an unwanted intruder in the ark. The story needs no further commentary to signify how appallingly poor it was.Strong foundational story, A-list cast and high budget but you decide to mess with a much loved story and you have an absolute flop. Some of the flood scenes were impressive but highly insufficient to alter this utterly hollow experience.",Noah
132,billygoat1071,Tale of Human Tyranny,6,12 June 2014,"Noah tends to bring the well known biblical story into an epic scale. This idea may involve a lot of stretching, the original story is simply about a man's obedience to his creator, and whatever it is changed here other than the big action set pieces and CGI creatures is its theme of misanthropy. It can be quite interesting when it focuses to that part, but it suddenly gets out of hand in the second half when it sends the protagonist to the ultimate test. The more new ideas this movie shows, the peculiar the vision becomes. And to that point Noah becomes strangely fascinating, even when the narrative could get a little messy.The central message of this version goes to the aspect of humanity's worthy of existing. It deeply portrays their arrogance and mischief like they are the real villains of this world; that even the fallen angels, who are responsible of their corruption, end becoming their victims and decided to defend the good guys. The first half is quite compelling for giving us the perspective of the only good living people protecting themselves from the dark side of humanity. The second half goes to the riskier challenge of Noah's obedience, and that's when it becomes a little shaky because its sudden shift into a psychological thriller diminished the subtext of human enlightenment and complex divine relationship. The guilt and redemption segment in the end never really felt natural with that contrivance.It's a waste of an intriguing opportunity, but it still succeeds at being an epic. While the film stays true to its grand blockbuster tone, it still manages to put whimsical images at the backstories and the action. Director Darren Aronofsky shoots those marvelous landscapes and set pieces as a visual feast. Its technical ambition awkwardly gains more accomplishments than its larger thematic potential. The film scatters a lot of other weird ideas to the story, but they were eventually just hanging along. It was the acting that helped to make it at least somehow compelling. The performances of Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Ray Winstone gave the real human gravitas to the characters which was lost in the script to the second half. Crowe also gets to calm a little of Noah's random transformation into Jack Torrance.Noah works as a fantasy blockbuster, with all the good vs. evil struck during the humongous battles, but that's it. There might be a sympathy towards the error of human beings, but in the end it jumps right back at the black-and-white morality. The director did realize his view on Noah as a man with the ""survivor's guilt"", the disappointment is the philosophy beneath his devoted struggles just left out shallow. It only goes faithful to its cynicism. While that isn't the true center of the original biblical story, I personally still got the curiosity. It's a spectacular new vision, if not a little silly. The silliness could have passed if the thematic building gets more work. For now, it's a nicely done blockbuster.",Noah
133,Rickting,A decent biblical epic with no rewatchability,6,10 December 2014,"This is an absolutely bonkers retelling of Noah's Ark. However, it's not a straight adaptation. This is someone's interpretation of the story and the absence of God, dark tone and rock monsters may raise some eyebrows. It's pretty much the makers of the film interpreting the story and telling it their way with mixed results. Remember the books of Noah's Ark you used to read when young, with the boat, colourful animals in pairs and a rainbow at the end? This is absolutely nothing like that. This dark, gritty biblical epic wrapped up in a Christopher Nolan style thriller certainly won't do a Gladiator and kick start a trend of modern biblical epics. It's far too long and is just plain dull a lot of the time. It is absolutely bonkers and lacks a lot of watchability, since not a lot is even going on much of the time. The script is genuinely awful. With awkward lines, heaps of exposition and a lot of boring conversation, this won't turn any heads at the academy for screen writing achievements. Overall, the harsh truth is that it's badly written.The acting is all around good. It's strange to see Hermione in this, but Emma Watson is an acting highlight. Anthony Hopkins and Jennifer Connolly are good as well, although both Russell Crowe and Logan Lerman are a bit too understated. Since it's Darren Aronofsky, this is a well made film and his first go with a big budget was ultimately a success. The film uses images in an interesting way and has some great cinematography. The CGI actually looks decent. The filmmakers are to be admired for telling the story in such an audacious way and Noah is ultimately a fairly bold movie. It will offend plenty of people, but at least it's a bit different and unpredictable. It adds a few unexpected dimensions to the story as well. This is an OK movie overall. It's not something I'd ever watch again because it's just not a hugely enjoyable film, but it's one you may well admire in a funny sort of way. In a nutshell, this is what would happen if Roland Emmerich made a biblical epic, only better than that.6/10",Noah
134,dilipbts,Noah,7,29 July 2020,"Expecting very little. Actually Noah was nowhere near as bad as heard, and while very flawed and by far the worst film of Darren Aronofsky(with his others ranging from very good to outstanding) it did have some impressive things. On the most part the film is brilliant visually, the barren apocalyptic landscapes and later more colourful ones were really striking and the cinematography has a sweeping yet somewhat surrealistic effect. The opening and creation sequences were beautifully done with the latter quite harrowing without being too heavy-handed, and the flood scene was intense and jaw-dropping in spectacle.",Noah
135,bheadher,Huh...?,5,12 October 2016,"...And just what are the giant rock creatures supposed to be???I actually thought it pretty cool that this movie was being shown on TV so soon...until I started watching it. I found it about an hour after it started, so I gave it a few minutes to grab me...It didn't happen. I like Russel Crowe, but he did not save this movie by being in it...and five minutes in I saw the rock creatures...if I started to give it a fair try, the rock guys did me in.I simply cannot say something nice where there is nothing nice about it...The acting is subdued, at least, and utterly boring at best. For having some high ranked actors in it, the delivery of just about all characters was just lost. Even Anthony Hopkins was mediocre, and I love all his other movies.So the bottom line is, why tell a Bible story as something else?",Noah
136,TheSquiss,"A loud, pointless mess that will have God scratching his head.",1,21 April 2014,"No, no, no, no, NO! Right, if you have any Christian faith, if you've read the Bible, hell, if you have even the slightest knowledge of Noah and his escapades with the flood and animals, wipe them from your mind. Better still, take your Bible and drop kick it into another dimension. That's clearly what Darren Aronofsky has done.Understand this, Noah has nothing, beyond his name, to do with Biblical epics. Aronofsky can't even bring himself to allow his actors to utter the name 'God', choosing instead to refer to him constantly as 'The Creator.' Overlooking the fact (email me if you want to discuss 'facts') that the story of Noah's ark is, at best, symbolic and at worse, pure fantasy, it is still an important part of Christianity and a significant story in the Bible. So, what's wrong with Noah? The wrong number of animals in the ark, the incorrect number of humans in the ark, either the incorrect number of days at sea in the ark or an unfeasibly quick pregnancy. And then there's the rock monsters, the battles, the sorcery, the shocking use of natural history stock footage Add to that the script, the direction, the score that has the subtlety of advanced gonorrhea, and the acting.Oh, and don't get me started on the armadillo dog!Forget about the nice things I said about Emma Watson in my review for The Perks of Being a Wallflower. She is a terrible actress who, just occasionally, has a happy accident. No such luck here. At least she's in good company in Noah.Noah is Aronofsky's impression of a Bible story rewritten by Tolkien on acid and hashed up by Michael Bay. It is not of this world or any Bible I'm aware of. Without doubt, Noah is the worst film I've endured so far this year and it's going to take some beating, although Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction may have something to say about that. Still, it's a pity the Razzies aren't in June. I'd predict at least four wins.And if you need another reason not to part with money for this long, loud, pointless mess, it ends with Noah instructing his family to commit incest! God, if he, she or it exists is most certainly scratching his, her or its head in bemusement.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Noah
137,RevRonster,Better than I thought...,8,25 September 2014,"It's hard to make a religious film not come off as preachy and it's hard to not make them look poorly written (sorry, Christian film industry, you just don't employ very good writers). However, Darren Aronofsky helmed a film that was able to make the religious tale of Noah and the Great Flood and made it moving and poignant.While the trailers made the film seem like Noah was getting the superhero treatment, the final product was an expertly crafted film that weaves great themes into very moving emotional struggles and coated onto a heap of excitement when the rains start. Additionally, the film has an unbelievable cast that is delivering like nobody's business. Most notably from Ray Winstone (anyone else think he has an awesome voice?) and Russell Crowe as Noah.The weight and the burden of being not only the zookeeper to two of each animal on the face of the planet but being one of the only people to escape God's pouting wrath as body after body slams against the ark as the water levels rise was incredible to watch. You can feel the trouble he has to endure, the anguish he must live with, and the strength of his conviction to do what he has been asked to do. Crowe was really able to bring to life a character that has, until now, been pretty much a figure in a single archaic book and many, many children's easy readers.I'm not a religious man but I can respect when a religious tale refrains from being preachy and self-righteous. Instead, ""Noah"" came off as a noble and difficult tale about a man asked to do the impossible and did so only with his faith and strength of his convictions.Hello, buddy! My name is Rev.

138,davidgee,Taking liberties with The Book,4,9 April 2014,"Where is Cecil B. De Mille when you need him? It ought not to be possible to make a dull movie out of the story of Noah and the Ark, but Darren Aronofsky has managed to do just that. This leaden, plodding epic is a real dog's breakfast. The script is unremittingly grim, the music relentlessly dour.The Bible tells us that ""God spake unto Noah""; He spoke very vividly to Charlton Heston in De Mille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. In this version God has a non-speaking role; Noah (Russell Crowe) gets his orders via visions of a drowning world and the appearance of miracles. The Bible mentions that there were ""giants"" in the world at the time; this version recreates them as a cross between today's Transformers and the Golem monsters of Hebrew folklore - they do most of the labouring jobs and also fight off the Wicked People who, despite being armed with some very medieval weapons, are destined to perish in the Flood.. Taking further liberties with The Book, the writer/director gives Noah's three sons only one wife between them, which makes for an eyebrow-raising Mystery about how the post-Flood world is going to be repopulated. One of the sons of Noah is called Ham, although ham could also be the word that applies to Ray Winstone's performance as the leader of the Wicked People, unnamed in the Bible and here given a role to rival Noah's. Russell Crowe is a commandingly stern presence, a believable if unlikeable patriarch. Jennifer Connelly looks very modern as Mrs Noah, and their sons, like the Giants and the Wicked People, seem to belong more to Middle Earth than to the time before Abraham. Anthony Hopkins has a thankless cameo as Methuselah, Noah's grandpa, here gifted with miraculous powers to rival God's.God is not called God in this version; He's called The Creator - perhaps in a nod to the Creationists in America's Bible Belt. But when Noah recounts the story of Creation to his family, the accompanying flashback looks more than a little Evolutionary. Trying not to offend people of different faiths, Aronofsky has probably managed to offend them all. GLADIATOR was a thrilling revamp of themes from BEN HUR. This revamp of the many takes on the story of the Ark, despite the addition of Giants and Ray Winstone and state-of-the-art CGI, is anything but thrilling.",Noah
139,judywalker2,"interesting at first, then silly",5,31 March 2014,"I went to see this movie as a Russell Crowe an Jennifer Connelly fan but also because it got some interestingly good reviews; especially concerning its environmental message which made me think that it would not be overly religious. At first I was captured by the re-imagining of the biblical story of Noah. It was definitely an interesting take, industrialism versus farming, living off of the land. Russell Crowe's performance was on point and Jennifer Connelly always seems to hold her own and they work well together. The supporting cast was also good especially Anthony Hopkins who I just love. His entire performance made me smile through a very heavy film. But then just as I thought they would be getting to something good, they messed up. Suddenly religious silliness reared its ugly head. I wanted to just laugh all the way through the last half of the movie. For example, these may be spoilers so I warn you now: Noah's wife invents the home pregnancy test, Noah becomes a wine head. Too bad it could have really been a movie that people would talk about but I doubt they will.",Noah
140,mmthos,DON'T CITE THIS AS SCRIPTURE,5,18 August 2021,"CGI. Either you love it or hate it. I hate it, but there's certainly a lot here for lovers of it to love: Noah's Ark full of nothing but virtual animals, adrift on a stormy, never-ending sea.So we move on to the real-life segments with real-live actors. As the biblical account is only 3 chapters, at over 2 hours and a quarter I knew to expect it to be fleshed out, but adding a crisis of faith and an intractable determination that the human race shall not survive in the post-flood world creates a Noah (Russell Crowe) that is antithetical to the one of the Bible, so don't expect fidelity to scripture, if that matters to you. Writer director Aronovsky seems to be presenting him as a composite of several great men of the tribe of Israel in service to God. The Watchers are also a fabrication, and seem to be included as ancient Transformer-type giants for fans of that type of thing. Also, there are no human stowaways on the Ark in the original account. Emma Watson's character is only mentioned in passing as Shem's nameless wife in the Bible, but fleshed out here as essential to opposing Noah's pessimism and bring him into The Light. And, though not the biblical original, Crowe's (Aronovsky's) Noah is played as a righteous man, true to his own code. Unfortunately, a lot of the rest of the mundane script is not up to the film's epic ambitions.And I'm left wondering: was that snakeskin arm-wrap really a thing in ancient times? To my knowledge, its not in the Bible,Not up to expectations.",Noah
141,latinfineart,Unbelievably poor film. Wow. I cannot describe how much it lacked entertainment.,1,18 April 2014,"I will start by saying I am a fan of Russell Crowe. I find him charming. He was probably the saving grace of this fiasco of a film. This film did not go anywhere. The script was poor, and the story line was equally poor. Not sure why Hollywood cannot do better than this. It was a really substandard effort. The story was pure silliness. I did not need it to be based on the bible, but this was such a stretch. It was not really all that credible, nor plausible. A disappointing effort, to say the least. They can do better than this. I could do better than this. Your child could have done better than this. Poorly directed by a very good director. It seems to have gotten away from him. Maybe it was too big a production? Maybe it was the Noah character taking it upon himself to be the sole messenger of God? Something got under my skin, and prevented me from getting any enjoyment out of this turkey of a film. It was painful to sit through, and I ended up leaving before it ended. I was thankful I did that, based on what most of my friends told me.",Noah
142,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Lord Of The Flood,2,28 March 2014,"If you think building a giant boat that will protect a few selected humans from God's forty day/forty night torrent, or the pairing up of every animal, including reptiles, is detailed that much in director Darren Aronofsky's fantastical epic, think again All these important elements occur as quickly as falling raindrops Thanks to giant spiderlike rock trolls – formerly fallen angels who have risen from the Earth – constructing the Ark is easy enough. The real task is Noah himself... will he ever come to his senses? Figuring God must want all humans dead, eventually, Russell Crowe's bearded prophet becomes more of a tormented villain than a Biblical icon, and as doggone stubborn as two mules put together.Once the Ark is built, and the Trolls have battled hordes of evil men wanting a free ride, and the floods have taken over completely, scenes where Noah's vengeful middle child is tempted by a nefarious stowaway provides the only suspense. Meanwhile, the best visual shows Creation as Noah tells the story around a cozy on-deck fire This is about the only time dad gets any respect from his family, all on the verge of mutiny, and then some. While it's understandable that poetic license must be taken when basing an entire motion picture from a surprisingly few amount of verses, it seems Aronofsky's either making the flood story seem as engagingly far-fetched for Believers as the Bible itself is to Non-Believers, or perhaps he simply wanted to direct a big budget disaster film for everyone, no matter what their religion or lack of. But NOAH is much too slow and brooding for its own goodWhat we can use right now is some old school Charlton Heston: over-the-top or not, that man delivered!",Noah
143,bbickley13-921-58664,Bibical...but not Epic.,7,29 March 2014,"It's been a few years since I stop watching the Ten Commandments annually on Easter Sunday, now that broadcast television has change a little. Not that Noah is better than The Ten commandments but it's definitely a movie I could start a new tradition with.This film was more incline to what I though the movie Son of God was going to be like. I felt Son of God was more for religious types as it tended to be very preachy. Noah on the other hand kept in mind that just because a large portion of the world is familiar with the story does not mean they are all Christian. Instead of preaching the story to you like we are in church, Noah just tells you the story like a really good movie should. Russel Crowe did a great acting Job as Noah. Though not his best performance ever, he was able to show us both sides to a coin, as a man whose devotion to God and his plan is so strong that in makes him look insane to even those close to him , but he keeps on because he has faith in his creator, and he was able to do all that without making it seem like I'm back in Sunday school. His acting was help by his ensemble cast. One highlight was Logan Lerman as Ham whose desire for a female companion showed the loop hole in his father's plan from the start. The only thing I did not fully enjoy was the part the fallen angels had in the movie. I was hoping the movie would try to be more non-biblical and a little more down to earth, but the special effects for those spiritual scenes where well done. Darren Aronofsky did a great job bringing this bible story to the big screen, and adding some intensity to Noah that's no where near Black Swan, but maybe somewhere under the Wrestler. Highly recommend",Noah
144,MovieHoliks,A Marginal Thumbs-up,6,4 May 2015,"It seems that since 2004's huge worldwide success, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"", biblical epics are here again. Since then, there has been ""The Nativity"", History Channel's ""The Bible"" series they are apparently releasing each chunk in theaters, as well as last year's remake of ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"". Whether or not you're a believer, I think you can still enjoy the great story of Noah, the ark and the great flood. The FX in this big screen treatment I'd say are pretty first rate, Darren Aronofsky's direction is stellar as usual, and we have a reunion of the two stars of Ron Howard's Oscar-winning 2001 film, ""A Beautiful Mind""- Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly- which for me was in many ways the highlight of this. As usual, Crowe gives a powerful performance, treating the character of Noah as a man obsessed, at many times at the expense of his family. Ray Winstone is given the role of the film's main villain, sort of the human metaphor for all the evil in the world the flood attempts to extinguish. I really don't think we needed this character, to be honest, And the ""Watchers"" I think they were called??- at first I was like WTF?? LOL But after awhile, you almost find yourself feeling a little affections for them.",Noah
145,Al_The_Strange,Noah Review,9,28 March 2014,"We all know the tale; it's been told, parodied, and stereotyped to the point where the original context can get lost in the flood of pop culture. In this modern telling of the story of Noah's Ark, the film definitely emphasizes the mythic aspects to deliver a larger-than-life spectacle. As expected, you will see fantastic visions of creation and death, hoards of animals entering the Ark, the the deluge sweeping over the Earth. What you may not expect is that the film also includes a massive army of barbaric hoards clashing with fallen angels, flashes of magic and mysticism, twists in morality that challenges Noah's heroics, and an overall tone that's grim, brutal, and somber. And yet, despite so many liberties, it still captures the essence of the story in its own unique way.The film is somewhat split in half. The first half contains all the big-scale setpieces, containing plenty of special effects and scenes of war. Once the flood commences and the big battle ends, the film settles down and becomes a brooding drama. Pacing becomes herky-jerky because of this; audiences wanting action might enjoy the first half and get bored by the end, while others may feel the opposite. The overall tone is very grim, and the film doesn't shy away from showing the raw brutality of the world of sinners and the struggle for survival. Parts of it will work, parts of it might not; ultimately this movie will be different from person to person, and it will likely be one of the biggest love-it-or-hate-it films of 2014. It will depend on your disposition on the storytelling.This story takes a lot of liberties from the Bible; if it's a word-for-word accurate account you want, the film will disappoint. Some of the changes are purely cosmetic, to give the film a kind of high-fantasy aesthetic (such as the inclusion of The Watchers). Some changes are made to make the plot more convenient. The biggest alterations involve the addition of the descendants of Cain, providing human antagonists for Noah to fight in a big battle, and one central villain to draw out even more drama. One other big change that might upset purists is what's done to Noah and his family; the film contrives a huge drama out of their legacy, going so far as pushing them to odd and amoral directions that truly challenge our notion of what could have happened in this ancient story.All that being said, I felt the liberties with the story were warranted, because the film methodically creates many long threads of conflict and entwines them into one big braid of a plot that gives it momentum and drives the characters to their most logical directions. Without all this drama, the characters really wouldn't have much to do, before or after the big flood. As it is, the film fills itself up with so much conflict that it gives the characters life and minds of their own, and their actions generate some very complex dynamics that ultimately contribute to deeper thematic depth.I think the film's greatest strength is the subtext: the film is loaded with ideas and themes concerning creation, mankind's sin, judgment, mercy, and morality. Most of these ideas are conveyed sublimely through the use of powerful images and punctual dialogue. In the end, we're made to understand on a deeper level exactly why the flood happened, why Noah acts the way he does, why things play out the way they do, and what the implications are. Most of the film's conflicts revolve around the sanctity of creation; the film shows a lot of brutality as the descendants of Cain defile creation, in contrast to Noah who tries his best to preserve it. As the film goes on, themes of environmentalism, industrialization, and resource depletion become very blatant, offering a frightening reflection not only of the past, but also of what could come in the future. The final message, however, is an uplifting one that I always found most elegant: the idea that the end is also the beginning. This is a rather bleak apocalyptic tale, but the film radiates hope by its end.The film is well-crafted with some very incredible photography and editing. There are a number of scenes in the film that are appropriately powerful and moving, thanks to the way it unites key imagery and symbolism with the narrative. Russell Crowe is as good as usual, and does have some great standout scenes. Jennifer Connelly is perfectly compelling in her role, and I was surprised that Emma Watson put on a great performance as well. Everybody else does alright. Writing gets the job done well, but most of the dialogue seemed pretty blunt. This production spares no expense on the real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Some special effects are okay, some were made to look a bit archaic on purpose (namely the Watchers, who are animated in some kind of stop-motion style), and some effects are incredibly brilliant. Clint Mansell's music score is as elegant as ever.The film will not sit well with everybody. Some folks will be bored. Others might be upset that it's not 100% true to the Bible. However, Noah is a film experience I personally valued a lot; its issues didn't really affect me that much, and I grew to admire the story and all it meant on a deeper level. With its blend of action, visual splendor, and compelling storytelling, I felt it was a fairly moving picture. However, this is not an easy movie to casually recommend. You might love it. You might hate it. It'll all depend on your views of the Bible, of director Darren Aronofsky, and of Hollywood and its embellishments. The best I can say is give the movie a try, because this really is a one-of-a-kind epic.4.5/5 (Experience: Very Good | Content: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",Noah
146,Dragonborn64,Hippie Noah,8,26 August 2021,"In Aronofsky's version Noah is an environmentalist who looks at the Earth as an extension of himself, not something to rape & pillage like the other tribe.

But this attempt to re-tell the story is just bad.The first half of the movie is not all bad. It is actually somewhat enjoyable. The dark scenery is sometimes depressing and beautiful at the same time. I did like the watchers. It added a bit of extra to the movie and the fight when Tubal-Cain tried to capture the ark was not bad at all.However, then it went downhill quickly with Noah going more and more nuts and Tubal-Cain, having survived, is subverting Noah's son Ham. Not that Noah did not really bring that upon himself to some extent though. The parts where Noah want to kill his grandchildren and stops in the last minute is just Hollywood soap-opera bullshit. Also, do not get me started about the ridiculous scene where Anthony Hopkins goes berry hunting like some mental retard.Up until about half the movie I did not really understand all the very negative reviews but after having watched through the miserable last half I have to say that I do understand them more. I think the one-star ones are a bit harsh since the movie is often quite beautiful and the acting, despite the crappy script, is quite good, but the lousy script is just destroying the movie.Definitely a disappointment.",Noah
149,room102,Not bad,6,9 October 2015,"While the story is extremely thin, simple and offers almost nothing new (except for the weird ""watchers"" angle), there are some good visuals and a few bits that subliminally connect to other Aronofsky movies and style - mainly the repetition bits (""Pi""/""Reuqiem for a Dream"") and some visuals that reminds me of those from ""The Fountain"".There is a lot of CGI usage and it's pretty uneven. Some CGI are pretty good, others seem pretty unnatural.Good production and good score by Clint Mansell (although not nearly as good as his previous works).P.S.: Watching Emma Watson kissing etc. is just too awkward. I was never a ""Harry Potter"" fan (and actually haven't seen any of the movies), but while she's 24-year old, she looks half her age. I had to check her age, since it looked too uncomfortable.The montage at 1:24 was fantastic. I also like the way they bridged the gap (or paralleled) between the story of creation in the bible and the big bang and evolution. I'm not a Russell Crowe fan, but he's pretty good in his role.The movie was better than I expected. The plot is thin, but it's well made and it hold well its over-2-hours running time.",Noah
150,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,26 September 2014,"7.5/10 I think this is a missed great movie. What I took from it is that Aronofsky had a vision and wanted to do a retelling of this amazing story (fact or fiction aside) in a personal way, but what emerged from the film in the end was just a part of what the director had in mind. The fact is that there is nothing wrong at all with the screenplay nor the movie's tone, it just struggles continuously in trying to be what it was meant to be and succeeds amazingly in parts, but in others it really seems as if what is trying to emerge was pushed back by the studio in favor of a more formulaic or traditional result. This was really what took me out of it, just by looking at the editing you know there is something strange going on. The film was edited by Andrew Weisblum, a great editor who previously worked with Aronosky in films like Black Swan which actually has beautiful editing. Yet here it looks very sloppy at times giving me this strange sensation of a story trying to say something very important but ultimately being driven away from the core of it. Anyways this doesn't result in a failure for Aronosfky, whom ultimately succeeds in giving his message. This movie could have been a colossal failure had it not been in the hands of such brilliant filmmakers. Yes there was this whole issue with the story's development, but there's just no way in which I couldn't have been taken in with the movie on a whole. The actors do a great job at handling and delivering material which could have sounded and looked simply cheesy in a less-talented actor's hands, they are the ones who keep this grounded: highlights are Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly emotionally commanding the screen when they come in. Emma Watson's charisma is just unparalleled, (by the way, it was great to see Connelly and Aronosky reunited). Clint Mansell gives proof once again that he is a genius composer stretching as much as he could the use of two notes in their uttermost power, becoming a kind of chorus to the movie and adding a dramatic depth that could have missed had he not been involved. Anyways, what truly made me enjoy this movie were the visuals: Matthew Libatique is one of my favuorite cinematographers and when he is paired up with the visionary filmaking of Aronofsky the result is out-standingly epic: there is clear influence of The Lord of the Rings trilogy here and it was majestically reworked (but obviously didn't reach its heights, no fault in that anyway). There were true, great cinematic moments in this movie where you clearly felt the power of what the director was aiming for, but failed in delivering because of a missing depth and sweeping emotion to the story. This was a very good movie, but unfortunately it falls short of a great one simply because of moments that do not work, despite the possibility of being it.",Noah
151,scottshak_111,You chose mercy. You chose love!,8,30 March 2014,"Took me back in time. When I had read about Noah's ark for the first time, I had marveled and this flick gave wings to my juvenile imagination. The introduction of fallen angels as 'The Watchers' and Ila gives a new perspective to the story. Visual effects r breath taking, be it be the deluge, the nestling creatures, falling tears from the sky, Noah's dreams or the fight sequences, every bit was drenched in pizazz.Emma Watson is just a delight to watch in Ila's shoes. When she wails and wishes to let the baby stay inside her, it just doesn't go any more melting than that. Jennifer Connelly is equally mesmerizing. Her acting is intense and brings out chokes in your neck, while Russell Crowe's the backbone of the story. He is as charismatic as ever. Ray Winstone slithers in perversion throughout the flick. His man's-meant-to-rule attitude reigns his head. That moment when he defies God and delivers his pep talk, it is the most memorable bit from the flick.Noah's Vision: Those swift moments that pass on the divine word to Noah have been evinced subtly. The emergence of life, mankind's death in deluge whilst animals float towards the ark, land of blood that signifies death, twas like watching poetry breathe!The evolutionary tale narrated in Darren's unique style is the finest part in the flick, where you behold evolution unfolding right before your eyes in quick fleeting successions whilst Russell goes in the background quoting the popular Biblical story of world's creation - ""Let there be light!""While Darren might have fumed many by toying around with the story, he has succeeded in creating an even more beautiful tale of evil, forgiveness, scorn, malice, hatred n love!",Noah
152,Danny_G13,"Feels longer than it is, but isn't terrible",7,29 December 2014,"I have given this a generous 7 out of 10 despite its rather glaring flaws, due to the fact that while it was far from perfect it was nevertheless pretty entertaining, even if it felt like a 4 hour movie.Noah sees Russell Crowe's Noah tasked with the mission of saving the innocents, or 'animals' and ending the failed reign of man on Planet Earth.God, or 'The Creator' as he's referred to in this movie, spoke to Noah, preaching of an impending flood and that the only ones to be saved were himself, his family and the 'innocents'. Naturally this saving process was to be done via the construction of a surprisingly large and sturdy ark, and therefore only the most sheltered viewer wouldn't be aware this is a story from the Bible.The biggest problem, and there are many, in this film is the process of characterisation, story-building, and 'preparation' for the great expedition in said ark takes an absolute age - while it certainly breeds good insight into why this is happening, it nevertheless feels painfully drawn out and I truly believed by the time we were seabound around 2+ hours had elapsed when barely one had.There are also downsides in casting. Anthony Hopkins' brief cameo as an aged Methuselah just didn't work on any level, and neither did his Welsh accent. The man is a Hollywood legend but he felt placed here for star attraction rather than what he could bring to the role.Ray Winstone's Tubal-cain is truly terrible - and I don't mean this as a slight on Winstone - but a heavy cockney accent equally destroyed the believability of a biblical character. His acting was acceptable, but he wasn't plausible. He also has the issue of being in so many commercials here in the UK that you half expected him to say 'it's got our name on it' or 'the most popular online sports betting company'.Despite criticism, I personally felt Crowe's Noah was good. Crowe has a charm to him, an ability to make a charismatic character with presence, and to dull down his strong Aussie accent to make himself more credible. It worked here, like it did in Yuma. He's a very underrated actor.The supporting cast was reasonable; Connelly did a solid job as Naameh and Emma Watson, struggling to break the Harry Potter shackles, wasn't bad either as Ila.But the problem came down to the disjointed preparation along with the feeling that something just didn't quite overall click here. The CGI rock monsters (the 'Watchers') were actually funny, and I have no idea whose idea they were, because they looked ludicrous. Imagine LOTR's Treebeard in smaller rock form and you have some idea - they did not go with the movie here at all.And the super-fast 'ground travel' sequences did not blend with the rest of the story either; it was plain what was being attempted but it felt forced and out of place.Last but not least is the irritation that a movie about Noah and his ark spent so little time on the ark itself. It felt far too brief, after all the build up, the marquee prize of the story, that aforementioned ark, really didn't get the opportunity to shine.One thing I do praise is the lack of overly religious connotations. The refusal to use the word 'God' and the general lack of theological twaddle was to be commended, because I didn't feel like being preached to for over two hours. Yes, there were some lines, like punishing man, the Garden of Eden, and other related topics but they weren't overly saturated through this.But the CGI overall was surprisingly bad - fake animals looked fake, and some of the layers were painfully obvious.But that said it was far from the worst film I've seen, and I enjoyed it enough not to feel horrified by the end, just a little let down by the especially large flaws.",Noah
153,shawneofthedead,"Ultimately, this Ark sinks beneath its own weight, but at least it goes down boldly.",4,3 April 2014,"Even if you're not remotely religious, this is a story you've heard before. Noah - a key figure in the Bible's Old Testament - was entrusted by God to re-start the world in the wake of a cleansing, catastrophic flood that would ultimately kill every other living creature. Noah and his family, together with a pair of every animal in existence, would wait out the deluge on a massive Ark. As contained within a few chapters of Genesis in the Bible, it's a fairly straightforward tale about new hope and life rising from the ashes of destruction. What Darren Aronofsky has done - both admirably and unfortunately - is depart from the bare facts of Noah's life to dig deep into the psyche of someone asked to forsake a world teeming with life and humanity.This world in which Noah (Russell Crowe) lives, we are told, has been badly corrupted by the descendants of Abel, the son of Adam and Eve who, many generations ago, slew his brother Cain. The righteous Noah - spared Abel's blood-curse for being descended from Abel's brother Seth - begins to realise through a series of prophetic dreams that the Creator has placed a great responsibility upon him. To purge the world of human evils, a flood will sweep across all the lands, and only those aboard Noah's Ark will survive. For years, Noah and his family labour to build the Ark, while struggling with their own personal burdens of guilt and doubt.It's in this addition of several layers of psychological depth that the film both triumphs and fails. In the Biblical story, Noah has no doubts about the rectitude and importance of his task, and appears to have no trouble at all carrying out a mission that will obliterate humanity from the face of the earth. In Aronofsky's dark, churning film, Noah is beset by questions and choices, each of which plague him to the brink of despair. Confronted with the loss of an entire civilisation, Noah must bear a whopping burden of survivor's guilt, and he winds up questioning if he and his family are really meant to re-boot humanity or to categorically end it, once and for all. This is deep, profound stuff, mixed up with weighty ideas of free will and pre-destination - it's very Old Testament, but also dares to hint at the kinder, gentler ethos of the New Testament in its final reel.But the execution of it is almost laughably bad. Noah's dilemma is baldly and oddly sketched out within his own family, the terrible decisions he must make sledgehammered home rather than treated with a little more grace and subtlety. For every truly haunting moment in the film (Noah sitting shell-shocked against the wall of his Ark as the begging, weeping cries of the dying fill the air), there are two or three that feel ripe and silly. In particular, Noah's second son Ham (Logan Lerman) and his desperation to secure a wife for himself plays at a constant soap-operatic pitch. Aronofsky's re-jigging of the tale also lays itself open to even more controversial implications than does the original story, which saw Noah, his sons and their wives board the Ark with little melodrama.Aronofsky doesn't help matters by pumping up his vision of the film with moments both surreal and wacky. This is a hyper-lit universe, Noah's dreams soaked in neon and awash in gloom. Noah forges an alliance with the Watchers, and again, Aronofsky's great ideas are foiled by their execution. These are fallen angels, beings of light and majesty encased in the primordial grime of our rocks and soil - they are trapped, literally, in our earth. But they also look like rock monsters ripped out of a low-budget, kitschy version of The Lord Of The Rings. Throw in Noah's anachronistic tendency to wear clothes that look a lot like jeans, and it's frequently hard to really buy into the extreme gravity of the entire film.The cast manages to enliven proceedings somewhat. Crowe is suitably tortured and miserable as Noah, morphing from anointed one to tortured anti-hero and, finally, a raving religious zealot bent double under the weight of his Creator's task. Jennifer Connelly delivers a surprisingly nuanced performance as Noah's wife Naameh, considering that the character is really little more than a human-sized obstacle placed squarely in his path. In her tears and anguish, Connelly hints at the love in Noah that helps make the film's final scenes more emotionally powerful (when they aren't oddly creepy and disturbing). Emma Watson does some good work as Ila, the orphaned child brought into Noah's family who experiences a miracle of her own, although she's not given much support by Douglas Booth, who's hopelessly stodgy as Noah's eldest son Shem.For all its flaws and odd creative choices (including scenery-chewing turns by Ray Winstone as villainous stowaway Tubal-Cain and Anthony Hopkins as Noah's mad old grandpa Methuselah), Noah is a compelling watch. In re-inventing an age-old story, Aronofsky chose to confront rather than avoid the very real psychology of an impossible mission. It teems with interesting ideas and insights, even if these are often lost beneath the stranger aspects of the film's loose, weird script. The film itself may be, ultimately, a failure, but at least it fails bravely, with plenty of ambition to spare.",Noah
154,jawneyfloros,the story of Noah's arc,2,20 November 2018,Review: I found this to be an interesting concept due to taking the classic bible story of Noah's ark and bringing it to life. The direction is good and so is the screenplay. The casting and acting aren't bad. I find this to be a rather interesting choice of movie to adept from the bible because there are so many different choices of stories to be made from the bible some done better then others but no one that I can think of took on the classic story of Noah's ark so I owe a lot of credit to Darren Aronofsky for taking on this massive feet. All in all I would give this 2 stars out of a possible five stars.,Noah
155,TheMarwood,Watchable until it collapses under the weight of its own self seriousness,4,9 July 2014,"Of all the strengths the talented director Darren Arnofsky has, subtly is not one of them and this biblical epic only exemplifies that and drowns this movie in a sea of self importance. It's not the bloated vanity project I expected it to be, where filming big budget bible epics has usually brought out ego and ambition in equal parts, but Noah does collapse under its own hubris. It begins watchable enough and plays out like a genre fantasy film, so unless you bring your own religious baggage, it's easy enough to swallow this material. Crowe gives a committed performance and Connelly does some fine work as well, even with her distracting beauty makeup and perfect hair throughout the destruction of all mankind. Winstone does what he can with his one dimensional villainous role and of course, no modern day bible epic would be complete without Anthony Hopkins hamming it up. There's some surprisingly shoddy effects work, including a CG baby and some unconvincing virtual camera work that look more like a video game than cinematic. The water effects blended pretty well with what wasn't a CG set and Arnofsky actually shows some restraint not to over due it with animated destruction and mayhem. Hopkins' Methuselah character randomly has the power to make a sterile woman able to be with child, but doesn't have the power to get himself berries and never is it hinted that this old man possesses any powers - but it's this contrivance that sets up the remainder of the last act. These babies being able to repopulate go against Noah's mission and test his will to a breaking point, but it's an unconvincing plot point that feels forced and tacked on to amp up the drama and provide an ending. Even if that plot point was taken verbatim from its source material, it doesn't work on screen. Noah is never a boring film, but a hardly a success and it at least has the dignity not to pander to the least discerning church goer.",Noah
156,Figgy66-915-598470,"A dark epic, not at all biblical",8,7 April 2014,"7 April 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza, Dorchester Tonight - Noah. Now I love a good biblical epic, growing up there was nothing better on a rainy Sunday afternoon than tea and cake and good helping of Ben Hur, or Spartacus etc. Noah on the other hand is not from the same stable. Thoroughly given the Middle Earth treatment I thought we were delving into The Lord of The Rings. Grand scale doom and epic battles were portrayed in this film, which tells the story of the creation through to the beginning of the new world. Don't assume from what I say that I disliked the film....on the contrary I enjoyed it quite a lot (although I think, judging from the other comments I heard, I am in the minority). It was a very dark portrayal of Noah (Russell Crowe) and his family, battling against the evils of men, and the more disturbing portrayal of Noah battling his own demons as he struggled to understand what the Creator required him to do. A solid performance from Emma Watson, she certainly ain't Hermione Granger any more. Ray Winston played the baddie as only he can do.....with aplomb. A suitable grand musical score accompanied every scene and with the evolution of the species in the back of your mind, be prepared to see some very odd animals. Don't go and see this film if you are expecting the nice colourful story from your Children's Bible to jump out at you from the screen......it's way darker than that!!!!",Noah

You will be very mad that you bought this movie it was that bad of a movie. It was good at first but it got worst throughout the movie. It really was a bad movie that no one should see. It was like if someone forced you to watch this movie that is how bad this movie was. It was one of the worst movies of this year. You will be so happy when the movie is over that is how bad Noah was. You will say BOO BOO BOO that is how bad this movie is,Noah
159,ExpendableMan,The snakes are coming too?,8,7 April 2014,"Okay, let's get this out of the way right now; there are no six limbed, fallen Angel rock monsters in the Bible. And by including these proto- Transformers in the film, Director Darren Aronofsky has probably had to make a concession to get it made. But as far as pandering to the Blockbuster crowd goes, that's about it. Because bar a few spectacular set pieces, 'Noah' is not the kind of film that audiences would flock to if they're up for a wild night out at the multiplex. It's a sombre and frequently bleak examination of not only the wrath of God, but also the utter anguish that would accompany an event on the scale of a global flood. After all, you wouldn't see any of the characters in a Michael Bay movie struggling with survivor's guilt and madness.Set during the days of...ah hell, you know what the story is. God has grown tired of the world and decided to flood it so as to punish all the residents of Earth (except for the floaty ones and the swimmy ones who get out due to a loophole). It rains, there's a boat, the aftermath is a bit incestuous and creepy, so how do you make it an engaging film?Well, casting Russell Crowe as the title character was definitely a wise move. When the film starts he's a hardy and devoted family man reminiscent of Maximus Decimus Meridius with less armour. As the story progresses however, his determination leads to desperation and a religious mania that'd make Fred Phelps look like an open minded and easy going fellow. It's Crowe's best role in years and his impeccable performance is the key to the film's success.Aronofsky leaves his own mark etched indelibly on the film as well. Early in the proceedings, a spring breaks forth from a cracked and dried out wasteland and the camera follows the ensuing trickle in a rapid fire series of shots, spreading across the landscape as night turns to day and back again. The Watchers meanwhile are not your typical Big Movie concession and as they shamble groaning across the screen, you get the distinct impression that their rocky bodies make their very existence a perpetual torture. And one shot of the damned clinging to the last vestiges of land as the waters continue to rise is remarkably unforgiving.Elsewhere, Ray Winstone gives it his barbarian best as Noah's rat munching foe and both Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly hold their own as Noah's adopted daughter and wife respectively. Despite the relatively sparse main cast however, his three sons don't get much of a chance to develop beyond being stock characters. Douglas Booth, Logan Lerman and Leo McHugh Carroll all have flashes of promise, but the parts are underwritten and they don't really develop beyond their roles of ""Looks A Bit Like John Snow,"" ""Destined To Have An Argument Before The End"" and ""The Other One."" As a piece of spring time spectacle however, Noah is well worth a trip to the cinema and it's well worth handing over the extra cash for an IMAX screening. It's a big, bold movie but it has a depth and resonance to it as well. The scene where Crowe sits immobile, listening to the screams of people dying and stubbornly refuses to help even as you can tell he desperately wants to is excellent. It's a bit overlong and hardcore atheists will not care for it at all, but it's proof that Aronofsky can hang with the blockbuster crowd as well as the art house. That reptile deer thing at the beginning is a bit weird though.",Noah
160,jb_campo,Good acting and interesting screenplay,7,24 June 2015,"Put aside the religious bent and you have a pretty good story here with some decent acting. The Bible tells the story of Noah, who is told by God to build an ark and take a bunch of animals to save because God is going to flood the earth. No spoilers there.From that premise, this story does a nice job of telling you the background of Noah, his family, and his personal struggles to follow God's directions regardless of the impact on his family.In the end, if you look at it as Noah's struggle to do right and try to make sense out of his lot in life, it's a fascinating story. Russell Crowe is terrific as Noah. Jennifer Connelly is fine as his wife, and then there's my fave, Anthony Hopkins as grandpa. Ya gotta love him still. The CGI plays a big role, but the acting is really good, and the story entertaining, and tightly enough woven to not be too slow.I recommend viewing this if you like good acting, and are curious for a deeper theatrical take on this biblical event.",Noah
161,nicolechan916,"Good visuals and incredible photography, but the plots and the characters were shallow.",4,16 June 2014,"Everyone knows the basic story of Noah and his ark. He built an ark to shelter the animals from the flood. So this film being a remake should have done more with the story, or better yet, left it alone. The cast in this is pretty big and it was cool to see familiar faces, but it was not enough to save this film.Honestly, I'm not a religious person at all, and I guess from watching this I learned a bit of the background of how Noah came to build his ark, but it got pretty boring towards the end. Throughout the film it was just kind of flat. There were one or two suspenseful moments, but it just felt like the film cut from here to there too much.OK a bit of a spoiler. Fallen Angels came to Earth to help mankind, but turned into moving rock structures. What in the world. Hell no! What is this? A religious myth mixed with what transformers would have been like before cars? *Sigh. I feel like I wasted money on this. For sure. They had fighting scenes as well but it was a bit too gruesome. Lots of blood– also where deaths of the animals were concerned. (I'm definitely on my way to becoming a vegetarian)One thing that was good; the visuals of nature. There was this scene with a time-lapse/stop-motion of a river growing and that was really nicely done. Also, some other scenes had beautiful landscapes, which was cool, but that's about the only thing that was good about this film. The first half wasn't so bad I guess, but the second half was really going nowhere.Well I guess another thing that was good, was the acting. Not incredible, but from Emma Watson and Logan Lerman it was pretty good. I didn't see them as Hermione or Percy.

162,akash_sebastian,Weakest Aronofsky Film Till Date,6,16 December 2014,"I've been an Aronofsky fan through and through, but this might be his weakest film till date. First of all, with the interesting filmography he has, why he decided to take on a biblical story. Anyway, his take on the story was somewhat dark, but not dark enough or even intriguing. It's just a small simple story fleshed out without any proper depth or reason.I have to agree the acting is well done but everyone, but would be easily forgotten.The only noteworthy and memorable scene from the movie is this sequence in which the creation of earth is shown by blending both the Biblical creation theory as well as Darwin's evolution theory; it's really fascinating and spectacular.",Noah
163,trublu215,Aronofsky's attempt at an epic of Biblical proportions,5,31 March 2014,"Noah marks Darren Aronofsky's most prolific and ambitious film to date...it also stands as his most undercooked, underdeveloped, yet visually stunning film as well. Noah tells the story of Noah's ark and the events leading up to the Great Flood which is depicted in the book of Genesis. The problem that exists here is pure style over substance. While I am a devout Catholic I am also open to other interpretations of the stories in the Bible. It's all about understanding that this is a movie, this is somebody else's vision and it should not influence anyone's current beliefs of the story of Noah. The fact that this is a more glorified and violent telling of Noah does not bother me. What bothers me about this film is that it strayed very far from the story in the Bible, creating more back story for the sake of the film and for the sake of Russell Crowe's performance. Every scene between Crowe and Connelly feels forced as if there is no chemistry between these two leads. Then you have the brilliant Ray Winstone who is utterly phenomenal but fails to really up the ante between Crowe and him. It rather disappoints especially considering the widely known ending, everything building up to that point feels useless and unnecessary. The visuals in Noah are amazing, the color schemes Aronofsky uses, the sweeping camera pans, the over the shoulder following the character, it all screams Aronofsky's previous film entries but the difference with Noah is, quite honestly...its boring as all hell. No matter how pretty something looks, there needs to be a driving force behind that and Noah just didn't have it. Overall, this is a film with great technical aspects and visually stunning effects, that is bogged down by poor acting and even worse plot devices. Depending on what type of movie goer you are, you'll either love it or hate it. For me, I'm happily in between.",Noah
164,cinephile-27690,Not for those who want Genesis onscreen.,9,24 January 2019,"The Bible tells the story of Noah in Genesis 6-9, which is only 4 chapters long. The movie Noah is over 2 hours long, so that should immediately show that there will be inaccuracies.Think about Jonah: A Veggie Tales Movie-that is also adapted from a 4 chapter story and that has a bonus plot involving a seafood restaurant. The actual story has fish slappers, Go Fish playing, a cheese curls sweepstakes, etc.Of course, many people love Veggie Tales despite this. When it comes to live action movies that twist on the Bible, that's when things get controversial.Think back to 1988, when The Last Temptation of Christ, a movie Martin Scorsese made as a personal journey to consider what the human nature of Jesus was like, released.Since that strayed from the Gospels, and had scenes like Jesus making love to Mary Magdalene, there were protests, vandalized theaters, attacked moviegoers(if they wanted to see it), bans in multiple countries, and even death threats to Scorsese.How ironic it is that the movie portrays God's love better than the Christians against the movie, many of whom did not even bother to see it! I did, and it is a tie for my favorite movie!Now, what does this have to do with Noah? Noah has gained controversy as well, but not as harshly. This also strays from the Bible in many ways.Some examples of this are: Rock monsters helping to build the ark, Methuselah-the oldest man in the Bible, being related to Noah and not having a fruit in ages, as well as dying in the flood, Noah preaching doom and not repentance for his wicked neighbors, Noah's daughter in law giving birth on the ark,etc.These changes are weird and take a few minutes to adjust to(hence my 9/10) but after a while I just put the fact that this is supposed to be a Bible story in the back of my mind and enjoyed it as what it is-a movie. That is a huge improvement from my 6/10 I gave it the first time I watched this movie.To get to my point, if you want Genesis onscreen, then skip this movie. If you are curious and open to a re-interpretation of this story, then this movie is worth your time. If you are in the first category, then do not read any more reviews and move on to another movie to learn about.",Noah
165,doorsscorpywag,this actually IS the worst movie ever made.,1,9 July 2014,"If Carlsberg is a measure of excellence then this movie must have been made by Tuborg a beer even tramps would not drink.Many reviews across IMDb state that this or that movie is 'the worst movie ever made' and usually that is a bit unfair but this pitiful drivel may actually be exactly that. First of all lets establish I am an Atheist and believe none of the nonsense of the source novel but that does not mean I can't enjoy a good religious epic. TGSET was excellent as was that one with Charlie Heston as Moses. Ben Hur again with Chas was a superb film as was The Robe so religion and film is not a big deal to me but this insult to even the intelligence of an amoeba crossed a line of awfulness I never thought I would witness.We start of in the usual Mad Max like Dystopian past with people scrabbling around for food and two distinct factions.First we have the Cockneys who tear animals apart live and wear rudimentary welding masks and are led by Beowulf and secondly the Hippies who eat berries and seem to be animal loving vegetarians even though they wear animal skins. Perhaps they have invented some kind of synthetic material it never explains that irony.Anyway the Hippy leader, we will call him Noah, after a very ambiguous dream decides that the Creator is going to kill the world and he has been chosen to rescue the innocents. The silly part is that the 'innocents' are the animals which is a bit daft as they tear each other apart live everyday to live. Just like the Cockneys who are 'evil'.So Maximus decided that he needs to build an 'Ark' even though the word probably did not exist back then as these people did not seem to be familiar with sailing or they would be eating fish rather than dried grass. He is helped out by his Welsh granddad who gives him a handy seed from which grows a forest as well as help from some handy giant stone men who were once angels.Word gets round to the Cockneys who instead of just building their own from the same forest decide to swipe the Hippies. Meanwhile animals start appearing including the birds who are too lazy to fly and the Ark begins to fill. To get around the annoyance the animals would just eat each other Nobby invents a magic gas that makes the animals fall asleep but has no effect on his family. This is a bit of a cock up on the director who obviously has not read the source novel or he would know that 'the animals went in two by two' was just for stupid people too idle to read the book the film is based on. The animals did not go in two by two so if you are going to pass this tripe off as history at least read the chapter on Arks.Meanwhile the Cockneys turn up after inventing smelting and making iron age weapons and are a bit peeved that the stone giants are between them and the Ark. Cue tumultuous battle whilst water spouts appear and within minutes the place is awash.So the wicked are smited and the Love Boat takes off. Only there is a problem. The Captain has gone mental and decided that only the animals should live and the humans must die. Unfortunately Hermione from Harry Potter who they adopted along the way has gotten knocked up by one of the Captains randy sons and that is not in the Creators plans. So Nobby decided everyone must be knifed horribly to death as that is the only way the Creator will be happy. Even after a hard day drowning the Cockneys there is always room for a bit of stabbing babies to death with these Creator types.But of course Nobby does not do it or how would we be here if it was not for the incestuous goings on of the Noahs.I have said nothing about the acting mainly due to the fact it was bleeding awful. Half drunk Chimps could have done a better job.Even God would disown this garbage but I gave it 1 because at least the director was brave enough to tackle the fate of the dinosaurs. Ray Winstone ate them all whilst hiding out on the Ark at the end.Every copy of this film should be piled in a heap and burnt as it is insulting on so many levels least of which is the religious one. Terrible :(",Noah
166,martinrobertson300482,Will leave most people bewildered,2,16 April 2014,"""Noah's Ark"" is one of those age old stories that I'm surprised hasn't really been made into a movie before now. But when you see the final result of this dreary mess, maybe there's an actual serious reason that it hadn't been tackled before.Most people (myself included) are only going to watch this flick for the infamous ""flood scene."" But the movie tries so hard to be ""something different"" it wouldn't off came as a surprise if that scene didn't even come. I really can't see this movie pleasing anyone who bothers to watch it. Neither the relgious folk, who it may offend, or the cinema going masses, who are simply looking for a couple of hours of explosive entertainment, are going to get much out of it. The original Noahs ark is such a short story, that it would have to be almost entirely changed for a movie. And it has been. In a bad way! The ""2 of every animal"" stuff fills about 2 minutes of the flick, while the rest is like some tacky soap opera, crossed with a poor mans ""Lord of the rings."" Russell Crowe plays Noah, so that he can tick off another larger than life role from his check-book. But he does little but sport a varying collection of beards. While some of the other (though decent) actors, are stuck playing over-done characters. Noah himself isn't the ""nice-guy"" he's suppose to be here. But nothings what its suppose to be is it? I mean, why are all the animals I wanted to see knocked out/not there for 95 percent of the movie? Why are there all these plot twists that no-one is interested in? What the hell are those rock monster things suppose to be? Why is the (seriously over expensive) Ark shaped like a giant match box? And Why do I feel like I'm drunk watching this thing?What would of maybe worked better as a family movie with some sort of important lesson (Please don't sin kids/Be bad kids) has instead been turned into a dark fairy tale that attempts to please everyone. But will in actual fact, please no-one. The Stories a shambles, Crowes ""bad-ass"" Noah is dislikeable, and the films overall poor special effects and over the top ""everything"" will leave most people bewildered when its all done.",Noah
167,ghost_dog86,What a jerk!,4,30 March 2014,"Think ""Take Shelter"", ""Mad Max"", add in a touch of ""The NeverEnding Story"" and then set it in the Shire and you get the basis for the world writer/director Darren Aronofsky builds in his new film, ""Noah"". While that may sound pretty awesome and while this biblical epic was probably better than that Jesus movie which just came out a few weeks back, aside from some million dollar flood visuals, this story of the ""original apocalypse"" comes off as rather dry.The plot isn't anything you aren't familiar with. When 600 year old (going on 50) Noah sees visions of the end of the world, he informs his family that they must drop everything and build a super-ark that will fit two of every animal, so they may survive the great flood to come. Naturally his family agrees to do so, and with the help of some fallen angels who sort of resemble Rockbiters from ""The NeverEnding Story"", they build said ark.With a cast the likes of Russell Crowe as the constant pessimist, Noah, Jennifer Connelly as his wife, Anthony Hopkins as Methuselah and Emma Watson as Ila (a girl the family adopts) one would expect to be drowned in great performances. But sadly nobody but Crowe and Ray Winstone, who plays evil Tubal-cain, are given anything to do. Yes, Hopkins gets a few laughs as a comic relief interpretation of Methuselah, but all Connelly does is emote the same dour expression for the entire film and Watson isn't given more than one line to say until the movie is almost over (even then, she mostly just sobs). From moment one, it's all about the visuals. I get it. But, then why cast what looks to have been a shockingly pricey group of actors if you're just going to restrict them to playing made for TV written characters? More things that are wrong with ""Noah"": Right off the bat, when the Rockbiter-angel-things start talking (and they are in this movie for a good hour or so) it is painfully hard not to immediately dismiss ""Noah"" as ridiculous. And it doesn't help that when these cringe inducing creature aren't on screen, the dialogue between the humans is hokey as hell (the script was written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel).Aronofsky does know his way around cinematic visuals and unleashes his full bag of tricks for this big budget epic. As I alluded to before, the flood sequences are spectacular. And there is a flash montage sequence near the end that sees a two minute visual rundown of the creation of the universe, earth and life itself, which is unbelievably inspired and reminds us all that Aronofsky is still one of the most technically limit-pushing directors working today. That said, ""Noah"" contains numerous visuals that range from confusing, unintentionally ridiculous, or should be labeled as just plain poor CGI (especially when it comes to the shockingly bad computer generated animals; which there are many).Maybe Peter Jackson should have directed this: It's funny because in 2014 it's hard to visually differentiate a fantastical story like this one from one set outside of Middle-earth. Therefore, one can't totally blame Aronofsky for attempting to detour from the usually dry bible films in order to create something visually eye catching. But the story of Noah and many biblical tales from the Old Testament lend themselves to such fantastical imagery, that in the wrong hands, visuals come off as unbelievably absurd and off-putting.But the biggest problem I had with ""Noah"" was simplyI didn't care. Here's the thing: If somebody is telling/showing me a story, even one that I am quite familiar with and enjoy hearing, their interpretation must still contain some emotional investment or character(s) that audiences can have stake in or care about. Simply stated, with ""Noah"", this aspect was overwhelmingly lacking. Maybe it was the front-loaded silly visuals, or the bland conversations or the unlikable characters, but not for one second did Aronofsky get me to emotionally invest in the plights of anyone on-screen. Oh, wait. That's not entirely true. In all actuality, the one character which I did find myself taking interest in was Tubal-cain, simply because he was the only beacon of lively thespian entertainment I could find.Final Thought: While watching ""Noah"" I will say that there were a couple of moments where I was physically on the edge of my seat. There were two. During the introduction of the Tubal-cain character (watching Winstone absolutely devour the scenery as ""the bad guy"") and during the final half an hour when Noah gets all baby-killy. But that was it. ""Noah"" is two hours and eighteen minutes long and I was entertained by all of 40 minutes of it. Now if I say that ""Noah"" stands as my least favorite Darren Aronofsky film to date, that may be a bit misleading since the worst of Aronofsky is still pretty damn good. So, I'll keep it simple. Religious debates regarding accuracy and such aside, overall ""Noah"" was a bore.",Noah
168,galahad58-1,No-Watch,2,3 August 2014,"This garbage falls into my category of ""worse films ever made"". What is so bad about it? Everything: the acting is below par, the script is terrible and ridiculous at the same time, the directing is juvenile, and the cinematography is dreadful. Why did this film have to be shot in dreary colors? Why did it have to look post-apocalyptic? First off, unless you are very religious: the story of Noah is logistically impossible: Noah and his family build an ark -- let us think that through, to build an ark to house two of every animal in the world that ark would have been as big as a city and there would be no way that one man and his small family could have built that in their lifetime--God wants to destroy all of mankind--are you saying every single man (except Noah) is evil? We know that is impossible. God wants to destroy every single plant and animal. Why? Why would God punish and kill every animal when (as we have seen in the Ten Commandments) he has the power to kill man alone without harming anything else? Because the ark is logistically impossible, the screenwriters give Noah celestial beings to help build the ark. I bet they are glad that Peter Jackson gave them an idea to steal. But still--why would God give them the celestial beings and sprout trees for them to KILL when he could have just given them the ark? Twenty minutes before ripping down the trees, Noah is preaching how you do not destroy life to his son and now he destroys an entire woodlands.Avoid this movie at all costs.

Noah's sons and their wives were the only people who believed him and went on the ark. Everyone else was destroyed by flood. Well, this movie does NOT portray the Noah story like that! Noah is portrayed as one of the meanest people in the bible! He lets an innocent woman die in the flood. He talks ugly to his son and wife. He wanted to kill two innocent newborn baby girls right after they were born! Also, Methuselum had no role in the bible, other than being the oldest man who ever lived.

Nearly blockbuster.'Noah' the ""nearly"" film offers plenty but clinches very little.I found the actors mainly sub-par and insufficiently directed resulting in oddly uncoordinated performances that didn't marry together: neither between characters nor over the course of any single characters development.The mixed up styles and tone sometimes produced a storytelling idea or a visual design that was worth all the trouble but usually a nagging blockbuster-ness or a character flatness, or both, intervened to drive out the better quality element of 'Noah'.The special effects are mainly, but not always, disappointing and the costumes and props similarly so. The sound design is altogether un-enhancing to the onscreen profferings.I rate a 5/10 and I think that fans of the director will enjoy checking this out more than fans of any principle cast member or a general film watcher will and I recommend accordingly; simply put, a lot of effort has clearly been put into making 'Noah' and all that effort has produced a film that I am happy to have seen but I'm not convinced that the overall effect is that valuable.",Noah

How naive of me to think this Christian minority accurately depicted the effect of the film. I have never seen a treatment of this biblical occurrence and thought it should have its day. Am thrilled to share how much I enjoyed this portrayal.The many short stories on TV that address the uncovering of the actual ship on Mt. Ararat intrigued me and desired to learn more. It turns out this depiction is way off base and the many elements of the story are not even hinted at in the Genesis. I was fascinated at the family interaction, survivor guilt, the family tree, and most of all the connection with the Creator. Can folks in Biblical times live to 1000 years? I sure hope so because I plan to do this as well. Who knows what really happened but something sure did and I am completely satisfied with this treatment.I had to warm up to the ""Watchers"" knowing how difficult it would be to portray such entities. And although there are many unanswered questions I applauded the invitation to dialogue. The Super Rabbi who provided a most comprehensive review seemed on the defensive end but allowed a glimpse into the perspective of the Jewish midrash. I know this is creative license with appropriate references but remains a guess.

172,treywillwest,A revision of the Noah legend.,5,3 August 2014,"Interesting and daring work that revisions the Old Testament. As you would imagine, it looks great, but the film is far from fully satisfying, but by no means a waste of celluloid either. Genesis is turned into an action movie, but the mythical Hero is re imagined as regular human. Noah follows the Path, but in doing so, becomes an obsessive fundamentalist unconcerned with the well-fare of anyone around him. True to cine-nerdom, Aronofsky re-imagines Noah as the Western anti-hero. Like John Wayne in Searchers and Red River, Noah masters the inhuman, and then banishes himself from humanity.As is typical of Hollywood nowadays, they negate the complexity of the narrative with a generic,and half-felt, happy-ending.",Noah

This is a film of messages in the form of pictures. When watching, try to forget logic, and just look at it as a form of art. If you go into it with that mind-frame, the you'll appreciate it more.Noah is a very powerful film, that will make you take a closer look at yourself after the end credits roll. It's not really the action film it's being made out to be. It's a very thought provoking, beautifully shot film with some memorable sequences--despite several flaws. I found that there were a few predictable moments and the end lacked a climatic punch--on both plot and character driven levels.I can't give this film a review without mentioning Aronofsky and his wonderful vision. For those who don't like the film due to its unfaithfulness to the source material, then, think again. This is a film that people of all different faiths would enjoy. Aronofsky leaves everything open to interpretation, including the idea of God, who/which is never shown in this film or never even mentioned.To top all of this off, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connolly absolutely put everything into these roles--which add urgency to what is otherwise a very mellow-dramatic plot, but powerful nevertheless--for all of it's metaphorical and spiritual conveyances.7/10",Noah

To say sex up I actually mean make it up as they go along in a pretty weird way, The Watchers, did they stumble by accident from a transformer movie? The closest they get to the bible was that the god of the old testament was a vindictive old sod and what was with the politically correct 'creator' instead of god.So when my wife asked ""did it mention..."" no just watch it. This is simply a made up science fiction movie. With a movie the question is were you entertained? actually yes, it moved with decent pace and Ray Winstone was thrown in doing a East End biblical gangster, which was enjoyable.

177,jp281995,Real bad,4,18 August 2019,"I watched this movie because the trailer looked great, at least for me anyway. It's a retelling of Noah, who made the ark before the Great Flood.I didn't actually mind if they made a bit of changes from the Biblical account, but they did a lot. And the worst part are the talking stone giants. When I saw them, I knew the movie is going downhill.This movie has like $150 million budget, I've read, but most of the visual effects looked cheap and poorly done. Cinematography also isn't that good. I was shocked to see that it's a hundred million dollar film.Emma Watson, I feel, is miscast. Connelly is an okay choice, but someone could've played Noah's wife better. Their two sons, Percy Jackson and the hot British actor, were not great choices for the roles. Only Russell Crowe seems to be the only right actor fit for the role.",Noah
178,JaydoDre,Not bad but disappointing,6,20 August 2014,"The first and main issue is perhaps not with the movie itself, but it nonetheless inevitably reflects upon the film due to the subject material it chose to deal with. This issue is the attitude of Noah and his family: ""better than though"". Noah and his wife speak several times about them being the chosen ones. They are special and others are not. Others, the ones living in the cities are wicked and are going to be destroyed but they, the ones living in the dirt are the chosen ones. Kudos to the film for underlining this, but it does present a bit of a problem.The problem is that it seems that the movie (and the source material this story comes from) wants you to root for Noah and his family. This is evident because the bad king of men is shown to be a murderer, and also at one point he says that he'll take what he wants, showing that he is arrogant and selfish. But beyond that, his motivations throughout the rest of the film are completely justifiable and he is generally just trying to save his people. Meanwhile, his subjects are shown as debauched through the way they treat their weak ones, but this only underlines the fact that there are weaker and more innocent people in their midst, whom God apparently deems to be collateral damage in his great plan.In short, I did not know whom to root for because the protagonists were somewhat unlikable.The realistic portrayal of God's message was nice. His message came to Noah through dreams that Noah then interpreted himself. However the movie then undermines this realistic portrayal by having magical stone angels, fire swords and the eventual super-flood instead of a more realistic heavy storm it could have gone with. Noah's portrayal as a religious fanatic is also interesting, but as already mentioned, this just contributes to him being kind of unlikable.Noah is not Gladiator's best performance. He is a little bland, always either stoic or angry, with half his face obscured by the beard towards the 2nd half of the movie. But the movie does have Anthony Hopkins and Ray Winstone in it, both of whom were great when they came on screen. Especially Ray as the villain was memorable.Perhaps the biggest sin this movie commits though is that it is not very impressive or memorable. Here you have a world-wide flood, a disaster of biblical proportions (and for once that is not just a saying). So where is the anger, the struggle, the scale, the raining for 40 days and 40 nights? This should have been the father of all disaster movies. Instead it's just this passive-aggressive family and a group of some angry locals...and some CGI giants.Whatever your opinion is of Christianity, the one thing you cannot call it is unimpactful or unimpressive. But this movie you can. Even the media have been rather quiet about it. Considering how the subject matter is handled, you'd expect Christian protests in the streets, but I have not heard much buzz about it.It's not a bad film though. I didn't find anything wrong with the cinematography. The story doesn't have anything crazy or illogical in it; it's just the story you already know being given a bit of spice to make it long enough to fill a movie. The villain is interesting; the special effects are OK; the sound design is OK; everything's kind of OK.Noah is not a bad film, but whether you will still remember it a month after seeing it is another question. It ends up on the pile of all the other average flicks like Need for Speed or Hercules. The disappointment is more with Noah not being the movie it could and should have been rather than with the movie it is.It is a weird mishmash of realism and Lord of The Rings level fantasy. I feel I would have respected it more if it went either all the way in one or in the other direction.",Noah

Visually, the film is good and some of the acting - notably Jennifer Connolly and Emma Watson, plus a nod to the equally reliable Anthony Hopkins - is excellent. But the whole thing hangs on Noah, who in this case comes across as the sort of fanatical Bible beater we are familiar with (and should be repulsed by) in far too many churches (and not just pseudo-Christian ones) across the world.
Given the nature of the Biblical story, this may have been an impossible task for Russell Crowe (who has shown sensitivity in other roles). And given the impossibility of reconciling the OT God with the Christian one Jesus talked about, perhaps it is time to remove the OT from the Christian Bible and treat it simply as a fascinating origin of man myth and history of the ME peoples, instead of a sacred book. After all, the OT can be - and all too often is - used to justify virtually anything, from incest through slavery to ethnic cleansing!",Noah

But that is not the reason I watched the film - it was because the film was directed by Darren Aronofsky and very well casted. Aronofsky is kind of director that even if his films are shallow they are at least visually striking (The Fountain). I can't say 'Noah' was particularly deep nor shallow as it dealt with classical themes on humans inner fights, hypocrisy and what is wrong what is right. Also I can't say it was visually striking as much - all the epicness were CGI (not that would be bad itself) and it seemed cheap and rushed at places. The epic battle scene in the middle of the film felt wrongly paced and ended as abruptly as it started, and it took 'Noah' little out of balance as after that the film started to fell like it's dragging it's feet.Russell Crowe in his brutal manliness proved again he is meant to carry these sort of epic history/fantasy films.",Noah
182,loco_73,Darren Aronofsky will bring about another Flood!,5,22 April 2014,"I walked into the movie theatre expecting something special from ""Noah"", given how high the bar had been set by Darren Aronofsky's last two pictures, ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swann"".Undertaking a movie project that deals with stories which are part and parcel of any one of the major religions is a dicey proposal at best and a thankless job to boot. No matter what you do you will offend someone and disappoint someone else. While movies like ""Ben Hur"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" have now become classics...there are not too many in that company.Yet underneath all the controversy, frenzy and hoopla, this is after all a story (whether you believe it's real or not is not the point of this review), a short one of course, but still populated with characters, a narrative, a plot etc. So by all rights, the rules that apply to any good movie-making effort, should have applied to ""Noah"" as well. Good cast, good script, good editing, score, special effects etc.Well, as far as I could see, none of those elements really came together for this movie. This was one convoluted film, with a story that was all over the place, unconvincing cast, shoddy script, bad editing and more shocking, given the movie's budget and today's technology, laughingly bad special effects.Russel Crowe was the only one that was right for this movie, the rest of the cast and the director...were not...by a longshot! I swear, at some point while watching this movie, I was wondering if I had inadvertently gone to the wrong movie theatre and stumbled on some SyFy movie-of-the-week version of ""The Lord Of The Rings""...""Noah"" is what ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy would have looked like if Peter Jackson had been dropped on his head and then turned into a crack addict ! By the end of the movie both my mind and body were numb, and I felt as if I had a bad acid trip...or someone had roofied my drink...Point being that, as much as it pains me to say it, because I like Darren Aronofsky, ""Noah"" was a misstep in his career. As a movie, ""Noah"" is a cinematic clunker and stinker!",Noah
183,BrickNash,Brilliant and dark adaptation. If this offends your faith you need a word with yourself!,8,8 July 2014,"First off let me say I am agnostic. I sway firmly on the side of science, logic and technology because that is simply what has been proved to be real to me but as a species who have barely left the surface of the planet no-one, and I mean no-one can know absolutely there is no divine force out there so to me, absolutes are just not logical.I was stunned at reading just how much hate this film has got from religious types and even more stunned at the ignorance from each faith towards each other. Yes, even I who has had no religious inklings past Sunday school when I was a boy know that Noah is featured in The Christian, Jewish and Islamic faiths but seemingly people from these walks don't even bother to find that out.The film itself I found to be glorious. It is an adaptation yes but what do you expect? It's a Hollywood film after all, not a religious documentary and if you are a person of faith who expected a pin point accurate depiction of he tale of Noah and spat the dummy when you saw this then you are a prick plain and simple.It took a while for me to get in to the film I'll admit but once there I was pretty captivated. A tremendous cast plays out a very unpredictable story. This is the beauty of an adaptation, even though we all know what happens in the Noah story there were times where I was honestly on the edge of my seat because I didn't quite know what was going to happen next and surely that is far better than just re-treading old ground. The film looks amazing with lush landscapes that look otherworldly and that added a great deal to the atmosphere because it didn't feel like it was set on Earth and I liked it. My only issue is with the CGI which, for 2014 is very sub par, particularly in how the Watchers move but it doesn't take away from the story.Let's be frank, the tale of Noah is a fine children's story but it is a tired old yarn that if done super accurately would maybe fill 40 minutes of screen time if that and there would be no twists and turns anywhere and would probably consist of half of that with everyone saying how great God is.This adaptation was dark and gritty but also very surreal as well. Everyone had a different accent in the film,but the fact that this could have EASILY been a sci-fi fantasy film set in another dimension is a very welcome feature. The very fact that God is always refereed to as 'The Creator' really gave me much more of a chill and sense of a super powerful being than any argument that I've heard in favour of faiths.a fun thing it reminded me of was the PC game Black & White here you play a god to a whole worlds that was nice.I knew I was in for something different when I heard that Darren Aronofsky was at the helm and I wasn't disappointed.Seriously, if you are religious then that is fine, really! God/Allah/Jehovah be with you and all that but this taking offence at the slightest thing to do with faith is really why the world has such a dim view of religion these days. The film did not portray Noah as an evil man but just a man and if you are that upset over a few changes to a story that is in a film designed for entertainment then you really need to prioritise your life better.Top marks for a film that is entertaining, disturbing captivating and unnerving.Highly recommended!",Noah
184,lucasnochez,Review: Noah/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,4,28 March 2014,"Controversy is sure to ensue following the release of the Bible's greatest and most epic story found in the Old Testament involving Noah and his arc. Visionary director and passionate auteur Darren Aronofsky has always been fascinated with the character of Noah, and the inner workings of a man tormented by the voice of God and conflicted by his own voice of reason. For the sake of skeptics, religious groups, and devout Catholics, I intend to avert my review very far away from any religious claims or criticism for the film Noah, and instead intend to only offer criticism on the film itself, regardless of its strong Biblical undercurrent. Visually, Noah floats adrift many previous films that share a similar look (The Road, Tree of Life, The New World) but unfortunately sinks in a preposterous commentary set amongst mythological creatures, accepting fate and the age-old argument of man versus God, man versus nature, and man versus himself.Aronofsky's Noah begins with the Bible's first chapter of creation and the story of Adam and Eve. As temptation lures Eve to evil, along with Adam, spawn Cain, Abel, and Seth proceed their parents to a new life. Cain kills Abel, and what begins is the regression of man's propensity for evil, death, and murder. Noah (Russell Crowe) is one of the last of Seth's bloodline, and he along with his family, including his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and his three sons, seem to be the only last remaining decent people during a time where descendants of Cain believe that natural survival instincts like killing and hunting are crucial to man's survival in the world.Aronofsky is a man fascinated with the inner workings of famously tormented individuals, and this project has been one of his greatest passion projects since beginning a career in film. Born to conservative Jewish parents, Aronofsky attempts not take any biased religious approach to his newest film, and instead focuses on the human element through an artistic lens. Insert 'The Watchers', mythological creatures/fallen angels who are imprisoned on Earth and betrayed by man, Noah, only momentarily floats as a forced visual studio epic that it never needed to be.With The Wrestler, Black Swan and yes, even The Fountain, Aronofsky challenged the aesthetic of his narratives with the power of his lead performers. Mickey Rourke, Natalie Portman and Hugh Jackman are all prisoners to the shattered worlds they live in and must confront their demons and life itself to overcome adversity. With Noah, one of many vexed characters in the Bible, Aronofsky never challenges his fate by elevating the choices of a man to the fate predestined by a Creator. Instead, and unlike any of the other characters in Aronofsky's films, Noah gives into accepting his fate of death, an unlikely characteristic for the director's leads and the man depicted early in the film. Crowe, who is unable to tap into the mind of a man and be led into acting sanctity like Aronofsky's previous actors, shows why he was the director's third choice to play the character behind Christian Bale and Michael Fassbender. Crowe's depiction of Noah is hardened much like 'The Watcher's' outer rock form. Not to mention he delivers a sloppy performance of a man who is the only person who can hear the Creator's voices in his head– often being eluded as a crazy person and not as the chosen one to hear The Creator's celestial voice.Like any other good Aronofsky character, Noah suffers from premonitions. He envisions the destruction of the world. With the help of his wise and all-knowing grandfather Methuselah (Sir Anthony Hopkins), Noah heeds to the Creators visions and builds an arc. Focused less on the creation of the arc itself, offering no type of montage to an arc that seemed to have lasted a least a decade to construct, Aronofsky directs his focus to man, the greatest evil the Creator has formulated–yet, it is a human being that puts together The Creator's plan. Throughout, by adding a very strong artistic take to a story that is resonant in the minds of religious individuals, once the inclusion of imagination and artistry is injected into anything Biblical, doubt crashes the mind like waves on a reef. Much like oil and water, two fluids that don't mix, art and religion are two very subjective and delicate areas to combine together. Just ask Mel Gibson, whose reimagining of the crucifixion of Christ, The Passion of Christ, will surely be met with a much larger commercial welcome than Noah.After the uproar of its first trailer, Paramount Pictures conducted various private secret screenings of different versions of the film, including Aronofsky's cut of the film, although he was signed to have the final cut of the movie out for distribution. Repulsed and deeply offended, Aronofsky got wind of the studios deception, and allowed the studio to reconsider and agree to release the film as the director had intended, with his cut intact. Since then, the newest trailer of the film is followed by a 'disclaimer' that the film is merely ""inspired by the story of Noah and that the film is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people"". I wonder what those millions will think of this 'artistic licence'. There is no doubting that, by the time the film was ready to be met by a large audience, Aronofsky's nerves have gotten the better of him, and it shows, since Noah seems to be the director's most personal work, but also his least confident.Want to read more on Noah?

185,Spartan_1_1_7,An epic movie of biblical proportions.,8,20 July 2014,"An epic movie of biblical proportions. Darren Aronofsky took Noah's story and added some of his own fictional/fantasy elements to deliver a great and immense visual experience.It is very apparent from the name that the story is based on Noah. But if you go in watching this movie religiously or something similar, you will surely be disappointed. The immense amount of hate this movie got was mostly from extreme religious people or atheists from what I have seen. Regardless, watching it with an open mind is the only way to go. I liked the first half more, mainly because of its more EPIC nature, whereas the second half was more tense and psychotic I should say. The movie had a stellar cast. Russel Crowe was great as Noah. Then you had other characters played by Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Watson, Logan lerman etc. I will say though that acting wasn't good all round, there were some inconsistencies here and there, even by the main cast but overall it was pretty good. The cinematography was great. The movie had countless amazing shots, beautifully rendered in CGI. Amazing overhead shots. A visual treat. Soundtrack was also really great, especially the epic pieces played during, of course, epic scenes. :pOverall, I really enjoyed this movie.

Does this mean that the money men will send him the way of Michael Cimino who quietly disappeared after Heaven's Gate? Surprising as he made two pictures I loved, The Wrestler and Black Swan. What went wrong? Well I'd advise no one over the age of thirteen waste precious movie time on this dud. I was brought up on the bible stories, not that I'm religious, but this pic really has little to do with the traditional story other than the main character is called Noah and he's building an ark, which actually looks like a long oblong box. I understand from what I've read that the Transformer like rock creatures here were meant to be some kind of angels but in all honesty by the time they arrived I couldn't care less about the rest of the film and didn't really have a clue as to what was going on. Anthony Hopkins turned up as he invariably does these days, and it reminded me of all those has been British MP's who turn up at the House of Lords each day to collect their £300. I rest my case. One star out of ten as I can't go any lower. Is Russell Crowe getting hard up for a buck? Oh! and Emma Watson is just a wooden here as she was in the Harry Potter pics.

Indeed, i would say the weakest link is Emma Watson who rarely changes expression from that by now familiar almost glazed over face she pulls in any part i've seen her in. You know the one, it's that mix of pained, perplexed, permanently constipated and deep in thought all rolled into one package. I honestly think she's a terrible actress who always seems to be trying way to hard, yet graduated from the Joey Tribiani school of acting.This is, though, a good film, i enjoyed it, though i felt the costume design was wrong for the age that these events are alleged to have taken place. I'm not a massive fan of trying to modernise the aesthetics of 'historic' films.",Noah
190,nickboldrini,Biblical action flick,6,1 January 2019,"Not sure how close this is to the Bible, but its a fun ride, playing with the conventional notions/imagery of the ark and so on, to give this more of the apocalyptic feel the flood would have been. If the story is accurate, its even more bonkers than the sanitised version we are taught at school is, which makes the narrative hard to like - Noah is not portrayed as a nice chap here. But it is well acted throughout, with only some scene chewing by Ray Winstone, mainly.",Noah
191,LiamBlackburn,A powerful epic re-telling of the story,8,9 April 2014,"Well-paced and great special fx. Noah is played really well. I like those rock creatures, they're cool. There are (thankfully) added dimensions to the story, as Noah believes Man must cease existing completely to let the innocent creatures be on Earth by themselves. To complicate matters, some of Noah's kids want to live and procreate and stay alive; which is against Noah's wishes.Then there's the stowaway guy who wanted to destroy all the rock creatures and take over the ark. He tried to manipulate the son of Noah into taking revenge because Noah let his girlfriend die. These are all fresh elements to the story that make it more entertaining. I'm sick of zealots trying to bring this move down because it's ""not a true recounting""....lulz, You know....there's a reason why people fall asleep in Church all the time....Imagine if the Bible was written in this more emotionally dynamic way. It would be more readable and relatible. The Bible basically TELLS you how to live and do things with no other options. This movie (on the other hand), expresses the human struggle that accompanies tribally-motivated dogmata. It highlights the human condition and its inherent paradoxes. Finally, we have Noah's grandfather... he's just a dude looking for berries! All he wants is some berries! Give the man some berries!Awesome movie.",Noah

193,xlars,Disappointingly weak,3,4 April 2014,"To start with the conclusion: If you are not well founded in the Bible and know what and whom you believe on - don't watch ""Noah"" I'll tell why below. We do not know much about the historical Noah. What we know is given in Gen 5:29 through 9:28. That one is therefore forced to take some artistic license when retelling the story of Noah through a movie, goes without saying. However, let us first take a closer look at the setting of the film, the so-called Scenography. We are presented with a earth that clearly is under a curse, less yielding, mostly deserted and ""men"" is a term used exclusively to designate those of Cain's bloodline. Likewise, we are presented with mountains that are quite high, even though when Bible mentions ""mountains"" those are different. Does someone really think that the waters stood above the Himalayas?The fact that only Shem has a ""wife"" aboard the Ark is not correct either; The solution to this quandary by presenting Shem's firstborn, two twin daughters as future wives of Kham and Japheth crumbles as an argument when Kham leaves his family. And whatever happened to Noah cursing Kham?However, the storytellers has managed to lend a stamp of truth to the Pseudepigraph called ""1st Enoch"" which is solely considered legitimate among the Ethiopian Jews Beta Israel, the Ethiopian churches. (1st Enoch, is attributed to Enoch, Noah's great-grandfather,) but evidently written much, much later as an expanding Midrash, thus expounding the Bible story with additional information not found in the Bible, and that can not be proved). It tells you about the angels that fell from heaven, because ""they desired to enlighten mankind by teaching them the secrets of heaven,"" which God apparently did not want. Thus one does the feat of converting the fallen angels to ""Transformerish"" stone giants who are sentenced to a life on earth, and all human opponents, which ends up - hold on tight - to help Noah and his sons to build the ark ... and besides, also killing all the people that when it starts raining will take on board the ark. (That is, Tuvalkain, their king, manages to sneak aboard the ark as a stowaway, and being aided aboard by Kham).Noah, which is fairly well interpreted by Russell Crowe, considering a rather poor script to stick to. This we see in rather poor exchanges: Noah's wife: ""Did he (God) say anything to you?""Noah: ""I think so."" This is simply not credible. A historical figure like Noah did not ""think"" that God spoke to him. He knew God had spoken to him. Indisputably. Had he not known it with confidence, he would never taken upon himself to build the ark. Yet Russell Crowe makes a believable face when the Animals are coming two by two. He is a great actor. Truly. However, all is not entirely negative. The filmmakers have made many interesting choices, considering the very small amount of the historical information they had to build on. One especially interesting interpretation is when Tuvalkain looks up at the sky speaking haughtily to God saying, ""Why do not you talk to me?"" Viewing this in the light of the Bible's description that the last days will be like the days of Noah makes and exciting perspective. Is it possible that simple envy lies behind the fact that people turn their backs to God? Because God does not speak to ""Them""?Technically speaking the film both wins plus points and minus points. When Noah tells the creation story we are introduced to ""the serpent"" but this film reviewer experiences the serpent like a poor CGI production. When it comes to CGI graphics showing ""the deep sources that burst""; we immediately get a far better feeling of good craftsmanship. But a great film does is not borne entirely on CGI. A certain credibility in what is presented is necessary. By the way, the serpent didn't slither before after the fall. And what is this crap about Noah turning the skin of the serpent into a Tefillin?Worst of all, however, when ""Noah"" for the second time tells the story of creation, one has managed to merge it with the theory of evolution. This does not happen in mere words, but when one follows the animals from the Primordial soup via lizards and up into the trees to monkeys - and then suddenly Adam and Eve as some kind of ""Light beings"". How did they arrive at the conclusion that this is durable Scriptwriting, I do not understand, especially since evolution is based on a philosophical forgery, still 150 years after it was created - neither falsified or verified. The theory of evolution is otherwise also poked at the beginning of the film where ""men"" shoot an animal that is a mix between a lizard creature and a dog (it has scales!) to eat it. The Bible is clear that God created animals ""each after their kind"" and ""saw that it was good."" Now of course ""Noah"" is not a ""biblical"" film, but in my view should be able to expect more and better from a Jewish filmmaker like Darren Aronofsky.Sadly, therefore having to say it, but 3 is the best I can give. The reason I did not give a 1 - is that I then would be giving the movie called a qualified ""Turkey"" stamp which would have helped create a ""Cult film""""Noah"" does not deserve that.",Noah
194,toqtaqiya2,Noah is director Darren Aronofsky's best film to date.,9,5 April 2014,"If you go to see Noah don't expect just another old-fashioned Bible epic from Hollywood. The film's director is Darren Aronofsky, and this should tell you right away that Noah is complex, emotional and visually stunning. You can expect plenty of impressive visual effects, but this isn't what the film is about. It's first and foremost a character driven spectacle about Noah, his family, and people in general. Aronofsky got everything he could from the Bible story to philosophize about human nature. In addition, he expanded the story by including subplots that only improve the experience. Russell Crowe, playing Noah, leads the film admirably. Here he provides some of his best work. Noah changes in the course of the film. Crowe brings Noah to life by making him a character one can relate to. He ranges from compassionate to terrifying. Jennifer Connelly plays Noah's wife Naameh, and she gets to demonstrate how good of an actress she is. Aronofsky is known for getting good performances from actors. This skill is clearly on display in Noah. Connelly delivers the film's most impassioned, powerful speeches. Douglas Booth, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman and Leo McHugh Carroll play Noah's children. Their performances are good all around. It's Lerman though, playing Ham, who has to handle much of the drama. He provides Ham with some genuine torment and, surprisingly, makes Ham into a likable character despite his actions. Yet another famous name in the cast is Anthony Hopkins, who plays Noah's ancient, wise grandfather Methuselah. Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique give the film an otherworldly atmosphere. The Earth before the flood seems like an inhospitable alien world. Clint Mansell's music score for Noah is exceptional. It consists mostly of dreamy, elegiac, atmospheric pieces but when the action kicks in it becomes intense and brooding. What the viewer can expect from Noah is an absorbing and thought-provoking blockbuster. It may be based on a Bible story but Aronosfky delves into other themes, most notably environmentalism. I don't support environmentalism because of its elitist origins. Noah, however, is such a good film that I can easily overlook that. I definitely recommend it.",Noah
195,JPfanatic93,The fool that follows an angry god,6,20 April 2014,"You have to applaud his boldness, as Darren Aronofsky isn't afraid to seek out controversy with his first blockbuster movie. Noah's main problem is it must be faithful enough to the source material without being so religious as to scare away non-believers. Concessions to both parties had to be made, and the result is an obvious, uncomfortable attempt at making a Biblical epic feel less Biblical but no less epic.The titular character and his family live a life of vegetarian righteousness, away from the rest of mankind, the offspring of Cain, which has deteriorated into a barbaric state and devoured the natural world. Plagued by disturbing visions of humanity suffering under a great flood and inexplicable signs of the Creator – a being addressed only as such throughout the piece, as the term 'God' appears taboo – Noah seeks out his grandfather Methuselah to learn what It has in store for him. The hermit informs him that the Creator is planning on cleansing His world by water, washing away all the wickedness of man, while Noah is destined to save the innocent, the animals, from extinction. And thus Noah sets out to built a vessel to do just that.Even a man as tough as Crowe cannot hope to perform such a Herculean task by himself, but thankfully Aronofsky has added some stone giants to aid him in his divine labour. Fallen angels that were abandoned by God, they exist as beings of light trapped in volcanic rock bodies, deformed and in agony over the fact men returned their kindness with mayhem. Of course, a man as obnoxiously righteous and noble as Noah wins them over easily. These so-called Watchers help Noah to complete his task and protect the Ark they construct together. The stone giants form a welcome addition to the rather dreary Noah and his one-note family, dull to watch thus far. It's also clear that much of the budget for visual effects went into designing them, more so than the budget allocated to rendering the animals that come pouring into the Ark. Their design, which bears to mind both utterly fantastic and prehistoric creatures, compels the audience to consider Noah even more of a fantasy picture: unless Aronofsky means to take some sort of evolutionary process into account, envisioning these animals as almost their contemporary counterparts, but not quite yet.It's the human element that proves key in making us care about Noah's plight. The selfless man must confront the vicious king Tubal-Cain and his legion of followers as the rains start to fall. Winstone as always makes for an alarming villain, but there is an uneasy truth in the king's philosophical rhetoric: God made man in his image, so does that not also include his capacity for destruction? How much difference is there between a God who feels like destroying mankind to save His creation and a king who kills to feed his people? Though the resulting thunderstorm battle between Noah and the Watchers and Tubal-Cain's vast forces proves a fairly thrilling battle, it's such exploration of the nature of man and his relation to the Creator's purpose that make for Noah's most interesting aspect. Unfortunately, once the battle is over and the waters swallow the world, the film has reached its narrative climax, but Aronofsky spends another 45 minutes postponing the emotional climax, as Noah emerges as a true religious fanatic, claiming to alone understand his Creator's purpose as His chosen one. He determines that God intended for humanity to die out entirely. The only woman in his company eligible for breeding proves barren no more thanks to Methuselah's convenient magic. As his oldest son gets her pregnant, Noah makes no secret of his intention to murder her child if it's a girl. And so the noble hero degenerates into a violent misogynist. The audience quickly loses all sympathy for him. Maybe this side of Noah is what ticked off the religious audience as it wanted to make clear that not all true believers condone such homicidal, fanatical behavior. To make matters worse, the king managed to slip aboard the Ark unseen. It takes nine months for the waters to recede and Noah's crisis of faith to reach its crescendo, while the king is eating his way through the animal kingdom in the lower decks and Noah doesn't notice species dying out. Of course, Noah predictably chooses love over blind faith in the end and kills the king: and so generic Hollywood conventions triumph over Aronofsky's fascinating but at times disturbing notions on the human condition in relation to its supreme being.For those that feared Aronofsky's signature style is lost adhering to the rules of Hollywood, they can rest assured as it is only tempered. Aronofsky still gets to revel in fast cutting montages and dream sequences as before, applying the former into a neat but contextually awkward sequence of life's evolution. The director also makes wonderful use of the fabulous landscapes provided by the Iceland locations to give the viewer a sense of awe. He's also not afraid to occasionally shock the audience, illustrated by a nightmarish sequence in which Noah visits Tubal-Cain's encampment and witnesses animals being torn apart alive by hungry mobs, who have also taken to cannibalism, which shows that Tubal-Cain is not a good guy despite the truth in his words. So we are left with Noah who makes his family cry as he threatens to kill newborns on behalf of a God who destroys the world to start over, in the hopes of getting it right this time. It's ironic the studio tried to do a similar thing in the editing room to get that final cut of Noah that appeases everybody, despite the misgivings of the director who had to do all the hard work. Man failed God as was bound to happen, and Aronofksy similarly could never have succeeded in making Noah work for everybody.",Noah
196,FilmMuscle,Aronofsky's Sweeping Epic,8,29 March 2014,"A soaring epic that's set in the olden days and stars Russell Crowe? Count me in! Darren Aronofsky, one of the finest visual artists in the Hollywood game, helms an ambitious project that's based on one of the most popular excerpts from the Old Testament. Now, this is where it gets tricky because something of that accord is bound to draw plenty of religious individuals. In fact, a plethora of controversy has been stirring around this picture due to the questionability of its faithfulness to the source material. I don't seek to offend anyone in my review so I will try as hard as I can to avoid any snarky comments, but let's just say that if you're one of the many highly passionate Christians who take the Old Testament—the Bible (any religious text)— word for word, you might not appreciate this cinematic rendition of Noah's Arc as much as I did. I am not a religious man and have never read the Old Testament or any Christian texts, for that matter, before so I entered this film as a newcomer, merely anticipating a fascinating narrative. Honestly though, after witnessing Aronofsky's Noah, I'm actually interested in checking out the original story and even Adam and Eve's story—then, there's Cain, Abel, and Seth. I might not be the greatest believer, but some of this content is definitely intriguing. Anyway, Russell Crowe depicts the famous Noah who has descended from Seth's line and is destined to fulfill God's task (which has been apparently bestowed on him) and assist him in ridding the innocent and beautiful earth from the filth that has rotted it—the filth of mankind. His ultimate goal is to build an ark and save the animals from an incoming flood (God's wrathful punishment for the sins of humanity) as man is annihilated along with everything else by the roaring tides only for the world to start anew again. In essence, this is Crowe's movie, and he fully delivers, giving us one of his absolute best performances next to Maximus and John Nash. A dedicated family man's gradual descent into madness undoubtedly requires a tour-de-force of acting talent in order to entirely succeed in believability and whatnot. The rest of the ensemble (from the likes of Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone, Emma Watson, and Logan Lerman) particularly impress as well with each character having their own emotional moment or equally significant scene. I especially loved the dark nature of this classic tale for I never expected it, but as is also evident in Abraham's personal story in Binding of Isaac, religion's history possesses its own brooding periods of time. Given the lack of evidence relating to any of these occurrences though, I wish we could all choose to witness and judge Noah purely as a narrative rather than a comparison to its source material as if it was yet another adaptation of a novel or a poem. If you separate it from its textual counterpart, Noah is a marvelously-crafted and well- acted production that's also serviced by amazing production value (including some utterly memorable set pieces). As is usual with Aronofsky's work, the cinematography is simply gorgeous, coupled with astonishing metaphorical imagery. Since this account spans multiple decades, the editing is able to smoothly transition the story through the various time periods in convincing fashion; not to mention, its method of doing so is remarkably original and singularly resembles stop motion. With that being said, I found its ending to be deeply problematic as it felt unnatural and almost like a tacked-on Hollywood ending when considering the grim, unrelenting, and frightening nature that comprised the rest of the film. In other words, Noah unfortunately became another one of those films which benefit from extraordinary build-up that only results in an anti-climactic finish. Without spoiling anything, it felt like a way to appease the Christians and serve as a crowd-pleaser to the conservative crowds who couldn't bear a dramatically somber ending. Yes, the original narrative might've followed the same plot structure, but that doesn't excuse the quality in the slightest. Then, I might as well say the same thing about its original source material. The character's actions thoroughly made sense to me, and after reading of humanity's despicable acts throughout history and observing their heavily flawed characters to this very day (nothing has changed, indeed), it wholly made the character's beliefs cogent, as contentious as that might sound. Moreover, all I'm saying is that Noah's development could've led to a far more satisfying (not crowd-pleasing) end, and the story could've remained as uncompromising as it led us to initially believe. All in all, Noah is surely a technical achievement and a compelling story, but its ending certainly left me disappointed. Most importantly though, any open-minded individual can find something to enjoy in Aronofsky's latest.",Noah
197,tinovalkki,Weird,6,3 June 2014,"I am not sure what I just watched. Was it a interpretation from biblical story or was it a dystopia kind sci-fi movie? Story was so odd that it can't be straight reading from bible's Noah. That is maybe good for the movie. Melodramatic religion can be bypassed with sci-fi action and tell us a dystopic story about climate change and stupid human kind. But you can't avoid religious themes when music rumbles like in eastern morning at Vatican's St. Peter's basilica same time when monsters from Transformers slaughter thousands of peoples. 3D works quite well but hey it is almost total CGI-movie with few people in front of green screen. Russel Crowe is a good as a Noah, but there is too much effect rumble that you almost lost his presence. It's all chaos and predictable. Final result is mediocre sci-fi action with some religious feelings.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",Noah
198,danieln-15525,Simple: The movie is inaccurate and superficial,4,30 June 2018,"If they did the movie more like the originial events in the Bible it would be more beautiful. Did you know that the duration of time that Noah tried to convince the people to be righteous was 102 years? If they did it like the Bible it would ne more deep and beautiful. Instead that was just half action that didn't make much sense. For example, in the Bible, Noah knew what he should do. God told him that. Second, The creatures that were in the movie are complete nonsense that doesn't exist in the Bible at all. Third, Noah built the arc himself (the effort of building the arc, should have made up for his sins).",Noah
199,Svenstadt,A win for Aronofsky fans (and I am one of them).,8,18 May 2018,"I also do not 'get' what all the hysteria is from the religious community regarding this film. Taken by itself, the movie is actually really really good!!! But first, a plot overview for those taken aback by the biblical inconsistencies:
* The Nephilim, represented by walking Treants (living trees with branches -as-arms, human faces, etc), when fighting to protect the arc, upon death get sent to Heaven, and this rallies the rest to fight even harder; in the Bible, the Nephilim are beyond redemption permanently and cannot gain salvation. 
* God is not concerned with, in the opening scene, Noah's one son breaks the stem of a wildflower, and Noah corrects him saying not to destroy the nature that God created; in the Bible, God would not have cared if anyone had done this!!
* Tubal-cain, played brilliantly by Ray Winstone, is the bad guy, trying to sneak onto the Arc (and eventually gets there, by befriending Ham, the 'bad' son of Noah, who gets fooled by Tubal-Cain). This character would mostly be historically accurate, if not for the fact that his only 'sin' portrayed is being overly-zealous and rallying an army with steel weapons to produce siege weaponry. Again, God could care less if trees were cut down to make any sort of technology to be used - God said to A. & E. in the garden, ""This garden is yours to do with as you see fit. The birds of the air, the ground, all is yours to live off of as you see fit (paraphrasing).
* Noah was never tested by God to sacrifice one of his new-born sons!! Abraham, however, was, in similar fashion; but in the movie, God really meant for Noah to kill his newborn - in the Bible, the command to Abraham was only a test of loyalty and the child was stopped from being sacrificed!!
 The beginning of the film starts off with, as I said, one son (I forget which) breaking off a wildflower stem. Then Noah and his family move along, over a very nicely done backdrop of a destroyed wasteland with few resources. They encounter some trouble from strangers and fight. Character of Shem is introduced who has a fiance, Emma 'The Amazing' Watson, and shows a few scenes involving those two. There is a grandfather, Methuselah, who uses his God-granted power of Healing Touch (this is an accurate portrayal of a power true Christians have), causes her to overcome her infertility and directs her to seduce Shem at this time to conceive. I am particularly struck by, how for a movie so Biblically inaccurate, there are some moments that get the culture of the day right, and the previously mentioned scene is particularly tear-jerking and powerful!!! Next, these Nephilim agree to help Noah build the arc (inaccurate), and fight off Tubal-Cain's armies of, I call them the 'unwashed masses' of angry men (inaccurate). Around this time, there is a scramble to get Shem and his fiance, late to arrive, onto the arc. Next, a number of Nephilim begin to die. At around this time, Tubal-Cain manages to enter the arc through a hidden spot around the back, and narrowly avoids the flood. 
Anyways, the film ends with Noah disobeying God by not having the gall to kill his own son. (inaccurate - God was against child sacrifice). 
My only critique of this film is that the character of Tubal-cain is introduced as kind of a one-dimensional character, a typical - we would call today- kind of a thuggish street tough. His leadership abilities are shown, as he rallies his men with am empassioned speech, but really not much jealously from him or personal struggles shown. It never shows anything Tubal-Cain actually did wrong; I was expecting them to show some massively wicked guy. Noah and his family are however greatly complex. I don't know if this is a flaw or if it was intentional - just something I noted. Jennifer Connelly plays Noah's wife, and a great deal of Noah's consciousness are focused on her as she goes over the struggles they are facing with the family aboard the arc. Perhaps a 9 is in order. Perhaps not. Still one of the more memorable films I've seen.
On a side note: I am also a fan of Aronofsky's The Wrestler. I have yet to review it, but it was funny to see Todd Barry playing the wrestler's boss as he works at a supermarket, a side job to his wrestling career. He constantly jabs him in a way only Todd Barry could pull off, it is hilarious!!",Noah
200,jaredpahl,Thank God for Filmmaking Like This!,9,6 October 2019,"Darren Aronofsky's gonzo biblical epic, Noah, is the type of bizarre, controversial, thought provoking passion project that Hollywood studios have always been terrified of. It's for good reason. Strangeness is an enemy of audience enthusiasm. But where we're used to weird, experimental films of modest scope and ambition, Noah is one writ large. Really large. Here is an epic of extraordinary vision. A work of intelligent insanity that brims with ideas and thrills with images of terrifying power. Noah is as ballsy a blockbuster as you're likely to ever see. A Bible story that throws out the rule book and goes for broke. It's shocking, stunning, awesome, and thank the Lord it actually got made.Noah uses the book of Genesis as a thematic guide and not necessarily for structure. This Noah's ark story is more closely related to action epics like 300 or The Lord of the Rings than it is to The Ten Commandments. Russell Crowe plays Noah, a man burdened by God with the foresight of impending apocalypse and a calling to save creation from the great sinning horde. What is in the Bible a simple parable is expanded by Aronofsky into an involving epic of a conflicted hero. Aronofsky and Ari Handel's script is highly interpretive, inventing strange wonders like the fallen angels encased in rock that help in Noah's mission, and expanding on the humans God saw fit to punish. It's a story with monsters and brutality, mysticism and violence, and it almost feels sacrilegious. But Aronofsky uses the Bible in important ways. He takes the words seriously. Noah, the movie, genuinely considers its character's dilemmas. Is it a sin to punish others in the name of God? If it is God's will to punish humanity, is the act of continuing on a mortal sin? Is humanity worth saving? Those are heavy theological questions, and here is a movie with the courage to ask them. A religious person could look at the surface of Noah, with its magic realism and its black heart, and find it blasphemous. However, watching the film and thinking about it intelligently actually provides a greater context through which to interpret the Bible. It's a faith-based movie that doesn't comfort or coddle, but challenges and strengthens one's faith.The way Aronofsky visualizes his action-packed theological meditation is the demented genius of Noah. The storybook Noah's ark, with its sunny skies and kindly protector are nowhere close. The Darren Aronofsky version of the world of Genesis is alien beauty and pure nightmare. Noah is a truly visionary spectacle. In image after image, I found myself floored by Aronofsky's audacity. Consider some of these sequences: An otherworldly sunset meteor shower, a creation montage that boldly traces the entirety of evolution on Earth, and an apocalyptic vision of the flood more gutturally horrifying than any I've ever seen. Here is powerful visual filmmaking, done with a kind of surging bravado only a director like Aronofsky can pull off. Even in the action scenes, Noah feels like a living dream. There are sounds and images in the film's battles that are as thrilling as any in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and they materialize the thunderous, awesome power of the Old Testament God to stunning effect.Anchoring what begins as a conflicted hero's journey and shifts into an intense family drama is Crowe. Sturdy but internally petrified, Crowe gives a difficult character one of his very best performances. The same can be said for Jennifer Connelly as Naameh, who provides the deepest emotional connection of the film, or Ray Winstone as the face of human depravity and sin. The movie is made up of raw human emotion and the actors bring everything they have to it.Noah is a gift. In a movie landscape that gets safer and smaller every week, a film with its scope and reckless creative freedom is all the more valuable. Let others praise blockbusters that placate the senses and dull the mind. I'll stand up for a movie with the cajones to turn the story of Noah's ark into a thoughtful, smart, bloody, insane action epic unlike anything else.94/100",Noah
201,martinpersson97,An underrated masterpiece,10,23 August 2019,"The term ""underrated"" is not one I often use, but in this case, it's the best phrase I can think of. Darren Aronofsky is one of my favorite directors, and I've loved all of his movies, so I decided to give it a shot. And I was not disappointed.The movie tells the well-known story of the bible in which Noah is given a task by God to take all pairs of animals to safety when a river that will doom man approaches.Granted, not being a believing Christian, I am not too familiar with the details of the story, but from what I know, the movie told it rather well, and in an exciting fashion, none the less. The world in this movie feels very mysterious and alive, supernatural events are mixed well with known history and makes it believable that this actually might have happened in some capacity.Russel Crowe delivers one of the best performances of his career in this one, and you really learn to empathise with Noah, even in his darker moments, and the ending of the movie is both beautiful and heart-breaking. The rest of the enesemble is really strong as well, with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. All of which play great characters.The visuals of this movie are simply marvelous, as stated above, this world truly comes alive thanks to the strong cinematography. The CGI for the Stone Giants is fantastic and you can't help but wonder if they are actually there when seeing them.Overall, this is a fantastic movie with fantastic performances and a great scope. Aronofsky delivers again in perhaps one of his best movies, and it's a shame lots of people doesn't like this.I can't give it less then a 10 out of 10, this is truly a masterpiece!",Noah
202,WatchedAllMovies,A mediocre twist to the biblical story,6,6 August 2014,"This is a spiced-up Noah ark movie. There are monsters, villains, romance, etc.However, it makes the Noah character unreasonable and unlikeable.There is heavy focus on finding mates for the younger generation. During that era, it seems women are not easy to come by. So why not share the available women? Another twist added to the movie is the animals come voluntarily to the ark, and are then put to sleep using some sort of smoke, which strangely does not affect humans. I guess this addition is to explain away how they don't have to feed the animals or take care of their waste.There is also a grandfather, who has magical power but for some reason lives alone and far away from Noah. It's not as if they hate each other.Noah seems to get older and older then younger again as time passes. Noah's wife looks the same age throughout the years.Ila doesn't behave normally. When Noah is about to kill her babies, normal people would run. She just stands there and say ""make it quick"".Overall the story seems hastily put together. They are banking on famous actors and special effects to sell the movie.BTW Russell Crowe hasn't improved his singing since Les Misérables.",Noah
203,jakob13,A strong Crowe,9,20 November 2014,"Like the god of the Torah, Darren Aronofosky looks upon mankind in a brooding frame of mind.

As such, as plain as the nose of his own face,he feels that we are hurtling towards finality in violent climate change.And so he has ventured into biblical fantasy to tell his tale of fury and terrible meaning in his $130m blockbuster Noah.It isn't for nothing that, as if by accident the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2610-page report was issued just before Noah's release, foreseeing ""impacts of global warming getting out of control, threatening economic growth and causing, among other things, droughts and arctic vortexes, uncontrolled hurricanes and floods,"" as outward signs that the world as we know it fast spinning towards a cataclysm of biblical proportions.And Aronofsky has found his cautionary tale, once, perhaps, told to us on our grandfather's knee, in Genesis (chapters 6-9) and retold in the Koran's Sura 71. It is a simple story of the creator's disgust with his creation that he is willing to destroy it by a great flood. As an exemplar of righteousness, the 10 pre-flood patriarch Noah as his chosen instrument.With the omnipotence of a cinematic god, Aronofsky's film expresses revulsion of what man is doing to his environment—as though he were living the last hours of the world as he knows it—with an insouciance in defiance to the dire consequences the future holds for him.In Russell Crowe, the filmmaker has found his Noah; an interpreter of his god's commands, to make matters right, no matter come what may. Rugged in feature, prickly like a pear, he is living in a world that is brutish, full of wickedness, unrepentant and worthy of god's wrath and destruction.Commanded to build an ark, he is aided by watcher angels—angels that a jealous god threw out of the heavens because they took pity of the our expelled ""parents"" from the Garden of Eden—in this task. Here Aronofsky takes liberty in reading the story of Noah. For, these watchers, referenced in the Mishna's Daniel have not lost their holiness. And in his fanciful imagination, they look as though in form and substance, they stepped out of The Transformers.Water, as the bible tells us, plays a central role in Noah. Aronofsky has used it exceptionally well in his montage: a small geyser gushes from the earth; it becomes streamlets that separates into a steady flow of waters, then widens into larger streams and then into rushing rivers, as they aliment a parched earth, that sprouts a forest of mighty trees the wood of which will become the cubits of the ark.Noah deftly uses digital special effects to its advantage: the ""apple"" of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the seductive, hissing serpent, the flocks of birds, the slithering army of serpents as the glide en masse into the ark, the thundering, large moving of animals as they are intuitively driven towards the ark built for their survival during the flood.Ingeniously, Noah and his wife Naameh, sister of the film's villain Tubal-Cain come up with a solution of quieting what would be an orchestra of jarring, discordant sounds and smells: a vapor that induces sleep until the day the ark lands again on land.No humans allowed but Noah, his wife and his three sons—Shem, Ham and Japeth—and Shem's wife, Ila who is with child, as well as Tubal-Cain in Aronofsky's telling. So driven is Crowe to obey his god's authority, he is of Jesuit-like belief that when the waters have subsided and the world is born again, only wild animals living in the undomesticated state will survive the deluge, not any of Noah's offspring and descendants. In temperament Noah channels the anger of his god intent in destroying the fruit of his creation.The Old Testament is proof of divine wrath, which runs like a red thread even unto its last book Job. Man suffers his maker's justice and unwarranted sufferings to justify a god's sense of almightiness.Noah falters in his ultimate purpose, sparing his offspring who will ""repopulate"" a cleansed and chastened planet. In doing so, Noah has pulled the curtain on a god jealous of his powers, Does his decision plead for the right of man to exercise ""free will?"" The filmmaker makes reference to Noah's drunkenness and nakedness his son Ham saw. It is to his credit that he chose not to hold that Ham's indiscretion as ""a black sin,"" that literal bible readers interpret as a curse on dark skinned people, that has justified slavery and given grist to racists mills. Anthony Hopkins gives a comic turn as Noah's long-lived grandfather Methuselah. Even though Aronofsky says he is an atheist, he doesn't deviate from Judaic practices: Nosh, in passing his birthright to Shem, wraps around his left arm a strip of cloth, passed down from one pre-flood prophet to another,as though it were tefillin, a practice of orthodox Jews. Once again, he resorts to poetic license in using the Torah for his own devices, and in that way, heighten the ""majesty"" of his biblical epoch that he hopes speaks to our condition today.",Noah
204,patsworld,Calling Noah A Biblical Epic Is A Joke,5,3 April 2014,"Excuse me, but has anyone who has ever read the Bible seen this fiasco? Here's a tip, when you have an atheist behind a film, you end up with an atheistic slant on things. This particular mess blends in Black Magic and just about every silly thing you can think of to end up with a huge, enormous joke. Dark, dull, and dreary. Crowe, doing his usual bigger than life over-acting just doesn't cut it as Noah. And what on earth are those massive enormous, lumbering creatures..oh, sure, I recall them from the Bible. This is not en epic anything, let alone a Biblical event. My advice – skip it. If you want to see a Fantasy movie, there are better ones out there. If you want to see something Bible-based, there are most certainly better ones out there. This is neither, nor in spite of the heavy media pump-up, particularly good. Save your time and your money!",Noah
205,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: A brand new Noah,7,31 March 2014,"The trailers for Noah would lead one to believe that the film is an epic bible story and with all the strides made with computer generated imagery this would have to be a marvel to watch when the flood waters began to rise. The thing that I toiled with is whether it actually should be considered a bible story. It seemed as if the biblical names including the title player Noah (Russell Crowe) and the flood were what made this supposedly biblical. The first thirty minutes or so I just couldn't get past the feeling that this was a Sci-Fi or Fantasy story, because the film had such an otherworldly feel to it. There were some truly inspired CGI sequences like when all that creeps and crawls came to the arc, the arc itself and the geyser explosions, however I was less impressed by the snake in the garden and a little perplexed by the armadog. I guess his appearance was to say that man was not the only creature without innocence and it too must have perished. We just didn't know anything about it and any remains must be buried deep beneath the sea. This is where I had issues with some of the creative license taken in the storytelling, if it is based on a story that I am familiar with, I prefer that it is very closely knit to the known accounts. I will say I was all in with the characters and the actors ability to bring truth to their portrayals. Most noteworthy was Ila (Emma Watson), when she cried I cried. Like I said I was all in. I enjoyed the movie, therefore I surmised that anything that was unfamiliar to me in the storytelling was to fill in the blanks within the historical account. Like given the enormity of the size of the arc, Noah and his family must have had some help, this film identifies the helpers. Even though this must have been a story of Noah that happened in another galaxy far, far away I'd consider seeing it again, and that is truly the test for a worthwhile film.",Noah
206,bravesfanc,not what I expected,5,12 July 2014,"Before viewing this I went in with an open mind because I had read all the negative reviews and negative articles about how this has nothing to do with the actual story of Noah and The Arc. Being a Christian myself, I know the gist of what happens because I learned it at Church and Sunday School. However, I don't know the exact story in detail and for that I wasn't going to be overly critical in any way.I'm not sure if in the Bible that Noah is somewhat of a depressed and angry man. But in this movie, while he starts out as a family man and someone you like he quickly changes his ways of thinking. Instead of believing that God chose him to save the animals and his family, he starts to believe that God is not only punishing mankind, but his family as well. And that at the end, they will all also die. It becomes complicated when Emma Watson's character becomes pregnant and he can't seem to think why God would do that.The action scenes are OK at best and only some of the special effects are great to look at. The angels or guardians in the movie that are made of rock look straight out of a 1970's sci/fy movie. In any movie I watch, I want to care about the main character. Noah seems a bit blinded by what is happening and you start to lose interest. His family is quite likable and the interactions between Noah and his family are the better parts of the film.Overall I think it was a bit too long and I was a little too bored towards the end. Not a terrible movie but nothing great.",Noah
207,gerry_barnaby,A very powerful Message in life & a fantastic film,9,4 April 2014,"wow every review on this film by people say this is not the story of Noah or this was a big disappointment I'm guess these people are Christian born or have something to hide because there was a clear message in this film i for one think this shows the real story of Noah & not what some bible Say's seeing that this was a fictional story in the first place that make sense in this world today. This is a brilliant, compelling, challenging, thought-provoking, enjoyable film.it holds no punches in tell the full story that Christian church complete hide, if your offended by this film then you clear have seen yourself on one side or he other. It's emotional at several points that bring a tear to your eyes. It provoked lively discussion with people because its basically saying all those that crave power,greed & do evil things, try to control people through fear are corrupted & the descendants of Cain.The film takes utterly seriously the Judeo-Christian belief in God, God's relationship with creation, and the faith assertions of the Genesis stories of early human civilization tell the true story that has always been hide because the 3rd son of Adam & eve is never mentioned Seth. Seth descendants are know as spiritualism people that will not given in to corruption or power, they take care of the people around them & every-living creature on this planet, it wasn't until Cain evil corruption in this world, this world because evil, but there are still descendants of Seth in this world willing to save the world of this evil. This film basically is saying god gave the world a gift of life, it was Adam that gave in to temptation & created evil that created the corruption in the world upon seeing this the first angels of light defied the rules of interfering try to help the human race build but the corruption corrupted them they were dammed by god to live on earth as watchers, until such time a Seth descendant will come along to save the Innocent & the corrupt, evil power driven people will die in the end of the world, so live can be restarted & done right. I see this film has no lies in contradiction to Genesis 6-9, and that's the only thing that matters: remember, ""the one who is not against me is for me."" Yes, folks, the ""rock monsters"" you've heard aboutclearly a wonderfully creative attempt to render fallen angels make sense of the delightfully enigmatic ""Nephilim"" of Genesis 6 and Numbers 13.One voiced by real-life ""rock-monster"" Nick Nolte brilliant done as they all had their own character's, There is also the sense of a sort of living Biblical exegesis on screen: the touching scenes of Noah his family representing something of the hope God had for what humans race was meant to be, and conversely, the scenes of Tubal-Cain's self-centered, destructive, broken humanity, played brilliantly by Ray Winstone Jennifer Connelly as Noah's wife is crucial in this film as she was a grounded person in Noah life to show him a way not to become corrupted, she was fantastic in this film. Emma Watson great performance as a young woman whose change in destiny serves as an object lesson in the importance of women's roles in a future of man kind after the flood. There is at one point of this film you get a scene, relatively brief and experienced from Noah's viewpoint of how far the human race as fallen in human savagery and violence in a society hopelessly broken down, that packs the punch of any horror film out, that personally qualifies as a way to visualize Hell on earth. Russell crowes performance as Noah was nothing short of brilliance, the emotions, stress the worries of defending his family & trying not to fail god plan with the one scene where he try's to talk to god for an answer that acting right there is completely why Russell crowe is one of thee best actors of all time.This is a film i highly recommend you watch.",Noah
208,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn! review,6,21 April 2014,"'Noah' is definitely one of the strangest movies that came out this year. Not only is it controversial (the movie is banned in several countries and it spawned countless internet arguments between Christians and atheists), but it also feels like a weird step in the, otherwise very successful, career of Darren Aronofsky. Apparently, Aronofsky, in spite of being an atheist, has had a fascination with the biblical character of Noah since childhood and really wanted to do this movie. Ironically, his dream project turned out to be his weakest movie yet, and overall a very uneven experience.When Adam and Eve were cast out of Eden, they had three sons – Cain, Abel and Seth. One day Cain slew his brother Abel and fled from his parents and God (who is referred only as The Creator) to some land where he started having children and being the father of people. However, unlike the people who were born in the line of Seth, people who were born in the line of Cain were mostly evil and corrupt. Noah (Russell Crowe) is one of the descendants of Seth and he starts having visions of a great flood that will purify the Earth. He soon realizes he is receiving messaged from the Creator that tell him to construct a giant ark in which he'll put two of every animal species in the world and sail until the flood withdraws, so he could start the human civilization anew.'Noah's' story has many aspects to it; aspects that seem quite disconnected from each other and should be analyzed separately. First, there is the biblical aspect of the story, which was done alright – it was nice to see this biblical tale on a big budget, grand scale, accompanied by an A-list cast (of which Jennifer Connelly stands out the most as Noah's wife Naameh, and, absurdly, Russell Crowe stands out the least as the titular character – throughout the whole movie he had the same facial expression) and a clearly talented director (the movie is absolutely beautiful, with wonderful shots and interesting visuals).Then there is the 'realistic' aspect of the story, which was the most interesting one. The character of Noah is portrayed as a troubled figure, who is disturbed by the choices he has to make. His family is no different – all of the members have their own separate problems they have to deal with. This realistic/dramatic/human aspect somewhat differs from the biblical tale, but was nonetheless the most fascinating thing about the movie. This aspect was pleasantly utilized through the movie's more or less talented cast - the exceptions were Russell Crowe, whom I mentioned before, and Douglas Booth, who was quite forgettable as Noah's son Shem.And the last aspect of 'Noah' that should be commented was its 'fantasy' aspect, which was horrible and almost destroyed the whole movie. Inputting completely made up elements in the movie, like stone giants (yes, stone giants) and magic stones not only underwhelms the movie's 'dramatic' aspect, but also wrecks its source material. Add to that the ridiculous comic-book style rivalry between Noah and the movie's villain Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) and the occasionally clingy CGI, and 'Noah' doesn't rise much above the flood of generic action, big budget movies.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",Noah
209,alahmed-55673,Fictional. Almost nothing is true but enjoyable,7,26 November 2020,"Although the story has a lot of flaws. A lot of things are not based on the real truth events that happened, Which the Quran has stated. Not even the bible.I enjoyed the film. I enjoyed it until there was 50 minutes left until the bad guy which is the king invaded the ark without noah knowing and started eating their animals.I also disliked that noah refused one of his sons attempt to tried to bring one girl to the ark with him so that he could marry her etc etc.I also disliked that the film is showing Noah as a bit stubborn and ignorant. The show made the character say if if I had a granddaughter I would kill her if I had a grandson i would keep him. (And then he did not kill them) (but still only saying it is bad)",Noah
210,vistheindian,an epic with too many leaking holes,6,13 April 2014,"Quickie Review:Noah is a new epic that is based on the biblical story, and helmed by director Darren Aronofsky. The story is about a man who is tasked with building an ark to save the innocent, from the cleansing of the world by a great flood. With a stellar cast of Russell Crowe (Noah), Jennifer Connelly (Naameh), Ray Winstone (Tubal-cain), Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Anthony Hopkins, and Nick Nolte, Noah truly had everything right to be an incredible movie. Unfortunately, the pacing of the third act falters and all the character development of the main cast is spiked up to the extreme, rendering them completely un-relatable. In the end, this is quite a forgettable movie that doesn't need to be seen from a purely movie quality perspective.Full Review:I feel that I should state this before I go any further – I do not affiliate myself with any religion, nor am I against religion. This review comes purely from someone who loves movies in general. Nothing more, nothing less.With that out of the way, let's move on with the review. In the movie, Noah (Russell Crowe) lives in a dark world that is corrupted by wickedness. He receives messages from the creator, showing him visions of a great flood that covers the whole world. Noah must now build an ark with his family to save the innocent (all wildlife other than mankind).I'll start off with some things that I did like about this movie. Normally Darren Aronofsky is known for tackling deeply personal stories that are more of a character study. It is nice to see him break from his norm and make a movie of a much grander scale, while still bringing his touch when it comes to developing his characters, especially with Noah. Russell Crowe should also be commended for his great performance. Just from his facial expression, you can tell how much burden he feels weighing on his shoulders. The world that is created is extremely well realized. The atmosphere is dark and drab, and you really feel the rotting air of the world. Overall the movie was captivating and well- paced right up until the third act, after the flood scene.Third act is really where everything just falls apart. Now I won't spoil anything, for anyone who wants to watch the movie. Still I need to mention few things to explain why things go wrong for this movie. For some reason the whole cast makes a sudden shift from balanced and complex characters, to be completely driven and defined by their base instincts. So for example, Noah becomes completely blinded by his devotion and divine purpose that he almost becomes villainous. These changes in character comes so suddenly that it feels out of place. Also the movie comes to such a snail crawling pace that I felt the need to check my watch a few times.This was a movie that had the potential to be a great character driven movie, set in an epic scale. It did show this promise for the most part in the beginning. However, a sudden change in tone and pacing issues ended up making it feel like it was dragging on. I say skip this movie, because even if you watch it, you will forget about it in a few days.",Noah
211,CowherPowerForever,You stand alone and defy me? I'm not alone!,7,31 March 2014,"Well the firestorm this film had behind its release was fierce, and in fact it still has not stopped. As a Christian myself, and one who loves films, I didn't take this film nor its story very seriously when news of the film first broke. What I mean by that is I knew Hollywood wouldn't bring us a perfect adaption of Noah's story. Frankly that is fine by me. The underlying message that is key for everyone to take from the film still stands even though the film does not follow scripture piece for piece.Most of us who found interest in this film likely know the story of Noah. Darren Aronofsky(director and writer) however found need for a main villain as well as so called rock giants to help protect Noah from Tubal-cain(play by Ray Winstone). Frankly this doesn't bother me at all. It is just something used to spice up the story. It, at least in my opinion, is not meant to attack us religious people. At the heart of this story is a very good message. That evil is overpowering, but we alone have free will to decide what is right and what is wrong. Frankly my only major complaints of the script from Aronofsky and his co-writer Ari Handel is that the story feels rushed. With a runtime of just about two hours and ten minutes they start the flood scenes with an hour. There could have been much better story development in the first half of the film.Director Darren Aronofsky handles the effects of the film very nicely. With a few fast paced shots that go by like a blur its mostly amazing. Aronofsky is use to directing mostly non CG films. In this film of course much more needed to be used. I do not fault him for the use of CG, and frankly it was used perfectly. However Aronofsky loses me in the key part of the acting. Nearly every character uses whatever accent they so well choose. A lot of mixing and matching going on throughout the film. The director has to know better, and get his actors in line. While the performances of actors such as Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone, and Emma Watson are amazing, you have to wonder if these characters are even related or if they are even from the same region. Were they dropped from the sky and landed there? The Mel Gibson approach would have added so much to film film. What that basically is is use the language of the area the story takes place in. The story of Noah takes place near the Euphrates river so an Arabic language would have fit much better and would have kept the characters grounded to the film they were making.Overall I have a few minor problems with the film here and there, but I think mostly its an enjoyable film to enjoy for both the religious, and the non religious. It is a truly uplifting message for everyone, and one that even the truest biblical films carry with them. A must see at the theaters. No need to wait for a rental here.",Noah
212,williambendavis-933-218958,"Not great, not awful, but in the end rather boring",4,17 June 2015,"This movie didn't really do it for me really. It didn't make any enormous mistakes and you could end up enjoying it actually. The whole film was just so boring to me. Trying to stretch a story that can be written in one or two pages has its problems. There just wasn't enough source material for this to work. I mean God tells this guy Noah to build a boat. He does it. There's a flood. The end. Really doesn't work with a nearly two and a half hour runtime. Noah was a real asshole as well, which annoyed the hell out of me the whole movie. It's not all bad though. The special effects are nicely done and it is competently made. It isn't poorly acted or directed, so it isn't unwatchable. The big issue is the boredom. I can see people going either way with this film. Didn't do it for me though. I still say give it a shot. You may end up enjoying it.",Noah

214,japamo,Tolkeinesque Elements Flesh Out a Well-Known But Sketchy Biblical Tale Into Both a Faithful and Entertaining Epic,8,14 April 2014,"Not just Darren Aronofsky, director of ""Noah"", but practically all directors and movie industry members attempting to bring Biblical stories to the screen walk a tightrope tethered between ""faithful authenticity"" and ""rousing enjoyment"". Usually, in my opinion, movie creators cave in to religious authenticity in their fearful desire to attract and placate both truly and sanctimoniously devout people at the risk of turning out a bland, lifeless, predictable product. These movie creators seem to concede that it's just too damn hard to create both a respectful and exciting epic. I argue that Aronofsky has succeeded in doing just that in ""Noah"", and he's an atheist to boot! The basic structure and components of the Old Testament mythological ""Noah and the Flood"" are largely intact. Granted, the tale itself is relatively straightforward and skeletal, but this works to Aronofsky's advantage because he can introduce various subplots and previously peripheral characters to flesh out and fortify the story and make it really feel like an epic without mangling the story beyond recognition. As I see them, these are the steps Aronofsky took to achieve this: 1) As other reviewers have noted, Aronofsky has taken a Tolkeinesque approach to this material, including showing desolate wastelands, fantastic characters, miraculous events, and a daunting quest from a supernatural figure called the Creator.2) Making Noah (Russell Crowe), a man charged by the Creator with saving the non-human world from an impending flood, not only a devout, Creator-heeding and family-loving man, but also a virile, resolute man of action who will do just about anything to carry out his divine mission.3) In a slight but not fatal deviation from the text, ""Noah"" introduces a subplot involving Noah's second-oldest son Ham's (Logan Lerman's) struggle with asserting his manhood and avoiding a lonely bachelorhood.4) Introducing the misshapen Watchers (who look like Transformers with a granite exo-skeleton), who ARE referenced in the Bible, as former angels cast from Heaven for aiding sinful humanity (how Promethean!) and condemned to wear a rocky skin. Despite their ordeal, several Watchers agree to help Noah with building the ark to carry the world's animals and protecting the vessel from the rest of humanity. No matter what you think, it's an imaginative, impressive way of explaining how Noah and only a few family members could fashion and preserve such a colossal vessel.5) Including the aged but still lively patriarch Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins), Noah's grandfather, who gives his sometimes confused grandson sage advice and moral support, and even aids Noah's daughter-in-law and son Shem's (Douglas Booth's) wife Ila (Emma Watson) with a troubling family problem. And in return, all Methuselah asks is to satisfy a berry jones.6) Adding the character of Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone), a ferociously warlike (and carnivorous) descendant of the world's first murderer, Cain, and apparent leader of the sinful hordes who attempt to battle for passage into the ark. When the hordes fail, Tubal-cain selfishly manages to stowaway on the ark and try to manipulate Ham's frustration to avenge himself on archnemesis Noah.7) Exploring the extent of Noah's religious zeal, which flirts with the rationalization that he and his family, including loyal, passionate but sturdy wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly, who reminds me a lot of Demi Moore), young Japheth, and even, shockingly, Ila's newborn twins, must also die after saving the animals to fulfill the Creator's mission.People may object to Aronofsky's stylistic flourishes in Noah as being disrespectful to the Bible, unbelievable, or just plain silly. I suppose arguments could be made for each of these viewpoints. Still, I feel that although ""Noah"" realizes and accepts that all Biblical/mythological stories relying on supernatural events can seem ridiculously hard to swallow, it ultimately adheres to the story's spirit AND marvels and respects at all that the Creator (God) has made, and manages to be dynamic, rip-roaring, and surprising, too.P.S.: My mother, who is a Greek Orthodox Christian, also approved of and enjoyed ""Noah"". Therefore, I respectfully recommend that ""Noah"" purists, religious or otherwise, relax and not be so resistant to the movie's message.",Noah
215,mitchell5954,"Okay, but I Expected More",6,30 March 2014,"Noah is a film that I was really looking forward to seeing. I saw the trailers last year and I thought this would be a new, updated, and exciting take on the Noah's Ark story. It had Russell Crowe and Emma Watson who are two actors I really like. The effects looked amazing and it looked like an action-packed version of the story. When I finally saw the film I was slightly disappointed. I thought the film was decent but I was expecting it to be an amazing epic. I will say that if you are a devote religious person who wanted this to stick to the conventional Noah story of the Bible then do not even bother seeing this. This film definitely takes several liberties, but I expected it from seeing the trailer. It is a movie after all, and while I am Catholic I do not value the Bible to the point where I would not want it being reinterpreted in any way.The story is quite simple. Mankind has all but destroyed the world so God will cleanse the world with a massive flood. He tells this to Noah via a dream. Noah and his family then have to build an ark, survive the flood, and ensure that every species of animal survives as well. It is basically what the Bible version is all about. However, there are noticeable liberties taken. For example, Noah and his family are aided in building the ark by giant rock creatures called The Watchers. They are Fallen Angels grounded on Earth by God for disobeying him.The film does do many things right. Most of the effects looked pretty good. I loved the scale of the film. Some of the action scenes are pretty decent. The actors all do a good job. Russell Crowe gave his best performance in a while, in my opinion. Also I really like this interpretation of Noah. I like that he is a conflicted, angry, distant, and sometimes, scary individual who struggles between what ""The Creator"" wants him to do and caring for his family. I liked his character ark.I also liked the concept of The Watchers. Though I do not like how they look and they are different from the source material, I think they are the most interesting aspect of the movie. I also like their character arks in the film. For those who do not know The Watchers are not a part of the Noah story in the Bible. They come from a biblical story not included in the Bible called the Book of Enoch. In fact the movie even mentions Enoch at one point. In that story The Watchers are Fallen Angels that came to Earth and mated with some humans and in turn created these giant monsters that wreaked havoc on humanity. It is that reason that God sent the flood. That is not what happens here, but I thought the story we got still worked.However, the film does have its share of faults that bring the movie down for me. While most of the effects look good some do look off. The most notable bad effect is the Watchers themselves. When I first heard that they would be giant rock creatures I was face-palming. However, when we got the back-story of The Watchers it did make sense. However, they still looked fake and bad. They could have done better with the effects.The film also gets boring in places. There are many places where the film drags and could have been cut a little. I loved the first 15-20 minutes of the film. However, once they started building the Ark the filmed dragged and got a bit boring. Then the film picked up when the flood started and the big battle happened. When they were on the ark the filmed dragged a bit again because everyone was just sitting around waiting for the rain to stop. Then there was a fight with the main villain and the film picked up again. Then we get to the ending which also dragged too much.Also, I do not care many of the characters. Anthony Hopkins was wasted in this film. He is barely in it. His character had a lot of hype in the beginning but he does not do much and dies in a stupid way. Noah's family is not that interesting. I like Emma Watson and she does a good job performance-wise. However, her character I found not to be that interesting. The only character in Noah's family (and in the film in general) besides Noah himself is his son named Ham. I found his dilemma interesting, but Ham himself is not an interesting character.There is not that much action in it. If you are expecting a big action film like the trailer promised then you will be disappointed. There is not that much action in it. There is only one big battle. While the action scenes we got were decent I have seen better in other period movies. The villain is lame as well. I like the actor who played him, but he came off as more of a minor nuisance than an actual threat. Noah came off as more threatening than he did. That's bad when the hero comes off as more of a villain at times then the villain.Overall, Noah is an okay movie. Do not go in expecting a great movie and you should be fine. If you keep an open mind then there are things to be enjoyed here. If you are an extremely devote religious person then you should not see this. Do not expect a big action movie out of this either.",Noah
216,AJ4F,We don't need MORE literal Creationism,5,17 October 2014,"I find it funny that people are criticizing this movie as a confusing interpretation when the original Genesis story is so implausible and unscientific.There's still no evidence for a global flood, only distant memories of one that may have occurred near the Black Sea when people thought that region encompassed the whole planet.I was glad to see the old Bible fable distorted a bit, especially in this age when science-denial is becoming a crime and Creationism has no place in public policy.I gave this a 5 because it wasn't quite as ridiculous as the original Genesis myth.",Noah
217,jimlacy2003,Just wonderful! A must see.,8,13 July 2014,"First, I'm surprised coming here right off the bat I see several negative reviews. But then on second thought this is to be expected as it probably touches on a lot of peoples core religious beliefs here in the USA. Plus they obviously took some ""creative freedom"" here and there to spice things up. A lot of things in the movie I don't recall were part in my Sunday school teachings when I was a kid. But then this is to be expected with the trend these days to make most movies a way over the top, non-stop roller coaster thrill ride. One can only imagine what the Charlton Heston classic ""The Ten Commandments"" would be like if it were made today; you know it it would have been embellished with too many CGI effects.Furthermore, being a spiritual person and respecting most religious ways of people et al, the fact is a lot of of the more extremists and other weak willed people will go out of their way to condemn such a movie unless it has their churches official stamp of approval. I can see it now, the pastor saying ""the movie is the devils work!"", followed by the congrigation blindly chanting ""amen brother!"". You know it's true and if this statement offends you, well yes, sorry, it's still the truth..Now, I found the movie to be entertaining, enthralling, and even spiritual at times as well. Overall thought it had a nice positive message to it. Capturing the key virtues of love, courage, forgiveness, faith, etc., that are unarguably good traits in any human being (regardless of any specific religious believes).In particular of note where the excellent performances of Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Watson, etc. They really ""brought it"", their ""a-game"". All of which in my opinion are Oscar worthy, but ultimately I doubt the academy will go for it being the majority are so conservatively liberal, but then who knows.Great movie, a must see!",Noah
218,cattjones,Great Acting,8,8 April 2014,"This ain't your momma's bible story! The one thing that I did want to mention is that I saw in an interview where they stated that the ark was built to scale. No green-screening the ark. It even survived hurricane Sandy. I wonder what the heck they did with that thing after the film was complete. Maybe turned it into a homeless shelter?? Some of the CGI was pretty amazing; like the actual flood. However, some of it was not so great; like when the family was walking with the Watchers or when they started gathering the animals. Speaking of the Watchers, when they were first introduced I started laughing a little, but then I realized, how the heck was Noah (Russell Crowe) ever going to get that big boat built? Then, ta dah, along comes giant rock people. I was glad that the film did keep some elements of the bible, but they sure spruced things up. Most of that sprucing up came by way of Ham (Logan Lerman). By the middle of the film he was really starting to get on my nerves. I guess every family has a rebel. The introduction of Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) also provided some variety. Needless to say he was a bad seed and was determined to survive the destruction of the people of the earth. He also couldn't understand why God didn't want to talk to him. I was like duh.. You're the descendant of the first murderer in human history. Anyway, I didn't really think that this movie was all that great, although the acting was outstanding. The emotional scenes between Noah and Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and Noah and Ila (Emma Watson), really managed to pull at the old heart strings. This film does take a bazaar turn and I found myself thinking ""what the hell is wrong with him?"" He completely turned into a total maniac. If you want to know who I'm talking about, you'll just have to see the film, but it may not be who you think. I initially didn't want to go and see this film because I assumed that I would be bored waiting on the rain to come (much like in Titanic, when I waited on the iceberg). It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped either. I say if you don't have anything else to do, check it out. I give this film an amber light.",Noah
219,donb-519-335075,Incredibly bad!!!!!,1,9 August 2014,"I'm not sure where to start. First - I'll blame my wife - she wanted to see it, so I take no blame for wasting about 100 minutes of the precious life that God has granted me. (Dear Lord, please forgive me I will never squander my time again.) Thankfully I awoke from my stupor long enough to shut this piece of feces off after about 100 minutes of the film. (it is over 2 hours long)I heard that the Director Darren Aronofsky wanted to make this the ""least scripturally accurate"" movie possible. Unfortunately he did not even get that right. He called the main character Noah and his sons Shem and Ham and Japheth. Too bad - he should have called Russell Crowe's character Little Sammy - and his sons Larry, Curly and Moe. Using the actual Biblical names just seems wrong to me.And really they should have built a hover craft or something other than an ark - too close to scripture for me.But what a brilliant idea getting Transformer-like Rock men (provided by God of course) to help build the Ark. This was akin to bringing the HULk into an episode of the Waltons - (did not exactly fit).They even butched up the scenes of the animals coming into the ark - with the exception of the snakes - which were cool - the HIGHLIGHT of the entire movie (all 15 seconds of it.) Unfortunately all the animals went to sleep immediately (some secret herb that Noah or somebody concocted) too bad because steaming piles of manure would have fit this movie perfectly.But the worst was yet to come. Once the earth is flooded, then the dialogue and plot have to carry the story - and the plot line was next to incomprehensible. Who was going to mate with whom? What was the crazy leader of the bad guys doing on the Ark? Why was Ham helping him? I have no clue to any of this - of course by this time, I was just trying to get out of my chair so I could get on Wikipedia and study up on Physics - my most hated subject in school.BUt there is one redeeming element to this movie: I now have an ""iron-clad"" way to evaluate whether I want to see a movie or not. If ANTHONY HOPKINS is in the movie, STAY AWAY. He was incredibly bad in Thor and equally horrible in this stinker. Maybe in a Walter White-like move, Anthony is worried about his family's future and he will take any movie that gets him a buck - my advise would be try making crystal meth instead. Well by this time I guess you can see that I was not fond of this movie. My ranking of the last 3 stinkers I have seen are; #3: Thor #2 3 Days to Kill and you guessed it #1 stinker - Noah. How anyone could rate this a 6 is more mysterious than how they pyramids were built.",Noah
220,evan_harvey,"Not great, but interesting",7,3 April 2014,"**spoilers** This movie is not a faithful adaption of the Biblical story. The Biblical story doesn't have giant stone creatures, or Tubal-Cain hitching a ride on the ark. However, it was still interesting.I won't relate the whole story, since everyone knows it (pretty much), but the parts I found interesting where:The cinematography and settings are very post-apocalyptic. Lots of barren wastelands etc. There are some great visual scenes as well, such as the blood at Noah's feet; the people drowning on the rock etc.Noah uses glowing rocks in the ark, which was interesting since there are Jewish traditions that Noah had glowing rocks that he used for light. The same goes with the magic snake skin, although the traditions are that it was the actual coat of skins God made for Adam that was passed down (eventually to Joseph and his ""many coloured coat""). On a technical note, Noah wouldn't have passed whatever it was to the infant girls, as the rights of the priesthood was patriarchal ie: it went from Noah to Shem down the male line.The idea that Noah believed that all humans were supposed to die was interesting, as it seems reasonable he's think that, and I like that the script delved into Noah's human side. But this leads me to my main criticism of the film:God is nowhere to be seen. The Bible presents a very personal God (even in the Old Testament), but despite only ever referring to him as ""the Creator"", God is always silent, and just watches as Noah flails about with limited direction. In reality, Noah wouldn't ever have almost killed babies.This idea of an impersonal God is both understandable and infuriating. In a story like Noah, the whole premise is built on God telling Noah what he wants, but to then make God this silent almost passive observer is tiring, and unnecessary. The Old Testament is filled with detailed interactions between man and God, so why choose to deliberately ignore them (unless Aronofsky was trying to make an anti-Christian film). It's a shame, because he goes to great lengths to portray the people of earth as wicked and nasty (which was why God destroyed them).Overall, it was pretty good.",Noah
221,jb07-660-944395,Flushed away,1,5 April 2015,"Ten minutes. That's how long I could stand watching it for. The opening scenes with a fake looking snake head appearing (maybe it stuck out in 3D?) looked extremely cheap, nasty and unreal. Then it started off like the old Bible epics of past with text telling us about the beginning. But even though it supposedly is a Bible epic (let me declare my agnosticism now), with a Biblical title and a Biblical text, it immediately deviates into fantasy, talking about a race of evil Angels and industrial cities? This makes Jacksons rabid rewriting of the Hobbit pale into insignificance. We are then introduced to Russell Crowes character teaching the children to respect the life of plants as he then becomes a martial artist and deftly disposes of four hunters. It was about then I checked the time remaining, and being just under 3 hours, I could take no more. This is truly an epic, an epic fail.",Noah
222,s_campanale,Lord of the Arks? - Not a complete Washout (Ha!) nor canonical - Fantasy spectacle that still respects the story despite the touches of Tolkein.,7,4 April 2014,"Let's face it, when Darren Aronofsky said he was making a big budget version of the story of Noah, nobody was expecting Cecile B. DeMille, Charlton Heston and Miklos Roszaor where they? Seems reading some of the pages here that an awful lot of people were hoping for a traditional, faithful old school Biblical epic, hence their disappointment. Well a lot more than disappointment actually, especially for those followers of the Abrahamic faiths who with some justification are furious at having one of their most important stories turned into a sci-fi fantasy epic. But is it really the nakedly political green agenda Atheist propaganda piece everyone here is decrying? I have to say that while there are 'environmental' ideas pushed in here and there, they are hardly ever at the forefront, and though not Biblical canon there is no way this can be called an Atheist movie, even if the man making it is 'non committed'. (He claims repeatedly to be an Atheist but there has always been a very Malick-esque spiritual strain running through his works that defy this assertion. I'm convinced many of the anti-God' people out there are actually believers but dare not say so in public for fear of ridicule from their 'trendy' friends)The most interesting thing about it is that the film takes an unapologetically Sci-fi-Fantasy route, setting the story in some weird undisclosed era that might be the past or the future (though it is only a few thousand years after the expulsion from Eden so maybe not?) The Cain family, purveyors of murder and lustful living, have set up an 'industrial society' that covers the world. Al Gore alert rings immediately, but it is never mentioned again so it might just be something sneaked in. The world however is utterly frakked and in a post-Apocalyptic state. Noah and his family are the last guardians of nature, protecting God's natural creations from man (it's like a job and he treats it as such here) rather like Native Americans in some other movies might. Then Noah gets a vision from 'the Creator' (Useful for talking about God without getting denominational) which a handy visit to grandfather Methuselah, former super warrior and now Shaman, is interpreted as the historic mission to save the animals in the Ark. This Ark looks like a Borg Oblong rather than a ship, and is constructed by 'The Watchers', Angels who came to help Man out but got caught in rock and now look like stone Transformers! But he is getting grief from the King, Tubal Cain who was also the man who murdered his father before his eyes when he was but a boy! (Boo!-Hiss!) He sets up a camp specialising in debauchery, cannibalism and other vices while preparing his army of black clad henchman (These clichés are literally prehistoric!) to attack. Son Ham finds a wife but she gets run over (?) while Sham gets to impregnate adopted sister Ila after some Methuselah magic heals her ruptured womb. As the flood begins a great battle takes place between Cain's army and The Watchers in which they get released from their rock shells and 'ascend' like the Gargoyles from 'I Frankenstein' (Actually, are they related? Could be) while humanity is wiped out. Noah however is convinced that all mankind must be die, including himself, to save creation (is he a Cylon?) and when Ila announces she is pregnant he handily promises to kill the child if it is a child bearing daughter! To make matters worse Tubal Cain sneaked on board and is corrupting wife- less Ham to 'The Dark Side'. Things turn out nice in the end but not before lots of shouting, crying, overacting and an extended fight to the death between Noah and Cain!No, not what you learnt in Sunday school! However, with traditional faith suffering a crisis of faith, updating these timeless mythologies in a more commercial way would be a savvy move, far more effective than simply angrily shouting dogma over and over implacably at people who couldn't care less. C.S Lewis made great advances for Christian theology via this route, and though not denominational ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" have led to a far greater interest in the spiritual and the numinous among a young urban population who otherwise would never have been seen dead near a church or temple. And what was ""Man of Steel"" if not a DC New Testament?OK, so this Noah is a conflicted, fallible human being prone to hubris and rage instead of an all-wise unblemished bastion of virtue, but in our world that line no longer sells either. We want our heroes troubled and human, like us, and that includes Biblical ones too. Personally I've always preferred the 'humanistic' approach to religious icons, sharing their pain and sacrifice and torment, something the Greeks specialised in but which largely vanished with Christianity and Islam. He is the Noah we need in 2014. Acting wise, Crowe does a good job, evoking the similarly Godly Kal-El in 'MOS.' Jennifer Connelly gives us a strong and determined Naameh, no mere passenger she! Emma Watson is OK as Ila, but she is probably only it for the Hermione factor. Anthony Hopkins plays Methuselah as Anthony Hopkins, so no change from there. Best casting stroke though is Ray Winstone as Cain. Raising an instant smile from British viewers, the Cockney hard man evokes both violence and brutality, yet also finds the dignity and pride in a character whose main drive is his belief in the natural superiority of man and his dominion over the world.Destined to be more famous for the controversy than the film, it is an interesting and exciting piece which dares to bring out the Blockbuster in the Bible, though the son of Noah is not the only Ham in it (nor Cheese) I suspect God ultimately approves, but that might just be a hunch..",Noah

So everyone hating on it because they didn't know that there was a thing called ""Djin"" aka the original fallen angels who became monstrous and hateful over time simply never read anything outside of the mainstream. People who think it should follow the king james biblical version of the bible are ignorant of what science fiction-fantasy is all about. I'm not hating on christianity, but this movie was not based on the ideas of mainstream christianity.It's a very excellent movie. But only for people who enjoy stories. STORIES.

224,StonedMagician,Very Good: 8.5,8,29 July 2019,"It seems like movies based on events described in either the Old or New Testaments are a mixed bag. On one hand, they're stories that everyone has at least some idea about, so the built-in audience is fairly high. But on the other, more often than not, they tend to treat their subject matter as a way to preach to the audience. Thankfully, Noah does not preach, but chooses merely to tell the story, which is ironically the film's biggest flaw. We all know how this tale begins and ends, as well as a good deal of what's in between. So even though the events that aren't depicted in the source material serve to make the world seem that much more real, they also feel relatively inconsequential in comparison to the whole. And as a result of all this, the runtime feels slightly excessive. But the visuals are stunning and the performances are strong, and in some ways, that's enough.",Noah

Folks, I know what you're thinking: sounds like it's so bad it's good. Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but this one is so bad it's REALLY bad. In fact, I would call it unwatchable.

226,daviddaphneredding,disappointing and in bad taste,2,9 April 2014,"I usually like stories that ""bring to life"" the Bible, such as ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"", but I cannot honestly say I liked this movie. Were there the Transformer-like Guardians in Noah's day? I never found that in my Bible. To state in another way, it was about as Biblical as ""Transformers"" itself. To deviate from the Scripture as far as they did was, to say the least, in terribly bad taste. I was anxious to see it, but now that I have, to some extent I wish I hadn't. In all fairness, however, I will have to say that the flood was authentic enough, the ark was authentic, the adept Russell Crowe was good in the title role, Jennifer Connolly was good as his wife (just as they were in ""A Beautiful Mind""), but there was no place, nor justification for, the science fiction elements in this movie. I could not recommend this movie, nor its director Darren Aronofsky, since it was a terrible misrepresentation of the Biblical account. Disgusting!",Noah
227,uncsbuddy91,Ruined,2,3 December 2017,"I'm not sure where to begin, this movie went so wrong in so many ways. 1) If you're going to quote the Bible, then actually quote it. Otherwise you're going to turn off the core audience. 2) Why the need for the fallen warriors? 3) Why would they leave Logan's partner? The point of saving Noah's family is so they could repopulate the earth after the flood. 3) Why would Noah think he's supposed to kill the twins? Again, this contradicts the plot. 4) What purpose does Cain serve by being in the story? He would have to be over 2000 years old, and no one in history has ever lived that long. Not to mention that eating the animals in the ark would cause those animals to go extinct, which negates their purpose on the ark in the first place. 5) Logan's character leaves them to find his place on a planet that has just been flooded. There will be no one for him, so he'll die alone, and the earth will be less people to repopulate it. Why have him on the ark in the first place? They completely messed up this story. The only positive review I give is for the special effects. Everything else is completely illogical, especially given that it's based on one of the most important Bible stories.",Noah
228,CelluloidDog,Adventure/SciFi Unbiblical Explores Ethics and Will,6,21 April 2015,"As Darren Aronofsky himself said, it's the least biblical movie. Noah removes itself from strong religious tradition but explores spirituality, ethics and will of man far more than most biblical movies. It takes creative liberty to retell and disguise the old bible story into a transformers/medieval film. Noah (Russell Crowe) and his environmentalist family grew up as vegans and avoid the wickedness of Cain's descendants led by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone). Visions of the Creator are vague and its amazing how Noah interprets them with so little information. But he is determined to build the ark.It was refreshing to see how Noah builds the Ark from a barren land, how he gets help from the Watchers (half angels, half transformers) and how animals converge on the Ark. Special effects and cinematography were quite good (of course, for a $100 million, it should be) but costumes were quite disappointing considering the budget of this film. When Tubal-cain forges a weapon wearing an ancient welders mask, it was a bit too far. Is this the Iron Age? Space Age? Wood Age? Rock Age? It was an interesting well-thought script, above average with irony, ""you are now a man"". I'm not sure if people pick up on the subtleties, but rather face value. So my main contention is costumes. It made the film appear low-budget. And very very little on the animals in the ark. They play a passive role. So little done with special effects, which were fine but sparing on the animals when it could be been better done. We get tiny ant-like elephants and tigers crawling into the Ark. The moment and effects were lacking.Otherwise, the strengths of the film were the writing and acting. Writing had meaning: questioning evil and strength of will. Acting was exceptional by Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. Russell Crowe and Ray Winstone were very good. The sons of Noah were average. It's really a fairly good epic that brings up many questions. It breaks down Noah, a pillar of strength in the family and chosen for this mission. The age-old question of doubt of faith is a common theme that is stronger in this adaptation than most other ancient tales. Few reviewers pick up on this but its a great discussion. When does faith break down and doubt replaces? At what point does one differentiate from a steadfast task without breaking, without mercy?My final rating for this epic is a 6.7; it would break a 7.0 if the costumes and attention to animals (had chances to use those effects) which would work better than stony transformers. Nevertheless, a well-acted, thoughtful film that most people will criticize without thought. How ironic. However, it's strong sense won't appeal to people who like fuzzy cuddly movies. It's not a feel-good movie but a relief from a long journey.",Noah

Forget about being a true adaptation to the account in Genesis, but even being a viable film sustaining itself and just being decent. There are so many missed opportunities, wrong roads traveled, plot holes, weird plot devices, etc. Arnofsky is a strange guy. If you've seen ""Black Swan"", or ""The Fountain"" you know he is no stranger to trippy adventures with his own style and dynamic. I personally am not a fan of this style. At one point he was attached to ""The Wolverine"" sequel, and luckily he didn't stay attached because I feel that would have been a blow Marvel may not have recovered from unless they maintained enough production control. The producers kept their hands in this movie as well which is why you can at least recognize the story and maybe they are to blame for the lameness or weird decisions. Crowe salvaged this for me from being a complete and utter disaster. The end result is justpathetic.",Noah
230,JohnnyPHreak,The world gets a reboot. We get an emotionally driven fantasy.,7,15 July 2014,"I'm not religious. I was when I was young. My parents would take me to church every Sunday and sometimes in the middle of the week. It was when I got to high school I stopped going. I was a bit of a rebel, still am. But I've taken religious class and I know a little about many of the different religions of the world. I'm far from an expert but I get the gist. I won't shout my opinion on religion and God because that's not what I'm here for. I'm hear to tell you about one of my favorite directors, Darren Aronofsky biblical fantasy Noah.Now with making a biblical fantasy epic for a major studio there are going to be issues. And Mr. Aronofsky isn't the type of director that you can just hone in. I was wary that him making such a huge film for such a big studio. He's the type of the director that would want final cut with his vision. And there were news reports that he had to cut it significantly and that he was in a fight with the studio. I would love to see a director's cut of this film because this theatrical cut thrilled me.I wasn't sure what I was going to think after seeing it. But Aronofsky has created a fantasy driven film about a bible story that I can get right behind. The story comes directly from the King James Bible story which is about three pages long (I goggled it). It follows Noah, a family man who is tasked with the idea to help ""The Creator"" (they never say God in the film) reboot the world. He followed by his loving wife, three sons and their adopted daughter.What follows is Aronofsky interpretation of the story which engrosses, engages the audiences and really makes you think about not just religion but life itself. The film is more about a man trying to protect his family in the midst of a life alter experience. Russell Crowe is killer as he always is. With this and Man of Steel I think the man is back as the talent actor many of us use to love. I can't see anyone taking this with the emotion he does. He has an evolution that would send any to the brink of madness with Crowe making you love/hate/feel for him. I don't think he'll be up for any awards but he should be.Jennifer Connelly plays his wife and she's a great balance to Crowe's Noah. She loving, faithful to a point but will do anything for her family. I miss seeing her on screen. Ray Winstone is just vicious, making for a gritty ""villain"" of the film. He does elude a charisma that in the film would make you want to follow him into battle. Logan Lerman pulls of the angst rebellious teenager well. With Emma Watson sporting well against the heavy hitters of the film.Because this is an Aronofsky film, it feels much different than most biblical epics. I am extremely pleased with the way he shows off this world. It feels very fantastical in the Lord of the Rings way. I like that because I'm a person who has read these stories and think of them in a more as fantasy. The visual are great, but at time might take many people out of the film if they can't suspend their disbelief or beliefs.It's not going to please everyone. I know a certain religious sect that is up in arms about how they are portrayed. But for a fantasy film about a bible story, this film entertains from start to finish. Aronofsky proves he's one of the best directors working now. I would just enjoy seeing a director's cut to see is true vision and his thought process. See it just for the visual aspect but the story will engross with excellent performances from Crowe and Connelly.",Noah
231,sohansurag,Quasi-Biblical Fantasy Drama,7,19 April 2014,"There are some movies that sticks with you for a long long time, twisting and turning your perspectives of the real life, even resorting to them for the unanswered questions life throws at you. For now, two movies adheres to me, David Fincher's Fight Club and Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Two of the most influential and inspiring movies of our times, panned by the critics upon release and shot to cultdom post home- video release. Of the lot Fight Club would appeal to a more casual audience, thanks to Brad Pitt's chiseled looks and its rebellious narrative, Fight Club does wonders to a semi-insurgent. But The Fountain is a whole different ball game. I wouldn't call it an easy watch and definitely not Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece, its glimmer only appeals to the ones that truly seek them.From a Director who has constantly bestowed upon us, a slew of AAA movies like Pi, Requiem For a Dream, The Fountain, The Wrestler and the Black Swan comes Noah. For Aronofsky newbies, Noah could be considered to be one of his most accessible movies. Then again as it revolves around the Genesis of Noah's Ark and The Great Flood, it might prove to be more offensive to them than his unconventional offish movies. Its not exactly a retelling of the Biblical Noah that we are all familiar with. Instead he has taken his creative freedom and inspiration in taking characters from Bible. So a bearded saint like Noah that you'd pictured is a brawny badass here, remorselessly killing anybody who comes in his way, the path he himself interprets from signs, he believes are, from The Creator. As obvious as it is, it is a sensitive topic and would undoubtedly hurt a lot. But take note here, Noah is not in any ways a religious movie and to consider it just as a fantasy movie inspired from characters from barely 3 pages of the Bible would be wise. Blending magic and myth ain't new in Hollywood.Aronofsky definitely steps out of his comfort zone here, and that's exactly why it feels lazy. While his previous movies had original characters, Noah borrows and beefs up characters from the Bible and its bound to be true to its roots at least a bit. Creative freedom cannot do so much change as to rewrite a Biblical persona. So, yes this also becomes Aronofsky's weakest movies in terms of narrative. But being weak doesn't mean its not entertaining, it makes for a brilliant fantasy movie with enough drama and action. Its often people's obstinance to overlook that these are Biblical and holy that makes it look dull. Consider it a plain Disaster movie or Fantasy and it fits perfectly the niche. Not the best, but entertaining nonetheless.Russel Crowe plays the titular Noah and he's as badass as any Biblical figure can get. He breaks the usual stereotypes of bearded, calm figures and becomes a true badass and a force to reckon with. He also convincingly portrays the vulnerabilities of a mere mortal who is self- assigned to protect mankind along with all the creatures, albeit dealing with his own family's well being. Jennifer Connelly playing Noah's wife Naameh, doesn't get to shine until the second act and I'd say she was well cast. Emma Watson plays Ila, a character written extensively for the movie and does justice to her role but wasn't that a bit too much screen time for her? Ray Winstone as Tubal-cain was sheer intimidating, an adversary truly worthy of mention despite his petty screen time and the way he manipulates Noah's son, sheer evil. Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Methuselah, Noah's grandfather who displays a good performance winning over the short time he's allotted to. The cast also includes Logan Lerman as Ham and Douglas Booth as Shem who were meh.It wouldn't be an Aronofsky movie if not for his style and visuals. While the CG animals and Ark was passable, it was some of the time lapse shots that truly had me dumbfound. This particular sequence which followed evolution also had me in awe. There were of course the Guardians that resembled Golems that made for a pleasant fantasy addition as well. Noah is definitely dark and considering how its source material had its own dark shades at times, it is only justifiable. Clint Mansell's composition, although not as striking as Requiem or Fountain, does have its edge. Performed by Kronos Quartet, while some tracks were truly haunting, many a times I noticed that it shared a string or two with The Fountain's score.Noah is by no means, Aronofsky's best. But for what its worth, he's made a compelling quasi-fantasy drama with source material barely spanning 3 chapters. I wouldn't call it Biblical or the least bit religious and I find no reason to detest anything I have seen. Its not because I am analogically neutral; In what I saw, among its flaws I was able to find the best and I loved it. Still want to talk faith? Aeons from now, I wouldn't be surprised if Durdenism becomes a valid religion with its own testaments, idols and whatnot neither will I be surprised if my own kin are devotees.",Noah
232,Ana_Banana,Self-hatred to the masses,1,18 December 2014,"A historical movie (supposing this one fits in that category) should not necessarily be entirely accurate, especially when the facts were controversial or not very clearly documented. But to twist the story against its initial significance is more than reinterpretation. 'Noah' is not about the ancient moralizing tale, it's about the present. The first visual impact of this movie was that the characters looked almost like contemporary people, with their hairstyles and clothes totally unfit to that time and place and with their bazookas and flares. Then, in this 'Biblical' film, God is absent and not named as such, it's all about 'the Creator' (why not naming him as such if it were really about God?). Good and evil are confused, the planet and the animals are innocent, and the humans are evil and have to be exterminated through 'cleansing' and birth control. The source and amount of this evil are not discussed, but only a chosen bloodline (Noah's family) is picked up as founder of a new world (inbreeding doesn't seem to be a problem for this elite family). This contemporary, extreme environmentalist agenda is pushed so ridiculously in your face that it was too obvious and made you feel sorry for the lack of subtlety of those people who have spent a 'big budget' to produce and promote this movie. But here is the first big flaw: if animals were that innocent, why drown the species not represented on the Ark? Say, the dinosaurs or the trilobites were wicked and the centipedes were pure at heart? The movie tells us nothing real about its main motivation: why is man evil, why is the Flood necessary, why is Noah's family better than others and which is the way to salvation, if any. Actually, Noah behaves like a misanthropic creep with the hushed voice of a schizophrenic, who hates everybody and tries to kill or refuses to save anyone who is not his family (even his son's girlfriend, who was said to be pure and innocent, so it's not important to be good, but to be family). While on the Ark, when almost all the people on Earth die around him, he acts in the same subdued, robotic way (and his family does that, too). Now what is this chosen bloodline anyway (chosen by 'the Creator', of course)? Within Noah's family, birthright is represented by the skin of the snake in the Garden of Eden. Does anybody remember who that snake was in the Bible? Then who are these people, with their magical snake skins made apparent during their 'initiation', are they reptiles or what? Oh wait, the snake in Eden was a symbol for Satan, now we are relieved, aren't we? Then, who is 'the Creator' actually? Apparently the movie has a happy end concocted to please the superficial common sense and not to shock too hard: the mercy towards Noah's granddaughters, children, rainbows, blah blah. How about the other countless humans, who were drowned in the Flood or killed by Noah? And how about their newly born granddaughters, were they not as pure as Noah's? Oh, they haven't received the snake skin transmission, right? No, sir, we are not all guilty for destroying the environment and for other crimes, only the greedy and the criminals are, but there are laws for that, there's no need to kill everybody but a 'special' family. I won't deal with the other fabrications and mixed messages in this film, such as the gnostic Tubal-Cain and the ridiculous stone giants turned into good guys. In a word, the message of this movie is absurd and not justified ('the Creator' created humanity to destroy it and then chose for no reason a psychopath and his 'snake' family as the only survivors to please him better). The acting is so bad that it's sometimes annoying, the CGI special effects look artificial, the script is ridiculously bad (see above), and the directing is pretentious but bland. Except all these, it's an excellent film. For the animals, of course.",Noah
233,borismk-38942,Vegetarians use the Bible to make a propaganda film,1,21 January 2019,"This film raises a lot of questions, none of them worth taking the time to answer. Like, if God hates meat eaters so much then why did he deliberately create carnivores? How is the human race going to repopulate itself with a genepool of just Emma Watson? If meat eating is so evil why am I now comfortably eating a burger without being struck by lightning? Was Russel Crowe actively being sponsored by vegan food producers, and if so, just how much did they give him to promote human genocide onscreen? This is the bible story that nobody wanted to see, why not go with a lesser known story? Where's the movie about Samson fighting the Phillistines with nothing but a jawbone? Classic action story, no preachy vegan overtones",Noah

It's a story about a man cooped up in an claustrophobic environment (an ark, not a hotel) that goes bonkers and wants to murder people just like Jack Nicholson (The Shining). Its a story about an impending world disaster and an a gigantic floating vessel is built to save mankind(2012).The biggest and most contrasting element of this film that differs from the bible is the theme that Russell Crowe's Noah believes all of Mankind is bad rather than the Bible's concept that there were bad men. Noah, in this version, wants to extinguish the entire human race. The Bible's Noah believes in mankind.",Noah
235,stephenlovelette,The Difference Between Fantasy and Scripture,10,9 July 2014,"Aronofsky openly dissociates Noah as a Biblical film. Case in point: The word 'God' is not used to describe the deity. Rather it's referred to as 'The Creator.'In Noah, the book of Genesis is used as a jumping off point in retelling the cataclysm.Animated cutaways make up a small but crucial part of this. By intertwining time lapses with CGI, visual depictions of the big bang theory and evolution are overlaid with Noah's voice-over, narrating the Biblical creation narrative.The time lapses are just dynamite.Speaking of creation narratives, how about a complete life cycle barely longer than a blink? In one take a first person camera angle follows the plummet of a raindrop from mid-cloud formation to impact upon Noah's upraised cheek.Russell Crowe is fantastic as Noah.Perhaps the strongest acting is performed by Emma Watson as Il-la. She's simply excellent, and even gets the waterworks going towards the end.High stakes for PG-13, huh?The ending's excellent. Satisfactory at the very least.Another upside to Noah is the portrayal of side effects from an abnormal flood: The surrounding sound of people dying as the ark weathers the storm, the use of incense to make the animals go to sleep, the debatable decision to allow snakes on-board, etc.Here's one of the finest nuances. As the portrait of the saintly hero, the perfect man within The Creator's gaze, Noah's time is devoted accordingly. Even in the moment the audience catches him at ease, he's chiseling the miniature hull of a model boat; a microcosm of his occupation. Noah's chosen hobby reflects the most proficient structuring of a lifestyle.A quick aside regarding 'zohar,' a mineral resembling sparkly gold walnuts. It's an intriguing plot element and incredibly original. It represents a source of combustion, a means of commerce, a cause for societal conflict and a luminous beacon of energy, power and divine mystery. It's an excellent mythological creation, because as an ancient element depleted before recorded history, its theoretical existence is more palatable. Perhaps the film could be two minutes shorter. Instead of gushing endlessly, I perused a trio of thumbs-downers to see where others (Reviewers 1, 2 and 3) find rot in the tomato. If you haven't seen Noah, cease reading and bask in its glory at your nearest leisure.(I'm kidding and welcome feedback. Particularly if it's spell-checked.)First, the minor criticisms. These are primarily concerns with 'the watchers', the supposedly overbearing ecological rhetoric, the imperfect CGI, Noah's depiction (and/or Russell Crowe's performance), or any perception of plot distance (be it too similar, or too different) from the Biblical narrative.These are conceivable convictions, but to qualify any one of them as a 'major detractor' from the overall film becomes a stretch. Such criticisms make me suspicious of the agenda behind the keystrokes.The 'Nephilim' ('the watchers') are a race of fallen angels, reinterpreted in Aronofsky's film as giant stone golems.Continuing the earlier list 'zohar' is reminiscent of their biological life force. The gilded glow's the cementuous paste, and combined with their aggregate exoskeletons, produces concrete titans.Reviewer #3 claims 'the watchers', ""look like Stone Giants in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" This is an utter injustice to Noah. There is no comparison to be made between the two films other than an abundance of beautiful settings and scenery. THAUJ is a terrible movie with a horrifically bad scene involving boxing mountains and unharmed dwarfs.Needless to say, 'the watchers' are a lot of fun. But they exemplify a larger issue: Just because a movie is epic, with vast settings and a CGI-assisted battle doesn't make it unoriginal. The connections drawn between Noah and LOTR are prolific.My feeling is that we, as the viewers, can't think like this. It's unproductive because the two movies are set in completely different universes, let alone narrative contexts. One's a series of fantasy novels, the other's religious scripture. Just because the physical surroundings resemble each other (at times, they're at sea for half the movie) doesn't mean it's a weakness in the film.#1 asserts the film's worst attribute to, ""The concept of faith is a non-issuenotions of fate vs. free-will go out the window when your Creator is choosing whether you live or die based on which son of Adam you descended from."" This teeters on nonsense and seems like a resolution to unfilled space.The Chief Editor of the Internet should take this review down, because one couldn't possibly believe that faith, fate and freewill are non-issues. Sure it's colloquially known that Noah lives. But any character can undergo a tragedy at any moment.The entire dag-nabbed movie is about the good and bad of faith, fate and freewill. The underlying tension stems from our certainty in the wrongness of Noah's intended actions, and its inevitable necessity.#1 finishes with the claim, ""Aronofsky affords neither God nor man much dimension, and many viewers may find themselves sympathizing more with the teeming leagues of humanity.""The audience does indeed feel torn between the two opposing forces. But that's a generally accepted mainstay of 'good writing.' If #1 finds himself siding with 'humanity' it's because Aronofsky does a great job of skewing the border between good and evil. This isn't a tired or easily scribbled cliché.Finally, #3 relays a potential theory in which the, ""character of Noah is being used as a commentary on modern-day religious zealots who believe they have a monopoly on 'the truth.'"" This is indeed a relevant topic in current religious study and a nuance I didn't recognize.Aronofsky's depiction of angels ascending to heaven is an excellent visual, animated with an incredible level of realism. I've been picturing it this way since 'before I can remember.'",Noah
236,Maladjusted_1,"One of history's most legendary stories is turned into a cheap, superficial fantasy action.",3,25 June 2015,"When you consider that the Bible is one of the most widely read books of all time, and how the story of Noah is one of the most recognisable within it, you may approach Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah' with a myriad of expectations. My advice: don't. This film begins with an interesting and well-shot opening sequence, but the second sequence (i.e. ""boy sees father being killed by dangerous men"") has been done to death in cinema, and so by the five minute mark I had already lowered my opinion of the film. I was again disappointed when I discovered that in the world of Aronofsky, Russell Crowe's Noah was a formidable martial artist. ""Oh, it's going to be one of 'those' films,"" I thought. My next episode of perplexity came when I remembered that there were no stone golems in the Book of Genesis. My first thought was that the producers must have confused their Scripture with their Tolkien, but I later read that gnostic writings were called upon in the construction of this narrative. My frustration with this film was slightly relieved when I saw that Anthony Hopkins had graced the set; unfortunately, his role isn't too exciting, and I was back to being disappointed in no time. The film's villain makes an appearance relatively early, in the form of Tubal-cain, played by the easily thuggish Ray Winstone. There was no biblical depth to this character, or to his army of flat, characterless followers; I'd go so far as to say that these characters were wholly unnecessary. By far the largest disappointments in 'Noah' came in the depiction of the animals, and in the reliving of the flood. I had some 'Life of Pi'-esque expectations, anticipating the animals desperately grasping onto the vessel, engaging in skirmishes, etc., but there was none of this. Viewers are ""treated"" to one unrewarding scene in which thousands of CGI creatures convene on the Ark, but they're seldom seen again. The filmmakers also fail to convey what was, for followers of the Bible, the first disaster event. In fact, the flooding is as ambiguous as the animals. I was surprised that the quite remarkable editing and cinematography involved in the film's several narrative scenes could not be applied to the most integral parts of the story of Noah. There are a few redeeming qualities, such as Emma Watson's strong performance and the aforesaid editing, but it is largely a catastrophe. The lore of both the gnostic writers and Aronofsky are employed in the telling of the story, but are never explained, and we are left with what I consider ""filler"", similar to Peter Jackson's input in 'The Hobbit' but with a weaker framework. I am disappointed by the lack of a human element in the film. There is one predictable scene in which Noah decides against doing something abhorrent and defies God's word, but the possibilities to explore intelligent dialogues (e.g. ""can man decide who is to be saved?""; ""what are the ramifications of 'playing God'?""; ""is He a vengeful God?"") are foregone, and Aronofsky favours a superficial action- fantasy, imbued with Greenpeace rhetoric, wholly devoid of the greatness that constituted biblical epics such as 'The Ten Commandments'.",Noah
237,gokselcin,Good movie but not as Aronofsky's any movie.,8,25 July 2019,"Visual narration, cinematography are really perfect.

238,infessted,Horrible directing and editing,5,8 July 2020,"All the copious time-lapse filming and horrendous editing, coupled with the fact that they scored the best music during the building of the ark stupid decision and one of the reasons why this movie tanked at the box office. They didn't even show the ark hitting land! That alone could have been an epic scene where they emerge from the darkness to the light- with the sky opening up to a beautiful sunlight-such a failure for a potentially great movie. The director shouldn't make movies anymore imo since he has no idea how to structure scenes to evoke emotion at the right times. What a disappointment.

239,pintaxandre,Probably one of the most controversial blockbusters of the 2010's,7,10 April 2020,"This is a daring but flawed film of Aronofsky. Visually it is splendid. CGI is well handled except for the effects on Anthony Hopkins, they look ridiculous. There is a mix of good and bad acting. Some characters are not developed at all, others yes, but I must say I am truly admirative of Noah's character development. It is such an icon that I did not even think the writers would dare to write him a real ark (no pun intended), but they did. It is for me one of the strong aspects of the movie.
Otherwise, a villain with great line, but not developped. Some problems in the narrations. The intro is too rushed and the ""story scene"" that comes later in the scene should have been used at the beginning. A lot of plot holes and things left unexplained. It is not because you make a movie about a godly intervention that it is tolerable to use this excuse as a deus ex machina everytime it helps the plot to go further. The story however is good and I liked the originality with the stone giants. By far not a good movie, but an interesting one without a doubt.",Noah

241,rushknight,An incredibly difficult endeavor for a writer,3,12 August 2014,"At the time of writing of this review, there are 981 reviews already written about this film.In my estimation, that makes it perfectly safe for me to mouth off and say whatever the hell I want! No one will read it anyway!To begin with, creating any movie about ancient biblical mythology is probably one of the riskiest things a movie maker can do. If the intended audience is not Judeo-Christians, then they will complain that the movie is ""too religious."" If the intended audience IS Judeo-Christian, then they will complain that the movie ""doesn't follow the book."" So right at the beginning things are tough. Personally, I was raised Christian, but even I can see that the story ""as written"" is not movie worthy. There are simply too many unanswered questions about Noah and the Ark. Some exaggeration, extrapolation and re-interpretation is absolutely necessary to move forward. However, there are some downright ""inaccurate"" parts when compared to the ""original."" I'm fairly certain that the bible mentions that Noah and his children boarded the ark ""with their wives."" Yeah. Whatever. It's a movie.In that light, I was delighted to see that the writers really put a lot of thought into Noah's character.. so much thought that they made him seem almost mad. Unfortunately, almost every other character in the movie was undeveloped and ultimately rather pointless. I shouldn't complain, since the movie is called, ""Noah"" after all.As far as the make of the film itself goes, everything was fairly standard, the filming and acting were appropriate so I don't know why people were complaining about it. I don't know how they could have added or subtracted from it, so I will say nothing about it except that it's acceptable acting. The filming was good, the cgi was.. well as good as can be expected.The only thing that really just didn't sit well with me was the character of Noah himself. I felt that his conclusions and actions as a character were somewhat nonsensical. Why did he come to the conclusions he did? Why turn into a raving lunatic? Why try to drown your sorrows in drink when it's clear that the world is once again ready for life? Ultimately the story fails to impress because the character of Noah came off as more of a nutjob than anything else. You didn't find yourself empathizing with him, you found yourself empathizing against him.Three stars for a well filmed, well developed but ultimately nonsensical re-visioning of the biblical story.",Noah
242,villard,Deluge-ional,1,17 August 2014,"This is a uniquely bizarre movie in that I am at a loss to imagine what kind of audience its producers thought the film would appeal to. Neither saint nor sinner can take much away from this fractured fairy tale.It is not for Christians because the film goes out of its way to bastardize the biblical account of Noah's Ark and marginalize God.As a tall tale for the non-devout it is bleak, ponderous, sullen, brooding and just freakin' weird. It is so unredeeming it ranks as one of the absolutely worst movies I have ever suffered through. I just sat there saying, ""this can't get any worse,"" but it does. I imagine a lot of people simply walked out the movie theater midway through this train wreck.The plot derailments:1. The fallen angel rock monsters just leave you scratching your head saying WTF?! They are a huge distraction. They warp the story into some freakish fantasy/sc-fi yarn.2. The bleak, barren landscape behind the action looks like the Great Flood has already come and gone. Where are the people and their cities (we can't even see an orgy in Sodom)? When we do see to shots of the barbarian hordes it look like they are having their own twisted Renaissance Fair in the woods. 3. The politically correct vegetarianism, i.e. man is evil because he killing all animals theme is mawkish. It reminds me of the preachy remake of the ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" where the conclusion is that the world is better off without humans. This is antithetical to the whole Genesis story.4. God is MIA in this movie. There is an odd aversion to putting the name ""God"" into the script. There are several pathetic scenes where Noah stares helplessly into blank clouds looking for a sign from ""The Creator."" This leaves little doubt that the ark patriarch is truly delusional. I would have settled here for a piece of Monty Python animation. 6. CG would have offered tremendous opportunities to show pairs of animals boarding the ark -- the crux of the whole biblical ""Earth reborn"" theme. But we see very little of our forest friends as Noah plays out his schizophrenic struggles on the upper deck. Even more perversely, a bad guy hiding out on the ark starts eating the animals! He is a one-man mass extinction. 7. The ending is totally anticlimactic. Your are left thinking, ""really? I sat through 2-1/2 hour for this?""Artistically, the CG of the ark weathering the deluge is beautifully biblical. Also, the animation of a curious evolutionary version of Genesis is nicely done.",Noah
243,patlightfoot,Terrible,4,2 June 2015,"My adult son rather enjoyed it, but I didn't one bit and kept fast forwarding. Regarding the acting - very ordinary, no drama, a walk in the park for Noah faced with such odds. Was pathetic.Where were the animals? The legend of Noah is known around Turkey and Mount Ararat, as well as in the Jewish bible (old testament) and still celebrated each year eating a Noah's soup. Geologists and archaeologists are convinced that this actually happened when the Black Sea formally separated from the fresh water lake below it by a land bridge and Mediterranean, broke and allowed water to pour through the Dardanelles and around the Pillars of Hercules. Obviously if people (the world to them on low ground would have known) were affected. This happened around 6,000 years ago after the ice began to melt and flooded low lying regions and the sea levels started to reach what they are today. The continent of Europe was separated from Great Britain. PNG and Tasmania from mainland Australia, etc.But really Russell your lay back acting didn't gel with me. Hence the score of 4. Anthony Hopkins playing grandfather? The mind is still boggling.But the special effects credits went on and on. Personally it looked like something from the Trilogy of the ring. Fallen angels? Looked like something out of Transformers. I much preferred other versions like John Houston's The Bible. This was too surreal for me, thanks.",Noah
244,MVictorPjinsiste,Noah Is A Good Movie.,7,2 April 2019,"I liked Noah, because it is a fantasy film with an ecologic message, where the danger of interpreting what ""God"" means is a life and death game, instead of a simple religious absolute.But what I appreciated more, is the creation of a pre-draught, fantasy world, with weird animals and minerals, and a sky so pure one can see the stars in daytime - which probably accounts for these humans' longer lives.Most of all, the photography was superb, rich in contrasts, and Crowes' acting was that of a progressive change. Emma Watson was also particularly touching, as was Jennifer Connally.So, 7/10 for the vision, for the message and for nice performences. Sure, there are some jarring parts (like the Watcher's peculiar looks and animation) and some dark scenes, but all in all that was something quite different.",Noah
245,john32935,Epic drama with unintentional epic humor,4,20 January 2015,"There are 3 moments of unintentional comedy in this epic retelling of the biblical story of Noah (Russell Crowe) and the Great Flood. First, there is the inclusion of the Biblical-era creation of electricity and other machinery by the descendants of Cain. I am no historian, but I am pretty sure that this has no basis in fact for this element. In my opinion, it did not add anything to the story other than the ""lesson"" than man's pollution of the Earth is a bad thing. Second, there is the inclusion of moving and talking, huge stone creatures that are the former angels struck down by the Creator. I am no Biblical scholar, but I am pretty sure there is no Biblical basis for this movie creation either. (I can accept the poetic license used to move the birth of Noah's children from before the Flood (in the movie) rather than after the Flood (in the Bible).)And finally, after seeing Mr. Crowe's universally-panned singing performance in Les Miserables, I had to laugh out loud when Noah's youngest child turns and asks Mr. Crowe to sing him to sleep, which he then does. Apparently, either Mr. Crowe is a glutton for more negative reviews or he was seeking critical redemption by accepting this challenge. Let's just say, his singing still ranks up there with Pierce Brosnan (in Mama Mia) as unintentional worst vocal recordings in film history. Of course, the only thing better (for me) would have been if Mr. Crowe had selected a tune from Les Mis to sing to his son.All of the above having occurred in the first 20 minutes of the film, it was difficult for me to refocus on the movie as a whole. But if I ignore the above, I would say that director Darren Aronofsky's depiction of the Great Flood, the Ark, and the gathering of all creatures are fine examples of film-making including the use of excellent CGI.Mr. Aronofsky also includes a depiction of Noah's fanaticism of following his interpretation of the Creator's intention to destroy all of mankind, including Noah's family, that seemingly has no basis in any prior literature. This story line occupies about one-third of the film in an attempt to provide some drama. If the destruction of the Earth is not enough drama to satisfy your audience, you may need to rethink your movie-making skills. At some point, Mr. Aronofsky needs to learn to limit such poetic licensing.However, since I cannot ignore the three creative hiccups and cannot say that these are justifiable elements of alleged visionary Mr. Aronofsky, I cannot recommend this movie.",Noah
246,sickofenjoyingmyself,Good visuals but lack of depth,6,28 July 2015,"I wasn't really expecting much of this movie having seen the general consensus of reviews but I decided to give it a go for myself. I really enjoyed the visuals of the movie and a lot of the cinematography - I think this is what kept me engaged enough to watch it until the end. Unfortunately there just wasn't enough depth to the movie to make it a memorable experience. Crowe's Noah changed too drastically during the story and it just had too much of an unbelievable quality. I know movies are not always meant to be believable and if the story line is far fetched the quality has to match in order for the viewer to accept the experience. I don't feel that they got it totally right here. The walking, talking rock creatures were totally unnecessary and laughable in hindsight. I wouldn't say that it was a terrible movie. I've given it 6 out of ten for visuals - which are enjoyable, and some of the acting is OK - but I just get the feeling that none of them totally believed in it. One last point - what happened to the humongous cargo of animals on board when they get on the island at the end of the movie? You don't see a single one!",Noah
247,GoUSN,Masterpiece of film-making; gripping in every way,10,29 March 2014,"I have to laugh at those who criticize because this interpretation is not true to the Biblical account. Perhaps I, as a Jesuit-educated Roman Catholic, give film-makers a little more sway when it comes to interpretation.This is grand, old-fashioned film-making. DeMille. Spartacus. The Ten Commandments. It's on that grand of a scale.We are immediately engaged because of the gritty realism (with allowances for this being a Bible-based movie). We then are introduced to Noah in adulthood. We are with him as he morphs from confused to noble to mad, brought eventually to mercy and love. He is a very human depiction of Noah - a common brave man brought by circumstance and birth right to ultimate human glory, with ""human"" meant in all of its respects - from common to sublime to deeply flawed.A masterpiece.",Noah
248,dutchs-1,"Creative, powerful and brilliant",9,30 March 2014,"I have no interest in seeing Son of God, the other big religious film of early 2014, because filmmakers who make movies about the life of Jesus are so intimidated that their films inevitably end up as insipid pap. People rebel against anything that rattles their mental images from Sunday School. If the film shows Jesus saying ""pass the salt"" at the Last Supper, they'll launch a firestorm of protest that those exact words are not in the Bible.The story of Noah, from birth to death, is less than 2400 words long and most of it revolves around the ark. So there's lots of room for invention to fill the gaps. When someone says a film is unbiblical, there are two possible meanings. Either the film directly contradicts something in the Bible, or it injects something that shakes the viewer's mental image. The major problem for most critics is that the film depicts man as being punished for ravaging the earth, something not in the Bible, but hardly inconsistent with it. Two points that have taken heavy ridicule are the rock creatures (who are actually fallen angels who were punished for disobedience by being imprisoned in rock) and the glowing Adam and Eve. The rock creatures are probably meant to be the enigmatic Nephilim, and depicting the unfallen Adam and Eve as glowing is an effective way to show their loss of supernatural powers. One problem is the serpent in the garden looks more like the GEICO gecko than a really malevolent creature.There are some things in the story that directly contradict the Bible, but they've hardly drawn a whisper of protest. Noah's father, Lamech, died when he was 595 years old, not when he was a child. And the Bible explicitly mentions that Noah's sons all had wives on the ark. Also Noah and his family sealed themselves in the ark seven days before the rains began. But then again, there are details in the Ten Commandments that contradict the Bible, too.Noah's grandfather, Methuselah, gives him a seed from Eden. When Noah plants it, a spring bursts forth and rivulets of water flow outward. Vegetation springs up and creatures follow the rejuvenating water to the ark. A forest springs up, providing Noah with a source of wood. The rock creatures do most of the heavy work. The scenes where the birds and beasts enter the ark are wondrous, the snakes and crawling things, well, you have to like snakes. When the rain starts to fall, the evil king Tubal-Cain (a real Biblical character) leads his followers to storm the Ark, and the rock creatures defend it. The battle scene has been called reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, and the redemption of the rock creatures as they are killed is powerful and poetic. Methuselah is rummaging in the moss for berries, which he hasn't had in ages. He finds one, eats it joyously, and is swept off by the flood. The Genesis genealogies actually do add up to Methuselah dying the same year as the Flood, though most commentators pietistically assume he didn't die that way. But there's precisely zero in the Bible to justify that belief. As the rains pour down, we see a zoom out to show the whole earth covered with spiral storm systems.The sequence on the ark is the most problematic and my reason for not giving this a solid ten. There needs to be some dramatic conflict because there are only so many times they can sing ""99 wine-skins of wine on the wall"" while waiting out the flood. Tubal-Cain sneaks aboard the ark; not in the Bible but not specifically denied, either. Ham hates Noah for not helping him save a girl from the Flood, and doesn't rat Tubal-Cain out. Noah concludes his mission was to save innocent creatures and let the human race die out, and when Shem's wife turns up pregnant, he vows to kill the baby if it's a girl. It doesn't seem to occur to him that God could just as easily led all animals to an isolated mountain and drowned all humans, if that's what he wanted. Tubal-Cain makes his move on Noah, but is killed by Ham just as the ark slams into a rock.One scene well done on the ark is Noah recounting the creation story, which is visualized as a strikingly scientifically accurate history of the earth. We see the mega-impact that formed the moon and a highly sped-up depiction of evolution, climaxed by the luminous Adam and Eve in the Garden. Noah's delusion, which makes him a really reprehensible character, is redeemed when he decides he just cannot kill his infant grandchildren. After the Flood abates, we get a good glimpse of why searches for the ark are futile: the ark sits broken in two on a rocky summit, while Noah and his family scavenge timber. Noah gets drunk and falls asleep naked. Ham does nothing, but Shem and Japheth respectfully cover him. Ham wanders off into the new world, though given the story line, it would have been a lot more dramatically satisfying to have him sneer ""serves you right"" at the drunken Noah. The story ends with rainbow colors filling the sky, though not literal rainbows.",Noah

I debated about putting a spoiler tag on this one. How can you possibly spoil something that is already rotten? It beats ""Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes"" or either Sharknado flick. It is jaw-droppingly awful. And those french-fried crispy fireflies known as ""The Watchers"", I believe, took this movie to a whole new level of bad.

250,botrytis,Solid film and admirable perspective,8,29 March 2014,"NoahThe moment when you realize that no matter what you expect from a movie directed by an atheist, in practice you gonna be shocked (both positively and negatively) Of course mostly this happens because of the delicate theme we have here, which is BIBLICAL STORY"" and the adaptation comes from a man who doesn't believe in GOD, yet this still does not mean that he is against the moral lessons that the Bible or another similar religious story tells. The movie itself represents the classic religious references, but all these are connected to each other to build up the kind of moral lesson what the movie tells, but of course all these connections could be found in the book also, yet here these are directly around Noah's ark. However the biblical line is covered with a fantasy-like fable surface (Fable within Fable) which we may find kinda odd, but admirable as the idea to bring the same ol' story in another form, coz' the adaptations in Vatican's liking are already made (for example the 1999 Noah's ark).So the surface is fable-like, the message is though brutally realistic and it may could be considered psycho-thrillerish, how Noah struggles with fanaticism"" to bare the burden to be the one who decides about existence of the whole humanity becomes a brutal dead-end story in which we feel alienated from the Sunday school's happy stories and realize that we have something different here. Don't get me wrong, I'm saying realistic to the philosophy side of this motion picture and the story itself, the existence of humanity and moral-ism is a timeless question which in this movie is perfectly depicted, how Noah's ark becomes another true test from GOD to the people who were considered as the most worthy ones to handle the decision about existence of their own kind. You see, to know who is the good"" one has to face the hell in himself and then we shall see who maintains to fight through the difficult path to become a good man and who will fall and maintains to fulfill his temporary pleasures. SO what about the movie overall? It is a motion picture for open minded audience, with quite good CGI effects and admirable practical ones. Another great soundtrack from Clint Mansell, which music haunts throughout the film. Solid acting from both the elders and youngsters. Lesson about moral questions are really precious, and this movie has many of it. If you have seen Aronofsky's work before, then you shall know what to expect, and still gonna be shocked in some way. I liked it, and cannot wait for DVD to watch it again. P.S.: I would advise to not let this picture seen by younger than 18, at least. It's quite provocative in places if not outrageous.",Noah
251,HaveWisdomWillTravel,Promised-To-Upset-Everybody Interpretation of an Over-interpreted Fantastical Tale,5,16 April 2014,"I remember thinking - after the movie - both the religious and secular will complain about this movie, and accuse the director of playing the other team. Looking at the reviews here, yep...First... am not religious nor atheist-materialist, and am curious enough to have studied cross-cultural prophecies and ancient flood myths. Am very aware that there are many Noah figures in ancient human history, in China, India, Americas and the Pacifics, so apocalyptic flood stories interest me. Also saw the epic fantasy special effects promised by the trailer. Aronofsky has a strong portfolio, and is very daring to tackle a holy book myth... Verdict: an unapologetic, fantastical interpretation of an already fantastical legendary tale, with the usual flaws and incoherence typical of big Hollywood studio product. High quality in some areas, terrible in others... The good first... Good cast. Especially unaffected acting from Emma. Very original creation of lifeforms. Interesting depiction of ""giant angels"". Awesome scenes of animals and vegetation. Visual imagination is Aronofsky's strength and this movie once again showed it. Also a reminder to the non-religious ones, where the concept of Eugenic Selection and ""divinely ordained"" genocide ideas originated from. Definitely explains why some humans think other humans are beneath their favorite pet animals and hence deserve no attention than predatory reptiles or sharks. Religious teachings that involve child sacrifice and self-hate are always fascinating in a horrific and educational way to the child-loving and self-caring onlookers. Basically, these are timeless themes worth exploring.The weak parts... Pacing too draggy. Russell obviously too flabby for a vegetarian messenger cum hands-on ship-builder living on famish survival condition, his chubbiness exaggerated by his wife Jennifer Connelly's designer anorexic frame. The exploited to death ""father-son petty fighting when the world is ending"" trope. The exploited to death ""conservative parents think protecting MY FAMILY justifies murders of subhumans from the rest of the world"" trope. Okay now we know where these Hollywood fixations originated from, but come on our director/writers obviously take creative license here, so why overdo more of the same overdone American mainstream clichés?Other jarring bits: women in this story are strong only in the long-suffering hardship-tolerance department. They remain haplessly subservient and weak-will against the tyranny and zealotry of the family patriarch. Why didn't the director take the already-liberal creative license even further and do some justice to the female species - the favorite scapegoat of formal religions? Okay, to be fair, the female scapegoating was probably played out to ""explain"" why formal religions tend to bastardize their daughters as inherently sinful sub-species to the sons. I only wish the women stop using tears sometimes and just stand up for themselves when they have the chance.So where is the director in the religion vs secular divide? I reckon he is taking NEITHER side. Not even on the fence. Just his own unique, original, unapologetic position. Because his tone is unapologetic, many will take offense, or get paranoid. The fanatical moralists will complain about Noah being portrayed as a psychopath or fascist and ""director is atheist!"" ""director is a Christian-hater!""... The fanatical atheists will complain about Noah being made too moral and likable and justified in his chosen-one special status, ""director is Christian!"", ""director is trying to convert me!"".Then again those expecting Thor or 2012 will complain. I belong to this group of complainers. I watched it with my agnostic other half and church-going in-laws. Everyone had different response, so I won't say go or don't watch it. Just expect yet another interpretation of an intepreted-to-death-since-2345BC story. If one could put aside the need for logic and paranoid religious partisan politics, and brace oneself for grim Lord of the Rings atmosphere, one may actually be entertained.",Noah
252,UnderworldRocks,Pity! Could have been so much more.,5,9 July 2014,"The graphics are so grand and epic, that the film could almost make an audience believe in God, well, almost.But the film suffers from laughable plot design and lack of subtlety, which keep the film from truly being great.First, why must Naya be so damn lucky and get absurdly caught in the one trap in the miles of endless forests? Bingo! Had she not been trampled, she should really go see if she could win the lottery!Second, Noah says all he could see is love when he looks at those two girls, but the plot twist comes unconvincingly, because a moment before he raises the blade, preparing to stab the infants, his eyes are bloody red with rage, his mind bent on completing God's plan by destroying mankind.Third, in the end the two girls are the future. So how does the human race start from there? How can it ""be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth""? Through incest? Fourth, fifth, sixth The list goes on and on. There are so many places in the poor film that remain to be tweaked, rendering the final film mediocre and less than satisfying. Noah has the great potential to be a great film.

254,j-madej,Maybe Aronofsky should have gone the Mel Gibson path and do it in the original language maybe then it would have been more believable.,7,11 April 2014,"I must say I have a mixed feelings about the Darren Aronofsky's biblical tale ""NOAH"". On one hand we have a big well crafted blockbuster that is tying to tell one of the oldest stories known to mankind. Of course there is another story of it's kind of what arguably is predating the biblical story about the great flood called the ""Epic of Gilgamesh"". On the other hand, making a movie about the events written in the Old Testament and putting it literally on the screen (in this case he took an artistic liberty to deviate from the original having an individual different take on it) something that people believe in as their all apparent faith, can be very difficult task itself indeed. The difficult task is to keep it probable to not venture in the direction of fantasy style of LOTR type storytelling. Aranofsky, who's work I hugely admire, here unfortunately did not succeeded fully. It is a very difficult task to bring pages of the Bible in to reality and not to make it as an unbelievable fairy tail. IN reality Darren stuck with keeping the narration of the story in 3 acts, each with a separate objectives and obstacles. By doing so in theory keeping us engaged in this 139 minutes long and epic story.First act consist of introduction the history of Adam & Eve and their offspring showing that the humanity evolved from their sons up until Noah and his family as well as the other clan of Cain and their leader Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone)and messianic task that Noah believes he needs to safe the innocent (the animals) to repopulate the Earth, after the Gods judgement (the flood).Second act consists of development the individual stories of the characters as well as finishing work on the Arc. For story to work you need to have a protagonist (our hero) and antagonist (his enemy).The act 3 after the flood becomes bit tedious. Aronofsky is trying to create a tension based of Noah's obsession with obedience to the will of God to purify the Earth that ultimately allowed him to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of people he judged not worthy and pure enough to be let in on to the Arc. Even on the arc itself the fact that one of the occupants ends up having an offspring becomes a source of tension, aggression and alienation of the family from Noah who wants to finish the task and sacrifice the children for the sake of the purification of Earth for human kind. This fact makes him to some extant antagonistic in nature even though Ray Winstone is the official baddie.What safes this film is the performances. The acting from everyone is very heart felt dramatic and believable, specially Jennifer Connelly who plays Noah's faith full wife. She has one great scene when she confronts Noah and that scene for me practically stole the whole movie in terms of performances. Russell Crowe as the lead character offers subdued meditative performance that showcases a little bit different sides to his character changing from act to act. On top of the standard epic shots Aronofsky does what he did on ""Wrestler"" Some hand-held camera work often following the characters around creating more of a documentary feeling to a scenes. Like I mentioned before, the fact is that it is very difficult to make a movie of a religious Biblical allegory and develop a realism, when Noah have helpers who help him to create the arc, who are in reality a form of a fallen angels, who are trap on Earth as gigantic lava monsters. Things like this create giggles from the audience. ""Noah"" is definitely worth checking out for the acting alone. I like Aronofsky and Noah is his most epic movie not counting ""The Fountain"". This is only his 5 feature movie after ""Pi"" and I do like his full of depth narrative style but here he might have bite off more than he can chew. ""Noah"" is not a bad movie at all but it is not as great as we would hope for. Maybe he should have gone the Mel Gibson path and do it in the original language maybe then we would forgive the talking and walking stone monsters that we should believe helped Noah to build the arc.",Noah
255,blufrog49,Just plain silly,3,30 March 2014,"May contain spoilers! Mix parts of Steven King's ""The Stand,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""The Lion King,"" ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""300"" and Disneyland's Enchanted Tiki Room, with fashion and accents from Sherwood Forest, and you've got this version of the story of Noah.I wasn't surprised to read that all the animals were digitized--they certainly didn't look real--very poor animation, in my opinion. Not only did the men wear pants (and vests, and coats and scarves), the women looked pretty hot in their tight jeans as well, even right after giving birth.I didn't expect a story ""true"" to the Bible, but I certainly wasn't prepared for the Rock Trolls (yes, I stole that term from another reviewer).

256,eragonbookfan,Watch Kent Hovind's and/or Ken Ham's seminars! ... seriously,4,1 July 2014,"Man... it seemed as if Satan was possessing Noah for the last 3rd of the movie!First off, I am a Christian, and a creation science evangelist, and I like Darren Aronofsky for being Jewish - I love Jewish people, I think they have had a really sad history of being persecuted; they should be respected & honored for being incredible smart & intelligent throughout history as well (ie. Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, Charlie Chaplin, Jennifer Connelly, Marcel Maceau, Indina Menzel, etc)However, they're human and make mistakes too. And this is one of them from Mr. Darren himself.I'm not upset with this film because I'm ""religious"" - I'm upset because it was simply disrespectful, unfaithful, & misleading. I really REALLY wanted to like this film - from the looks of the trailer, it seemed awesome! I had really wanted to see a big-budget film made about the Noah & the Ark, the worldwide flood, God's plan of hope & salvation, etc. But hey, who knows how many ""good"" trailers there have been to bad movies.Hollywood has had a LOOOOOOOOOOOOONG history of misrepresenting the God, the Bible, and being just blasphemous.With this film, the music & the special effects were cool, but the characters & the story, as a whole ,were not cool. I did appreciate this film for the size & scope & realism it had, but what I hated most about it was how they turned the main man ""Noah"" into a MAD MAN! Plus, they never refer to the Creator as ""God""; and the director has been this ""Creator"" to be a very WEIRD one at that. See, Darren, the Bible is not a ""comic book"" where you could change whatever you want for some film adaptation; no, it's a HISTORY book! Changing things to the account is like Michael Bay changing what he did in ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001). Anyways, Noah was a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter 2:5)! Noah had 3 sons alright, but they were supposed to have wives!And Noah certainly wasn't an ""extreme environmentalist"", and he certainly did not, I repeat, DID NOT want to murder any part of his family, like his two granddaughters! In turn, making Shem & his wife wanting to leave the Ark on a small raft; and the whole family starts fighting... NONE of that Scriptural!!! Everyone in the movie was reasonably telling Noah to stop acting like a murdering psychopath! And it's definitely not what God would want one of His people to do! God is pro-Life, real Bible-believing Christians are pro-Life; it's a bad impression making it seem as if God wants to kill babies! lol wuuuuuuuuut!!?? Noah should have reasonably OVERJOYED to see his family was already growing - it was a hope that they could begin a whole new GOOD family & generation! Tubul-Cain, the ""bad guy"", certainly did not find his way onto the Ark. Almost all the time, I was sitting there in the theater, raising my hands, saying, ""Whaaaaat!?""Especially when Noah, or should I say Russell Crowe, explains God's creating of the universe, it's all done with EVOLUTION! I'm actually beating a dead horse with a stick, but Darwinian evolution is NOT Science! Evolution is not mentioned in the Bible, it's certainly not the God of the Bible that would use ""evolution"" - the type of ""god"" that would use a silly idea like evolution would be cruel, wasteful, and retarded. I wouldn't worship a God like that! Doesn't He know what He wants?? Can't He make it right in 6 Days?? *POOF!* Or Six Seconds?? Why does your god have to practice & play around?? You have to trade your God in for a real one! Evolutionism is unscientific & unprovable, and it's dogmatic, carefully protected state RELIGION! Everything between the Bible & evolution is BACKWARDS!Near the end of the movie, I felt like crying, especially when I saw Noah drinking grape juice (turned into wine), all disgusting, really putting the cherry on top as making him being the ""psychopath"". (BTW, stop there. Actually I think Noah got drunk accidentally, even in the scriptures. The former atmosphere of the earth was completely different before the Flood - things wouldn't decay, rust, die, age or ""ferment"" as fast before.)Overall, this film left me shocked, depraved, depressed, & tired. This film was banned in several countries, and I apparently don't blame them. (Not that I hold to their beliefs or reasons why.)PS: I'm actually glad this film has INCREASED reading of the biblical book of Genesis - hopefully people can be well-informed of the holy inspired-text instead of this anti-biblical film.If someone ever does come across this review of mine, it WOULD mean a lot to me :-)",Noah
257,feritciva,Lessons from Noah,3,24 April 2014,"1) Noah was a wise shaman-like man once, caring about flora & fauna balance and animal life. Ehm, he may have some temper problems - as killing hunters - but c'mon, which one of us didn't think to do this when we saw killings of cute baby seals in North pole? 2) Noah is a sociopath/psychopath - and a very effective one - when he's possessed. By whom or what? It's uncertain but obviously it's not Prime Creator. Enlil anyone? Maybe. Then where is Enki in this story? 3) Jennifer Connelly is the ultimate saviour of human kind. She once begged for us in The Day The Earth Stood Still, now she does it again! Very possibly this is because of Jareth - the Goblin king that she met in the very first days of her career. As we all know Jareth is one of the coolest characters in whole movie history. He might have given her some clues on what to do.4) Transformers were not from some other planet. They were here all the time.5) I will not say any bad thing about 2012 movie again.6) Somewhere in the shadows Roland Emmerich is smiling and shaking his head ""you should have given this project to me"".",Noah
258,khemass,"Should not be about ""Noah""",7,22 November 2017,"I'm a fan of Darren Aranofsky. I love ""Requiem for the dream"" and ""The Fountain"" so much. But for ""Noah"", I must say that it's quite a wrong decision to create it under the name of a Biblical character. Personally, I think that the theme of this movie is not bad at all, it's just that you have to make a separate movie, because if you create something based on the Bible, at least better give the character and the original story some respect. At least you have to keep the main message. Actually, I really enjoyed the first half of the film and the addition of characters like the giants or Noah's grandfather. It doesn't destroy the story and the good message of the original Noah story. I also like the way creation of the world is told. But after half way, the story is such a mess. The son and daughter-in-law issues, the evil man who has sneaked into the ark eating away some of the animals, the insanity of Noah and his misinterpretation of God's will that make him want to kill his own grandchildren. All of these should not be in the story of ""Noah"" because, according to the Bible, Noah is a man of God, the few good ones left on the surface of the Earth who could really hear what God tells him to do. According to the Bible, Noah and ""all"" of his family (in-laws included) are on the ark. Noah tried to warn everyone for years about the flood but no one listened to him. He didn't try to block other people from getting into the ark. He is hopeful about human's future and was expecting dry land so that he, his family, and the animals can settle down again. I know that a movie is a piece of artwork and the story can have additions and points of view according to the filmmaker, but at least it should not make people confused about who Noah is in the Bible. But still, there are some aspects that I like about the film. How sin infiltrates human, how beings of light can get stuck in Earthly form as punishment, and how human is supposed to have stewardship over other creatures on Earth, to care for them and not to destroy. The idea that God doesn't want to erase all mankind but to give a new beginning and a new hope. The performance of the cast was flawless in my eyes and the special effects are OK too. The movie is a bit slow-pace but that didn't bother me. I just simply didn't like how the filmmaker twist the story too much that it doesn't do respect to the original theme and character of Biblical Noah story.",Noah

260,peterkowalski,Ah no.,4,26 July 2014,"From the director of truly outstanding, brave movies - Requiem for a dream, Pi or the Black Swan, all of them being groundbreaking in one way or another, all of them being a brilliant psychological study of a human psyche, here comes a story of a hero. The Biblical story of a man whose faith saved his life - and the lives of several other species. One of the greatest stories ever told/written/imagined (pick one accordingly to your own faith). It is also a story of a once genius director selling out his own beliefs for no other reason than to make money.Alright, let's start with the good: Noah, according to Aronofsky, is not a nice bearded gentleman; he's a dark creature willing to forsake his own daughter in order to please the God, to which he has devoted his life. And in Noah we see a glimpse of the good, old Aronofsky. And the visual effects are also nice, which should not come as a surprise given the movie's massive budget. And that's about it.What's bad, is everything else. Bad, bad, overplayed acting. The Hollywood ending. The idea of the Stone Creatures, without which, apparently, the Arc would not have been built.

Russell Crowe is generally okay in his role of Noah, other actors are solid also, but for me the best performance came from Ray Winstone who is playing Tubal-Cain, there also some things which irritated me, especially the part when Noah have dilemma to kill the Illa's child, it is too long and Ema Watson is not so good in that part of the movie.

264,ad_upclose,Aronofsky's dark artistic strokes find a place in a largely spectacle-filled production,9,31 March 2014,"Aronofsky's version of Noah is based on a graphic novel, so there seems to be some creative license taken for those hoping this would be a narrative closer to the scriptures. I suppose if a studio is going to tackle divisive material, it may as well recruit the likes of Aronofsky. It may be deemed as bold in certain instances and all the elements in place, the film ultimately comes off as an impressive dark fantasy epic. Those looking for an abundance of salacious qualities may not be satisfied barring a couple of scenes.Noah is interesting in that it is offers more than mere set-up to the preordained flood. There is a dark-turn to the story once the gargantuan ark sets sail (without sails I should add) which comprises of a visually stunning montage featuring the creation of the universe/earth. The most interesting part of the story is the character of Noah, he is not portrayed as a hero people may be expecting and some sequences even raise serious questions about his sanity. This grey depiction of the storied character is where a large part of the narrative's originality lies.The film's excessive cost pays dividends as most of the CGI & filming in general is quite beautifully rendered. Also, the cast does a fine job even when the story lingers with the family dynamics. Crowe as the titular character maintains an impressive presence and shows a range of emotions not seen from him since his Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind days.Overall, Aronofsky's dark artistic strokes find a place in a largely spectacle-filled production. Noah creates an immersive cinematic experience which is believable within its own existence.*The film did raise a question for me though, could you imagine what that ark would smell like with all those confined animals?

265,born_naughty,Predictable and non-threatening CGI movie.,4,22 April 2014,"I don't know much about the ""real"" story of Noah. But from the parts I do know, it seems it should be about nature. It should be about the good and about the beauty of nature, animals and even humans. CGI rock monsters fighting legions of enemies and CGI animals coming in millions to the ark does not exactly make me feel closer to nature. BTW, the ark seems WAY too small for all those animals! There's way too much CGI in this movie and (apart from a few short shots at the end) there's not one real animal to see in this whole movie. So I never felt there was anything worth protecting. That being said, Noah has the task of building an ark and rescuing 2 off each animal. But with God himself very clearly backing him up from the beginning, what does he have to fear? He has rock monsters on his side and ""The Creator"" himself doing everything. Noah just has to make the ark, that's all, everything else is done for him. If something goes wrong, God will help him because Noah is the chosen one. Only at the end when the inevitable flood comes it seems God had somewhat left Noah to his own. Then there's a bit of a threat. But even that is destroyed by a plot line that doesn't make any sense. If you want human kind to end and there are 6 people left on the earth, what do you do? Okay so you decide not to kill everyone and let them live their lives. Their are 2 women left. 1, we'll just presume she's too old to have children, or maybe she's just never gonna have sex again. The younger one, let's call her Sarah, they thought can't have children becomes pregnant. What do you do? Noah decides to wait and if the baby is a girl (who would possibly have children in the future) then he will kill her. But what about Sarah? She can still have children? You should kill her too right? The option is not even considered here. Also, Noah doesn't let anyone in his group eat meat. So how are they living? What are they eating on the ark? Their are some possibilities here but they never explain anything. The movie feels content do just show us CGI rock monsters and CGI rainbows from God instead. Very disappointing. Certainly because there is some good here. There are some more then decent performances, a lead actor that can do a lot better, and some story lines here and there that could have been fleshed out. Also, the movie is never boring, but it does feel like you're wasting your time because you know exactly how it's going to end from the beginning. And you were right all along.",Noah
266,Gin-ster,Pretty awful but has some good sci-fi touches,5,10 August 2014,"I approached this with some trepidation as I feared it would be ponderous, like doing your homework instead of watching a vid. However, it was awful, but for different reasons. I don't know if this is a ""spoiler"" or not, but just in case, I'll frame it as such, so, SPOILER ALERT - it was far afield from the story as written in the Bible. That is fine, I could care less about that problem - but for the record, it adds a lot, clearly striving to hit a deeper level of emotional resonance as far as psychological depth and high melodrama. And the stuff it adds is really annoying, making Noah seem like a sadistic psychopath. At one point SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - he is holding a knife over his newborn granddaughters who he has vowed to kill because God presumably told him to end the human race (along with all the other critters that just got nuked) - and while I knew that Hollywood would not allow him to knife the infants, the whole sight of it was so repellent that it had you wishing he'd fall overboard and drown.I have no illusions about the Biblical account being ""heartwarming"" but the nastiness of Noah's attitudes in this and other episodes made for an almost unwatchable experience. One good thing, though, hence the sci fi comment - these neat rock thingies out of a sci fi movie helped Noah get his ark built (accompanied, as he was, only by young boys plus some of the most ""helpless female"" characters you will see in recent movies). It was a foregone conclusion that the rock beings (SPOILER SPOILER) who were some magical light-beings imprisoned in rocks by God for earlier misbehaviors would ultimately be freed (yay!) but still, it was fun having them around and made it almost possible to view the movie as mediocre sci fi for a few minutes here and there (hence an improvement). Overall, though, it is a fascinating study in how things can go so far wrong with repellent story-writing added to a Biblical saga that strains the bounds of modern morality as it is. I suspect the viewpoint of modern audiences would be to recoil at the thought of all life on earth facing genocide at the hands of an angry God; and somehow Aronofsky and company have made the tale even crueler.",Noah
267,ayaan-bretmitchell,Typical anti religious idiots rating it low.,9,27 June 2020,I liked this film the first time around and I still do second time round.This film (and films if this ilk) will always get low ratings as humans are incapable of believing there's a bigger power than their selfish selves.It's Noah and although tells the famous story it does deviate in many places but the point is still in there as well. ie that there's a creator and he knew more than we did.Good film.,Noah

269,lucas739,Oh Noah!,3,6 August 2014,"I really tried to like this film, i gave it every chance, i tried to see past its shortcomings but alas i couldn't lie to myself.....it was pants! Trying to nail down any particular reason as to why this film fails is difficult, so much of it was misjudged. partly down to the human characters, especially having Ray Winstone as the King, poor judgement ""Oi ahm the fackin' King innit"". Crowe dusting off his gladiatorial nobility role....again. The rock characters failed to have any wow factor. Constructing an oblong ark just looked so naff. The tonality of the film had that typical cgi grey/blue pallor. Overall it was a mishmash of an effort, part historical, part make believe but most part crap.",Noah
270,CrisMovieCorner,A Biblical Epic to rival most!,6,17 September 2014,"Where to begin when it comes to ""Noah"", it's a safe bet to say anything Biblical or Russell Crowe related usually doesn't interest me at all. That being said when I seen the trailer for this I was intrigued to see what the end product would be.Darren Aronosky is known for his smaller budget films, just take a look at his filmography I believe ""Noah"" cost more than his previous 6 films combined and doubled! However this didn't case him to shy away from using that budget his ambition and crazy execution can be seen throughout the entire film.The entirety of mankind has been stained by the descendants of Cain, so ""the creator"" has took it upon himself to cleanse for a better word the globe. Noah (Crowe) receives this message through a vision finding out the creator will be bringing a flood to end times. He in turn decides to build an ark to survive the flood and preserve the animal kingdom. A little ""History"" lesson for those who don't know the Ark story.The Biblical version of this myth states that the survivors on the Ark are Noah, his wife, his three sons and their wives. However, Aronofsky took a different approach on board we have Noah, his wife, Japheth a young boy, Ham an adult but not married and Shem who is married but to a barren wife or so we are led to believe plus one surprised addition you have to watch in order to appreciate. While on the Ark Noah is dealt a dilemma to rival any of man before or after said event. His daughter-in-law falls pregnant with twin girls, should he kill his grand-daughters? Therefore ensuing the END of humanity, or should he show mercy and let them survive which goes completely against what his belief in the creator wants him to do.While the film itself is an epic in pretty much every aspect, some of the CGI can fall short at times, like the rock monsters (Watchers) look very dated to me for some reason. The actual flood and ark are phenomenally done, done well enough that you can really imagine the fear that man at that time would have experienced.Overall the film was an enjoyable watch, it was a bit long though coming in at just over two hours it does begin to drag a bit. Some of the acting as well was a bit bland especially from Lerman who comes across very wooden and Booth who only seems to be there to be a pretty face. On the other hand, Crowe was incredible, first time I have truly enjoyed a performance by him after watching this I am seriously considering going into his back catalogue and watching stuff I've avoided by him.The film could be a stepping stone Aronofosky to get into more big budget films, the film has everything you expect from an epic full of over the top action sequences, nice CGI, pretty good acting. I personally would recommend this as a popcorn flick, do not watch if you're looking for a film with substance.",Noah
271,jon-c-ison,Weirdly incoherent but good despite this,6,12 July 2020,"Fantasy based very loosely around the story of Noah and the flood from the bible. It's rather a strange mix of biblical story, morality tale, character play and fantasy action movie. Russell Crowe and the other actors generally do a great job, but I feel were let down by the movie's major flaw - it's incoherence. There are too many competing different vibes- littered with alternately clumsy or cheesy moments. So the experience is schizophrenic. Had they picked just one thematic type and stuck with it, it may have been much better, even great.. Nonetheless, if you go with it, it's very entertaining - even profound (when it's not being absurd). This may be a very different movie to the one that you're expecting. Worth a watch. but watch without preconceptions!",Noah

273,i_ianchev,Noah,7,6 April 2014,"The exhausting journey of mankind between destiny and choice...I watched the new cinematic piece by Darren Aronofsky one week ago, but I couldn't bring myself to write about it until now. That is because this movie is very controversial. But not in the way many people think of it - religious VS artistic interpretation. I hesitated because I didn't want to be disappointed that much when writing about it. I wanted to think about what I saw and then write about its form and substance.The new heroic journey of Mr. Russell Crowe and his team of dramatic experts - Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone and Emma Watson - is rather epic, but it doesn't show us many new thoughts on this piece from The Old Testament. And we didn't see much character development in most of the actors in it. Yes, Russell Crow is rather impressive, but I expected something new, a beam of light to shine through the silver screen, as it did before when I watched Aronofsky's previous movies (""The Black Swan"", ""The Fountain"", ""Pi"" or ""Requiem for a dream""). I felt enormous anticipation for something more provocative and daring, something entirely new as a viewpoint. And I almost didn't get it. I say almost - because during this week of delay, I weighed the performance of the main actors again.Yes, we didn't get much of an enlightenment, but we saw at least four characters who were struggling with their inner demons as we humans do every single day. We can all feel in our hearts the sense of destiny that lies around us. We all connect to the thought that no matter what we do, our paths are destined to go only one way. But it is true also that we can shape our deeds according to our own will and choices. We model each step we take and we decide what we take as good and evil. Yes, our perception of these two change almost every day, but in the end, we know that it was our choice which shaped our destined path. Indeed we are all prone to explain to ourselves every mischief or every success with a higher power, but since ancient times we want to change and try to change the course of our lives. And we often do that. But all within the time limit which we have.Having this said I would like to express my gratitude for Russell Crow's, Jennifer Connelly's and Anthony Hopkins' performance. They all did a very, very good job. And my general impression is that acting was very good. It was the script that didn't feel too much innovative. But it is important to say that Aronofsky made a very watchable epic movie. He will not be remembered for it (compared to his previous masterpieces), but he will surely make some money for the studio. The sound and the special effects were very good - powerfully complementing the story. The makeup and the clothing did represent an era long forgotten. The artisans' job seemed impressive indeed.In the end - we got what they prepared for us - a movie within the limits of the blockbuster screen writing, but with the potency of modern acting schooling.",Noah

I believe this film would have been 10 times better if they just skipped all the phony baloney CGI i.e. the watchers, and kept it more down to earth. Everyone knows this story so by ""jazzing"" it up with lots of special effects just takes away from a very good story that could have been told.

277,swellframe17,"""Day and night shall not cease.""",7,2 July 2014,"3 out of 4 stars.""Noah"" is a very different Darren Aronofsky film. Aronofsky, who is not a very religious man, takes on the Biblical tale of Noah and the ark. This film is very religious without being preachy (which I liked). I'm a big fan of Aronofsky and was excited to see where he would take the story. Some of his additions are interesting while others may leave you scratching your head (like the giant rock monsters that are angels and the made up animals throughout the film). Aronofsky's ""Noah"" is a flawed film. The first half of it is like many of Aronofsky's films. It's more of a subjective narrative focusing on Noah (played well by Russell Crowe) and what his dreams are showing him. He's obsessed with his dreams and has to become a different person to do what The Creator demands (I don't think the film ever uses the word God). Halfway through the film, though, it suddenly becomes much more blockbustery and becomes an adventure film with more story lines that don't always seem necessary. Noah can go from being a very peaceful man to a violent fighter and magic changes characters in just seconds. Some of these plots seem a little too forced and serve to make the film more epic than it needs to be.The sudden shift in the film and all the different story lines hinder the film, but there are some great moments thanks to Matthew Libatique's dark cinematography and Clint Mansell's haunting score. I mean this as a compliment when I say my favorite part of the film is the end of it. Aronofsky brings everything together very well at the end and everything is working together. The themes of the film become fully realized in a beautiful montage.What I also enjoyed about this film is how it focuses on the humanity of the situation. Imagine being called upon by a God or Creator to let everyone else die around you, but you being able to live. How would that make you feel? How could you go on after? The focus on the grays in the film show that this isn't a black and white situation. Russell Crowe surprised me with how well he carried the role and focused on Noah's humanity. ""Noah"" may not be one of the best films of the year, but I think it is one of the most interesting. If you see this movie, go into it with an open mind. This movie isn't very preachy and isn't trying to throw the Bible down your throat. Aronofsky took artistic liberties and takes a small story to a grand scale. Hate it or love it, it will get you talking and make you think about the story of Noah and the ark in a different way.",Noah
278,zterrell,Sad it's so Bad.,1,29 July 2014,"I have to wonder why this wasn't titled: Stupid Noel's Rainy Day Adventure. After all, it has very little in common with anything written in the Bible.As I see it, having someone promote this as a Biblical work is like the Pope telling people they can't use contraceptives -- If you don't know anything about playing the game, you shouldn't be the one making the rules.Noah, by the end of picture proves he is the dumbest man on the face of the planet.Aside from the content, there was little to bond the viewer to any of the cast. Emma Watson is about the only one a person can find any empathy for and the idea of a stowaway...? One who stays hidden until the dove returns? Well, that isn't a spoiler, because the movie already smelled like week old fish.",Noah
279,zevt,Deeply disappointed in Aronofsky,1,16 February 2018,"Hollywood has a bad history of Biblical epics, replacing subtlety, religious introspection and depth with spectacle, special effects, action sequences and superficial 'romance'. On the other hand, this is Aronofsky (and I am a fan of all his movies) so I was hoping for something more.Right from the start it felt wrong: An attempt to convert the complex story of Noah into a biblical Lord of the Rings. I then thought that instead of expecting it to be the story of Noah, that I could try to just enjoy it as a pure fantasy flick and as a story unrelated to the Bible. But this proved impossible to do, given what I know and how much they used from the original story combined with so many endless annoying distortions and missed opportunities. And even taken as its own story, it suffers from inconsistencies and poor writing.Indeed, many of my criticisms come from comparing this to the Bible story. But even if you don't believe in it, this is the equivalent of taking a great book that everyone knows and loves, removing all the interesting stuff, replacing it with your own invented modern dramatic elements and thrills, and stuffing it with Hollywood spectacle just to keep people entertained. Which means they thought the original story wasn't good enough. So why start with the story of Noah in the first place? Obviously, just to exploit its popularity.Examples:Let's start with the 'Watchers': There are Nefilim in the Bible, but traditional sources give them a completely different form and story. In the movie they are Transformer-like ex-angel creatures of stone that are confused and emotional, behaving like humans, that 'fell' in order to help humans, and who have lost their way after humans disappointed them. The actual story is about angels seduced by humans and fallen from grace thanks to the corruption of the earth, trying to turn themselves into humans and interacting with the human world and causing distortions and evil. In other words, they were a symptom of the general corruption of creation where even angels fell. Which is scary and interesting in itself and can even easily lend itself to a Hollywood spectacle, so why change it? Plus the change makes no sense: Why would angels 'fall' in order to help humans? In order to fall, first something has to go wrong. Also, they can help from wherever they are! All of which shows what I said earlier: Not only did they change things unnecessarily, they also made illogical changes.Another case in point: Noah was instructed to build the Ark, a job that would take 120 years. God could have made it spring up by some miracle or save Noah some other much easier way, but there was a point to make by having Noah build it in front of everyone for so long through hard work and dedication (to provoke them and give them a chance to think and see the work and correct their ways). So what does this movie do? It springs up a whole forest instantly through a huge miracle, then has the Watchers build the ark for Noah as quickly as possible, protected and hidden away from civilization, as well as has them protect Noah in a grand battle-massacre spectacle. Kinda missing the whole point aren't we?Other details:Noah here is an action-figure who does battle with evil men, killing them without remorse. Once again, Hollywood action over introspection. It's not a question over whether he had to kill due to self-defense in a land without morals, it's about on what the movie chooses to focus.And yes, once again, there is Hollywood romance and lust by the saviors of the world... In a Biblical movie about the moral deterioration of the world for crying out loud. In fact, they all do various bad things just in order to make them more human for us. And yet the Bible says they were righteous. So I guess righteous means that they were merely ahead of the rest in terms of brownie points? Except (spoiler) Noah turns out to be worse than the rest of the world...(spoilers) Noah turns out to be a misanthrope Vegan who would like to see all of humanity destroyed just so that 'nature' can be left untouched. This is really beyond offensive. For starters, besides the obvious change from the original story, this means that whereas the rest of the world were murderers, Noah would rather see animals live than a single human. Which makes him worse than the rest of the world. The immediate question is, according to this movie's warped (non)logic, why would he be saved? True, in the end he found his way to show mercy to human babies but this hardly makes him better than the rest - they didn't kill babies either (obviously, otherwise they wouldn't exist). Modern stories are often afraid of making their heroes inspiring and good people since that isn't 'realistic' and artistic, but this is taking it a bit too far don't you think? This movie actually turns Noah into a despicable evil man.Also, religiously, the world was created for man. Why on earth would Noah, a religious man, think that a world without humans made sense as long as animals get to live?! Evidently nobody put any thought into this screenplay.The care for the land by Noah and avoidance from eating animals is correct, except this is no vegetarian paradise: In the bible, right after the flood, in the new world that was created, Noah was given permission to eat animals. The movie conveniently ignores this part of the story just to create some kind of fantasy Vegan/environmentalist character.God speaks to Noah through dreams or he has to take a drug to see a vision like some Native American. Really? Way to undermine that interesting conversation with God.Traditionally, Noah was a complex mysterious character whose primary issue was over having the ability to save the rest of the world along with him and not going as far as he could. So what does this movie do? Throws all of this interesting stuff out and turns him into a Vegan fanatic. Talk about a missed opportunity.Noah fed the animals according to tradition, and had trouble with it, he didn't put them to sleep with some herb magic. Once again, a missed opportunity.Once in the ark, instead of introspection, we get a thriller subplot invented for the movie while Noah suddenly gets all misanthropic. The empty-headed changes to the story keep increasing by the dozens just to generate more cheap thrills. Imagine that: There is an apocalypse, and survivors have weeks to think about what just happened, but according to this movie, that's not enough.And so on and on... I am deeply disappointed in you, Darren Aronofsky. You had a chance to change the way Hollywood approaches Biblical movies with a rich complex story about people and humanity, and you chose a superficial, badly-written, fantasy action epic instead.",Noah
280,tinyone2,Difficult to watch,5,29 December 2014,"I found it difficult to watch because it portrayed cruelty without mercy. It doesn't turn its head away at the moment of impact nor tries to be shocking. In many horror or gruesome movies you know it's fake and imagined, so you can keep watching.This story cuts too close to the truth. At the point where the protagonist bites the head off one of the creatures in the ark I felt sick at it all.As a fictional story of great self exploration and imagery it is worth a see. I thought the acting and visuals were good. The story doesn't always go for the obvious Hollywood heroism, which makes it special. I gave it a 5 as it was a difficult movie for me to watch due to the fact that I couldn't separate the horror of cruelty from the fiction of a movie. But animal lovers eating meat should stay clear as I am not sure how I'll be able to chomp on a steak again soon.",Noah
281,MoviesRT,Possibly the stupidest adaptation to a true story ever!!,1,20 July 2016,"First off, we know from geological evidence as well as numerous historical tales that the flood of Noah actually happened. The fossil record alone supports it, so that's not a problem.With that being said, I guess it's up to no-believers to make up their own story about what actually happened.You can believe the Biblical account or make up your own.This is the latter. It's actually a dramatic story, but extremely idiotic. And Noah is made out in this version to be a complete madman. Why in the world would ""the creator"" tell Noah to save all the animals and then (spoiler...) kill himself and his whole family after the flood is over? I mean, how stupid is that? Anyway, the writer took the story to new depths, most of which made no sense, but I guess he has the freedom to do that if he wants. I just think that it was meant to entice people who believe in the Bible to come to the theater, only to be disappointed. Utterly...Maybe it would have been more accepted if the viewers knew up front that it would resemble the Lord of the Rings (what were those rock people anyway? ""watchers""? How silly.) So don't expect it to make sense or follow any logic.One last note: Why did he load the ark with every type of snake and lizard when we know evolution within species is a known fact. He only needed two of each ""kind."" Same with all those birds! Oh well, I guess I shouldn't have expected much, since I read many accounts about how much of a disaster it was.

282,kindtxgal,Even if You Don't Believe the Flood Occurred....,1,31 March 2014,"By far the WORST EVER movie I've seen in quite awhile! A real stinker. Think cross between Transformers (the rock monsters), Braveheart (only in black & white or sepia tones), and some whacked out sci fi movie. It was horrible. As was noted by almost every person who walked out of the theater. Russel Crowe revisits his Gladiator mode days as a sword wielding vegetarian patriarch (Noah) with a waifish wife (Jennifer Connelly) traipsing around in Robin Hood type leggings, and screaming pixie tribal woman Emma Watson. Seriously--- they didn't even do the ""rainbow"" correctly opting for rainbow new-agey circles at the end when everyone is setting up camp on the new land. Animals are a prehistoric/dragon like things. The story barely follows the original Biblical account.First, Noah and his family were considered to be the followers of God at that time. That said, it implies there was a relationship or understanding of some kind between he and God as far as the Word was revealed to mankind at that time.It is clear that the producer's agenda as an atheist and in this case propels him to want to misrepresent, malign, and slur the nature of God and His ability to communicate quite clearly His expectations and consequences if not adhered to. At that he doesn't even do a decent job. The film is clearly a handful of misunderstanding, lack of research, fantastical junk to promote a person's belief system, and not a factual account or retelling of a beautiful story.I could digress more on what those points are, but I could write a small book, so multiple are the misrepresentations. But for support of my review, for instance, the story of Abraham and Isaac had not even occurred at this point in the biblical timeline. Yet, there is a part of the movie where Noah is ""retelling"" the story of Abraham and Isaac. Without the story existing yet. There are so many flaws in the biblical timeline ""stories"" and retelling (such as Methusaleh's death who was NOT killed by drowning but of VERYYYY old age), it's abundantly clear that the writers/producers/directors chose BITS of things they picked up seemingly by osmosis, flung them together and retold a beautiful story from ONLY their sick point of view. Additionally, it is against the nature of God to promote infanticide. Period. God made a promise to Noah that he and his family would be spared because of Noah's relationship with God. The flaw in the film occurs long before the infanticide scene. Ham, Shem, and Japheth all had families PRIOR to the flood and were all allowed to all be on the ark. The Scripture is very clear on this point. When one chooses to avoid pertinent details in the rush to smear their own belief system through artistic endeavor, then this is the result. Confusion for the average viewer who is not well versed in biblical history, disgust from students of the Bible, and a big mess of a movie that wastes EVERYBODY's TIME. What's interesting is that NOBODY in the film appeared to have any peace. Well, except Anthony Hopkins when he finds a berry buried in the mud. Yet, Noah as a follower of the Creator had such faith in his God that he labored for 120 years to build a structure never built before and by the directives of God. That is part of the story as well. All of the heart of the story is lost in the sloppy handling of history, bias, and resentment about anything higher than oneself. I find it troubling that a creative mind is so sick that it also has to even create an infanticide probability in an attempt to destroy perfectly wonderful story of peace, promise and renewal. Skip this one, and if you are tempted to see it, wait until you can check it out at the local library for free. It's not even worth wasting a Redbox freebie token on!",Noah
283,anthonymora2,Noah Review,7,22 September 2014,"The film maker behind movies like Black Swan,The Wrestler,and Requiem for a Dream makes a big budget epic based on a biblical tale. I can see where audiences were divided.The story of Noah's ark is one I'm sure we're all familiar with regardless of how you were brought up.When I was a lot younger my family went to church and I remember Noah being my favorite story just because my imagination went wild with how something like that would look.This is not your grandma's version of the little Bible story folks.This is a dark, gritty, EPIC fantasy film.At least thats what I got.Russell Crowe owns the screen.As Noah he has the biggest character arc and man does this guy go through some mentally distressing trials.I loved that about this movie,you witnessed how Noah had so much put on him and even after the flood has even bigger family issues that will really test him.The special effects were great,the flood scene is of course amazing and the effects for the animals were also top notch.However the movie doesn't rely too much on the effects which I can appreciate.The rest of the cast is impressive as well,Emma Watson was a stand out.Darren Aronofsky is actually one of my favorite directors and while it may be missing a lot of his usual deep meanings,Naoh stills looks really good.The cinematography is beautiful and popped on my LED TV.If you're super stuck on just a faithful (HA! GET IT!?) adaption of the story you might be disappointed.However if you want an epic, edgy take on a Bible story,Noah will suffice.I recommend a purchase on Blu-ray,AT LEAST a watch.",Noah
284,thedukeofmovietown,How Maximus and Blasphemous Prime killed the world.,4,14 September 2014,"I just saw NOAH! Noah, directed by Darren Aronofsky, tells the classic story of how Noah, the last son of Seth, built an arc under orders from God, to protect all righteous creation from a massive flood meant to wipe out the evils of mankind. Now, this movie really has me torn because there's a lot in it that I liked and there's a lot in it that I didn't like.On the plus side, the performances here are truly astounding, especially Russel Crowe who gives us one more reason why he is one of the best actors in the world. The dialogue is beautifully written and the sets and the makeup are excellent in that, unlike a lot if other medieval style films in recent memory, they really help to sell the difficulty of life back in those days. There's also a sequence that, in my eyes, puts to bed the feud between science and creationism in a big ""you're both right"" moment that I think is worth at least $2 of the $10 admission price.Now we come to the other side of the coin. I would LOVE to give a rundown of everything wrong about this movie but in the interest of brevity and remaining spoiler free, I'll suffice to say that along with some sketchy (no lie)stop motion animation and iffy special effects, it takes A LOT of liberties with it's source material. To a degree I understand why, Noah is a relatively short story and you have to pad it out a little to make a movie here but when you find yourself saying, ""wait...WHAT?"" every 5-minutes and notice them ignoring well established segments of the story for the sake of jazzing it up, there's a problem. Some might say, ""eh, the story is unbelievable anyway, who cares if they embellish it a little bit."" Well, to them I say, what if I were to re-do Lord of the Rings with Frodo as a part of a 7-man mining team led by the man sized Dikini swordsman Madmartigan, and instead of one ring there were 5 and when their powers combined they made Captain Planet? Now that may be a fun movie but the Tolkien fans would be up in arms because its a betrayal of the source material. The reason it upset me is the same reason why others were so upset about Michael Bay's plans for Ninja Turtles and the same reason why Brandon Routh will never play Superman again. So as much as I like about Noah, it ultimately commits the sin of so egregiously betraying it's source material that the point of the story gets lost which, in this case, is just not forgivable. Noah gets a 2...out of 5.",Noah
285,filmbuff-05706,This Movie Deserves A Worldwide Flood.,2,25 July 2021,"The movie Noah, loosely based on the Genesis account of The Flood, is called a Biblical movie, however, it should not at all be considered so. Judging it as simply an epic, I suppose it's fine, but under the intended genre, it fails miserably.If I were to give a summary of the story found in Genesis 6-9, I would say it's about Noah, a man who is faithful to God, who is commanded by Him to build an ark so he and his family can be saved. Noah tries to warn his neighbors, who follow their own way rather than God's, and because they don't listen, they end up dying in the Flood.This movie, again, a loose adaptation of the story, stars Russell Crowe as Noah, a man told by God to build an ark in preparation for a Flood. However, this Noah does not preach mercy. He preaches vengeance.Noah, in this heretical movie, tells his neighbors that they can't be saved since they are so wicked and he warns his neighbors AGAINST entering the ark. That completely goes against the point of the story of Noah, he wanted his neighbors to have God's mercy, and they rejected it. Noah pursued his neighbors, he didn't reject them.There's other changes this movie contains and make no sense next to the Biblical account. There's fallen angels that look like rock monster Transformers, and they help build the ark.One of the neighbors actually enters the ark(he sneaks in) and he eats animals that, if memory serves, were made for the movie. Only one of Noah's sons has a wife, and she has twin baby girls on the ark. Noah, thinking the whole family is supposed to die eventually(WHY?) tries to kill them, but abondons this ""will of God '' because he fell in love with them when he saw them.Ignoring that this is a creation for the movie, that makes no sense. Imagine if Abraham had done that when nearly sacrificing Issac. I thought Noah was someone who put his whole trust in God?Another change this movie has is Noah learns of the Flood, not through God telling him, but by a dream where he is drowning. It is due to this dream that he thinks ALL mankind will die, among other non-Scriptural things out of character for Noah. There is too much to list to name it all.The story of Noah's Ark has the atheistic claim that it is plagarized from tales such as The Epic of Gilgamesh and other Flood legends of the era. Setting aside such an argument, director Darren Arnofsky has noted his film is a clash of these legends. I don't see a problem in making a film mashing such legends, but don't name it Noah and weave in elements of The Bible and call it a ""Biblical"" movie. Adapt the other stories, not the Genesis one.Another issue I have with the movie is that it proves that the story of Noah, which covers only 4 chapters of The Bible, is not fit for a 138 minute movie. Another 4 chapter Bible story, Jonah, has been adapted into an 83 minute movie that is put into the context of some kids who need to learn about mercy and compassion.Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie is for kids, but maybe this movie should have done what this one did- put the Noah story in a context of people who need to learn about God's mercy. That would have helped the film a ton.Noah's director, Darren Arnofsky, is an atheist. I'm not bashing that in particular, but it seems that as a non-religous person, Darren had no true respect for adapting his source material.I've heard that he had a fascination with the story of Noah for ages, (The Alantic has an article on this), but I guess my question is why did it have to be like THIS? Again, why not adapt the other Flood legends instead of messing with one millions of people cherish in their faith?I will give points to Noah for the points of the story that it gets right(which is very little), the acting, and for how well made it is. But if you want a faithful(no pun intended) version of the Bible story, this is NOT it.Noah is a decent movie AS a movie, but as a Biblical adaptation, it fails on nearly every level. I do not suggest this movie to any Christian(or any person who believes in Noah), and it's not good for anyone unless it's to treat it as a movie- I'd imagine that would be anyone else not in the previous category. On the whole though, Noah is a movie that deserves it's own worldwide flood.Reverse Recommendations: Here's 3 better movies that deal with the story of Noah:The Bible: In The Beginning(1966)John Huston, another atheist direcor, made a movie covering the first 22 chapters of Genesis. He personally plays Noah, and the Noah section covers a whole quarter of the movie's runtime. It's a little slow paced, but very well made.It also, in a positive way, proves my point that Noah's Ark alone is too short for a movie, since that alone covers about 43 minutes of the movie.Evan Almighty(2007) Proving my point that a modern context would have worked better, this comedy stars Steve Carrell, a congressman who is called by God to build an ark to save his city from a flood.Minnesota Cuke and the Search For Noah's Umbrella(2009) This VeggieTales video follows an Indiana Jones-type hero who learns from the story of Noah that being laughed at shouldn't stop you from doing the right thing.Note: There is one very inaccurate Bible movie that I deeply admire, that being Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ. That movie, which does not claim to be like The Bible(unlike Noah's DVD cover and other sources claim). That is my single exception to this argument, because while Biblically unsound it invokes many theological ideas, such as ""What could it be like to struggle with the fate of being crucified for mankind?""Edit: This was originally posted on 7/25/21, but heavy edits were made on 8/29/21.",Noah
286,TheReviewMaster,No to Noah,3,6 May 2015,"I am not religious in any way, shape or form. I decided to watch this purely because Aronofsky's name was on it, and since Requiem for a Dream I have been waiting for him to create something as mesmerizing. Noah failed to deliver. I found this as equally frustrating as ""Gravity"", both disaster movies in their own rights, and both filled with characters whose inner workings and decisions come off as annoying, illogical and selfish.Yes, I know this film was based on a bestselling book called The Bible, and I know it's based on one of the books' popular chapters, and I heard the story of Noah many times during my education at a Catholic school, but not even those pre-existing expectations helped me resonate with the story that was told.The only thing I cared about were the horribly distorted angels, and when they weren't on screen, I failed to invest in the main character and anyone else who was supporting his evident psychopathy which he obviously passed down genetically (stops typing and looks at a picture on the wall of the planet).",Noah

After sitting through this dark and dirt-filthy wretch of a movie, I wanted to take a shower.Blood and gore is a theme in some of Crowe's movies. In ""Gladiator"" the violence punctuated a period in history that saw brave men overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, giving the viewers many characters with which we could relate. ""Noah"" wallows in the blood and guts of killing, all for no discernible reason. It's worse than, ""Not your Ark, it's my Ark"", it's just killing.As Noah, a man we've come to believe saved mankind by God's hand, contemplates killing his just-born baby granddaughters - AFTER THE FLOOD SUBSIDES - I felt ill. No, stupid really. I love movies, always have. This is not a movie to be enjoyed on ANY level, it's worse than garbage.

And did I come out disappointed? NO...Story-line: That part is obvious. Noah is given the task of building an ark to shelter creatures that would restart the world after a flood destroys the present-but-sin-filled-world.Russell Crowe, in the titular role, is all in. The whole movie shoulders on him and he has carried it all the way with ease. With a supporting cast that includes Connelly, Watson, Lernman, Winstone, Hopkins, this movie could well be one of the front-runners next year in the Oscars in the Acting category.Next to Crowe what deserves the biggest applause is the visual department. Be it the black soil scenes or the deluge that destroys the world or the ""watchers"", the CG have given a huge hand (a rarity in Aronofsky's projects) to render an epic status to this epic story. Crowe's narration of how God created the world in six days is a must watch CG-experience, probably one of the best of all time.At 130+ minutes, this story might create a stretched feeling, especially after the deluge, but this was essential for Noah's character and for the story to take shape.I am a non-Christian and hence had a slight hesitation if my lack of biblical knowledge would wreak havoc to my movie experience. But, fortunately I was wrong and everything went like clockwork.Noah- Visually beautiful, Stunning Cast and thus A MUST WATCH..",Noah

Frankly, I didn't give much thought to how that story could be interpreted much differently. I was shown, in a seemingly never ending way, that it certainly could be interpreted differently.
It was a if an Atheist took about a quarter of the traditional Christian story, threw in a sprinkle of Scientology, a healthy pinch of Wiccan and a whole lot of WTF. Mixed with ever the ham Russell Crowe, poor Jennifer Connelly and sizable portion of CGI. Voila, out comes the most bizarre take on a well known story I've ever seen!

291,Hint523,"Admittedly flawed, but still a gripping Aronofsky film",8,17 April 2014,"A difficult film to rate or categorize because it continually battles between supreme epic and flawed blockbuster. The first great news is that Darren Aronofsky's vision does not feel lost, and it is clearly the director of modern masterpieces behind the wheel of this ship. What makes the film feel incredible is when these touches play out: its a gorgeous cinematic dream that captures all. The usage of the other Genesis stories within this one will be what makes the film so memorable in long term. But it still gets plagued by many moments that feel contrived and take the viewer out of the movie. This is where I settle on the score: I loved the film the entire time, but was able to recognize much of its clear weakness in story. It remains a triumph for blockbuster filmmaking, and exactly the type of project that I would love to see more of.",Noah

Noah behaves like a maniac, not like a righteous man with a high calling from God.All in all it is a fairy tale, using some elements of the biblical story and the names of Noah and the biblical characters. Far fetched, outlandish and expensive despicable mockery of the true biblical story.Avoid this hogwash.",Noah

Whaaaa...??? You can also count on movie tricks like: kids do something really dumb and jeopardize everything for no reason, villain dies...just kidding he is alive, and things look hopeless then at the last minute help arrives out of the ground.Just don't.

294,agblum,Biblical Accuracy Aside - Entertaining,8,6 April 2014,"Any Biblical Movie will automatically draws controversy to it – Is it true to what is said in the Bible? Is there anything added that offends, etc.?My Answer- A Movie is not a Documentary. While we would like a movie based on events that happened, or believed to have happened (depending on your beliefs in this case) to be the truth or as close to it as possible, in the end a movie is meant to entertain, while a Documentary is meant to give all the facts. Obviously it's impossible to do a documentary on Noah's Ark – We only know what is in the Bible, and Legends surrounding it. For all that I have learned to date of the story - If your looking for a straight forward version – You'll simply going to be disappointed. Liberties are taken with the story – at least to my knowledge. Having said that – Is Darren Aronofsky's movie entertaining? Yes. A wonderful cast, with Russell Crowe as ""Noah"", arguably one of the Best Actors on the Planet, re-united with his ""A Beautiful Mind"" Co-Star Jennifer Connelly as his wife ""Naameh"", both give great performances. Emma Watson, continuing to grow as actress post her ""Herimone"" role from the ""Harry Potter"" Films, also gives a great performance as Noah's Daughter In-Law Ila, coupled with Noah's Oldest – ""Shem"" – played by Douglas Booth. Of the three sons of Noah, the one that gets the most attention though is the Middle Son ""Ham"", with another re-uniting of Actors, portrayed by Watson's Co-Star from ""Perks of Being Wallflower"", Logan Lerman – also gives an effective performance.The Special Effects are generally good or good enough when underwhelming. It is the Actors that carry the day here. Per the Noah's Ark Story, the People of the Earth have become so corrupt – Most specifically the Descendants of Cain, as opposed to Cain's Brother Seth's Descendants, of which Noah is from. God - ""The Creator"" as he is referred to in the Movie, decides to end the world – sending visions to Noah of the Coming Flood, opposed to speaking directly to him. Again – Liberties taken.Tension is built, as Noah is shown to not be perfect himself, climaxing in the Final Act, when he has to make a choice that could tear his family apart. Overall, a well acted, generally effective movie. If you can remove yourself from all that is know from the Biblical story – And just take the movie as it – Not saying it's easy - Again, it is entertaining. 3 1 / 4 out of 4 Stars!",Noah
295,jmalmsten,Brutal and Bizarre. That's how I like my Bible movies.,9,21 April 2014,"To start of, I remember watching the first trailer for Noah and going ""Wow, another attempt to get a Passion of the Christ thing going. Playing into the whole bunch of arguments of the War on Religion that people keep saying is a thing. I mean, wow, who would actually want to make something that will be forgotten in a few months. Who would direct such dreck... oh... I'll be there opening night!""So yeah, to be honest I might be a bit biased. I have seen all of Arronofsky's films to date and the only one I didn't really love was The Fountain. So yes, there is a bit of fanboy warning going here.I sat down and watched it (not opening night as planned because of economic reasons, but in theater at least) And holy crap! They got away with quite a lot here in a PG13 rated film. Let's just say that this isn't really the cherry-picked happy happy joy joy version of the Noah- story that we are used to seeing in films like this. Nope, this is old school old testament brutality that we get to witness. Noah is a lover of animals yes. But he'll smack your teeth up in your brain-cavity if he needs to. And then there's the people of Cain that is, as another reviewer aptly put it, ""a few muscle-cars away from a Road Warrior gang"". Let's just say that things get brutal at times. And also I should mention the visuals. Because it is a strange beast, this. Going by the story it's supposed to be ancient times and all that entails. But there are allusions to the possibility that this isn't quite the case. Giant iron pipes permeate the mining of some mysterious glowing explosion-ore. Heck, Tubla-Cain even sports a welders helmet at one time. And it's all set in this highly stylized world where flat- lands and arid wastelands is mostly all there is until Noah plants a seed from the original Garden of Eden and a whole forest springs up overnight. After the film I read that Arronofsky co-operated with french comic-book artists and made a version of this story in 2011 and I can clearly see the influence from there. And we also get some montages done in a pseudo-stop-motion/timelapsy way that is at once jarring and disjointed but still great to look at. If you suffer from visually induced epilepsy, this might not be the film for you. The story very much follows what I remember from the bible without hitting you over the head so much about the bible-ness. But it does it in a, I hesitate to say it because I actually have read very little from the guy, but it really feels like something out of an Alan Moore adaptation. Taking the outrageous elements of well known stories but showing it in a world where we see what probably would have happened. For example, (spoilers ahead!), one of Noah's sons goes out to the Cain- people to find someone to have as wife (he did the maths and concluded that he really wasn't up for banging his mother as the only way to repopulate the earth). But on their way back shegets caught in a bear-trap. Noah finds them as the Cain's are storming forward, water starts falling from the sky so they're kind of on a time- crunch. He grabs his son and leaves the girl. Some part of me goes ""Well, OK. He's going to have a change of heart, come back and just in the nick of time save the girl because he's our hero""Nnnnope. Girl gets trampled to death in no uncertain ways. Now Noah and his son has to live with that decision. And when the drowning actually starts we see Noah and his family sitting there, listening in horror to days of screaming of thousands of terrified voices as humanity is dying out there. Heck, it's even established that the Cain-folk are so big into eating meat that they aren't above catching some of the animals herding towards the ark and ripping its flesh by hand and consuming it raw. It's even implied at one point that one source of meat is human babies. So yes. There's quite some amounts of nightmare-fodder here. He (Noah) is even brought to the point where he finds that he has to kill the newborn babies that are delivered by the girl he took in as his daughter in order to appease the will of the creator. But while it's brutal as hell at times, it never really strays into the torture-porn ways of something like Passion of the Christ. No, everything here seems at least to be motivated. And while I can possibly see why biblical fundamentalists might see problems with the depictions here. I honestly think that it is probably the best bible-film I have ever seen. And come on, a film that depicts the godless people as baby- eating savages must score at least some points in a bible-thumpers hardened heart. ;)So, my final words would be that I really recommend it. But be warned. This isn't at all like the slapsticky happy and colorful ways of something like the Noah-story in The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966). And while it didn't exactly convert me from atheism. I could very well watch it like a bizarre form of anachronistic bronze-age fantasy.Oh, and there are RockBiters in it too. Which was a treat for fans of Neverending Story like myself.",Noah
296,infoalwaysacritic,Curiously Insightful,5,4 May 2016,"Settling into this film, I immediately knew I had to put my Bible to the side before watching what promised to be an exciting narrative based upon a graphic novel, and not scripture. An example would be when the film sets the stage by portraying fallen angels to be generously helping man, at great sacrifice to themselves. The most interesting aspects of the film, however, are the pieces taken from scripture and in curiously insightful ways. Other parts of the film go as far as putting the words of God into the mouth of the villain.Visually, the film works quickly to make an impact with striking use of colour and contrast. The film delivers a lot of beautiful scenes, with an apocalyptic environment contrasted against colourful examples of life and vegetation that make it worth watching in high def. An example of insight comes from the visual depiction of scripture that describes God cursing the ground because of man, and this is shown vividly as characters refer to the world as a dying world, and the perpetual scorched wasteland around them. Another curious piece was the visibility of stars in the sky during the daytime. This is another piece of a pre-flood environment that was a surprising touch by the director. This artful use of imagery is what made the acting, and the story, feel somewhat lacklustre as it did not deliver the same nuance as their environment.The characters are given enough history to make you feel like you know where they are coming from, with some tension provided early on to set the villain of the film against Noah. Though the villain could have used some more characterization before things got to a head, in the end, he seemed more like a picture of a concept than being a distinct character of his own. This concept was again an interesting insight as evil men are portrayed as having a destructive habit of eating meat, in graphic and bloody ways. It wasn't until Genesis 9, after the flood, that men were given permission to eat meat, and so it makes sense that it would be viewed as a perversion of creation to have done so.Methusala is played by Anthony Hopkins, and the brief period of time he is on camera is just enough to make you like him for his quirks. It is Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson who make an impact with their emotional and passionate performances, and they are what carry the film through the rough patches of having no one else likable on screen. There are times when the story gets dark, and really dark, with nowhere to go; and those parts just killed the experience for me, because the explanations just do not live up to the cost.The film provides some insights into some of the lesser-known passages of scripture and in that respect, it proves to be an interesting, though gritty, representation of the story of Noah. At the same time, it is not the story of Noah, but more of a fantasy movie of its own that is pretty depressing and apocalyptic. The interesting dichotomy held my attention at first, and in the end it proved to be just okay.",Noah
297,cat-that-goes-by-himself,Expensive junk,1,11 September 2014,"Frankly I don't care much about biblical tales, but I doubt Noah had such family tantrums as this movie depicts while waiting for the flood to recede. And if he did, I doubt it would be worth showing on a screen.If you remove the eye candy and pointless violence, the movie is just an interminable pretentious bore. Even the expensive cast cannot hide the crass mediocrity of scenario and dialogs.Crowe and his crowd do not even remotely evoke biblical characters. They look more like your average American middle class family faced with a psychopathic killer during a prolongated power outage.Yet another Hollywood movie aiming to maximize return on investment by grinding a potentially acceptable story into predigested junk food topped with pungent special effects and a good splatter of blood.I am just baffled it was actually Aronofsky who directed this piece of expensive junk.

The acting isn't that great, but the director added his own flare and creativity to the story of Noah and his Ark, which I commend him on. It's a hard feat, and the audience must be highly critical as it is a biblical film of great proportions.However, me being an agnostic, I am not overly familiar with the Bible but have seen enough throughout my life to know what the story is about. I get that with each remake of Noah, there has to be differences in order to draw the viewers in, but I found that this story was boring and the only big thing that was added was CGI and some tree-like rock creatures. The acting was not the greatest, and the whole movie had this depressing air around it that didn't make it suitable as a family film. It was darker than the previous renditions of the film, but the core differences between the original stories of Noah's Ark and this one are too much to not notice. As a result, I give it a 6/10 due to its lack of entertainment and in this case, too much unnecessary CGI.",Noah

I watched the movie with the initial aim to support Emma Watson, so I had little expectations for the film. However, the movie did give me quite a few surprises and set me thinking. Noah Russell Crowe as Noah Instead of portraying Noah as a saint, Russell Crowe made him a human, pained and struggling with the thought that he had to carry out the creator's request to ONLY save a pair of each species of all the innocent animals, and this did not include him and his family. It was also interesting how the time lapses between each scene were shown using Noah's hair length (From long to crew cut, and then growing back again) besides the building of the Ark.Emma Watson as Ila Emma did a pretty good job bringing out the role of Ila, a barren girl who miraculously got pregnant, and gave birth to a pair of twin girls. However, it was difficult for me to see her acting out intimate scenes after ten years of watching her grow up as Hermione.Noah's Sons Out of the three sons, acted by Douglas Booth (Shem), Logan Lerman (Ham) and Leo McHugh Carroll (Japheth), only Logan caught my attention (perhaps because I recognize only him). His character here was a huge contrast to Percy Jackson. Here, he portrayed an angsty youth desperate for a wife and family, making his role more distinct as compared to Shem and Japheth.Noah Tubal-Cain Ray Winstone as Tubal Cain Tubal Cain is most probably the type of antagonist the audience would hate, and wish for his death, a blatant man who is willing to do anything to survive. We may hate him for all we care, but I cannot deny that he is the personification of the evil that exists in all of us, the ultimate reason why the Creator wanted to wipe out the human race in the movie.Religious film with little bias Before watching the film, I had wondered if Noah would be a movie with an extremist's view. I was surprised to see that Aronofsky, who interpreted the movie based on the Old Testament, managed to show respect to the religion and engage the audience without hostility and condescension, despite being a non-believer.Beautiful Abstract of the Scripture I was less than impressed, when I saw the transformer-like stone creatures (with the voice of Optimus Prime) appearing in the film. But as time went by, I realized the fallen angels were interpreted in a form where I could hardly fault Aronofsky (Watch the movie to know what I'm talking about!). Who says angels have to take the form of human? This is not a Disney movie after all.Aronofsky was able to express the story of Adam and Eve, the snake and the apple with beautiful CGI artistically and concisely, yet selectively dramatizing lesser-known but significant details from Noah's life, such as his inner struggle with allowing him and his family to survive while having to watch the rest of humankind die, as well as the scene where he fell down, drunk and naked, as his son Ham looked upon him with contempt.A meandering plot While the scenes were majestic and beautiful, there were two points where the plot slowed down, once...read more... http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/04/03/Noah-movie-review/",Noah

For those who know the Noah narrative proper, the film leaves no point, and for those who are not familiar with the original story, this is just confusing. Either way, there is no point of religious edification, nor is there any point of entertainment. This film has not only spoiled the narrative itself, but more so the message which this story has conveyed for centuries.

306,Incendid,How to build an Ark and survive the Beginning of the world,5,29 March 2014,"Ciaran: I went into this film expecting a lot of water and to come out thinking that i just wasted 20 dollars, only one of these expectations happened,and it is obvious which one that is. Anyway, the movie starts out with a silent presentation of how the universe was created, and we hear the awesome soundtrack devised by Clint Mansell. We then arrive in Noah's childhood where he is about to be given the skin of the snake from the garden of Eden by his father, just as he is about to receive it, the decadents of Cain kill Noah's father and take the skin, Noah then runs away. We cut to him as an adult where he teaches his children about the land and how the creator created everything. And so the story progresses and we see Noah have a vision in which God tells him to build an Ark and put two of every animal on it. Noah does this with the help of the fallen angels. Aronofsky uses a montage to follow a stream of water, showing days fly by, before the water reaches a certain point and two doves find the signal and fly to the Ark. Noah hit all the right notes, the casting was great, the chemistry worked, the story was followed just depicted differently for a different audience, the CGI was great, the angles and different film techniques used were pleasing. But the emotion Noah places on the audience is epic, i was disturbed in some scenes and in another the whole audience was saying aw to the happy scenes in the movie, Noah was making the audience think and feel connected to the characters which is what film is all about, this may not have been the safest option for Aronofsky, especially because most bible movies do not seem to work, but Aronofsky seems to have worked the movie correctly. In conclusion, no matter what age you are or what your religion is i recommend Noah, my only advice is Don't Go In With Popcorn, some scenes are disturbing. My Rating: 7/10- NOTE: I highly recommend for Atheists and Christians to go in to the cinema thinking of Noah as an independent story rather than a 'religious promo'. I went and watched this movie as an irreligious person with two Christian buddies who both thought the film was decent.",Noah

It is very controversial; many people will like it as a movie but some people will not like it because they are not an atheist.Personally I believe in God, but I also am a movie addict, and a huge fan of Harry Potter. First of all I think it must be possible to like what you want without other saying it can't because...Also I went to this film because it was an interesting theme to see on screen. I didn't watch it so I could say : ""Oh this didn't happen in the bible"". I can't agree more with the Director to add these giants in the film. As a filmmaker part of your job is that audience will see the whole film. It must continually be interesting. And that was the reason of the giants and it was a great choice.I think the storyline was well written there were good relationships between those characters and there was done a great job on telling the story. Which is something very important in not only a movie but certainly in a movie like this. The audience must get this connection this special moment when they watch a film. Looking at the storyline it worked. I liked the moments of the snake and the apple Etc. they solved that ""problem"" on a good way.Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly has done a wonderful performance in this film. The whole casting really did their best to deliver a job that would deliver a sort of truth to the story. They respected the story and it was great to see their amazing performance.I rate this film 6/10 because of the great performance of the actors.",Noah
308,jacabiya,Garbage,1,22 October 2016,"Does anyone in this film, except Tubal-cain,realize that if Noah knew of the upcoming flood and the need to build an ark that big, and since all the animals went to the ark, and the deluge actually occurs and wipes out humanity just as Noah said, maybe he knew what he was talking about, maybe God was actually revealing his plan to him? Seemingly Noah's family believed this at first and liked the idea of been the only surviving men, but in the time it took to build the ark they somehow forgot, or thought Noah misunderstood the last part of the message, and began behaving as if God wanted something different. This change apparently occurred because Noah changed his opinion regarding what God wanted and they did not like this change, the children had grown into adolescents, and Ham wanted a companion, and later at the Ark all wanted Ila's baby be born. Is this a comment on human nature?, because if it is, it is extremely lame: what is stated is that men doubt God even after overwhelming evidence of His existence and his will. My opinion is based strictly on what is presented in the film, and not on my beliefs. Aronofsky clearly thought the Bible story of Noah lacked drama to be commercially successful with teenagers, and therefore added the silly plots about Ham's tantrums since he wanted a woman real bad, Methuselah's God-like powers to allow Ila have children, her sudden impulse to get pregnant and the upcoming deluge, and wife and son confronting Noah because of this. His wife, his sons, Matusaleh, do they doubt Noah? Really? Didn't they see the Watchers talking, admiring and helping Noah build the ark, defending it, and finally beaming up to the heavens? And still they believe Noah is wrong, and that what he is doing is not God's will? Is Methuselah defying God? Is he senile, or just playing a joke on God? Is Ham really willing to have his father killed by Tubal-cain? All because they believe Noah is misreading God. What if they are wrong? Are they all willing to risk eternal damnation because of this? (As a matter of fact, there's no mention of Hell) Do they believe God is wrong, of that they know better, or that God will have a change of heart? Really, you minuscule, insignificant, stupid creatures? Not once does Naameh refers to God's will when she confronts Noah towards the end of the film: since she is a woman and a mother she, of course, Hollywood-style, must defend her sons and Ila irrationally, even against God's will. I've never seen such a self-centered clueless bunch. And we are supposed to root for them? And at the end they knew more than Noah about what God really, really wanted? What a pair of cojones this guy Aronofsky has! And at the end Noah concludes he was wrong about God wanting to end humankind, Ila explains to him why he was wrong, Noah looks at the sky and seemingly gets an OK from God, or something? Really?",Noah
309,bdwilneralex,visually impressive but FLAT,4,1 June 2014,"I fear that ""Noah"" is going to start a very deleterious trend. We have been told by the media that ""Biblical"" movies are once again becoming popular, but there's nothing Biblical about this.My first question is why Ents from Lord of the Rings had to be introduced (here, they take the form of ""rock people"" or ""watchers"" or some such: we are even told in the opening credits that the Lord created the Watchers).My second question is why Methuselah is still alive.My third question is why Biblical people are dressed like Vikings in heavy woollen tunics with leather vests, boots, and stockings.Further, why was Shem's wife barren until Methuselah touched her (I was unaware that normal people could impart the gift of fertility in the Judeo-Christian world view), and why were there no wives for Ham and Japheth on the boat, and what was that wacko Tubalcain (yet another anachronistic reference) doing aboard the boat? I'll confess that I didn't stay for the last thirty minutes of this 132-minute jazz.If you want to make ""Noah,"" then make ""Noah,"" not this sacrilegious trash albeit visually stunning.",Noah
310,jwsanfrancisco,"Noah ---excerpts taken from movie/book reviews, musical lyrics......",10,21 April 2014,"....And he said, What hast thou done?the voice of thy brother's bloodCrieth unto me from the ground. --Gen.4:10Prologue to the historical ""non-fiction novel"", CAIN AT GETTYSBURG (Ralph Peters@2012), a semi-fictional work far superior to KILLER ANGELS( Michael Shaara@1975). You cannot slog through this book w/o referring to the hourly detailed maps showing opposing forces approaching ground zero.( like watching a cat scan of a cancer tumor).The star of the novel is a 3 horse cow town somewhere in central Pennsylvania, a small speedbump,actually a massive pothole on the road to perdition for the South. Over 600,000+ gave their lives in this deluge of death(U.S.Civil war,1861-1865, resulting in the descendants of slaves to be set free).With the exception of Meade & stoic GEneral Robert E.Lee, most of the book characters are fictional ""composites"" of actual historical figures, including grunt soldiers & commissioned officers on both sides. Unlike the biblical dialogue of NOAH,the fictional ""composite"" dialogue sounds like very authentic Civil war vernacular of soldiers facing imminent death on the soils of Pennsylvania.This is also the running theme/prologue to NOAH, the movie.These are not fictional composites, but an actual murder prefacing actual historical events depicted in the movie, given the Hollywood biblical epic treatment(""....preposterous, but endearing epic adventure movie."").....Cain slew Abel, but lies o God about it. Was the ""mark"" of Cain a warning to others not to harm Cain,or was the ""curse"" of Cain to make all his descendants black?

The star of this biblical fable, based on historical fact, is Russell Crowe, but how did he get there in the first place? ""It appears less & less biblical, and more & more like 'GLADIATOR in the rain', driven to madness by the voices in his head."" I was almost driven to madness myself by the fantastical special effects, including the CGI ""Noah's Ark"", not so much a boat carrying all sorts of ""beasts with four furry paws""(OF MONSTERS & MEN-dirty paws{3:58} ), but a box-like wooden building lying on its side. STOP",Noah
311,filmfanperspective,Noah as a superhero (**1/2),5,5 May 2015,"It is important to note that I have no grounds to critique the historical accuracy or inaccuracy of a Bible story. Suffice to say, I'm familiar enough with the idea of the ark, Noah, animals furry and slimy, and scripture that I can at least have a frame of reference. The thought of an actual Hollywood production of this story seems a bit preposterous- with varying viewpoints, faith-based opinions, and a lack of pure evidence to reference, a representation of such a fantastical story would have to be taken for what it is, conjecture.The question, then, is whether or not ""Noah"" accomplishes the mission to be a competent, consistent film, conjecture be damned- and my answer is a soft 'no'. It has the ambition of a blockbuster, but none of the joy. It has the tenacity to be provocative, but lacks the conviction required for deeper meaning. It is thoughtful, but not wholly religious. It strives for authenticity, then allows for silliness. All of these inconsistencies might generally doom a film, but ""Noah"" isn't a complete failure- simply an incomplete and confusing undertaking. It's a blockbuster film from an independent filmmaker, and it just doesn't work.Most know the story, but I digress. Noah (Crowe, in a performance you'd likely expect), per the Old Testament, was an obedient man. So obedient, in fact, that God chose him as the deliverer of all innocent creatures- for He so loved people that He decided to kill 99.9% of us and 'cleanse' the Earth. A task so grandiose would call for a steadfast servant, and Noah was indeed that man. A direct descendant of Seth, one of Adam and Eve's children, Noah possessed the pure-of-heart genealogy that made him ideal for God's task, and set him apart from others in his time. The film depicts him as a decent but sad man, weary of outsiders (descendants of Cain and Abel) that seem to be driven simply by chaos.We understand through the narrative that Noah is part of the tenth generation of man, a population that had clearly lost touch with their creator. This film also tells us that despite our youth as a species, we were apparently quite advanced- we could manufacture vast amounts of weaponry, grasp the nuances of hand-to-hand combat, speak with distinguished English accents, and give birth in soggy, animal- infested environments with little to no consequence (or medicine). We also walked the Earth in the presence of fallen angels, who apparently became prehistoric transformers as part of their plight. A select few of us apparently had God-like powers as well, which begs the question- why believe in a creator when you don't need one?Therein lies the problem with ""Noah""- the film simply cannot commit. It begins bombastically, then depicts humanity as primitive and savage. Then it introduces mysticism. Then Noah and his family are helpless, but then the next moment they have God to bankroll their actions. Then humans are incapable of behaving humanely, thus 'proving' why they deserved death, I suppose. Then they are inspired by a single menacing guy (Winstone) to intricately organize a massive assault on Noah's ark and provide an unnecessary antagonist. Furthermore, the very moment Noah can prove his obedience beyond a shadow of a doubt, to truly affect the future of the human race as he was tasked to do- he cannot, for he is weak. It's the same type of weakness that millions were punished for. The moment disproves the notion that Noah was indeed special, for how can the chosen messenger be the chosen messenger if he disobeys a direct order? We'll never know. I'd say the filmmakers were making a statement about faith, free will, or human nature, but the rest of the film is jumbled just enough that I cannot say for sure either way.As a technical achievement, however, ""Noah"" has few rivals. The ark, for one, is a thing to behold. For that matter, most effects in this film, especially those involved with the flood, are stunning. When the rains come, and the water flows, it is swift and frenzied to the point where I became immediately sold that nothing land-based could survive. As the ark becomes a mobile vessel, the film's most powerful moment, enhanced by CGI, takes place. A 'mound' of people, crawling over each other to escape the rising waters,writhes in fear, creating one of the more terrifying scenes in recent memory. Imagining how Noah and his family must have felt hearing the carnage outside was humbling. If the rest of the film carried the same weight as that scene, we'd have something. Director Darren Aronofsky (""Black Swan"") understands that weight- in fact, his ""Requiem For A Dream"" was so heavy that I cannot bear to see it again. He seemed to understand the need for a steady theme and tone, which makes this film even more confusing.I'm aware that I may be attempting to interpret this film too literally, but please do not misunderstand- I gather that the film is asking us to take the story on faith, and perhaps take something away from it to bolster said faith. That doesn't excuse its' faults, nor will I ignore its' merits. Despite being an inconsistent film lacking a true identity, I found myself appreciating a variety of moments. I simply wanted the film to embrace something, to be that movie that tries to interpret the language of the time, the fighting style of the time, the brutal, primitive nature of the first round of humans. ""Noah"" is certainly not a complete failure. Rather, it is a fine case study on how a filmmaker with the movie-making soul of an independent created a studio-appeasing blockbuster so he can continue making movies with an independent soul.",Noah
312,Hassan_Scarborough,Awful. Not even worth a dollar rental.,1,1 August 2014,"When I first saw the poster advertising this movie I thought it was going to be bad. Russell Crowe usually equals Gladiator. Plus his casting is just wrong for this part. But, I thought, for a rental, why not watch it.Well...It was worst than I thought. Absolutely the worst adaptation I have seen so far. It was Gladiator meets Lord of the Rings-in a very bad way.Sure the cast is great but even great actors can be miscast. The story deviates from the source to much. Talk about taking liberties. This movie takes way too many liberties. The CGI was awful. It almost looked like a cheap made for television movie instead of an epic motion picture.This isn't worth watching even for a dollar",Noah

On the basis of being a ""so bad it's good"" movie, this one provides unintentional humor that makes it worth sitting through the whole mess.First, don't expect a coherent story, secular or biblical. Perhaps this could be called a psychotic story, if such a classification exists. There are bizarre interpretations of parts of the original Noah story, some that take make you wonder what the writers were smoking. One set of creatures reminded me of muppet characters from a Starwars prequel. This movie stinks worse than the animals on the Ark must have smelled.Of course, the plot, what little of it that can be deciphered, goes off in hundreds of dead-end directions. The human characters are emo, brainless, and cartoonish. People who have been hand-picked to survive a global holocaust, and repopulate the Earth, probably would have shown more sense than these people do. Look for some lingo that is oozing with political correctness. This is the kind of movie that would have fit in perfectly as one of the MST3K ""experiments."" Thumbs down for this movie if you want to see a story about Noah, or even a run-of-the-mill adventure flick. However, thumbs up go to this movie if you love to laugh at crummy movies.",Noah

It was a bit lengthy and slow in areas but not too bad. The actors all did a fantastic job and the cinematography, as well as the special effects were very well done. I was pleased to see a big crowd rather than the usual few patrons on a Friday afternoon. This attendance signifies to me a thirst for Biblical knowledge and a relationship with God. There was nothing offensive to me other than a bit of gore, to which I turned my head for a few seconds. The entire audience, including children, were quiet and attentive; all stayed till the end and there was even some applause. I hope more films of this genre are forthcoming.",Noah
315,roguecritic42,One of the most significant spiritual movies of our age,8,27 July 2016,"This story of Noah is unique because it draws of various religious traditions: Muslims, Christians, and Jews.It is not a propaganda piece, but more so, a spiritual story pointing towards a One God and Creator of All mankind. It doesn't draw ONLY from the Old Testament (As most Christians might expect). There are plot points only found in the Quran, The Jewish Apocrypha, and other Jewish literature. The movie draws from all the historic literature about Noah and recreates a more complete story.There are underlying morals that are based on our various religions, and the movie takes creative artistic liberties to fill in the gaps that engages the audience with a beautiful message of one of the most well known stories in history. It is unique. It is not a cheesy PBS special that is word for word from the Christian Old Testament. No, this story offers so much more. The Jewish and Christian scriptures speak about the Nephilim (the offspring of fallen angels), but we never get a clear picture from literature of what they might have looked like, so this movie dazzles us with an artistic picture of what they could have looked like. Imagine a saint, that is much like you. As crazy as that sounds, that is the artistic approach this movie emphasizes. A normal man who only stands righteous because of following his heart and conscience and the teaching passed down to him from his father. He was not your stereotypical religious man following a strict code of commands from an ancient book. Instead, Noah is more relatable to the modern living saints that walk among us. They are not perfect people, but truly desire to follow God. The CGI is amazing, the story is epic, and the movie is beautifully well done to make an old story come to life in a new way. And the list of actors tell you the quality of acting involved in the making of the film.",Noah

It has something new, something bold perhaps. I don't read a true word in the Bible, but I see something profound, something evolutionary in the interpretation made in this film. Well done by the writers!Perhaps the Bible is not about God, but about us?I like the idea!",Noah

Only one version: Noah is a prophet of God, who got the task to build an ark, rescued the animals, with his family, and let the rest of the world drowned. That's it.So far it doesn't conflicted with this movie version of Noah. The other bonus characters are pure entertainment. Why the fuss to compare it with any story that various religion has about Noah? Every religion claims that their version is always right.Well, I'm glad I'm not stuck with any version, which is why I give this movie a solid 8/10. The directing was good, the actors especially the oldies were great, I wasn't really impressed by Ila and Shem's performances. But they were better than Ham.And I love the imagination, how Aronofsky depicted every single aspect of this movie. Felt really touched with the romantic longing the fallen angels had with their Creator.I might want to watch this movie again. So yeah, I recommend it for people with no chain to the stories that they were taught in their religion.

Last night, Cheryl and I went to see Noah and we were startled when about 1/2 way through the movie the building started to shake. At first, you want to think that the movie next door is having a particularly violent scene or maybe some stuff is blowing up and the building is shaking a bit. But then, it kind of started rolling and moving back and forth (as CA buildings are designed to do in these quakes). Lots of folks were exclaiming ""I'm getting scared!"" Nobody freaked out, thankfully, nobody bolted for the exits. But some did leave afterwards, in the middle of the movie.They missed the end of Noah. Which really wasn't much better than the beginning I suppose. It was about a 7/10 on my scale. Decent, but nothing outstanding. About the level of the typical animated movie, a comic book version of something ripped off from the Bible. It was a lot less biblical than the last movie we saw (Son of God). I was surprised by the lack of Biblical structure, and then at the end, they throw in this one obscure event involving Noah getting drunk, and I just had to almost laugh.It's entertaining, that's about all. They used evil as a key element, and original sin was prominent. But there was just too much fantastic outside stuff to even believe. The script line strays far from the Bible in some very key areas, leading me to believe the script writers may have glanced at the Bible maybe once or twice. Not that it's that familiar to many people, but there was just so much weirdness I found myself just sitting there saying ""Is the Bible really that hard to believe or understand that they had to make up so much of the rest of this?"" The Earthquake in the middle made it really memorable. Kudos to God for bringing off a total mind-blowing experience in the middle of a movie about His book!",Noah

My excitement quickly first turned to disbelief, then to appalled, then to annoyance, then to irritation, then to anger, then to utter disgusted.I totally get the need to 'add' to the story, but what this film added was a total joke. This was not entertaining, it was down right boring. I kept wishing I was watching this on cd so I could fast forward thru the movie. Like other reviews state the Rock watchers looked like something from transformers. Noah was portrayed as a mixed mma fighter, psychopath. The setting looked like something from Mad Max. The movie completely screwed up the story from the Bible. God layer down such a devastating judgement because everyone in the WHOLE world was wicked. This movie showed some crazy people come out of no where. Where were the cities? Noah ' sons were grown and had wives. They could have shown an ancient evil civilization, with sorcery, witchcraft, with giants and other creatures but instead most of set was nothing but dirt and rocks. This movie's only redeeming part are the closing credits.

It's entertaining enough and the special effects are pretty good, but I have to give it a low rating because it pretends to be a retelling of the biblical tale and many who do not know or read the bible will think it is. Call me paranoid, but I often fear that's the agenda. Beyond the name Noah, a flood, and the transport of animals, this is a mythological tale based on Hollywood writers' imagination nothing more. Whether you are religious or not, you cannot adapt a move from biblical text with this much creative license and still call it Noah. Enjoy this movie as a long lost Greek mythological tale or a transformers movie where the ancient transformers help out a local human to build a boat and save humanity, but don't even consider this biblical in anyway.",Noah

Not only can Noah be praised for its terrific design, it is also very cleverly made, as religious themes are not forced upon the audience, but are rather more subtle, with greater emphasis being placed upon the characters, who are well-developed and come across as very compelling. Overall the film's star-studded cast offers some very strong performances, but it is the few scenes shared by Russell Crowe and Emma Watson that are particularly captivating and worth specific praise. Although Noah is considered to be an epic, the running time could have been shorter as the pacing is often poor, resulting in a film that captures one's imagination, yet comes across as lacking intensity and vigor.",Noah
324,timlittle,The Bible meets Game of Thrones,3,23 March 2019,"I'm not overly familiar with the Bible story but I'm pretty sure it wasn't this long and bloated.
Over acted mostly, badly acted at others this looong fantasy drama sees Crowe adopt his best English accent for the (presumably) Middle Eastern character and his rather irritating immediate family, to escape the epic flood......with the assistance of some rock creatures straight out of the 60's Dr. Who special effects department.
Yes it really is that ludicrous. Tedious dialogue and endless meaningful stares are supposed to remind us of the epic nature of the struggle
but just serve to want the viewer yearn to see the ark (which has all the hydro dynamic properties of a house brick) dash against the nearest rock.Crowe looks like he struggles to get up the ladder, having obviously fed himself up for the journey....whilst the rest of the 'crew' could obviously do with tucking into some of the stock.
The cast do well only insofar as they manage not to look as embarrassed as they clearly should be....both at the dialogue and their own excruciating performances.
Emily Watson is as unconvincing as ever, dropping tears as swiftly as you could drop a hat.
Blah blah - on it goes. A colossal raft packed full of creatures that make hardly any sound and don't create any droppings or waste and never seem to need feeding. Perhaps Crowe ate them all.

325,-628,The Bible re-written in a truly awful movie,2,10 July 2016,"The Bible tells the story of the purging of the world to rid it of evil. The good man Noah is instructed by God to build an ark, which will allow Noah, his wife, their 3 sons and their wives to survive, taking with them 2 of each species of animal.In their wisdom, screenwriters Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel set out not so much to distort this story but to re-write it. They dispense with the notion that sons Ham and Japeth had wives and replace them on the ark with an evil descendant-king of Cain, so that evil finds its way onto the ark. This allows for an epic battle to the death between Noah and the evil descendant-king towards the film's climax. Noah is portrayed not as a good man but as a warrior, a mass-murderer and as a cruel and ruthless man intent on committing murder in the name of ""the Creator"". The result is a poor man's ""Gladiator on Water"".Given that ""the Creator"" wants to preserve ""good"" on the ark, it is a strange twist of fate that Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins), for all intents and purposes a better man than Noah, is not allowed onto the ark but rather perishes in a violent storm along with all the ""evil"" men. Obviously his goodness is not required for the final epic battle.The interpretation of ""good"" is quite a muddle for most of the movie. Noah and his middle son Ham have many shortcomings when it comes to being ""good"" men. Noah is willing to kill innocent people - as well as a multitude of ""bad"" people - while Ham is beset by jealousy and revenge to the point of willing to become an accomplice to murder. I found it difficult to feel compassion for either.The movie also included the introduction of rock monsters who come to Noah's aid, taking the movie squarely into the horror genre. Perhaps fantasy is a better word, because even though they start off as potentially threatening creatures, they eventually come to Noah's aid - and even end up killing most of the film's population before the flood can destroy them.I watched the entire movie in the mistaken belief that things would improve as it went along. They didn't - and at the end I was left with the feeling that I was glad that I waited until the movie had come to TV because I would have felt cheated paying to see it at a cinema.",Noah
326,Mitiori,Entertaining Mess,5,5 April 2014,"Wasn't very excited to see this movie for a variety of reasons. Not that I didn't want to see this small, yet popular Bible story come to life; and it wasn't the casting of Russell Crowe who despite his off-screen antics always does a good job. I think it was the director and the seemingly long-time that it took to bring to screen that had me hesitant. Turns out I was right to be leery. It was entertaining, but ultimately a real let down. A lot of wasted potential. I'm sure someone will do it better.How was it entertaining? I alternately laughed, was moved to tears, covered my ears and closed my eyes in horror, and was writing Kosher jokes in my head (really, with a kid named Ham who wasn't, um, quite Kosher they really wrote themselves). The acting was solid, but the haphazard script and the poorly used visual effects watered down the story (wasn't meant as a pun, but again, the jokes just write themselves for this movie). Then there was the fact that the movie didn't know what it was supposed to be - spiritual teaching, PETA cautionary tale, action movie, battle movie, Neverending Story + Galaxy Quest (hello rock monsters) Harry Potter (nothing to do with Emma Watson) or a drama? Most of the time I felt it was a comedy. That's what made it a mess. SPOILER - The entire plot device of having the Cain-king hide on the ship for 9 months with the support of the son and no one noticing was ridiculous. And, really, there was hardly any point. If there was one, it was handled very ham-handed (see, writes themselves). There were a lot of visual effects, but they were not really put to good use. I could have done with a lot less bird butts.

327,MetalMania88,An atrocity,1,4 June 2020,"This movie has everything you need to make a terrible film, bad acting, bad directing, bad writing and bad music I can fully understand why people hate this pile junk and I probably hate it the most the charachters were unlikeable especially Noah all he was doing was letting the remaining humans die and only let his family and the animals on the ark but he is doing unfair things to his family he was acting like a serial killer he was even planning to kill his newborn daughters but thankfully he didn't still I hated everything that was done here it was supposed to be based on the book wich was a billion miles better than this crapfest it's bad it's horrendous and it's really really dumb you can't even tell much of what is going on because the acting is so terrible they once act like they are serious but then change there mood randomlythe film looks like a combination of movies made by great directors Michael bay, Peter Jackson and Roland emmerich, viewers think it was directed by them because it has elements from 2012, the lord of the rings and transformers it may look like it but personally I think this movie is so bad that is doesnt look like either of the directors Michael bay, Roland emmerich or Peter Jackson would make it. And it wasn't it was directed by Darren aronofsky whom I have never ever been a big fan of because his movies are very confusing and pretentious and the only movies I liked from him were black swan and the wrestler the other movies he made ( pi, requiem for a dream, the fountain) all crap and this one is as far as I'm concerned much worse than those pieces of crap and the worst part about the movie is aronofsky's directing it was really bad and another thing I really hate is how he put rock monsters in the movie really why would he do that there were no rock monsters in the Bible, stupid huh I don't know how they got the idea of putting them in the movie but it was a big mistake and this movie disrespects the book and is an insult to the Bible this is one ugly mess of a movie and it is a disgrace to the art of filmmaking and also an insult to cinema.it doesn't even deserve to exist and it was no wonder why it got banned in certain countries not only that but I think it should be banned worldwide not be shown anywhere the story is unrealistic and incoherent the acting was really bad, aronofsky's directing was really bad and the cinematography was really bad this film deserved razzie nominations in all of the categories especially worst director( aronofsky) worst screenplay (aronofsky, Handel) and worst screen combo ( the rock monsters) this is a large atrocity to cinema, a huge waste of russell Crowe's talent, the worst movie of 2014 and it is also the new plan 9 from outer spaceThis film also has an ending song that is bad and the song was mercy is by patti Smith I hated it and she did a poor job with singing the song for this film it was so depressingly bad she sung it like she was nervous of dying.and to the other cast members of the film to Logan lerman, to Jennifer connolly, to Douglas booth, to ray winstone, to emma watson and to the actors who voiced the ugly abominable rock monsters, nick nolte, Frank langella, Mark margollis and Kevin Durand shame on all of you, you have all done your roles poorly I surely hope all of the discs for this abomination get incinerated and burned they should throw away all the dvds and blu rays for this nasty film like I said it must not be shown by anyone, avoid it at all costs",Noah

She is a brilliant actress and portrays her role of Ila to perfection. Watching her in action is a joy like no other even when her eyebrows raise weirdly when she tries to make her point. The direction wasn't up to the mark and the story line okay-ish. Overall, this is a serious movie with a lot of blood, gore and emotions. Definitely not for the faint hearted and definitely a movie that leaves you thinking for days to come. Bottom line - Not a 'must watch'. but definitely a 'could watch'.",Noah

I knew it wouldn't be a holier than thou take on the scant biblical narrative, but I had hoped it would deal with a mythological approach to the ontological question. It could have been a marvelous expression of the dual nature of what it means to be human. Instead, we get a brooding film full of unintentional comedy and ridiculous special effects that would be much more at home in a transformers movie. It left me wondering what a good cast like this was doing in such a weak attempt to . . . to do what exactly? The animals boarding the ark sequences made me feel embarrassed to be in the theater.Read the original story. It's shorter but a whole lot better.",Noah

We know what's going to happen before it happens, because we've seen it over and over and over again in movie after movie.It's always amazing how the characters, living on bare subsistence in the wilderness, manage to wear make-up, have nice haircuts, and stay healthy and beautiful.I know it's a movie, but a touch of realism would be good.All that said, if you don't mind the same grind over again, this movie on Blu-Ray on a Saturday night with some good snacks and drink can be okeydokey entertainment.

This story strays from the Biblical story and facts. This is a bad because any future version of the Flood brought to the big screen may have to top the variations shown here by being even more varied. Thus pushing even more away from the true source material. On the plus side, the movie does have good performances, great special effects, good production, and an interesting take on the Ark. Being a good Christian, gave it a 1 star due to not covering the Biblical story faithfully. But it does stand okay on it's own as a fantasy story of Noah.

335,pablo2896,Arnofsky makes it rain,8,15 April 2014,"Noah review It's weird that I've heard many people saying that it rained on the day they watched Noah and it got even weirder when the same happened to me. My theory is Arnofsky made a pact with god to make it rain while his movie is screening to get us viewers in the mood. If that is true, it may have worked because I kinda liked this movie! The movie is obviously based around the biblical story of Noah, who builds an arch to save the animals and the good from a great flood send by god as a catastrophe to cleanse the world. Arnofsky uses the source material to build his own mythology and world which is an aspect I respect. That is why many aspects created or ""added"" by Arnofsky don't feel out of place. This adds tension to the movie as you cannot predict what the characters will do next as Noah is not the cheerful old dude that stuck a thousand animals in a boat that we pictured from what we had heard. This story is a lot darker. The characters are darker, especially Noah whose conviction to what he feels he is meant to do takes him into some VERY scary places. Logan Lerman's character is a conflicted one too and has a nice arch written for him. The majority of these actors do a good job, even Jennifer Connelly who I thought was gonna be a generic character has his shining moments. I can't tell you a lot about Emma Watson because holy hell she is beautiful and it got me a little distracted and the dude who bangs her is pretty forgettable as I can't remember his name and I don't even feel like looking it up. The one that really shone for me was Iron Man's director, Jon Favreau. Nah I'm kidding it's Ray Winstone, but Jesus, does he look like Jon Favreau! Ray Winston made the villain as imposing and badass as the character got and I congratulate him on that. Hopkins got a few scenes in this movie and the two of them were charming. He even got his berry! Aside from the darker parts of this movie, of which there are some that may surprise you and maybe stick in your brain for a few days, this movie is absolutely epic! EPIC, in capitals. From them moments the prophecy is shown you know something big is coming. But when the douchey villain is introduced and the movie starts going from the arch to the villain's army camp back and forth it starts picking up on the epicness and it all climaxes when the rain drops start hitting that bald Russel Crowes head! That battle sequence was one well done action set-piece. All the rock giants are swinging legions of bad guys across the screen... it is awesome! As seen in the battle sequences, this movie is very well filmed and directed. It even has an evolution montage which used an awesome technique that made it unique.This movie goes a little bit further than an epic summer/spring movie and I give it props for it. It isn't Arnofsky's best and it won't leave you burning your brain while you decode it afterward and it is weirdly edited in some scenes, but it sure is a little bit better than a very good time at the movies.I give Noah an 8 out of 10.I do have a question that bothered me throughout the movie: If the rock angel committed suicide why did it go to heaven?? I'll let Arnofsky go on this one for that Mila Kunis + Natalie Portman scene he gifted us with.",Noah
336,sreethered,Fountain all over again......,9,28 March 2014,"Darren Aronofsky built a reputation in world cinema with his brave ventures like Requiem for a dream, Black swan and Wrestler. Among these, there was a movie named Fountain, which dealt with the concepts of life and death. The movie was a box-office failure but nowadays considered as an underrated classic. When I watched Noah, it reminded me the fate of Fountain. Similar to Fountain, Noah also deals with the issue of our existence in this world. Aronofsky chose a popular biblical relic for the purpose.The director's intention was so much innovative that it deserved a much more focused approach. Noah is flawed, no doubt about it, but it would've been a better movie. It deserves multiple watches for grasping the whole idea that Aronofsky forwards. As a director, Aronofsky excels like his any other movie. With cool visuals, striking montages and a mind bending plot, Aronofsky gives everything he got. The problem that haunts with Noah is the presentation. Paramount swears that they have given the complete creative control to the director, but it's bit hard to believe. If it was meant to deal with the inner struggles of Noah, they should have portrayed that instead of flying doves. Seriously, I'm fed up with those goggles. You have to wait for an hour to the real movie to begin, while you are dealing with the 3D gimmicks. When the movie actually started to deal with the real script, when it started to became serious, it ended so soon that you will feel like 'what???'. Noah is a movie with a strong philosophical platform. The Eden sin and the story of Cain and Abel are not just myths, but are the very lives of human race. The forbidden fruit represents the violence and greed which lurks in every human being. Tubal-Caine becomes the snake to Ham, when he offers the flesh of beast to him(Spoiler, whatever). This movie is food for thoughts. Go watch it by yourselves and if you feel the same way, let's call it deja vu. As a final note, if you are going to movies to see some action and to crack some popcorn, wait for next week's Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But if you are a serious moviegoer, you should watch this one.......",Noah

The acting is atrocious, the dialogue is appalling, the bastardisation of the tale unforgivable, and the simple truth is the writer must be assumedly so ashamed they probably didn't mind giving up the credit.Transformers. Yes, they put transformers in a bible tale. Whichever development idiot did this deserves state execution, not just industry pariahdom. It's a *stunning* new depth of dumb. That meeting must have been a crack-pipe fest.The apocalyptic Hunger Games-style world is back. Only this time, they don't land on Mount Ararat; the dreadful Emma Watson gets to try to look sincere on the beach where they probably filmed ""Lost"".Animals all get special magic gas to sleep.Noah is a child-killing religious fanatic who is very concerned about the environment, like a good West Coast liberal voter Hindu who's just really a bit irretrievably tormented by his own self-loathing and inner conflict. Or an American Indian.God is now pretentiously and sanctimoniously referred to as ""the creator"", by execs who can't quite stomach calling him God. How awkward.Noah's grandfather has special magic powers, like Gandalf. And lives on a magic mountain.All the old, worst God tropes: man justifying himself, moral relativism masked as ""truthy"" rhetorical Instagram ""wisdom"", praying to an empty sky, isn't love all that matters even though we are violent murderers etc.All Judeo-Christian references, gone. Presumably not to turn off atheist viewers who would never watch it in the first place, or to be politically correct (or something).it just goes on in how embarrassingly stupid it is: nauseating, superficial nonsense from superficial people. Reading it on paper must have been painful, and i have no idea how anyone kept a straight face at any stage of it.This is what happens when screenwriters go so militant on the rules they make up in order to patronise each other with. There needs to be an ""enemy"" to create ""obstacles""; whilst the character has to go through a ""struggle"" to find a ""motivation"" on their ""journey"" and be ""likeable"". It needs ""tension"" and a circus-style build-up. These are things you emphasise if you have no story. ""Stories"" that apparently ""need"" this template nonsense shouldn't be made into films, full-stop. Yet again it's meddling studio people thinking they need to make the story ""better"" after their 44th 3rd-grade read of ""Save the Cat"" or the ""Hero's Journey"". The kind of people who make your favorite rug ""better"" by urinating all over it.You'll end up wishing you were the one drowned or sacrificially murdered.

338,screenotes,Did J.R.R Tolkien write the Bible?,6,1 February 2019,"In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth. It's unclear from the original text as to when he created giant rock monsters but fast forward to 2014 and Darren Aronofski released the film, Noah. While God took 7 days to create the World, Aronofski's reboot of God's epic took 14 years (screenplay to release) and cost $130 million. We can only speculate over God's budget for the original but given his work was antediluvian, we can assume it must have been on a relative shoestring.Perhaps a direct comparison is not fair. While Darrenofski is one of the few modern Directors to be consistently given a sizeable budget to fulfil a singular vision, God had complete autonomy (and omnipotence).So comparisons aside, does Darrenofski's flick sink or float? For all the epic scale, special effects and aforementioned giant rock monsters of the first act, Noah is most engaging when it develops into a story of a family rent asunder by a father's will to do what he believes is right.It is this second act, set wholly within the ark in which all supporting actors shine in their portrayals of various family members torn between ultimate sacrifice and the protection of innocence. Crowe's performance is adept as the conflicted-come murderous father and far more rewarding for me than the well-trodden fight scenes of Act 1.But as engaging as the second act is, it will remain for me the only memorable element of a film which is hindered more than helped by its epic scale. Perhaps both auteurs could have benefitted from reigning in their vision slightly, after all God did create Michael Bay.",Noah

The scenes were palatable, pretty good action, but this bore little resemblance if any to Noah, the prophet, the man of God.. I mean, c'mon.. not once did they show him praying and fasting and his personal relationship with God, not once did they show him offering burnt offerings and sacrifices, oh, but they made sure to include water breakage of the girl going into labor, as if this carried some historical significance..

341,bland-kevin67,Say No to Noah!,1,4 June 2015,I am not sure what pleasure the writer director may have gotten by spending millions of dollars to produce a movie from a poem he wrote when he was 9 years old. The movie was a total waste of time and it was an affront to the Holy Bible and several other religious books. I don't know why would someone wish to insult so many people who grew up on one of the few stories told by every ancient tribe in the world. The story was not too bad but it is a shame they had to soil a biblical hero in the process. The acting was good and the special effect were special. Russell Crowe did as much as he could with the role. Ray Winstone also stood out. I just wish they could have stuck with the story of old.,Noah
342,jacqueestorozynski,Computer disaster game for teens,6,4 October 2014,"I like Russell Crowe and think he can always bring something to a movie even if the script isn't very good. My God (it is a biblical epic) he had to work hard in this film. It was all special effects and no story. The story from the bible is quite well known so why they had to dress it up like an episode of Lord of the Rings I am not sure. Russell made no attempt to hide his Ozzie/New Zealand accent and as for Ray Winstone whenever he said 'WIV' I thought I was watching Eastenders. I am constantly amazed that he gets cast in Hollywood movies. When Emma Watson turned up we were waiting for some Harry Potter magic to save the world. We'd forgotten what we were watching, it could have been Transformers as these giant stone men kept striding about. When we had the big build up for Noah interpreting Gods' will that only the people on the ark could survive ( in one scene some animals were killed- so that was one species that would have died out) he suddenly became all cuddly and warm. I wonder if he saw the script before he signed up.",Noah
343,tom-43722,I liked it,8,12 August 2015,"I wouldn't call it the greatest film I've ever seen but it was a great interpretation of Noah's Ark. Although I've never really paid too much attention to the Bible, I have enough knowledge to recognize the importance of the doves and the flashbacks of the snake and the apple. What struck me about this film was that Noah was a very flawed man, who abandoned an innocent girl and even planned to kill his grandchildren. If he had gone through with the murder of his two granddaughters, he would have been just as bad, or worse, than many of the people who drowned in the flood. Noah was misinterpreting God's signs, such as the barren Ila's miraculous conception of the twins, which nearly resulted in him destroying mankind. Russell Crowe isn't among my favourite actors but he successfully showed that even men chosen by the Creator are just as flawed as the rest of mankind. It also shows that sin is unavoidable. I dare say that one could interpret it as saying that even God himself is flawed.This film gives people a lot to think about and I interpreted Noah's grandfather Methusela as an incarnation of God, which would explain his insanely long life (Noah looked like he was in his late forties or early fifties and Methusela was two generations ahead of him) and his ability to give barren Ila a child. Furthermore Anthony Hopkins seemed almost happy when the flood came, which I interpreted as God being satisfied with his work on Earth and when his physical form died in the flood, he could return to heaven. What I like most about that was that it's left to the viewers interpretation rather than being outright stated whether Methusela was actually God or not.It was also nice the see the lovely Emma Watson outside Harry Potter and trying a very different kind of role. Harry Potter was the start of her career but by no means the end of it and she still has a promising future ahead of her.The stone golem's were a bit odd for this kind of movie but I didn't mind their presence and actually quite liked Semyaza, so it's a shame that he died.One slightly disturbing thing about the ending is that if Noah and his family were the very last humans alive on Earth, that means that Ila's daughters would be forced to have incestuous relationships in order to continue humanity.",Noah
344,ipekmine,Visual feast and quality acting: Noah does not disappoint!,8,6 April 2014,"After months and months of anticipation and having witnessed the harsh, often prejudiced opinions on Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Noah, I went to the movie theater with extreme interest & curiosity on top of the excitement of seeing a new Russell Crowe movie.In my humble opinion, it is not possible to be disappointed by Noah provided that one goes to see it with an open mind instead of judging its historical/biblical accuracy or analyzing the story from a solely religious standpoint. Regardless of which religion or belief one belongs to, if any at all, Noah helps surface complex questions and invites the movie-goer to think about human nature, creation, and even evolution. It delivers the story of the great flood from a unique perspective, enriched with spectacular cinematography and a brilliant cast each of whom add their own touch to the massive production.In order to avoid spoilers, I will not go into detail but I'll say this much: the brutal criticism Noah received by now (even before it was ever screened) has been unfair, and I sincerely hope that more and more people choose to see and interpret the film on their own terms instead of sticking to dogmatic approaches or narrow-minded opinions imposed by others. The blockbuster by no means disrespects any religion or belief, and most certainly highlights an integrative message without marginalizing any former or current community.I've seen the movie with my parents and brother, a group of four with an age range from 25 to 60, consisting of two non-practicing Muslims and two people of faith who are not associated with any organized religion. Each of us had a lot to say when we left the cinema, and it led to a very deep, valuable discussion about mankind, faith, and spirituality. Speaking of the post-Noah discussion, on behalf of my family, I'd like to thank Aronofsky for casting Russell Crowe as Noah, and hats off to Mr. Crowe for his fantastic performance –he's one of the few actors who never disappoint!Last, but not least, I (yet) haven't seen the non-3D version of Noah (because almost all movie theaters screen it in 3D where I currently live), but I really liked the ""art"" aspect of the motion picture; the quality did reflect the underlying body of work, turning several scenes into a ""visual feast"" if I may say so. CGI was brilliant, scenery was beyond beautiful, and the soundtrack was a good match to the overall ""epic"" feeling of the movie.All in all, Noah's been worth the wait (for me) and I absolutely loved the visual experience as well as the artistic way of Aronofsky's story- telling, and it's been –as usual– a big pleasure to watch the incredibly talented Russell Crowe on big screen. I'm not saying Noah is a flawless film (which movie is, anyway?) but I dare say it meets the high expectations and I most certainly recommend it!",Noah

Russell Crowe gives a great performance as Noah. The rest of the cast does a very good job, as well. Everything looked really awesome. The film did have some pacing issues and I was bored at times. Other than that it was pretty good. Not the Noah story I was accustom to, but I didn't have many problems with this version.A visual spectacle challenging believers to look at their faith in a new way (did not Christ do the same?) and challenging nonbelievers with an epic of struggling humanity amidst a flood of divine mystery. It's filled with temptation, vicious sin, our origin's simplicity, our heart's complexity, new life, flickering mercy, family issues, the limits of zealousness, not shying from the evil but neither the rainbow that finally emerges after the perilous storm.",Noah
348,YasheshJ,"Noah is Aronofsky's attempt to hybrid his brand of comparatively complex film-making with a mainstream, commercial style.",8,31 March 2014,"In hindsight, ""Noah"" was a 'queer adaptation' of a well-known, straightforward apocalypse story—loaded with heftiness and ostensible profundity, yet enjoyable.Some critics would just go ahead and criticize Aronofsky for this pseudo-intelligent film, while some would appreciate his attempt. And, of course, there will be obvious objections from some religious sects. Takes some courage to do something of this sort and serve it to the masses; fortunately, the result at box office seems quite satisfactory.Noah is definitely not the best Aronofsky, but a good initiative to introduce the masses to another artistic style of film-making. Striking imagery aided by Aronofsky's trademark hip-hop montage, impressive background research (a director is allowed some creative leeway), and a strong performance from Russell Crowe, Emma Watson, add to the film.Side note: Theater I usually visit is always packed to capacity for 'Anderson/Lin/Bay' brand of films (that's obviously what most go for when seeking sheer entertainment) and almost empty for, say, 'Lynch/Malick/ Bergman' brand of films.Noah, with its rousing trailers, brought in the masses alright and got them cerebrating too. This group of school/college going students was the perfect example. They started out like ""what the hell is this!"" (on NOT finding the fully fledged action-adventure the trailers promised). By the end, though, group was more than satisfied and appreciated/debated the little bit of symbolism that was there in film.7.5/10",Noah
349,PanamaVeggie,Some Cool Visuals But Lacking in Depth,6,11 August 2014,"Just watched this on Pay-Per-View having missed a chance to see in theaters (dithered over whether or not to see it due to wildly mixed reviews). It was visually engaging enough to keep me watching till the end but as the credits began to roll, I found myself feeling dissatisfied. Some of the scenery and shots featuring animals were really cool, I found myself wishing for more (that is, more time spent on animals...and a closer look at different species as imagined by the creators of this film).Ray Winstone is a distinguished actor but I found his portrayal at times creepy, at times laughable, overall weak (how much of this was due to direction and/or other factors...not sure, when it comes to this film I didn't get a sense either way). Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly impressed me, I got a sense of quiet strength from their characters.Russell Crowe, also one of my favorite actors (I thought his Robin Hood was masterful, a fresh new take), disappointed. Without giving anything away, there were some parts of this film that called for a more dramatic narrative...his timing and (at times) rushed speech took away from the grandeur of what was meant to be an epic film. You find yourself wishing he would deliver certain lines a bit more theatrically, like David Wenham in 300 or one of the greats of classic film (Charlton Heston, perhaps).I didn't realize when I started watching that Anthony Hopkins was also in the film. When he popped up on screen I laughed and thought: 'Of course...can't make an epic film without Anthony Hopkins!' Probably just me but it seemed a bit tired as far as casting goes. I might have enjoyed it more on the big screen but don't regret watching at home on my TV. Bottom line, entertaining enough to watch...just a bit of a let-down.",Noah
350,dikaea,Not so bad....but you have to open your mind and read between the lines....,6,24 July 2014,"A lot of people have trashed this movie..... well it is totally understandable if you watch it expecting it to be an adaptation -even a loose one- of the biblical story.It is mostly allegoric and it has used the story of Noah to tell a story about present times and the human condition in general.The acting is average, as is all of the rest, but the juice of the movie is not the acting but what it is trying to say and make people who are not very religious or very atheistic think.It is not a religious movie but it has a philosophic approach. Yes, it could have been better but it is not that bad.",Noah
351,keith-w8888,prediluvian depression worse than post apocalypse,2,7 April 2014,"It's all very well for Russell Crowe to complain that people criticise this movie without having seem it, but I've seen it and the best thing about this movie was Emma Watson pretending to cry. OK, this is one of perhaps the more interesting myths of creation, but the biblical version varies from others in making man the guilty party but this twisted, bleak ugliness really takes it too far. I think it might appeal to the bible belt of America, to stir up a bit more hatred of sinners, but otherwise I can't see the intended audience for this. It's like taking the worst of Cormac Mcarthy, Leonard Cohen and Edward Munk and combining their talents for finding dark clouds surrounding every silver lining and putting it into one miserable work of exceptional ugliness. In the beginning was the screenplay and the Lord Crowe passed over the face of the screenplay and decreed that it was good. Yeah, for gravitas he added the Hopkins but added also the Winston to take away the gravitas of Hopkins in double measure. The Lord Crowe said ""Let there be cockney accent and posh little English accent in equal measure"" and yeah, let the Lord Crowe get all the awesome lines such that the cinema going public see the magnificence of the Crowe in full measure and then let the Lord Crowe be badass until the very end when he shall yield allow the human race a second chance, for we are not worthy of his greatness.",Noah
352,jkm0119,Very disappointing,1,5 May 2014,"This is supposedly based on the Bible but leaves the Bible out of everything. Basically this is a movie that tries to lead those who have never read the Bible into a world that never was. If you like fiction over reality and like falsehood over truth, this movie is for you. So the effects may be good but I am disappointed with the actors who played in this as they should have had more respect for the Bible. I know this is a day of bashing the Bible and Hollywood always hated everything about God or Jesus but this movie is so absurd that it makes the beliefs of the myths of the Greeks and Romans part of the Bible.

I'm not religious so the CGI rock monsters and other things not in the bible didn't bother me much, in fact they were probably the highlight of this terrible movie. The fact is, nothing happens and it happens slowly with no explanation. If this was supposed to be 'intense and arty' then it failed miserably.

354,missybusty,Much worse than I could imagine,1,31 July 2014,This movie proves one thing - Anthony Hopkins will do anything for money. It also proves Darren Aronofsky is a very weird dude. But you probably already knew that if you have seen any of his other movies. When you think of Noah and the story from the Bible what comes to mind immediately is a large Ark and animals entering the Ark 2 X 2. That story is no where to be found in Darren Aronofsky's movie. What you have is a sci-fi family psycho drama which seems like it was written by L. Ron Hubbard. There are these strange rock people which I guess were angels at one time & now are being punished. This movie is a punishment in itself.,Noah

The film is also about the Great Prophet of Noah but in film Noah is the villain and What this film is made against the Noah and also want to destroy is image. After all the film suck it is the waste of time and wrong historical fact and the film is not that promising like the trailer show it is Piece of **** so don't watch this film and if your friend have seen this film he will also say that it is waste of time. it give us no feel of the film",Noah

I can complain that ALL of Noah's sons really had wives -- or about Methuselah's flame sword, magical powers, possession of the ""Eden seed"" (whatever that is), and the fact that HE DID NOT PERISH IN THE FLOOD -- or the evil dude's (who didn't really kill Noah's dad, but did in the movie) bazooka... yes... a friggin' bazooka that took out a stone giant!!! OR that the evil dude (who didn't really kill Noah's dad, but did in the movie) making it into the Ark just so Hollyweird can have their predictable climatic ending (oy vey). All of that is complete rubbish... but the stone giants... LOL!!!! The friggin' stone giants (or ""fallen angels"") that helped build and protect the Ark, was the most ridiculous thing I have seen in a movie in a very long time. I about peed myself when I saw the stone giant playing with the kids after Noah comes back from Methuselah's mountain!!! Obviously writers Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel just got done watching the stone giant scene in the Hobbit and thought it would be cool to throw a bunch of them into the story of Noah! How quaint. Finally, I believe Darren and Ari's greatest transgression was to hippie Noah into believing that he was only building the Ark to save the animals, and that ALL mankind, including his family, must die. But I expect nothing less when you let a couple members of PETA rewrite the Bible.I gave the movie a 1 higher than 1 solely for the special FX.",Noah
358,runner-15,"Epic fiction film ""INSPIRED"" by the story of Noah.",6,28 March 2014,"Noah reviewed...Be forewarned if you read this there are MAJOR spoilers.Again.. MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!I went and seen Noah this evening and was blown away by the visuals and cinematography.I found the story interesting and loved the inclusion of the Watchers from the Book of Enoch. I did not really like the appearance of the Watchers, but the book of Enoch never describers them so I will give a pass there. Get a copy of the book of Enoch and read it.Although the major aspects of the film follows the Biblical account, there were quite a bit of the film that was obviously entirely from the mind of the writers. This was to be expected given turning a short story such as Noah into a 2 hour movie. For example the mental agony that Noah experiences in the movie is never mentioned in the Bible but I can easily see how being the last family on Earth and the responsibility God cast on the shoulders of Noah could make him a little unbalanced. Also in the movie Noah thinks his job is to save the animals, not mankind. Noah spends much of the movie expecting to be the last family on earth. It is not until the very end that Noah accepts that God wants mankind to survive also.I will normally give Biblical movies a pass for adding stuff or even leaving out stuff as long as nothing added or removed results in a direct contradiction of the Bible. So I can accept that we have no idea what was really going on in Noah's mind. One thing we can be absolutely sure of is that not every detail of every story is included in the Bible. Simply by reading the four Gospels we can see that each Gospel presents a slightly different view and things that are included in John may not appear in Matthew and vice versa.That being said, contradictions, is where this film missed the mark. There are two major and one minor plot point that DIRECTLY contradict the story of Noah in the Book of Genesis.The first and most glaring discrepancy in the movie is that only one of Noah's sons has a wife on the ark. The other two are wifeless. This is set up as a major motivation for Ham's actions during and after the flood. Yes, Noah is shown drunk and naked in the cave after the flood. Don't worry it is presented in a way to as to not offend the viewers. The omission of Ham and Japheth's wives is not complete though, Shem's wife is found to be pregnant in the early days of the flood and she eventually gives birth to twin girls just as the ark lands on mount Ararat. Although it is not specifically stated, it seems obvious to me that these twin girls are destined to eventually become the wives of Ham and Japheth. So, since Shem's wife was pregnant before she came on the ark you could say that the wives of Ham and Japheth were on the ark the whole time. That being said the absence of wives for Ham and Japheth was the most egregious error in the movie in my opinion.The second major annoyance is the stowaway. Yes the writers saw fit to write a subplot involving a stowaway on the ark. This sub plot directly interacts with Ham's actions during and after the flood. Could there have been a stowaway? We don't know for sure but I highly doubt it. I thought the stowaway subplot was totally unnecessary. No, the stowaway does not survive in the end.And my last and complaint is the very subtle way the story was I don't want to use the word ""twisted"" I would say the story was subtlety ""adjusted "" to include an environmental message. I understand that we need to take care of this planet as much as the next guy but I am tired of Hollywood slapping me in the face with an environmental message every time it gets a chance. The remake of ""The day the Earth Stood Still"" was a prime example of a great story ruined by turning it into a Environmental crusade. And Noah suffers from this to a small extent. Overall I would have given the movie 8 out of 10 rating but the 3 contradictions and the overt environmentalism cost it points. Overall I gave the film 6 out of 10 stars. Finally it is for the most part a very enjoyable movie that lost points for its Biblical inaccuracy. Now after viewing the film do I recommend viewing this film? Yes BUT you should go in with the expectation that this is fiction film ""INSPIRED"" by the story of Noah and the flood in the Bible. If you go in with the expectation of a Biblically authentic movie you will be disappointed. If however you go in expecting to see a epic movie somewhat ""loosely "" based on the story of Noah then by all means do.",Noah
359,lakeshore-98711,Where were the animals?,5,14 September 2020,"Noah was watchable, loved the fallem angels ... but no animals, they were mysteriously put to sleep, for the length of the flood, what a stupid concept, and one comment 3/4 way through movie that animals have woken up and eating eating each other? even that oneliner wasnt followed up. I was totally disappointed in no animals, and glad I didnt show my grandchildren this movie, as I would have built it up based on seeing pairs of creatures being saved from the flood..

I grew up with the story of Noah and was pretty certain this, yet ANOTHER ""biblically inspired"" movie, was going to fall flat on its face (honestly - I rolled my eyes at the first trailer). Having finally decided to see it, I found it entertaining and visually beautiful.Finally someone (Aronofsky) unapologetically offers a fantasy story that borrows little more than the basics from the ancient original. It differs to the point where I was drawn in and happily ignorant of what was going to happen next. I found it enjoyable, and to those who have qualms with it's ""accuracy"", please remember this is art and entertainment - not a pulpit.The landscapes and ""Watchers"" were probably my favorites - beautifully realized and captured. I thought Crowe and Connelly were a good pair, reminiscent of their partnership in ""A Beautiful Mind"" (he's strong, silent and burdened; she's kind and long-suffering). I would say Emma Watson was a stand-out for me - I was impressed with her performance, and I think to say more would give plot points away.Last thought: Some of the depictions of evil (why the flood is needed/happens) might not be appropriate for children. I know opinions/thresholds vary, but I was surprised at the PG-13 rating.Enjoy.",Noah
363,armin-durakovic,It's good,7,5 August 2014,"First, I have to say that I am a big fan of Darren Aronofsky. Every movie that he directed is a masterpiece for itself (my personal opinion). He may be not that productive, since he made 6 movies in 20 years of his career, but he is thorough. And by thorough, I mean that he goes in every detail to get the watchers point of view closer to the psychological impacts and the development of the characters in his movies. He takes all your attention and puts it, as much subjective as possible, into the mind of the main character. That's why I love him. He makes you feel, what the character feels. He soaks You inside the role. He is comparable and can be associated to Dostojevski, regarding the character psychology in his works. With Noah, he didn't disappointed me in that case. He developed the story very smooth, in exact balance that is required for a movie like this. The plot moves slow from the beginning and accelerates at the end. Maybe the movie is a little bit to long, he could put the story in two separated movies and develop the plot a little bit better with the ending sequences, but it is like it is now. In the second half of the movie it becomes very tense and dramatic. The Noah's emotions, hopes, expectations and actions give you lot of tension and thrill to rely on. The soundtrack is good and moving. Actors gave it a solid performance, there's no doubt about that. Darren himself, however, admitted in an interview that he changed the story a little bit from its origins. Everybody who read the Old testament will be aware of that. He twisted the story a bit and put some different elements of the story for the mainstream audition to picture the story better in the today's world (like the watchers for example). For me, it goes to much into mainstream fantasy, and that's the thing that I don't like in Noah. It may be that it's better for the most people. It is easier to consume the movie and more money is made, but it is a religious movie that tells the story from Old testament and I think that it should be kept in these boundaries.",Noah
364,markleachsa-1,Neither Fish Nor Foul,4,6 July 2014,"I didn't approach this movie as a believer or non-believer. To me, religion is the ignorance of the ancients passed on in a massive centuries-long game of Chinese whispers. That people live and die by the end result of this delusion is both fascinating and horrifying. The thing is, every religion is the (usually oral) history of tribes dressed up to make themselves God's favourites. And almost every religion in the world has a Flood mythology, as in - ice age ends and a lot of places flood. God did it! Pass it on! But that has nothing whatsoever to do with this film - despite it being purportedly about the great Flood of the Christian Bible. It is a mish-mash of make-believe that has nothing to do with sacred texts, and dashes hither and thither like a child with a sugar overdose at a party looking for someone with just one more cupcake. The actors battle valiantly but in vain with the sudden switches from preaching to sentiment to nastiness to extracts from 300 and the Life of Pi. At times it is set way in the past - as would be expected - but then you realise that it's actually set in the future ... no, it's the past ... wait, it certainly is supposed to look like the future ... wait... Noah as a film goes nowhere and actually does very little along the way, while Noah as a character - does pretty much the same. However, Russel Crowe does his best to disguise this by switching from manic to passive/aggressive and back at the drop of a ""cut!"" I will spare the blushes of the rest of the cast by not mentioning their names, apart from saying ""You know who you are! And you should have known better!"" I have no problem with the apparently controversial Fallen Angels - they are no stranger than anything else in this movie. They look like the rock monster that fought Tim Allen in Galaxy Quest, which was quite cute, and move like the Ents in Lord of the Rings ... and sci-fi, fantasy and religion are the same thing anyway, so why not? Is it a religious movie - yes, but not very good at it in trying to be for every religion - even to the point of never naming the ""Supreme Being"" God and sticking with ""The Creator"", in case other religions with different names for it get the hump. Is it sci-fi or fantasy - yes, but not very good at that either (and the cgi really sucks.) Is it an environmental message - yes, although pretty weak apart from the traditional 'Man is evil! Man should die!"" theme. Is it an action movie - yes - but unexpectedly not very much actually happens. Is it a documentary demonstrating how an ark could have been constructed - yes, but not really, as this ark would have sunk immediately, in the same way that an oil drum and a few pieces of bamboo tied together and laughingly called a raft sinks when a dozen boy scout clamber on. Is it inspirational finishing with a message of hope - no. So why do I give it a four? Well, the actors did try their best (except Anthony Hopkins who smirked quite a bit and allowed quite a broad welsh accent to creep into his ancient Aramaic voice.) And anything with Emma Watson is worth a watch.",Noah
365,WheelzFourReelz,"It may look beautiful, but the content of Noah makes for an ugly, ugly film.",4,29 March 2014,"When I first heard about this movie I was very concerned. It certainly had potential to be great, but I didn't know how they would execute it. The last thing I wanted this movie to be was an environmental message. Well, do you know what this movie is? An environmental message! Because Hollywood! This movie is based on the Bible story of God flooding the earth to save man. He does this and trusts Noah by building an ark and repopulating the world with people and life. That's the Bible's alliteration. The movie is quite a bit different. I will start out with positives. The acting is very well done. Everyone does a great job really transforming into their roles. Russell Crowe does well, Emma Watson does well, Logan Herman does well, and Jennifer Connelly was absolutely fantastic. She was definitely the shining star in this movie. The cinematography was absolutely fantastic. It was beautiful with all the landscape and water and stuff. How the movie was shot was absolutely masterful. It does feel like it's disjointed at times from switching from the normal shots to the montage shots, but it was still awesome. The cinematography was easily the best part of the movie. The action scenes were cool. They were intense and just thrilling to watch. You really feel the impact of every blow. And at some points, these moments are downright disturbing. It's something that's hard to explain, but if you've seen this movie, you know why. Despite all this, there are some things that really got under my skin. First off, I feel like this movie was a little too slow. There's a lot in this movie, and there's just moments when you wish that something interesting will happen. I don't mind a movie being slow, but when I start fidgeting in my seat, that's a problem. I also feel like this movie is a little too long. They could've cut about twenty minutes out of it and it would be perfect length. No movie should every have you keep thinking, ""Is the movie almost over yet?"" And then there's the obvious one. This movie drifts far apart from the source material of the Bible. Now, I am religious, so it's probably no surprise that this would bug me, but hear me out. I am perfectly fine if a movie has absolutely no religious aspects from a religious story. That doesn't bother. What does bother me is how this movie handles it. This movie treats Christians as the bad guys. Noah has to do things that aren't necessarily the most pure or nicest things ever, and this movie plays it like its God's fault. This made me mad. Like I said earlier in the review, this movie has a serious environmental message. This shouldn't bother me, really, it shouldn't, but here's the thing. This is the story of Noah we're talking about. Noah from the Bible. The story from the Bible states that God is wiping out the earth because man is wicked and once the flood stops, they will be born again and learn from what they've done. God flooded the earth to save man and he kept the animals because he liked them. The movie states that God flooded the earth because ""nature"" and ""the animals"" needed to be saved from all the evil people that eat meat because every single bad guy in this movie eats meat. This is the exact opposite of what the Bible story is. Not only that, but it's just not true. Sure, the environment is important, but not as important as the life of a human being. It's messages like this that really anger me. Overall, I do not think this is a bad movie. In fact, it's quite good depending on your viewpoint. It's how the movie handles its own source material that really makes me not like it. If you enjoy this movie, that's fine. It's just not for me.",Noah
366,aka-45316,"Honestly, this is...THE VERY WORST ADAPTION OF A BIBLICAL STORY I'VE EVER SEEN!",1,23 February 2020,"The first time I saw this movie was a long time ago with my family, and we hate it so much. I hated it enough that I left in the middle of it, so many thoughts about it running through my mind. Then, I saw it again for the 2nd time in preparation for making my review on this film, and when I did...my thoughts on why I disliked it became clearer.The story and direction of the film was pretty much a dump every step of the way. It was not only completely unfaithful to the actual story, but the dark, dramatic, and depressing tone it had was so overwhelming it made things FAR from fun. It was too overbalanced from all three of those descriptions. Not only that, but the film seemed to lean too much on environmentalist values, especially because of the emphasis of animal value over humans.For those who think that the action sequences are the most sluggish and uneventful ever seen in a film, I very much agree. Even though the characters were obviously fighting, they lacked energy and liveliness.The CGI that was used in this movie was also something that I found to be cheesy. Much more than ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", if I may add. Every effect that was used in this film had so many obvious signs that they were done by computer, right down to the flood waters.On the subject of the acting, I definitely don't doubt the abilities of its cast. They were okay. However, their talents and abilities were completely wasted by the film's script and direction, like they were as drowned as the wicked people in the flood. It doesn't help that the dialogue they were given for their characters was as forgettable as a forgotten memory, that's for sure.The character development overall didn't even signify much of a great growth for each character, particularly because it wasn't clear on if the commitment of Noah and his family was diminished or not. It was almost even like saying we should throw our faith and trust in the Lord away like garbage.In conclusion, this film is an absolute disaster. Not only due to the waste of talent, but for having too much Hollywood and too little Bible.",Noah

Except of course the part of pushing post-modernism's view on ""creation"" that we still evolved. #weaksauce There are mention of ""giants"" or ""large land creatures"" in the Bible, some even say that is where Goliath'd descendants came from....so to make them fallen angles is not a far fetch and actually Bibically accurate.

370,RuthlessGoat,"Noah is a mess, Evangelical and Atheist alike should hate it",3,11 April 2014,"Seriously, I looked forward to this movie with glee, but that anticipation was quickly snuffed out in the first 15 minutes of the film. No comfort could be taken in the knowledge that Aronofsky had taken additional liberties with the already laughably ridiculous account that was in Genesis. I read the Biblical verses before I left just to make sure that I would not be disappointed, but there was no salvation or solace in this miserable movie. Let's see, Mad Psychopathic Max (Noah) teams up with Rock Transformers to do the will of a even more demented god concept and orchestrate the end of the world. Hey, humankind deserves it for eating the apple and then raping the earth. This was such a wooden, hamfisted mess that I was continuously pinched by my date for mocking the movie, out loud all throughout. Aronofsky, you are dead to me for this atrocity, an 138 minute long gulag, with no redemption.",Noah
371,edgereviews,Beautiful visuals let down by some weak writing...,8,23 April 2014,"The main reason I was looking forward to Noah was because of its director, Darren Aronofsky. Aronofsky has directed two movies which I consider to be among the best ever made, and those two movies are 'Black Swan' and 'Requiem For A Dream'. When you look at the rest of his excellent filmography with the likes of 'The Fountain' and 'Pi', it's easy to see why he's considered one of the best directors in the world today. After all, he's never made a bad movie. However, I definitely had my reservations with 'Noah', it's the first time Aronofsky has been given a big budget and with a biblical story, things could turn very bad and controversial very easily. Thankfully, Noah isn't a bad movie, although it is probably Aronofsky's weakest.First things first; this is not a straight up bible adaptation. It never promised it would be, and it doesn't need to be. If you're one of the people who won't see this movie or will immediately disregard it due to it's inaccuracy (to an already fictional story) then you should pull that giant stick out of your a** and stop being so goddamn pretentious. This movie is somewhat well written, and the changes it makes to the story all feel merited and necessary to Aronofsky's vision. Some of the stuff is pretty strange, but it adds to the visceral experience and makes it all the more enjoyable . A lot of the dialogue is pretty bad, and the characters aren't particularly well written, as even though they all get some good emotional scenes, we never really learn who the characters are. We learn nothing outside of Noah's mission to help God, we are given a vision of him that shows he is devoted to God and is often tormented over it, but other than that we learn very little about the character's personality.Although the characters are fairly weak, the actors do an excellent job with the material. Russell Crowe is excellent in the title role, he surprisingly brings a great feel of menace to the role. Ray Winstone is good, but at points it feels like his acting is too over the top. Jennifer Connelly doesn't really have much to do in the first half of the movie other than a few good scenes with Noah, but she really shines in the movie's second half. I was surprised to find that Emma Watson steals the show, as her character was the one I cared the most for and she had some great emotional moments that really showcased her excellent acting. I've never liked Logan Lerman, and he's tolerable in the movie but I really didn't like the character, and felt like it was a role that many characters could have also done and done it better as well.But Noah's shining quality is it's directing and cinematography, which is absolutely phenomenal. There are a few shots in the movie that involve stopmotion-like time lapse sequences, and these sequences are mindblowingly good. The film uses lots of silhouettes which are beautiful, and there are some incredible juxtaposed shots as well. I was surprised at how good the VFX are, as after seeing them in the trailer I thought they looked quite cartoony but in the movie they look great. The set and costume designs are excellent as well, and I wasn't expecting this movie (being PG-13) to feature some of the more mature themes which it does. The first half definitely isn't as interesting as the second half, but when the movie picks up it really does pick up. The film does bring up a lot of interesting points, but I feel like there was probably a lot more moralistic and philosophical content that the studios made Aronofsky cut.Noah isn't the best movie ever, but visually; it's absolutely incredible. The cinematography is amazing and everything in this film looks beautiful. It's worth seeing for the visuals alone, as it's a visceral and fascinating experience.",Noah
372,tariq-hossenbux,More Environmentalist than Religious,7,11 May 2014,"I came into this movie without any foreknowledge of how the story would be presented so I was quite surprised that it turned out to be a movie about environmentalism rather than religious sin or anything like that. On the contrary while the movie does highlight what is good about religion, at the end Russel Crowe's Noah goes into a state that warns of the dangers of religious fundamentalism and what such people are capable of doing. All the same I think this film has a good chance of reaching those who need to get the message about climate change and animal rights the most. Noah presents us with an earth that is dying and will be flooded. Just like some scientists predict that the ice caps may melt and flood coastal areas. Just as in our world, Noah's world has naysayers as well. The film asks us to consider what a good person is and why bad people act the way they do. With the level of senseless violence that modern society is plagued by these are certainly valid questions. Russel Crowe does a job of playing the sober Noah who is tasked with doing a job for God rescuing the innocent animals. When he finally does display an outburst of emotion it is all the more dramatic because he is so steady throughout the earlier portions of the movie and leaves a lasting impression with us when we leave the theatre. My only complaint is that the film runs a little long drawing down.",Noah
373,karagoraymond,"Updating well known stories, good idea or bad ?",6,18 March 2015,"A mixture between a good CGI film and Hollywood elements! For better or worse that's up to the viewer to see. Personally, though I do not find the film to be a great adaptation, there are some very impressive features about the film.Russell Crowe was fantastic as Noah, what I liked about it (which was just as much to do with the writing as Crowe's performance) was the morale dilemma that this man was forced to suffer. You can clearly see that though he thinks he his doing the right thing, Noah is forced to make some very tough decisions such as potentially killing his own grandchildren. The rest of Noah's family (Watson, Connelly etc.) they were all wonderful. Another strong aspect of the film where some of the awesome angles and shots that Aronofsky got of the landscape as well as the CGI.However, where the film fell short was in some of the Hollywood Clichés and strange adaptations. For example, though I am a fan of Ray Winstone I do not believe that he was right for the part of Tubal-Cain, his cockney mannerisms just hindered me from seeing a character, all I saw was Ray Winstone! I could have seen Liam Neeson, Gerard Butler or Brendan Gleeson pulling of the role better. Also the use of the ""watchers"" put me off, both in terms of their design and the fact that they did not contribute hugely to the story and I feel they could have been written out and the film could still have been as affective, if not more.Overall, I did enjoy Noah, despite its flaws and it's not for everyone. I'm glad I saw it and will probably see it again.",Noah
374,miruleyall,Interesting and sets out what the director envisioned,8,29 March 2014,"I was only recently made aware that Aronofsky had trouble getting his original directors cut through the studio's meddling hands.This is not one of those movies that needs additional footage to make it better or the need to wait for a extended/directors cut or any other sort of edition.Length wise it feels perfect clocking in at just under 3 hours.It comes as the director intended and even though the movie in itself is fairly formulaic in parts this really helps it stand on its own in terms of artistic integrity, something that is taken for granted nowadays. Now onto the actual movie.Quite a hard one to judge, almost hit or miss, i for one liked it and something clicked with me both on a philosophical and visual metaphorical level but with that being said in short IF you liked Darrens previous movies, especially the fountain your going to like/love this.Lets talk about the best part of the movie...The visuals, cinematography and almost art house style of presentation.From the mind blowing almost VCR fast forward like for the lack of a better word visual/cgi montages this movie is almost one of a kind, hitting 2001 a space odyssey sort of vein and sticking with it relentlessly.The story is very self explanatory and considering its origins the screenplay gets about as much as wound could and would expect out of such a classic tale.Acting is very VERY good in most parts especially Jennifer who gets effortlessly upstaged by Russel Crowe who i think personally his delivered his best acting to date, in stark contrast to Les Miserables which goes without saying was not his best work but i blame that mainly on miscasting... Anyhow now on to the only bad part of the movie.Emma Watson, sorry i have to say it as a amateur actor i can safely say she has no range and either goes from flat twilight style line reading boring dialogue delivery to screaming overacting and or just blank staring, no effort made in part in regards to accent either.If your a Emma Watson fan you probably wont mind but she was much better suited to Harry Potter and Teenager/Younger people movies.Before i wrap this up i just have to mention the sound design, musical score and costume design was fantastic, CGI on some of the animals was a little uneven but a lot better than most but nowhere near the likes of Life of Pi.Overall/TLDR +Visuals +Direction very smooth effortless +3 Hours go by VERY quickly +Gorgeous set design +Russle Crowe +Connely +Sound +Script -Emma Watson -Needs more watchers =8/10",Noah

What would happen if Noah was American? ... and if at the days of Noah they used to wear Marines suites, Jackets and boots and if there were creatures like Transformers (yeah ... I can't believe how stupid this idea is) on Earth ...The same usual Hollywood clichés in the recent 5 years ... the American dad is trying to raise the American family and protect it ... the dream American mother who has no character at all but simply to follow her husband ... and the - of course - the American child who is eager to disobey his father (luckily Noah had no girls, otherwise we would have witnessed the famous ""I hate you daddy scene"").The entire story could be easily told in 15-30 minutes short movie, and it would still be terribly boring ... yet the director for some reason decided to make us suffer more and created endless mega boring scenes, where people just set, speak a word ... then silence falls for a minute ... then another boring word ... then someone looks to the sky for another minute ... you know what I am talking about ... cheap boring scenes.The graphical effects were very low budget, I saw second class computer games with way better graphical elements ... apart from the sea scenes, the graphics were class D digital effects ...One question that I could not find an answer to, How on earth was the director able to convince Hopkins to have a role in this terrible movie??????",Noah
376,nanccakes,Not the same storyline...,3,28 March 2014,"""Noah"" is not the same in this film. I thought it would stay true, because why bother taking a story from the Bible and then changing it? I was quite excited to see this but it was just OK... It has some whacky things in it...rock people (Watchers) and why in the world does that dog creature from the beginning have scales like a reptile? I was confused. I think the only thing they actually stayed true to was the names, the arc building, the flood, and new life. Oh, and I don't think that they had steel fireplaces that far back in time (it was in the arc). And why did their pants (did they even have pants back then?) look like they were made out of jean material?Now, with all that being said, if I were to completely block out the fact that this is supposed to be a based off a Biblical story, the movie was OK. Didn't really like Logan Lerman in it. Was a little slow and odd.",Noah
377,xylophone59,Gruelling,3,16 June 2014,Too many dark brooding scenes. There was little relief. An unconvincing Bible story was not made more convincing by the video game style giants. The ark looked too small. Too much agonizing over the procreation later. It didn't work for me in fact it bored the hell out of me. I can't stand Russel Crowe- he always looks constipated; but to be truthful he did act well in this- a difficult part. The original allegory is unconvincing and so was this attempt at something great that looked like over reaching cinematically. I want to be entertained or challenged intellectually. For me it did neither. With all the tidal waves the inside of the wooden ship looked pretty dry. I don't know. For me it didn't work. The best thing is there were no guns and ridiculous gun fights that wreck most movies these days. Still this welcome relief did not save the movie.,Noah

379,ace_nair,Didn't work for me,4,27 July 2014,"Noah (2014) Director: Darren AronofskyConsidering that the Noah's Ark story is a fairly popular one and concise in its narration, I was quite interested in what Aronofsky was going to spin.Honestly, this movie didn't work for me. The amount of artistic license taken is plenty and the movie pretty much ended up being a fairy tale. The Watchers (fallen angels who didn't figure in any Noah Ark story till date), the tyranny of Tubal-Cain (never reference him in any other Noah Ark story) and the absence of the wives of Ham and Japheth (as per the accepted various ancient versions of this biblical story where 8 humans traveled the Ark) really didn't work for me. The casting was pretty good. Crowe, Connelly, Winstone Hopkins and Watson were top notch. The son's of Noah were too young – Logan Lerman from the Percy movie is miscast here and Douglas Booth as Shem was baffling. With all the liberties Aronofsky was taking I was rooting for them to die in the movie.Good special effects were the saving grace of this movie and overall the movie is over-rated. If you haven't watched it, then save your time for something else.Rating: 4 on 10",Noah
380,chuckienoland,"Stick to your genre, Aronofsky.",1,29 July 2014,"This film could have been great, but this director tried to do whatever the production company wanted and also put his own sacrilegious spin on a timeless story from the Bible. Russell Crowe is one more bad film away from Mel Gibson status. CGI wasn't great and I wouldn't be surprised if producers ended up losing money on this film. Hopefully, Ridley Scott can rescue Bible stories and the damage done by this terrible 'film'. The supporting cast was the bed part of the film. The kid from perks of being a wallflower, pulls out another great supporting role. Jennifer Connelly might have earned some props towards an acting award but Russell Crowe is just gross in this film. Overacting at it's finest. Guess the script and directing didn't help.",Noah
381,pmakauloski2312,"If you have an open mind, this is a brilliant piece of cinema",8,26 June 2015,"I can understand why some religious people will not like it because it is not based on the bible exactly. I've never read the bible, i just wanted to see it because I am a big Russell Crowe fan. It turned out to be a really good movie. Visually, it is very stunning and amazing. I would give it a 10 for picture quality. The giants were why I didn't give this movie a higher rating, they were not realistic enough for me, too far out there. The story itself was far greater than i expected it to be. This movie was very intense with many battle scenes. There was also a lot of heart wrenching scenes as Noah seems to have lost his mind but is merely trying to carry out the creators's plan to a T. Noah's job is to cleanse the world and he is to have only his family on the ark, he completely ignores emotion in his decisions. This cast was perfect for this film in my opinion, Russell Crowe has a certain way about him that makes him perfect to play Noah. Anthony Hopkins was brilliant as Methusela, Noah's grandfather and Emma Watson, who plays Noah's adopted daughter who has a baby aboard the ark. The first half of the movie is really, really interesting and then once they get on the boat with all the animals it calms down a bit before rising to a terrific climax where Noah understands that he must let his granddaughter live.8.5/10 This is a wonderful movie if you just give in to the fact that it takes place in a world so far from reality, where there is crazy creatures and magic. If you go into this movie wanting to see a reenactment of the bible, you will likely hate this film. If you want to see a really beautiful film that features a story about the creators of the world in a good vs. evil battle which leads to Noah's ark and the cleansing of the world, I highly recommend giving it a try.",Noah

The rock creatures are ridiculous. The acting is good, as you would expect from Crowe and Connelly, but they can't save this really awful movie. I haven't seen a storyline this bad in a very long time.I was hoping for some good special effects of the flood, since the geological impacts of the event are so intriguing, but even they were sub-par. Now I understand why the marketing team made the movie out to be so controversial--because it was the only possible way to generate an audience. Hopefully these actors will go on to work in the great movies for which they were previously known and this movie will disappear into the great unknown.",Noah
383,onewhoseesme,True Believer,8,27 March 2014,"Russell Crowe was the right man for the job. Just as Charlton Heston was the man in his time to play Moses, so was Crowe in this time to play Noah. What many who are unfamiliar with the Bible would not see, is that they were both playing prophets. It is not personality that carries any weight here, but position. For a prophet is even more of a position than a president or a king. They are chosen and anointed by God. Driven men, they are very severe in their demeanor. They are still that way today.Prophets in the Bible were the ones who crowned the king. They did that because they outrank them. That's what the cross comes before the crown means. It is the man of God who comes before the man of the people. It does not matter whether we like that or not, it's not our show. It is God's. All of it belongs to Him. He has just given us some lights and a camera for a few minutes, and then we stop breathing. Even our breath belongs to Him. God is not shy about being God. He likes being God and He is good at it.Industrial Light and Magic who has put out the lions share of so much of the unforgettable special effects since we were kids, continues their most excellent work here. As good as they are don't be fooled by all the smoke and mirrors. A very real fallen angel is the master of that. Deception is what he specializes in. It means something is going on right in front of you, but because you don't see it, you don't think it is happening. We are so distracted with the phony that we've been trained to believe what is not going on right in front of us, just because we see it. Jesus warned us again and again about massive deception in the Last Days, and that they would be like the days of Noah. This movie shows the divide well.You can only see God with the eyes of your heart, which is your spirit. Not the organ pumping your blood. He made it that way on purpose. He does not reveal Himself to people who don't believe in Him. If you think He doesn't exist because you don't see Him with your eyes, then you have fallen for the biggest Lie in history. When you were supposed to be listening for Truth. God only wants people who love the Truth. The rest will miss the boat. Noah descended from Adam and Eve, who were not led out of the garden by something they saw. They were led out by something they heard. What is it you are hearing.Noah was a prophet and a preacher of righteousness, the Bible says so. He isn't famous for being Noah, He is famous for being a Prophet. Just as Abraham, Moses and Elijah were, after him. Throughout all of Scripture the main thing prophets do is speak God's Truth. Almost all of it is delivered in one of two ways. As a threat or as a warning. You cannot get mad at a prophet for being a prophet. That is not only his job, it is his Call. To despise them for doing what they are supposed to would make your own position ridiculous, and expose you as a hypocrite. No matter what your beliefs.It is no accident this movie was made now, even though it is director driven. Timing goes with authority. There is only one Authority. The movie has come out for His purposes alone, no matter what any others have attached to them. And He only has to get in it a little. He is a big God. If you knew Him, you would find it funny how careless people are being with their future. Most would not gamble with 5 dollars the way they are gambling with their eternity right now. Which is determined entirely in this life. When your time here ends, you go where your god goes. There is only one God. All the rest is Idolatry. I didn't say that, the Bible does. The film gets it right in the big strokes. The nature of the prophet, the shape of the ark, the global flood. The rest won't matter. Soon.As the prophet of God the voice of Noah was the most important of his generation. Do prophets still speak today. Of course they do. But if you don't even believe in God, you won't hear them. That will matter not at all, except to you. Kenneth Copeland, Keith Moore, Rick Joyner, they're all prophets. Huge ministries. Two of them are global. They've been around for decades. We're partners with all three, but we are a partner ministry with the biggest and most despised. Brother Copeland. We tell of some of the more shocking truths of Noah's day in the Wordpress link below.The voice of God's prophets is still the most important voice in the earth. You better get in on that before it's too late. Warnings only last for awhile. If God is real and the Bible is true, what kind of prophet would I be if I didn't warn you. Believers believe the Bible. If you don't believe the Bible you are not a Believer. If you don't believe in God or the Bible then it doesn't matter what you think about Noah. It only matters what you think about Hell. God is not keeping anyone out of Heaven, they have refused to come in. Get in while the getting is good friend, there's plenty of room. Your entire cost has been paid by a Friend, but you have to believe. In the Bible believing is simply a choice.

384,JackRice100,"Slow start, intriguing final third.",7,9 November 2014,"First off I'm going to judge this movie on the film aspect and not put religion into it I'm not going to say if I thought what happened is true or could even ever happen or any stuff like that.Noah is a man who is given the task to build an ark by god to save all the animals and himself from a flood. This film gives it a darker tone for this generation. I liked this film but to start with it was slow and pretty uninteresting. What kept me watching was how good Russell Crowe's performance was. Later on your introduced to Emma stone and Logan Lerman who were both great. Ray Winstone played the guy that symbolised everything wrong with the world that god was trying destroy, he would just eat animals alive and the way he carried him self was fantastic. The story really grabbed my attention was when they got onto the ark you thought everything is going to be all sunshine and rainbows but you see this family go through hell. You see everyone begin to hate Noah because of the lengths he is willing to go to follow through with gods plan. To see that unfold was so intriguing. Sadly tho I thought at times particularly in the beginning the directing was sloppy and awful on the eye. Iv heard this is a good introduction to Darren Aronofsky's work and his other films were done much better. I'll be sure to watch them at some point. At the start I found the story a bit strange and it strayed away from the traditional story I knew. On hindsight, I quite liked it, the things he added made the story more interesting and fun to watch. The dark twist near the end were you question if Noah was going crazy or was just really devoted in doing what he thought was right was great to watch. This is why I would watch this film again. A quick note on the script which I liked and thought was done brilliantly. Overall I thought this was a decent enough film with a very an intriguing ending which brings you back to re-watch it. solid 7/10",Noah

The movie is brilliant, incredibly well done visually and the actors performance were great, Russell, Emma, Jennifer, Anthony, they were at their best. I don't understand why people are complaining about Bible accuracy, this is a MOVIE, it is a fantasy, there is no Noah in real life, so stop the criticism and watch it for what it is, an entertaining movie, beautifully made with strong characters. We don't know and we will never know what happened, if it happened, so the vision on this movie to show us the kind of human beings and their belief, but we don't know if Noah struggled or not, or if he had to make a choice or not, so again, fantasy people, get over with it. Why there are so many fanatics and lunatics about religion, it baffles me, but they should learn a thing or two from Noah, so nobody is that special and there is no special or right religion.

386,andyreynolds-1,Raining on Noah's parade,6,16 October 2014,"In the beginning, Russell Crowe was a fresh faced young actor playing roles as the gladiator, an insider, Jack Thompsons gay son and it was good. Unfortunately as time marches on so do the plum roles with beautiful leading ladies in exotic locations. Now we find Russell filming in Iceland with grey hair, a long grey beard and a bit of extra girth under his belt like he's wearing a South Sydney jersey. or two. beneath his costume.The story of Noah is one well known. The world is dominated by evil so god decides to drown everyone like rats except for one man, his family and two of every creature on the planet. Sounds simple enough but we're talking about a time well before Noah could tender the contract out for the nearest Japanese ship builder to create the Ark on time and on budget.As a character, Noah is as complex as you're average god fearing hunter gatherer having a middle age crisis. He's having trouble feeding the family on the sparse paddocks of earth and wondering what it's all about when he has a dream the world will end in a hurricane of Katrina-like proportions with no Super Dome to hide in or US government to come and rescue them. eventually. Russell plays his role well. He's understandably a bit confused in the beginning but eventually Methusela (played by Anthony Hopkins) puts him on the right track and before you know it he's a determined Noah with trees to chop, animals to herd and rock angels to organise.This all understandably gets a bit stressful and Russell's journey to peaceful shores has a few rocky seas to navigate including every other man, woman and child hoping to punch their ticket aboard the ""SS Last Chance"" to help shovel manure. Our hero really starts to fray at the edges in the final act bringing out the best acting skills of Rusty himself, Jennifer Connolly as his increasingly baffled but loyal wife and Emma Watson as their adopted daughter who experiences one of the more challenging sea voyages outside of a refugee heading to the Australian coast. But there's no turning this boat back.The films obligatory bad guy, Tubal-Cain, is played by Ray Winstone. A solid mass of frothing hatred to smash against the stoic goodness of Noah. Winstone is a brilliant actor and is in his element as the evil king having fun leading his hordes and attempting to influence on Noah's second son Ham.Overall if you're a Christian then this film is for you; as long as you can accept the possibility that old Noah had some divine assistance putting his floating zoo on the high seas. If you're not a believer then you will just as happily accept this as a Peter Jackson-like middle earth populated by good guys and bad guys with the occasional rock-monster-angel happy to lend a hand to a man with a large scale maritime ambition. If you're Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist you'll probably spend two and a half hours trying to join the dots and wondering where they put all the animal poo.",Noah

I was looking forward to an epic story with plenty of action. Plus it had Russell Crowe in it. Figured it had to be a somewhat entertaining movie. I was wrong. The story was tedious and boring. The rock creatures looked like some second rate special effects. They even made the flood, hope that is not a spoiler, look ordinary at best. My review is based on the movie as entertainment.

389,sepial,Excitement over Incitement,2,10 July 2014,"Although this review contains spoilers, go right ahead and watch the film anyway if you feel you must, for whatever reason. I watched it because its director is Darren Aronofsky, and because it's got Jennifer Connelly in it. Despite my great affection for at least 4 of Aronofsky's works, both the subject matter and 'The Fountain' had me anticipate that this might be bad. I wasn't quite prepared, however, for just how bad. This latest began to transpire with the introduction of the watchers, a hybrid of that rock-monster from The Neverending Story and the Entz. Oh yes, that was right in the beginning of the movie, by the way. From there it was so cliché-loaded, so uninspired and so failing in its ambitions to unify both incompatible morals and ideas about the world that it left me with a headache, as it compelled me to serial face- palming. The raging debate ignited by stout believers about this version of the story being 'inaccurate' gives the whole enterprise a humorous touch at best, meanwhile, it wasn't the reason for my chuckling despair – to say it with Bill Maher, the believers of one piece of fiction are upset about another's piece of fiction mismatching theirs. Who gives a darn. After all, the main hero is the special effects, and, perhaps due to those alone no longer being the decisive factor, they leave cold beyond a possible initial 'woah' by a 14 yr. old. No, my despair was a familiar one, felt when ever I realize, 'damn, this would work great as a comedy,' but having to watch helplessly as the whole thing is taking itself utterly seriously. Which means the film doesn't even stand out in its ridiculousness. Nothing works. There is a clear emphasis on man's sins for which he, and with 'him' all the women and kids, is to be genocided being to a large part ecological, since it was released in A.D. 2014, and that isn't able to get off the ground. We got a villain, and as it's a bully he's played by Ray Winstone, and he's mainly necessary because since Noah is played by Russel Crowe it's a Noah who can kick ass, and does. The en masse arrival of somehow summoned animals, pairs of bears peacefully next to pairs of deer, might be compelling for this specific story, it still made me cringe, and I'm an other animals-friend. Speaking of which, the repeated vegetarianism propaganda might be noble from a related point of view, but particularly in the context of predators holding hands with prey just a bit too much. Even those approaches that should give a tad more complexity to the project, such as putting stress on Noah's fanatic character, that has him even wanting to murder his own kin, including little babies – a streak that should really THRILL the bible-lovers – and which makes perfect sense with someone who's just fine with watching the rest of his kind drown, don't work, because the filmmakers shy away from giving it strength over the altogether more apparent mild- and meekness of the character; Crowe is a very able actor, but typecast not only in a row of fake history-action dramas, but also, more or less, in the respective part therein. Unforgivable also the drop of hope betrayed when in a narrative told by Noah we're momentarily treated to a rather stunning fast forward morph showing us through the evolution of solar system and life, only to end with a verbatim imagery of Adam & Eve – sorry, Mr. Aronofsky, but you won't reconcile two opposing ideas of how world, life and, extending, humans came into being just by cutting the one off short and propping the other at its end! And on it goes. I give it one more star than worst marks for 2 reasons. One is in sympathy for the routinely underused Connelly, who gives a terrific outburst. But much more for one of the best laughs I've had in months: at the very end, the setting of which would make cheese want to walk out of the theatre, Noah blesses the baby twin sisters and says, 'be fruitful and multiply.' I was still in stitches when the end credits were finished. I mean, with WHOM? The only blokes left are dada and grandpa! A bit gross, isn't it. Of course, this bit is faithful to the original nonsense story, the implication already given (and by believers favourably ignored) with a single, troubled couple as our ancestors. Yes. And we're all Banjo Boy from Deliverance. I cannot for the life of me imagine how this should have escaped every single one involved in the making of the film, unless I missed a huge tongue in a slightly smaller cheek. But sadly, producing my laughter was clearly not intended. So please, I beg you, Hollywood, a spoof on this one, next. And for me it's the last time to have spent with any of those films by the director that smell of his clearly hysterical preoccupation with 'The Spiritual.'",Noah

On a purely technical level it's made very well, but due to the poor color use still doesn't look that great..Aronofsky is really not the guy you give $150 Million for to interpret 3 Lines of the Bible. Also what was the deal with the land? It was barren as was a specific character. How did she know that though? Must've tried a lo to be sure. Still I give this movie a recommendation to buy on Blu Ray. Not on DVD though because you really need to good sound to appreciate it. That's also the problem of the production. You need a big screen and good sound system just to enjoy this one. This should not be the case with a good move.",Noah
392,orionschwert,Not was I expected,7,18 September 2014,"To be honest, when going to the cinema I was a bit afraid of what would come but I was surprised to see a very interesting interpretation of this Bible story. The story of Noah and his quest, influenced by some fantasy stuff and a bit of action. I was pleased to see that is was not overloaded with explosions or ""overlorded"" with it's Christian story. A really nice balance was found to not loose the important points out of eyesight but keeping it visually and story telling wise always interesting enough so that you are willing to follow. It has somewhat solid acting and so for me it was time well spent and I do recommend it. It won't become member of my all time favorites but still....a surprisingly good movie.",Noah

I could add a lot more negativity to the mix, but do I really need to bring the heavy artillery to a knife fight? Watch the first half hour and you'll cry your eyes out for one of the foremost wasted talents of our time: the Aronofsky of Pi and Requiem is no more; in his stead there is a confused, self-indulgent religious nut who thinks he's Moses 2.0. Once upon a time, our dear Darren could tell a stirring story. Now he's as tedious as fat-free milk.",Noah
394,kevcoop7,Noah in Name Only,5,10 June 2016,"When I first heard about this movie, I was like ""A movie based on the biblical story of Noah? Sure! Sign me up!"" But, what I got instead was an eye sore. What was this? I understand taking artistic liberty for something that has not a lot of meat at its core, but holy crap, who said they could butcher that source material.This movie confounded me in quite a few aspects. One, Noah's sons in the Bible also had families before the flood happened so that humanity could regrow and flourish once again, but in this movie, that is NEVER touched upon, well, except for a daughter they adopted, who couldn't have kids for some reason..? Also, one seed could plant a huge forest with also running water and life from just one seed? That really confused me. I have never seen a movie where I just loathed every character, except for Anthony Hopkins' Methuselah. Even Noah himself was unlikable, and he is played by Russell Crowe, who I really like as an actor. Two last things about this movie1) The flood effects were terrible. The flood came from geysers in the movie? In the Bible, the planet destroying flood came from the very first rain the planet has ever seen. That was definitely changed, not artistic liberty,2) This is the last thing, but... Fallen angels who have been cursed by being turned to stone golems or whatever helped Noah build the ark...? That was extremely strange... All in all, if your a Christian, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Not worth it. IF your an Agnostic or any other religion, or even atheist, don't go see it anyway.",Noah
395,Anton_Klink,A good movie - and I hated it,6,5 April 2020,"It takes skill from a filmmaker and actors to evoke an emotion from the viewer and thus Aronofsky and Crowe have done their respective jobs well in this regard. However, I don't think I have ever hated a protagonist so much as I did with Noah in this movie and I am not sure that those were the emotions I wanted to feel. A religious fanatic, trying to pursue a vision that came to him in a dream supposedly from god, Noah tramples on everything and everyone. A hateful man, pursuing a hateful vision, sent by the cold, distant and hateful god of the Old Testament - I couldn't wait for someone to throw this self-righteous Noah off his ship and into the sea. The mindset represented by Noah is usually that of psychopaths and the murderous religious conviction with which he pursued his vision just reminded me of the worst dictators and tyrants in history. At least Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly were there to make this despicable story watchable. What the movie set out to show, it did well - but if you hate the story and you hate the protagonist, there are only so many points you can award. Six points is plenty generous and most of these points are thanks to Watson and Connelly.",Noah
396,Joe_Chadowski,"From both a religious and cinematic perspective, Noah is a failure",4,8 April 2014,"Am I compromised? Is this review tainted because I'm a Catholic cinephile? If you've seen my star rating than you probably figured you can rule that out. I was excited, A film from Darren Aronofsky is an event for me akin to the Olympics. That is, many years pass between his films, and when they arrive, they're freaking awesome. Within the first few minutes, all my pent-up affection leaked away. Despite Noah's fervent source material (and that's as religious as I'll get in this review, pipe down) the narrative is extraordinarily weak, and the plot feels empty, despite the 138 minute runtime. The acting is terrible, especially from Emma Watson. (it's time we stop considering her an actress and call her what she is; a model) Even the brilliant Jennifer Connelly uncomfortably shifts between hammy underacting and cringe-inducing overacting. There is no progression or cohesiveness, Noah is corrupted by a jumpiness that completely disconnects you from the film. And it uses it's largely, if 100%, CGI landscape as a crutch instead of a supplement.But the real kicker, the REAL kicker, is that there is no evidence Darren Aronofsky had any part in this film. His trademark deep darkness isn't there, his infinitely interpretable script isn't there, and his quick-cut, close-up camera isn't there. You could've told me f*****g Brett Ratner directed this and I would've believed you.It probably would've been more efficient for me to layout this review with bullet points. Noah's whole ethos counters what I stand for. It's the sort of blinged up executive express that takes a brilliant story in vain, and tries to pass as profound. I have nothing but contempt for this movie.",Noah
397,morecar,Worse Adaptation ever,1,13 June 2015,"I could give it negative numbers but I can't. It seems like the scriptwriter just had a drug trip while writing it. The only thing good about the movie is the actors and the costumes, everything else just a waste of time and money. This is not even an adaptation, a decent adaptation at least is faithful to the profile of the main characters from the source, here they not even do that.they pretty much changing the main character Noah into almost an insane fanatic villain. Pretty decent special effects. Worse of all, the miss the point of the original source book, another mistake in adaptation, especially in basic points like the fallen angels theme, the survival of humanity (like 2012 kind of deal) and the confusion of Noah on hearing God.",Noah

You know: not so young as to be traumatised by a bit of blood and CGI guts, and not so old as to be particularly discerning or critical.Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly hold this production up, in the manner of a limbo bar held so close to the ground that you may as well give up.Planetary genocide is not the breeziest of settings, yet here we are, watching millennial acting talent ham it up. It's a shame said talent don't do much more than look pretty, and run around with their mouths open.A brief scene of passion between one of Noah's sons, Shem (Douglas Booth), and his adoptive daughter, Ila (Emma Watson), has all the tender fierceness of last night's leftover meatloaf. When Ila later falls pregnant and, in the heat of a family feud, her waters break and splash onto the floor, Watson merely looks like she's dropped a packet of crisps.This could be seen as a 21st century ""Never-ending Story"" type of offering, with the semi-epic look and the fantastical and predictably servile supporting creatures--but given the original story material, the conclusion can only be a ""God is good"" sort of proselytism, which is bad enough when you don't have to pay for it.",Noah

The movie doesn't say whether its biblical or evolution. It goes through the Evolution process but when it comes to adam and eve there was a ""creator"" who was not called god which was nice - i liked that it was just called the creator.There was also a lot of fantasy aspects, with a few things i would consider to be magical.I cried towards the end because it gets very emotional with regards to family & procreation.I loved all the bits with the animals but hated some of the scenes where they got killed =( all in all it was a really good story which could be enjoyed by both believers and non believers, loved the characters who all did a fantastic job and it turned out to be better than i expected which is why i gave it a 9 out of 10.",Noah

The story only VERY generally borrows from Genesis to create a CGI-soaked disaster film. The problem with this is that most of the people who'd be interested in seeing the film do have some familiarity with the story and won't appreciate this take on it. Noah, like the God he serves, is presented as a cold-hearted executioner (very little of the behavior that provoked God's wrath in the first place is shown). Rather than present a movie that makes the story believable and plausible, it works quite toward the opposite, mocking anyone who believes it.",Noah
401,avzwam,Pretty damn bad,1,19 April 2014,"Darren Aronofsky's ""Noah"" is kind of puzzling to me. How does the director of Black swan and Requiem for a dream end up making a film like this?Why does God brutally kill Na'el (she gets her foot stuck in a bear trap and then gets trampled to death)? Like one character says to Noah, she wasn't ""evil"" which Noah seems to non-verbally acknowledge. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.Then later Noah refuses to kill two babies. So Noah doesn't seem to care about Na'el at the end of the day but these babies he does (care about). He actually goes against God's will and refuses to do what God asks even though he was OK with God killing all people except Noah, his wife and a few others. Later of course Noah feels he needs to die as well as should his wife and the other survivors as people are basically all bad, according to him. It would have been depressing had it not been so utterly stupid.Anyway, it is explained that God basically couldn't figure out for himself if people should be around on Earth so he put Noah in this situation with the babies to base his decision on how Noah feels about killing these babies and because Noah loses faith in God at this point and decides not to kill these babies God sends a pigeon with a branch in his mouth to fly through the sky which I think Noah doesn't even see, if I remember correctly. But it means that God is now fine with people being around and all is well again. Hooray! Apart from the pigeon we also see rainbows at the end as if God is really excited that things have finally gotten back to normal! Yay! Let the good times roll. We feel the love at the end of movie and we jump out of our seats and walk out of the cinema with renewed hope for the future and faith in mankind...Watching this movie for me was a saddening experience. This ancient tale of Noah isn't glorious. It's retarded. It also angered me a bit as what messages does this movie send out at the end of the day? That e.g. God has it in him to kill you if you disappoint him even though he's the one who created you in the first place and that regardless of the fact that he's a murdering hypocrite you should worship him? What kind of poison is that?Edit: I realized that I got one part mixed up. The part where Noah feels everyone should die happens before he spares the babies. Not that it matters though but I thought I'd mention it.",Noah

I agree with most of people who commented on boards and wrote reviews that before watching this film, I was also expecting it to be a remake of historical event or perhaps a better version of past Noah film. I had seen only one trailer and I hadn't seen those transformer angels. When they first appeared in film, believe me my whole enthusiasm was dashed to the ground and I was just watching the film for action and graphics. Even the graphics were of low details and I couldn't agree with its precisions because it was no bearing enough details, the views of sea were blurred after a distance. I wonder on the height of miserable mentality this director has, because you certainly don't chose to pick a topic from history and rape it in whatever way you want. There are some topics that should be told in the same way as they were and there shouldn't be any slight changes to them. So in this way, one film made on that topic is enough, a remake of it is just waste of time and money and breaking the charm of originally made film. I certainly have no words for rating this film, I rated it 4 out of 10 just because it was a good Action film otherwise if I have to rate it from historical view point, I would not give it more than 1 out of 10. I think this is the second film which I have seen whose story had been so much changed from the original path that the originality of story was lost somewhere in the dust and fog, and what was left, was just a heap of debris.",Noah
404,shannonmykayla,Where was God in this? Really??,1,3 August 2014,"I was so excited to see this Movie, the previews gave me goosebumps which I thought was preparing me for an epic adventure into the life of Noah. Ohhh boy was I ever ever wrong! Not only did this almost completely deviate from the actual scriptural account, but it mocked the very essence of what Noah was according to scripture. I am not a Religious person by any stretch but neither am I atheist or agnostic. I very much believe in God, and there are aspects of the Bible that I do believe. According to the scripture Noah was a righteous man, a good man who was a God-fearing man that was specifically and specially chosen by the Creator to perform and complete a special task. This was not felt in the movie or portrayed. There was an attempt, but it mostly focused on the dark corners of Noah's mind. I was left extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. Surely there must be a way to keep to the historical value of the story, and the principles that one can take from it without insulting the original account and God himself. Wow, above all, the insults toward God were completely the working of Man. Nearly no credit was given to the Creator. Who provided the wood? God did, not Methusalah, who built the Ark? Noah and his family not rock encrusted fallen Angels. How many survived the Flood? 8 people, Noah, his wife, their 3 sons and their wives, not this adaptation. How did the flood come about? It rained 40 days and 40 nights, water did not come up from the ground. God hated violence, he hated unrighteousness and he became hurt at his heart that he made man and regretted it. He did NOT summon Noah to kill anyone, especially babies (which are precious gifts in God's eyes), or to plot any type of murder. This adaptation was so dark and so diabolical it bordered insanity.Bottom line, how can you take a positive, encouraging story of hope, courage, integrity, loyalty, obedience, and faith and turn it into something so sinister and in effect turn God into a Villain?? Instead of calling it Noah, it should be aptly titled Spawn of Satan. Hell ""Evan Almighty"" was a better portrayal!",Noah
405,ray-331-768935,Good effects but weak story and lead.,5,6 July 2014,"Its worth the look, with lots of amazing effects but overall it turns into a drama and really takes a lot of entertainment licence with creative and ornate monsters. Its family friendly with a mix of sinister and evil, goody and baddie, and the ever aloof God personified above the clouds. Its sort of slow and slower through the drama, mostly because the story is a bit messy, with stow away baddies and corruption of minds. Its not really about the animals, more about the people and does not really sweetly speak of the animal part. The effects are brilliant and the concepts are good. However, in my mind, its the lead who really is too egoistic and testosterone to for me to empathise with. I did get bored during the sailing. The direction was great with the stop frame stuff and time lapse, this was great, and the quality of image was also stunning. I felt this movie turned into a family saga and was let down by Crowe.

The Rock people was just plain lame so was the little boy as God. I turned the movie off when I seen that.

Starting with the white horse with rider, a fiery red horse with rider, a black horse with rider, a pale horse with rider (read thru Rev 6:8) in that Chapter: you will find all the elements to entertain your audience. In Rev 6:4 ""a fiery red horse - its rider was given the power to take peace from the earth and to make men kill each other."" On Rev 9:3-4 ""And out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth, to sting those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. The locusts were not given the power to kill, but only to torture for five months. And agony those suffered. During those days men will seek death, but will not find it; they will long to die but death will escape them.""A Note to Hollywood Studios: it is important to dress women decent (NO low-cut blouses and no short shorts or skirts. If you dress women decent: you'll have the complete attention of your audiences. Besides, it is the wives that picks the movies, not the husbands.

Fallen angels (though they didn't seem to be able to decide if they were good or bad) were nothing less than Ents, minus the leaves. Even their voice sounded like Treebeard. The world, pre-flood, appeared to have dragon-dogs, greyhounds covered in scales and other mythical creatures.Ray Winstone struggled to get any depth from the 2 dimensional leader of the orks - sorry, I mean king of the men, as they burnt trees in order to forge weapons to fight the vegan Noah family.Russell Crowe did well to portray a man tortured to the point of insanity by his obsession and devotion to The Creator, even if the writers threw in bits of Abraham and Lot into his character. I felt let down, though, when after nearly murdering his grandchildren, driving his son out of the family and abandoning his wife to get drunk in a cave, all he had to do was come back and hold his wife's hand to be immediately forgiven and loved again.In summary, splendid acting, awful plot and execution.",Noah

I found the movie to be a bit boring.The big name actors and actresses deliver a decent performance, but nothing really memorable. The movie score is too and a more emotional movie score would be welcome in a movie which drags to much and makes you wonder what is going on and why.The best part of the movie was the visual effect which were very nicely done and beautiful.

I always go into a movie for what its worth and what its supposed to be not wanting every movie to be a monumental blockbuster. I have absolutely no biased opinion about this movie because i am a Christian. I went to see Need For Speed last week and was totally surprised on how good this movie was. But Noah...seriously??!! This movie was a complete waste of my eyeball energy trying to stay awake and figure out what weird scene is going to happen next. I was going into this movie not expecting it to be Biblical accurate anyway from the start. i just wanted to see a good movie. This movie was complete garbage. And not because of the ridiculous and terribly fabricated story of Noah that it portrays. The writing was bad. The CGI effects were sub par. I felt like i was watching a B movie like Flash Gordon back in the 80's with a little better special effects thrown in for good measure. If i were to sit here and type all the things wrong with this movie from start to finish, the sequel to Noah would probably be out before i was done.

OK, who cares. The other people who might like this are sci-fi fantasy geeks who will probably have a Harry Potter party while watching this on Hulu when its released. For any Christians who might be reading this, the story of Noah in this movie is completely absurd! Nothing AT ALL Biblically accurate, except they spelled the names of the characters right. I heard this movie wasn't accurate coming in to it. I didn't care. But boy was i shocked on how terrible this was done.

I was glued to my seat the entire film! The story was engrossing. While it seemed familiar it was almost equally foreign in content. Overall it is an Aronofsky film and not just a studio backed bible film. I was expecting something more gritty and less fantasy, but honestly the fantasy angle ended up being a big strength for the film. I can see why a lot of people online have given it poor reviews, they were expecting something boring and standard and were spoon fed art instead. Ignore the poor reviews and experience the film knowing you won't just be watching a few chapters out of the bible.",Noah
413,jordang73,Noah the vegetarian? Not the Aronofsky I like.,5,12 July 2014,"This movie got me by surprise, completely off guard. I thought I was going to see a serious depiction of the Hebrew myth, but instead I found my self submerged in a somehow childish recreation a la Lord of the Rings. Mr. Aronofsky has, definitely, a soft side that sometimes he likes to exploit, but so far to no avail. I like the Aronofsky of Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Black Swan, and of course, The Wrestler. When he goes deep into the personal dramas of tormented individuals he is a just brilliant. When he goes the mystical way he still does not seem to get it. Even more than in his previous mystical tale, The Fountain, Noah looks premature. Can we see personal drama in Noah? Absolutely. This time the chosen one is trapped in a very typical Hebrew dilemma: Is it just to sacrifice our own family in the name of God? Is there a higher purpose in life, something that goes beyond the individual goals, will, love an desires? That is what we got here, something that, by the way, sounds more like the story of Abraham, but I'm not against loosely interpretations and recreations of ancient myths. What I don't like is that this personal quandary seems to be overshadowed by wider philosophical and mythical problems —in this case, the relation between man and nature, animals in particular—, in a way that I consider very bad. And I don't think this theme should not be emphasized here (especially when that is exactly Noah's mission, to save animals!), but what I think is totally wrong is the moralistic tone in the treatment of the issue, something that Aronofsky has masterfully avoided in his other masterpieces. Is he getting old? Maybe. But he should remember how pernicious is trying to mix morality and art.There is much that can be said about this movie, especially every thing morally related, but I just want to talk about a particular theme that I think makes this movie look terrible. This is a moralistic tale with a very evident, almost priestly message: men are horrible creatures because of the way they (us) treat animals, and, horror of horrors! because we eat them. Had this theme been addressed in a different way it would have been much better. I don't remember having seen this theme presented that way in the Old Testament, so I assume it's a personal interpretation of Aronofsky, with a clear modern meaning. If the movie had emphasized the issue of animal cruelty less poorly I would not be so mad at it. But I really felt like some one was screaming in my face that I am a sinner, a very immoral and despicable human been because I eat meat. There were some scenes depicting animal cruelty for the sake of being cruel (like when some of those horrible men threw a goat into the air or violently slaughtered a cow), but those were just a few seconds, and I don't think there is a need for reminding us the evil of those acts. They are self evident. However, I remember very clearly how bad Aronofsky made those people look when cutting up animals in a no much different way than butchers do it at the meat market. The images were gross, and I dare to say that they were properly arranged, with cinematographic effects, to emphasize how cruel this practice is.I cant' help but seeing this like vegetarian morality in your face. I don't see how you can eat a beef without previously quartering the cow. I will not discus the ethics of vegetarianism here. I have nothing against that habit. But I don't like at all when the adherents of that trend (especially the hard core vegetarians) accuse other people for not adhering to those principles. And that is how I felt by watching this movie. Was it a subliminal message? I don't think so. I saw it like crystal clear. Again, I have nothing against vegetarianism but I do have something against people who see men like despicable creatures that deserve to be treated even worse than animals. There is a difference between education and sadistic punishment, let alone devaluation of the human species. We men have a lot to learn yet. We have no right to destroy nature. But the idea that animals are heavenly creatures that are even morally superior to men is plain childish. It seems that Aronofsky took this tale too seriously and used it (in all his rights) for his very particular world view. And by the way, if someone had told me that this was the last Shyamalan's movie I would have believed it.",Noah

Overall an utter garbage of a movie that was a waste of money and time.....the only reason I gave it a 1 as there is no option to give it zero stars.
I think the director's and producers of this movie should feel utterly ashamed of themselves, they had an opportunity to give us a massive big budget biblical epic, but instead they completely botched it and made a mockery of the bible's account
Avoid this movie at all costs",Noah
416,bobbystryker,"Noah's Ark is here in all its modern CGI glory, but does this ship sink or swim??? Read our review to find out!!!",5,8 April 2014,"So this movie seems to be getting a fair amount of flack from religious types around the world because perhaps it differs from the story they claim but cannot prove is real.I'll be the first to admit I haven't read the bible and all I really knew about Noah's Ark is summed up in this nice Disney cartoon I used to watch as a kid:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA6Sik3tJZQI was kinda expecting an old world 2012 type movie but that's not really what we have here at all. The first thing we are greeted with is a slide informing us that this is an accurate depiction of events as described in the bible. Straight off the bat the tone is set and it ain't a happy one. I thought Noah's story was set around the same time as Jesus, boy was I wrong. Let me give you a biblical timeline and outline of the original story before we delve into the movie. Adam and Eve were the first two people on earth. They had their first two sons, Cain and Abel, in the year 4004BC (4004 years before Christ)! That's ages ago!!! Cain killed his brother Abel and his bloodline developed into an evil sinful line of people spreading wickedness around the world. Adam and Eve had another son, Seth from which another line of people developed – including Noah who was born in 3000BC. Reaching something of a boiling point as mankind was seemingly lost to sin and evil, the big guy upstairs decides to cool things down with a great flood in 2350BC, wiping the slate clean and allowing life to start anew. He instructs Noah to build an ark in which to save 2 of every animal. He is also able to save his family in the ark and then try to repopulate the world after the floods. Noah somehow lived to be like a thousand years old, so this gave him and his sons as well as their baby factory wives a fair amount of time to repopulate the world – yes that means that brothers and sisters were probably sleeping with each other??Anyhow, so that's the very basic idea of what supposedly happened. So how does the movie stack up? Well, the movie doesn't quite follow the above story, so don't worry I haven't spoiled things for you guys. How much you enjoy this centers around how much you can believe what's going on. I would have preferred this to have been a straight up natural disaster movie rather than have all the religious overtones. I even prefer the Disney version in the video above to be honest. I know, I know, this is meant to be all serious and all but in the absence of characters to really root for it's hard to care about what's going on. I still wanted to see the animals go into the ark two by two but that never happens and I couldn't help but wonder if there was an alternative way to deal with things rather then just kill everyone in the flood, men, women, children, everyone. The special effects are good but I was really hoping the main flood sequence was longer and more of spectacle as it's over all too soon. It never really feels like a world ending event but more a forest flood leading into the sea. The remainder of the film is then rather dull aboard the ark in gloomy, dark, closed quarters.I wanted to enjoy this movie, I mean who didn't enjoy the story of Noah's Ark as a kid, but now as an adult the premise requires perhaps a certain amount of 'faith' without which things don't make much sense and this leads you to question the actions of the so called 'creator'. Even Noah himself seems like a crazed religious extremist at times in this telling of the story.It's worth watching if you've already seen everything else that's playing at the cinema right now, Anthony Hopkins is great as always and is probably the best thing in this movie as Methuselah, but a great film this isn't. Perhaps that's why it's been banned in so many countries??Approach with caution.Rating 5 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",Noah
417,mcshermansmithy,"Noah is intense, epic, and fantastic.",8,4 April 2014,"I believe that Noah is a sign signifying the return of biblical epics. Upsides: I thought the cast was great especially Russell Crowe as Noah and Anthony Hopkins as Noah's grandfather. The effects were pretty good, and I like the designs of the Ark. The plot is very thrilling and tense which is what you would expect from Darren Afronsky. Last but not least, I liked the themes put into Noah to make different than from average bible story. Downsides: I felt that the villain was kind of cartoonish, and the Watchers just feel like Rocky Transformers, but I got used to them.Verdict: Noah is really good, but it's not a film you would expect to be 100 percent like the story you learned in Sunday School. It is very intense and it is very moving, so don't bring any children to it (What you would expect from the director of Black Swan). But I still recommend as a film that is epic as it seems.",Noah
418,Floop1977,This film is absolutely dreadful.,1,18 April 2014,"I have just watched ""Noah"". I feel duty bound to inform everyone I know to STAY AWAY from this miserable, vomitous, excrescence of a film. Every aspect of this film was dreadful. I hated it. It has taken the top spot on my list of ""Worst Movies Ever"". I recommend you do something more useful with your time; options include painting a wall and watching it dry; sitting outside and watching the grass grow; staring at your own bellybutton and watching dust accumulate. The acting was terrible. The script was terrible. The music was terrible. The CGI was terrible. The plot was terrible. The length was terrible. It was a series of conjoined CGI set pieces with offcuts from the Transformers movie, punctuated with Ray Winston being Magwich from Great Expectations, 27 separate scenes of various women mewling painfully, a detachable escape pod on the ark a bit like in Star Wars and various James Bond films, and 73 different hairpieces for Russell Crowe.Save your money. Save your time. Save your sanity. Steer clear from this movie.",Noah
419,johnkampouropoulos,Excellent Film,9,8 September 2021,"OK, let me be clear on one thing: I am not interested in the religious accuracy. If I wanted to know about Noah and the Arc, I would read the Bible or the Book of Genesis. That being said, this film is not a documentary and don't waste your time expecting such a thing.In respect of an alternative version of a tale, it was superbly executed and filmed. I liked every element and the editing was flowing along with the action smoothly. CGIs were just perfect. All cast were up to their task brilliantly, both Crowe and Connelly gave an outstanding performance in every aspect of the film, and the controversy between Winstone and Crowe worked like a charm.I also liked this point of view: a near apocalyptic Earth and its people who are kind of not distinguished in terms of civilisation, but are like a pulp of degraded mob, not giving a darn if Good vanishes in a swamp of Evil. It's a really good idea the fact that humanity perishes and restarts on a new day and a new era, forming -as the story sees it- our presumed present.(*note that many ancient civilisations shared the same ""deluge punishment"" in their mythology, for the exact same reasons: the fall of men into sin and evil deeds)This film is about the deeper meaning of Choice, in my opinion. God is just something people believe in, but the choice is theirs. And it takes more than just strong will to make it happen; it takes love and mercy.Good and Evil are depicted in a way that's pretty realistic; in every good soul there's a sleeping demon, and within every evil soul there's a hidden light overloaded with pride. Neither side are unidimensional (hence the ""Choice"").Back to tech stuff now: even though I'm not so fond of adaptations (I rated 2 stars on another TV series about Troy's war) I do respect one thing, and that's the ability to persuade by script and realisation. Let me elaborate this: ""300"" for example, is anything but the real story behind the battle of Thermopylae. It only uses some core elements of the true facts to build an awesome fairy tale, in terms of both realisation and feeling. Despite factual exaggeration and overwhelmingly cult props and images of the era, still remains a masterpiece in its own right. That's what I mean by giving a straight 9 to ""Noah"". The adaptation was excellent and is worth your time.",Noah
420,feudalserfer,I wanted to drown myself by the end,3,30 July 2014,"I watched ""Noah"" on DVD last night. Thankfully, I didn't go to see it at the cinema as I'd originally planned. Four hours into the movie, the timer on my DVD player said: ""47 minutes"". Crowe seems to be turning into a caricature of himself. I don't know about the great Flood, but by the end of the film I was ready to drown myself. Oh, and Ray Winstone is a really, really lousy actor. Whoever cast him as Cain deserves to burn, that's for sure. It sounded more like Michael Caine. As for Emma Watson, she will forever play herself, I fear. ""Wingardium Disappearo"", is my prediction. Only Jennifer Connelly emerges with any credit for giving the movie a little depth and soul. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful. Right down there with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""White House Down.""",Noah
421,DearIMDB,Oh Dear,1,10 August 2014,"I watched the film diligently right to the end, at which point I couldn't stop myself from saying, ""What a load of tosh!"" Russell Crowe is always good value and so too Ray Winstone, but both would have been better occupied learning how to crochet instead. Anthony Hopkins was doing it for the money I guess and Emma Watson was, I felt, miscast. Logan Lerman was decorative as I suspect he was meant to be. I found the whole thing unmemorable despite the amount of money which was undoubtedly lavished on CGI and as I sit here writing about it, there are huge chunks of it I just can't remember. Best performances came from the Watchers which is ironic given that so many actors performances today can be compared to stone. I would say therefore, don't waste your time. Go bowling!",Noah
422,Abumaor,Big Expectations- Even bigger disappointment,4,6 September 2021,Russell Crow and Anthony Hopkins are two of my favorite actors in Hollywood. I don't know however what they were looking for in this weird movie.I lost interest completely when it started to remind me of the transformers movie.The story is boring. The acting is weird. It is not clear what they wanted to accomplish with this film but definitely it's one big messy weird movie.,Noah
423,jcmann01,Did We Just Watch The Gladiator Play Noah??,2,1 April 2014,"I will say that watching it on the big screen, gave it spectacular scenes during the initial flood and the voyage on the ocean.However, like anything else Hollywood ever comes out with, that is supposed to be based on historical accounts of the Bible; BUT it bares little resemblance to written history. In this case, they took a wonderful Bible story and turned it into a ridiculous 3 ring circus; starring the Gladiator at center stage, Lord of The Rings to the Left, and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" baby killer, running around on the Ark with a dagger on the right. You will get what I mean when you see the movie. No where in the scriptures does it say that Cain made it onto the ark or that transformer like creatures called ""watchers,"" which were angles encased in rock, according to Hollywood, and were running around helping mortals to build industrial civilizations? Or that Methuselah handed out magical beans that could create forests complete with entire eco systems and performing Jesus like miracles on barren grand daughters, while in the midst of foraging on his hands and knees for berries in the forest? What's up with that??They didn't need a bunch of Hollywood make-believe non-sense to ruin an already good bible story. If they had just stuck with the Bible's account of Noah, it would have turned out to be a magical treat along with the great scenery effects.I will say that Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson gave an impressive acting job for their given roles.",Noah
424,vampture,Amazing,10,5 July 2014,This may be the best movie I've seen in years. It really did move me. I'm agnostic but really loved this movie. Too many people are getting caught up in the details of the original bible story. If you can forget all that and ignore the trolls you'll probably really love this movie.The cast is perfect and deliver amazing performances. All of them! The special effects/CGI are amazing. I could watch it for that beauty alone.It's nothing really like any other movie by Darren Aronofsky which are usually sort of dark. This one is actually sort of inspiring and feels good.,Noah
425,jacobclark512,"Noah Brings Biblical Epics into Today, and Does It Well",6,1 April 2014,"Noah is the first Biblical epic in quite some time to be a good film. It focuses on bringing a heavenly story from over 4,000 years ago into the modern age of film, and it does so quite well. The acting is impeccable, and the great ensemble cast exceeds expectations. Russell Crowe delivers one of his best performances as Noah, making him gritty and realistic enough to relate with. The entirety of Noah's family also has good performances, especially Emma Watson and Logan Lerman as Ila and Ham, respectively. Meanwhile, Anthony Hopkins delivers as Methuselah, Noah's primary mentor, making him very similar to Odin in the Thor movies. Ray Winstone also has a fantastic performance as Tubal-Cain, being both physically and mentally imposing as the antagonist. Overall, a beautifully acted movie that will get overlooked come next awards season, as all early releases are.Noah is fantastic visually as well. The direction from Darren Aronofsky shows a personal touch that is often missing in so many big-budget films. The visual style is far from the usual grandiose look that biblical films often have; instead Aronofsky opts for a gritty look, in a similar way that 2013's Man of Steel did to differentiate itself from the original Superman movies. This is compounded by the choice of Iceland as the location chosen to shoot the film, as the lush landscapes of the Fertile Crescent are replaced with the harsh Icelandic landscape. The cinematography makes Noah look fantastic, further adding to its realism and grit. The set design of the ark is phenomenal and abandons all previous incarnations of the famed vessel, opting for a box instead of any resemblance of a boat. The visual effects also bring the animals and ocean to life, making an already good movie even better. The best part about the visual aspect of Noah is that nothing distracts from the film itself; instead, it simply adds another dimension to it.Noah is also well-written by Aronofsky and Ari Handel. Now, before you start calling me out for blasphemy, let me tell you that this is not a literal Bible-to-screen adaptation. That being said, the liberties taken with the original Genesis account are mostly slight and do not detract from the original meaning of the story. Some are more noticeable than others; for example, Ila even being in the story is more noticeable than Lamech's death or Cain's descendants robbing the earth's resources in their constant imperial expansion. The only true element of artistic license that detracted from Noah for me was the scene where Noah recounts the creation story to his family. The story itself is accurate; however, the footage accompanying it risks being downright offensive to believers of any of the three faiths that believe in the Great Flood (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity) because it depicts theistic macro- evolution as the way God created the world. This is inexcusable, even if Aronofsky himself is an atheist. Please be sensitive to your target audience, Hollywood.I won't go into any of the other inaccuracies because I truly want you to see this movie. Noah is a very good start to this year's blockbuster season and arguably rises above almost every other Biblical epic made. Its superb acting and direction, along with some traditional yet enthralling Hollywood embellishment, make it a film for everyone to enjoy. Highly recommended.",Noah
426,pg-tsinc,In the beginning there was nothing ?,4,6 April 2014,"I agree for some ""historic"" modifications to make good movie$. In the the 2014 Aronofsky film Noah, it starts with: ""In the beginning, there was nothing'' A bit flat compare to the bible real text which is: ""In the beginning God created heaven and the earth...And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters"", quite different from ""nothing"" don't you think ? I already had a bad feeling after 60 sec. The ""alterations"" that Paramount made, upset Aronofsky: uninspired and inartistic. Not surprise that it has been banned from many countries...for religious and sense disintegration (surmise by ""nothing"", + the Transformers bug).Noah ""transform"" himself from a wise patriarch to some kind of a robot with a Neanderthal IQ (determined to kill the baby if Ila gives birth to a girl, and ready to kill his whole family for that).I got out of the theatre when the Ark aground... too bored to ask for a refund. I'll ''Watch IMDb'' + closely before going to another Paramount movie. By the way, I think that there was 3 versions of the film, one of them concern a werewolf who stowaway in the ark and bite Noah and... (just kidding).",Noah
427,rewolfsonlaw,Doesn't Hold Water,2,4 May 2014,"Having watched this abomination almost a month ago, I'm trying to remember now why I generously rated it two stars. I am a fan of simplicity in storytelling: no need for spectacular effects. Please just give me dialog from the mouths of fully developed characters. This film falls flat.The movie bounces from antediluvian to post apocalyptic without rhyme or reason. Noah, his wife and sons are foraging vegans (though it looks an awful lot like they're wearing animal skins), hiding in the scant brush from the savage meat eaters who, though the narrator (a narrator for Heaven's sake?)tells us a great industrialized society has covered the earth. Really? I was at least hoping for an Edgar Cayce Atlantis or better still, Lemuria- some great civilization predating our own. Instead, the director called on his theological experts who apparently received their ordination from the back of Rolling Stone magazine. Honestly, Madonna has a greater understanding of religious mysticism than the writers here.From roving bands of hunters to computer generated hoards of mindless minions led by a nasty stowaway whose presence on the ark is a little like the alien popping out of Sigourney Weaver. Ridiculous.Add a cameo of Methusala (yes, Methusala),some fallen angels dressed like Transformers to help build the boat, mix in computer generated animals that look like stock footage of animals running from a fire, waste the talent of Jennifer Conneley playing Mrs. Noah (a real afterthought) and you have a film that rushed to market before the ark would float.Oh, and most kids who went to Sunday school know the snake lost its legs AFTER it told Eve to try the fruit (depicted here as a pulsating pomegranate); Noah keeps having visions of the serpent slithering along BEFORE the ""original sin.""My favorite line: When Noah says in reference to the folks left to drown, ""It is painful."" No. God is always merciful. Their suffering ended early in the movie. The rest of us watched it 'til the end.",Noah

430,Cydone,Noah reminds me of a suicide bomber with religious psychosis,5,26 July 2014,"While acting is alright, I did hope for a more middle age like setting, instead of this mythical one. What I hate about this movie is that we come to like Noah, and in the end all you want to do is smash his head in with a brick.Noah becomes more and more fundamental in his beliefs, and the length he goes to makes me wonder how his family would ever be able to truly forgive him again. I mean, even if he was given a choice, not to do evil, he was extremely slow and crossed way over the line.The torment he has already put his family through, makes him the most evil of all the characters in the story, especially the coldness in which he portraits his religious mental illness.It could have been a good movie, but was ruined by a religious idea of selfrightiousness, that whatever evil you have done, you are alright in the end, if you start to do right. Bullshit.Noah is a mental patient, just like all the other lunatics running around blowing themselves up. He should have died on that beach, a drunkard and familyless, that would have been just.",Noah
431,vinceb-3,More Soap Opera Than Adventure,2,7 April 2014,"I'll let Biblical scholars sort out the purported inaccuracies, I'm just here to say Noah is a bad movie. I always thought, perhaps naively, Noah's Ark was about animals. This movie, however, devolved into should a baby be allowed to live. That's it! Not saying that isn't important, but I never would have guessed a story about Noah's Ark would be so little Ark and so much soap opera.Also, Hollywood once again fails to develop the protagonist. We learn VERY little about Noah, what makes him tick, why God would choose him over anybody else. . .who he REALLY is! Character development is a lost art in Hollywood, and another reason I rarely wish to see a modern movie more than once.",Noah
432,BadSausages,"Catastrophically Abysmal ** May contain spoilers, soy, peanuts, milk, gluten",1,9 May 2014,"Hey, it made a fortune for a bunch of people. And wasn't that the only real point for making it? Can't wait for the sequel.The actors did their best with a script from the depths.Noah, the Biblical story, isn't much of a story, for all its popularity. And it isn't significant in any moral way. It is merely a retelling of older flood stories, most notably a story from the Sumerian ""Epic of Gilgamesh."" But it is, for some reason, very popular.The problem is, it has no real plot. Build an ark. Get on ark. Wait of rain. Wait for rain to stop. Get off ark. No. No. Not exciting.The stories of Sh'ton, Waayru, and Magoth are equally interesting, but were so less popular that they didn't make the final draft of the Bible. Each of Sh'ton, Waaru, and Magoth, like Noah, was told to build an ark to save himself, his family, and the animals from a great flood. Each devotes his life and the lives of his family to building the ark. But then there is no flood. And each dies without having accomplished much. Their families are pinda kissed, too.The story of Begroth is a little different. He and his family built their ark and loaded animals. And there was a great flood that killed everything. But then Begroth's ark turned out not to be so watertight. Again, not such a great story. Also, there was that nagging question about how we could all be here after that. So, it too didn't make the final draft.The Biblical Noah is good. Very good. The goodest. Hence is he chosen. Note that the only thing we see about Noah is that he is obedient to God and that he gets drunk and naked in his own tent. Apparently, given the actions of his sons, being naked in one's own tent is very bad thing. But he is righteous nonetheless.The natures of his sons and their wives, who will thenceforth be the forebears of humanity, are not given. Except that son Ham is bad for seeing Noah naked. (Note that ""naked"" might not be the best possible translation of what Noah was (doing) when Ham saw him.) As it turns out, Noah's sons and their wives might not have been the best choices. See, for example, the news.Is the Noah of the film ""Noah"" good or, as he says, *** SPOILER ALERT *** merely a man trusted to get the job done? Regardless of what his wife might think, ""Noah"" 's Noah is brooding and heartless. Sorry, but among other things, a decent person does not *** SPOILER ALERT *** permit an innocent young woman to be trampled to death, regardless of what that person believes is his own purpose in life. A decent person does what can be done to help others and anguishes over the suffering of others. A good Noah would say to Tubal-cain that he (Noah) was sorry that he (Noah) was unable to save him (Tubal-cain).Ham of the Bible is someone for whom I am sympathetic. He sees Noah naked in Noah's tent and tells his brothers. His brothers then cover Noah without looking at him. For this, Noah curses Ham. Of course, this little piece of the story was inserted by people who wanted to denigrate Canaan, hence, they inserted that Ham was the father of Canaan and he and his descendants, the Canaanites, are cursed to be slaves to his brothers and their descendants.Ham of the file ""Noah"" isn't a person I can respect at all. *** SPOILER ALERT *** I would have fought harder to save, or at least stay with, Na'el. And, failing that, I would have returned to her and died too, rather than get on the ark with Noah. There would, after all, be no point to surviving on the ark. Ham doesn't do much else. He *** SPOILER ALERT *** permits Tubal-cain to stay on the ark and to eat animals and to try to kill Noah. None of which is good at all. Okay. He *** MAJOR SUPER ULTRA SPOILER ALERT *** ... well, if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you. But everyone else knows. Even so, it does not redeem him.The rest of the actors are little more than window dressing. They contribute neither to the plot nor to any character development. There is no character development.Jennifer Connelly is hot (still). So, yeah, I like her in pants. But, pants, really? Tight pants. In the time of Noah?Emma Watson is hot, too. So, you know, you might not want to make her up to look like Zero Mostel (e.g., *** SPOILER ALERT *** in the scene where she's standing on the ark holding the babies).The battle scene is pointless. *** SPOILER ALERT *** An army rushing the ark, fighting the Watchers and Noah. And then, the Army is just washed away. 'cause, you know, the Creator can do that. And, for that matter, why wasn't Methuselah there to help Noah? I mean, after all, *** SPOILER ALERT *** remember from early in the film what he did when men were killing the Watchers? That's the kind of guy you would like to have defending the ark. Or, at least, his sword.Which brings us to the absurdly depicted *** SPOILER ALERT *** water shooting up from the earth and later rushing from all around the ark to slam the ark on all sides. The ark is three stories tall. The water is as high as the ark. Three stories height of water crashing into the ark from all sides. That is REALLY good construction.",Noah
433,beglenrice,This is an outstanding film!!! Don't believe the fake reviews,10,1 April 2014,"I saw Noah a couple nights ago and was so impressed. It took a story and asked some difficult questions about humanity all the while asking ourselves to decide which version of it we prefer to live out in our own lives. It's genius! I came online here expecting other people to have similar reactions. Perhaps not surprisingly, however, there are many extremely (!) negative reviews. I have read a few and sincerely believe some of these people did not see the movie, but are religious extremists with some kind of agenda. It is sad to imagine that people are trying to rip a movie that intelligently and entertainingly engages us in asking tough questions about hope and love and what we really are.. But then some of these people are the same kind represented in the movie as the barbaric, selfish hordes who are only think of themselves and have little logic on which to base their opinions. Bottom line, don't listen to the religious fanatics, go see this great movie! By the way, in case this is of any interest, I am a Christian. My father is a pastor and I was raised reading the stories of Genesis since I was a youth. I hope people of all faiths, atheists, Christians, etc., will see this film because it inspires us to look at each other with compassion. It inspires us to want to choose to support a world where we embrace each other, not hate each other. It's amazing (and then again, maybe not so much) that many people fail to understand this movie and what might be its message as they also fail to understand the Bible and what might be its message: ""Beloved, let us love one another. For love is of God, and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God. He who loves not, knows not God, for God is love."" 1 John 4:7,8",Noah
434,VimalaNowlis,Typical Hollywood Hype and Bunk,5,24 March 2014,"Of all the flood stories around the world from different cultures, Noah is the least believable. The problem with ""Biblical"" epics is that when faith kicks in, everyone involved shut down their brains.The scale of the ark in the movie is absolutely ridiculous. 125,000,000 and they couldn't spend a bit on research on where Noah lived? They lived in an arid region. Trees were rare and wood were expensive. There were not that much wood to build his huge ark even if he cut down all the trees and shrubs within 500 miles radius. That's why the people there built their houses with mud bricks and their temples with stones.With so many rolling hills and deep wadis in the area, where could Noah have found such a huge vacant flat space to build his ark?

Unfortunately film director Darren Aronofsky completely missed this point and the result is a cinematic disaster.Watching this movie left a chilling effect on me as I left the theaters. I was outraged, upset and simply mortified that a story of such epic proportions could be twisted around and retold in a way that leaves audiences completely void of the truth.I shouldn't be surprised though, the film's director Darren Aronofsky is a self-proclaimed Atheist, and yet this man directed the film! But as I researched more to find out the truth I found his self-proclaimed goal was to make Noah the ""least Biblical Biblical movie"".

It has to rank right up there with Ishtar and Battlefield Earth.Minor spoilers but nothing you won't see other places The beginning was the worst. Where did they get their food? Rock creatures? Come on, give me a break. Nothing of this is even in the slightest degree believable. People say the events in the bible are not believable but this goes well beyond that. In the beginning I was thinking that this must be a parody. To be fair it is somewhat based on the book of Enoch and some other ancient writings which were not included in the Bible because they were thought to be too fantastic. But even these books did not go this far down the rabbit hole. Even the weirdest of the ancient books don't go as far as rock creatures.Nothing says that God did not want humanity to survive.

I realize that making a purely religious movie in 2014 for mass appeal is a very risky proposition; however, the director and screenwriter could have organized the plot and script in a way that could have resonated more with most moviegoers, at least for artistic reasons. Artistically speaking, the movie is mediocre at best, and it is sad to see how such a talented cast ended up acting so badly, which makes me think the director should have been fired after the first week of shooting the movie. Yes, Hollywood producers are notorious for misreading or underestimating the sentiments of their customers, and this movie is a good example of that.Simply put, this movie will be forgotten in less than 3 months, and will certainly join the list of movies that relied heavily on marketing to bring moviegoers to see an artistically-flawed movie.",Noah
438,thefinalword,no character love whatsoever,5,6 July 2014,"I usually base my movies on one thing, would I like to see it again someday; this is one of those movies that I really wanted to give a 7 to. However, I can only manage a 5. And that says a lot, there is very little reason for you to love these characters--- Instead of spending money on 3D stuff and wasting precious screen time on creepy rock walker things moving around, they could have added in more history and concretization of the premise, more background on the characters. It just felt like it was ""run through the paces"" so to speak. Like a prize horse that never actually takes off running. I found this movie just, annoying, because I wanted to enjoy it so much-- but there were things that sort of redeemed it. The alternate timeline (or is it?) was interesting, I wanted more background but it was pretty cut and dry. The people mad about it not being faithful, well, I agree with them kind of. You already had the framework for a great tale. I don't understand why the execution feels so weak, the movie should be fun but it just fails to spark for me.",Noah

To merely state that it's inaccurate is to state the obvious. But to have no credibility whatsoever, only resembling the true story in that the guys name was Noah is more to the point. News Flash, who knew that Noah was a martial arts expert, schooled obviously in Shaolin style Kung Fu. Surely not I. Nothing about this movie made any sense. Even if I hadn't known the true biblical account, this movie just threw things together for the obvious point of trying to advance a story, and I use the term ""story"" very very loosely. The writers of this nonsense should be banned from ever doing work in Hollywood again, the producers stripped naked and run through the streets of LA throwing out refund money to all patrons that sat through this cocophony of manufactured feces. Shame on Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins for appearing in this travesty, the only excuse would have to be that they never saw the product or read the script save for their own parts and certainly never saw the finished product.",Noah

On what passages were the screenplay writers using to produce this complete fabrication? Absolute fantasy. The background landscape was so barren that you would have to wonder how the family was so robust and healthy existing on rocks and algae. Where did they find fabric and sewing implements and how come the wife never was seen doing basic chores? Why did Noah shave his head? Why the rock people and the bad king stowing away on the ark? The bible I scanned said that Noah and his wife and 3 sons and their wives and their children got on the ark. Never did Noah threaten to kill Shem's new born girls. Why this BS? I am not a religious person, but this was a complete farce and an insult to folks that have religious convictions.

441,fredphoesh,Heavy handed and shallow - dismally poor storytelling,1,5 April 2014,"First off, there is no need for a spoiler alert for this film. The animals come in two by two, there is a massive flood, they survive on the boat... yada yada...The movie fails to address basic questions, why did Noah interpret ""god's word"" in the way he did, and why did he come to the conclusion it was god's will to punish ALL people, and therefore he had to murder his son's twin daughters to obey god... The idea of a god who would do this is ridiculous, but the biblical story of Noah is obviously not true, and casts the image of a very black and white god, who would see all the people on earth as ""bad"" and save a small family, no wait, not the whole family, Noah's father was not good enough to be saved, so he had to die too... minor detail, the issue is never addressed at all.The utterly bombastic effects and sensationalist heavy movie came no where near explaining or even giving us an indication of what may have caused people to do what they did, we were just to assume that Noah was very pious, and would rather murder children than not do what he (incorrectly) interpreted god to say/mean.The reason for this disregard for subplot is that there is no place for it. This is an action movie with zero depth and understanding of humanity. The brush strokes are thick and stupid, and if there was an antonym for masterpiece, this would be it.",Noah

443,ceidt,Not-So-Biblical Epic (Exactly as it should be),8,30 March 2014,"""Noah"" is the story of Noah.The best The Bible can do is give us a message. It is full of messages. When Hollywood takes over, what we see is an interpretation of a story that was meant to give us a message. For many stories, translated into too many languages, interpreted too many ways, we take what we can get. What you learn from any situation would be learned a completely different way from another person resulting in different lessons. ""Noah"" is the story of Noah. It is his lesson in the end. The message of the movie is an important one.I'm not sure the same message had gotten across from The Bible, as there isn't enough of the story of Noah in The Bible for a film. In The Bible, Noah is chosen. In the film, we learn why Noah was chosen.The film is also made with mass audiences in mind. We can appreciate themes of love. We can appreciate how we hurt each other. We can appreciate why God was angry with the world as it was and needed to start again. Kids have their villain and subtle humor. Horror fanatics also have plenty in this film. There's also quite a fantastical element. This flick could spawn action figures if it wanted to. Evolutionists can see how many species (including a feathered dog-like creature) died out and imagine how many species descended from others. And for me? Film buffs, too, have an experience to behold. The acting isn't awful, although there is a lot of crying...and I don't mean the massive rains and flooding.I really enjoyed my experience of watching Hollywood's take on someone's interpretation of the story of ""Noah. If you were looking for the ""Based on a True Story"" version...sorry...you can't even find that in the Bible.",Noah

This film was more of a joke than a real telling of the Noah story from the bible. Its hard to put into words what is wrong with this movie yet Im going to try.. First of all there's the use of CGI rock creatures which is totally absurd, This is supposed to be a biblical epic not a Scifi film.Next there's Ray Winstone acting and sarf landon accent, how ridicules to expect people not to laugh out loud at such terrible acting and the use of the English language..who ever says hes a great actor wants there head examining.Next the bible says it rained for 30 days and 30 nights yet most of the water in the film comes from under ground.Why O Why did Russel Crow ever agree to be in this load of total cr.p (he must have been in need of the money) and didn't the backers read or see what was planned for this movie. I gave this film 3 in the voting and that was pushing it..",Noah

446,interastral,"Incredibly moving, fantastical, retelling of the story of Noah.",10,22 February 2020,"I was immediatly struck by how this film transports you to an older mythical version of the Earth, and introduces the viewer to the Biblical story.
A primordial, dreamtime of ancient humanity, where Mankind is still close to God, and miracles are real. Here the art direction tends toward fantasy, and this is an artistic decision that uniquely suits this epic story.Noah is portrayed as a faithful shepard, seeking to save the world. He is gentle but strong, and Russell Crowe portrays him perfectly. All of the characters are portrayed with emotion and depth, which invites the audience to care about their story, which is indeed, a universal human story of mankind's fall from grace and search for redemption and harmony with nature. This is a deeply spiritual film, and it's heart and soul is in exactly the right place.The cinematography is bleak and beautiful, and other times radiant and emotive. It's a joy to behold. And the tale is not without action and intrigue either, with plenty of suspense and mystery to keep you engaged.The culmination of Noah moved me to tears of joy and sorrow, at the beauty and tradgedy of humankind. An ultimately life affirming, thought provoking and profoundly moral retelling of this classic Biblical myth.I would recommend it to anyone, whether you are religious or not. It's just an excellent, awesome movie, all round. Enjoy!",Noah
447,PostingandToasting,Noah and the Terrible No Good Very Bad Day,7,3 April 2014,"Man what a bummer...I mean, not that the Biblical story of Noah and the Ark is supposed to be cheerful or anything but just the constant gray and rain, mopiness, and general poor outlook on the nature of mankind is just kind of depressing..Was that offensive? It wasn't meant to be but there are bound to be those to see it that way.That should have been the tag line for Darren Aronofsky's epic, ""Noah"" whether thats fair or unfair to say is up to you but when dealing with such sensitive material that means a lot to millions of people, you are gonna rub some the wrong way. So while saying that, this was actually a story I had been hoping was made into a live action film for some time now. Now when a story of this magnitude is going be taken on there are a few key ingredients that are all MUST HAVES; A top notch director, a bona-fide leading man, and a big budget.Director: Darren Aronofsky CHECK Leading Man (and period piece master): Russell Crowe CHECK Big Budget: $130 million CHECKSo what went wrong exactly? Well long story short is that while I went into the theater expecting to see one film, I was unexpectedly treated to two films on one reel. The first half was a loud, raucous, and fantastical story of the beginning of man leading up to Noah and his vision he has of God telling him that he is going to destroy the world and every man in it after his grandfather (Anthony Hopkins who was born an old wise man) slips him a mickey in his tea. Then he gathers his wife (wonderful Jennifer Connelly) and his three sons and adopted daughter to build the ark out of a freshly built forest thanks again to Grandfather Hopkins and his magic beans. One question that people ask when they hear the story of Noah is how could one man build a ship that big himself anyway? Well, fear not fellow wonderer's for according to Aronofsky, Noah had giant, lord of the rings-esque, rock creatures known as ""The Watchers"" who were apparently the spirits of fallen angels that God had sent down to Earth after ""failing"" him. The Watchers not only protected Noah and his family, but also appeared to have built the ark for him! Talk about lucking out! Then the flood eventually happens, after all of the CGI animals have arranged themselves on the ark and put into a deep sleep and a massive battle occurs where the rock ""Watchers"" fight off the rest of the sinful men as Noah and his family escape. The whole time I was thinking...This isn't Aronofsky, it's too simple, it's too generic, I was gravely disappointed.First film grade: 5/10 (visuals were impressive enough to give it at a 5...I mean I guess so right?)Now the second film begins at the point where we all wonder what happens next and is what happens to Noah and his family when they actually are on the ark and are forced to survive. Here we witness the true dedication of Noah to please God and fulfill his task at hand. The inner conflict that we watch Noah and his family visually struggle with is very powerful and we begin to sympathize with him and question if we would be able to handle such a burden ourselves. We see him make drastic choices and rash decisions that will affect not only his family but all of mankind. This is where we finally see Aronofsky's fingerprints, all of his previous films feature flawed characters that are put up against drastic circumstances along with a bold social commentary on a specific issue. ""Noah"" can be looked at from several angles from the complexity of man and how they are more than capable of both good and bad to a PSA about protecting the environment.Second film: 8/10FINAL GRADE: 7/10I can't knock the film for being entertaining, that's the purpose of film after all (I feel many people forget this) but the overall confusion of the direction of the film became an issue. Aronofsky tried to please everyone. He wanted to make a kick ass action/adventure film that would attract the masses along with making it artsy and have a profound message that left you thinking as the credits rolled. His inexperience with the former was evident but not enough to make FIRST FILM bad..just mediocre. But he struggled to combine both films together to make one potentially GREAT film.Now I consider myself a fairly religious individual. I am Catholic and I believe in God and I don't really care if you do or not (so there!) but when it came to stories like Noah in the Bible and how atheists use these stories to disprove the existence of God and the fallacy that is organized religion I counter with this. The Bible, as with other religious texts like the Torah or Qur'an, I don't believe these stories were supposed to be taken literally but rather figuratively. These texts were written to be guidelines of how to live your life the right way. The story of Noah to me is meant to be a cautionary tale of what could potentially happen to our planet if we continue on the path we have been on for thousands of year. It also tells me that we are capable of change and the movie reiterates these themes throughout. So in the end, it's one of Aronofskys' weaker films (not necessarily a slight because a ""weak"" Aronofksy film is still better then the majority of films out in theaters). ""Noah"" is entertaining, it's thought provoking at times, and wet. But at the end of the day, much like a dark, gray, and rainy day...it's a bit of a bummer.",Noah
448,tortillachips-972-975637,Is that you Noah?,1,27 April 2014,I went to the movies with high expectations and excitement. I almost felt like a little kid going to say a Disney movie me. However when I got there from the beginning I was like okay what is this? I have read somewhere that the director did research and went to some Christian ministers etc to find out about Noah's story. Now I do know that Hollywood always has to put their spin on a story but like this? I mean he totally destroyed the story! And I took some things with a grain of salt but after each 15 minute increments it kept getting worse and worse further from the story and further from the story. I mean really a stowaway???!. I'm not sure who's Bible he went to or if he decided I'm going to make this story my own I'm not sure what the director was thinking. But I think he should do some sort of interview or a posting stating why he did this movie this way. Because it is not and I repeat is not the story that is in the Bible. One of my friends wanted to work out but she stayed only because the rest of us stayed to watch the end of the movie. I guess I stayed because I had hoped somehow it would finish well. As usual the world takes Christianity and what God says in the Bible and destroys it because they do not want the real message to be seen.,Noah
449,deceiver-1,Fun movie with comic book liberties,7,28 March 2014,"This movie looks like a good faithful telling of the biblical version in the previews. Then you see it and it's far from that. Needless to say the twelve noon showing in our little town theater had many more people at it than I usually see. Lots of people here have reviewed this flick and have done a good job. I'd like to add a few whimsical additions if I may. First of all, the addition of the rock creatures was certainly entertaining but immediately let us know that this director was going to tell the story differently. Let's face it, the Flinstone version of Transformers was certainly a surprise and humorously entertaining. Noah's father living on a mountain in a cave was a grand wizard out of some Tolkien type story. On a darker note the baby issues at the end were a bit unnerving. Was that in the biblical version? If you're going to be entertained then this movie will do that to a good extent. If you were expecting an documentary account of the old testament then you either were disappointed or LYAO when you watched parts of it. After all, let's face it. The original version is : God told him to build an ark, he built it and the animals came, it rained, then it cleared and the animals left.

What was Aronosky thinking ? the entire film was shot in low lighting that alone was annoying Crowe's NOAH was a Psychotic Nut Case willing to kill member of his own family because he though that was what ""The Creator"" wanted please note anytime there was reference to ""God"" he was called The Creator as the work ""God"" was never used . It was amusing that there were 20 story rock people who helped NOAH build the Arc yes 20 story rock people. Who looked like the Claymation figures from the 1950's bad science fiction films.

This movies is an excellent adaptation of the fantasy like story of Noah and even dare I say it, it is one of the most accurate representation of this fantasy like story from the Bible.Do not get me wrong, faith is important but in someways, every religion is just a fantasy based human creation with stories full of fantasy and imagination. It depends on you to choose one religion over an another but keep that in mind that it is just your choice of fantasy.
If we keep this in mind we realise that this is Aronofsky's fantasy of how he imagines the stories from the Bible and I think it is a somewhat beautiful perspective. I loved every scene, the action, the drama, the acting and the list goes on.Christian movies are universally hated because of their low quality and if one of the most talented directors create something like Noah, they become generally hated from christians who like to keep their religion simple minded and almost borderline stupid.",Noah

""Pulp Fiction"" is one that was a huge wasted of time, money and effort.Last night, sitting through ""Noah,"" I was pleased with the story's development - characters, et al. I was OK with the actors and their capture of their respective roles. Costuming was a bit weird, e.g. - Noah wearing a button-up coat. In the grand scheme of things, not a huge problem. CG was also nicely done, so kudos to that creative talent! I would say the first 1/2 or so of the film was pleasing. It very rapidly went downhill - at breakneck speed! The last 1/2 of the film was a complete adulteration and desecration of the Biblical story. Most troubling was the absence of spouses of all three sons of Noah. Reference has been made in my religious education (since early Sunday school) to Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. The film's creator apparently needed to make an ""it's all about me as an artist"" thing.Another HUGE pile of Male Bovine Excrement was the stowaway bad guy on the Ark. After returning home from the film, I dug into whatever sources I could, and find NO reference to a stowaway.I could go on, but the point - I trust - is made.

455,doom-ca,Almost Unwatchable,2,16 July 2014,"Tolerable at best. It seemed with the plot a given that the writers struggled with storyline, that appears to be why there is little to no depth, suspense or watch-ability to this movie at all. I thought Noah would have lots of action with some great special effects, yes it did have special effects, but they can never make up for a weak storyline, weak dialogue and at times very questionable, over the top acting. I was really looking forward to this movie, and received a blunt trauma blow to the head when 20 minutes in, I realized how bad it was going to be. I just wanted to be put to sleep - like the animals on the ark. If you decide to give it a look see, lower your expectations considerably and maybe you'll come out with a ""well it wasn't quite as bad as I thought it would be"" attitude.",Noah
456,vcastilino,Noah chooses God!,8,3 September 2014,"When I began to watch I expected some religious pious drama of God commanding and man obeying. However, what surprised me was the take of the director and the whole story. It depicts Noah and the choices he makes... not what God makes and tells him to do. The movie walks with Noah as he makes decisions, and struggles to live with the consequences of those choices he makes. It shows a man living up to God... not merely God calling a man to do something and God making it all happen.Another aspects of the movie I truly admire is the way, God is depicted. He is NOT shown at all!! All that Noah has is dreams, visions and signs. There is no 'God' appearing to him and 'telling' him in clear cut terms what he ought to do. The only 'strange' phenomenon one gets to see is the Watchers, the unearthly beings which - again - choose to help Noah. The latter part of the movie too is very meaningful. It shows the pain and the desperate measures Noah is challenged to take up to fulfill his mission - he is to end his own progeny and let God begin afresh! All along, God is 'silent'. Today people prefer to believe that believing in God will automatically and 'magically' erase all problems and difficulties in life... that those who believe and trust in God are not supposed to have any difficulties in life. I truly am happy that the movie does not make life easy for Noah, just because God chooses him. It shows truly and honestly how difficult life is for those who choose God!",Noah
457,redwriteandblue,"This film, like the Bible itself, is subject to interpretation ...",7,6 July 2014,"Finally saw the film that had so many Christians wanting to do un- Christian-like things to its creators and star, when it was first released.How was it?I wish I could say for sure; am still thinking on it. I didn't NOT like the film - it's engaging from start to finish, never dull for all its 138 minutes, and I've read a lot of the concerns/issues (via reviews) that those who hated had with it, and had NO problem with the Watchers or how they handled them, or the liberties the filmmakers took with the story ... especially considering that, in the Bible, the story of Noah isn't exactly lengthy or full of detail. Had no issues with the film using the word ""Creator"" instead of ""God"" - uhh, I got who they were talking about - and though much has been said about the fact that Darren Aronofsky (the director and co-writer) is an atheist, I don't outright see where that came across in the film at all (in fact, I thought the film had some very strong things to say about things like faith, how mankind has done its best (through greed and violence and avarice) to destroy the very paradise He bestowed us with, even the complications of following blindly. The performances are solid (except for Logan Lerman, who got on my nerves from his first appearance), special effects well- done and believable (the scenes of the various animals, two by two, boarding the ark alone are worth watching the film for), and Crowe does well even during a time when you think Noah might have taken his faith just a bit over the deep end. I would say, overall, maybe seven stars out of ten. I think the film would have benefited from a cast of lesser-knowns, so that when watching you could have focused on Lila instead of Emma Watson, or say Methuselah instead of Anthony Hopkins (I wonder, sometimes, if this is why I love foreign - especially Asian - cinema so much; without such recognizable actors, it's ever more easier to focus on the characters, and subsequently their story). I also think the ending feels too ""Hollywood""; the film itself has its wonderful moments of darkness, it's gritty ... the ending, not so much, it's closer to the sunshine and bunny farts of the typical Hollywood (almost Disney-esque) ending. Perfect? No. Worth seeing? Most definitely.",Noah
458,tlupejkis,Great Adaptation of Epic Proportions.,8,9 April 2014,"I saw Noah last night. I absolutely loved it. There is TREMENDOUS hate for it on this site, most of it Christian driven (some plot/acting driven, which is fine). The complaints I saw were that it 'did not follow the bible story perfectly'. Of course not- it is an adaptation between the bible, the Book of Enoch and a graphic novel called Noe. It really fleshed out this story that has a lot of 'whys' all by itself.The acting was great. The special effects were incredible as the animals all look real, but were all done digitally. I do study the Bible and it gave me a new understanding of what the character, Noah, went through. It also shows a personal belief of mine that the early humans had great knowledge of plant life, their properties and, perhaps, even a little magic and closeness with 'The Creator'.The visual of 'The Watchers' was right on point. It is what I would have imagined.This is not a Christian story, Christians must note, nor a Jewish story. The earliest version is from the Sumerians, later peoples borrowed it. But I have always said, that doesn't mean it never happened. I was so happy to see this epic adventure. The time had come to do it justice.",Noah

The clothing the people wore seemed just too modern! The metal implements way too advanced for the time.This is just a typical, blatant humanistic hogwash!",Noah

462,JorgeLMC,Details that Scream,3,14 August 2014,"Even if we take into account the successes of ""Noah"", and they are many: good cast, interesting art direction, and daring in extrapolating the best-known biblical canon of the general public, yet is virtually impossible go over some gigantic details that almost completely spoil the newer Darren Aronofsky's treat. Beginning by laughable Stone Giants/Fallen Angels extremely unresolved visual and narratively, through the ridiculous pro-vegetarianism speech, too bad hidden by the script, and that all time arises with the stealth of an elephant. That the production contains at least one passage artistically brilliant - when Noah chronicles the creation of the universe, as we see a simple sequence of images, a dazzling summary of divine work, serves as a sample of the greatness that could have been achieved, if some wrong choices had not contributed so negatively as the final result. Also serves as an incentive to give the film a chance, and thus judge him, by your own eyes.",Noah

464,Like_Wu_told_me,"Fascinating, complex, challenging, and ultimately moving",9,30 March 2014,"Darren Aronofsky's retelling of the classic biblical story is gripping, moving, and extremely complex. The film is brimming with challenging ideas about religion, morality and faith. It touches on themes of environmental degradation, religious zealotry, and the ultimate fallibility and dangers of human interpretation of the Bible and God's will, in a world where God provides no direct commands or even simple communication to the creatures he supposedly loves above all else. The film follows Noah (Russell Crowe), his wife, Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), his three sons, and their adoptive daughter Ela (Emma Watson) as they prepare for the Great Flood, revealed to Noah in visions. The absorbing, fully realized biblical-era world has been drained of resources by sinful descendants of Cain, leaving Noah and his family as the only virtuous humans left. It chronicles the building of the ark to the aftermath of the flood, ending with the reemergence of land and humanity's new beginning, with the help of some stunning visuals, an intelligent script, and interesting performances. However, the story serves as the vehicle for exploring fundamental questions about faith, religion, and the environment. Aronofsky adheres faithfully to the Old Testament morality and worldview, which makes for a fascinating and through-provoking story. While the film doesn't judge the characters for their beliefs and actions, which are simply a product of their time, it does emphasize the inherent fallibility of human interpretations of the Bible and God's will at key moments. For example, toward the end when Naameh pleas that God ""sent what we need"" in the form of twin girls, it falls on Noah's deaf ears, as he is convinced God wants humanity to die off. His stubborn, rigid beliefs call out the absolutist, rigid belief systems of biblical literalists today, as they oppose gay rights and other issues based on their individual interpretations of the Bible and disregard the authentic human experience right in front of them. Adding to the complexity, the ""barbarians"" are not wholly evil or unidentifiable. It's not hard to empathize with the antagonist king, Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) or other men as they search for food and resources for their decaying and starving cities, earnestly asking God ""why won't you converse with me?"" Faith in ""the Creator"" isn't presented in any judgmental way, and it's notable that both the ""innocent"" and ""wicked"" men take belief in the Creator as a given. Still, one empathizes with all the characters as they try to find the balance between serving their creator and struggling to survive, seemingly abandoned in this harsh world. There are no cardboard cutout villains, and as the story shifts to the interpersonal drama on the ark, the lines between good and evil become indecipherable. There are several horrifically grim and darkly heartbreaking moments that cut to the core of our humanity, such as when a girl is horrifically dragged away from her loved one to be eaten by the starving men surrounding her. In another instance, a haunted, abandoned girl, who Noah's son Ham (Logan Lerman) tries to bring to the ark as his wife, steps on a trap and is horrendously trampled in the final push by the men to force their way onto the ark. The final shot of humans being washed away as they desperately cling to the remaining rocks is harrowing, as are their screams heard from inside the ark. These and other moments illustrate the depths of human depravity and offer a truly haunting glimpse into a world depleted of resources. It dovetails with the film's larger statement on the dangers of human environmental degradation, which serves as a cautionary tale for today's science- and climate change-denying politicians and world leaders. Beyond the fascinating central themes of the film's plot and visuals, the performances are strong as well. Russell Crowe grounds Noah with a fierce integrity, loyalty, and love for his family and Creator. The sheer earnestness of his faith perfectly complicates the film's notions of morality. Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone, Emma Watson, and Logan Lerman all provide solid support, although with more limited roles. Anthony Hopkins is also a standout, giving a beautifully poignant, nostalgic, and generally touching performance as Noah's grandfather. In the end, Noah is a film of great power and ambition that everyone, atheists and religious fundamentalists alike, should see for its challenging, thought-provoking themes. It takes a universally recognized fable and mines it for rich ideas and emotions relating to the nature of humanity and our place in the universe, all in the form of a high-budget action film. It challenges religion and faith but affirms the vitality of love and human connections, and for that alone it deserves to be commended.",Noah
465,teodoreh,Such a bad script..,1,30 December 2017,"This is a terrible movie, and there's a reason for that:The director/writer/producer tries to mix religion, fantasy and science.
The outcome is a stupid movie that when it manages not to bore you, it makes you wonder who the hell wrote such a confusing script!On older epic movies like '56 ""The Ten Commandments"" at least there's a theatrical performance that follows the Bible story. In this movie, it's so idiotic to show the Big Bang and try to convince your audience that this is explained in the scripts. Also stupid is a dialogue inside the Arc that tries to pass the message that some species are extincted because they were eaten by some guy.There are some imaginary characters that has nothing to do with the bible, so now you have serious narration of bible combined with absolutely imaginery situations!If the editor had cut all the science references and time-lapses or the out of the bible characters and storylines, this would be at least a 5/10 boring movie for me. But they managed to mix religion with fantasy and science and this makes this movie, a 1/10 plan stupid attempt.",Noah
466,Michael-RGV,Christians Beware!,1,29 March 2014,"After seeing this movie, I could kick myself for not doing some research first. My wife and I heard that there was a movie opening called Noah and thinking this would be similar to The Ten Commandments, we rushed out to see it. Big mistake! I didn't expect it to follow 100% with scripture as there are many blanks to fill in when telling a story from the Old Testament. However, this movie drastically re-wrote scripture. The worst parts were the rock men that looked like transformers and the way they portrayed Noah as a ruthless man intent on carrying out ""the creator's will"" as Noah perceives it. Another issue was that God wasn't mentioned by name in the movie. I could cite dozens more examples, but you get the idea.If you like fiction, you might enjoy this movie. If you want a story that parallels the Bible, then my advice is to stay away.As far as my rating, I gave this rating of 1 Star out of my own belief that if a story is about the Bible and you totally disregard the source, then you should give it a different name that doesn't imply it is Biblical. Using the Bible to draw people in who would otherwise be offended is just plain wrong. Also, there are people out there that never read the Bible who might see this and think that is what the Bible says about these events.",Noah
467,AtariBaby,I thought it was a masterpiece,9,5 July 2014,"It's a flawed masterpiece, but I felt it was a thoughtful and entertaining imagining of the well-known myth. To each their own, I guess.It's not true to any Biblical version I'm aware of, though there are many variations of this story in ancient history. There are points where there is too much explaining going on, and you get that feeling like when you watch the original Hollywood release of ""Blade Runner"", with Harrison Ford's horrible voice-over at the end, that compromises were made and the film had to be dumbed down.It's very different from Aronofsky's other films. But like his other films, it features deeply conflicted and moving characters, brilliantly performed by the actors.But me, personally, I was riveted. I must be a buffoon with bad taste, because I don't know anyone who liked it, besides me.",Noah
468,kyle-domination,"A different film, for the better and worse. Admirable but abominable.",7,27 May 2014,"The film is particularly hard to judge, mainly because it has fantastic moments and some weak moments. Since the entire story of Noah is only told in three chapters in Genesis, it will always be a hard film to make and Darren Aronofsky should certainly be applauded for his brave effort. Directors like Steven Spielberg or Christopher Nolan, I imagine, will say that it would be a hard film to make despite how good they are. Director Darren Aronofsky has made some artistic and powerful films like The Fountain and Requiem For A Dream. He made Black Swan, which was a particular critical favourite. The audience however didn't get the entire film I have heard. He is a fantastic director but I don't think he really suited the project itself but from what he has done, he has done a confident effort in delivering the story of Noah. The combination of Darren Aronofsky and the story of Noah is certainly an evocative one. Aronofsky's films often feel like vivid fever dreams, and it's an intriguing choice for him to tackle this huge biblical tale. Noah, played by the legendary Russell Crowe, is an interesting interpretation. He is good however. Very good in fact but one of the main flaws of the film is about Noah's character: He is depicted as a negative character.Story: The opening (including some text on screen that, essentially, gives you a cliffs notes of the Bible, up to the Noah tale, over some cool Aronofsky visuals) establishes that God, here continually called ""The Creator"", is certainly believed in by most everyone, but also has gone so long without making his presence felt that it's assumed he long ago abandoned or moved on from the people he put on the Earth. In my personal opinion, I didn't like the opening. It's ambitious and audacious, yes, but it is hard to watch and hard to take in the amount of information given to you. It's rushed and since it's rushed, it sadly opens a massive hole in the boat of characterisation. This is one of the film's flaws but as the film's story progresses, it is easily forgivable. Noah who begins to have visions sent to him by the Creator, warning that thanks to humanity's misdeeds, the end is coming, in the form of a great flood. Noah then devises a plan, to build an ark to save the innocent (the animals of the world) and his family. If I continue to offer more exposition, it will spoil the film's story! As a warning for those who will be surprised, expect added material to the story. I find this perfectly necessary to add more elements to the story because, if you do realise, Noah is three chapters long in the Bible. You have to add stuff to make the film entertaining. The added material by Aronofsky is, yes, unexpected, but I thought it was cleverly executed and very necessary. I won't go into too much detail. But as the story progresses, Noah is depicted as a negative character through his intentions and this isn't correct. In the Bible's teachings, Noah was very obedient and respectful. This is shown in the film, yes, but the audience doesn't clearly understand. Noah does things in the film to be obedient and I think the audience won't realise what he is actually doing. This does cause confusion and you need to watch the film to understand. Epic battles take place in the film and this is part of the added material, but it is well done and I think it suits perfectly with the story.Action, FX and Acting: Noah's epic scenes really are epic and Aronofsky's visual intepretation is brilliant. The film involves the telling of how the world was created and beautifully and noticeably blends evolution and the creation of the world without telling false doctrine of the Bible. This involves amazing imagery and artistic visuals to tell the story and is very well executed by the filmmakers. The action is brief but effective. Ray Winstone's villain, Cain, is generic, as you expect, but interesting and sinister. The battle's between Noah's allies and Cain's army are admiring, intense and perfectly assembled and this is one of the positive things about the movie. Noah is inventive, ambitious, brutal and beautiful: a potent mythological epic. But also wilfully challenging, as likely to infuriate as inspire, whether through its unmitigated Old Testament harshness or its eco-message revisionism and the action is part of that. The acting is very, very, very good particularly by rising star Emma Watson as Noah's adopted ""daughter"", not really, and Noah's wife played by Jennifer Connolly. In fact, they are Golden Globe worthy but not quite Oscar worthy. Powerful and affecting performances.Darren Aronofsky and Russell Crowe bring an offbeat, visually exciting version of the story of Noah to the big screen. The lack of characterisation is disappointing and the opening of the film is far fetched and hard to watch. Yes, this does let the film fall but not much. It's religious aspects confuse but this is because Noah is told in a certain way. A polarising way. It's a love or hate film but I did like it. It's phenomenally bold and ambitious, and ends up being, in my opinion, one of the hardest film to make that rightfully succeeds. People may not like it for it's creative, weird method of storytelling but they will like it for its bold effort. A preposterous but endearingly unhinged epic with soul and heart. This is a Noah for the 21st century, one of the most dazzling and unforgettable biblical epics ever put on film. Just go and see it. See for yourself. Verdict = 7.1 out of 10",Noah
469,sriramchandrasekhar,Somehow not there,6,29 March 2014,"Mr. Darren Aronofsky's repute and a retelling of an epic biblical story pulled me to the screen. I was terribly excited to be watching, but maybe I should have not expected so much. After all , Mr. Aronofsky can only take so much artistic liberty in telling a story from the Bible. The second half is a bit of a drag - 10-15 minutes could easily have been snipped to retain the viewer's hold. It's a good film, but probably doesn't do justice to Mr. Aronofsky's talents.On the positive side, the first half visuals and music were breathtaking and the most enjoyable part of the movie. I also liked the message of compassion and mercy towards animals, which seems to be Noah's mission. I hope that message reaches people all over. That would be mission accomplished for the director and his vision.",Noah
470,valsna-885-781431,Disappointing,6,19 July 2014,"I am giving this movie a 6 in thanks' to the great job done by the actors. While I do not wish to downplay the performance of Russel Crowe as the main character Noah (his acting was truly heavy with emotion, indecision and human doubt) or Anthony Hopkins who had more presence in the movie than all the others put together, despite the fact he had the least time on the screen, I've felt like the movie was mostly saved by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly. All the other characters or members of Noah's family were simply not memorable and lacked depth. I believe this is due to the fact that we all know the turmoil experienced by Noah and, thus, it was the stories of these young people who had to live by the decisions of their father and adoptive father respectively that touched me the most. J. Connelly does a wonderful job as the supportive mother and Emma Watson really grew in on me throughout the movie, her own tragedy very touching and her cunning mind being pivotal to the hardest decision Noah had to ever make. However, it was the story of Ham played by Logan Lerman that captivated me the most and made me experience a true roller coaster of emotions and feelings. To me, his performance was the best of all and most surprising, coming from such a young man as I only remember him from the Percy Jackson movies. This was a very different role and I was truly amazed. I believe he was the only character in the movie who had dared to actually question God's will, the essence of human and manhood, the very concepts of innocence and sin... he was also the one to actually say it aloud that the Great Flood had taken the innocents together with the sinners. This was exactly what I was expecting of the movie - the eternal battle of what is right and wrong, the perception that among the evil in this world there is good, too, and that the innocents are mostly buried underneath the sinners, judged and forced to suffer for the sins of others.To my heavy disappointment, Ham was the only character to even come close to these philosophical questions and, truth be told, the most realistic human depiction and the only character I truly felt for during the entire movie. All the others got overshadowed and the actions and decisions made by them were difficult for me to perceive and sympathize with. I grew up in a supportive family and seeing Noah ignore his own children while instead he should have gone and supported them, talked them through, let them make their own decisions, was a truly alien concept. While I understand he had his own battles and was blinded by his heavenly mission, I just could not relate to him.Other than the spectacular acting, I can also applaud some pretty original ideas presented by the directors. I adored the story of the Fallen Angels, I thought it was truly original and those were the characters I rooted the most for. It touched me seeing the heavenly beings punished for their compassion and thrown into mud literally. Also, I give the directors credit for answering the question on how the bloody hell did Noah feed all those animals? I was disappointed though, for the animals were never shown in detail, even though they were the most important beings on that ship. I would have liked to have seen more focus on the different species and animals, especially now that the technology truly allows to bring them to life. Also, the movie lacked what I was expecting the most - how the tragedy touched all those people who had lost their lives. In the end, the directors had doomed the entire world showing only the darkest of humans, as if Noah and his family were the only innocent ones. How about others? The babies? The children? I would have liked to see their stories, even if briefly. This was what I was expecting when I watched the movie but the directors ignored this all together. Also, despite the stunning visuals and effects, I could not help but find certain scenes silly and funny instead of emotional or inspiring. I am not sure what went wrong with the movie in the end, but it was disappointing to me in everything except for a few performances pulled by great actors. If you think this movie will bring forth certain philosophical ideas or try to show how the Great Flood and God's decision to destroy the world had affected all humanity in general, you are wrong. You will only get a story of one man who is too blinded to come close to the true questioning of the Creator's or his own decisions.",Noah
471,matt-mccabebrown,"Either biblical propaganda, or a half decent Fantasy movie",7,5 October 2014,"There is no denying that this is a big budget bible story made for the big screen, which takes massive liberties with the 'subject material'. You can therefore, in my opinion, view this as either Biblical Propaganda, or actually a half decent Fantasy movie with the solid actors. Personally I approached this movie that the latter approach. For me its a work of pure fiction and as I have no strong religious beliefs, I have none to offend and so found a good little movie. The cast is solid, with Crowe, being Crowe frankly. All the support players act well enough, but there's not one performance that makes you think, wow! The film looks and sounds good and is clearly well made. So in a nutshell; If you approach this in the same way you would The Hobbit, I think you'll enjoy it, but if you think you're expecting 'god' to show up on screen and heal the world, you'll hate it",Noah
472,selvatica,Why so negative ?,8,19 September 2017,"I'm perplexed at the loads of negative reviews ( and specially by 'Christians'). I enjoyed the film, and made me read the whole story as written in a Bible I have (edition from 1840.....is this why modern readers say it DIFFERS ? I guess modern/shorter versions are around which simplifly the story leaving out GIANTS and other ancient archetypes ?) Guess what ? It's EXACTLY like the film, including the giants and angels ....I was actually surprised at how literally the director had transcribed it , and I was intrigued by the Bible-story very much. Yes it is almost SF as some say, but not the film, it's just WRITTEN like that. Noah is even more cold then how the actor plays him. And it gives no reason for his all last years of living in total isolation and penitance AFTER they arrive in their new land. Guess what ? Aranofsky took here the only liberty I can see , and did so only to give a psychological reason for the WHY ( Noah sinned of arrogance, since he'd forbidden his children to take their love-interest along , and indeed this is not so loving , he behaved strictly conceptually without compassion as his wife showed him. Anyway, this is the ONLY liberty of the film I encountered. And a good one, because reading the OTestament leaves you wondering indeed ""But WHY did he end up living separated from his family in a cave ???""..............The director showed the relation of that cold decision and the penitence he took for it, which is a good move IMO. And the rest ? You'd be surprised how much 'SF' is to be found in an ancient Bible !! Well done, a deserved 8.",Noah
473,rhhdvh,"Noah, anacronistic chaos, a tossed salad",5,24 April 2014,"My undergraduate degree is in history, my work is global manufacturing technology, and I am a seminary student, besides being an avid reader and a movie goer. An anachronism is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of person(s), events, objects, or customs from different periods of time. The Noah movie narrative and plot didn't follow ""The Book"" and the movie characterizations and settings were in the main using modern and not period norms, so much so that it came across for me as muddled. I am in Seminary and just completed study of Genesis, including the Noah story, our common ancestor. According to my renown professor, the Bible is a bifid, meaning it has two parts. So does the creation story, Genesis 1 and Genesis 8, the ""World that Was,"" and the ""World that Now is."" The before flood plot has five parts: the Creation, Adam, The Fall, Conflict of Seed, and Judgment. The comparative after flood plot five parts are: the New Creation, Noah, the New Adam, The Fall Renewed, Seed Conflict Renewed, and the New Judgment. Just picking the story up with Noah, leaves out the ability to compare the pre-and post-flood stories. Comparison is the basis of human thinking, and is a fundamental biblical message. So, watching the movie was like seeing a half, but not the whole, progressing by walking on one leg, kind of jumping all around. Then, too, the half story is told itself in part, so that for me the movie narrative only vaguely follows the ""Book"", and therefore comes across as a disjointed effort. Added to the plot distraction, was the wide use of anachronisms. There were so many out of place elements, that for me they constantly interrupted the coherence of the movie. For example, the Nephilim. The obscure term best described as ""giant,"" appears but twice in the bible, once in the pre-flood narrative. Yet, in the movie, they become central characters (to sell the action figure rights?) Tubal Cain was a biblical metal worker, but he was not on the arc. And Noah, his three sons and their wives were aboard the arc in the biblical account, except in the movie two wives were missing. The one son's wife got pregnant and miraculously delivered in 40 days (that's how long the arc was on the waters.) Noah wanting to kill his granddaughters was a movie fiction. The movie clothing and implements were all of modern manufacture. There was a modern furnace on the arc, and anesthesia was used to sedate the animals! The new garden vineyard drunkenness ""fall"" takes place at the sea side! All this incoherence left me unsure of what I had experienced. For these reasons, not following the book, and the anachronisms, the movie comes across to me as an olio, a cinematic hodgepodge, a tossed salad.",Noah
474,happycatpaws,A Bible story in creative sci-fi modern format,8,12 September 2014,"I'm giving a high rating because of the creativity of the writers for taking a Bible story and transforming it into a sci-fi format that non-Christian people may actually watch and not reject simply because of the religious premise. It is very clever. It makes an ancient story very appealing to a modern audience as a thriller/action type movie. For that, it is almost a masterpiece and I think they should follow up with other Bible stories in ""modern"" format. It's an exciting translation. Not being a great Bible scholar, I understand that there are fictionalized liberties taken with the story and that is understandable because, after all, it is a movie for entertainment purposes, not meant to be a religious translation. I do think it may lead some people to explore the Bible further and see the redeeming values, the wisdom, enlightening knowledge and fascination it holds, when they maybe have never opened the book. In that aspect, it has a hidden kernel of sparking interest in what could be a transforming lifestyle choice. In that aspect, it is again a masterpiece.

477,worldbarrow,I'd Rather Watch 'Waterworld',2,3 April 2014,"If 'Noah' had not been directed by Darren Aronofsky, I wouldn't have watched it any sooner than 'Clash of the Titans'. Unfortunately, this is Aronofsky's worst film, far worse than 'The Fountain', which might have fared better without the budget like what Paramount greenlit for 'Noah'. The script is not too rich with fake archaism, despite the actors efforts to develop a sense of the ancient period in cautious transatlantic accents, implicitly acknowledging that biblical characters didn't speak any variety of English but the British kind sounds older. The worst aspects of the film predictably involve the liberties taken with the source material, regardless of the sanctity of the texts or the impiety of the interpretation. A large portion of the film is CGI, devoted to animating the 'fallen angels', giant, spidery stone beings that actually seem like a direct rip-off of the Ents from 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. The intervention of crude stone giants might explain, for example, how Noah was capable of building an ark to house two of every living animal, but earthen nature is conspicuously absent from this barren film. Aronofsky should have chosen real settings and a historical take on the ancient story, leaving the element of divine intervention as a premonition, supposing the truth behind the myth might have been an ancient naturalist who weathered a flood, having been possessed to build a boat filled whatever animals he could save. That would have been a quiet, observant film, and not a biblically branded Hollywood spectacle with neither reverence for the myth nor the curiosity about its real origins.

It also keeps all of Aronofsky's usual character dilemmas and perfectness, showing similarities in some takes and shots when Crowe's character appears on camera with other of Darren's movies such as The Wrestler and Black Swan.Personally as a huge Darren Aronofsky's fan, I think is not his best, but that doesn't make it his worst at all, this is a very good project with an amazing cast, and deserves the support of the audience as well as the money of the ticket, recommended.",Noah

As it happens, 'Watchers' are actually mentioned in The Book of Enoch in ancient scripture. This is not a literal interpretation, but part of the genius of the bible is that stories in it can be reanalyzed for all time. I'm also mystified by those who claim it lacks emotion or feeling. I was deeply moved throughout; the animals quietly heading toward the Ark was both heartrending and thrilling. But then you have to love and revere animals which Aronofsky clearly does.

482,kevbowdc,No.... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!,6,3 April 2014,"As a devout Christian and movie lover... I must say that this movie was overall... dreadful. I know my vote of 6 out of 10 seems contradictory, but my rating comes from the visuals and the graphics (which were great). I cannot say the same for the writing and direction of the film. Let it be known that the only truth that I can find from the film in comparison to the Bible is that the lead character's name was Noah and there was a flood. Everything else was a fairy tale and quite jarring. For example, the watchers? I still laugh when I think about those mythical rock creature that were oddly placed in the movie. I understand that Hollywood sometimes has to diverge from the true story to add some more elements, but does that make it right? In this case... no it does not.The main struggle that I had with the film was that it took too long to get to the point. Everyone knows the story of Noah, so just get to the point already. The audience has to sit through tiresome dialog and slow transitions that really hampered the film. Again, the only strengths about this movie were the acting and the visuals. Other than that, I could have waited until this came on TV. (p.s. my great friend treated me to this movie so I am not too upset.) Finally, as a Christian I won't say that I am offended by the made up fluff that soured the story but it just goes to show that the true living word of God is what has the power. God's book has stood the test of times, so why try to change it? Aronofsky really disappointed me with this one and I was a fan of Black Swan and The Wrestler. This has been a great year where a lot of Christian films are being released at the box office. This film is only a major roadblock from the message that should be spread across the world.",Noah
483,Derekrusselpurvis,It's a good idea to read the Bible before making a Bible movie.,6,4 June 2014,"Spoiler alert!!!! Very exciting and dramatic story, but for the Bible scholar it will be irritating unless you can convince yourself as I did that it is a completely different story apart from the Biblical account of Noah. Anyone claiming it is accurate needs to read up on it before posing a review. Yes there were fallen angels in the Bible, but NO they did not help the children of Cain build a city and then get attacked and slowly killed off by the humans. The movie gets an A on creativity, but an F on accuracy. Fallen angels in the Bible also did not fall because God was punishing them for helping humans, but were cast out because they had pledged their loyalty to satin rather than God. So in other words, the movie makes it seem as if Satin's angels were just misunderstood victims that wanted to show mercy. COMPLETELY OFF Then there is the notion that God left it up to Noah to choose if mankind would continue or be destroyed. In the Bible God tells Noah that he wants him to replenish the earth from the very beginning. In the film God is projected as some merciless jerk who just wants Noah to save the animals and then die with his family causing the human race to be extinct. This also makes Noah appear to be a mad man and is willing to kill newborn children so he doesn't ""fail"" God. Again... WAY OFFthere are a lot of Very unnecessary unrealistic aspects in the film which made the story beyond unbelievable. I can't understand why they chose to go so far from the Bible, the true story is far more entertaining and beautiful. Nothing is more amazing than the truth. I understand that you need to add a Hollywood aspect to the film as was done with ""One Night With The King"" and ""Passion"", but they went way off-road in this movie.I wish it would have given a better view on the wickedness of man, and how perverted the people were. The audience is left in the dark in a large portion of the film. But as I said in the start of my review, a entertaining movie when you remove the Biblical accuracy from the mix. Emma Watson was spot on with her part as always. Russel Crow captured what the film needed in his character.Some parts I have a hard time getting over, like the girl in the trap part near the end... Poor Ham...I could go on about the accuracy of the film, but I recommend it despite the fact. Just keep in mind that this is a very highly dramatized version for pure entertainment, and these people are competing with Godzilla for peek sakes. I hope a real Noah movie is made someday. Beautiful acting in this film, hate to see all their hard work go unappreciated. Go watch it, enjoy it, and have a nice day.",Noah

I'm an atheist but I was seriously considering bending my knees and praying to God to poke out my eyes... And if only the horrible CGI was the problem, but no...

On that note, someone please tell me why are the actors act like they're in the 20s century. They are not.

485,Lesego-Madisa,A Wonder to Watch but A Few Things Ruined It...,6,21 January 2015,First and foremost the movie had a lot of historical inaccuracies. God or His Supreme presence was absent in the movie. Noah doesn't even get a warning from a Superior Being.All he gets is a premonition through a dream about a flood. I won't lie it was nice to see this type of creativity in the film but it is still unjustified and unwelcome.Had God been cast in the film it would make him the Antagonist because He would be the one bringing upon the deluge as means to cleanse the earth.They made Noah selfish and unkind because he didn't warn people around about an incoming flood so we could have seen them mock him.Hollywood filmmakers do not believe in God because they are desperately trying to justify all the events they depict in these modern movies.Once the flood came it was my happiest moment ever and the sound at the theater was ear deafening!!! The producers of the film challenged the good book as much as they can probably because they felt that the 'First & Original Draft' was a bit dry. I did not like the fallen angels part because they seemed to be in the wrong movie. Molten Rocks?? Really?? They really could have done better.Emma Watson giving birth was heart stopping because she did a brilliant performance.Superb visuals but lacks the most important aspects.,Noah

That didn't bother me. What bothered me was the complete 180 of what the trailers for this film masterfully and deliberately left out. The watchers.OMG and WTF? Rebellious angels turned rock monsters? Weren't rebellious angels called demons? Anyway, there they were, these improbable creatures (who looked improbable too, with an animation that would make Ray Harryhausen cringe)helping Noah). In fact, the rock angels weren't the only bad effect. The serpent in the garden looked absurdly phony.The trailer made the film look like a dramatic survival film, and what we got was a vegan and his family on the run from progress.

487,legspinner,"an anagram of Noah is ""Ah, No!""",3,15 April 2014,"not promising. It looks as if it's going to be something quite clever, but by the time it's imported the centrepiece of a race of deep-talking monsters made of stone, you know something is afoot. Anything mildly interesting is given in exposition, so the writers can concentrate on anything banal, fantastical, tensionless, or pretentious, and so the film it should have been is lost forever. Even Ray Winstone can't bear to get out of first gear for his role, and Russell Crowe does what he can to wreak moments of great pathos (where he welcomes critters into the ark, for example). The chief question associated with this film is, however, which fourth-former wrote it, and has he also remembered to do his maths prep?Since I wrote this review, it's been brought to my attention that the deep-talking monsters are the Nephilim, but that doesn't change my objections. They're done cheaply and badly, in that case, because, as has been noted, it is ""Transformers,"" all over again. I've read reviews which say the film portrays deep moments of spiritual experience, and that is true. It does. Noah on the ship comes to a moment where he and God exchange views on the flood, and God calls off the rain as soon as Noah says a particularly important line - and the acting at that moment is terrific. My point is not that this is full of fantasy. My point is not even that a so-called 'uplifting' story is taken and turned dark. My point is this film is cynical. It has been put together by people who are pleased to have been left in the position of being able to express themselves through film, and as a result, it is flippant with its audience, crammed full of learning it doesn't understand and can't process, and so ruinously bad, even its stars can't find any way to play off each other. Russell Crowe acts well, yes, but in a vacuum. There are touches of good acting from Emma Watson, but Jennifer Connelly is given so many head-shots (count the head-shots in the entire movie if you want to know what bad direction is) you're bored of her, and don't sympathise with her dilemma. You don't sympathise with anyone's dilemma in this film. Not the cinema who show it, not the people who made it, not their desperate intentions. Only your fellow audience members. So there we are. This film does God's job, by default, and brings people together into a state whereby they can sympathise just that little more with their fellow cinemagoer and money-spender.",Noah

492,arenn,"Bad, But More Redeeming Elements Than Most Reviews Suggest",4,6 April 2014,"This movie isn't very good for reasons many have already said. But I'd like to highlight some things Noah got right from a Biblical perspective that I didn't see mentioned.1. Contrary to what some are posting, the Biblical Noah was not a good man who deserved to live. Though highly lauded and touted as ""blameless"", looking at the totality of scripture this clearly doesn't mean he's sin free. Indeed, the Bible is elsewhere clear that ""All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."" The drunkenness episode in the Bible shows Noah wasn't perfect. Rather, the Bible says ""Noah found favor with God"" which can be seen as a type of sovereign grace. And Noah ""walked with God"" showing that he continued in his pursuit of God despite any failings - the same thing we are called to do despite our own sins.2. Noah in this light is correct that all men deserved to be destroyed via God's justice. His revelation of his own sin nature is a prerequisite for understanding his need (and ours) for God's grace. Where Noah goes wrong is that he assumes God must actually want him and his family dead. It never occurs to Noah that God might spare the wicked in his grace. Thus the film Noah's main error is his failure to understand God's gracious nature. As the Bible says, ""God is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness"" and ""If you marked iniquities, O Lord who could stand? But there is forgiveness with Thee that Thou mayest be feared."" This is where Noah goes wrong.3. Although the fallen angels are clearly not Biblical, they illustrate the breakthrough that Noah doesn't make. When their leader asks God to forgive him, he's immediately set free of his prison and brought back to union with the Creator. This is what God wants, our repentance and seeking of his pardon, not to kill off all sinners (i.e., everybody). Note that as with the Bible, God's grace in this case is granted without conditions and without merit. (I'll admit the clear implication in the film is that by aiding Noah, the Watchers atoned for their own sin, however, which is not a Biblical notion). Think of Jesus story of the tax collector going into the temple to beat his breast begging God ""Have mercy on me, a sinner"" and coming away forgiven. Or how both Judas and Peter betrayed Jesus. The difference was in how they reacted afterwards.4. By failing to understand God's gracious character, the film Noah goes horribly off the rails. He also erroneously assumes God's provision will take a specific form (wives for his other two sons). And when his expectations aren't met, this reinforces his misreading of God's intent. He has faith, but as Paul puts it in Romans, ""not according to knowledge."" This leads him to believe God must want him to commit horrible acts of which God might say, as he actually did at one point in the Bible, ""They cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I had not commanded them nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination."" (Jeremiah 32:35). Also, unbeknowst to Noah, the evil bad guy had sneaked onto the ark. Nevertheless, God's plan of saving humanity succeeded, not because of Noah's choice, but because of God's sovereignty. Thus this film illustrates the sovereignty not of man, but God, whose will is done despite Noah's blunders and despite the bad guy's deliberate attempt to subvert it. ""Many are the plans of a man, but the purpose of the Lord will stand."" (Proverbs 19:21).5. Ham's unwillingness to forgive his father dooms him to permanently alienated relationships and the end of his line. He and Japeth are very young and possibly could have married the twin daughters (albeit with a bit of an age gap and some icky incest, which was inevitable even in the Bible version). In effect, God did provide the potential for wives for the other sons, but Ham missed out on who knows what kind of blessings because of his inability to forgive. Another Biblical and human lesson to learn.So while this is hardly an accurate Bible story and was a dreadful movie in many ways, there were more real Biblical principles at work in it than perhaps even Aronofsky is aware.",Noah

This movie shows what's wrong with a lot of movies to date. Filled with mediocre cgi, a reheated story, just equipped with more violence and sex than needed...oh ye, and monsters of course! I don't say that sex, violence and monsters aren't any nice, but they don't make for a good movie ""anymore""! In case of Aronofski, who really did create some masterpieces, ""Noah"" is weak.

Perhaps Darren Aronfsky should join James Cameron in remedial screen writing class or HIRE A SCREENWRITER!!! Production design and art direction--Academy Award for Bottom of the Barrel with clunky mismatched styles that said little other than ""eyesore."" Thematically obvious and banal, it violates the original dramatic sin of giving more answers than questions, and does so by taking us on a painfully meandering and lurching journey. Only redeeming factor: Top performance by Anthony Hopkins is too little to be of any real help. Hard to believe this is the same director who brought us ""Pi"" ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan.""",Noah
495,edward-grabczewski,A nice retelling of the Noah story,10,4 August 2014,"I watched this movie with my wife and we both enjoyed in enormously. It was a very interesting retelling of the Noah story that brought home some of the anguish of all those involved in this tragic tale of destruction. We were very engaged with the story from the start, which was told sensitively and emotionally, especially towards the end. I loved Noah's version of the Bible creation story and I found all the actors well chosen for their parts. Russell Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Noah. Emma Watson breaks free of her Harry Potter chains to give a credible performance as Ila. One of the most touching scenes towards the end of the film involves these two actors. The film is slow paced, which I love, and the storytelling by Darren Aronofsky is just my cup of tea. I cautiously watched this film on Amazon Prime because I wasn't sure if I would like it. Now that I've seen the film then I will definitely buy it on Blu-ray and it will be added to my special reserve of top-notch films that I will love to watch again in years to come.My enjoyment of this film was only marred by having read so many negative reviews. As I watched it then I kept thinking of some of the comments I had read. I simply cannot fathom how this film has created so much negative criticism. I feel so sorry for the director and all the actors and technicians who put so much effort into making this film the success that it really is. This film more than any other proves to me that I cannot accept the judgement of others when evaluating a film; I am so glad I ignored the reviews and experienced the film for myself.",Noah

499,enekaith,Should have been better,6,29 March 2014,"Now this movie is based on the biblical story of Noah, as much as i understood their viewpoint in trying to entertain the audience with all the cinematography, which they accomplished, they twisted the story of Noah to their own benefit by making Ham seem more inclined towards the behaviour of Cain rather than following the bible that never depicted Ham as such. last I remember, ALL Noah's sons had wives before they even entered the ark. Maybe they just did this to leave room for a saga or something...well good luck with that.I am a firm believer and as i have read the bible with an imaginative mind, this movie did surpass my imaginations by creating a good scenery for the story, and the creative ways they brought in the dove search for land as well as the final words of Noah: 'and so i say to you, be fruitful and multiply' was great. All in all, the movie was just slightly above average. it would have been better if they did not twist the story so much for entertainment. Everyone knows the story already, the watchers were a great addition, the visions Noah received were amazing on screen, but the 'Ham thing'... that should have been erased.",Noah
500,jrodway,Simply Not Very Good,3,30 April 2015,"Let's start with the big question and that's the Biblical basis to this movie. Noah claims to be ""inspired"" by the story in the Old Testament. Outside of some of the characters names, a flood, a boat and animals, the movie really has nothing to do with the story found in Genesis. Frankly I'm not sure the writer/director even used the characters names other than as a marketing ploy. This is not a Christian/Jewish movie. Forget all that you know of the Bible/Torah. It is Noah in name only.The bigger problem is the movie just isn't very good. The story is all over the place and often boring. The dialog is silly, forced and does little to move the narrative. The scenes with the Transformers are, well, laughable, literally. Even the special effects, while big, are not all that great. I expected more.The biggest positive is, at times, the movie seems almost epic. That also hurts it because this movie is far from epic. Much of it feels like a low budget film that had access to a special effects lab. You have to wonder if the director/writer would have done better on a lower budget and not even tried to tie it to Noah. Russell Crowe is okay. His performance does make you miss when he did more than play the same character (ie Gladiator) in various historical settings. Remember amazing movies like The Insider, LA Confidential and A Beautiful Mind??? For a time he was one of the greats. Now I fear he's either been really typecast or is just mailing it in.It's tough to judge Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson's performances because their characters were written so poorly I'm not sure what they could have done. Sir Anthony Hopkins' part as Yoda was silly. Ray Winstone looks like he belongs in Battlefield Earth and is about as compelling.The shame is, even without making it ""too Christian"" if that was the director's concern, the Biblical tale of Noah is so rich with story telling potential and yet it's wasted every opportunity. Exploring the elements of good and evil, morality, faith in what would be impossible to believe, life in those times, etc could have been explored and fascinating. Yes the Biblical story itself is short, there's plenty without the need of making up or changing what was written. For some reason this opportunity was missed. Again, why make it at all.My recommendation against watching this movie is less due to the lack of Biblical/Torah authenticity in the movie but sadly because it's just not very good. What a waste.",Noah

502,jon1410,Successful attempt to realise a creation myth,9,7 February 2015,"God cannot be depicted in film as it would lead to a situation ripe for satire or sacrilege.It would be a mockery.The story of Noah in Genesis is based upon a Babylonian myth which is depicted in the Epic of Gilgamesh,an ancient tale of the deluge by which in early human history the gods sought to destroy mankind.There maybe a historical basis,but this is a fable about man's sinfulness making God seek to create a new man,who alone with his family survives the flood,but to do this all other human beings are destroyed.God's generosity makes a new start possible.On top of this there is always a lot of problems from religious groups about depictions of the Bible,depictions of God etc.Aronosky,a professed atheist,wants a more neutral term like Creator,because at that time there were no words for God,and the story can be viewed,like lots of stories in Genesis as mythological,pre-religious,parables, the nature of God,man and the universe.However,with our current concern for the ecology of the planet,global warming etc, the term 'Creator'(a projection of the past as well as the future) raises the idea of an invisible spirit behind creation.Aronosky didn't want to show a man hearing voices or in dialogue with God.Instead he creates a SF world that could also be the future with a race of rock-titans straight out of Lord of the Rings or Transformers.I think this art-house director is to be applauded for attempting to realise this story of a Bible legend,without falling flat on his face.This Noah(Russell Crowe) has dreams of an almighty flood.Through this he is fore-warned to build a big boat,and in that he was to save himself,his wife,Naameh (Connelly),his children,Shem,Ham and Japeth,and the orphan Ila(Emma Watson) and pairs of all living animals and creatures.This is epic film-making based on an epic story.Crowe's presence is muscular,broody and tormented,a struggling survivor who is obedient to the Creator,though setting harsh limits on his kin.Crowe anchors the film's wilder elements,in a dark,nightmarish vision of the Old Testament.The 6-armed stone giants need a leap of faith to be accepted,rebel fallen angels, who've plummeted from the firmament into hot lava and come to assume crusty rocky exteriors of a Quasimodo-like form.They are needed to haul timber,assemble the ark and defend Noah's project against the armies of Tubal-Cain(Winstone),who killed Lamech, Noah's father.Methuselah,Noah's grandfather, is played rummly by Anthony Hopkins.As Ila is barren she can't have children,but Naameh asks Methuselah for help,and he transforms Ila into a young woman able to beget.Shem finds a partner in Ila,but Ham becomes resentful when Noah allows the girl he likes to be killed by a stampeding crowd.Tubal-Cain stows away on board,helped by the rebellious Ham. What is harder to believe is the way the multitude of animals allow themselves to be lulled asleep for the duration of the ark's voyage by incense.The gloomy interiors of the boat's hulking,pitched timbers suggest the visionary intensity of a creation myth.Connelly is very effective as Noah's wife(having played well with him in A Beautiful Mind),and Emma Watson is superb as a woman fated to repopulate the earth,who has twins,but who has been told by Noah he has to slaughter those children to stop humanity rising again and destroying the earth.They both introduce more flexible elements to the stern patriarch of Noah.Aronosky has shown a Noah-like belief that making a movie is like building an ark,by reinventing biblical cinema for a digital age. Crowe as ever fulfils the promise he made with The Insider and Gladiator.",Noah

I'll start by saying, I went into this movie with an open mind knowing that Darren Aronofsky wanted to reach a wider audience. But he missed the mark on reaching anyone with even the most basic knowledge of the biblical story of Noah. There was an Ark, there was a guy named Noah, there were animals loaded on the ark & there was a flood. Other than that it has nothing to do with the bible. There is no God, there is the Creator, God is never mentioned in the whole movie. I mean the dumbest ideas for a Noah movie; Giant multi-armed rock creatures? A forest instantly pops out of the volcanic soil to provide the wood? A metal working guy using a welders helmet? Noah goes to kill his grandchildren so that 'man' can no longer go on, thus allowing creation to continue without man? Well, why not kill his daughter-in-law so that she can't bear anymore children? This could of been one of the best movies ever, religious or not. But instead it turns into a CGI fest with plot holes all over.

Russell Crowe does a fairly good job as Noah, but the rest of his family make one wonder why God bothered to save them from the flood at all. Noah didn't seem to do any collecting of the pairs of animals required for the Ark; they just embarked like passengers going on a cruise. The whole atmosphere of the movie is gloomy and sombre, and even though the weather was obviously bad during the rains, the beginning of the film is no different. The dialogue is slow and laboured, and really does nothing to give the story a nice and even flow. The 'watchers' - quite a big joke really, they look exactly like transformers made out of rocks.

506,kidjoojoo2002,Disappointing for such talented cast and crew,2,24 August 2014,"I looked forward to watching Noah! It's rare you see a director like Darren Aronofsky work on a project that can attract every culture and every religion. But the storyline was flawed, the visual effects was cheap and the acting and directing were only OK. That's disappointing considering the cast and crew who worked on this film. I'm not criticizing on behalf of a Muslim, who believes in a different kind of story about Noah -peace be upon him-, No! I'm criticizing on behalf of someone who loves films and the least she expected was good visual effects, directing and acting.If I wanted to see the story I have heard about Noah, from when I was a child, it would be like this : Noah lived for 900 years. He had 5 Boys. Shem was the eldest (who became a prophet after his father and the line of prophets came from him until it reached Abraham, Issac, Jacob, Joseph, and ... ). The first 300 years of his life he guided people to believe in God. Sometimes the people beat him so hard (and he wouldn't fight back) that he had to crawl away from them. The second 300 years he started planting trees and making the Arc and gathering the animals and his followers (One of his sons was among the non-believers). the third 300 years came the rain and water that cleansed the earth from non-believers (Noah's son included). There was no fallen angel! There was no fight to capture the Ark by people, Because they believed Noah to be wrong (they often made fun of him for making a big Ark in the middle of dry land, believing their doom was never to come). And most important of all, there were people, other than Noah's family on the Ark.",Noah
507,lizzygokues,Pretty Great,8,14 September 2020,"Don't get the hate for starters. I imagine its because this movie can be polarizing depending on religious views but has a fair amount of action and drama. We all know this biblical story. Painted on our childrens' bedroom walls, crafted into music boxes, even interesting spin offs. This immediately gives some flesh and bone to Noah. Not an absolute hero either. Sort of the anti-hero. A man more than anything. Doesn't know exactly what to do but trusting in himself, his family, and the Creator. Great performances from the likes of Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins, Russell Crowe, Emma Watson, and Logan Lerman. The movie gives us that timeless feeling, and unique cinematography only from Aronofsky, with gnostic and evolutionist views thrown in the mix, to create a beautiful film. Even the Watchers (which are apparently in the bible? who knew?) are delightful to watch and enjoy. A great adaptation to a very minimalistic story.",Noah

Can't believe this is the same director who did PI, and the wrestler. Bad script, talking rocks, some magic gold, Hannibal Lector and berries!! Seriously though, it's a cgi movie... That's it. There was so much room for character development, and yet the characters were completely empty.Stay home, Netflix Pi or requiem for a dream or the wrestler. These are truly great movies that will stand up to the test of time where as Noah will be on AMC as monthly filler! I should have gone to see the Muppet's instead.",Noah
509,JohnPaulG07,Highly inaccurate to the actual book of Genesis.,5,3 April 2014,Highly inaccurate to the actual book of Genisis. Russel Crowe does a half job of representing one of the most famous stories from the bible. The film does come action packed with a few disturbing scenes which may not be suitable for young children. Jennifer does an excellent job playing an emotionally distraught woman which she no doubt has been type casted for. Her range in the film is excellent and really shines through during the end part of the film which due to spoilers I cannot mention. As a whole the film gives a lord of the rings -esque feel to a watered down version of the biblical story. If you are looking for a film that stays to biblical roots such as Ben Hur or The 10 Commandments with modern cgi and great acting you will disappointed. If you are looking for a weekend flick to watch on a date you might find your self minimally entertained.,Noah
510,movieexpert2001,"worst movie in the world, it is abominable and atrociously obnoxcious",1,24 March 2020,"Jesus christ what were they all thinking this movie is terrible garbage, everything about this is bad, it is basically about the bible of how god wiped out the earth, and it starts out with Noah played by Russell Crowe with his family visiting his grandfather played by Anthony Hopkins who plans to plant a seed in the earth. and later the plot gets all pointless and stupid they then meet a young girl ilha played by Emma Watson and they make her part of the family but why would they do that, that is stupid cause you don't just let a non family become a relative unless he or she marries one of the family members but she didn't do that until later when she meets one of the sons, and then the group meets tubal cain played by ray Winstone he then threatens noah and tells him that he and his men will take the ark, it all goes into an unemotional melodrama nothing in this movie is convincing it is beyond bad and then the other members of the family who are Shem (Douglas booth), ham (Logan Lerman) Naahmeh ( Jennifer Connolly , Methuselah (anthony hopkins) and Ilah ( Emma Watson) all of them did a terrible job in portraying their charachters, and again as you see their names are Methusellah, Ham, Shem, Ilha, Naahmeh, and tubal cain, really?? what kind of stupid names are those they are all dumb and all of that stuff is only better in a book, it is unacceptable as a movie, This film also has scenes where things get washed up on land and they climb to get on the garden of eden where adam and eve meet many viewers have mentioned about this in this god awful atrocity, and that is how they criticize the film and now how do you criticize aronofsky's directing well lets count the ways , what he put in this movie was nonsensical ,he was not filling in any blanks to the story he was just butchering it, making as if it was a bad tale and it shouldn't have been made. the movie itself shouldn't have been made and aronofsky actually thought it was a good idea? , well he thought wrong it was a bad idea to write the movie and make it, it was a very bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad idea. and people who see this can actually think it is real and that it will happen in the future, what he has done is endanger all of us, and therefore it makes people nervous and go crazy like in chicken little when he said the sky is falling and we are all going to be taken over. making this was a mistake and all the blame goes to aronofsy and handel shame on both of you you are by making this biggest insult, yes this movie is a gigantic insult to the world , it is a disgrace to the film industry and a complete waste of actor's talent, the stupidest part is where they put ugly rock monsters in the movie, really?? rock monsters, this is stupid, my god , this movie is ugly, and as you see those rock monsters are supposed to be those fallen angels from the book also known as the watchers , but in the book they were not monsters they were angels in the sky and if they are called watchers they are supposed to be staying in the sky and watching us not falling to the ground and turning into rock monsters with octopus arms and sunlight inside them. and guess what they hate everybody else except noah and his family and they help them build the ark this was not in the book, it is all done pointlessly and poorly written it is not interesting ,it is not meaningful, and it is meaningless , dumb , idiotic, appalling , and nonsensical, the editing is bad, and the script is atrociously done, what aronofsky is trying to tell us is that it is ok to be a satan worshiper but it is not, no other movie director would make this colossal abomination and disrespect god, and when you see the shots made and the designs looking bad all you see is just fake pieces of clothing being worn all rotten and old. the costume designs are bad. then comes the scene were the rain starts and the flood begins and before that the remaining men and cain try to get to the ark but those stupid , ugly and abominable rock monsters just smash their faces and wigle their noodeley octupus arms at them from surviving and when they move and wigle their arms around it all looks fake, the special effects were poorly done, and the landscape in the movie didn't look real it just looked like a display of a small artificial land that is shown in a museum. the ark also looked poorly depicted , it just looks like a bunch of large plastic logs put togeather like giant shipping artifacts, then cain survives and joins the family on the ark , and that it actually shows noah's sons having wives and they have no chemistry with them at all and they fail to survive thanks to noah who has done nothing but angered his whole family and like his wife said he will be hated by all the ones he loved, seriously this is the worst storyline and script ever i hate how this movie has bad characters and especially how russell crowe portrayed noah himself he did it all to poorly , all the flooding was all done wrong , and not to mention that emma watson has a baby in this with douglas booth whom she has zero chemistry with, her baby bump looks fake , she doesn't even look like she is pregnant at all she looks like she just put a box under her shirt , then it ends up with noah attempting to kill her newborn daughters but he doesn't , she was very annoying in this mess screaming like crazy, and it fails to be melodramatic , it is not thought provoking and it is meaningless. bad, sad and painfully awful things happen to the characters but you don't even feel sorry for them. and how did aronofsky decide to make this abomination he should be ashamed of himself dont get me wrong he is a very interesting director he makes really good indie films but here he was miscast as director here i dont buy him as a director for making big budget epic movies at all and whats worse is he worked with a horrible screenwriter who is ari handel he cannot write and it is a shame that a very talented indie director who became so distinguished to cinema is working with a horrible writer who cannot write aronofsky should stick to making indie films with weird premises and thought provoking ideas. but if this is what he will do for the rest of his career he will become the next ed wood of this generation. final grade score F",Noah

 Watching Noah, I felt a flood of emotions wash over me, like a tide pulling me this way and that in a great tempest. I really wanted to love this film, but I almost ran screaming like someone abandoning a sinking ship. Not to rain on the parade of those who loved it, but this story simply had no believable arc to it. It seemed like a vast ocean separated me from the folks whom poured a torrent of praise upon Noah. Feeling like I could be missing something, I was compelled to return to the theater for 40 days and 40 nights, but ultimately realized it was a total wash. I'll never get that 100 hours of my life back!",Noah
512,cake-26,Ignore the fundamentalist block vote,10,5 April 2014,"I just wanted to write a positive review about this great movie, to try to redress, in small part, all of the undeserved bad reviews by religious folk. Even most non-religious people have criticised elements of the movie which don't deserve it, in my opinion, eg. some 'characters' don't specifically appear, in detail, in the Bible story, but the movie explained them in a fairly plausible and interesting way I thought, which added to the story. 'Plausible'?. Remember we're talking about God here, so I mean it's plausible in the context of that kind of thing. Also, they have a basis in the bible and other apocryphal writings, although it is a quite fanciful interpretation of what's written there. That's the point that most of the critics aren't allowing for. It's an interpretation of the bible story. I know that fundamentalists don't allow for interpretation, so they are obviously gonna be unhappy about it, but educated, free-thinking people, should understand that written accounts of events rarely contain the truth and never the whole truth, even if you accept that such an event even really happen historically, which itself is very doubtful. So, unless the movie is only 20 minutes long, you gotta fill in lots of missing pieces right? The writer/director does a great job filling in the pieces, to make a great and coherent story. Adding a plot twist, concerning the surviving personnel, makes it much more interesting for a modern day intelligent adult, adding levels of meaning, which should reinforce faith, not deny it. As a movie, it's actually better than the Bible story, which is so simplistic, it should only be taken seriously by children, unless, of course, you have faith, then it's OK for adults too. Controversial things are usually the best and most important things and 'Noah' is a firm example. Besides the controversy, it looks great, has great actors and is very entertaining if you're interested in this subject matter.",Noah

Please, DO NOT GIVE ANY MORE MONEY TO THESE LOSERS.I should also note that I am a former Christian who, because of bad experiences with churches, has returned to being an Agnostic. However, I still stand against the assault that Hollywood mounts on some religions (Christianity) while avoiding others (islam). If you think I am full of it, the movie 2012 purposely did not show the destruction of Mecca or Medina. However, the statue of Jesus in South America was fair game. Hypocrites - ALL OF THEM.

514,david_r_fry,John Carter builds and Ark and changes his name to Noah,4,29 March 2014,"I was actually entertained by John Carter, so don't be fooled by the title of this review. The high point of the movie for me was when one of the Golem says ""When God rains it pours."" The acting, dialogue, special effects, and pacing were all above average but nothing special, but the plot was to put it mildly, confusing, internally nonsensical, and contained too many pointless deviations from the Biblical story and Jewish traditions, and not enough more useful deviations. For example, there isn't any way the movie explains how the human survivors of the flood on the Ark were going to ""be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth"" without a whole lot of incense and inbreeding going on. Couldn't Aronofsky have made this part of the story a little less yucky.",Noah

This movie shows only stone goblins and rebels, without any circumstances arising outside. I think the graphics and effects are very lame and boring because they does not involve a complete fundamental role of each character or Noah's family. This movie could have been better if they have considered seriously these factors. 1) Special effects for animals. Animals can create a complete different environmental scene in the movie. Which can also give interest for children. 2) Stone goblins are not that interesting. Instead if he would have created natural storm and sufferings of the people living outside the ark, that would have been more interesting.",Noah

This movie was as bad as what people told me. It started off pretty good, the location, the direction and everything else seemed pretty thought out. Then it dragged along between Noah the father, Noah the guardian, Noah the ???? - I don't remember how many Noahs I had to deal with in this movie, it wasn't really a coherent movie. I think I enjoyed ""Evan Almighty"" more than this one. It's passable until the time he starts building the ark but its just a rapid erosion after that. The writers were confused where to go after the ark was built so put in too many angles that confused everyone. Please do not waste your time on it, Russell Crowe is such a brilliant actor but even he can't save it and I don't want people to start hating him after this movie.",Noah

But I was amazed at the director's solutions, both visual and conceptual. The dialogs are perfect, each word is weighted and is heavy as rock. I watched the film with single breath unable to move my eyes away from the screen. The mini-story of the creation and stop-motion technique used in the film are both superbly executed. But in the end, its all about the philosophy, the tragedy of human kind - the two opposing outlooks on life clash on screen and force the viewer to ask himself - which side is he on? Respect.",Noah
518,beautox,A flood should wash this bomb out of the theater,2,31 March 2014,"You know how the studios tailor the preview of other movies to fit the demographic and likes of the people in the audience? Well at the showing of Noah (it might have well been called Bill or George) we attended, there were trailers for Spiderman, Transformers, and some other been-there-done-that CGI opus. So right there, I knew this movie would have little to do with the Biblical character of Noah, and instead be another cookie cutter superhero movie designed to spend a zillion dollars and show the world how cleaver the film makers are. And then the film started, and my soothsayer abilities were confirmed. Nothing is more irritating than for a film maker to take a classic tale or movie, and then egotistically thinking they can improve it with gimmicks, a currently camp message, and of course the afore mentioned special effects. And that is exactly what Aronofsky does and fails miserably. Think A Star Trek kumbaya message coupled with loud booms and you've got this movie's modus operandi. So if you think you're going to get a retelling of the Bible story, even a telling with dramatic license, you'll be disappointed; if you just want mindless special effects, you will be happy; and if you want those special effects coupled to a trite and silly narrative, you'll be in heaven!",Noah
519,miles670,A religion hatin' atheists review,8,6 July 2014,"I had to write this review because I came to IMDb to see what others thought of the movie and there was hate everywhere. I didn't expect to enjoy this at all especially after seeing all the negatives reviews being given for it. In truth it's pretty brilliant. The effects are good, the story is good and you feel noahs pain throughout. I don't know how accurate it is concerning the original story but who cares it's just a story. The acting is typical of crowe and hermione I guess but it's good. If you get a chance to watch this I don't think you'll regret it, I certainly don't.I can only presume that all the bad reviews are Christian trolls or something like that because thinking back to what they said none of it seems accurate, it isn't packed full of 'filler' as people have said and it sure as hell isn't boring.The characters are much more complex than you'd expect from the noahs ark tale but I love it. I am very impressed by this, shocked at how well it's done tbh. It isn't fundamentalist in any way and in fact there are scenes that show evolution in some very pretty detail.I can see why Hermione said she doesn't think we should be able to tell whether it's set in the past or future, it's really clever how they've done it but I don't want to include any spoilers so I'll just say watch and form your own opinion. I think it's in the future, but I could be wrong I think the director leaves it up to us to decide xD Really good. Watch it and review it if you've got the time, can't be letting these religious cry babies sully a decent movies name.",Noah
520,Pstitzinger-171-775066,Not One of Aranofsky's Best,5,2 April 2014,"I am a big fan of Darren Aronofsky's work, but Noah just did not hold up to the likes of Black Swan, The Wrestler, or Requiem for a Dream. As in most Aronofsky films, there is the usual internal conflict of the main character having some psychotic episode that puts the protagonist at a struggle, but unlike the struggles presented in his earlier films, I found myself at some points actually losing support for the protagonist. The character development of Noah just seemed too uneven and there are moments where the style of character that Noah had become, or at least seemed to become, I think should have put him at odds more with The Creator vs himself than anything or anyone else. Also, especially for a third time collaboration, I thought the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly could have been stronger. They were more believable as Mr. And Mrs. Nash respectively (A Beautiful Mind). Other than that, it wasn't a bad film. I thought the sets, special effects, and cinematography were very good, and the supporting cast was very good as well. I wish the film would've spent a little more time on the supporting characters, but then the film wouldn't be titled just Noah, and at already over two hours long, no additional time is incredibly necessary - just better time management I suppose. I would recommend going to the theatre, if you're inclined to see this movie, just for the way it looks on the big screen. Other than that, its good for a Red Box Friday night in three months.",Noah
521,j-connolly,"Noah (2014, Darren Aronovsky)",2,24 March 2020,"The film has an excellent cast. It starts promisingly, but is soon let down by a howling maelstrom of themes clshing in confusion much like the tempest and unending rain flooding the earth as they float in a sort of enormous shed on the limitless oceans.The potentially interesting angle of practical matters involved in an ark are skated over, as are all specific and potentially rich avenues of life on an ark.Instead, the focus is on family, childen, and a range of characters who don't take on proper form because the script doesn't let them. There are only three central character, and none of these are developed meaningfully. Including Noah, who is a symbol without persona.It's a film which passed very slowly. And yet the film was not without some critical success, which makes me wonder.Minor point : Crowe is directed with the current malady of actors mumbling and muttering their lines at the very limits of what is audible. Oe gets the impression this is a technique to make us strain to hear, and pay attention, giving the illusion this is something really worth listening to. The bits we can't quite make out, we subconsciously think must be profoundly deep and meaningful since, being inaudible, they are cloaked in mystery.",Noah
522,stephen_mac,Well....that was different?,3,30 March 2014,"So, think you know the several thousand year old story of Noah do you?! Think again. Apparently there were more than a few details missing in the original tale and even things that the big guy upstairs must have got wrong. The first 30 seconds or so were doing pretty good and then along came the big rock guys, kind of like Lego Bionicles on steroids, who were there to help and nurture Cain and mankind. Noah seems to be trying to get a modern day message across as well, references to how badly Cain's decedents have looked after their world paralleling perhaps to todays ecological issues, but all this really achieved was over complicating the storyline and creating story arcs that seemed to go nowhere and never really made a point. Even the type of filmography changed at these times with soft music perhaps intended to usher in for the cinema goer a change of attitude. Epic fail. Perhaps there was an assumption that in today's non-religious world the Biblical version is little known, and maybe there is a point to that which allowed Aronofsky, the director, to take a direction that was at best 'off centre' but I beg to differ. For many, the continual changes and misdirections, that Noah's family suddenly diminished in numbers, that suddenly Noah and his family were not as righteous as God had indicated, that Noah was now to sacrifice his grandchildren, and more......all became a bit much and as hard as I tried to take this movie seriously, it became harder and harder as it went on.

523,artyyeo,Not worth it: even if you consider it only as a fantasy movie,2,29 March 2014,"Acting: The acting was quite bad. Lots of unnecessary pauses. Besides Russell Crowe, the rest of the actors and actresses felt out of place. Even Russell's acting was not his best.Screenplay: The dialogs were poorly put together. I am not inspired by any single line.Biblical accuracies: There are gross inaccuracies in the movie. They are not minor inaccuracies but they are so large that it will make you cringe on your seat: a) the number of humans in the ark is wrong b) who was in the ark is also wrong c) new humans were born in the ark is wrong d) Noah killed people in this movie is wrong. e) The Watchers, who were never mentioned in the Bible, played a critical role in building the ark. For a while, I thought I was watching a Transformer movie. f) Noah ran around like a mad-man trying to kill 2 infants in the ark is utter rubbish. g) Methusaleh was depicted as a sorcerer. h) 2 out of 3 of Noah's sons were depicted as rebels. i) One of Noah's sons, Shem, was depicted as a person who goes into woods to pet with his girlfriend: a sexual theme that is currently accepted as the norm in our society.Irreverence for God: a) No sacrificial offering on the altar was made by Noah to worship God when they left the ark. b) God did not renew His covenant with Noah and his sons when they left the ark. c) A very indistinct and half-hearted rainbow was presented at the end before the movie wrapped up. It was so indistinct, it could easily be mistaken for a lens flare against the sun. In fact, it was presented as a lens flare against the sun and then it morphed into a faint rainbow. With the CGI that was used throughout the movie, I thought a clear colorful rainbow could have be added into a scene but I guess the director/producer may have thought that a Biblical rainbow may offend a certain community that uses the rainbow for their cause.Post-modernism in full swing: a) Towards the end, Noah's daughter-in-law preached to him that his decision to love instead of obeying God sets the new direction for this new world. In other words, it was men's rule and will that started off with the post-flood world. Men-centricity was to be worshipped all over again. b) Noah's wife rebelled against him when they were in the ark. It was never recorded in the Bible that she was such a person. But, 21st century feminism was pushed to the foreground and used to wake up the one-track minded Noah to think about his family besides his God.Conclusion: Focus on the Family's PluggedIn.com website gave us one redeeming reason for watching the movie: they said that it may provide a talking point between Christians and unbelievers. I think we should save the money and the time. Every single one of my family felt violated spiritually and emotionally disturbed throughout the movie. It is not worth the time, the money and the torture. There was zero spiritual inspiration but overwhelming disgust dominated all of us when we left the theater.",Noah
524,micahmatt-fcb,Great movie depending on who you ask.,8,13 April 2014,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I partly expected a religious flaunting, but it was anything but that. Noah is a re-imagining of the classic myth. It has elements of Lord of the Rings. The idea of ""God"" is referred to as ""The Creator"". It's not a religious movie, but more of a movie telling a different version of mythology. It's an entertaining re-imagining of something we have heard over and over. You know you're at a good movie when angry religious people storm out of the room in the middle of the movie and throw popcorn at the screen when the credits roll. Worth seeing, but I would probably wait til it's on DVD/Blu Ray. Not a bad movie at all, but since movies these days are so expensive, I would just wait if I were you.",Noah
525,mvinnaco,As Good As A Movie About Noah Could Be,6,11 April 2014,"While certainly not Aronofsky's best work, Noah is a solid entry into the director's outstanding catalog. The plot doesn't stray as far from the Bible as some say it does, and I appreciate that Aronofsky was not afraid to explore the moral implications inherent in Letting Everyone In The World Die. It reminded me of Princess Mononoke, as it uses religious imagery to tell an environmentalist story. The cinematography is as gorgeous as you'd expect from Aronofsky. Russell Crowe remembered to act this time, so his performance was better than I expected from him. Emma Watson was great, Jennifer Connelly was solid and I loved Anthony Hopkins' Methusaleh. I think Clint Mansell phoned the score in a little because it sounded an awful lot like his score for The Fountain. My biggest issues with this were the pacing and the script. It's sluggish in spots and the dialog could have been better. It follows the Bible story closer than the haters would have you think. Yes, the Watchers are in the Bible. No, this isn't the same as the Nephilim. The Watchers feature prominently in the apocryphal book of Enoch (Which is why you can't find it if you're thumbing through a KJV) and they make a brief appearance in Daniel. The Bible has some really weird things in it. Yes, the movie DOES say the word ""god"". Overall, it's worth seeing on the big screen because the visuals are great.",Noah

You the non-religious person who does not believe that the Bible was actually real (because unfortunately it wasn't, unless you live in fantasy land). That is exactly what this movie is, a complete work of fiction from the reality point of view. This event could have never taken place as you will clearly see in the film. Because it is just impossible for such an event to actually take place. The story is amazing! The characters are very honest and full of emotion! You will cry during some scenes,you will understand how hard the choices Noah made were. The cinematography was just beautiful! It does remind me a lot of Lord of the Rings because of the beautiful landscape scenery and action scenes. I loved this movie very much, for the story, the action, the fantasy of it all is just very pure and sincere. Darren Aronofsky did a phenomenal job with this film! I am a huge fan of Requiem for Dream and Black Swan. You will see his directing style in NOAH and LOVE IT! Don't go watch this movie to have your beliefs in the Bible reaffirmed or to compare.

528,pavelb-968-44685,Some good elements but mediocre package overall,6,25 June 2015,"I found the first half of the picture to be quite good - some of the cinematography was excellent. A few scenes, in subdued light, were memorable and the acting decent. Both Noah and The King were very good, but Noah's wife was miscast. A much physically stronger looking wife (with inferior dental work) would have been more convincing. The worst member of the cast was the ""barren"" girl who gets repaired by Methuselah. I suppose the ancient man's fixation on berries was a hint at his power? A number of the scenes weren't sufficiently elaborated on and were lost CG entertainment opportunities - the animal loading scenes needed more and the scenes with Man defiling everything in sight, just before the flood, probably suffered from too much editing. The ""Watchers"" or were they transformers, were completely unnecessary, although they added credence to the survival of Noah's family. A much more interesting sequence allowing our heroes to escape attack needed to be penned. As with so many scripts and stories, the writers didn't know how to end this epic. And I sympathize... how do you hint at the renewed beginnings of mankind from six closely related people?

There were so many 'literary licenses' taken with Holy Scriptures it defied belief. Now I'm not naive enough to have expected a scripturally correct version of events and I'm a happy watcher of some of the older stories such as ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and even ""The Passion of Christ"", which took plenty of liberties but at least stayed within the context and atmosphere of the story. This movie did none of those things.Some of the additions to the story were: It made mention of ""watchers"", supernatural beings (angels) who watched over Noah and his family. No such beings are mentioned in Genesis.These supernatural beings apparently sinned and were clad in stone as a punishment They then came to life and helped Noah and his family to build the ark! (Terminator meets the Great Flood!) There was much made of the sons being discontent because they wouldn't be able to have wives and children and therefore be 'men' and Noah told them the reason for this was that mankind was to be exterminated too. But in Genesis (6:18)it says ""you will enter the ark; you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you"" The ark was also afloat long enough for Shem's wife to conceive and give birth to twin daughters. In Genesis (8:14) it says that ""By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry"". the first born of Shem were Cain and Abel not as depicted in the movie (I won't spoil it any more for you by explaining that!)Very disappointing all round.",Noah
530,Viking131313,"Excellent acting, music and special effects, but a truly abysmal script.",1,5 August 2014,"Crowe and Watson delivered incredible performances from a script that would receive an F in any serious writing course. Connelly did as good as I've ever seen from her. Hopkins did more than anyone could have with such a pathetically written part, honestly I think it must have taken it as a favor to someone. The visual effects and the musical score are everything you would want and expect from a big budget movie.The failing here clearly lies with the writer/director. He wrapped himself in the Christian hating, bigoted cloak that is Hollywood. Taking a classic biblical tale that is even well known by people like me who haven't been to church in over four decades and attempting to turn it on its head by portraying the protagonist as some kind of infanticidal lunatic. Clearly this is just another attempt by haters to taint the world against Christians. I might have given this movie a 3 or 4 star rating, if not for the 9 and 10 star ratings that have obviously been bought and paid for by the studio. I say this because there is no way that any sane, intelligent, movie goer could ever, and I do mean ever, consider this movie to be worthy of 9 or 10 stars.",Noah

Stone monsters? Noah killing people? People trying to attack the arc?

532,cazaman,As an attempted bible re-telling or it's own work - Just awful,2,22 September 2014,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. For only a brief moment did I even care about the characters (the casting wasn't actually that bad), but the story was lost from the outset. If you are going to deviate so drastically from a traditional tale, then at least do a good job of creating something new and interesting. I watched this show with the full knowledge that the writers had used some artistic license, but I was not expecting such a horrible mess of a film. The special effects looked like something from the 1980's and whoever made the decision to portray the fallen angels as beings made from stone should be banned from Hollywood for life. And what was the point of the role of Methuselah in this portrayal? Just a strange, random and pointless character, contributing nothing but confusion.As a 'science fiction' film, this movie is poorly done but the real tragedy of this attempt is that it lost almost everything about the original story. As a stand alone fairy tale, this film is utterly underwhelming, but as a representation of a tale from the bible it will just confuse people as to the original telling. This movie was a lost opportunity to explore the scriptures, the impossibilities and the doubts of the story of the ark. Instead it will just be lost in the annals of Hollywood detritus.",Noah
533,vovazg,Follow the Word given but be sure to have the wisdom to understand it first..,10,20 April 2020,"This is the point of the movie. God is talking to Noah and telling him exactly what to do in his vision. But is it exactly everything? And this is the beauty of this story told perfectly in the movie Noah from Darren Arronofsky. There are so many levels and I'm not talking about the CGI effects or the Watchers, although the actors did great work (especially Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Anthony Hopkins and others) and Darren as always delivered us yet another amazing experience and atmosphere. The Universal law says that there is the source and the consequence always connected from the times of beginnings and will always be. There is the wisdom of the mind and the love and energy of the heart. And the connecting will power of the two will set anything into motion. All our actions started as a thought and they end up in deeds, any deed, from small ones, to the big ones even like saving or destroying the whole world. So all of this is given to human. Such powerful toll all of us have unlike any other creature on this planet. So it's up to us to decide what to do and deal with the consequences. Because of how human acted then, the great flood came. But God warned Noah was and gave him the most important task. Reset is coming, save the innocent. Is there any place for humans there? Noah did perfectly with his task until he was put to a real test. Does following exactly what God intended for him includes even going against the ones he cares the most? Of many of qualities Noah had in this movie, wisdom and clear vision were one of the most important on the list. But it wasn't easy to find them always. Same goes for everyone. What does God want from us? With the Humans the wisdom will always be the key. And God left it to us to use it. Today is Corona virus stopping everything, tomorrow maybe some other kind of ""flood"" and we need to have good connection to our roots and nature (of our selves) and see things clearly so our actions can come from wisdom. It's not easy. And we don't even have the task Noah got. Still we all have the responsibility. This is why I really love this move. It's so spiritual and important. Go back to your roots, to your nature of what it really means to be human to protect and have connection to everything around you. If God created us on his image means we have to be connected, not disconnected, we have to have His/Human qualities and be the protector of everything that exists on this planet, everything innocent and pass the knowledge further. Otherwise a new flood in whatever form can come..",Noah

I thought they'd made a Hollywood move and taken a story that has been done to death. I was going to skip it but I'd read an article explaining how annoyed it made Christians and that it was based on Gnostic teachings. I just watched it and I thought it was awesome! the story, scenery, atmosphere and possibly music (I don't remember any of it but I don't remember disliking it).I don't really know the Biblical story that well. I've heard it many times but apart from certain points, I'm unsure what happens while they're out at sea or what happens once arrive. I liked how Noah came across as a crazed nutter towards the end. This is a realistic portrayal of anyone who is carrying out any grandiose/divine plan.Some of the other actors/actresses seemed out of place, mainly Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly. I find their reactions to situations... I don't know, generic or predictable? hollow is another word that comes to mind. However, I find them attractive, so they're nice to look at.The fallen angels reminded me of Return to Oz for some reason. Specifically in their rock-monster forms.If you are a Christian that sticks to the Bible, you'll probably find most of this offensive or just plain wrong. Regardless, you might have your faith strengthened by this movie, as Noah is very human and stuffs up many times... he even delves into alcoholism for a bit.",Noah
536,pyrpaul1616,A surprisingly good film buried for many beneath the bad taste of religion.,7,9 December 2019,"Had the mythology, the lore and laws of magic and mystic lands, of this movie been based on the Æsir and Vanir of Norse origins, or even of the Maiar and Valar from the imaginations of JRR Tolkien, or even some new confangled system of fantasy, it would of been more palpable to common audiences than that of classic Christianity. What is over looked is that the story of Noah is off all Abrahamic religions, and not just the christian belief systems, but that is for a different essay.Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly lead a cast that is a mix of the reputable and young. Ray Winstone asks to par to his familiar role as the though baddy. Emma Watson, as always, lives up to her billing as a senior actress, talented beyond her years. But we should not get carried away. The script, while not poor, is stifling and each an every performance is to spec, and not wanton, but for these talented actors its just a days work well done.As with all movies of Good Vs Evil it is the subtext that matters here. It is not a discussion of Believers against Unbelievers, as is the overt convention. But Greed Vs Growth, Kindness Vs Consumption, Selflessness Vs Selfishness. There are also heavy overtones about the sins of the consumption of meat that many, many people may take offence to. Director Darren Aronofsky has once made reference to himself on Twitter as 'the NOTORIOUS V.E.G.' Make of that what you will. But in the eyes of this reviewing omnivore it is very much the time for us as a society to look to our systematic raising of, and consumption of, meat.All in all this movie is more than passable. Deserving of a score higher than its current 5.8. An entertaining 2hrs this movie comes near to attaining the feel of epic that it so seeks, but maybe falls a bit short in the end. The systems of mysticisms, maybe even an expectation of Deus Ex Machina, have in my opinion biased the viewing crowd, if not before they view the film then certainly after they sit through the terrible opening titles and clunky explanations (by far the only two poor minutes of the movie). We are now a public, so willing to believe in Wizards and Demi-Gods and Superheroes, that it find strange how we cringe so at the words of Angles and Miracles. I suppose those words mean different things to us now, come from a different place and a different time than ourselves. A time we have long been trying to distance ourselves from. A time that maybe we should look more to.",Noah

Even people with little or no religious education have heard of Noah and his building of the Arc, the animals going in two by two and the great flood that destroyed mankind. With material like this to work from Noah should have been an epic along the lines of The Ten Commandments or Ben Hur, what we got was The Poseidon Adventure meets Transformers. Personally I think the filmmakers should have stuck to the Biblical account and, because the story and its characters is already so rich, they could have crammed it full of special effects and made it a movie to remember, instead of one so easy to forget.",Noah

539,xxXStarWarriorXxx,Nooooo Aaaaahh!!,1,17 July 2014,"I was so excited when I first saw the promos for this movie last year. A big budget movie with a decent star cast, special effects and all that. I was hoping it would be a biblical blockbuster like Ben-Hur or Ten Commandments. I waited and waited and finally here it was.....I couldn't believe what I was watching, it was shocking to see the liberties they took with this one. Snake skin that glows when it wrapped around your arm. You think it might give you super powers but no it doesn't. Fire balls that can be used for making instant fire and you guessed it, used as explosives. Dogs with scales like armadillo, hunted down and eaten by the others. I understand they need to be creative to make it exciting for the viewers but the stuff they came up with is just ridiculous.The book of Genesis does mention Nephalim or Nephalites, the giants who lived at the time. But it doesn't say anything about Transformer like monsters made of rocks called Watchers. According to this movie the Watchers built the ark, not Noah and his family.The Noah we know was 600 years old when the ark was completed, he had grand children and great grand children. This movie got it completely wrong, looks like they didn't even bother reading Genesis before writing the script. This Noah has more trouble with his teenagers than anything else.Most importantly this Noah has no contact with God, he doesn't pray or hear voices. He just has a nightmare and decides to build an ark. Overall it is a dark, twisted imagination which is sad and disturbing. It almost portrays that second chance given humanity was a curse. The characters are so miserable including Noah you wish the ark sank. The animals would've been more entertaining than the actors but they were put to sleep. I'm surprised how it's got a rating of over 6, I gave it 2 stars only for special effects.So please don't bother if you have not watched it yet. Don't waste your time or money at the cinema or on buying dvds. I would recommend the Noah segment in 'The Bible' [1966] which is actually based on the book of Genesis.",Noah
540,bunji999,Finding N.I.N.O (Noah in Name Only),1,17 August 2014,"The only thing I'm grateful for after watching this convoluted mess was that I watched it in the comfort of my home and could shout at the screen and laugh hysterically at the absurdity of the so-called plot.First and foremost, if you take the film strictly on its own merits, without comparing it to any of the biblical interpretations of the film's namesake, it's still a confusing mishmash of plot lines and trumped up drama that leave the viewer feeling as if they'd just drunk some of Methuselah's ""tea.""We begin with the time-honored telling of the ejection from paradise followed by angels turned transformer er, rock monsters whose only transgression was wanting to help the poor, defenseless humans who'd just been kicked out of their parents' basement. Then I guess the fallen angels/rock monsters aided humans in building a civilization. The humans then repaid Optimus and company by turning against them and God. What was their sin, you may ask? Well, instead of driving Priuses, voting Democrat, and donating to Green Peace, they opted to attend Tea Party rallies, drive SUV's, and strip mine the planet for magic stones. (The stones have the same effect as roman candles you'd pick up on a roadside fireworks stand anywhere in West Virginia.)God, being the card-carrying member of PETA, Earth First!, and Sierra Club that He was, decided He'd had enough and that mankind was due for a global swirly. He really didn't have to do much, though. You see, mankind created a CO2 imbalance in the atmosphere by burning all the stones they'd dug up (fossil fuels). This imbalance trapped heat in the atmosphere (global warming), melted the polar icecaps, thereby dumping billions of gallons of water into the oceans, upsetting their delicate balance, ultimately resulting in super storms which oh wait, that's Day After TomorrowSo, deciding that the poor, defenseless land-dwelling beasts needed a place to ride out the ""Big Flush,"" God enlisted the help of someone. Enter Noah, a nature-loving vegan perpetually put off because he didn't get a glowing snakeskin blessing from his father (Robert the Bruce) because said patriarch was cut down by the evil strip-mining, meat- eating king, Tubal-Cain. What followed was an uninspired, grouchy Noah who dragged his family through Mad Max-inspired landscapes to see dear old grandpa Odin I mean Methuselah. After being roofied by the crazy old man, Noah gets treated to an IMAX preview of the flood and gets even more depressed (if that's possible).After finding his tooth, giving back Mike Tyson's lion, and fleeing from Ken Jeong, Noah gets on with his task. Upon planting a magic bean given to him by Odin, Noah gets an instant forest complete with river system. (All that was missing from the scene was ""In The Jungle"" playing in the background.) In a feeble attempt to reduce the length of this TL:DR review, I'll just say, they built the boat, the waters came, and Noah went completely insane. The End.If you can look past 40-day pregnancies, magical potions that put animals to sleep for WEEKS while not affecting humans at all,an Ark that winds up with just as many holes as the film's plot has, and a magical snakeskin which seems to serve no purpose but to make people's skin glow, then I guess this film is for you. This is a terrible groan- fest and I'm STUNNED Crow, Connely, Winstone, Hopkins, and Watson signed up for it.As far as biblical comparison, apparently mankind's ""sin"" was over- mining the Earth and eating the animals. This leads me to believe Aronofsky borrowed more from Dr. Seuss' The Lorax than Genesis. Also, I guess there were no descendants of Ham in the version of the Bible he used, Fallen Angels (AKA Demons) helped build the ark, and Noah's son plots with a stowaway madman to kill him. Oh, and let's not forget the fusion of evolution and creation. I have to agree with another reviewer on here, it's too ludicrous to be blasphemous. There's a fine line between artistic license and completely departing from the source material, and Aronofsky pole-vaulted over it. Hollywood spends so much time denigrating and distancing themselves from all things biblical that they come off looking like complete idiots when they approach the subject matter. If it wasn't so completely absurd, it would be offensive. Ultimately, it just proves Hollywood's willful ignorance regarding Christian theology.However, if you're a modern-day environmentalist, vegan progressive this film makes PERFECT sense. To progressives, eating meat and mining ARE unforgivable sins. In fact, mankind itself is a plague on the planet and Aronofsky makes you feel disappointed that mankind survived the flood in the first place. He also employs tired, politically progressive premises in his film. For instance, being masculine is akin to being hostile, ignorant, violent, and short-sighted. The film was devoid of strong central authority figures. The antagonist and protagonist seemed more like WWE wrestlers shouting at one another across an arena. In fact, everyone in a patriarchal role from God and Noah to the king failed to demonstrate meaningful leadership. It was those who rebelled that made moral choices – Noah's wife, the fallen angels, and even Noah's own son, Ham. This was clearly written to favor the matriarchal vs. patriarchal point of view. It harks back to the playground argument - who is better: boys or girls? It also forwards the now popular notion that God is a brutal, disinterested, loveless creator only interested in control and dominance. This film is an extreme exercise in pandering to one's own ideology – what progressives love to accuse Christians of doing.Don't waste your time. This film doesn't see any goodness in mankind and you'd be left depressed and guilty the next time you fire off a roman candle while eating a hamburger. (I won't, but you may.)",Noah
541,john-kim-howard,Don't miss because of the evangelicals,8,30 March 2014,"First of all, anyone who gives this movie a 1 has got some real issues. I almost changed movies when I saw the plethora of bad user reviews, but slowly began to read between the lines. The negative reviews have nothing to do with the movie, as in, bad acting, bad directing, bad special effects, no plot line. They all have to do with the story of Noah being told in a mythological sense rather than some bible thumping, and then God said Old Testament kind of way. Granted, the story comes from the Old Testament, but if you're not totally hung up on an absolute literal biblical presentation then the movie is absolutely fabulous. Russell Crowe is fantastic as Noah and gives a phenomenal performance. In fact, the acting by all the characters was a thing of beauty. Not enjoying the movie as a great job of story telling, which is what the director's job is, is losing the whole great story of Noah. I always loved the story of Noah, not because of the, ""people have been sinning again, time for God to wipe everybody out theme"". The metaphor I loved was that God entrusts a good man, Noah, with the stewardship of protecting life on this planet. God doesn't leave it up to Noah which animals to save, God's already made the world perfect in that regard, Noah is tasked to save a pair of everything. Period. And he does it, albeit with a huge load of, yes, science fiction like magic, straight from, guess who? The movie does have some slow periods, but it generally moves along very well. For the most part I thought it was very moving. Quite honestly I had a moment or two of the inspirational tears well up. The special effects are fantastic. My wife and teenage son all thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you like fantastic stories with action, passion, struggle and enormous challenge, almost science fiction like or very Mythological in many ways, then I'm pretty sure you'll like this movie. It's Epic, an epic story and an epic movie. However, with all due respect, if you're seriously hung up on Christian dogma, you'd be better to stay home and read your bible.",Noah

Not to mention the inaccuracy to the known historical stories but everything in the movie was below par. You cant take this movie in any other way other than a portrayal of historical fact/story but even if you try for the sake of argument the movie falls short because of countless plot holes, bad and in some cases horrible acting, poor CGI etc. Only bright thing about this movie to me was the music and the acting of Russell Crowe.

543,cthulu48,Beware of polarized reviews....,9,26 July 2020,"Lots of people are hating this movie for several reasons.... The majority of the negative reviews claim that the big problem is that the film strays too far away from the original text found in the Bible regarding Noah's Arc. Well, the reason for this is simple...The story of Noah's Arc in the Bible is a very short story.... I believe the story is roundabout 3-4 pages long, and that's it. Aronofsky had to make a full length movie with a running time clocking in at about two and a half hours. So, naturally, the majority of ""Noah"" has a lot of creative liscence over the elements necessary to create an entire film. This fact shows what an amazing imagination that Darren Aronofsky has.Also, from the negative reviews that I have read, for the most part, are written by angry Christians who are just flabbergasted with the artistic embellishments in the film that are definitely not written in the Bible.Long story short, if you truly love Darren Aronofsky's films, you will probably like the film. If you only want the straight story of Noah's Arc, stick with just reading the Bible.An average rating of ""5.7"" stars by the public is INCREDIBLY LOW for how good the film is.

544,danielphillips97-251-836566,"Bold, Ambitious and Controversial. The Requiem for a Dream of Blockbusters",8,6 April 2014,"After the commercial and critical successes of 'Black Swan' and 'The Wrestler', Darren Aronofsky has gone for something more ambitious. Darren Aronofsky has managed to make a film on an epic scope whilst also remaining true to himself. It's both epic and fantastical whilst also being intense and emotional, intimate and thought-provoking.This film is receiving a lot of harsh criticism, mainly from religious fundamentalists which I feel is unfair. Noah isn't originally a bible story anyway. The bible was just one of the several sources this film was inspired by. I was watching this film with a friend, and we both loved it. I predict the rating will go up and this film will become a cult classic once the initial shock dies down. For any atheists thinking of missing this film, I suggest you see it. The film hardly bares any resemblance to the bible.If people have certain expectations about a movie, then they want it to fit into those expectations. The thing that's alienating about 'Noah' is that it tries to be everything, an action, adventure, epic, disaster, war, thriller, horror, romance, drama and fantasy.There are a lot of ideas thrown into this film, some of which work better than others, but it held my attention from beginning till end. Even its flaws are interesting.Some of the CGI looks a bit comical and unconvincing such as the rock creatures and the snake. There's a silly scene where Noah's grandfather is on the ground searching for grapes right in the middle of a massive flood and battle. It's arguably forced towards the end.Before they build the ark, not a lot happens. It's basically just setting the scene and the characters. There are flashbacks and visions of people drowning in the flood which are horrifying and convincing.There's an amazing dream sequence where the forest is on fire, and some other visually amazing scenes throughout the film which I won't spoil for you.After they build the ark, the villain, Tubal Caine plans to invade the ark with an army. First he gives a monologue, followed by an epic battle and flood sequence which is really tense and exciting. There's a huge army trying to invade the ark as the flood is happening and Noah with the help of the rock creatures tries to fend them off. As the flood waters are rising, water shoots up from the ground and destroys the land. There's a terrifying image of people clinging onto rocks for their lives as the waters are rising.You'd think the flood would be the climax of the movie, but it's when it really gets going. Once they get on the ark, Noah tells his children a story involving a stunning animated sequence of the creation of the universe and the evolution of man.From here on, the film becomes really dark and intense, almost like a horror. I won't tell you what happens, but I was on the edge of my seat. With a thunderous score and an unsettling performance by Russell Crowe, it has the intensity of 'Black Swan' and 'Requiem for a Dream' mixed with the raw emotion of 'The Wrestler' and 'The Fountain'.The score's fantastic, at times tense and exciting, and at times emotional or inspirational.Darren Aronofsky has created a bold, controversial and ambitious film that pushes the formula for a big studio blockbuster and left me with loads to think about once it was over. You could say this is the 'Requiem for a Dream' of blockbusters.",Noah
545,lopezmaggivonkarma,"""Noah"" My modest film review",6,1 April 2014,"""Noah"" is an emotionally incomplete film. There is a great casting, but with the end result one can see that this is a ploy to attract any public, as well smoothing with the stars the rough connotations of material. Yet there are problems with the casting: Russell Crowe is a very good actor, but has always liked this kind of theater projects, so when one goes to see a film with him, know that you will see at least one heavy film (eg, ""Les Misérables""). On the other hand, Anthony Hopkins has a rather roguish face that conveys playfulness, one sees Hopkins as a rogue and friendly old man with a beard, when his character Methuselah had been better with a man who inspires a paternal image, eg Michael Gambon or Ian McKellen. And finally Emma Watson, whose performance is really mediocre, generally she is not bad actress, but here is facing a dramatic range that can not cope(Warning: from now the review contains heavy spoilers, although some are not technically spoilers if you know the epic of Noah) But these casting problems are outweighed by worse problems. Darren Aronofsky is a great director who made great movies, but can not deal with his script and appeals to easy and sloppy tricks. The film is not didactic: If you did not read the Bible, you can barely understand ""Noah"". The film begins with a world destroyed and you do not know why (actually is nothing special: it is the artistic vision of the world in decline by Aronofsky, before the flood). The ""Noah"" directorial logistics is almost episodic and lacks narrative bridges in the first hour, everything is a succession of events in the movie where there is no coherent link to move from one event to another. Thus, we see special effects forming forests or water jets or large herds of animals without knowing how or when, we see scenes that should have been seen sooner rather than later (eg scenes of Tubal- cain massacres , or whole story of the creation of the universe ). Also the edition of the protagonists is mixed, with many characters coming and going to places that only know when they left. Because of the shallowness, the role of the villain is not well defined and their threat is more apparent than realBut speaking of villains, is where ""Noah"" shows its limitations. The film takes enough licenses and expanding moments in the life of Noah that do not appear in the Bible, in order to form a psychological picture of the protagonist. Not very different from ""Troy"" movie where the Iliad got a Freudian value. There are stone beings as a script resource to provide some battles in a story that lacks action. The stone beings are a resource to replace what would humans battling in ""The Lord of the Rings"", it happens that Noah is not a warrior who possesses an army to defend him, so give real soldiers to defend Noah would have been an embarrassment and thats why the script chose fantastic beings.The problem with the psychological approach is that instead of hiding the Christian connotations , put them out even more clearly. One should not criticize holy bible, but it is true that the world has changed and our thinking is more modern therefore many ideas of the film are overwhelmingly sad. View as a superior being dedicated to massacre an entire world is unacceptable, especially since the villains are not defined (perhaps due to time), and when the film gives them an exposure time, the dialogues are unfortunately too feasible. One can not hate the villains simply because their only sin is to try to survive. There are some scenes (arriving late in the film) shows where Tubal-Cain and his followers committed gross acts, but they are so short and little explanatory that are not helpful to demonize TubalIn contrast , the character of Noah is just a shame. One expected, according to the psychological approach, that Noah will be a guy fighting hard on his divalency between obeying God or not, but in reality things are far from this theory. However, Noah is an individual willing to defend the principles of his creator and only in the end he gets a glimpse of mercy, and this is not so much hint of generosity but of cowardice. The rigidity and lack of modernization of the Bible generated the most embarrassing moments of ""Noah"": Na'el death, which is a cruel detailThis review continues on my personal Tumblr, which has no commercial purpose nowhttp://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/81406036755/noah-film-review",Noah

I felt the movie moved along at a decent pace until the last third when it just became so unbearably weird and unreal that I didn't care about it anymore.

I don't believe that the Bible is simply a book of 'fables' or 'morality tales' -which false and idiotic notions are becoming more and more popular among all people these days.
In today's day and age, many or most people would consider me 'gullible,' 'foolish,' or 'illogical' as a staunch believer in scriptures. However, I believe that it's 'the other way around': Society and people have never been more blasphemous or stupid than they are in today's day and age -- and it absolutely is NOT 'concidental' that the waning intelligence in society has 'coincided' with 'secularism' and people becoming 'atheist' and returning to pagan roots and losing their faith and knowledge in things that are 'spiritual' and in God: This is one of many proofs that 'the glory of God truly IS intelligence'.....and that conversely, society and people do become stupid in EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY when they become 'God-less.'Nearly everything; nearly every aspect of society for the past at least 50-60 years, has become exponentially stupider and stupider with every succeeding decade.....and there's no reason to believe this trend will not continue.....
Movies have never been more talentless and stupider; neither have today's 'sports heroes'/'athletes' today's music........today's politicians, most everything...
Critics have longed lost the ability to 'critique': A very high percentage of movies that are truly dreadful and awful 1 or 0-star movies -- which not surprisingly have appeared mostly only starting in the 2000s to the present date, are considered to be 'great' 4-star movies by many or most critics. One of many examples of this is that I have very unbiasedly given ""0 star"" ratings to two of the newest Star Trek movies (Chris Pine and company). Yes, I believe that they are THAT stupid and talentless....and THAT bad.
I believe that the Biblical Noah was a very righteous and holy man....and that he was commanded to build an ark by the Lord. I believe that the Lord did guide ""2 of every species"" of all animal life into the ark; and that this thing DID actually happen and WAS possible. I believe that for all intents and purposes, that the sheer number of animal species 5,000 years ago may not need have been in the many thousands or millions...but perhaps only several thousands, or even hundreds. I believe that it IS 'logical' to believe that the 'process' of 'speciation' of all 'carbon-based life forms' has occured MUCH MORE RAPIDLY than what most scientists would ever deduce: Once the hundreds or several thousand species of animals departed Noah's ark AFTER the flood...it would have taken only a short amount of time, only several thousand years (to the present date) for thousands or millions of 'new species' of animals to have formed -by means of adaptation and mutations- from originally only hundreds or a few thousand species. Hence, the ""Biblical"" size of Noah's ark (500 feet long?) could have easily accomodated all the species of animals present at THAT TIME on earth.I also believe that Noah's flood DID cover the ENTIRE earth.....and that the highest mountains on earth at THAT time may have only been several thousands of feet high. It wasn't until AFTER the flood, in my opinion, that ""Pangae"" separated into the continents that exist today.....and that mountains became ALL OF A SUDDEN IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME exceedingly high -due to an EXTRAODINARILY-RAPID movement of all plate tectonics throughout the planet, which were caused by the flood to accelerate.....before they 'slowed down' to the very slow rate that they move today...Noah's flood, also, was likely abetted by aquifers in the earth; in other words perhaps rain, alone, for 40 days could not have covered the earth...One of the first movies that I saw Russell Crowe star in was in ""Master and Commander: Far Side of the Earth."" Because of my impressions of him in that movie -- as well as in 'Gladiator' -- I felt that at that time that he was a legitimate actor, if even a very good actor. However, since about that time (early 2000s), about every movie that I have seen him ever since, his acting skills have diminished exceedingly..and I can't recall a movie that I have seen him in since the early 2000s, in which his performance was NOT atrocious. He almost always speeks with a moronic 'gruff,' hoarse voice that is very difficult for me to understand -- hence, I'm sure is impossible for someone that is in the process of 'learning English' to understand -- he conveys very little emotion and his overall acting abilities are pathetic. He does truly belong in today's modern age of actors ; a very very stupid modern age that produces such 'actors' as Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, Brad Pitt, Chris Pine and a slew of other 'incredibly-bad' actors that don't have 1/3 the acting abilities of past greats such as Cary Grant, James Stewart, Spencer Tracy, or even Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise.Though Crowe purports to be ""Christian,"" his selection of playing roles in a movie such as THIS (Noah) and many other recent movies seems to suggest that he is a very 'laxed,' 'lapsed,' or 'dumbass' Christian.The movie, 'Noah,' starts out with Noah and his family in a barren wasteland. The descendants of Cain have filled the earth and their seeming only purpose is to hunt and kill people. 'In this movie there are ridiculously-unrealistic 'rock monsters' which were formed by the 'creator.' As far as I could recall, the word 'God' is never mentioned in the movie, ""Noah""; apparently it is much 'safer' to create a 'religious' movie these days be making it as 'irreligious' and politically-correct as possible; maybe a movie such as ""Noah"" would have created a lot of controversy or not have been nearly as popular with audiences had the word 'God' been used in the dialog of the movie, rather than 'creator.'The vestiture and attire of Noah, his sons, and the descendants of Cain does not in any way reminisce of what people 5,000 years ago would have dressed like. Most of the clothing is an ugly un-imaginitive black and reminisces of 'barbarism' or 'heathenism' from perhaps a few hundred years ago. The short hair of Noah and his sons reminisces of the 'worldliness' of today's haircut styles.
In the movie, 'Noah,' the story of Noah, his family, and the flood are completely and moronically re-interpreted in a very, very stupid, 'paganistic' and blasphemous way throughout the entire movie. Anthony Hopkins portrays ""Methuselah"" -who I am sure in 'reality' was a very holy and wise man. However, in the movie, ""Noah,"" Methuselah is a washed up 'fool' who seems to have no wisdom or knowledge of 'spirituality' or of 'God'....and who is only concerned in his old age with sipping tea and finding berries to eat. In fact, right before the flood washes away Methuselah, he is comedically actually in the process of putting one berry into his mouth immediately before his demise.Giant 'rock monsters' engage the descendants of Cain in a horrific battle as the rain begins to fall heavily which immediately precipitates the deluge. The battle scene is extraordinarily-stupid, unrealistic, and in every way conceivable doesn't even approach to being a 'poor-man's ""Lord of the Rings: Two Towers"" final battle between the orc hoards and the elves...In 'reality' all wicked people perished except for Noah and his wife and his sons and their wives. However, in the movie, 'Noah,' Noah forbids any of his sons from marrying......and not only that but 'Tubal-Cain' portrayed by Ray Winstone ends up 'sneaking' on board.....and killing and eating some of the animals in the ark. Incredibly-incredibly-incredibly blasphemous, grotesque, evil, demented and stupid. Scenarios such as this; a film such as this; could never have entered the mind of anyone alive back in the 1950s or so when the movie titled ""The Bible"" came out -which interpretation of Noah's flood is far superior and far more realistic and accurate than THIS mess of a movie was...The last -- if not ONLY time -- that I can remember watching a movie that was as strangely-fascinating as ""Noah"" -- in part because it IS so stupid and blasphemous -- was when I recently watched, for the first time ever, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988?) starring Willem Dafoe. THAT movie is so 'strange'.....bizarre.......and unintentionally 'dumb'......that I have actually watched it several times SINCE then; it is entertaining and something of a deluded unintentional comedy.
""Noah"" does have some things going for it: It is very strange, original, and unique in certain ways and at times the FX are pretty good...but in just as many ways the 'feeling' throughout the movie isn't one of 'wonder' or imagination....but instead there is a permeating spirit and atmosphere of 'washed up'....and 'pessimism'.......and darkness. ""Noah"" is a convoluted uber-moronic pagan's interpretation of the real-life Noah and flood; in some ways entertaining but also very very stupid -- and to reiterate, blasphemous. I unbiasedly give ""Noah"" a three-star rating.",Noah
549,curtisebanks,Not biblical at all,3,7 July 2018,"The only part of the bible this movie follows is that there's a man called Noah, there's an ark and a flood.First off I don't remember reading about Korg being in Genesis.
Second, Noah didn't try to kill a baby.
Third, some evil man didn't sneak on board.
Fourth, Korg and his friends didn't build the ark.
Fifth, there's no mention of the tablet with the instructions to build the ark.
Sixth, there's no mention of evolution in the bible.
.. Noah waited 100 years for the flood
... Noah was an old man at the time of the flood
... What's with the magic tape?TL;DR:
This movie is not biblical at all",Noah
550,lorraine-benn,Too different from biblical record,5,5 April 2014,"My main problem with this film was that it takes far too many liberties with the Bible story. Of course, I expected the director to pad the story with family interaction, building of the ark, scenes of the flood and so on. But the rock characters were unexpected. Also Noah's character - he was chosen as the pure person who was to continue the human race, but there are a few places in the story where he is quite willing to murder people. The actors were fine, especially Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. Scenes of the flood were well done, and the animals were credible. The real problem was that Noah never seemed really clear about God's purpose in saving him and his family.",Noah
551,steve0557,"Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings and Transformers",1,8 July 2014,"Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings and Transformers all rolled into one. With the exception, of course, the other 3 films were great. This one is embarrassing to watch. I wondered out loud whether this was meant to be a joke or perhaps an homage to those wonderfully campy and totally absurd sci-fi B movies of the 1950s. I mean can you imagine being one of the actors and having to participate in something like this!? My negative review has nothing at all to do with this film's total disregard for the Biblical text. I knew when the rock guys or whatever they're called (yeah, yeah I know the watchers) showed up this was trash. I stuck it out and tried to watch (no pun) based on what it is. Not a Bible story. But, an attempt by the writer to bastardize one of the most recognizable lessons in the Book. What you won't see in Noah: Non-spoiler alert! Mankind paying for generations of their sins. God speaking to Noah. Noah and his family eating meat. (Could not believe this buffoon of a writer made them vegans.) Oh, and, Noah's ultimate fall. Is it a story about allot of water and a big boat? Yes it is. And that's where any similarity between this movie and the story we all know ends. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Another asinine Hollywood production. Did I say homage to B movies? How about D- movies!",Noah
552,linkmastergentry,Wouldn't waste my time,4,5 April 2021,This is an alright movie but it steers pretty far from the Bible. There are some things that steer away from what the Bible has and makes Noah look ruthless. It's not horrible but I wouldn't say worth the time.,Noah
553,allowallo_135,Very disappointing,3,29 March 2014,"Went to watch this film with high expectations, especially considering Aronofsky's previous work. There are maybe a couple of okay aspects to this movie, some of the cinematography was good, some of the acting, but all in all there isn't much good to write about with this film. I expected so more from a fantastic director who chose to direct a film about an iconic biblical story. It just felt very drawn out, painful, and downright ridiculous at times. It is not really true to the actual story either, and the character of Noah does not come across as a hero in this film. It started to give me a headache towards the end, whether the headache was caused by the poor quality of the film or the fact it was just too heavy going. But go and watch the film, and judge it for yourself",Noah
554,aa_critt,Its like a beautiful pile of crap!,3,15 April 2020,The acting and cg are great but its not at all the actual story. So much was changed and added that it was just a mess of patched together plot points glued with nonsensical drama that was so far from the story of Noah it just ends ip being silly. 2 thumbs down.,Noah
555,paulgwilliams,Awful,1,25 July 2014,"Computer graphics have taken over a large part of the cinema industry. As with (in my view) the Harry Potter films, a ludicrous plot is presented as entertainment through excessive use of computer-generated visuals. In Noah even these graphics are ludicrous. They begin with the appearance of creatures supposed to be 'fallen angels' who have been turned to stone but can still walk and talk. They seem to have grown too many arms - no doubt handy when they come to build the ark! Later on we see the whole population of the world killed by these creatures in combination with the flood we are expecting. Apart from Noah and his family, one person survives and manages to easily make a hole in the side of the ark and break in. Meanwhile all the birds, snakes and animals that have flocked into the ark have been put to sleep by some incense invented by Noah's wife. I have never watched anything so ludicrous in the whole of my cinema-going experience. Why the likes of Russell Crowe, Anthony Hopkins and Emma Watson ever agreed to take part is a complete mystery.",Noah
556,grayjay1,Worst movie ever!,1,29 March 2014,"Even though I had read a number of critical articles about Noah, I went anyway on opening day. I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt. Even giving it that benefit, it was one of the worst movies I have seen. I was not expecting a completely Biblical account of the Noah story, and knew that additions to the story would have to be added, since the Bible version is quite brief. However, who would have thought that would mean weird talking Rock creatures, which looked like they came from a Transformer movie. And the area where Noah lived was totally barren rock....until he planted the seed Methuzalah gave him, and immediately an entire forest shoots up out of the ground, to supply wood to build the ark. When the ""flood"" came, instead of it starting to rain, huge columns of water were shooting up from the ground. What's with that?I was especially looking forward to the animal scenes, since the Humane Society commended the director for not using any real animals in the filming. Well, that was more than obvious! Computer animation has come a long way over the years, but this movie apparently used one of the earliest versions of CG. It looked totally fake, and all occurred in about a minute. The acting was terrible, including Russell Crowe. And the script was even worse. After a very climactic scene, where he almost killed the twin babies in a state of rage, he explains that ""All I saw was love."" I almost left at that point!If one reads all the reader reviews, I think it will become apparent that most of the viewers agree with my comments. At the end of the movie, our audience spontaneously let out an audible groan. I have never heard such negative comments as people were walking up the aisle.Save your money!",Noah
557,ConiferDon,Letting the mythic story speak in a Faithful manner,8,7 April 2014,"I was pretty shocked to see the rock monsters - they felt comic to me. Was it straight out of that sci-fi spoof with rock monsters ""Galaxy Quest""? If the Watchers could have been less goofy/Disney/maudlin I would have loved this movie more. Still...I believe the Noah story (borrowed from the Epic of Gilgamesh a millenia earlier) to be a mythic short story designed to teach our Judeo- Christian tradition about some important themes; obedience, difficulty of faithfulness, blessing vs. curse, propagation...and I think this wonderful movie honors the Bible and intent in this way. Having just seen the utterly predictable, unoriginal and dull ""Son of God"" I am glad for the vision on the screen in Noah.Great (if weird for the orthodox) plot, wonderful writing and dialog, and incredible performances by the leads especially. Powerful movie that made me glad to count Noah as part of my own back story!",Noah
558,farhangpark-40-66371,Unintentionally Hilarious,3,9 July 2014,"Darren Aronfsky is a weird man. His first film was Pi, a good and weird beginning, then he went ahead and made a great film titled Requiem For a Dream. Then he wasted about five years to make Fountain, one of the most boring films ever created without any particular reason. Of course then it was The Wrestler, once again a great experience and then it was Black Swan, again good and weird and now Noah.Simply put, Noah is not good. It's boring. It's also making the viewer hate the titular character, which would be okay if it wasn't a prophet! And I myself am not the least bit religious but still. The problem is it tries to be about everything, why show the flashes of Noah's vision? If they are not clear to Noah, how are they supposed to mean anything to me? If they are clear, why don't I get it?The whole script is moronic. Rock giant is supposedly a word in English language now and something everyone devours when offered. God feels the need to make his own mission more dramatic by making these giants vulnerable in -get this- their hearts. Some species were apparently chopped off and destroyed in the arc and so forth.Actors... Emma Watson tries to be serious by moving her eye brows once every 5 seconds, Jennifer Connelly never looked this sick and skinny in her life and the boy who played Shem looked like he was always wearing makeup and lipstick.And Aronfsky... disappoints. I had read Noah would be about Noah's loneliness. That sounded cool. They forgot to mention it was actually about Noah being a real d**k towards his family and then choosing to be alone. There really was no reason to make this film, Darren. Sorry.I gave this title 3 out of 10, because of some creative editing and one really cool scene showing the evolution of life and man; you could probably get that on youtube for free these days. It's less than 3 minutes.On the plus side, if you want to watch something actually interesting about Noah's story, I recommend watching Ricky Gervais' Out of England 2. He speaks about 10 minutes about the subject and makes more sense than the 120 minutes and 110 million dollars these guys wasted on this film.",Noah
559,michelle139,Wow just what the heck? ???,4,19 April 2015,"Um where to begin? Creative licensing to the max he totally took a biblical story and just pooped all over it there is nothing here of the biblical story except the ark and the animals, EVERYTHING else is made up I mean why not if he's adding crap to the story add unicorns or dragons you know? The fallen were a nice touch, but why why bastardize this story? I mean this is twisted I mean really twisted. Was he stoned? Or high on drugs when he made this has he even read the story? I have never been so disappointed in a movie as I was in this one it belongs on a top ten list of the worst movies made. This director should be black balled for this",Noah
560,swissguy-176-727028,My kind of Noah - spoiler alert,9,31 March 2014,"I will begin by letting you know that I am an atheist and so was not going to go watch this movie which I thought would be religious however I saw that it was an Aronofsky and I am a huge Aronofsky fan. I, therefore, obviously went to see it. I loved it. Note that I am seriously concerned about what we are doing to our planet, animals and the environment particularly with global warming and I am, also, a vegan so this movie and this Noah had me with hooked within minutes. I was on the verge of tears throughout most of the film due to the message that man's sin was not orgies etc but rather the wanton rape of the land, air and water and the violent mistreatment of each other and of the animals, birds, reptiles, fish etc The film was dramatic, the actors and actresses, for the most part, beautiful, special effects quite good. The only flaw, and why I gave it a nine instead of a ten, was that it was a little bit too long. This may not be my favorite Aronofsky film but it spoke to me and is so timely what with the most recent UN / IPCC report which says that we are all sitting ducks if we do not do something, and now, about global warming.",Noah
561,mikewill4590,What a joke!,1,24 April 2015,What a joke. This is one of the most pitiful representations of biblical truth that i have ever seen. It's as if the writer never set eyes on the scriptures but made it up as he/she went from stories of youth. The writer attempts to make God out as the bad guy and the fallen angels out as the protectors of truth. The fantasy is so insane so to leave one totally without context. As my wife states it is so ridiculous that even if one know nothing nothing about the Bible it would seem totally ridiculous. Hollywood apparently cares nothing about the truth as represented in the original documents of Scripture. Even if one sees the Scripture as fantasy it would only be just to at least represent it as it claims and not make it up as you go. The writers and producers are obviously bias to their own beliefs and cared nothing to follow the biblical narrative. Please don't waste your time with the inventions of those who care nothing with truth but only the desire to separate you form your money.,Noah
562,lovemydesignergenes,great effects.....great actors...poor script---the Bible says it better!,3,11 April 2016,"First off, I had heard from trusted people ""Noah"" is not a Biblical epic. It uses portions of Noah's story...but the changes are vast. So I just looked at ""Noah"" as an adventure story...But it still wasn't good...I expected great special effects with the Flood, the Animals...and was not disappointed. Whoever did the opening credits prestory visual graphics...prestory summation(with the yellow lettering similar to Minnelli's Van Gogh movie) did a fine job.So...when friends gave us their BluRay copy, I watched NOAH...at least till near the end when I (bored) fast forwarded thru the last few scenes ...and then saw...Ham running away. OK. got it. 'yawn' Fine actors...decent special effects....poor script.WHY use a ""history"" tagline--and market under ""Biblical epic"" if your story is obviously FAR FAR removed from the Biblical account? Why not just market ""Noah"" as ""a story SUGGESTED... by Biblical and other ancient sources of the Flood account""? (Other cultures have somewhat similar FLOOD stories.)I think some Hollywood execs think many of us are stupid. I did like the ""Watchers"" ...the ""fallen"" angels..from the Tar Pit...whom I see as Bronze Age ""ancestors"" of 21st century ""Transformers"".They have no real relation to the Biblical story but in this film they add a tiny bit of interest...and show their ""creator"" as forgiving...at least of them.I did NOT like their ""ark"" which does not resemble the given proportions of the ARK in the Bible. Why wouldn't you follow those proportions...? At least...to draw in people who have a rough acquaintance with Noah, the Ark from the Bible, visual images??? (Hollywood execs think we all are stupid. Yeah.. The sad thing is...Noah and the Ark...from the Bible is a fine story...even if you don't believe God can supernaturally rescue people/animals in that way (like I do. And many of the past truly Biblical epics combined good actors/good effects with...a script close to the Biblical accounts. Many of those movies (incidentally) made good box office. Yes...the Dogma IS the Drama...as Dorothy L. Sayers observed. PS...soon there will be a to-scale replica of The Ark in the US. See for yourself...the amazing boat whose proportions were given in the Bible thousands of years ago...And note...while indeed the punishment for the humans' great evil was harsh, there was much grace (And Noah's sons all had wives...or no one would be here to write...or read this note). ;)",Noah
563,thevisitor967-526-781026,I liked it.,9,18 April 2014,"I liked it--especially the cinematography, directing, acting and writing. It reminded me of a Shakespearean play. The scene where Noah is tested whether he will kill his grandchildren or not may not have been out of the scriptures of Noah, but it was definitely reminiscent of the scriptures of Abraham (and Isaac). And the stone ents that a lot of people are complaining about are supposed to be the lions and ferocious animals that protected the ark, which is straight out of the bible! And for your information, after the flood, Noah started a winery and was in fact found drunk and naked by Ham. I will admit that there was some artistic liberty taken in this film, but the overall message was worth it--that humanity is basically good and worth giving a second chance. What is wrong with that? It's not like this movie was advocating evil. And in terms of the special effects and all that--how else are you going to get young people to see a movie about a story that was written thousands of years ago?!",Noah
564,cheyennesmith-762-532623,This movie belongs in Hell.,1,9 August 2014,"This movie was complete Crap. With a capital C. I still can't believe I went to go see this movie in theaters. First off ""Noah"" is nothing like the Bible. The director takes the story of Noah's Ark makes a stupid, badly written fantasy movie out of it.Noah never encountered, and have help building the Ark from rock monsters. The rock monsters is what killed the movie for me. Like the rock monster were bad enough later on we see a creature that looks like a dog with scales on it. When I saw that scaly dog I knew I was in trouble. The CGI was TERRIBLE. All the animals looked fake when they were entering the ark. The movie was kinda boring the entire time when they're inside the ark. Another problem is that none of the characters never referred to God as God or the Lord. They only refer to him as the Creator. The director was afraid to put the ""G"" word in his movie, but wasn't afraid to put freakin rock monsters in it.Throughout the movie they keep showing that scene of the snake, and Adam and Eve. The snake was probably the fakest snake I've ever seen. Adam and Eve looked like they were made of gold. The forbidden fruit looked like a heart and it was pulsing like one.I still remember all the moaning and groaning I heard in the theater. Right before the movie ends and the credits start, everybody was already getting up out of their seats and walking out. Not a good sign. Noah is a complete waste of time.

Okay no big deal right? Then why did they name it Moses? Has anybody seen regular television these days and seen it sink faster than an arc full of rocks with immorality and absolute violence and corruption.There's a reason for Noah to be exactly the trash that you see it. Television is controlled movies are controlled surely just as well. It's for you to decide if the controlling is good or is it evil? I'm not going to make up your mind for you! But haven't you seen a clear significant trend? But I agree with a lot of people here even if you hate religion this movie is just not going to do much for you.definitely not surprised by the complete misdirection and this also made it really difficult for any continuity in this movie. The actors were just your typical zombie acting and this movie definitely leaves you wondering.Have fun with this one I give it 0 out of 10,Noah

There is no logical reason, why its rating is above 6. I don't see it, it's like people watched another version than the one I just watched. I gave it 3, just because I felt pity on the different stars acting in it, nothing other than this.It is Noah's story man, it could be an artwork, it could be something really attractive, but I don't understand why the director decided to put it this way. The story is so lame, so weak, so unattractive, the thing that affected the performance of some of the best actors in the world, like Russell Crowe, you will see him in an unpleasant, unconvincing, and unsatisfying performance, and this was never the case with him. The same for Jennifer Connelly and the others.Before watching it, you need to know that it's a little bit far from the story we know. Personally, I don't have any single problem with the changing, but at least, if someone decided to change a great story like this, then change it in a logical, and beautiful way. If the main character of the movie is someone who has psychological problems, and a split in his personality, then maybe I would give the movie a higher rating:p.I will wait to see the story of Jesus from this director's perspective:p",Noah
567,Antoneo-Johnson,Inspired by the Bible,6,10 April 2014,"If you are expecting this movie to provide you with some sort of religious meaning and based on the Bible then you can forget it.The film was big on SFX, had A rated stars giving good performances but lacked substance as to why GOD chose Noah or why people are wicked. There was very little tense moments of suspense or character development. In the main the characters were blood thirsty showing little remorse for the loss of life.The technology used by the people was too advanced for that period You only have to look at the way soldiers and the people were dressed. How was the population sustained, where did they come from was not addressed?If you knew nothing of Noah you would better enjoy the movie. As the movie and characters were divorced from the Bible injecting major scenes and characters not found in the Bible.Its not clear why this movie was made other than its SFX as it gave no hope to mankind at the start and the end of the movie.",Noah

The Fountain, Black Swan, The Wrestler with the latter being a movie that stayed with me for a long time after I watched it.But this. Did Darren really direct this? I knew there was something wrong in the opening scene. The interplay between the young noah and his father was so dull. Then it got just got worse and not just a little worse but really bad.It's horrible. Terrible performances (to be fair kind of expected from Emma Watson) boring story, clichéd dialogue. Even the CGI looked like it was something from the 80's.It's just wrong. I just hope Darren gets back to his previous form with his next film. Maybe stay away from studios for a while.In a nutshell, too long, boring with a lead character you are supposed to be rooting for but wishing he would just die.",Noah
569,RyeDough,Ummm...,4,2 August 2014,"I guess it was always going to be difficult for those behind the movie to create a film that both stayed relatively true to the Bible's (admittedly brief) description of the life of Noah and that appealed in some way to a wide and not always theist audience. They sort of failed, however.One of the problems I suppose to much of the audience was that we already sort of new what would happen, and thus tension was practically nonexistent (although in saying that there have been some outstanding biographical films, so that's not really an excuse). The production team knew the story too, and this may be why they left the occasional hole in what was already a thin, stretched plot (for example, Noah has a couple of vague visions and immediately knows exactly what to do). There have been a few complaints about the giant Hulk-like rock angel things, and whilst they didn't necessarily need to be there, they at least fitted into the story (with a bit of a squeeze). They weren't the worst of the films problems anyway. Aesthetically the film was well shot, 80 percent of the time. Sequences of vast mountain ranges and lush green forests, silhouettes of the main characters superimposed on a beautiful sunset... all lovely. But the CGI animals? Good Lord they were abysmal! (Unintended Biblical reference by the way). The animals' heads moved side to side at the same time as if they were robots, and the scene itself only lasted a few seconds. I believe we spent more time watching Emma Watson and her friend stripping down for some... you know what (no nudity shown by the way). They were 'doing it' only about 10 feet away from Noah's grandfather which is as creepy as the old man himself. Living in a cave and spending the entire film searching the ground for a berry. What is that about?I hate to disappoint those of you expecting Noah to be a kind, nature loving man. Wait... oh no sorry that's exactly what he was for the first half hour, until he started killing people. (SPOILER COMING UP) And at the end(ish) of the film, when he went to kill the daughters of Emma (yeah that was an actual scene) he stopped because: ""All I could see was love."" CRINGE ALERT. To be honest, I would have preferred it if he had of actually killed them it was that cringe-worthy. Or better still if he had of jumped out of the T.V. and turned the film off it was that bad.It wasn't badly acted and the script was reasonable for the normal parts of the film (few and far between). The problems for me were; that it spent too much time on some sections and not enough on others (e.g. the animals), about half the film was spent with the camera rocking like a boat which just made me feel seasick and that it was just ludicrous. Fairly poor to be honest.",Noah

It had to look as bad on paper as it does in film.What... were the writers, directors and most of all the producers THINKING?

Even if you are just looking for a good movie to watch with no religious influences at all forget it! Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connely act like they believe in what there doing but that's about it. I hope and pray that this movie won't deter those that believe this is the way it was in the Bible and not get to know Christ because of it.

""Noah"" is a slap in the face for all Christians, making a mockery of the Bible story of Noah. The atheist director making it so clear that God does not exist. This being apparent through the fact that God is never used in the dialogue or that God never responds to Noah's questions. God should sue the studio for plagiarism. Because this movie only steels the story from the Bible and makes it into a Lord of the Rings wannabe film. I am shocked at the blatant disregard for the spirit of the story of Noah.

573,Strazdamonas,The way biblical stories should be done,8,8 September 2014,"This movie is a great example of how you do biblical stories for modern audience. You take a story, interpret it to reflect on modern actualities and make a good movie from it. Granted, the second part is far harder, but this movie pulled this off.It had religious posturing for the people that wanted that, it had the ever so popular dark themes, it had cultural shock, it had action scenes, it had drama. It was a movie for most audiences to accept.The actors also did a good job, especially the young ones, which is rare in a young actor. The only downside here could be the over-usage of The Watchers, as they were purely CGI and just did not fit in some scenes, however the more one-on-one scenes involving The Watchers were very well done.While the story does deviate from the actual biblical version, it does it for the sake of doing a better movie, which i find commendable. A movie is only better if it manages to become better for differing adaptation.Last point of why this movie is commendable is its layers of accessibility. A people who just look for an action flick will get one, however there are also deeper undertones in it as well for the more analyzing watcher.Overall i rate this movie an 8/10 - Great.",Noah
574,GideonPope,SPOILERS! Boring and Preachy. Close to walking out.,3,30 March 2014,"SPOILERS!!! So much was wrong with this movie . . . In sum, the movie tried way too hard to fit ""action"" and ""big war scenes"" into the plot. What resulted was a disjointed mess that was nothing more than borrowed, tired plot elements from 100 prior movies awkwardly amalgamated on a bible story.Quick list: The movie was either written by or funded by a vegan. Big message of the movie was - humans are less than animals, and we can only aspire to be as perfect as them. Noah is a vegan, as is his family. The bad guys all love meat. One bad guy eats a raw lizard, I think? Of course, the obvious contradiction here is that a huge portion of the ""perfect"" animals eat each other. Somehow, God is OK with a Chimp killing and eating a monkey by ripping it apart. Humans eating a goat is wrong, however.Reptile dog. What? Did we really need to see a dog with scales? Big Fight scene. Huh? Was this Lord of the Rings? There was no need for a big fight scene. It made the movie seem extremely contrived.Big Rock guys? Come on. Did they have to pay JRR Tolkien for these? They were, essentially, the tree things in Lord of the Rings, with a rock exterior instead of a tree exterior. Their speech was the same. Their movement was the same. LAME.Sparky rock fire ignitors? You know you have a sh-t movie when you have to try to add pop-rocks to it to try to bolster the interest level.Noah is willing to kill people but does not carry a weapon? Why not? Why is Hermione Granger in this? When did Methusaluh obtain miracle healing powers? The UBER-bad guy was just awful. Not a compelling character. Trying way to hard to be evil. Him finding a way into the ark was flat out stupid.If Noah wanted to end all human life, then the best way to have done it would have been to kill Hermione Granger as the only breeding female. Not kill her female children. Didn't it occur to Noah that he could drop dead of a heart attack and then Hermione and her lover, who looked about as much like Noah's son as Will Smith looks like John Madden, would crank out dozens of babies.How bad was this movie? Let me put it to you this way: a major subplot was that Noah determined that God wanted Noah to prevent humans from breeding. Noah changes his mind at the end, but for a good part of the movie Noah is preparing to kill breeding females if need be to do God's work.This movie was so bad I was cheering for Noah.One last thing - writing, directing, or acting the line ""do you realize what you have done"" should be grounds for being banned from ever being involved with a movie - forever.",Noah
575,bestactress-1,I found it genius at times and utterly ridiculous at other times.,7,31 March 2014,"I found Noah to be brilliant at times and utterly ridiculous at other times. It's thought provoking in a sense, it reminds me of many of today's self righteous vegans (not the good ones)  Who love animals but severely hate people based on their own self- righteousness.  They're so concerned with other people's wickedness that they can't even for a second concern themselves with their own.  Noah was exactly that. I've heard someone call that kind of behavior, ""can't smell your own sh!# on your knees"". In the film you see the outcome of that type of pre-occupation with judgment as it only leads to isolation, addiction, pain and suffering. That kind of truth and expression in a piece of art is brilliant. Since Moses wrote Genesis a few thousand years ago, and considering how relevant that message is today, I call that genius, I've always thought Moses was genius. Whether he did in fact live and write these amazing stories, that's not the point of this critique.Where does it get ridiculous? Well, you know how: many times people read a book and then go see a film based on the book and they come out saying the book was better than the movie? Well, that's exactly what happened here, except most people who've read the book of Genesis are religious and have a personal attachment to it. I'll ask you to silence all this religious argument and ignore the atheists as well, they're all the same, arguing non-sense ad-nauseam. They're literally two sides of the same coin. For the rest of us who are sane, who know that we don't know, who just went to see a movie based on a book we liked, the movie fails to deliver the goods in a sense, it deviates from a pretty good story and the dots get thrown all over the place. This is Aronofski's interpretation and I admire the man as an artist so I will respect it but I do wonder how the story would have been, had he stayed on course with the original and I think it would have definitely been better. Maybe a director out there will take another stab at it, I hope so and I will go see it again. With all that said the acting was brilliant, Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connely, and Anthony Hopkins, these actors always deliver, come on! The younger actors all held their own. It was certainly worth my time and money.",Noah

This movie is horrible for 2 simple reasons. First, if your going to make a fable about a world wide flood, just do it. Don't use the bible as the basis get real creative here and make it a sci-fi movie that is cool and entertaining and has amazing creatures and characters that we have never heard of before. Second, if your going to make a movie about the flood in the Christian bible than make a movie about the flood in the Christian bible. This movie is so far from the biblical account of Noah that it can't be taken serious by any true believer or historian. I could excuse artist license here and there, but come on this was just stupid. To the creators of this movie I can only say you can't mix oil and water and you can't mix God and Gandalf and expect to be taken serious.

578,cnkaufmann,"outstanding acting, cunning dialogue, lame storyline, discordant special effects, poor character development",4,1 April 2014,"The strengths of the movie were the outstanding acting and moral precepts. Russel Crowe was made to play Noah just as Charlton Heston was Moses and Mel Gibson was William Wallace. Anthony Hopkins as a mythical grandfather was convincing and Jennifer Connelly was powerful as a tormented trusting wife. The moral dilemmas that Noah battled to justify his actions, especially the conflict between his head and his heart were fascinating. His single-minded devotion to the portents of the Creator often conflict with his love of humanity. Noah's wife and children must blindly accept Noah's sacred visions as being received from the Creator, thus they must dutifully follow Noah's orders. Yet, she and her sons challenge the very purpose of justice in their duties to him when Noah follows the Creator's command to cleanse the world of man's evil so it may be born anew. This was more climatic than all the special effects combined.Overall, a weak story failed to engage me to the film. No rationale is given to explain why the Creator chose Noah for building an Ark to save all of earth's living creatures. How do all the animals arrive at the ark in unison two by two without anyone or any deity summoning them? Characters lack crucial development. When I see Methuselah, Noah's grandfather, being respected and followed like nobility I feel like I'm watching Luke Skywalker follow Yoda in Star Wars. How did Noah come to be so skilled in shipbuilding? Why is Noah's adversary, Tubal-Cain, a greedy, destructive barbarian? The failure to establish these characters own stories left their actions lacking in drama. Even more incongruous was the sudden introduction of the biblical Watchers -- giant ""Transformer-like"" beings with six arms made of stone that walk with the gait of a Star Wars Imperial Walker, and radiate beams of bright orange light when struck in battle. A colossal anachronism and mistake. When the Bible tells of Watchers being ""mighty beings"" one would expect mortals with the strength of Hercules, not 100 foot high monsters. Then, to build the ark in eight years, instead of Noah summoning craftsmen from villages the director, Darren Aronofsky, has these biblical watchers build it, hewing trees like they're toothpicks. Absurd! The battle scene at the end looks like a war scene from Transformers, not one fought by mortals. And, months of rain from the sky would justify a great flood but to have cataclysmic gushers sprout from a barren ground like a volcano is nonsense. The scenes of flooding waters were the only believable special effects I saw and really were the only special effects necessary to tell Noah's story. For reasons I fail to understand, filmmakers think louder and massive are more important than a convincing story. As a biblical film it is about 20% of what the Ten Commandments was and as an action adventure film it is about 10% of what Raiders of the Lost Ark was.",Noah
579,matthewaos,An interesting movie but maybe not great,7,2 August 2014,"I don't really care for religious films. I liked ""Jesu of Nazareth"", but mostly because the acting was great. I am also a big aronofsy fan. I was intrigued to watch ""Noah"" mostly because I have faith in Darren doing a good movie.Most people are familiar with Noah's story, at least the basic. That gives the movie a head start on the narrative so to not explain everything. This however is what I didn't like in the movie, cause if I had no idea about Noah I would be kind of lost. It is a little difficult to be attached with the characters cause there ids not much time spent in understand them. My other problem is that I was expecting the movie to be more metaphorical, taking the story we all know and make it something else. I can't buy that someone takes orders from an invisible master who however does not speak and does not question authority. The whole concept of masters and slaves who only do their master'd biding seems silly to me. I would prefer if there was a more obvious question if there is a god giving orders or if Noah is just crazy. I have only see this movie once and I think I must watch it again. However I was not really impressed, nor I disliked it. I think it's the one so far I like less from Darren's work. However do not fool yourself, it's a good movie dealing with survival's guilt, environmentalism and spirituality. It just does not really fit well with my beliefs, but I enjoy watching it.",Noah
580,hjahangiry,Noah (2014),7,20 August 2014,"""In the beginning there was nothing."" Says Noah when he describes the creation to his family while they are floating on the water surrounded Earth. As I was watching Noah (2014) my mind got filled with lots of questions and yet new ideas of brilliance about the truth of what was going on in the past of humankind and of course the past of creation. From the fallen angels who disobeyed the creator to help human and therefor were punished to be transformed from light and trapped into bodies of stones until they got released asking the creator to forgive them and ascended back to the heaven, it made me realize how ungrateful human is and yet how stupid it could be. It, the movie, also solved some of my questions. Temptation led him to eat the forbidden fruit, and descended him to the Earth, it began to kill his own kind and turned the world into a planet of horror. But after generations there comes a man of light whose task is to lead the world into a new beginning by wiping the ugliness of generation of disobeying people off the face of the Earth having them all sunk. The creator chooses him to finish what was left to be done  but soon he realizes there is a choice to let it go on with mankind life or to abort the existence of it. Emotionally struggled between his feelings for his family and his will to do the right with the creator, Noah says to him ""I will not fail you"" and repeats it three times determined to end the violence brought to the Earth by man abusing the knowledge that fallen angels had given to them of creation. There are many great scenes in the movie but for me, there was nothing more tremendous than to see the sudden bloom of a flower by a drop of rain or the sudden growth of trees from a barren land which compelled me to think about the majesty of the creator once again but this time deeper from a clearer view; there is nothing that he can't do. However, before the movie was over the idea that how different and perhaps diverted the story and the characters of Noah and his family members are from the original ones I had heard came to my mind. It had lots of paradoxes with what was narrated in Muslims' Quran and although I am no familiar with the real Bible but I can say it for certain that it is in contradiction with it to. For instance the long age of Noah comes to the mind that no evidence of it could be seen in the movie. It seems that the writers (Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel) haven't done a complete research for a project that its name proceeds the whole Cinema in history genre put together. When I saw Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly playing together in A Beautiful Mind (2001) as a couple whose relationship was disturbed by the hallucinated imaginations of Dr. Nash (Russell Crowe), I was so amused by their realistic and amazing performance and now to see them back together again in Noah, I can't think of any other couple of actors who could play the roles as good as they did. The visual effects, on the other hand, are not so eye catching comparing to the previous works of Paramount Pictures like Titanic (1997). The animals could easily be found as immaturely animated and the species like the cats are hidden from the eyes in the majestic entrance of the animals into the arc. I think The Ten Commandments' (1956) creators would be doing a better yet more realistic job of making Noah. Of course it was in no compare with Darren Aronofsky's previous jobs like Black Swan (2010). However, to sum up nearly 2000 years of Noah's life and capture it in a 2+ hour feature with a though diverted but a rather straight storyline without any excess inclination in it was an absolutely daring work that Darren did.",Noah
581,tvonfrank,Actually not a bad movie,7,25 August 2014,"Was looking forward to see this movie for some time now. First 10 minutes or so, after seeing these moving rocks-humans-robots-angels, whatever they were and that weird dog/cat/dragon - I thought (not expecting to see all that weirdness), OK... I think I have better things to do now, but I continued to watch and after a short while I thought, wait a minute it's not that bad after all. All that weirdness might be just the way that guy, Noah, is either dreaming it, or that's the way Mr. Aronovsky is interpreting the bible. Now, I'm not a religious person, far from it, but I did read the bible(s) (parts of it) as part of my university studies and one think what I've learned from it is that you can't take it seriously and you can interpret it any way you want - bible was written by a pagan and re-written so many times that basically nobody knows what the hell is going on there and only certain things can be taken seriously or as a source of information i.e. a person named Jesus did live in certain part of Palestine, which back then was part of Roman Empire and now is Israel, this information is backed both by the Bible and Roman manuscripts except Bible depicts Him as the God and the Romans as a trouble maker who was sentenced to death by crucifixion (at that time only serious criminals and people considered a serious threat to the Roman Empire were punished that way). But going back to the movie, if you are a right wing religious fanatic, which takes the Bible as the only source of information then don't watch the movie, some things depicted there might simply offend you but if you are an open minded person who enjoys all kinds of movies, sometimes little bit weird, or just a person who likes to watch movies then give it a try and I'm sure you'll like it. Basically I don't understand how a religious person could be offended by that movie - the movie doesn't depict the God bad in any way and his name is mentioned no more than in any other Hollywood big budget movie I have seen. The movie does show a little bit of violence and might not be suitable for everyone to watch, though.",Noah

Divine assignment, selfless duty, collecting animals, building the arc etc. What I see is a heavily gender biased story of men fighting for whatever they always fight for: food, women and survival. In a post-apocalyptic geography, a family with three boys finds a girl who was wounded severely; the man receives a message from the creator and the story proceeds. Everything set. When you remove the layers of corruption and destruction, the plot is pretty much simple. However, the enthusiasm on finding wives for the boys overwhelmingly regulates the entire motivation of the family. First boy is lucky, they already found the wounded girl (Emma Watson is chosen to lure the young boys/girls to the theater), the second boy wants one for himself and develop daddy-issues since there is no one available (well he literally sneaked in other peoples' private camp to grab one, yet nope!), third is too young to think about sex or reproduction. Anyways, the movie ends soon after the natural disaster and Emma gives birth to twin sisters whom will be wives of someone, may be the third kid? I don't know.The point is, there is no historic-mythical-story-telling or any good acting at all to admire and enjoy. None. I am highly disappointed.",Noah

Noah was unlike the Biblical story whatsoever; if it was going to be named Noah, at least make it Biblical, put some events that happened in the Bible into the movie. If I had no idea what the Biblical story is about, I would think the movie is very well--done and well-written, because it is, but because I know exactly what the story was, I couldn't comprehend why they made Noah look like the bad guy. And not only was Noah looked at as the bad guy, but Gd looked like the bad guy as well. Gd never told Noah to kill his own grandchild. That part of the story was made up to create more drama in the movie, as is the other half of the movie. As I mentioned before, if I had no religious beliefs when seeing this movie, I would maybe like it because the action and drama, but because of a biased opinion, I thought this movie would stay true to its name and tell us the story of Noah and was very disappointed when I saw that the whole story was changed.

585,coltonvaughn10,Epic with one real mistake,5,28 March 2014,"Noah is a phenomenal movie that stars the amazing Russell Crowe and a dynamic supporting cast that consists of Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, and Anthony Hopkins. With that being said, let's start with the bad in the movie.Accuracy: I believe Noah's story should never be made into a movie because Noah gets 5 chapters in the Bible, and even then you don't get a lot on him. So there is a LOT of blank to fill to have a movie. I didn't like somethings because they weren't as I pictures or entirely accurate to the story. And don't get me started the fallen angels. That was just ridiculous!Now for the good.Acting: The cast is AMAZING! Crowe owns Noah, and everyone else nails their parts as well. Emma Watson and Logan Lerman get their scenes, even though they were limited, and they steal them. Jennifer Connelly was as good as ever in her limited screen time, and so was Anthony Hopkins.Effects: The effects will get an Oscar nomination. They were amazing. They looked real, and I mean really real! Nothing more to tell about them.Directing: It was great! The dream sequences were perfected, the landscape shots were awesome, and the way the film was shot was great! As a whole, it was a great movie, but it wasn't fully accurate. But no one knows what happened in Noah's story outside the Bible telling us, so we fill in the blanks like the director did. It was a great movie, I recommend it. It's a good time for both believers and nonbelievers. Go see it!",Noah
586,kupo77,Terrible movie,1,29 March 2014,"Really bad movie, this movie should be called ""Supernova from hell"" ,because it has nothing to do with the bible.For example, fallen angels (demons) are helping the earth and are the good guys,while God (who is always called ""the creator"" from an atheist storyteller point of view it seems), is the evil, bad mood character. Seems to me those who made the movie are atheists under satanic influence. The demons are supposed to be the victims and you are to feel sorry for them. (That exactly my point on the satanic influence, basically portraying God as evil, and further explaining why the author doesn't like God. Then after the demons die, they go back to Heaven XD, this is just ridiculous.Don't get me started on the story, i mean i don't care if its changed, because the true story itself is very short, but atheists are filling in the blanks, with their bitterness towards their image of God, which is none.In the bible, Noah's 3 sons all had wives in the ark, the people that were flooded did NOT want anything to with God, as a matter of fact they mocked Noah for creating the ark for years. For 120 years Noah was telling them about God and warning them to repent from their ways. But the king in the movie, was not against God, he wanted to have fellowship with God and was rejected, therefore the bitterness from the author clearly emerged, infused with lies about who God is. Not displaying how merciful God really is but completely the opposite.Also this movie is gray and boring, so serious and no happiness, which righteous people are supposed to be so much more happier but thats just my opinion. This movie comes from the opinion that what God made is bad and rotten, and we should make our own ""beauty and creation"", mocking God and being gods in our own eyes, which is exactly why those demons were cast down in the first place. And they are the ones that corrupt the minds of people and are the creepy psychotic creatures that make all the evil in the world. What satanic influence tries to convey, is the opposite, where the demons are victims and because God is ""omnipotent"" he must be the reason of the all the bad things in the world.I could continue along time with all the silliness from this movie. I actually find this fiction to be too stupid to be taken seriously and gives me more reason to laugh.",Noah

588,thedriver829,"A Twist On The Noah Tale That May Not Be For Everyone, But Still Delivers An Impact Of Biblical Proportions",9,3 December 2014,"There has been a lot of Christianity-based films released here in 2014 (Son Of God, Exodus: Gods And Kings), but none of them have spawned as much controversy than Noah. Darren Aronofsky's take on the Old Testament depiction of the flood that wiped out humanity definitely takes its liberties, inserting more fantastical elements such as fallen angels made out of rock and subplots involving Noah and his questions about the morality of humanity and whether it deserves to survive after the flood. These changes may and have driven a lot of folks away, but they don't stop Noah from being an epic film of biblical proportions.Though it's his first tackle with a big budget Hollywood film, Noah still carries Darren Aronofsky's signature style, particularly in its visuals. The effects are big and spectacular (though some of the animal effects could have been worked on), the locations look outstanding, and the cinematography looks absolutely outstanding. There are shots shown in silhouette that look like a work of art, and the film does carry some of the grim tones that Aronofsky is known for.While many may complain that the movie is too liberal with its changes to the story, it never feels as though these changes were made in order to be blasphemous or to anger Christians. Instead, they keep the viewer interested, unknowing, wanting to know what is going to happen next. And while these additions are prevalent, the movie never sacrifices themes commonly found in the Bible, such as mankind's depravity and the hope for redemption.The acting is also top notch in this movie, with not a single weak performance. Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances, and plays the tortured character of Noah perfectly. Anthony Hopkins, for the little that he is in here, is mesmerizing as Methuselah, Noah's grandfather. Emma Watson really shines her, continuing to show that she is more than just Hermione from Harry Potter. Ray Winstone also gives a compelling performance as the film's main villain Tubal- Cain.Noah may not be the most biblically accurate movie ever made (which what movie in Hollywood is?), but it's certainly a compelling, investing, and well-made film worthy of Darren Aronofsky's continually-amazing filmography. It makes changes to the story while still retaining its message, provides fantastic performances and visuals, and keeps the viewer guessing and gets their mind thinking long after the film. It's not going to touch with everybody, but as a film, it succeeds in bringing us an epic but thought-provoking piece of work.",Noah
589,kalgo-725-870078,That was surprisingly fantastic!,9,13 July 2014,"I really liked this film, and so did most of my family. I actually would rate it an 8.1, but up-rated it to help offset the haters' low ratings. It delivered what we expect from a Russel Crowe movie, which is all good. He has a knack for choosing great projects, and he delivered his usual awesome performance. Jennifer Connelly was wonderful and the others were all strong. The script was simple, honest, straightforward. To read other reviews, and see that the average rating is only in the low 6s, I find that the film has polarized audiences; those who loved, and those who hated. This must be due to it's being a biblical tale. It has been said that it is the biblical Noah story without God, but God is constantly in this story, creating unexplainable miracles and speaking to Noah through dreams. I guess if you refer to God as the Creator, then that is not good enough? I don't understand why literal-believing christians would waste their time seeing a film like this when they should know that they will be disappointed. The original tale from the bible is one that defies the laws of nature, just as much of the old testament does, and this movie interprets the story in interesting ways. In it's way, it helps the tale have more grounding in natural laws, while introducing us to a pre-deluge world which is different from our own, with the evidence of this world, I suppose, being washed away by the flood's destruction, like refuse on a beach being washed away by the ocean waves. This ancient and unknown world has strange metals that the humans harvest, and the ancient race of man is surprisingly, and interestingly, more advanced than we would normally expect. The watchers add a lot, including helping make the construction of the enormous ark seem more believable. The natural landscape and background of the movie is beautiful and desolate, almost alien looking, again, I think, giving us a glimpse of this unknown-to-us world. I presume that the earth appears desolate because the tribe of Cain has made it that way, similarly to how the armies of Alexander the Great laid waste to vast forests, creating deserts, as resources were consumed for his war machine. I had tears in my eyes during some scenes, while my wife sat next to me and said she felt nothing. To the Christian audience, I say, when selecting your biblical films, determine if the filmmakers are christians like you and stick to those films. If not, then expect a creative adaptation that will not be pleasing to you, and then you need not rush to poorly rate films that the rest of us enjoy, as creative people express their creativity. I am not going to rush out to watch a christain film, and then write a terrible review because the film was exactly what I expected! And do me a favor and don't waste your time going to see the new Moses movie(Exodus:Gods and Kings) by Ridley Scott, as I can assure you it will disappoint you, and probably delight me, unless it is like his awful Prometheus film. lol On the other hand, perhaps the christians feel that if movie makers are going to use their bible, then just follow it and don't deviate, make up your own stories, which I suppose is fair. lol",Noah
590,fgold-743-259474,Noah Asks Us to Look at Ourselves,8,31 March 2014,"While the noise around the film, Noah, seems to be focused on biblical authenticity; it seems to really ask the question are we, as humans on earth back to the point of another cleansing? With more than thirty hours of religion classes in college, I began a thirty year quest seeking the sub-text in the bible (sorry folks from Constantine to King James...the bible we read today, is most likely not what was the oral tradition or actually the written word from the days of Abraham to the life of Christ), as well as, other ancient texts.The cross-cultural references to a great flood, predate the classical biblical story and this film brings all the context of the cradle of man's desire to dominate others, including all the creatures of the earth. Early in the film, we see Noah sharing the ethical challenge with his sons, ""We only take what we need"", as a clear reference to our over- resourced and over-industrialized global ""village"". The greatest treat of Noah, is the visual story telling of the creation story, the ""Big Bang"" is so beautifully crafted.Throughout the telling of Noah, we feel a pull to ask if we need to be killing other creatures to survive and most importantly, the ethical challenge of literally killing our fellow man or brother. We may all agree we haven't emerged far from the primitive communal fire and this film asks the question are we due for another cleansing.In the spirit of all those seekers, the film brought me back home from the movie theater to my well worn bible. I am eager to rekindle my quest to understand more fully the beauty of these great stories of miracles found in the Hebrew Old Testament and New Testament. Watching the fallen angels find their way back to heaven, was haunting.Don't discount Noah by getting hung-up on a true biblical translation. This film is courageous and beautiful in the telling of what we need to be reminded of today, the care and feeding of all creatures and this beautiful earth.",Noah
591,john44233,"During the making of this entire movie,somewhere, someone got careless.",1,11 January 2015,"I was really looking forward to seeing Russell Crowe again. I really give him props for an excellent performance in Gladiator, 3:10 to Yuma was exceptional, and I have a copy of Cinderella Man, good flicks. For some reason or another though Mr. Crowe respectively doesn't pull through for me like I expected him to. He kind of comes of as unstable and kind of insane. I can't put all the blame on him, I mean obviously the director and writer, Darren Aronofsky, kind of made his bed with this one. Never allow someone like that to make a movie who's title and story revolve around religion.Back to the movie. I would say if your really religious and don't just say you are, then this movie is definitely not for you. Stay away, you'll only end up angry and worse off then when you came in. However, if your Atheist or your religion doesn't revolve around God then I would say have fun, you'll probably rate this movie higher.All in all I'm very disappointed at the way this movie turned out. My views: Darren went to church for the first time in his life to find out about Noah, Ended up with the story, Sat in a daze for months trying to SHOCK and AWE people with his own little script in the story while failing miserably and pissing a lot of religious people off on the process. Darren, next time you take a story and change it to whatever you want, make sure to change the title. Maybe -Another Ark- or -40 days of rain- would have been more appropriate. However I can understand from a business point of view.......How do you sell something that's crap? Make it sound good.",Noah
592,mcmillan_peter,"Darren, what have you done?",5,3 December 2014,"I don't know where to start, I had so many expectations from the director and the cast, so in no particular order: Editing - sketchy at best - some odd blackout cuts, some that looked high school at best. Direction - sad, sad sad. Where was this movie supposed to be going - certainly didn't follow the bible, seemed more like a bad version of transformers at times (Michael Bay wannabe maybe?), I felt sorry for the actors who had so little to work with. Acting - well, the dialog was awful to begin with, so I will give them a break, but all have done so much better in other movies it was sad to see them struggle so. Russell Crowe brought the best performance, but that's really not saying much. The rock people all acted better... Cinematography was sadly weak given such biblical material - the flood was over and done all too quickly (but took about nine months in real time apparently), the closing rainbows were appalling. And that's it - in a nutshell a weird sci-fi biblical epic gone terribly wrong. Your mileage might vary...",Noah
593,kevindpetty,Was a 4 until the last 20 minutes; turned to a 2,2,23 May 2014,"Aronofsky is one of the great directors and auteurs in contemporary world cinema. I always count on his movies to be memorable and aesthetically and intellectually challenging. Noah did not seem like the kind of vehicle a great director would choose unless s/he 1) was making a blockbuster for some reason or, 2) wanted to make a statement about how humans have ruined the world yet again, as in Noah's time.The latter is what seemed to be the plot through most of the movie: Noah and his clan are never seen eating meat; Noah admonishes his young son for picking a flower because the flowering plant is a living being; they stop to rescue a fallen girl (who becomes Noah's daughter-in-law Ila) in peril of their own lives; genuinely care about the welfare of humans and animals.By contrast, the children of Cain are monstrous narcissists who turned the landscape into wastelands pitted with tree stumps; torture and kill women and children; abuse and kill animals because they believe the world is there for them to do as they want; warlike, killing even the angels who came to Earth to help them.This is a codified storyline that seems to posit that humans have fallen from grace as again as they did in the Garden of Eden. It goes even further though. Noah believes that God has decided that humans cannot be given anymore chances and, therefore, must not be allowed to continue as a species. This makes sense because following the plot so far, in a new Eden, humans would just turn into children of Cain and destroy everything again.Now the story starts falling apart. Ila is supposed to be barren; however, just before the flood, Methuseleh magically made her fertile. On the ark, Ila becomes pregnant. Noah is distraught because he believed God did not want humans to exist any longer. Noah asks God what he should do. It seems that God wants Noah to kill Ila's child if it turns out to be a girl presumably to prevent the human race from continuing. Makes sense. Why would God wipe out all but 6 humans on Earth if He thought humans were capable of behaving themselves? The clan immediately takes side against Noah in favor of the unborn child.Why would a devout son of God - Methuseleh - go against God's wishes by making Ila fertile? Why would Noah's family take offense at Noah's wish to potentially kill female offspring when all that has happened to this point shows that Noah has been chosen by God to do His will, and His will evidently includes killing his grandchild? The babies are born and they are both girls. However, even though God told him to kill female offspring, Noah cannot because when he looks at them, he says ""all I feel is love"" or some sort of maudlin sentiment like that.When the ark finally makes land, Noah becomes a drunken hermit briefly because he has defied God, until his wife leads him back to the fold. Noah then gives a silly speech to his granddaughters (nobody but a newborn could stand to listen to it without rolling their eyes) about how they must make sure that humans are good for now on and that he trusts they will do their duty out of Love.The same old all pervasive Love motif, which is fine EXCEPT four-fifths of the movie has been about how the worst aspects of humanity always win out over their capacity to Love. Even more ridiculous is that as Noah is driveling on, we see shots of birds feeding their babies, lionesses licking their cubs, etc. - like something out of a Disney film - implying that humans are just like all other creatures because we all love in the peaceable jungle.And then the clincher: The sky starts radiating rainbows like a joyous sonic boom. Obviously God has changed his mind. He was done with humans and wiped most of them out, but Noah's Hallmark card eloquence has convinced him otherwise. Nonsense. So disappointed.",Noah
594,madison-singfiel,Actual Event vs. Movie,2,18 July 2014,"First off let me say that I'm a Christian. All in all this was a pretty good movie. The effects were awesome. The plot was a good biblical event. But it was like the creators took the event and threw it out the window. I understand that they had very little to go off of but I think that they could have done a better job of sticking to what little text there was, such as all three sons were married. The creators also didn't really stick to the morals of the day and age. Noah and his family were devout Christians and so I think that Shem getting Ila pregnant before they were married was a big mistake. As well as the scenes in the woods were they almost had sex. That was the main thing that made me mad. Also I don't think that Noah would have wanted to kill his grandchild or children. It would have been a gift from God. And Noah, I don't think, would have wanted to throw that gift back at God. Noah and his family followed Jesus devoutly. That's why they were given a warning so they could escape the flood. But the creators dirtied up their image. They made them seem much more like the people that were killed in the flood and they weren't. Noah and his family followed God. I'm not saying that his family was better than the others but I feel like they wouldn't have done the things that they did in this. But that's just my opinion...",Noah

I was clock watching from 10 minutes in and could not believe how slow time passed, when the end credits came up I almost cheered with relief. Such a strong cast....wasted.... they must be regretting signing up to this venture. All are great actors in their own right, but the plot, script and effects (CGI) combined to undermine all of their performances. This was meant to be a modern biblical epic, but unfortunately it looked old and dated before it was released, without any of the flair. I understand that bible stories can be a bit dry to make into films, but this telling of Noah's Ark was just plain bad.",Noah
596,siru-tirronen,For a long time a magnificent performance by Russell Crowe,9,19 April 2014,"I admit: when I first heard that there would be a movie about Noah I rolled my eyes. Even when I saw the trailer, I didn't get interested. I'm not a religious person, so the problem wasn't that the director would shame the biblical story. I was worried because I didn't believe that anyone could put life on Noah's character, that old good uncle kind of character. Luckily I went to the movies and I saw that all my doubts were wrong. Russell Crowe has done great work and I sure hope that he will get rewarded for this film. His Noah is HUMAN: imperfect and selfish, and the way Russell Crowe expresses his changing feelings... It was so good to see him acting so multiple feelings, not just stone faced warrior stuff. The story was better than I had expected so I don't have problems with that. Of course some scenes were too much( the have to be religious stuff) and I loved that the director was brave enough to test this ancient story's borders. But my stars come for Russell's acting. I enjoyed this film and it has been a while when I had to watch the movie so excited wondering what will happen next(even when I knew there would be a happy ending). So If you are a Russell Crowe fan and you're not too religious person, go see this movie.",Noah
597,MovieGuy92,Not a particularly good movie.,5,19 August 2014,"I want you to imagine the original story of Noah from the Bible. Got it? Now, take that story and add every ridiculous element you can think of and make Noah himself as unlikable as you possibly can. What are you left with? This movie. I wanted to like it, I really did, but this film was just so inane and, well, silly, that it's hard to defend. Okay, we all know the story of Noah, right? Near the beginning of time, not long after Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden, mankind had fallen into sin, all except for Noah and his family. Thus, God commissions Noah to build a giant boat known as an Ark in order to save him, his family, and two of each kind of animal from the flood that will wipe out the rest of mankind's wickedness. This movie somewhat follows that, except here God (known simply as ""The Creator"" in the movie) never actually speaks to Noah, but rather the latter has a rather ambiguous dream about the world perishing in water, which sparks him to build the Ark. To complicate things, a tribe of sinful barbarians, led by a villain known as Tubal-Cain, decides he wants to use the Ark to save himself and his tribe, to which Noah declines, sparking the main conflict of the movie. This is all well and good, after all the original story is rather short, so they have to add some subplots to stretch it out into a feature-length film. However, aside from this the rest of the movie majorly jumps the shark (or, sails an Ark over it, rather). I haven't even mentioned that there are sentient rock giants called ""Watchers"", who are supposedly fallen angels, that help Noah construct the Ark. Noah also is in possession of some sort of magical snakeskin that I guess belonged to the snake that tempted Adam and Eve, though I have no idea of its function. The movie never really explains it. I could actually forgive all this, after all this wouldn't be the first dumb fantasy actioner I've watched. However the movie commits its worst sin in the second half after the flood has erupted. During this time, the movie makes Noah into the biggest asshole you will ever see in the role of protagonist, almost to the point to where he could be considered a villain. Okay, so apparently Noah has it in his head at this point that God (sorry, ""The Creator"") wants to eradicate ALL of mankind, including him and his family, so not only does he allow the woman his son loves to die pre-flood, but later he gives his entire family a somber speech about how they will be the last and that the youngest will bury the next eldest and then die alone. But if that weren't enough, later he finds out that his adopted daughter Ila has ended up pregnant. At this point, Noah turns into a full on psychopath by threatening to kill the child if it's a girl, as she could then theoretically carry on the human race. Sure enough, twin girls are born and Noah pursues Ila to try and kill the infants, even going as far as to destroy her escape raft when she attempts to flee. Of course, predictably, he doesn't kill the children due to a last-minute change of heart, but come on, we're supposed to be ROOTING for this guy! How are we supposed to cheer on someone who's trying to slaughter infants? I guess it's understandable then that I was sort of half-rooting for Tubal-Cain in the final battle.I guess if this movie had any redeeming qualities, it would be that the special effects were pretty good, even if they were used to animate rock creatures and other goofy magical elements. The acting was also not bad, you could tell the actors were really trying their best to make the movie work, but when the script itself is faulty, the actors can only do so much to save it. This was a movie that should have worked. The story of Noah is really a fascinating one and seems like one of the easiest Biblical stories to adapt to the big screen. If its creators had only toned down all the fantasy stuff and not made Noah a psychopath, then I think this could have been a great film. As is, it's a wasted opportunity and a reminder of what could have been.",Noah
598,WordWeaver777,"""Fringe"" Meets the Bible: What Was Aronofsky Thinking?",2,16 July 2014,"Like many thousands of other people who viewed this movie, my initial reaction upon reaching its conclusion was ""What in the world was that?"" So many other negative reviews have been written regarding this disastrous film, that I will try to spare you the burden of reading all of the same criticisms once again . . . well, except for a few.The minute that the so-called ""rock giants"" appeared in the early moments of the film, I realized that this movie was in serious trouble; and from that point forward, it was simply downhill to the very end.From rock giants, to mysterious glowing stones, to a magical seed which sprouts an entire forest in seconds, to a storm which goes from rain drops to gigantic ocean waves encompassing the Ark in mere seconds, to Noah himself being depicted as a maniacal psychopath who is bent on making sure that the entire human race perishes, everything about this film is wrong, wrong, wrong.I haven't even addressed the Biblical inaccuracies yet.For example, any Bible-knowledgeable person knows that all three of Noah's sons had wives prior to entering into the Ark. Thus, the Scriptures teach us that eight people were saved from the flood waters.While both the Book of Enoch and the KJV Bible mention the Watchers -- see Daniel 4:17 -- the Fallen Angels who are mentioned in Genesis, and the Watchers who are mentioned in Daniel, are not the same beings. According to the writers Enoch, Peter and Jude, the Fallen Angels were in fact imprisoned in the bowels of the Earth in order to await judgment from God. Like so many other things in this film, the rock giants were a fabrication of Aronofsky's warped imagination.Neither is Darwinian macroevolution supported in the Bible.There are other Biblical inaccuracies in this movie, but I will leave it at that.Regarding the actors, I have long admired the work of the main cast of characters; i.e., Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins and Ray Winstone, and to some degree, Emma Watson as well. However, I can't for the life of me figure out what inspired any of them to lend their collective talents to this horrible film. I believe that they all gave good performances; and I do not blame them directly for the dismal failure of this film. The fault lies with the story itself, and with its writers Aronofsky and Handel, in my view.After much contemplation, I have arrived at a satisfactory conclusion regarding why this movie failed so miserably.Please excuse my sarcasm and tongue-in-cheek.Quite simply, ""Noah"" was really not meant for us. Somehow, Darren Aronofsky apparently became confused. Thus, he thought that he was writing an episode for the popular TV show ""Fringe"". In other words, this movie was really meant for the people who inhabit that Alternate Universe. Perhaps in THEIR universe, Aronofsky's film is how the story of Noah and the Flood unfolded, but it certainly didn't occur that way in OUR universe.In conclusion, once again Hollywood has demonstrated its arrogance, and its lack of respect for the Holy Scriptures. After having watched so many Biblically-themed movies over the decades, I can only conclude that it is not that Hollywood is incapable of making Biblically-accurate movies. After all, they definitely have the money and the resources to conduct in-depth research. It is simply that they don't want to. They like to chop up and distort the truth, and twist the actual facts, if it results in attracting the masses and earning a greater profit.In Aronofsky's case, it is a double tragedy. While some reviewers here have pointed out that Aronofsky is an atheist, upon conducting my own limited research, I discovered that he comes from a Jewish background, and that both his parents are Conservative Jews. While Aronofsky notes that ""there was very little spiritual attendance in temple"", being Conservative Jews, one would think that his parents would have at least imparted to him an accurate, Scripture-based story of Noah and the Ark.If so, it certainly doesn't show in this movie. This film should really be called ""Noah, According to Darren Aronofsky"".",Noah
599,flouxde34,This is not bad !,7,6 September 2014,"This is just my opinion.OK, it is difficult to review this movie as it is difficult to make a movie about a biblical tale. Darren Aronofsky chose to shot this movie about Noah's ark, he wanted to do that and he did it well. Of course he knew that there would be some disputes about the fact that he adapt a biblical tale with his own way. But this is the cinema of Darren Aronofky. If you watch this movie, do not think about all the religious context but watch it like a normal story, like a normal film.As a normal film, it is good. All the frames are worked. The landscapes are beautiful. This a really impressive movie. The battles are very well directed. We can say that the movie is a visual movie.OK there are many imperfections, there are for example many scenes which are too long, sometimes, it become a bit boring I admit. But the film has nothing to be hated. Aronofsky tried to offer the best of his work.The actors are good. Russel Crowe did a very good job as Noah, we understand perfectly all the psychological troubles of the character. So if it is not your kind of movie do not watch it, but if you want to try, watch Noah for what it is and not for something else. I confess, I did not really want to watch the movie but finally, I was right to do so. Watch Noah as a fiction like all the movies and watch it thinking that is just the director's vision and I am pretty sure that you will not hate the movie.",Noah

The acting was great, the cinematography beautiful but this was simply a work of fiction, not the Bible story. There were fallen angels called Watchers that looked like beat up transformers that built the ark and were redeemed by helping Noah and in a fight against Tubal-Cain (Cain's grandson) were sent back to Heaven... Nope, that's not what happens with the fallen watcher angels!Noah basically goes insane due to survivors guilt and believes they all must die so leaves Ham and Japheth without wives... Noah, in the Bible was a very righteous man who heard from God. Noah is this story has some dreams and then stops hearing from God.... So he goes to his grandfather Methuselah for help (poor Methuselah is living like a hermit)! But Noah seems to go crazy anyway... He gets it in his head that all mankind including his family are to die. No need for Ham and Japheth to have wives... Then he plans to kill his two twin granddaughters by Shem, who marries a gal Noah rescued and raised as his child. I didn't mind this addition to the story. The wives came from somewhere. His wife tells him if He kills his grandbaby's that she will never forgive him and that his sons will hate him. Ham already hates him because he let the woman he liked be killed by Tubal-Cain's army.And then there is Tubal-Cain on the ark, butchering animals- SERIOUSLY? So, all in all, I was pretty disappointed as was my hubby. The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston also took some creative license but left the basic story alone... There is NO REASON Hollywood couldn't have done the same with Noah. Time for a remake by someone who understands the real story. In telling the Genesis story Noah somehow mixes things up a bit... Oh, and then there is the vegetarian thing - the bad guys eat meat, the good guys (Noah et al) are vegetarians. In Genesis 9 God is fine with Noah eating meat... I think whoever wrote the movie script forgot to read the Bible story.If you want to see a well acted but depressing work of fiction then you might like the movie, but for me...

This was before Freud, so he interpreted it literally. Armed with this hunch and disturbing zeal, but lacking specific details (no mention of cubits, for example), he constructs a large, multi-tiered floating coffin with the aid of rock giants on loan from The Hobbit. This, he wagers, will ensure the survival of his small, dysfunctional family, as well as that of the multitude of creatures who show up in pairs and are checked in, no questions asked. Possibly the beasts had the same dream as Noah.Disturbingly, the animals are gassed upon arrival, presumably to ensure a docile temperament, and they fall into a deep sleep. This is a clever plot device that neatly side-steps questions that naturally arise when thousands of animals are cohabiting on the same ""boat"" as Noah and his motley crew: How do the animals get the exercise they need to survive while being confined to tight quarters for forty days? Who changes the litter? Where do they find new litter? How do you feed them? What do you feed them? Where do they get fresh water? How to prevent altercations among the animals, some of whom are specifically designed to eat one another? And so on.The message is clear: They are in a deep, drug-induced sleep, so who cares?Another plus is that once gassed, the awful ruckus that likely would have been made by the unruly beasts is avoided, making it easy for the audience to hear the crackling dialogue and droll repartee among the actors. But don't despair, action-movie fans! It's not ALL crackling dialogue! In fact, there's NO crackling dialogue! It is, however, quite droll, albeit unintentionally.Fans of action will be delighted to learn that Noah turns out to be a killing machine, personally murdering many people attempting to board his boat without a personal invitation from God. Noah is quite certain that they are uninvited because HE has a ""special"" relationship with God, and they DON'T! Take that, infidels!The adorable rock monsters get in on the act too, killing hundreds before dying valiantly, only to have their souls whisked off to some place in the sky, presumably rock-monster-heaven. While adrift at sea, Noah vows to kill the newly-born twin daughters of his step daughter (Ila, played with admirable diction by Emma Watson), sired by her step-brother Shem (Douglas Booth; the ethics of this incestuous pair-bonding are not questioned, owing perhaps to the propensity for such behaviour in the Bible). Why? Because Noah is a misogynistic crazy man, and has come to believe that God wants ALL of mankind to perish, for no particular reason other than the fact that Noah has turned into quite a sourpuss. If the infants had been boys, they would have been allowed to live out their lives by Noah, but since they are girls, they must be murdered, and Noah is just the man for the job!The other members of Noah's family, nonplussed by his promise to slay his newborn grand-daughters, to say nothing of his fanatical zealotry and poor attention to personal hygiene, build a raft for Ila, Shem, and their twin daughters in order to facilitate their escape from this opprobrium. Noah learns of this plan and burns the raft, using quick-burning fire-starting magic rocks that God has apparently sent his way. Well, at this point in the scripting of the film, perhaps some brave member of the film's ""creative"" team said something like, ""yeah Bringing in the rock monsters from The Hobbit was a BRILLIANT idea, Mr. Aronofsky, as was giving Noah totally SICK martial arts skills — kids just LOVE that stuff! — but having him murder his twin grand-daughters might not play so well in some places. Just sayin'!"" Whatever the reason, we suddenly see a change of heart in Noah, who bails on his murderous vow and allows the newborns to live. For now.What a great guy he is turning out to be! There is more after this, but there should not have been, because really, the entire film is a waste of time.-------Numerous ethical dilemmas are explored in this film that go far beyond the issue of incest, such as: How many people is it okay to kill if they are trying to get on your boat?  Should a man's family do whatever crazy stuff he orders just because he believes ""God"" is telling him to do crazy stuff? What if he's wrong, and nobody has any straight-jackets?  Who is this ""God"" character who (a) creates the world, (b) creates man and beasts, (c) becomes incensed with man, but not the beasts, but decides to kill practically all living things and start over? How exactly does God pick a crazy, abusive dude like Noah and his terrorized family to save? Could he not have picked a non-crazy dude? or more than one family? and (d) is powerful enough to create the world, life, and floods, but must rely on a crazy, misogynistic zealot to do his bidding for him when it comes to saving man and beasts?But the biggest questions we are left with after enduring this film are: How is it possible to make such a terrible film when you have a talented director, some talented actors, and 125 million dollars to spend?  Did no one read the script? Is the director, Darren Aronofsky, surrounded only by timid sycophants who do not challenge him?  Has Aronofsky lost any ability he ever had to be self-critical?Oof! What a spectacular turkey!",Noah
608,dmisnn,This was really bad.,3,6 July 2014,I watched this movie yesterday with my girlfriend. And we both did not like it one bit. We're not Christians but this is almost swearing. There is no respect for the bible story and it's everything but a film-presentation of the story. The characters are weak and uninteresting. The trailer clearly promised something else. We would say if you watch it be careful not to spend money on it. It is not worth it at all. Even the CGI isn't that great. It truly is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I will never watch it again. Let's hope there will not be a sequel. LOL. I hope this was helpful. Solong and thanks for all the fish. Greetings.,Noah
609,silentbogo-1337,Yawn....,1,10 August 2014,"This is the first movie that made me question the reliability of IMDb ratings. Usually if something has a rating of over 7.5 - it is good. 6 or above - it is mediocre, but still watchable.With this movie I've missed my expectations by thousand miles!It is boring right off the start. The plot is completely broken and inconsistent, regardless of whether it is based on Biblical story or is purely fictional creation. Things start to happen with no reason and no explanations at all. Sloppy action scenes are unable to compensate for ""formal"" presence of story line.Acting is horrible. Russel Crowe should definitely retire after this one. Anthony Hopkins?.. While movie trailers falsely promised cool special effects mixed with mystery and drama, all we get is another ""10,000 BC"".Bottom line: this movie does not deserve your attention. Even less so - your money or positive feedback.",Noah
610,andre-bobrov,Nothing to do with the truth.,7,31 March 2014,"First of all I was waiting for this movie from last year. But what I can say is that this is not biblical movie at all. There are few interesting facts that you should now before watching this.1. Movie states: in the beginning there was nothing. Bible states: in the beginning there was God. Who gonna argue who is right? God or director? I let it up to you. It seems director decided to create his own religion because he was not reading the book.2. Movie states: fallen angels (demons) fall because they wanted to help people. Bible: fallen angels fall because they denied word of God and followed Satan to become ""as gods"" with him. They also decided to destroy humanity because they hate human.3. Movie states: during creation light was created for light. Bible: light and earth was created for man. God did not created this earth for himself. He is a Father, we are kids.4. Movie states: man is a plague on earth. Bible: whole word and all seas, oceans, mountains and colors of rainbow were created for and only for a human.5. Movie states: God decided to kill all humanity. Bible: Humanity were punished for sins, but only sinners were punished.6. Movie states: Noah wanted to kill innocent baby. He is possessed by hate. Bible: Kids of Noah and their wives were on boat. He was very honest and good man. No other man wanted to join their arch however because they lived the life they wanted.7. Movie states: The king of people did satanic ritual during the movie and ate lizard head to ""heal"" himself. This what devil possessed people does. Bible: there were no other people on arch, only Noah and his big family.",Noah
611,nithinmmukundan,Slow and dark doesn't make a classic!,4,3 April 2014,"Being an agnostic, this was on of the most anticipated movie of the year for me. It seems Darren Aronofsky had to work with one line of script and dragged it forever...! Typical Hollywood cliché...! Come on, making a movie slow and dark doesn't make it a classic movie...!I'm not sure if this was the original story in the Bible but a lot of it doesn't make any sense...! I believe the glimpse of Big Bang theory and Evolution was put in to please the non-religious but it ended up contradicting the whole plot. The result was that the movie did not fit any class of viewers. I had this feeling that the original fantasy plot of the Noah's biblical story was going to let the movie down but it was the execution and direction that did the trick.The fact is, the movie fails as a fantasy movie as well as a biblical/religious movie. The last hour was too slow that I was wishing the ark would sink and everyone dies. If I had a dollar for every minute between dialogues, I would have become very very rich. Well it looks as if Evan Almighty was way better...!",Noah

Who even thinks of and makes such crap? The Noah portrayed here is not a righteous man, but a mad man.This movie is a clear sign of our times. It shows that God is harsh an evil and hates mankind, while the fallen evil beings are good and love mankind. That's the lie Satan wants everyone to believe, so he can eventually rule the world.Call what good is evil and what evil is good, just as the Bible predicts man will do in the end of times and this movie perfectly does that. Turning the righteous into evil madman and those who are evil into good persons and beings.The sad thing is that people will believe this is how it all happened while this movie could not be further from the truth then it is.",Noah

They are shocked..SHOCKED I tell you that Noah is portrayed as a hardcore fanatic willing to kill children for God. Well Christians..what about Abraham? You know the ""father of your faith""? God told him to kill his son and he was totally down for that...got the knife out and everything. In sermons this is seen as a shining example of faith that one should have should they hear voices in their head. What do you expect a prophet to be like? Remember Elijah? Called bears out of the woods to maul some young boys because they were taunting him. And they are shocked...SHOCKED that Noah is betrayed as drunk and naked...read the freakin' bible..he gets drunk and naked! Yes the bible is filled with lunatic prophets, drunkeness, sex and violence. People complaining about this movie have you even read the book of Genesis?I could go on here but I won't..Just wanted to share that I thought this was an excellent film overall..the acting was superb..he did make some interesting writing/directing choices some of which did not work. The rock creatures were cool but didn't seem to quite fit in. And I was hoping for more animal scenes and flood scenes. Also viewers should be aware that this the story is also based on the book of Enoch (an ancient book that did not make it into the biblical canon). This is where the angels and such come from. Overall I'd give it a 9 (but voted it a 10 to bring score up from the knuckleheads giving this a one. Good work Darren...the greatest living filmmaker in my opinion.",Noah

615,sarahyim,Sci-Fi Meets the Bible?,7,27 March 2014,"Noah (2014) fell short of expectations, even though groundbreaking work wasn't anticipated. Overall, it felt doable while messy and foreign. There's a lot to acclaim but also a lot to criticize.To start off, people who have no interest in the bible whatsoever should not watch this film; it will feel long and slow. (It does not need to be said that those with an aversion to the bible should not expect to enjoy this film either.) Noah is a movie that challenges people to visualize and personalize the Noah's Ark story - attach imagery, faces, human emotions, and internal strife to the hackneyed story.The cinematography/editing tried to be masterful but sometimes came off as awkward or too flashy. The motivic Cain/Abel snippet was chilling and artistically agreeable. On the other hand, the continual fast-forwarding technique used to illustrate progression was too much and too many. Thankfully, quality CGI alleviated some of the pain.The acting as an ensemble was slightly disappointing. Russell Crowe as the title character was notable. However, it didn't look like other actors had much to work with. Jennifer Connelly had a chance to shine and tried, but didn't quite get there. Her performance tended to confuse the viewer instead of diversifying the experience or elaborating on the situation. She moved furiously about the acting intensity scale, underacting in parts and overacting in others.Noah served an interesting purpose and offered a mediocre film experience. It is a messy, confusing mix of skillful and injudicious. Simply put, it's an acceptable flick that tries.",Noah
616,sie_francis82,"Terrible, terrible movie. Bad Aronofsky, bad! Naughty boy! Back in your box!!",1,3 August 2014,"What on Earth have I just watched? Darren Aronofsky is no stranger to the weird and wonderful, you just have to look at Black Swan (2010) to know that the director has vision, if not questionable mental health issues, but after watching this catastrophic disaster then I fear he may have finally lost it.Paramount were worried how this film would test with Christian audiences but I'm not sure that is the problem here. Even as an Atheist I am more offended at the fact that Aronofsky had taken a beloved story from the Bible and turned it into an appalling, fictitious account to exercise his own colossal ego. I mean, what were those rock people actually supposed to be? I don't remember those from the story. The thing Aronofsky should have realised is that there was no room for ""artistic"" license especially when the outcome was as poor as that. You are not Peter Jackson, so don't try to be.I almost feel bad for the actors who by all standards are of a high quality and their performances, as confined to the terrible script as they were, appeared to make what they could of it. In saying that, I dare say this could be a career killer for them. Let's hope I am wrong.The person I feel the most sorry for is myself. Not because I had to sit through that trot but because I paid £5.49 for it on Sky. Terrible, terrible movie. Bad Aronofsky, bad! Naughty boy!

617,justimagine93,Horrible,1,31 March 2014,"When you go to the movies to expect a cool adaptation of the world's most common Bible story, you expect I guess a Passion of the Christ (version of the story of Jesus's crucifixion), although don't even expect that---unless you are a fan of giant rock monsters (angels) building the ark (or long box boat) with a deranged Noah. At first you are like (okay okay so they are giving a dramatic interpretation I will let this slide) this attitude I kept up until the following things occurred: A) A psychopathic Noah is ""God?"" inspired to protect God's creation from man (translation: he is willing to kill anyone (anyone includes the people on the ark--yes his family) who gives mankind a surviving chance after the flood. The movie does TRY to touch on God's mercy, but God's mercy is not even a thing to notice when the characters are either crying out to God to listen to them or talking about being forsaken. B) Darren Aronofsky forsakes basic biblical information such as all of Noah's sons having wives, but Aronofsky gives only one of Noah's sons a wife, while the rest don't have time to ""fetch"" some before the flood strikes, which abandoned another aspect that this movie was trying to put across before contradicting that too: God will provide.

Great actors, great story, great genre, and the availability of modern day filming techniques. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver in any of those areas.It felt like the movie never really got started. I mean, a lot of stuff happened, but much of it felt random. The story was never very gripping and the movie never developed that epic feel that it seemed to promise. One might say that that is because we are all so familiar with the details that all the action was anticipated. And that would be a fair counter-argument, except no one was familiar with THIS version. Artistic license is acceptable in movie adaptations, but this Noah strayed so far from the well-known tale that it was almost unrecognizable. If it had been called ""Zedna"" and was placed on an alien world or in a fantasy realm where something happened that paralleled our Noah story (not an uncommon device), then it would have been much easier to swallow.

Lose the budget please, and those crappy digital effects that resemble student projects in Maya. PI (First feature film by Aronofsky) was a masterpiece - at $60.000 budget. Look at what money does to talent... oh my, it's a sure bet each and every time. This film was surely a huge FLOOD. Gladiator that protects flowers but slays men; Rocky crappy digitized monsters with deep and serious voices to portray fallen angels; some thousand species marching towards the arc without ONE SINGLE CLEAR shot at them - they just seemed to be a swarm of 'something', or replicas of clay, crawling towards the arc. At some point you can distinguish something that resembled an Elephant...equivalent to the one that comes up if you type ""Elephant 3D Maya tutorial"" in YouTube. Remember the Fountain, The wrestler, Black Swan and so on? Great films right?. OK, then you want to already forget this one. Don't mix up the previous filmography with Noah - the film is a disappointment to both the original story and to the great actors involved in it. Oh, yes, the actors. Was there any good acting involved? Hmm... let me put it this way: I think the actors where told they where making the planet of the Apes 4 right after being attacked by rocky transformers (they were obviously going to add the Apes digitally at post production). Then there was an apocalypse... it was not planet of the Apes, it was Noah. Did it make a difference? Nope.If they kept the actors in the desert, portrayed no arc, showed no digital rocky monsters, no armies, no flood, but had them talk between themselves and to themselves - then perhaps, Aronofksy could stand up to the name he has built so far. But money, like sugar is always a sweet temptation - one that adds a certain weight around you and inside you. This burden of a flooded title.. never leaves a directors mind.Clint Mansell, such a great music maker, what on earth was this? Did you just use your signature on the contract for this soundtrack? Even if you where inside an ark and everything was sinking around you you couldn't tolerate such Hollywood-ed flat, noisy, boring music. Come on! Everyone is watching TV series those days. Standards are way to low. It's similar to supermarkets and fast food. Quality does not matter, only quantity. Our brains absorb any type of junk thrown into our consciousnesses. This perhaps marks an era similar to the one portrayed in the film. The decline of Hollywood. I presume each one of us must build his own arc, an arc of consciousness and protect whatever is precious to oneself. One must not lose ones identity and essence inside this flooded society of ours. One must preserve the quality of the thing that makes us great living beings (not just human beings).",Noah

The first half of this movie builds up to the tension of whether Noah will live or die and construct the ark before the flood comes and then the scene is shown and then the tension melts away. That should have been the ending and I wanted it to be the end. A nice, tidy little ending, they show up on land forty days later and it ends. Instead I am treated to a cheesy, melodramatic plot in the second half of the movie. Then, mercifully the movie ends 45 minutes too long.Want me to give you one final reason you shouldn't watch this movie? The main character Noah, is nothing like in the bible.

As a man who does not believe in God or religion, I've always found mythology a very interesting aspect of ancient cultures, and this film tells one short but important tale in the book of Christianity in a credible and coherent way.The story unfolds quite calmly but it will always keep you watching. Some elements that were added are weird but some others even feel like they belong to the original story, there's many emotional moments and, of course, action sequences. The climax scene, however, could have been a bit longer since all of what is shown in the trailer about the flood, is what is seen in the movie, sadly.Still, a very good movie that anyone, believer or not, should watch.",Noah
625,npham54-754-347632,What a huge disappointment,5,3 April 2014,"I had some really high hopes for this film when I first saw the trailer on TV. It seems like there were going to be some type of huge ""Gladiator"" battles throughout the whole movie before the big flood. Of course everyone and their mother must have at least expected that to happen, even if you're an atheist. Here is the very short list of things I liked about this movie:1. Cinematography is great and should be for a big budget film. The scenes are beautiful and the locations were a good choice considering this version of ""Noah"".2. The acting was pretty good by pretty much all the main characters and Russell Crowe actually made me believe that Noah really could've been psycho in a former life.3. This last one is a real stretch here to even fill this spot, but drum roll please...The hilarity at the part where this movie crosses over with a LOTR feel! I mean it was like they ripped off LOTR and made the Ents (the live tree creatures) and made them out of stones instead. LoLNoah fails pretty much on all levels other than what was stated above. I love how the fact that the producers tried REALLY hard to mask the fact that the original story came from the BIBLE and tried REALLY hard to cater to people from all religious backgrounds. I mean come on man, ""The Creator""? Seriously?!?!?!?!?!?!???? I'm no bible thumper but let's just call it what it really is. This is a story about Noah trying to obey God and what he believes what God wants Noah to do. Trying to get away from the whole ""Christian/Catholic"" idea is dumb. I doubt that the audience would've hated the idea. I'm sure they would've went to watch it anyway but most likely laughed at the fact of how hard they tried not to make it directly pointed at any one religion. I sure as hell did. It's funny how the synopsis on here states in the absolute first line about Noah trying to obey ""God"". I believe they should really change that to what ""God"" was actually called during the whole entire film. There was never any mention of the word ""God"" anywhere.If it wasn't for the scenes and the good job of acting, I most likely would've rated this movie a 2, 3 at best. I can't believe I missed watching Sabotage over this. But then again it wasn't my choice, it was someone else's idea in our party to watch this instead. What a bad choice.",Noah

The film has a couple of plot holes, but what can you expect from an historical event made into a film. it also has some graphic scenes that might make you sick, so prepare for those moments. The film also is to long with a 2+ hour run time and sometimes the acting is mediocre at best (not terrible but not great either).Give Noah a try for yourself and then judge but don't read up on negative reviews saying how terrible it is because remember we go to movies to be entertained and this movie serves justice to that. sure with numerous plot holes and why is this and why is that questions going through your head throughout the film, Noah is a movie not to miss this month! so go to the movies with a friend or family member and enjoy yourselves this weekend!.",Noah
627,nativeapache,Disingenuous movie by Mr. Aronofsky,1,29 March 2014,"I knew going into this movie that there was going to be some definite inaccuracies in the story as based in the Genesis story.I thought the save the animals/planet message was actually going to be stronger, being since that is what all the controversy has been about. So I was somewhat pleasantly surprised that it didn't come out as strong as I thought in the movie.My biggest complaints were the added plot lines that Mr. Aronofsky invented in this Biblical story. For example, there is a person on the ark that clearly is not supposed to be there according to scripture, and there were some people who weren't on the ark that are supposed to be there. We also got some weird like rock giants who I guess are supposed to be the Sons of God or the nephilim, whatever they are I don't think they were rock transformers. There are some other inaccuracies but these bothered me the most.I've always loved the Noah story more or less for the unknowns of the story, like how did they build the ark, how did the earth actually flood, how did they get the animals to behave while in the ark, and how advanced technologically was the pre-flood culture. We get glimpses of of this pre-flood life but more so we get rock giants, some mysticism, and a vegan Noah.Overall, visually speaking, this movie wasn't that bad but if you've read the story in Genesis you will certainly be disappointed if not out right offended by some of the liberties taken in this movie. I'm rating this movie as disingenuous.",Noah
628,david-alkhed,A flawed yet entertaining Biblical epic,7,7 June 2017,"I was really not sure what to expect from Noah going into it. I knew that the reception for it was, polarizing at best, I had never seen any Darren Aronofsky movie so I was not familiar with his style or camera tricks, and I was unsure if the film would move me on an emotional level. And, I found myself entertained by it.First things first, the acting. I think Russell Crowe delivered a very strong performance as Noah, he really sold me as both a father, and as God's chosen man to build the ark. It's probably not an easy role to play, but I think Russell Crowe managed pretty well. Jennifer Connelly was very good as Naoh's wife Naameh. Anthony Hopkins was basically playing Anthony Hopkins, so, I really don't have anything more to add there. Ray Winstone does a very good job as a scenery-chewing villain who I thought was pretty entertaining. He wasn't 100% believable, but to be fair when you have a movie where a guy builds a floating zoo for every animal in the world with his family to survive a giant rainstorm, I think that's acceptable. The younger actors are more problematic, however. I thought Logan Lerman was pretty flat, though to be fair I don't think he had that much to work with, Douglas Booth was sometimes a little over-the-top, and Emma Watson was fine. She wasn't spectacular, but she did okay with the material.Another element which I liked was the pre-flood landscape. The film was shot in Iceland, and Darren Aronofsky used some really interesting locations that I haven't really seen much before. It was very smart by Aronofsky to use more fantasy-like landscapes instead of iconic contemporary locations in order to sell the world. That element is very well handled.Speaking of the world-building, I think Aronofsky did a good job of portraying why humanity is so corrupt and violent, which is very important because his job is to sell to me that humanity is at such a bad state that God is willing to kill everyone except six or eight people. And I thought it was handled very well.The biggest problem for me was honestly the visual effects. I didn't think they looked very good, to be perfectly honest. I mean, they're fine on their own, but I think in order to sell the movie you need some truly breathtaking visual effects, and that was simply not the case. Some of the stuff with the rock monsters looked like stop-motion, and some of the stuff with the animals were pretty unconvincing.I should probably dress the religious controversies surrounding the film. Paramount tested three different versions of Noah to different religious groups, without Aronofsky's involvement or knowledge, all three of which to negative reviews. Then, Paramount decided ""screw it, were just gonna release Darren's cut of the movie"", and that is the version that was released. And there was a lot of controversy surrounding the film's accuracy to the bible which turned some people off. Now I am not a religious person, I'm an atheist in fact, I haven't read the Bible and certainly not the stuff about Noah, so perhaps with all that going in, I didn't mind the liberties Aronofsky and screenwriter Ari Handel took with the source material. If the film was 100% faithful to the bible, it would probably be a very boring film, and I do think Aronofsky tried to be as faithful as they possibly could while at the same time trying to make an entertaining adventure movie, I mean this is a $130 million movie after all. And Aronofsky's responsibilities as a filmmaker is primarily to entertain, but also make a movie that's interesting to make it accessible to non-religious people, like me.So overall, You could say it's a mixed review, I liked Crowe's Connelly's and Winstone's performances, I liked the design of the world and use of locations, I disliked the performances of some the younger actors, some of the visual effects were unconvincing and fake-looking.My final score, 7/10.",Noah
629,gordonlukas62,"Noah is ambitious, odd, and ultimately a mess",5,24 April 2015,"Not much can really be said about Noah except that it's a half good film with another half that's absolutely rubbish. This isn't a spoiler, but there are six armed giants made out of rock that participate in a battle scene a quarter of a way through the movie that are just ridiculous. It takes away any credibility in character and plot, ruining the first half. The second half, while strange, makes good use of Noah as a complex, and unhinged character. It's unfortunate that the movie then leaves a bad taste in your mouth because of the first half. Strange, interesting, and ultimately not that rewarding, Noah is worth watching if you really have to see it, but if you're just curious, it's a skip. Still not as bad as The Fountain.",Noah
630,dtaylorii,"A Fantasy Tale of Magic, Wizardry which Misappropriates Biblical Names and History",1,10 April 2014,"I just saw this. Initially I was looking forward to it, but then I read the almost universally awful reviews by normal people. I decided to go anyway. I understand, now.It's a pure fantasy tale which has had the extremely bad taste to use Biblical names and history, then interweave mystical/magical and definitely anti-historical material.In the beginning, there was NOTHING?? Semi-divine rock monster fallen angels?? Noah feeling driven to infanticide of his own grandchildren?? Magic fire crystals? Methuselah makes Shem's girlfriend fertile? The land a modern-style eco disaster, barren of food and plants due to technology and mankind run rampant, so a forest has to spring up from a magical seed in moments so the ark can be built? Noah's sons are wifeless? (Although this bit of un-history allows the director's contrivance of Noah imagining his creator wants his family to die out as his boys are young, therefore wifeless, and there will be no more available females to father children with, so he can later defy and fail in the infanticide he has imagined his creator desires of him.) Jubal Cain a stowaway on the ark??What a disturbing load of crap. Disturbing as many folks will imagine this is a real depiction of Noah as reported in the Bible, and only a few elements scattered through the crap are accurately pulled from the history.I wouldn't object so strongly had this film left out the Biblical names and situations, and merely constructed something purely of fantasy. Why do what was done? To confuse and obfuscate--a shameful role for our entertainment industry to take. Shame on Aronofsky for purveying it, and on Russell Crowe for participating in it!",Noah
631,hdsink,Spoiler - Not at all Biblically correct; read at own risk,1,16 May 2015,"This movie is the worst depiction of God's promise, and Noah and his family. Granted we don't know if Methuselah really died in the flood or not, but we do know that he did die during the same year of the flood.The Bible clearly states that all three sons were married before they were ever on the ark. It does not mention of them having children while on the ark.Also to the person who made the comment about the elephants lying on their sides - If God can speak through a donkey, have a great fish swallow Jonah and live three days in it, He can also keep all those animals healthy while they slept. Again, Noah and his family had enough food on the ark for them and the animals.Their lives were never in danger for Noah was a righteous man in God's eyes.The lies told in the movie about fallen angels helping Noah make non-believers think that this is in the bible because they don't care to read it. Nobody had it in for Noah, and he was proud of his children.It saddens me that movie makers don't even try to get the story accurate. They will be judged in the end with the rest of us.",Noah

Its quite obvious from the start that its not a literal interpretation of the Bible story so thats got the Hard line Christians annoyed already and despite stopping short of showing the evolution of Ape in to Man in one scene, its quite clear that the makers of this film are doing their own thing with it and they don't give a damn who they might upset. And good for them. The story is excellent and it felt familiar and alien at the same time, a bit like when I saw Lord of the Rings 20 years after reading the book, You know its not sticking to the script but that doesn't hurt it at all.The Environmental aspect of the film is obvious and the Vegetarian/Vegan overtones have been well documented in the main stream media but its not shoved down your throat yet you still come away feeling that you should be doing more for the planet as the message behind the Movie is quite powerful...Change or die.The acting...My only grumble would be Emma Watsons portrayal of a Mother when I still think of her as a 10 year old wizard. Crowe is well suited to the part and pulls off the Wise, God fearing honourable Noah and The rest of the cast are more than adequate to the role given them.Was it a bit too long?, not for me, it kept me rooted to the chair for the 2hr and 17 minutes and I was a bit sad when it finished as it was quite a good yarn.Don't watch this film if you are a Biblical Literalist, you wont like it and you'll get upset so spare yourself the offence, everyone else should though....",Noah
634,erichansen1836,DEMOCRATS (side of Noah) vs. REPUBLICANS (side of Cain),10,24 January 2016,"This film NOAH (2014, Russell Crowe as NOAH) fits in well with the message the Creator has given me to preach which is that evil (IN ITS ENTIRETY) must be purged from the face of the earth. It was the case in NOAH's day with the line-of-Cain, and it was the case in the time of the near annihilation of the Tribe of Benjamin (Judges chp 19-21). Because the evil, sexually perverted and rape/murderous Benjamin tribe was allowed by the Judah tribe (line of David and Jesus) to not become extinct (extinguished from the face of the earth) but allowed to perpetuate itself from a 600 man remnant remaining alive after a violent war with Judah where 65,000 men from Judah and Benjamin died (and 1000's of women and children and animals mentioned, but not in the numbers killed), these 600 evil men remaining from Benjamin kidnapped virgin wives and from this line came the likes of the evil King Saul and Saul of Tarsus (aka Paul). Paul kidnapped the WAY from Jesus' followers and made his own religion called Christianity which is a cult (a mixture of truth and falsehood i.e. yeast). Jesus warned about Paul many times (although not by name). Jesus warned of wolves in sheep's clothing (Benjamin tribe is the wolf tribe) coming into the flock. Jesus warned of the yeast (false teaching) of the Pharisees (Paul was both a Benjamite and a Pharisee). King Tubal-cain preached a good believable sermon to Ham regarding Ham's so-called God-given right to seize the earth and all it contains and take dominion of it and subdue it. Ham almost fell for the lie. It is no wonder that so many have fallen for the message of the pseudo-apostle Paul. Paul did not meet any of the conditions for Apostleship as mentioned in ACTS chapter 1. But people for some reason still buy into the idea of Paul's story of seeing Jesus on the road to Damascus even though Jesus was gone to heaven to stay by ACTS 1:11 as testified to by the angels of God. As Bishop T D JAKES has said, ""All that glitters is not gold"" i.e. everything you read in the Bible is not truth (although factual) e.g. Paul's message and story. TRUTH and FACT are two different things. Jesus knew that when the Devil tempted him to jump to test if the angels would catch him. I think REPUBLICANS need to take a hard look at what they believe in. The film NOAH makes it clear that the DEMOCRATIC PARTY ideas of responsible stewardship of the earth and its animals and people and natural resources are God's idea, and that the REPUBLICAN PARTY ideas of exploitation of the earth (what Cain's line followed) is the exact opposite of God's plan. Are we our Brother's Keeper? Yes. Cain defied God by implying that Cain (himself) was not the Keeper of his Brother Abel. God does expect us to look after the needs of others as well as our own. That is what the DEMOCRATIC ideology does. However, one thing I noticed odd was that the writers of this epic film appear to make NOAH and his family noticeably negligent about looking after their grandfather Methusala who spends most of his days alone sleeping in a cave up in a mountainside away from family. NOAH and his family rarely visit him nor think to bring him anything when they do come. Methusala is not even invited on the ARK and ends up dying overcome by the flood waters. Strange. Perhaps the writers are making a statement against DEMOCRATS or society in general that we are not sufficiently looking after the needs of our elderly and in most cases shun them to live the rest of their lives in isolation and lack.",Noah

The first 8 mins is like staring into the sun, it is that bad that you have to turn away. The movie doesn't redeem itself after this and I am sure that I will never be able to swallow the full 2 hours of American junk food that is this garbage.

636,agentbinky-74-891144,Better off watching The Fountain again,6,18 August 2014,"I watched this movie with Fordcozen and Weaponode while the latter was in town over the weekend, and it's pure hogwash from a Biblical perspective, as one would expect from Darren Arenofsky. After man eats the Forbidden Fruit in the Garden of Eden, the movie purports to state, angels disobeyed the Creator to help mankind make his way in the world. They fell to Earth, and their bodies of light got stuck in the dirt and mud of the Earth's crust, forming them into weird, asymmetrical rock monster things. Then Cain murdered Abel, and left the company of Adam and his family to found the evil Nations of the World, built on strife, rape, and mayhem. These nations waged war with Adam's clan and the rock monsters, and generally despoiled the planet. This is the back story provided in the first fifteen minutes of the movie.Anyhow, Noah sees a vision of a great rainstorm that floods the earth, and he goes to visit his grandfather, Methuselah (excellently played by Anthony Hopkins), for confirmation. Methusaleh tells him that indeed, he must build an ark to save the worlds' land-based species, and gives him a seed from the Garden of Eden. Once planted, it transforms the despoiled land into a verdant forest, from which the wood for the ark can be gathered. It is only then, with this miraculous display, that the distrustful rock monsters agree to help Noah build the Ark. The special effects where the animals all stampede into the ark are quite impressive.Tubal-cain, the King of the evil world's armies, gets wind of all this and prepares to launch a massive attack on the location of the ark, intending to claim it for himself. There's a good speech here about how man should not be beholden to miracles, but should claim his future for himself with his own will. Kind of struck a chord in my agnostic heart. There's a giant, visually spectacular battle between the rock monsters and Tubal-cain's armies just as the Flood begins, and eventually Tubal-cain is the only one to survive. He climbs onto the ark via a secret side entrance.This is turning into a rote description of the film's plot, which was not my intention. I won't spoil the rest of the film for you, but suffice it to say that strife continues with the survivors on the Ark, and there are plenty of opportunities for Russell Crowe (as Noah) and especially Jennifer Connelly (as Naameh, Noah's wife) to show off their acting chops. The film grasps for the poignancy reached in Aronofsky's film ""The Fountain,"" as Noah narrates the creation story as scenes of evolution from single cells through fish through amphibians through mammals through primates are shown. I thought the best part of the film was when Noah talks about the violence inherent in man since the Fall as the victims of thousands of murders similar to Abel's flash in rapid succession on the screen. It really struck a chord with me.All this is not enough to save the movie from its overall mediocrity, however. If you want a study of human mysticism and purpose, with an Aronofsky bent, you would do far better to just rent ""The Fountain"" and watch it. It's a much more brilliant movie that actually brought tears to my eyes the first time I watched it. I'd have to say that ""Noah"" suffers from a rather clunky plot, a third Genesis, a third Book of Enoch, and a third Aronofsky's own invention, and as a whole it doesn't really work. I liked the film, but I have to give it a VERY hesitant ""thumbs up,"" and a rating of three stars out of five.",Noah
637,teoalcantara,A True Epic of Biblical Proportions!,10,3 April 2014,"Christian or Atheist, faithful to what is depicted on the Bible or not...This is a MUST SEE movie. Not due to religion, but simply because it is all that a great movie needs to be:It's entertaining, moving, thrilling and passes on good values without being overly 'preachy' (while also providing food for thought).Now, I am NOT a Christian, nor do I consider myself a religious guy.I DO however believe in Christian values, such as love for one another, respect for family, nature and all living things.And I think movies such as this are sorely missed nowadays. I've read some reviews here and was baffled by so many negative ones. I can only think they come from some religious groups that thought the film was not 'faithful' enough or preachy enough or whatever. Some complained about the pace (?!). The film has more than two hours and I didn't look at my watch once! Come on, people! Some compared it to Transformers... Huh???? Thank GOD (pun intended) I don't go by bad reviews! Or else I'd miss one of the best movies I saw in recent times (and yes, I do see a lot of movies, be art house ones or pop-corn blockbusters - I can appreciate both, IF they are THIS good.The ONLY flaws I found in this film are technical. The CGI creatures (apart from the stone ones) are terrible! The snake, the weird looking fox with scales at the beginning, the 2 doves in flight are really, really bad... SyFy Channel level bad. But the rest (actors, script, music etc) is so good, that more than compensates for! Go. Watch it. You can thank me later!",Noah
638,marinella-mermaid,Not watertight,5,30 April 2014,"I've just seen Noah, wanted to check other reviews and was a bit shocked by the negative response - even if I overheard a woman at the cinema say it was the worst film she'd ever seen after Oblivion.Yes, it's a bit of a mess, but it also has some very interesting stuff in it, especially some of the rapid edit storytelling device, and yes, the rock creatures/ angels. I don't really care if it differs from the Bible and those complaining only had to watch Aronofsky's previous work to get a reality check. I'll just make a list instead of a review: The Good: Most of the acting was solid, especially Jennifer Connelly. Russell Crowe did a good job with such a complex portrayal of Noah - I think he lacked a bit of direction with the arc maybe (arc, not ark). Rock creatures/ angels. The concept art was probably pretty cool as well. The Bad: Sorry but after Avatar you can no longer get away with crap CGI, which this had lots of. The snake/ apple/ Eden bit was similar to the first video game on my first iBook, back in 2000. Everything looked CGI, they could in fact have CGI'd Anthony Hopkins in and the result would have been similar. How many hair pieces did Russell Crowe have? The last one looked like something Oprah Winfrey would wear. And Ray Winstone just seems to play the same role in every film. Plot holes: when exactly did Noah add an escape pod to the ark? It just magically appears. And why could the Cain descendants not build their own boat/ raft? No shortage of wood in that forest.Overall, it was entertaining, probably worth seeing, but a bloated confection.",Noah
639,nerklus,"Noah - ah, no. Avoid - meh cubed.",4,18 July 2014,"Annoying, stupid and filled with unnecessary ... everything.Noah can possibly be enjoyed by those who either love CGI with no requirement for story line, those who enjoy talking out loud criticising appalling movies, or if you are stoned out of your everloving mind.Anthony Hopkins was enjoyable - but hardly worth enduring this dreck for. He play Methuselah who apparently was an awesome warrior and magician. (What were they thinking?) Russell Crowe speaks in the same monotonous, low voice throughout the entire film. Of course, here Noah is closer to his Gladiator character. Who knew that Noah was highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, easily over coming all adversaries. I generally like Russell Crowe, but he's atrocious here. In his defense, no one could have been good here, except maybe Jim Carrey if he milked it for laughs. Parody idea? Lots of spurious magic. Why just light a fire when you can throw a magic glowing, unexplained piece of something? Let's chuck in some imaginary fallen angels - the Watchers, so we can have some Transformer style CGI? Ooh, let's have more CGI and show all the animals arriving at the ark. Any more opportunities for CGI? Of course, this is the primary purpose of this nonsense. Let's have explosions and trippy sequences showing the biblical creation scenes and oh, so much more. Have no fear CGI fans - no money was wasted on the plot.So the plot sucked. The dialogue even more so. Continuity, logic, common sense, rationality are all MIA.The other actors (even Emma Watson) - spend most of their time shrieking, crying or otherwise getting on your nerves. It is hard to actually judge the actors too harshly for their acting - it would have been impossible to keep this train on the tracks. The train wreck was apparent very early on.Not that the biblical story of Noah can be taken literally, but to change it into a biblical, sci-fi, action fest defies any rational explanation other than someone thought it would make money.Actually, I can only recommend this movie to those who love CGI, love laughing at unintended humour and making sarcastic comments to their friends.

640,dreamer-17,"Racist or stupid? Darren Aronofsky, Ari Handel",1,5 August 2014,"What can I say about this horrible movie? Even if it is more like a sci-fi Mad-Max-Lord of the Rings storyline-it was boring, way too long, and filled with long heartbreaking and depressing scenes with way too much crying and over acting.Spoiler: Aside from that, since the point of Noah's ark was to repopulate the earth, either the sons or their wives should have been black, Asian, and fair/blond. Instead everyone looks about the same beige color with brown hair. Look at the pictures in the long line of credits here at IMDb and you will see everyone looks like the director, Darren Aronofsky. What does he have against anyone with different skin tone from him? Has he wondered where are the rich variety of human colors and genetic variations going to come from once the Ark has landed? I mean, I have read that some scientist wrote that blue eyes is a genetic mutation, but come on, this is the Ark, there should have been variation. Also, the son's of Cain--i.e. the whole civilization, were all white people too. Perhaps there were other colors of people in there, but I don't remember seeing them.Since the movie was written, directed, and produced by Darren Aronofsky, I guess there was no one in authority to slap him on the back of the head and say, ""No, no, no, that is lame."" I was looking forward to the animal scenes, but all it entailed was a mass migration from a long distance away, of totally fake CGI animals.I kind if think Darren Aronofsky would have had a better story if he actually opened the bible and read the few paragraphs about Noah and what the point of the flood and ark was.Fallen angels are demons with who want to destroy man. They are not Rock Creatures punished because they want to help mankind. Ask any child if a demon is a friend or an enemy.There were so many technical and biblical errors in the movie, which might have been OK if the story was interesting and if the acting was good. Crowe just phoned it in, using the same character he has used for his last few action movies.I can't believe I watched the movie to the end, I just kept hoping it would get better and redeem itself.

Clearly, the writer and director chose to turn a beautiful story into one that hardly resembled the true character of Noah. He clearly did not believe that Noah and his children could build the ark or was chosen to save the earth and made pure mockery of the story. I have no clue where he got the sci-fi looking Rock Ents (perhaps stolen from Lord of the Rings) to build and defend the ark; perhaps he did not believe in the story to begin with. The whole story was backwards, missing an important portion when Noah invited other righteous people to join him in the ark. Instead Noah, a chosen prophet, was depicted as a deranged drunk ready to kill babies, blindly following a hateful ""Creator"". Where did that come from?

I think that someone (director/writer) took the name and the ark and then rewrote the whole story. It certainly wasn't the Noah story I knew from Sunday School. Noah was really this very mean man not the godly man from Genesis. And maybe if they had used the word ""God"" instead of ""creator"" then I might have had more sympathy for Noah but as they couldn't offend anyone by using the ""G"" word I have no sympathy for them.

I am a fan of the director's prior works, most especially ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan"". It was not so much the camera angles, or direction per say that disappointed as it was the story.

Enter a curious band of refugees from Beyond Thunderdome led by the angry and entitled Ray Winstone and now you have conflict. Because the Man vs God/Environment is not conflict enough, apparently. The story takes an even more dramatic departure from it's source material from here on out. Unfortunately it jumps around from scene to scene and theme to theme too often for the next 60 minutes so that by the end when the sun is showering the Earth with enough radiation to create multiple dim rainbows you're just hoping the credits are soon to follow.

It's a great story although a very moving and sad story. That's the Bible review now for the film. What the heck was all that load of rubbish? Darren Aronofsky has made a complete mess of a great story. People have said that the film is blasphemous and I have to agree with them. (Yes I am a Christian.) However it's not just the blasphemy that I don't like about this film, it's BORING!! Aronofsky has created a world where lets be honest you'd want to destroy and I'm not just talking about the way the humans were acting. The landscape was so depressing at the beginning of the film. Noah is depressing and if I was the 'creator' I wouldn't want to save him neither. He's judgemental and so unloving it's unbelievable. At no point in the film did I feel for Crowe's character, he plays him so bad. However the thing that did it for me, the thing that completely ruined the film is the stupid, ridicules Rock Giants. What was the director thinking? Genesis does talk about the Nephilim, but nowhere does it say they were made of rock and they are not in the story of Noah. However even if they were, what the film makers have done is dreadful. People have said that they are like something from Transformers. I don't agree at all. Although they are created by CGI they look like a rubbish attempt by the late 'great' Ray Harryhausen. What Alonofski has made is a dreadful film that depicts the story of Noah as nothing more than fictional. He hasn't at anyway given any acknowledgement to the book of Genesis, and all he has shown is that he can make a film that can and does bore people to tears.

To complicate matters, you have differing versions of events and expectations based on what line of faith you follow as well. For example, Muslim vs Christianity.If you are not versed with the story of Noah, chances are you will go into this movie, with no expectations and think this is actually not as bad as some of you are rating it.Some of you suggested this is a bit stretched out and even a bit over melodramatic towards the end but heck, are you suggesting that you would have directed this stretching out more of the unnecessary acts of evil from the Tubal-Cain tribe of men which had already been masterly communicated by Aronfsky's directing? Each message was clear and artistically portrayed by Aronfsky. As a director, I think he needs to be applauded to take such a sensitive project like this one and actually coming out with results that do keep the audience engaged. I mean how exciting can this story be; a man who puts animals into a wooden ark and waiting for the oceans to fill the Earth. I can think of several other biblical stories that was better suited for entertainment purposes. I even thought the Watchers were a bit far fetched but Aronfsky's interpretation was just as rational as all the other versions I have studied.I think if you go into this movie with no expectations, park your belief and education about what the children bible stories were teaching you and just watch the movie as an interpretation of the biblical story, you will not come out disappointed.Kudos to Aronfsky, Crowe and Connelly for this well executed project. Credit goes to the Noah sibling cast for keeping up with the more experienced cast in this and I could almost taste the berry that Hopkins finally finds towards the end.I think its an achievement and will find a well deserved space in my Blu-Ray library collection when it is released.",Noah

There are long sequences where Noah is brooding or dreaming and no one is talking. Plus Noah himself is a miserable unlikeable character. The Anthony Hopkins character just pops in and out. The main baddie is a cartoony who you really don't care about. So you are watching this boring movie about Noah and ancient times, supposedly rooted in reality, then Tree Ents from Lord of the Rings show up in Rock Costumes and protect Noah and his family while they build the ark in the background. Finally the main baddie shows up with humanity to bum rush the Ark and the Rock monsters fight them off until the main baddie appears with a bazooka like device??? In 4000bc? The baddie ""shoots"" the rock monsters, then God brings them to heaven? What the heck is happening?Finally the earth is flooded , and the story focuses on the ark floating around. The inside of the ark looks like stage set piece of every dark interior you have seen in every movie. Noah thinks that God wants all of humanity dead, including he and his family, so he announces that he will kill any future female baby so that humanity will end with them. Of course, Shem's wife has 2 girls and more boring predictable drama ensues.Did I mention how bad the acting is? No one is believable. When Jennifer Connelly is crying, I was waiting for the director to yell ""cut"". You care about no one in this movie.The only sequence I actually liked was the watchers vs people rushing the ark. It was a cool action sequence lifted from LOTR 2 towers.Religious folks won't get anything from this, atheists will laugh at this, and the general movie goers will fall asleep.Avoid.",Noah
650,wbbartlett,A truly strange film,2,17 September 2014,I am not a bible nut so have no particular issue with the subject matter. The approach though was just zany and I just wondered quite what point the whole 'epic' was trying to make. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the appearance of the ents from Lord of the Rings (perhaps seeking useful employment post-Trilogy?). That might at least be worth one extra mark for originality. Probably not quite the worst movie I've seen (though I am to be honest struggling to think of a worse one). I am struggling also to think of any redeeming features. Acting to be honest is pretty wooden and uninspiring in most parts. Definitely won't be looking out for the DVD... Make up your own minds but I won't be watching again.,Noah
651,mc1966,Of no value at all,2,21 April 2014,"As widely suggested by other reviewers, the movie has nothing to do with the biblical story of Noah. As a fantasy movie, it leaves a lot to be desired. Basically, it appears as if an environmentalist scriptwriter had borrowed some ideas from the Bible and tried adding some of his own (quite underdeveloped) thoughts, basically leading to nowhere. The way the movie has been shot is also quite underwhelming. While CGI effects are nothing special, the final scenes really put you off, with pinkish and soft-tone colors and a solemn voice in the background. Finally, acting is pretty dull. It seems as if even the actors realized the lowliness of the movie and didn't try hard, basically repeating the run-of-the-mill expressions we have seen in their other films.",Noah

This movie actually has visually brought the Noah and the Ark story to life. However, with the inclusion of the ""angels"" included in the movie, I believe the movie tried to please the modern-day movie goer more than the Bible's version of Noah's story. Although I enjoyed the directors interpretation of Noah's story, the special effects and acting were fantastic. Noah (Russell Crowe was great as usual) and his wife Naameh ( Jennifer Connelly played her part exceedingly well.) This movie had me thinking about other stores in the Bible days after seeing Noah the movie.",Noah
653,alexis-skinner51,"Visually enthralling movie, Made Noah seem callous.",6,23 April 2014,"Amidst the past decade of religiously centered movies, ""Noah"" proved to be another controversial one in terms of content and accuracy. The expectations for the film were high, which was mostly due to the choice of the cast. The expectations were also high because it was a biblical film and the Christian community is always critical. This said, the perspective on the film could heavily depend on your religious standpoint. The plot was definitely interesting, and the visual effects could not be matched. Some of the characters seemed a bit underdeveloped but that could've been the director's choice to focus more on the main characters. At times, Russell Crowe as Noah seemed so overly intense and callous that the audience almost felt animosity towards him. The dramatic scenes were sometimes a bit overacted and took away from the movie. There were a few light parts with humor but for the most part it was a solemn film. Coming from a Christian standpoint, the film was definitely inaccurate and bothersome for those that knew the real story. So much so, that those in the midst of atheists felt almost mortified of the way the story was taking place. The movie was visually intriguing but the altering of the original story truly takes away from the intended message and account of Noah.",Noah
654,zamba50001,Not a religious movie!!!,8,13 April 2014,"I personally thought Noah was epic! It was based on what the bible said, but still had some interesting tones to it. People hate this movie because it was weird and dark! But the hole concept is weird, so you can't blame him for making it more realistic then what the bible say. The director Darren Aronofsky is known for making movies that are deep and dark, but it still couldn't be as dark as the fans maybe wanted it to be! The actors were extremely good!!! They make everything a lot more realistic! Russell Crowe shows us that Noah is having a hard time following god's orders. The movie had very good cinematography too! It shows you how dead the world was! The action was pretty good too! But the action wasn't so good that I would only think and focus on the action no! The dialog was also pretty intense and epic sometimes! The family are like"" Noah please! we know that you are serving god! But this is to much"" The movie was epic, interesting, had really good acting. The movie had a realistic tone of men. I think the movie is a 8/10",Noah
655,sketchboy123,God Awful Action Movie,1,24 August 2014,"Noah, the most bizarre and horrible Bible movie ever made. It has rock golems, gun powder, oracles, magic berries, and an action hero Noah kicking bad guy butt. This is the typical case of a project with too many chiefs and yes-men. It's hard to believe that no one, from the director all the way to the gaffer and best boy, didn't think they could have created a better story than this. Instead, everyone must have really trusted the whole Hollywood process to turn this crap into something likable. They must have been the same guys who told themselves to cast Russel Crowe in Le Miserables and maybe no one will notice that he can't carry a note. This film proves that there is a strong Hollywood element that looks down on the movie goers and thinks we are stupidly willing to love anything they release. Did they learn nothing from Water World or Krull? Were they planning to release action figures and Noah's Ark play-sets, because this movie has cookie cutter written all over it? Just because you have a CGI department, that doesn't mean you can use it to increase the speed of the movie assembly line. This movie is to Hollywood what the chicken nugget is to the fast food industry; quick fried junk for people that will put anything in their stomachs, regardless of quality. No stone goes unturned when Hollywood wants a good action movie. (Still more interesting than Man of Steel.)",Noah
656,windycitytoast,Noah,8,29 March 2014,"I have not seen the film yet, but this is comment is more of a caution to people who are looking for a good review of it. Heed many of the negative comments on IMDb. There has been a huge influx of people specifically hardcore christians. Who are creating accounts just to boycott and talk smack about the film without even seeing it. I for one think anyone is entitled to have there own interpretation of the story of Noah (Book Of Genesis/Quran) and this movie is simply Aronofsky's. Just like the Passion of the Christ came out, thousands of religious nutjobs went to the internet and either praised/bashed the film for its horrible portrayal. A huge difference between the two films, is that Noah will most likely be an honest piece of work rather than the Passion which was a film that was meant to please Gibson's own father rather than the audience. All I'm saying is that be careful what reviews you take notice of, and make sure its nobody who is against the film just because of its portrayal of events. From what I've heard so far, Aronofsky navigates the story from the bible preety faithfully onto the screen.",Noah

I mean, you already have a basic script available. Stick to it. What a waste of budget this movie has been. I don't want to know what budget we are looking at, but better things could have been done with it. The Noah, flood and ark story is good enough and crazy enough as it is, no need to screw it up or make major changes to it like that. What were you guys thinking?! Apart from major flaws in the plot, there are some very serious and cunning lies woven into the story, completely misrepresenting the Creator who the book is about. You even sneaked a bit of evolution and gap theory into it as well?! Seriously. What did you guys smoke? We are not stupid. Stop making films that insults our intelligence.I am waiting for the day that somebody makes a proper Noah movie where he actually takes two of every KIND as it is written, and there are also little dinosaurs on board. That will be controversial enough.Ah yes, lastly. The animation of the flying doves were horrible. Why did you skimp on that? Doves clap their wings a little, and then they glide a little, they don't clap frantically all the time like a duck that's about to be sucked into a jet turbine. Not that better animation would have rescued the movie.I am beginning to think that the movie was specifically intended to perpetuate lies, and it was the goal to be such a mess as it is.

658,ashi4782,Recommend for Teenagers and Young Adults. Older Generations Will Be Too Stubborn To Enjoy It.,8,1 August 2014,"Being a teenager, I have to say that this story really identified with me. I think younger people will really enjoy this movie because it does reaffirm many of the younger generation's beliefs. It also deals with coming of age and the loss of innocence. When growing up, we do struggle with morality in our transition to ""adulthood"". I also really loved the themes of legacy and trying to fix the mistakes of ancestors and the generations before you. Older generations will be more likely to hate this movie because older generations have their own concrete beliefs that have grown through decades, so anything that contradicts that is usually ignored (whether it is true or not). Stubbornness is not a virtue, and it should not be maintained throughout this movie.If you like any of the following movies, then you will probably like ""Noah"": ""Place Beyond the Pines"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""There Will Be Blood"", ""Romeo and Juliet (1968)"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Mr. Nobody"", ""Tree of Life"", or ""Magnolia""",Noah
659,abhinav-s,Really boring. Felt like a lifetime in the theatre.,1,7 April 2014,"I will keep this short and sweet. First, I am not Christian and do not know the story of Noah's Ark. It just felt as if the movie dragged on and on for hours. There was way too much overacting, completely crushing the realism. I couldn't help but laugh when the wife starts crying and talking to Noah about not killing the two sister twins. It sounded so fake, like she was having hiccups the entire time.Second, if they knew that the king was going to invade eventually, why didn't they just kill him on the spot when he first introduced himself. The giant rock things could have easily wiped him out without the whole fight sequence later on.Third, where did Gramps get the superpowers? I'm pretty sure God didn't give it to him. If he did, why was he wiped out during the deluge? How could he cure infertility...makes no sense since he is not divine, but just a man. Fourth, we assume that the family was living on the Ark for nearly a year, since Emma's character was nine months pregnant at the time. If they don't eat the animals, where did they get a year supply of food and drinking water considering there was no food or fresh water in the forest? Come on...logic people. I guess since it is a biblical story, the food and water were spawned magically. Lastly, Noah is worse than all men combined. He is a psychopathic nut job. God or no God, it is inexcusable to even think of hurting babies. I didn't mind that all of mankind was exterminated, they had it coming. Don't bother with this movie. It is such a snooze fest. I pretty much fell asleep for half an hour since they were just trying to kill time for 3/4 of the movie.",Noah

The dialog was just awful - pretentious, overwrought drivel.The bible is full of great stories, fairy tales from the childhood of our culture, but great stories. What Aronofsky has done is such a hatchet job. And this is the guy who made Pi, a wonderful picture. I wonder if privately he knows this is awful.BTW I don't know why the hullaballoo about christians being upset, Noah wasn't a Christian, I don't think he was even a jew- pre-Abraham, ya know.

They play their parts just fine, the storyline just isn't interesting or intriguing, at all.The movie doesn't really stick to the biblical version of the story nor does it completely re-write the story. Its a weird mix of the two that just does not really work for me. There are a few cool scenes with some neat CGI, but they don't even come close to justifying this long, slow film.",Noah
663,ModelOmega,Aronofsky's passion project is kind of a masterpiece.,10,1 April 2014,"First off, you should not plan to see Noah because it is a biblical epic, nor should you plan to skip Noah precisely because it is a biblical epic. You should however, see Noah because it is an amazing film, using the basic story of Noah's ark to deliver a fantasy action/adventure and a psychological horror story and deliver a very relevant ecological message that's subtle. The visuals are out of this world, particularly one scene depicting the creation of the universe from the big bang to a scientifically accurate representation of what Darwinian evolution would look like sped up about a million times, the whole scene would feel right at home in an episode of Cosmos. (Yes, you read that right.) Special mention must be made to Russel Crowe, who delivers the complicated picture of a man that both saves the world but is also supposed to let it die, and all of the weight one must feel about it. I can't praise this movie enough, it's basically perfect, if you are even the least bit curious about going, do so! You won't regret it.",Noah

Noah took his entire family aboard the Ark. That was his wife, three sons and their WIVES. Poor Ham wasn't left out of the mating loop, and Japheth was the oldest son, not the youngest. I don't mind adding some characters from the Apocryphal books, but the earth was NEVER barren before the flood. The weather was always good, and it never rained. All the water was held either in the Firmament or in the Great Pools Of The Deep. The movie gratuitously showed Noah drunk and naked near the end, not knowing what the meaning of ""uncovered his father's nakedness means"". Since Jennifer Connelly gave a convincing performance as a woman who would do ANYTHING for her children, I think the incest between Ham and his mother would have been convincing even in this bastardized plot. And it was the Ham's son Canaan, who was cast out, not Ham. Otherwise, they should have titled the movie, Noah, An Alternative Universe.",Noah

And he told him to built a big boat with a door and get all the animals on it. I don't know where he was knocking about that he was able to get a tiger and a badger....must've lived next to a zoo or summat. Anyway, God gave him two weeks notice and he got them all on somehow. It was rough but they got through it and eventually the water floated off and it was all fine. In fact he did his job too well because he saved too much. You can't move out there for stuff!

666,Jan_El_Senor,My review of Noah (spoilers),7,26 April 2014,"Let's leave religion out of the review (except for my note at the bottom). As a movie, Noah was both spectacular and a letdown to me. The first half of the film was the best. Basically, the setup is way better than the payoff. The prophetic dreams, the angels, the building of the ark and mounting tensions were all awesome. Noah is 100% bad-ass with the Creator leading him and backing him up making all that we see really cool. Then, we get to the ark in the water. It starts off with the excellent narration of creation visualized by the evolution of the Earth. While it uses the visualization of scientific evolution, we still end up with the Biblical (and perfect) Adam and Eve. The fall of man is depicted very faithfully to the stories. This is probably one of the best sequences of the film. The whole last section (pretty much the second half of the film) went downhill for me. We don't see Noah's visions anymore. We don't know if he's going crazy or is the Creator is still commanding him. Basically, Hermione is preggers, and Noah believes the Creator says he has to kill the baby when it's born if it is a girl. Lots of drama goes on. But, at the end she has twin girls and Noah realizes he can't murder the babies. Then we see the dove with the olive branch in its mouth, which seems to indicate Noah is still acting within the Creator's will. I guess I didn't like the second half because it became more of a different movie. The first half is pretty straightforward with the audience as far as what the Creator wants Noah to do. In the second half, all of a sudden the audience is left in the dark, and it's unclear whether Noah is still acting on the Creator's behalf. It's a little too much of a bait and switch. Oh. The angels were rad. Overall, I'd still say to check it out. It has some cool concepts, and maybe you'll like the second half better than I did.... ------------------------------------------------------------------- My thoughts on the religious adaptation: It's obvious a non-believer adapted this. Yes, other adaptations like The Ten Commandments and The Passion of the Christ made changes while adapting the material, but the reverence for the source material is clear. This movie doesn't seem to be made with the same reverence, but I'd still say it is respectful of the source material. At the end of the day, the changes did not offend me in any way....",Noah
667,jacobburbidge,"Visually impressive, but borderline blasphemous",4,24 August 2019,"I enjoyed pretty much every second of this film. Not one moment dragged and all the performances were top notch. But something was nagging in the back of my mind during this whole experience. And by the halfway point I found it. This film takes the Biblical narrative and completely rips it apart. Not just story-wise. But from the characters to the narrative that follows the flood. Say what you want about the Exodus film, at least it stays partially true to the story, given its many deviances. Noah does it's own thing and likes to play around with the story. From a secular perspective it's nothing to fuss about. But from someone who believes in the story and the morals it teaches, I take great issue with a film that turns Noah into a villain halfway through, makes up stories about angelic rock monsters and somehow forgets that Ham becomes the future of the African races without a wife to reproduce??",Noah
668,Riftmann,From great to meh,7,17 January 2015,"Half way through the movie, I was thinking this was the best adaptation of the Noah story I had ever seen, even beating John Houston's excellent adaptation and portrayal of Noah in the 1966 'The Bible' and was expecting to end up giving it a 9 or a 10. Ironically shortly after the actual flood started it turned into a weird soap opera on board the Ark. So 10 for the first half, a 3 for the second half, for a rounded up average of 7.The turning point for me was when Ham's love interest, Na'el asked for help from Noah, he refused, and she was trampled to death. It was all downhill from there. I'm not sure I've seen an Aronofsky movie before, but the second half was very dark.I guess I was expecting the Sunday school version, but with action. I wasn't expecting the drunken scene with Noah to be in it, or the nudity scene (The curse of Ham, which is a misnomer, but a contention for over 2000 year of what actually happen). Instead of ending with a feel good happy ending, it ended on a somber, depressing note.While I'm not an atheist, none of the departure of the story from the Bible bothered me. Anybody who seriously thinks the Noah's Ark story really happened is, well, bonkers.There were parts I really liked, Noah's telling of the creation story with current cosmology and evolution worked into it was great! The Watchers were wonderful. I loved the special effects. But most of the second half... was just a huge soap operatic mess.Some of the complaints I've heard are silly. Magic smoke putting the animals to sleep is wrong, but you believe all the animals could fit on the Ark, and water came from nowhere to flood the entire earth and then went to nowhere when it was dried up is okay? Any Noah movie that upsets Kenneth Ham and Ray comfort is doing at least something right.Spend more time with the cool animals coming to the ark scene, let Ham and Jepheth have a dang wife, and loose the stupid soap opera second half, and I would have given it a higher rating.And while not a bible freak in the least, people are wrong when they say that the baddie, Tubal-Cain is made up. He is named in the bible.I liked the acting, especially Emma Watson, Jennifer Connely, Logan Lerman, and of course Anthony Hopkins.My main problem was with the script in the second half. Poor Ham.

What I found was acting so wooden they should have built the ark out of it. The film was about 120 minutes too long and as others have said the CGI effects were awful. Russell Crowe seems to be replaying the serious, mumbly Gladiator role but without a decent script.

When I saw the cast of this film (Emma Watson and Logan Lerman) I got intrigued but the name of Aronoftsky sealed the deal (as I loved Black Swan and Mother!). The filmography and acting were absolutely and undoubtedly top tier but the writing and pace (like lot of his films) were huge problems for me. The movie could've easily been cut 40 minutes as they feel unnecessary and the plot takes a twist for the worse. The plotline of Noah becoming a villain with complexity rubs me the wrong way and I am not even Christian. It feels unnecessarily edgy or ambitious.,Noah

674,wsg31987,"Already underrated, a very old-fashioned Bible Epic, yet ahead of it's time",8,3 April 2014,"I'm a bit mystified by some of the negative press 'Noah' is getting. That Fundamentalist Evangelicals (and Muslims, for that matter) are offended is to be expected. That the general public has been so chilly to it is sort of tragic.In an age where Hollywood tentpoles have become maddeningly generic and redundant, that a movie as imaginative and earnest as 'Noah' would be booed by the public is downright depressing.Admittedly, I was a skeptic. But getting out of the theater I have become a believer in Darren Arronofsky's wild-eyed Bible Epic.It has something missing from the unrelentingly morbid ""Passion of the Christ"", or some of the duller movies aimed at religious audiences. It has something that has been missing from Biblical epics for a long time: fun.Because frankly, in it's first half, that's most of what Noah is. Like the classics of old such as Ben-Hur or Spartacus, there's swashbuckling excitement and genuine thrills to be had. Any talk about the movie being ""stupid"" for featuring giant rock monsters and a cartoony villain is, well, stupid. It's all good, rollicking fantasy fun. That it's silly should cause no controversy. It's a story about a guy who puts every species of animal on one boat, of course it's silly!And yet, Arronofsky treats the themes and message of the Noah story with the utmost seriousness. After the great flood comes, the movie grows decidedly darker, and plunges head first into heady old testament themes. The story of Abraham and Isaac gets broadly grafted on here.It is the weakest point in an otherwise great film. The scenes on the ark do go on a little too long, and the movie starts to drag in it's final act.But it's a relatively minor flaw. What truly makes this audacious movie work is the clear voice and sincerity of the director. This is the director's cut, a director's movie. It's not market-tested, bland mindless crap. Moviegoers who could enjoy transformers, yet think this movie is dumb, have received the great flood of schlock they deserve.But I'm getting away from the point, which is that 'Noah' is deeply faithful in both an intellectual and emotional way, to it's source material. It is also truly original, gutsy, and yes, goofy (in a good way) with it's production design. It looks less like 'Ben-Hur' or 'Spartacus' than 'Lord of the Rings' crossed with 'Mad Max'.If that sounds bad, well, I probably can't convince you otherwise. But I think the movie is visually interesting in a way many modern movies are not. It has a clear, unique visual style, and although it's fun recalls an old fashioned Hollywood bible epic, it doesn't look like one.So, overall, I'd strongly recommend you take a chance on 'Noah'. It's thoughtfulness, emotion, spirituality, and campiness are blended together in a unique and (almost) seamless package.",Noah
675,info-15837,I was entertained despite extravagant liberties taken with the familiar story,6,27 March 2014,"""Noah"" is a Russell Crowe movie based on the Bible story. Adam and Eve are banished from the Garden of Eden. Cain kills Abel, leaves the family and creates a huge following based on conquest and pillaging. Meanwhile their other brother, Seth, has a much smaller following lead by Noah. The people of Cain are destroying the land and encroaching on the peaceful existence of the people of Seth. Noah sees signs that he believes come from the Creator. The signs tell him to save the innocent creatures from a coming flood. Celestial water instantly creates a forest in the desert. Noah builds a vessel using the lumber from the newly created trees. He invokes help from the ""Watchers"" who look like gigantic transformers made of rock. Together, they spend years building an ark. Two of each kind of animal from the earth and sky march, slither, and fly to the ark where Noah and his family find a creative way to manage the plethora of beasts in a confined space. It starts to rain, the Earth is flooded, almost everybody drowns, and conflicts arise on the ark. There is a pregnancy, a prophecy, and a stowaway that creates havoc during several months afloat. Noah becomes a crazy man trying to read between the lines of exactly what the Creator wants him to do while he questions his ability to follow through on his vision. I was impressed by the acting at all levels. Russell Crowe is great as Noah. The other characters are portrayed very well. The story is very well told, although it takes some extravagant liberties with telling the familiar story. The fight scenes and the flood scenes are very good. There is a disclaimer during the credits that say that this is a work of fiction and that any similarities to any persons living or dead are coincidental. I was entertained. 6 out of 10 stars.",Noah
676,pkwsbw-1,"Quick review based on the movie, not side issues.",3,7 April 2014,"One of my favorite movies is Reds. If you scroll through the reviews, you see they are skewed by people enraged by the fact that the movie is a bit apologetic about communism. Similarly, reviews of Noah are greatly skewed by those complaining about the lack of Biblical accuracy. I feel that is irrelevant, especially since I've never read the actual story in the Bible. The fact is, this movie is poor all by itself. The action and dialog are plodding, the costumes look like they came from the gift store from some Vegas hotel, the color themes depressing, the special effects boring, and on and on. I would have given it less than 3 stars, but it was slightly fun to observe the all star cast. The whole feel of the movie is depressing from start to finish. Save your money and go see something else.",Noah
677,arunth,"The worst movie ever, probably by a black mass community",1,6 July 2014,Dear friends never ever watch this movie. In simple English we can say this is bu-- sh-t. And also I believe that there is more plot happened outside the movie than it was inside. As it looks like some hideous plot to corrupt what our creator did and the real Noah who really helped him to cleanse the world from evil. To me it looks like a movie created by the devil worshipers to demoralize the believing class. The Noah here in this movie is a psychic person who are obsessed by himself. I think the director tried to make a controversy so that he can gain something out with his failed project. I am also wondering how this stupid movie got over 6 ranking points. This really absurd. God help the director so that he will never create bullshit movies like this.,Noah
678,HellenKeller48,Don't Listen to the Haters,9,30 March 2014,"Although Noah, may not be accurate in a biblical sense, it was an exciting and serene movie nonetheless. Aronofsky did a great job of letting the Audience know what kind of man Noah was and Crowe did a more than Fantastic job at showing his true acting talent.The Negative Reviews about this movie are written by enraged Athiest who don't like believing in anything higher than themselves. And the ones who actually went to see the movie are even more mad at the film because they would definitely not have a place on the Ark. (haha).I do not, in fact, like how people who eat meat are portrayed as evil in the movie. It doesn't make much sense to me how they lived their entire lives in a wasteland only to survive off a couple seeds on the ground, not to mention the year they spent on the ark. With that being the only problem i have with this movie i have to give it a 9. There are a lot worse movies out there with higer ratings because they don't have athiest who didn't even go to the movie giving it a 1 star review. Overall, its a better than average movie jam-packed with action and drama that any movie goer would enjoy.",Noah

Then someone said...transformers. They said great, lets do it...enter the rock monsters. Result was...well...disappointing on many fronts.The actors were good. The effects, like so many other movies, also impressive. But it takes more than this, and this version was just lacking.

682,etherealmorningrise,"Noah is mind-bending, sometimes surreal, and altogether compelling spare a few caveats",7,31 March 2014,"I was looking forward to Noah for the better part of the last year mostly because I have an affection for some of this directors previous works. Pi, Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream are entertaining and partly disturbing. The Fountain is one of my favorite films and has made me cry on may occasions, thanks in part to it's beautiful imagery, surreal escapism, and impressive score.Noah is a different beast than these films in many ways. The scope is much larger. The religious overtones are more apparent than in former films like Pi and The Fountain which begin to hint at elements of religion and spirituality, but never take a full plunge. With the title Noah, people know what they are getting into when they watch this film.I myself am not a religious person. I grew up in a religious household and know the terrible story of Noah all too well. Some believe the Bible to be 100 percent accurate, but that is not the perspective I take when watching this film or reading that segment of the Bible. It is a fiction, and after watching Noah, an entertaining one to see one screen.I am most impressed by the colors and little escapes from the cold reality the characters are faced with in the film. The vignettes of sorts featuring a narrated monologue and beautiful imagery. It's pure escapism and allows Aronofsky to showcase his cinematic skills and dream-like tendencies. It pairs nicely against the mostly dark colors shown throughout the entire movie as it is washed in cloudiness and water.It's not perfect. Some of the acting is stale, particularly on the part of ""the sons"" in the movie. It was hard to take them seriously, in part because of the acting, but because they were so well groomed when compared with their father (Noah) and the women who were so much more natural looking (beautiful, but organic).Other elements didn't work so well either. The ""rock angels"" (as I have been calling them) are a pretty funny crossbreed between the Transformers and the Ents from Lord of the Rings. The religious zealots among us cry out in such a controversial manner that the angels are depicted in such a manner, but who cares really? They serve a functional purpose and additionally lend to the movie-like quality of the film, but at times are just comedic relief or plain cheese to watch. Fortunately, at other moments, like their conclusions during the battle that unfolds wherein they explode and ""return to the Creator"" was epic and suitable to the graphic novel sensibilities the film takes on.The last thing I despised was the ""stowaway."" The idea is not a bad one, but how it unfolds in the film seems particularly unrealistic (and this is in a film where I can accept the existence of god, rock angels, a boat constructed out of wood that can hold so many animals, etc.). The buildup is mediocre at best and this particular character (Cain's son) should have been left off the boat altogether where he was at least entertaining and well acted. This leads to another issue: the pacing inside the ark is a bit too slow for my tastes. The story kind of halts and we are just left to float with this disgruntled family.Ultimately though, this is an entertaining film with a lot of eye candy. The CGI is beautiful. The acting is generally very solid. The story of Noah is one I find comical (as a non-religious person), yet this did a good job of making something so well known a little bit different and fairly compelling. Yes, liberties are taken, but it makes the movie entertaining. I don't want an exact retelling of the story of Noah, that is what churches are for several times a year to dictate an ancient tale. The film of Noah in this incarnation is excellent for anyone who enjoys a bit of surrealism and escapism into a religious world filled with moral ambiguity and a real sense of god-fearing to it's beautiful catharsis.",Noah
683,alekperovaulker,"""The animals are more innocent than humans."" ""Noah"" – is the Year's First Must-See Movie! Jennifer Connelly as Naameh is superb.",8,29 March 2014,"Synopsis: When the World got into the darkness. When a man kills a man, brother kills a brother. When there is no mercy left, but inhumanity and unkindness. When the animals deserve more compassion than humans: The Creator speaks to Noah (Russel Crowe) through a series of mysterious dreams and asks him to save his wife Naameh, his sons Ham (Logan Lerman), Shem (Douglas Both) and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), and Shem's wife Ila (Emma Watson) who was adopted by Noah as an infant. Noah through his dreams was informed by The Creator about the destruction of the World. And there is no one except Noah and his family should have been survived, and yet, animals.The new film ""Noah"" stars Russell Crowe as the man chosen by God to collect pairs of Earth's animals on a massive ark to save them from a global flood. But how could Noah build that huge Ark alone? Darren Aronofsky offers us The Watchers, a race of fallen angels who were encrusted by hardened magma created when they all fell from Heaven to Earth. Even though, the Watchers were kind of unfriendly with Noah, in the end The Fallen Angels agreed to help Noah to complete his task assigned by God, and sacrifice their lives to protect Noah from Tubal-cain (Ray WInstone) as the Watchers believe that Noah is a man they came to help.Despite the Epic story of Noah's Ark, Darren Aronofsky suggests us his own story of a Man, who is not just hero, and anti-hero as well, which basically makes his film even better. In ""Noah"" we will see everything: starting with the flower that blooms from nothing, large scale scenes, The Watchers with kind of look like ""The Transformers"", the arrival of animals to the Ark, the flood, and destruction of the World. Furthermore, we will see as Noah being so determined with his task: believes that only the animals should survive – that after the flood he will have to kill his wife and children and himself, to prevent sinful humanity from angering The Creator again. But what's point of destroying the World, if the human still has no mercy after all? Officially, Oscar 2015 race can start with ""Noah"". Why do I think so? Well, there are a couple strong keys that might help 'Noah' to be nominated for the Oscars: Stunning Visual Effects, costumes, sounds, and more ever, the story, that will not bore you throughout the film.If you have seen the movies directed by Darren Aronofsky such as ""Requiem for A Dream"", Black Swan"", and ""The Fountain"" you will understand what is more important for Darren. This person can conquer your heart not just with stunningly cinematography, visual effects, and the story that might not leave you alone after watching the movie. Darren Aronofsky always uses any available opportunity to unbare the dark side of human beings. If you had a chance to see the films I've mentioned above, then you might agree with me. But without good actors, Darren Aronofsky would never be able to achieve what he has achieved now.Academy Award winner Russell Crowe stars as Noah will bring you two side of Noah: a good and a bad side. Russell knows exactly how to disappear in the character he needs to play. In my opinion, Russell was quite emotional in a couple scenes. He can make his viewers love him and hate him at the same time. But it's definitely not the performance of the Year, but his acting was quite solid to assure you, that his mission accomplished successfully.Jennifer Connelly has shared the screen with Russell Crowe before in ""Beautiful Mind: which brought her many Awards, including 'Oscar'. And she also had experience working with Darren in ""Requiem for a dream."" In ""Noah"" Jennifer is superb as Naameh.A dialogue with Noah was absolutely speechless. She delivered the Year's performance so far. Unfortunately, watching the movie in the theatre limits you in many ways. If I would have an ability to replay the same scene as many times as possible, I would definitely do that just to enjoy Jennifer's breathtaking performance over and over again.I have to admit, I was quite surprised seeing Emma Watson's performance in 'Noah"". As Ila, she was absolutely stunning and unique. The scene on the Ark with Noah is the beginning for Emma's brilliant acting career. If she continues to play the way she played in ""Noah"" – she will be having a very bright future.Darren Aronofsky brought us a different Noah: - Noah, that can be good and bad. But it does not matter how far he will go to save his family and animals from the flood. In the end, he will not fail the Creator. Because love, compassion, and mercy is all what we need to live our lives with dignity.",Noah
684,tyrone-the-man,Highly offensive trite,1,24 August 2014,"Such a pity about what the director did with this otherwise truly amazing story. I mean you couldn't have better ingredients than he had. Great actors, an accurate rendition of the shape of the Ark, not some Sunday School mixture between Dr Doolittle and Noah, and a proper budget to really get the ball rolling. But all he does is end up insulting those of us that do believe the bible account and insulting God, making him an impersonal unloving being. He even got the fallen angels cockeyed. It would be nice to unmake this fiasco and make a faithful version of it. It ends up being a SOUP Sandwich. To be honest, it's hard to even comment on the actors performances and these are some of my very very favorite actors in the business which makes it all the more distressing that they put their good names to this garbage. The fallen angels really took took the cake though, they were made to be the good guys when the bible account shows that their actions of materializing in human form and having children with the human women, led to the creation of the Nephilim who men of violence. This was the reason God wanted to destroy the earth, because they had made abominations that were destroying everything.",Noah

There is nothing about this story that is accurate to the old testament account, except the names and the rain.This movie is not trying to endear itself to the Christian community, quite the contrary, this picture is basically ""The 10 Commandments"" meets ""The Lord of the Rings""! There are 15 story tall stone monsters, hybrid animals never seen before, and a fight-for-the-castle that every Lord of Rings iteration seems to have.Noah is borderline psychotic, his Grandfather is a sorcerer, and there isn't a single reference to God, he's ""The Creator"", like we are all part of some maniacal video game.",Noah
686,mattleese87,Stunningly beautiful scenes can't make up for story alterations,7,3 January 2015,"WARNING! This review contains spoilers!Well, going into this movie I had been warned that it was a bit... odd, but I wanted to view it myself to draw my own conclusions. The first half of the film was fairly well done. I was a bit unsure about their portrayal of the Watchers but afterward I realized it was actually somewhat interesting and creative. The scenes were beautifully filmed with some breathtaking scenery and very lifelike costumes and sets that made you really feel you were there. The warm glow of the central fire in the ark that showed off the immense expanse of its interior was a very nice touch. However, it started getting weird just before they were set to depart on the ark... I had dismissed some of the earlier deviations from the story as reasonably-acceptable artistic liberty in order to add some level of interest. This included the before-mentioned Watchers (both their strange appearance and their siding with and helping of Noah), the murder of Lamech, the snake-skin artifact, and the fact that God didn't ever actually communicate with Noah beyond a couple vague dreams with bizarre imagery. But about halfway through the movie, suddenly Ham is considering rebelling against his father, a bad guy gets on the ark, Ila receives magical healing from Methuselah and pregnant on the ark, it's made to seem like God never intended on letting Noah and his family repopulate the earth, and then Noah seems like an absolute crazy man for believing that God (whom still never says a WORD in the movie to clearly define anything of his will) desires them to all perish as punishment for sharing in the sin of Adam and Eve. He thinks God intended to only save the animals and that he and his family would just live out their lives and die without having children. He believes this so much that he promises he will murder his grandchild if it is a girl. I mean I know that maybe they were trying to include a bit of the sacrifices other people in the Bible were asked to make in devotion to God, but it all felt very much like Noah was literally insane. Finally, when the ark reaches land and Noah has opted to disobey God just a second before killing two newborn granddaughters, he kinda becomes a weird hermit from his family on the top of Mt. Ararat and drinks himself until he's naked (which seems to happen a lot in the Bible...). There's no joy in finding land or receiving the promise of God that he will never cause another flood to wipe out mankind... the ending is depressing and the whole thing just fizzles out. So, in conclusion, I feel that a movie that had a lot of potential became the victim of its director's desire to make every story into an unbearable tragedy with a collection of deep concepts that make you keep trudging through it for more. It does definitely feel like Aronofsky wanted to first tell the story of how the human race deserves to be extinct for its sinful corruption that is inherent even in the best of us, but it could have been done a bit more subtly. It's very sad, some level of action that gets pointless by the end, with a rather skewed version of the story that I believe most Christians would frown upon. The pluses are beautiful cinematography, costume design, and set design, as well as some decent acting and creative concepts.",Noah
687,mixingbowl1,An enjoyable (if disjointed) take on a fairy tale.,10,12 April 2014,"I just saw ""Noah"" today in the theater, and while I walked away from it understanding that this was no narrative masterpiece or triumphant display of superb dialogue, I am giving it a rating of 10 out of 10... and here is why.Truth is, I think this film probably warrants an honest 7... a bit shy of where it currently sits on IMDb. It is a film with incredible production value, holds a few innovative ""stop-motion"" type sequences (evolution, etc..) that are truly engaging to watch, and also boasts an all-star lineup. Unfortunately, I felt the story arc suffered a bit by being piecemeal about the message it was trying to send. Better to stick with one, central theme and be true to it, than try to please everyone. I won't ruin it for you, but I think you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. This doesn't sink the ship, mind you (ya like that?), but it hurts the film IMHO.That said, the rating of this film is being heavily bogged down by people of the religious persuasion, and it's simply not fair, hence my rating of 10 in an effort to undo some of the bias. This is not the Bible's ""Noah."" No, this is creative license that used the aforementioned as a jumping-off point. When I first heard of this movie, I could sense the imminent controversy. And BOY, was I right. The studios must know by now that when you adapt peoples' fairy tales to the big screen, they want it told verbatim. Problem is, to all but the ""faithful,"" the Bible is merely an ancient tome that is an absolute mess from a literary (as well as MORAL) standpoint, and even if Mr. Aronofsky HAD released a film based exclusively on the source material, it would have felt every bit as disjointed as the book from whence the story came, and certainly would not have interested anyone in the ""sane and rational"" demographic, i.e. NOT religious.In short, they had some good ideas here... hell, a few great ones. But it simply did not coalesce in a way that was consistent enough to enjoy on all levels. A good effort, though, and worth watching.7/10",Noah
688,holics-gabor,"""It may contain some Biblical references""",3,27 August 2014,"Of course I didn't expect the exact Biblical parallelism, but this movie was like the director never red it in the Bible, only heard the story, told by a Buddhist monk, who heard it from a tribal witch, who once saw it on an illustration of a 19th century children's Bible...Putting Noah into a post apocalyptic world, when Earth was more flourishing than any time after the flood? (For crying out loud, what the heck they ate and drink, when Noah forbade his son even from taking a flower from the ground, they were against animal killing, and so on?)Noah forbidding and locking out people from the Ark, when actually he was preaching for 120 years, like ""come into the ark, or you'll be dead""?Then about the CGI: cheesy, lame, obsolete. My personal ""favorite"" was the cheap welding mask used as a prop for the warriors. Even in TV series at the sixties they were more careful with picking the right costume...Only positive thing was Russel Crowe's playing.An addition: (I wrote the above about the first 1:30 hours.) Making a man-hater & killer out of Noah, who thinks God wants to abolish the entire mankind, and wants to use him to kill everyone (even his grandchildren) makes me say: I hope this writer/director won't make any more movies!I feel sorry for this poor guy though: he must spend 24 hours with himself daily...",Noah

This is the ""Noah"" Bible story the way ""West Side Story"" is ""Romeo and Juliet"": the later one began with the skeleton of the first story, but fleshed it out a whole 'nuther way. Once you accept that this is at best a distant relative of the Biblical Noah, then you can enjoy the movie the way you'd enjoy any other imaginative special effects movie. The story flowed well, the effects were cool, the acting was good. I thought everyone in it did a good job. The only thing that really gave me pause was that Noah's younger sons had no wives, and when the oldest brother's wife gave birth to twin girls, Noah's wife joyfully said that these girls would fill that role when they grew up. (""He has given us what we needed!"") That's just creepy. (Especially since Noah could have saved Ham's girlfriend earlier on in the movie.) But all in all, I enjoyed the movie. Inspirational?

690,gra_ham_man5,"Ambitious, beautiful and epic.",9,30 March 2014,"Darren Aronofsky has always been an ambitious filmmaker. He constantly strives to bring us deeper and darker character driven pieces whilst being completely honest in the morality of each tale told. 'Noah', his sixth feature film to date, is no different. It breathlessly tells the familiar Biblical story and is beautiful, epic, and gut-wrenching all at once.I went into the film not sure what to expect. I've never been a very religious person, though I have a respect for past religious films (such as Passion of the Christ) for what they are and try to be. Shockingly, Noah stands tallest amongst them. It doesn't exist just to tell a tale but to remind us of who we've become and who we can be, not only as people but as a civilization. The film has been painstakingly crafter to appeal simultaneously to those of faith and those who question it. Never does it come off as preachy or self-indulgent, only as a cautionary tale of where we (apparently) were and where we may be going again.On a technical level the film is absolutely stunning. Several times throughout I was pleased to experience one of the best things about watching cinema: epic chills. The score is vast, the special effects seem to disappear into reality (especially the water scenes) and the cinematography reminds us of the beauty of the world we live in.Let me say that, without a doubt, this is Russell Crowe's very best performance in many, many years; Most likely since 2003's Master and Commander. He plays Charlton Heston better than Charlton Heston. His screen presence is powerful, single to none, and he consistently portrays a man of conflict, love, and loyalty to his beliefs. Jennifer Connelly also gives an excellent performance and it's great to see these two fantastic actors back on the screen together. The remaining cast does their parts well, though don't come close in comparison.I'm surprised just how much I love this film. I not only admire it for what it accomplishes but for the ambitious chances it takes. It is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the senses, all at once heart-wrenching, beautiful and powerfully epic. 9/10 Fallen Angel's",Noah
691,camerican555,"Looking past the terrible adaptation, still a terrible movie",1,31 March 2014,"This is one of the worst movie adaptations of a book I have ever seen. This movie essentially takes a very old story and twists it into a sick story which maintains few of the key elements of the original tale. This is not the story of Noah as we see it in the Bible, this is the story of a man that shares the same name and does a few of the same things, but in no way is it the same story.Even if we are to look past the terrible adaptation and inaccuracies to the original stories, and look at it purely as its own story and movie, it was still abhorrent. Too cheesy in some areas (rock angels? really?) and sick and twisted in others. It is legitimately a really stupid movie that just kept getting worse and worse. I would like to also add that, as a Christian, I was also highly offended by this film. They took a Bible prophet that has been looked up to as a devout follower of God, and turned him into a blood-stained psychopath. What kind of picture is this painting of all people who follow God? That we're crazy? Nice try at doing a plug for evolution in there as well, totally saw that. Overall this movie is entirely inaccurate to the original story. Which is something that I can totally look past, I did for Eragon which I can appreciate as a good movie even though they ruined the story. I would very much be open to doing that for this story.

692,flyermay,How can a movie about Noah be so disappointing?,4,29 March 2014,"I only had one reason to watch this movie -since I heard this tale hundreds of times from a young age- it was simple curiosity on any insights it could provide about that particular period of history, the events, or the characters involved; I mean, something beyond what we all already know -like an extension or complement to the short tale written in the bible, or even a deeper interpretation of it all... well, that didn't happen. Actually, you could argue that it was the complete opposite.I don't think there's anything wrong in adapting a story for modern audiences, but for God's sake not completely disregarding everything but the names of the main characters and the central action around which everything revolves. Which in this case ranged from making parts of the tale remind Tolkien's Middle Earth -with some sort of stone Ent-like creatures helping Noah build the arc and battle to protect him against his enemies- to dressing the characters in cool jackets with hoodies, shirts, boots, and even trousers... women included. And that without even getting into any spoiler; like when Noah takes on another biblical character's test... well, dual test -I guess to make it greater! To make this short, what I'm getting at is: if they don't really like these ancient stories as they are -whether because they think they are not cool enough or because the period is unattractive- then why don't they just do any other thing, perhaps also with an ark and a flooding, in any other cool world or time of their choice; and of course, call it something else more suitable? Why do they have to sell us these mishmashes that don't contribute absolutely anything new as if we where dumb suckers what would go along with anything as long as the special effects and characters look cool on a screen? But maybe I'm blaming the wrong people; maybe it's true that no one would pay to watch these movies if, for example, Noah wore a simple robe, or no one's ass got kicked. Or maybe it's actors like Russell Crowe who are to blame, because they wouldn't do it without looking cool in modern style cloths, or without playing the hero in a couple of action scenes.Whatever the reason, rather than cool, these movies end up looking really stupid. They come across as either: the creators have no insights into the story or just have nothing of interest to tell; they just make these movies for children who are not concern with anything but what is presented directly in front of them; or they are simply taking us all for a ride by just reselling any universally recognizable name, such as ""Noah"", to make a quick buck.",Noah

699,agisaak,"A decent film, many of the reviews have been somewhat strange...",7,15 January 2017,"I just saw this film, and while I don't consider it to be one of Aranofsky's best it was certainly enjoyable. I felt the major characters were well-acted, and I think that Aranofsky's take on the moral burden placed upon Noah is in many respects more interesting than the spartan account one finds in Genesis.In interest of full disclosure, I should point out that I am not even remotely religious, and as such am more interested in the story itself than biblical accuracy.That being said, though, I am actually rather perplexed by the number of reviews which have taken issue with inconsistencies between the film and the usual Christian interpretation of the flood story.This is an odd position to take since Aranofsky is neither religious nor Christian -- he was raised in the Jewish tradition and while Christianity and Judaeism may share the same source materials, they in many cases have very different interpretations of these sources. Moreover, there is a great deal of material present in Jewish folklore which isn't directly mentioned in Biblical texts.The Nephilim (aka the Watchers aka the big stone monsters aka 'the giants' in the KJV), for example, may receive only passing mention in the opening verses of the Noah narrative, and are generally ignored altogether in Christian accounts. As a gentile, however, I really have no idea how this notion is fleshed out in Jewish traditions and what role the Nephilim play in Jewish traditions.I'd be very interested in reading more reviews of this title from a Jewish rather than a Christian perspective, since it is presumably the Jewish view which informs Aranofsky's take on this narrative.",Noah

701,banderle,An exceptional film reverent of the essence of the Biblical account,9,4 April 2014,"This is a brilliant, compelling, challenging, thought-provoking, and in the end enjoyable, film. My apologies if, in seeing it, you are offended by it. I loved it. It made me emotional at several points. It provoked lively discussion on our way home. The film takes utterly seriously the Judeo-Christian belief in God, God's relationship with creation, and the faith assertions of the Genesis stories of early human civilization. Embellishments abound, yes, but I applaud them. Despite the whining from evangelical and conservative Christians, as a Presbyterian minister I argue that nothing I saw in this film lies in contradiction to Genesis 6-9, and that's the only thing that matters: remember, ""the one who is not against me is for me."" Yes, folks, the ""rock monsters"" you've heard aboutclearly a wonderfully creative attempt to render fallen angels, or possibly to make sense of the delightfully enigmatic ""Nephilim"" of Genesis 6 and Numbers 13. Why not? And why not have one voiced by real-life ""rock-monster"" Nick Nolte? There is also the sense of a sort of living Biblical exegesis on screen: the touching scenes of Noah and family representing something of the hope God had for what humans were meant to be, and conversely, the scenes of Tubal-Cain's self-centered, destructive, broken humanity, played brilliantly by Ray Winstone. The disturbing but eventually redemptive arc of Noah's character, leading him to contend with his own demons, and meant I think simply to portray the toll that a genuine, devoted faith in God can take, is compelling. The female roles are as strong as one could hope for characters in a prehistoric society. Jennifer Connelly as Noah's wife is crucial in, let's say, altering--for God's sake?--the potential outcome of this scenario that Noah with best intention believes is right; and therefore putting her, in this story at least, in real partnership with Noah rather than just a female extra. Emma Watson puts in a great performance as a young woman whose change in destiny serves as an object lesson in the importance of women's roles. Performances are stellar all around. There is at one point a scene, relatively brief and experienced from Noah's viewpoint, of human savagery and violence in a society hopelessly broken down, that packs the punch of any horror film I've seen, and qualifies as a way to visualize Hell. Why is that of redeeming value? Because a challenge like that to the human conscience, like a mirror held up to us to say ""do you really think you know how bad it can get...or got?"" and thereby pushing us not to let it happen, is in my opinion one thing that faith is supposed to do, and is sorely lacking in the entertainment mindset of a privileged society. That's of value. And the movie itself is. I encourage anyone with the remotest interest in it, to go and see. 6 Nephilim-thumbs up.",Noah
702,m-haan11,"An OK movie, don't read those hate reviews",7,15 April 2014,"After seeing this movie last night, I was scrolling through some of the reviews here. And I must say, these reviews gave me more joy then the movie. Not that the movie is that bad, but some reviews here are just hilarious. People going bananas over the fact that the makers of the movie raped the original story in the Bible. First up, they have stated that it's just an interpretation of that story. Not a direct translation. Second, it's a made up movie plot based on a made up story in a made up book. So don't get your panties all twisted up! If you believe that this story from the bible really happened, then you just need yourself get looked at by your doctor.Russell Crowe plays Noah, who builds an ark to survive the pending flood and save and look after all the animals. Along the way he gets it into his head that he and his family must die along with the rest of humanity. For that he is willing to kill his unborn grandchild. People are going crazy over that fact! ""Noah is such an unpleasant man bla bla bla"". Hello people, we are talking about a time where serving God is more important then your own family. There is a story in the Bible about a dude who killed his child for no reason. Just because God wanted it and to show his loyalty. So why go all crazy about the fact that Noah would do the same. Obviously it was pretty normal back then.As a viewer who does not anything in common with any kind of religion, this review should have made that fact clear, I enjoyed this movie. It's not a masterpiece and also not the SFX bonanza that the trailer had us believe. But it's OK for an evening of fun and beautiful pictures of Iceland and rockmonsters who look like banged up Transformers. This is sounding more and more like a review of Neverending Story but you get the idea.It's a movie that has more in common with how we treat the earth today then the way they behaved back then. This is made clear through some subtle hints by the makers but I guess most religious freaks are just to plain stupid to get that. Also after seeing this movie, it's painfully clear why so many church people are okay with abusing small boys. The story says it's okay to have sex with your own family and it's a small step from incest to child abuse. We also see it in this movie and this is something that should have been corrected. Two of Noah's sons don't have wives aboard the vessel. Then the oldest son has twin girls and the mother says: ""God sends us what we need"". So God sends them two girls so the two boys can have sex with their nieces. Nice one God. If Noah's family is worth saving by God, surely there must have been two girls out there worth rescuing. After all, they must repopulate the earth. Or was Noah right and should they die along with the rest of mankind. If having sex with your niece is seemed okay, then they might as well.",Noah

This is never told to the audience, but if you rub your nipples gently when Jesus appears, you will feel his spirit deep inside you.

707,denisejatkins,Much better than the haters want you to think,7,8 April 2014,"I felt I had to review this as there are so many unjustly scathing reviews on here. Noah is a well made film based on a Bible story. It is flawed, hence a 7 star movie not 10, but worth an awful lot more than the 1 star many people are giving it - mostly over enthusiastic Christians trying to stop people seeing it because it doesn't tell quite the version they want it to tell. The film presents some genuine moral dilemmas, which given the subject matter seem perfectly understandable. Noah believes that the planet has been corrupted by humans and would be a better place without them. As a result he starts to doubt whether his own family deserves to survive the flood if he is to follow the creator's instructions correctly. This adds to the drama, as does the sub plot with one of his sons starting to doubt his father's methods. They needed to take some liberties and extrapolate from the brief source material or there would be little human drama, and it is inevitable there would be disagreements among the family in such circumstances. The film is beautifully shot and generally well acted. Some of the dialogue is a little weak and a couple of scenes feel unintentionally silly, which loses it a couple of stars. But it never shies away from the inherent darkness of the subject matter and presents it for the messed up story that it really is - there's not really any other way to portray genocide! The bits showing the horrors of the flood and the sins of man that brought it about are truly disturbing. I'm an atheist but was raised with Christian stories and I felt the film was true to the source material but balanced it well with a more modern viewpoint, neither taking the bible too literally nor dismissing it completely. You can't make a film like this without courting controversy but I think Darren Aronovsky has done a very good job of balancing history, myth and science to create a compelling story. It's very well acted for the most part and stunning to look at. The costumes are also worth a mention as I thought they were really good, believably handmade looking without being too primitive for what was a pretty advanced society. My advice is to ignore the haters and make up your own mind!",Noah
708,Kw1373,A balanced view,7,22 April 2014,"After watching this fascinating and somewhat haunting movie, I came here to see what everyone else thought. I went thru 6 pages of reviews and saw that most people were opposite ends of the scale with majority hates and some loves for this movie. Guys, while this movie is not a 9 or 10, it certainly does not deserve 1 or 2 stars. Get a grip people!What I liked about this movie were special effects (I'm a sci-fi fan), smooth directing (not perfect of course), tremendous acting, gripping action, provocative take on where we came from, wrapped thinly around a biblical backdrop (a plus not a minus). What wasn't very good were lack of clear identify (was it biblical, drama, sci-fi, etc), some oddities (why did it take fallen angels 10 years or so to build the ark), limited sci-fi elements (haha for me I cannot get enough), and not a particularly satisfying end (which also gave it an eerie feel).7 out of 10",Noah

But when I turned this movie on, I knew from the moment the movie started with the really bad CGI and the mention of watchers that this movie was going to going down hill from there. Then the movie opens and Noah's Grandfather Methusalah is supposedly killed. Next thing you see is Noah and his family living what it comes to be revealed, a waste land with no apparent means of survival, other then the occasional animal. But apparently according to this movie Noah is some sort of vegetarian or something because he has his kid asking why someone would kill an animal, and the other kid says to eat it. But what really gets me is the fact that the movie has these rock creatures. I will submit that the bible does mention that before the flood that there were giants, but who knows what that means. Anyway, the fact that these creatures even are part of the story is so ludicrous, that it would seem that the film maker just wanted to make this bible story look like all the people in the world that believe it are just a bunch of idiots, and need to come back to reality. Then the movie would have you believe that these watchers helped Noah build the Ark.

From most of comment i have read, i can come to a conclusion that this movie is not for bible or other religious tradition fetishist. It is even possible to count this movie as a religious epic drama, but there are still people who proclaims Aronofsky as an infidel. The crew in the movie are not a church orchestra, so do not expect from them to blabber exact same stories you heard.The movie itself is not fascinating like other Aronofsky movies, but it would be very harsh to say it is boring and worthless.

711,mason-shaw,Noah,6,29 March 2014,"Darren Aronofsky is known for his striking films; turning heads with obsessive characters, consistently seeking for the one true creator. It was only a matter of time before finally, he was unleashed upon the tyrant and mother story of it all, thus being Noah.Many know the story of Noah's Ark, but nobody has seen it in quite the way Aronofsky portrays it. The film itself is seen through the fruitful eye of its creator and much like the majority of the story and it's cast, the audience is left breathless, not by a compelling script of cleanse, but rather by a two and a half hour tale of self indulgence. With a Blockbuster budget and a cast of familiar faces, it was certain that Aronofsky would have his way in delivering what can be seen as a portrait of imagination and predictability. Fresh insertions of Nick Nolte's character into the story, cleansed the puddles that were left stagnant with a bitter taste from the opening credits, shining little light upon the certain darkness that was destined to fill the screen. Although the insertion of 'The Watchers' can almost be seen heavily resembling the 'Rock biters' in a Never Ending Story-esque fashion, it did add to the entertainment of what could then be related as a stab into certain beliefs, the age-old war of Science versus Religion. Parting side with neither in mind.Russell Crowe is franticly attempting to reprise his role of Maximus Meridius in an attempt to reach back into Gladiator fame, probing us throughout the film, asking us as an audience once again if we are in fact 'Entertained' Well, I tell you what Russell, It is lucky that Anthony Hopkins' role of Methuselah was there to keep everyone intact, and the end, surprisingly providing a craving for Berries and a longing to sit down with my Grandfather?The film does however bare a fluctuation of voluptuous visuals within the Mise-en-scene, delivering a candy like portrayal to the eye. Its fruitful indulgences dares you to take a bite into it's CGI filled garden, tempting your taste as the devilish snake sneaks upon you, only to have you wake up from a colour coma to realise what you are in fact watching.All in all, if you are looking for something to kill two and a half hours of your time go and catch this film, just don't expect a Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream-esque reliability from Aronofsky, instead head in open minded and maybe, just maybe, you will also survive the storm.

There is an art and technique to writing a feature length screenplay. It needs to have a three-act structure, certain dramatic elements, plot points, and a character arch. These are found in the movie Noah - not in the four short chapters of the Bible. The movie works, the characters feel real. The production design is top notch, with its attention to detail. Overall the movie shows how Noah found grace in the heart of God, and was warned of a coming judgment. Noah believes God, and builds an ark to save himself and his family.

Stick to the original story! This weird abstract nonsense by Darren Aronofsky made me think he had lost the plot, literally!, and made it up as he went along! He is obviously a Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) wannabe, but this was supposed to be about characters from the Old Testament, not Middle-earth! Imagine how Tolkien fans would feel if Noah showed up in the Shire with the Transformers to help in The Hobbit. If you want a reasonably good example of how the Bible can be translated onto the screen, watch Son of God, starring Diogo Morgado, or the excellent Emmy nominated mini-series The Bible.

He is an atheist, who directs a bible-based movie, in which God is shown as a cruel god. The costume design doesn't transports me to the epoch in which the Noah's story happened; the music sounds like the budget was low; and the cinematography is NOT admirable. All this movie is horrible, cruel, and false, except for the boat and the flood, and that's because this movie doesn't matches neither a bit with the original story in the bible. But one truth this movie shows us, and it is that when you are making an adapted story, there's no rules. That means that an adapted story can be 100% different than the original story, and under that concept, the director is a master; is a master of the distortion.

Before I explain why its so bad, let me just tell you that this movie tries to make you care but everything just makes you laugh. For me that is the definition of a bad movie.Lets start with the good things first:Visuals They are amazing. Both graphically and artistically you have really good shots. Some of them are completely weird but weird is fun! Without spoilers there is an amazing ""stop-motion"" sequence that even if you don't want to waste money or time watching this movie, you should see it. Go to youtube!The ambient OK, some people may disagree but I believe they were able to deliver the ambient they wanted. Some may like it, some may hate it. I liked it.Now... Bad things!The writing Ouch, ouch, ouch. It was so bad! In almost 2 hours of movie there was like 3 dialogs that were actually okay! Poorly written, very poorly written. But the plus was that it made me laugh a lot! (I was alone in the theater with my sister so I didn't disturb anyone). I can't give examples without spoiling, sorry.The acting The actors are all great but I believe this was a director choice... He decided that all actors should over dramatize all their expressions, all of them! You are happy? Over do it! Sad? Over do it! Pain? Over do it!The characters This movie was completely plot driven and then in the final part they try to make us actually care about the characters. You can't do that, its one of the basic rules of cinema. They were all poorly developed and the bad writing didn't help any of them. The realistic side of things Okay, this movie is not suppose to be realistic but at least get the proportions right! The arc had 2 floors outside and inside it had 10 floors. The elephants were almost as tall as 1/3 of the arc. It doesn't make sense (along side many other things that I can't spoil...)In the final, I would not recommend anyone to pay to watch this, unless you want to have a good laugh.

723,time-bomb,Spectacular Movie,8,27 March 2014,"I found myself thinking about Aronofsky's Noah way after the credits were gone. Aronofsk's movie to me was an amazing movie, full of many undertones in the storytelling and on subject matter that one can relate to todays modern world, as many of the flaws Humanity has in this movie are very much still present in our world and society today. The story for me was very true to what Noah at least to be as someone with faith is about. The movie Aronofsky has made is Visually amazing, the story touches on many aspects of the human condition true to a lot of Aronofsky's past works. If you have seen Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain you will find yourself immediately identifying this film as something made by Aronofsky the style is their and even the musical score rings true in the epic feel of what his work is known for. The acting was excellent and everyone in the movie played their part just perfect. You will find a lot to think about in this movie. The burden of making huge decisions, carrying the responsibility of being human and wanting to preserve this earth we call home. The issues of life and death side by side with creation and destruction, Pain and joy. The respect of nature and our failure to recognize the value of were we live and only acknowledging and treating with respect what we see as rewarding to us by only placing value on things because they give us something instead of respecting and preserving, all glorious things. This movie is powerful its got a great story that should appeal to anyone, it has amazing visuals, the acting is excellent as the cast does nothing but deliver an amazing performance. One of many scenes which are memorable is a happy but also sad scene with Anthony Hopkins about living in the moment and without fear which involves him finding a fruit berry. Whether you like epic movies or your looking to see something that may make you think a little. I recommend this movie to anyone that appreciates good cinema.",Noah
724,moviefan1017,An original take on the well-known story,6,20 April 2014,"First and foremost I would like to mention that this is not your typical religious/spiritual film. It is an original take on the tale of Noah and the Ark, and I did well on knowing that before going to see the film. For those of you looking for a ""feel-good"", God-pursuing, spiritual experience, I would recommend going somewhere else. Having said that, here's what I thought about the film:I can honestly say that it was an interesting experience in the sense that I've never seen this kind of perspective on a Biblical story before. I would be careful on calling it a ""realistic"" take on the story of Noah because it has some fantasy elements to it. For example, those rock giants that helped Noah build the ark. Personally, I disliked those giants. I feel that the movie could've been better if they were taken out. That fight between them and the men made me feel like I was watching the battle of Isengard in LOTR: the Two Towers, and thus, made me forget I was watching a story adapted from the Bible. Apart from those rock giants that were seriously out of place, I enjoyed the film. I liked the fact that Noah was depicted as he probably truly was, and not as the saint he is usually depicted as. You could see that Noah was a God-fearing man, but at the same time he had his own inner struggles and demons. He was just a man, and the task put upon him was simply too much. I see this film as a study of the character of Noah and how he copes with the task God asked him to fulfill. In technical aspects, the film was visually stunning. Although I wasn't too enthralled by the animated opening sequence, I enjoyed the rest of the visuals. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was appropriate, and the acting, solid. I call it ""solid"" because that is how it was. It wasn't outstanding, I don't expect Russell Crowe or J. Connelly getting any awards, but they certainly did a good job portraying the characters in their own way. In conclusion, I enjoyed the film, it's not a film I would see twice in the theater, but I enjoyed it. The fantasy elements were a little out of place, but the realistic take on the character ( notice I didn't say ""story"") of Noah made up for it. If you are a hardcore Christian who is looking for a faithful adaptation of the Biblical tale, don't watch the film. If you have an open mind about this kind of story, then watch it because it is a curious perspective on the tale.",Noah
725,thestash_16,Inaccurate and slanderous,1,21 April 2014,"Another movie that will no doubt ruin the minds of the blind. So this movie portrays demons as the ones who helped build the ark... meaning the demons are on God's side? But demons are those who rebelled against God. It also portrays Noah as a violent murderer. All this movie does is portray good as bad and bad as good. But thats how the devil made this world. I can't wait til God does wipe evil men of this earth so we never have to see anything like this garbage again. People who value their minds and thinking ability should avoid this. Read the Bible account and actually know the truth rather than accept the slander and untruth in this movie.

The movie makers decided to go a bit further and changed the story noticeably. Those changes made it ridiculous for me and they can also make it offending for some. Their depiction of Noah's character differs greatly from mine, so I find it hard to swallow.While disappointed by the bigger picture, I like many of the scenes in the movie. I identified some of them easily and I liked those. I disliked some others in the context of Noah, but I wouldn't really mind seeing them in some story unrelated to Noah. Anyway, Aronofsky did a lot of great work there.My feelings are ambiguous. Being a Christian, it feels like half-truism to me, the truth being present to make swallowing the lie easier. The snake in the garden of Eden did just the same to be more persuasive. That's why I call it a diabolic story.",Noah

It takes itself way to seriously, I had to stop myself from bursting out laughing at some points. I mean come on, giant rock beasts as fallen angels? Seriously?The reason I give it five stars is the mainly the visuals, some of which were pretty specular and gave me chills. And, if I'm being honest, the film was going smoothly enough (if you ignore the rock transformers) until after boarding the ark where it just went all downhill. Did they seriously think they could make a family boat trip all that interesting.

The plot bore a less than passing resemblance to a lesser known book named ""Genesis"" (a few of you may have read it, but Aronofsky clearly didn't); and there were snippets from a grab bag of other stories in the same book, along with a whole bucket load of meaningless tripe that added nothing to the story and didn't really make much sense.I assume the mythical creatures are loosely (very, very loosely) based on the Nephalim, but they seem more like uncoordinated Ents.If you want an Epic, mythological story, you're probably better off with the 300 sequel or Hercules; if you want acting, don't watch this; if you're planning to see a movie, steer clear of Noah. It's a complete washout on that front!",Noah
732,jefferysikes911,The only biblical connection is the name,2,4 April 2014,"First you must remember that this is a Hollywood movie, its entertainment, its not a documentary as a matter of fact it has almost nothing to do with what is written in the actual texts of the bible . About the only facts related to biblical text are the use of the name Noah, and his association with a very large ship with lots of animals on board which survive a flood. Other than that, Hollywood takes their Stoic philosophia, based poetic license, to define the events of biblical text in their terms. For those looking for Hollywood action this movie has that in spades, for people looking to acquire an understanding of biblical text, this move has nothing in common except the very basics I explained earlier, there is a Man named Noah, There is a boat (ship) and there are animals and there is a flood. I gave it a 2 because as a biblical student, who is well aware of the written account of Noah, and I have heard both the actor that plays Noah, and the movie producers attempt to indicate its biblically accurate, which is most certainly not true. Noah is not a documentary, its simply an action flick which borrows with great imaginative interpretation, some of the major events and Characters of the biblical account.",Noah

The big problem is the CGI ( Visual Effects) in the movie. It's horrible. The Watchers look like a stone aged Transformers that have problem with his back. Some animals don't even look realistic. The only problem is only the CGI. I think the other things in the movie are OK. Darren Aronofsky just prove himself more and more as one of the best director in this century. He has made so much quality work, and Noah is also one of it. The performances in the movie was just amazing. The movie would be a lot better if it have better CGI.

735,caitriona-shanahan,Three potentially interesting movies struggling to escape one almighty mess,6,25 February 2016,"The starting point for this movie was the original story in Genesis, including elements that are not particularly well known e.g. Noah's drunkenness. Aronofsky and Handel added in details from apocrypha, such as Watchers, and then threw out parts of the Genesis tale that interfered with the story he wanted to tell - which seems to have been a morality play about man's impact on the environment and the threat of global warming. And that would have been a worthy movie, but - maybe it was not the story that the screenwriters wished to examine.Stories similar to the Great Flood of Genesis are found in the mythology of many cultures. All involve the destruction of the human race, caused by the creator's despair at our wickedness and cruelty. Only one man and his family are chosen to survive this trial, and to recreate humanity. The man chosen must hold onto his faith and innate goodness while letting all others - including innocents - die. There is an enormous cost to him and his family. Was this an examination of the cost of belief? The thin line that people of faith must walk between trust and extremism?Or maybe I'm over-thinking it. Maybe Aronofsky and Handel saw Roland Emmerich's ""2012"" and figured they could totally top it? They'd have an ark, and frightened mobs attempting to get on board, but they'd throw in stone transformers and a Gandalf/Galadrial-type character on the mountain to conjure up insight and the odd miracle.Whatever the intention was, it was never clarified, and consequently, the movie lurches clumsily in narrative and style from one perspective to another.It's a great cast, who signed on I suspect for different stories - so their performances are at odds.So much promise, so little delivered.",Noah

Well, it wasn't. ""Noah"" as it is, delivers great story with depth, nice, a bit modernized view of the Biblical story of Noah, with nice touch of Aronofsky's visual style. The acting was good, the characters were slowly evolving, showing how the upcoming events impacted their personalities and their response to these events. I went to the cinema to be entertained, with not high expectations, but I admit it: the movie delivered. Yet there were some letdowns. If you have seen the other classics of Aronofsky - starting from Pi and all the way to Black Swan, you would easily see that ""Noah"" looked different. It was not anything like he did before. Yes, the style used to visualize some of the story, was 100% his old style, but the story... the story was not delivered how I expected it to be, from what I have seen before.

737,sydney-swans-1,Far from the disaster people are making it out to be,8,9 April 2014,"Let me start by saying that my personal beliefs on the bible are irrelevant to this film. Here is why.Much has been said about how much the film not only digresses from it's source material (the Bible and Noah's well-renowned story) but it shouldn't really matter. This is a film. If I wanted to see adaptions of factual events, I would watch a documentary on the subject. I'm not saying films shouldn't be faithful to it's original story, but it doesn't matter to me personally. Whether a film is realistic or not, faithful to it's source story or not, I don't care. If you can go in with this attitude, there is no reason you shouldn't like this film.It's got pretty much everything a great film needs: solid acting, with the occasional moments of brilliance (particularly from Emma Watson), lots of emotion and drama mixed with both large and small-scaled battle scenes. It's also, surprisingly, got a good sense of character study. The film should be appreciated for it's bold move to create Noah into his own separate character that had emotions, and a story. The Noah we've all seen dozens of times is a generic biblical figure who builds an ark and relates with God. Yet we've never seen how someone like Noah connects with his family, as well as his own values. To me, seeing his journey and seemingly straight-forward task descend into crisis was interesting and made it stand out from all the other religious films I've seen.I don't follow any particular religion, just maintain values from a range of different religions, so this film didn't offend me or my beliefs at all. I was able to look past all the unrealistic elements and enjoy the film. I can understand how it would offend people, or even baffle others, but if you can get yourself in a position where you can just sit back and watch an entertaining film with an ever-evolving plot, interesting characters and dazzling effects and CGI, then you'll see the film for what it is: a film. It's not the Bible, nor is it a documentary on stories from the Bible. It's a film. Just enjoy it people.",Noah
738,bennorthcott29,Longest Movie I have ever watched,2,17 April 2014,I went to the movie theatre to watch this film and was hugely disappointed. There was mainly unrealistic acting (other than Emma Watson who produced a good performance)and the ending was disappointing. I am atheist and i even think that religious people would find this film pro - religious. The ending was poor as Russell Crowe (Noah) abandoned his beliefs of ending mankind and everyone(all the 'good' characters) lived when there was a huge prospect of a more disappointing ending during the film. My main disappointment though was how slow paced it was. It was a really long film with very little action.

Then came the wizard grandpa who seemingly knew everything and helped Noah with a magic recipe to realize what was coming. Tubal-cain having a chat with Ham among the survivors? The sons of Noah didn't have wives, except for Shem? The neurotic and (lonely???) Noah who wanted to kill his own granddaughters because it had to be done? It's a joke and a shame.

He built an ark to save animals from extinction. Therefore I was excited to see how the writers would captivate the audience with the remaining storyline. Plus with a big budget and Russell Crowe billed as headline act I gave this movie every chance to be a blockbuster. Unfortunately it was far from it. The script tried to engage the audience with elements of romance, action and drama but the final product was inconsistent bordering on ridiculous. The writers attempted to throw in a number of creative elements to the simple build-ark/save-animals plot but it failed dismally. Noah evolves into an obsessive, unsympathetic, murderous character who blames mankind for killing the world. His godly vision gave him meaning to cleanse the world from nasty humans (including his 10 minute old grandchildren) and allow only the innocent to survive being the animals. Then you have subplots of token villain and world destroyer Tubel-cain managing to stow away in the ark. He then commences to eat ark animals whilst plotting to kill Noah with Noah's son mind you, who wants revenge against his father because he missed out on a piece of ass. Then throw in some rock creatures from the set of transformers and you get this; a silly, plot hole ridden waste of investor coin.The acting was average. Even Rusty and Jennifer Connelly delivered pedestrian performances that were irritating at times. Although an honourable mention goes to Emma Watson for her engaging and believable portrayal of the Ila character.The CGI was amateur. I thought I was watching a scene from Anaconda when I saw the snakes slivering towards the ark. None of it was even remotely lifelike which added to the attention tune-out session.I have unavoidably witnessed this movie 3 times and can say it does get slightly less nauseating the more you watch it. Probably because after each time your expectations are lowered. You start appreciating the complexity of the person whois Noah although Emma Watson's performance just gets better and better.

But when they brought in the watchers (Looked extremely cool) and then introduced them as the fallen angels who ""helped mankind"" and now helped Noah it went overboard. Instead, they were part of the reason for God bringing the flood. So now the movie turns them into good? That is changing scripture. Changing what the bible said.2. Noah seemed good and everything. but again things were changed in a huge way. He was looking for answers from God, seeming as if he did not really have contact with God. This again contradicts what the bible said. Secondly later on he kills many people when the water starts coming. And it all ends with him seeming to be the bad guy and wanting to kill the babies of is son? (Now he seems cruel, insane and lost in a cult or something) This never happened.Also all the sons had wives according to the bible. In here it caused problems between him and his one son?

758,erdonnelly67,One WTF moment after another.,2,24 July 2014,"Okay, let me start off by stating I am in fact, a preacher's daughter. Now I was raised with a Christian background, and grew up listening to my family speak about these stories as told in the Bible. I am not what one would call a Bible thumper, I have a mind and do not by into what is always told to me by people, that being said... I must say, this movie has to be one of the most idiotic and blasphemous things I have ever watched. I am pretty sure there were no ""scaled"" dogs before the flood, I am certain there were no ""magic"" glowing rocks that helped the people living then create what we would call a gun in todays day and age... and I am damn sure there were no twisted, deformed ""rock"" angels that talked. It is a shame that Hollywood had the makings of an epic movie, but decided to twist the story so much, that anyone who did not have a clue (or a brain) would even think this to be truth. Hollywood needs to stop twisting these stories and do something good with them. I can see giving them a bit of lead way to help make it something people would want to watch, and filling the time up... but let's not go all willy nilly and do something that is such a slap in the face, that it gets them reviews... of the worst kind. I thought they were in the business to make money, not upset people... even a few atheists have said this was a joke of a movie. And to think that Russell Crow, Jennifer Connelly and Anthony Hopkins allowed themselves to be a part of such a God awful movie amazes me. Surely they are not so hard up for money and to get their names out there they didn't seriously stop to ask themselves that even if they do not believe in God, what if He did exist... I mean do they really want to face the One who created them and explain this movie to Him? I don't think saying I needed to pay for the condo in Reno will quite fly as a explanation... for those of you who will no doubt add a lovely flame to that statement... call me what you will, go on, do your worse. But personally, I think that everyone who says they don't believe in Him, have had a moment, even if it was brief or in a drunken stupor, and have wondered if maybe, just maybe... He does in fact exist. All I can say is those in Hollywood who continue to put this drivel out and do not take care about that thought, should seriously stop trying to ram their BS down my throat. You don't care for the Christian and their point of view, you think us stupid for our belief, I say I find you lack of belief to be more than a bit disturbing, and your take on a pretty awesome story to be offensive. Oh, by the way... I got through about 30 minutes of this before turning it off and just taking a moment to try to digest what I had just attempted to watch.",Noah

To me the story of Noah and the Ark is, like many, if not all, ""stories"" in the bible, a metaphor. Jesus the Christ used parables to illustrate and help educate his follower's. I do not believe they were all meant to be taken literally...and this movie was most definitely not meant to be taken literally. It is, after all, merely an entertainment at best, and quite entertaining it was. I wasn't looking for a literal rendering of the story of Noah. This is a great movie that is well acted with great actor's and a great deal of ""literary license"" was taken. Then again, what ""stories in the bible aren't?

It's amazing (maybe not) how much vitriol is leveled at any movie, book etc. that is based on a biblical story.

760,eitltd-1,Worst adaptation of a biblical story ever made,1,15 April 2014,"I cannot believe this movie has a rating of 6.5. I gave it a one because that's the lowest you can enter. A zero would be more appropriate. Worst adaptation of a biblical story ever. The only thing thing the screenwriter had correct was that Noah had a wife and 3 sons, there was an Ark built, and there was a flood. The following might be interpreted as a spoiler, and that is why I checked the box, but honestly, nothing could spoil this movie, it is already a rotting corpse. You have rock people (possibly fallen angels, but it is not really clear) helping Noah build the ark and defend the ark. Nowhere does God ever talk to Noah. He just has some weird dreams that he misinterprets as being from God. One of these misinterpretations is that God wants everyone dead, even his own family. Then I am trying to figure out how Noah is going to build a rowboat, much less an Ark, because the whole world is desolate, having been ravaged by evil men. Then enters grandpa Methuselah with a magic bean left over from the Garden of Eden. Are you serious? Wait, it gets worse. This magic bean doesn't need overnight to grow, you get a whole old-growth forest in less than a minute. No water required because it creates its own river. As if it couldn't get any worse you have the villain who killed Noah's father who hacks his way through the wall of the Ark to become a stowaway. You have a raging flood and some guy hacks through the Ark, and the Ark takes on no water. Maybe, they were magic self-sealing timbers. Anyway, Noah's son and the stowaway are hiding down with the animals, eating the animals! Later he plots with Noah's son to murder him, while at the same time Noah is plotting to kill his grandchildren. If they had put any of this crazy stuff in the previews, they might not have half the ticket sales. Based on the previews, I thought it could be a good movie. Whoever wrote the screenplay had to be on some kind of drug. For the first time I felt like I should ask for a refund on my ticket.",Noah

Not being a Russell Crowe fan, I thought he did an excellent job. I think all the actors did a very good job. The portrayal of the Watchers was interesting, and I loved their transformation near the end of the movie. This movie caused me to pause, think, and pray for mankind. (I wouldn't have bothered posting this review, but there are a lot of people rating this movie poorly, and I felt compelled to add my vote of 8 out of 10 when there is so much other drivel being produced from Hollywood. I find the people who do not like this movie to be hung up that it doesn't match the real biblical account or they would rather see movies like JackAss.

I was pleasantly surprised that the technology was mostly effective in moving the story forward, e.g., economically depicting the growth of forests which supplied materials for building the ark and animal pairs boarding the ark before the flood. Music and cinematography were great and helped move the story along. The acting was excellent and engaging--it would be easy for sub-par acting to take a film like this off the rails. While the female characters had relatively little to do much of the time, they rose to the occasion in big scenes. Mr. Crowe was terrific as Noah and credibly portrayed extreme changes in the character's personality depicted in this script. Noah is not a great film but it is a thoroughly entertaining re-telling of the myth. It exceeded my expectations.",Noah

This takes a story found in Genesis and pretends to present it, but it completely ignores the details found there and inserts items better found in a Lord of the Rings Movie. As long as we do this I guess the producers figured ""hey, let's take Noah and turn him into a genocidal maniac willing to kill his own family to put an end to humanity.""I know more and more of society consider people with Judeo Christian views are idiots, but don't do a movie like this if you think it's not really true, it insults both of us.",Noah

Do not waste your hard earn money on a film that spits on your intelligence and tells you to like it.Worst movie ever made. The acting sucked. The direction sucked. The CGI was stupidly bad. The entire script was worded as if a kindergarten drop out due to lack of creativity wrote it. None of the characters were likable. Everyone deserved to die. And if I was God I wouldn't have even saved Noah's family. 2 1/2 hours for WHAT? Normally films can tell you something of value. This had no redeeming value and it wasn't even close to entertaining.

As the Director Arnofsky has also mentioned himself ""he had taken artistic liberties"" and it is clear that this is not a traditional bible-inspired movie. It takes some imagination in introducing other modern ideas such as the protection of environment, creation - evolution debate, Noah the prophet as not a morally superior man, and a few less obvious others. I REALLY enjoyed the special effects, the music and the grand scale of the first half of the movie. The only problem I had was the introduction of the ""Evil man Tubal-Cain"" as the main villain, who enter the arch on the side and threatens the whole ""Noah - God chosen clan"". However, I guess that the Director wanted to make the movie somewhat more action-oriented and dramatic, which is not unimaginable. OVERALL, the movie was thought-provoking, interesting, and a welcomed deviation from the usual cut and dry bible stories of Christian inspiration, which in the end, the conclusion of the movie still remains TRUE TO Christian BELIEFS.",Noah

Unfortunately, Darren Aronofsky, who appears to be an Atheist rather than Jewish, has made a SciFi film of Noah...to discredit and mock, or just plain stupidity in trying to visually recreate a true story? I'm not privy to his motives, but with this movie one can only imagine or assume. I have seen some of his other films, and know that he does tend to elaborate while diving deep into the psychological and philosophical corners of the mind, when it comes to visually relaying a story and its characters on screen. And he supposedly consulted with ""Biblical"" Scholars? Debatable. I'm curious to know what denomination they're from...if any.",Noah

Not because I worried about them monkeying with scriptural accuracy (though that played a part) but because the story of Noah does not lend itself to the traditional Hollywood model. How do you shove a square peg into a round hole without shaving off important Biblical truths? Many have tried, all have failed.Fortunately, skepticism gave way to relief as the story unfolded. Aronofsky and Handel managed to accomplish the seemingly impossible - an entertaining version of the Noah story. Was creative license taken? Absolutely. Necessarily so. This is a fun, action-packed, Biblical epic that manages to uphold the important pillars of the Genesis tale. Highly recommended.",Noah

The beginning of the film was effective enough for me to watch and I did in fact watch to the end. Russell Crowe lacked lustre and dare I say it acted more like a judgement prophet than a a man chosen by god. I couldn't understand why Cain's descendant should hide himself away on the ark. The commencement of the flood was spectacular and I do applaud the SFX creators for an effective presentation of the Flood and the Watchers. Ray Winstone was portrayed something of a modern day blacksmith, biblically only slightly near the mark.",Noah
774,the-dreamer-freya,Dire Film,2,2 June 2014,"I was very disappointed with this film. The trailer got me very excited as well as the star cast and director which made the fall even harder. The script was dire, the actors did the best they could given the constraints of the script but it wasn't good enough to rescue the film, all in all a poor show. The reviews I had read were all before its release to the public and showed the film in very good and said it remained close to the biblical story - it did nothing of the sort and for no good reason. For one all of Noah's children had spouses. The arc was not boat shaped on any level, it would not have survived the greatest flood of all floods.Also what was with Noah's arch enemy able to climb up the scaffolding and get inside the arc with all his injuries, and then slowly eating the creatures?The special effects were nothing to shout home about, the animals were just ridiculous marching on the ark the way they did. But I did think when they heard the people screaming and being tossed about the rocks that was pretty effective. They Hollywoodised this film by trying to cram in too many different themes and so the real story was lost, not that it was really about the Biblical Story Noah. There was little mercy from God, or Noah. Noah started off to be a good man and then God corrupted him when he started building the ark, it didn't make sense. God spoke to Noah, Noah was tormented but his care for creation was paramount so did as God asked. The family did not appear very righteous and good to be the leaders of the new world that was devoid of any sin and corruption.I think the real message behind this film was to make out that Noah was bat crazy. It was a con. We were very tempted to leave the cinema, but sat through it in the hope that in some small way it might redeem itself - it didn't.",Noah
775,shujaat-husein,A lame movie,3,6 August 2014,"Nice effects. But even Hollywood's ensemble cast could not gloss over the absurdity of the basic story. The fallen angels were depicted in a typical sci-fi fashion. I wonder how can 21st century people relate to this story! It only has a historic importance dating from the infantile period of human history, not that humans have progressed much in terms of psychological evolution. At best this fairy tale is suitable for minors to teach them a lesson. Yes! the story has a lesson of course. Amor Vincit omnia!

776,vincent-carsel,Often feel stilted and confused,2,4 April 2015,"Noah did personally fall very short though, and actually the little relation to the Bible no matter how people carp on about it is the least of its problems. Douglas Booth is rather bland and too pretty-boy-model-like while Logan Lerman came across as wooden and forced, Ham could easily have been the character we related to but for that to happen I think the film could have expanded much more on his character arc and situation. Ray Winstone is the most disappointing, he's done some great performances but this is not one of them, he is saddled with a very clichéd villain role that has no development to him and he overdoes it in a way that feels straight out of another film entirely. The characters generally are underdeveloped, especially the villain and Ham's subplot had potential to be expanded much more but Ila's character has a lot of heart and effort is made to humanise Noah although some of his decision making comes across as rather sudden. The special effects are a mixed bag, the flood effects are outstanding and the built-to- scale ark also looks incredible, both of which with much grandeur. But the Rock Monsters(or the Watchers) have a dated look, are written in a way that feels irrelevant to the story or in a way that doesn't gel with everything else going on and slightly like Transformers clones, and some of the animals(notably the snakes) look like computerised toys that don't blend within the scenery very well. The dialogue does often feel stilted and confused, especially in the first act, while taking an overwrought if well-intentioned turn in the last and coming across as a little heavy-handed in places. The story does have a number of bright spots and contains some powerful messaging, but does drag a fair bit and has some stuff that felt like filler, the film easily could have been half-an-hour shorter. The story is also a bit of a weird one, and one that leaves more questions than answers, in a sense that it does feel like it doesn't quite know what it wants to be, there's some sci-fi, some action-epic and some character-driven study(which takes up the last act), all three of which with uneven results. The ending is for my liking a bit too convenient as well. Aronofsky's direction is broad and is at home with the style of the film and the spectacle but he fails to make the story properly engage(which is unusual for Aronofsky). Overall, ambitious but uneven. Noah is nowhere near as bad as a lot of the negative reviews have said and the stick it gets for not being close to the Bible is on the unfair side- in all fairness though Noah was advertised in a way that was suggestive that it was an adaptation of the biblical story when really it is the bare bones- but it does have a lot of flaws and could have been better considering how much talent was on board. 5/10",Noah
777,kii-belling1,Solid film but not Aronofsky's finest work,7,7 April 2014,"THE BRIEF: Having seen and really liked a few Darren Aronofsky films I was eagerly anticipating this one. I liked the cast, the general idea and pretty much everything about this film on paper.THE GOOD: The movie is (as you would expect) very epic. The scope is really felt and the world feels lived in. All performances are great which in turn makes the characters at the very least, memorable. The special effects are also great which is crucial in a film like this. Towards the beginning of the 3rd act, Noah tells his children the story of creation, and what ensues is one of the most amazing sequences in film.THE BAD: The conflict between the two groups of humans was underplayed. Their camp is underdeveloped and consequently underused which makes their inevitable attempt to board the arc, impressive, but it lacks the audience connection. The third act of the film is a good idea but it drags on and could have had about 10-20 minutes shaved off.THE MIXED: The actual character of Noah is a mixed bag in this film. He isn't portrayed as a grand savior that is salvaging mankind, rather a mere human who's limits are tested by the immense burden put on him. I liked this idea but in execution it just made for a character that wasn't fun to watch because he was such a dick at times.THE SUMMARY: While this movie isn't bad it makes a few mistakes for sure. I think Aronofsky is better suited to smaller, art-house films, as opposed to big budget blockbusters. There's definitely an interesting story to be found in this film though.7/10",Noah
778,SunDre,Spoiler Alert: This is one completely inaccurate movie!,1,25 September 2014,"I went to this movie with an open mind, and it started out just fine, but then got completely weird very quickly. First off, fallen rock angels? Really? This turned into a sci-fi movie, which was NEVER done with a film on a religious topic. Also, just because it has never been done, does not mean someone should be edgy and try it out. Second, Noah the psycho? That is where I personally drew the line on this film. This is not because of my religious beliefs, but because the director purposely intended to demoralize a character with strong religious conviction. This is not an accurate story telling of Noah, and it sadly has nothing to do with the Biblical story. Now you might say that I am just dumb or stuck-up because I am Catholic, but I would react the same way if some director decided to put flying monkeys in a movie adaptation of Pride & Prejudice. The story telling is lacking, and for those curious how inaccurate, just read King James version of the Bible; Genesis Chapters 6-9. Sadly, this seems more of way for Hollywood to insult and devalue a religion (that is followed my millions around the globe), than an attempt to bring something genuine to the theaters.",Noah
779,AlexD-412-407746,Noah No 10 Commandments,4,7 April 2014,"This review comes from a biblical Christian point of view since I am a follower of Christ. I believe Aronofsky was respectful of the biblical narrative and merely had used artistic liberty in creating his movie. Noah seemed to be presented from a Mosaic Covenant point of view. An easy mistake to make since Genesis is in the Old Testament and is part of the Mosaic Pentateuch. However, God's relationship with mankind in Genesis was not based upon the law, but grace. Aronofsky presents his story from a natural point of view. He sees God as angry with the world, but that is not what the Bible says. Gen 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. It was grief, not anger, that moved God to destroy the world. I think Aronofsky made a valiant attempt to craft his story around what he understood of the Genesis narrative, and made the movie with an assumption of truth to the story, for which he should be commended, even though he made many serious errors in the story. The movie deserves to have its good points stated first. First, the Ark. Aronofsky made it as described in the Bible: a 3 story structure the size of a football field. Second, the animals slept. Creation science agrees with this. Third, he showed the fountains of the deep (Gen. 7:11) erupting, and the rainfall. Fourth, he showed a global flood with a shot of the planet from space. Fifth, he showed the planet as having one large gigantic continent which agrees with plate tectonics and the Genesis account of creation: (Gen 1:9) And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.Sixth, when Noah tells the story of the fall of Adam and Eve, he has the two of them as covered in light until they ate the forbidden fruit. The Bible does not say that they were covered in light, but it is plausible to me, hence the difference when they realized they were naked. Seventh, he has Methuselah die when the flood comes. The Bible does not say that the Flood caused his death, however, that is a small point of artistic liberty that is allowable. Eighth, Aronofsky made Ham a weak link in the story, and I thought that was a good choice. Historically, it was the descendants of Ham that created all the major ancient civilizations after the Flood. However Cham is the Hebrew for ""hot"" and I think Ham that should have been more of a ""hot head."" Now the flaws of the movie. First, Noah's sons had wives that went into the ark with them, whereas the movie had one. (Gen 6:18) ... and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. Second, it is unlikely that Tubal-cain was still alive. Methuselah lived to be 969 years, but no mention of Tubal-cain's death is given. His birth was near the time of Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve, which would make him around 1,400 years old! Third, the main evil that grieved God's heart is presented as ecological destruction which is just too politically correct. Fourth was the introduction of the Watchers, which is non-biblical. I think I understand his logic for putting them in, though. They are shown helping Noah build the Ark, which makes them a convenient substitute construction equipment. He may have been alluding to the giants from the sons of God (Gen 6:4), but he made them to be angels that became earth bound. Fifth, when Noah tells the creation story in the Ark, the visuals are very fast, but you can see he planned the images to fit the flow of evolutionary thinking.And now for the major flaw, which is the heart of Aronofsky's story, but not the Bible. Noah is presented has having a weak relationship with God, only understanding God through mystical visions, and having a legalistic attitude regarding righteousness. Righteousness is not the law, but love. Righteousness means ""that which is right"". Love does prevail in the end to Aronofsky's credit, but Noah is shown to be murderous towards humans and only cherishing animal life, which, again is too politically correct. It is believed by theologians that when God says: (Gen 6:3) And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.That is how long it took to build the Ark. During that time, Noah warned the world of the impending doom. Peter said, (2 Pe 2:5) And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;In the movie, Noah is depicted hating the evil of everyone, including himself and his family. No one walks with God who is filled with hate. Jesus was a friend to sinners, and Noah would have been a man filled with compassion for others and his family. So the climax of the film with Noah willing to murder the two daughters was grievous to watch. Not to mention, stupid. If Noah really believed that no one in mankind should live, including himself and his family, then why not stay outside the Ark with the rest of the world and drown? Or why not kill all his family, stay on the Ark to help the animals get out, then commit suicide? For this reason, the movie failed. I doubt if the movie will join the 10 Commandments as part of any Christian library.",Noah

Do you see where I'm going with this? God is depicted as lunatic!Dear director, if you hated the story so much why did you take it in the first place and ruined the truth of the bible just to make what it really is not?However, there is one thing I learned from this experience. Don't get your hopes up, anything Biblical will be used to depict God as egotistical maniac and His servants as schizophrenic idiots, just for the sake of defending humanistic and socially acceptable view of God.This is exactly what this movie accomplished.",Noah
781,Hardcore94,Excellent 10,10,29 March 2014,"Ingeniously made, this movie represents an essence of the story from ""Old Testament"" talking about Noah and flood of the Earth. 1. Drama: 10/10. There are a lot of very stressful and touching scenes, that are not brutal but are made to tell you some deep messages and give an explanation of some things while affecting you psychologically in positive way.2. Acting: 9/10. Some actors including Crowe, Watson, Lerman, Hopkins and Winstone were excellent while others failed to impress me.3. Story: 10/10. Story is essentially credible to the one from ""Old Testament"", excluding details. Literary arts could not be compared to the film arts, therefore movie cannot and shouldn't fully represent the original written piece by all means, in this case especially because stories from Bible always need to be elucidated and interpreted. Otherwise we would have naive and boring movie.4. Plot and Denouement: Both scored 10/10. The beginning, elaboration (middle) and the ending are all perfectly and very richly made. Why? Too much to explain, you will need to watch the movie to find out (and conclude by yourself)5. Graphics/CGI/Movie effects: 10/10 for this movie's purpose whose main aim is story. It is more than enough for this movie, furthermore it is better than some movies that were supposed to have awesome effects and it just shows how well producers have done their job.6. Sound: 10/10. Adds more tension ""ergo"" does its job.7. Watcher - Movie relations: 10/10. I was very emotionally touched by many scenes and a got excited so many times that it is impossible to count them. I was integrated in the movie and had feeling like i was the part of the story. That's very hard to achieve.8. Who should watch it: This movie IS for clever religious people and everyone who is ready and clever enough to believe in greater stuff than current science and things that they can directly see and prove.My Conclusion: This movie deserves nothing less than mark ""10"" and also deserves to be nominated for next ""Academy Awards"" in a few categories and also to win a few of them. I hope this director, writers, and cinematographer and some actors will film more stories from ""Old Testament"". They are just perfect team for that! To them: Thank You for such a wonderful movie that made my day and opened my eyes in some way!",Noah
782,nerd-470-402612,Ugh!,1,21 September 2014,"When I first saw ""the watchers"" in the film, I admit I had to start laughing. They reminded me of the rock monster in the comedy film, ""Galaxy Quest."" While I'm not now a Judeo-Christian, I was raised as a Methodist. And while the watchers are mentioned in some apocryphal (ie., non-canonical) Jewish texts, there is no physical description of them. Enter Hollywood (sigh).Anyway, I've always thought of the Noah story as a bit too fanciful to be true. As I understand it, the continental shift that landlocked Australia from the rest of the world was already in place. Even if, by some miracle, God created a landbridge between Australia and the land of Noah, two kangaroos would have had to hop mighty fast to reach him. And koalas (who sleep between 18-22 hours every day) would have to be strung out on methamphetamines to make the same journey in a timely manner.My favorite high-fantasy film remains Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments."" ""Noah"" doesn't even come close to being as good.",Noah

The acting was good,I mean,Russell Crowe,a great actor,the scenery was a bit dreary. who ever wrote this movie was smoking something,The only thing missing was Doors music or tangerine dream for the soundtrack....very strange movie",Noah

I knew that other than the names of the main characters and the premise of a flood that this was going to be a violent departure from the source material. What I wasn't prepared for was a movie with such big-name stars that would be so utterly bad in so many ways. For example, a core element of the last part of the movie was completely unintelligible, as Noah is bent on a course of action for which the rationale seems more a mental disorder than anything actually in keeping with the narrative (at least not without running the risk of injuring oneself by reaching so far to grasp at straws). Save yourself 2+ hours.",Noah

I am not a catholic or a Christian and I am not familiar with the original story, that being said, movies are pieces of fiction and are made for entertainment... I thought the visuals of this movie were magnificent, I thought it was a cool story of an ancient time where a world's creator communicated with its creation... Why not take this movie for what it is... a movie! and not take it to heart, in no way shape or form has Hollywood ever vowed to make movies 100% accurate to the written content that movies are based on... see that word... based... which means not actually... In a nutshell this is a very entertaining movie with a very human message, we are not perfect, we make mistakes and we can redeem ourselves at the end... I think that is a very positive message and fairly accurate to what we humans are... the graphics are amazing and the movie feels very epic in the ranks of lord of the rings... definitely worth the trip to the theater if not for the visuals alone!",Noah
786,deathdealersteve,"Masterpiece - Just as misunderstood as ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Only God Forgives""",10,30 March 2014,"95% of the people hating this movie are cashing in for the attention of their self generated controversy and the other 5% are just too close to the Bible to want things change up to much, which there's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't mean this is a bad movie. The performances from everyone are stellar, Russel Crowe exceeds the depth that Charlton Heston ever went into in his famous biblical epic performances and this film is equal parts biblical epic and intense drama. Jennifer Connelly is just as powerful and Ray Winstone steals the show with his Apocalypse Now Col. Kurtz powerful monologue on ""The Greatness of Man"". The visual effects are the most complex I have ever seen but Darren Aronofsky, famous for his character studies never cheapens the experience by over extending his money shots. Aronofsky is in total control and we are in safe hands. The arc of the story is very moving and those complaining about the twists or the supposed anti-religious tone of the film should watch this great movie again and take notice of the vision Noah had of himself in the mob of evil men and how absolutely terrified he is. This movie is brave enough to take on heavy moral struggles for it's protagonist handled tenderly and skillfully by Russel Crowe, he is not enraged when he finds out Ila is pregnant, he is gripped in SORROW. The tweaking of the angels from how they are in The Bible was necessary for the story to progress just because of logistical reality and adds a touching warmth to their history as well, ya'll should also know that the angels were voiced by Nick Nolte and Frank Langella, and they did a wonderful job. Once again as happened to ""The Lone Ranger"", all the critic pricks had their reviews in before the movie was even out, people should just ignore critics anyway and the common audiences were just as shocked by the depth, style and auteur craftsmanship that Aronofsky did as Nicolas Winding Refn did in ""Only God Forgives"", another misunderstood masterpiece. Those expecting Aronofsky to conform to Hollywood superficial film-making were in for a shock, and if they weren't too stuck up, a pleasant surprise and a breath of fresh air like stepping out of an ark after being in there quite a while.",Noah
787,kwnstantinak_96,"A very confusing plot, but extremely memorable performances.",6,20 September 2014,"When I first went to watch the movie ""Noe"", I was just expecting another version of the well-known story. I am not pleased to say that I was very much surprised. At least the surprise kept me from getting bored eventually.The film was interesting indeed, but for all the wrong reasons. From the very beginning the story and the way it was depicted in the film was very confusing. I found many alterations to the Biblical tale that did not fit well and that were very misleading to the actual plot. On the one hand, I found that the film tried to show the world as it was most likely to have been at time, but, on the other hand, it shows men possessing technology simply impossible to have existed back then and implied that there existed magical creatures such as giant rock monsters and Mathusala as a man who possesses magic. The controversy continues with Noah himself, shown as a man chosen by the Creator for his pure heart to save nature and mankind, yet Noah never refrains from killing or abandoning people. However, I must say that all the performances of the actors where simply breathtaking. Of course, I wouldn't have expected anything less from Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone and Anthony Hopkins. But I never knew how capable an actress Emma Watson actually is (the highlight of this film I might say) or how faithfully Logan Lerman can perform. Although the film was a disappointment for me, at least it kept me awake through the whole film and left me praising the casting directors.",Noah
788,hwasif33,One time watchable,5,4 April 2014,"In an age where Hollywood tentpoles have become maddeningly generic and redundant, that a movie as imaginative and earnest as 'Noah' would be booed by the public is downright depressing.This is not a literal interpretation, but part of the genius of the bible is that stories in it can be reanalyzed for all time. I'm also mystified by those who claim it lacks emotion or feeling. I was deeply moved throughout; the animals quietly heading toward the Ark was both heartrending and thrilling.You will enjoy it if you go for entertainment's sake and/or the thought-provoking elements the movie provides.",Noah

I expected this movie to be an attempt to make a new and edgy adaptation of the biblical story of Noah that reflects current social conflicts. Its not that. Its just a CGI action movie with all the standard trappings and devices you expect in a recent-vintage CGI action movie. Nothing more. This movie is so typical I was embarrassed for the director. Noah has been reduced to just another GI Joe Ninja Fighter. Further, the premises are ridiculous and the continuity is highly-questionable. Supposedly Cain's descendants created an ""industrial"" (The movie's word)civilization and ravaged the earth. The landscapes are utterly barren. Then suddenly when its time to board the Ark, there are millions of creatures. No explanation. There are a few attempts at insight, but these have very little relevance to the Bible story.

To me the movie could've been great but it was just really weird to me for the most part, and left me with a lot more questions than answers.There was plenty of drama, but most of it just seemed extremely unnecessary. The one good thing about this movie is that it showed just how dangerous religion has proved to be throughout it's history. People have always given themselves the power to do whatever they think god wants whether it makes any sense or not, because whether there is a god or not who knows, but what I do know is that nobody has any more idea than I do what god might or might not want, so to consider doing the unthinkable like murdering your two beautiful innocent newborn twin granddaughters for no good reason might be something you might like to reconsider just in case you might be wrong.

792,crizrocks,Decent adaptation of the greatest bible Disaster.,7,1 April 2014,"Darren Aronofsky was one director who never disappointed me. From Pi till Black Swan, every one of his films were brilliant and mind blowing. But Noah was not up to the high hopes which i had. But to say i guess he did a better job at adapting the story into a movie than what's told in Bible even though not all accurate as given in the Bible. The visuals are really up to expectations. The movie almost feels like another version of Aronofsky's The Fountain. Many features of the film are totally imaginary, like the fallen angels becoming rock giants, them helping Noah build his ark and once done, them taken back to the creator and the other humans trying to take over the ark, also son of Cain trying to tame Ham all are writer's creation to add to dramatization of the story but are all making the movie look pretty lame. Clint Mansell's music also is the same from The Fountain which again adds to the repetitive feel along with the tag-line, ""End is only the beginning"" while that of Fountain was ""Death is the road to awe"". So, Noah by Aronofsky is not worth the money and time spend, but again is worth a shot at.",Noah
793,BadgeMcVid,Its only entertainment,7,20 November 2014,"I went to see Noah not knowing what to expect,my overall feeling after leaving the cinema was that i had enjoyed a good movie. It wasn't great but its definitely not as bad as some folk are saying. If you want to be entertained and to see a good spectacle its worth having a peek. Don't go if your expecting a biblical essay on Genesis 5:32-10:1 or if you take your films too seriously. Its a sort of biblical ""Braveheart"", entertaining and not in any way an accurate portrayal of the real story. For example the fallen angels turned into stone are something even a pure atheist would agree on is pure Hollywood having not read a word of the oldest story. They reminded me very much of the Ent's scenes in the Lord of the Rings, a wee bit Plagiarism going on but who cares-they were perhaps some of the best scenes in the film pre-flood. Russell Crowe is always watchable, maybe not at his best but he didn't look bad for a guy who was supposed to be over 500 years old.",Noah
794,andrei_balint92,Just horrible,3,16 December 2014,"I will start my review by stating that I did not consider it horrible just because it distanced itself from the bible.Noah is inspired from the religious story of the flood. That does not mean that it has to stick to the original story and can have its own original interpretation of the story. It actually does that reaching toward a sort-of sci-fi universe. But all in all its interpretation makes me flood the world again...Why ? Well lets just analyze the plot a bit : it seems that Adam and eve had 3 sons ( Cain , Abel , Seth ) and after Cain killed Abel Seth ran and made is own civilization which was at war with Cain's sons . Cains sons kinda won and Seth's people almost went extinct except for Noah and his family. After they won the earth Cain's sons created an industrial empire and polluted the earth until it could not sustain life. God was kinda angry with that and decided to flood the world so he could begin anew and only Noah and his family who were still fateful would survive with his help. So he told Noah what was bound to happen and instructed him to build an ark to house well every pair of animals and his family . Later in the movie we find out that he will build the ark with the help of angel-stone-giants .... Yup you heard me angel-stone-giants.. ( Fallen angels who were turned into stone giants by gods wrath ) and his grandfather Mathusalem would is just there for no reason actually. After he finishes the ark he decides that humanity is corrupt as a species and decides kill even his family taking the role of judge , jury and executioner. But in the end he snaps out of it and lives the rest of his life as naked old drunk man.This movies bad , just bad the philosophy behind it is stupid , the messages it sends are inconsistent , the graphics are bad , the characters make no sense and the realism is dead .The philosophy behind it.The messages it is trying to send are the following : ""unsustainable growth is bad because it kills the world around you "" , "" instincts are present in all of us no matter how pure we are "" and ,"" man has the urge to impose his view on the whole world "".So how does this movie underline these aspects ?The first one is just there and the director says "" DEAL WITH IT "" it offers no history no argumentation why the world ended up a bloody nuclear fallout . It just happened because people mined and killed . Seriously no argumentation ? No history ? Nothing .The second one is underlined through the needs of Noahs sons who want to live a normal life like Noah did. One of them wants a woman with him on the ark and even risks his life to get one . So lets overview this you have a guy who is faced by the ultimate end of the human race .. delivered through a flood by a supernatural being and he believes that his priority now is finding a woman . Seriously ??? That is damn right stupid .. Pray to the lord for one because if he can flood the world and create stone-giants I'm pretty sure he can give you a woman if he so desires and if he doesn't he will just kill the one you find....The last one is just retarded and underlined through Noah's actions who after seeing a vision thinks that the human race is corrupt by definition. So he sets out to kill his sons girlfriend with her unborn baby.. after the woman was made fertile by a miracle by god. Are sure it's that the way you want to present your statement ? You take the guy who is busy trying to save the world and turn him into the guy who saves the world and then wants to kill while saving it ? That is down-right stupid and contradicting in itself.Now about the character ... This movies has poorly defined and stereotypical character and even useless ones . The stone giants : useless The bad guys : totally undefined just bad by definition Noahs sons : kinda play a part in the movie but you get the feeling they are just there to look nice Matusalem : Random oracle of Delphi which dies gathering berries while the flood is coming Noah pr-madness : believes in purity and salvation and redemption and considers that lord will is supreme and that morality still has a place in the human heart Noah Post-madness-Disregards the lord and his sign , considers humanity hopeless and believes there is no salvation while saving everybody. God : Kinda there and not there does random things really So in the end the movies is bad , the characters are bad , the graphics are bad and you would have had a better time sitting at home watching "" home alone ""for the 10'th time . This movies is flooded by inconsistency and randomness",Noah

I could go on about the problems with acting, script, goofy rock monsters, etc. but my main problem with the movie is that it's just so... boring. and depressing. So many different things happen throughout the film, but I couldn't help being completely bored. Even the action scenes were boringly executed, my friend even fell asleep during the battle for the arc! But nothing was as bad as when they finally got to the arc. Without spoiling anything, Noah turns into an a- hole, everything sucks for everyone, and all of the confrontation feels pointless. By the end, I couldn't wait to get out of the film.

I won't go into the details to avoid any spoilers, but the movie left me with the feeling of being sad about who we are and also how it interpreted God. I realize God in the old testament is someone you really don't want to disappoint and the God of the new testament is all about love and forgiveness. However the God of this movie is kind of spiteful.if you are a Christian/Jewish/Muslim watching this movie, its kind of insulting.Come to think of it, if you are an atheist watching it,, its also insulting.",Noah
798,iamlush777,I had Noah-dea I'd like it this much.,8,5 April 2014,"""Noah"" is about a man with a hell of a lot of responsibility. Adapted from the renowned biblical texts, adventurous director Darren Aranofsky floods our senses with the audiovisual experience of climactic grandeur that only he can portray. Half a cinema was present in sharing the first showing of ""Noah"" in my area, indicating the controversy and cast grabbed a lot of attention. From what I've read Aranofsky has stayed quite true to the source material story-wise though with only some minor changes to keep things exciting (an altered story arc for Ham for example); which in my opinion were very worthwhile. After a run through of the book of Genesis (Creation, temptation in the Garden of Eden, Cain murdering Abel and the watchers leaving heaven to help on earth) we meet a young Noah who flees after witnessing the murder of his father by Cain's selfish descendants. Noah, himself a descendant of Adam and Eve's third son Seth, is now a father of 3 who respects the Creator's work enormously. ""We only take what we need"" he says as his son picks a flower for its aesthetics alone. Suddenly, a single rain drop hits the ground and a flower springs up instantly, of course this must be a sign from God so Noah decides to take his family to seek advice from his Grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins). En route, they find an injured orphan named Ila among the remains of a massacre and out of love take her with them as they flee into an blackened wasteland from a mob of warriors approaching quickly. Noah is later stricken with several haunting and beautifully represented dreams where he is suspended underwater above the drowned human race, he decides to build an ark to save the good of the world from the flood that could end it. Russell Crowe, like most of the other performances, is solid and believable as Noah but not outstanding; his somber voice really hitting home some profound anecdotes and memorable lines. As the audience we are able to watch him slowly change his outlook and reflect on his own way of life which held my interest. Jennifer Connelly as Noah's wife is largely expressionless but then has an emotionally charged speech later on that makes up for it. Ray Winstone as the king of Men is brilliantly creepy and comical however his surprisingly timid sword forging and some other minor quips (London accent etc.) broke the spell now and again if only for an instant. Emma Watson was a real gem, but maybe I only say that because I'm madly in love with her. The Watchers though... If it is in the source material that the fallen angels really did meld with rock then Aronofsky's interpretation is pretty darn awesome. Imagine the offspring of a mech from the Matrix sequels and an Onyx and you have an Ark-building, human-stomping Watcher. The film is always visually stunning with multiple epic set pieces in and around the monumental Ark such as the influx of different creatures by air and land. The story of man's destructive downward spiral into hatred from their humble beginnings as single celled life- forms and even earlier is also gracefully interpreted. Scenes post-flood in my opinion look gorgeous, similar to the groundbreaking visuals in certain ""Life of Pi"" scenes. What I love about Aronofsky's films in particular is how he usually builds to a climax. Previously his films have built to a huge crescendo and then just end, such as the final fight in ""The Wrestler"" or performance in ""Black Swan"", aided by a tantalizing score that pushes you steadily to the edge of your seat. In Noah, there are multiple critical climaxes which though not quite as impactful still mesmerise and entertain. Overall, ""Noah"" is a great film not without the refined editing, music and style we've come to expect from this director's work. Though likely heavily restrained by the production company's fear of offending, the film's over-arching themes of respect for the earth and largely encapsulating visuals (apart from a couple of painfully rendered green- screen scenes) make up for times where I thought the screen writing was a little too safe. Thoroughly enjoyable and I learnt a thing or two, 7.5/10 from me.",Noah
799,theduddlers,Overall it was an insanely epic movie,10,5 April 2014,"So I just got home from watching the Noah premiere in Sweden and I had been waiting for this movie for a long, long time. I was definitely not disappointed with this movie. It started out a bit slow but it was a really good build-up and it was pretty much really necessary for it to have a slow build-up. Now something that shocked me was how dark and depressing this movie was. It was felt with a lot of moments where I felt sickened by watching it, and when a movie brings out emotions like that I can instantly say that the movie is worth seeing. The acting in this movie is fantastic! Logan Lerman really shone all the way through. A completely amazing performance from his side. Russell portrayed Noah pretty good, I can't really see anyone do it better and he had a lot of great moments towards the end. Jennifer Connelly was great! One of her better performances in my opinion. The reason I started gaining interest in this movie was because of Emma Watson and I have to say she blew me away, she's never been this good in a movie. However some of her expressions felt rather forced, but I can't really blame her, it was a really tough role to portray, but now I will complain... Douglas Booth! You are horrible. Honestly, it could be one of the worst performances I've seen in a long time. I could see on him that he had no interest in what was going on through the entire movie. Every scene he was in, he completely ruined. I won't spoil anything but there was a really powerful scene at the end and then he came and ruined it completely. I was almost crying and then he came, and I almost started laughing at how bad he was. You could think with the budget they've spent they could get someone a bit better... Good thing though, he wasn't in it as much as Logan.Now I've read a lot on here about complains about the rock monsters. Which is definitely understandable, I got surprised when I saw them. But for the entire time that I watched it, I didn't think of it as a biblical story, I found it really cool and unique of Darren Aronofsky to put in his own things into it, and I think the rock monsters (or as they're called ""watchers"") had a really good purpose and played a good part in the story. As for the story then... I really liked it. The story is powerful enough only reading it in the bible but when you go this deep into it and expand it, it was a totally different thing. Very powerful and epic all the way through and I was hooked through the entire movie. It had a lot of unexpected turns which I really enjoyed and I have an urge to read this segment from the bible now.So for a conclusion I will say this: The directing was great, acting was great (except for Douglas Booth, geez), soundtrack was amazing, cinematography was brilliant, visual effects was really good and the fact that they built that ark for real still shocks me. I recommend this movie to everyone, it was exciting and really dark. I felt depressed when it was over but it was such an epic film and it really hooked me. Fantastic movie! One of my all time favorites!10/10",Noah
800,mayel714,This director should stick to drug addiction movies,3,2 April 2014,"I am glad I saw this movie because it is generally based on Noah from the Christian Bible. This director should have consulted the GOD of Hollywood Mel Gibson. If you want to know how to make an epic Bible film seek Mel Gibson as a consultant the man was genius on Passion of The Christ. For the record Noah had a wife and three sons, all three of his sons had wives that were in the Arc and a male and female of each animal. The director should have read a little more of the Bible to get it right, he did a good job on the movie about drug addicts and it is very obvious this guy has never read the Bible and has the faith of an animal. My favorite part was how he showed that the Bible says that only with a male and female can you be fruitful and multiply. Passion of The Christ grossed almost $612 million with a budget of $30 million. This director D.A. will never see that kind of gross earnings on any of his movies. Call Mel next time.",Noah
801,evanbates90,"A ""Christian"" who actually liked this movie...",8,30 March 2014,"It bothers me that when religious Christians see this movie, all they usually seem to focus on is that the film doesn't ""correctly"" portray the actual story and text. I've heard outrageous complaints raging from, ""an inaccurate setting"" to, ""Noah didn't really do that"". When really, if you're looking for accuracy in this film, just go read the biblical story for yourself and see that it doesn't have much detail to it. Really, it doesn't.Noah's Character didn't have much development in the Bible. It very simply describes him and his family without expounding on their more detailed personality traits, thoughts or actions. Noah was just, and God was gracious to him and his family. Noah did what God told him and then Noah learned how to make wine and got drunk. Concerning him and his family, that's about all we got. If you want a film that sticks to that description, get ready for a fairly boring set of characters, with hardly any personality.For a biblical story like this to be translated into film, you need to venture into a very creative mindset in order to make it and I believe Aronofsky achieved that. The movie has a completely different take on the story that no one else has come close to. And I view that as a positive. Set in an almost dystopian environment with amazing imagery displayed, Noah has a cool look to it's setting.What intrigued me the most about this adaptation was the inner workings of Noah's mind, displayed by Russell Crowe. He goes through an understandable wave of thoughts before, during and after his task is finished, making him more relatable than the Bible gave description for.Plausible events took place in the story, and fantastical events occurred as well. But I don't blame the writers of the film for adding these things, seeing as the original story can be read from a fantasy perspective.One thing that got me confused though was the origin of some larger than life characters that helped Noah in his efforts. It was explained in the film, but given the source of these characters, it needed further explanation for me and left me a bit confused. Along with that is the source from which the characters receive light and fire. There wasn't a description of this substance and again, it left me bewildered.Other than those two things, the movie was good. I didn't even notice it's length which is quite long at about 2.5 hours. I was thoroughly entertained with the story, the characters, the creativity of the movie, and above all the message that was communicated. The performances given by the actors were well done, and I especially noticed how Emma Watson's character Ila was portrayed very well among others.One more thing: This movie is based off of a graphic novel developed by both writers of the film. It is not solely based on the Bible, but also on the creative avenues the writers took. Don't expect a Sunday school retelling of a classic Bible story. And be thankful that it wasn't a C rate movie made with limited imagination, crappy acting and a boring plot. Because generally, that's what you get with Christian films.",Noah
802,dhegelund,Intelligent movie,10,30 March 2014,"I don't understand all the hate that ""Noah"" (the movie) is getting. Personally, I think it is a GREAT movie. But maybe it's because I'm an artist, so I understand what art is and isn't supposed to be. Seems as if a lot of people -especially Christians– thought they were going to see a documentary or a theological disputation. I actually think it sticks very well to the Biblical account. Maybe people don't know their Bible as well as they think they do. --- If you don't like the story, how's that the movie's fault? Fallen angels, giants, genocide, etc. is all in the Bible. --- Yes, I'm talking about the actual Bible, not the version you were taught in Sunday school, when you were five years old. Anyway, if you are at all philosophically inclined and don't mind movies that make you think about serious and even existential questions, ignore the haters; Go see ""Noah""!I haven't been so emotionally moved and intellectually stimulated from a movie for quite a while. It's not for the weak of heart. After all, it's a story about genocide. But it is beautifully made. And, in my opinion, stays true to the Biblical account.",Noah
803,o_imdb-891-670455,"Worst, God-Awful Movie of the Past Decade",1,31 March 2014,"This movie has been in the news due to some controversy. The only real controversy here is that this is the worst, God-awful movie of the decade. Any controversy keeps it in the news and makes people go out and waste their money to see what is the controversy. Many people are walking out on this movie, including myself. It has nothing to do with the biblical Noah. Just a sci-fi fantasy with special effects. Don't waste your money and time. If you really want to see it, wait for the DVD. But word of mouth is going to spread quickly and people are going to see it and then warn others not to bother. It was painful for me to watch it, and the only reason I stayed is because the person with me likes sci-fi and special effects. Otherwise I would have walked out early on this one. What a waste of film money.",Noah
804,soblevins,Profound and moving,8,29 March 2014,"This is definitely NOT the Biblical account of Noah. This is no surprise since Aronofsky himself said that it was the, ""least Biblical movie you'll ever see."" That said, it's a very good movie by almost any measure. The direction, cinematography, script and acting are all solid. The questions it raises resonate with (western, at least) human experience and Christian tradition: How can I be sure of what God is telling me? What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be a man? What does it mean to be faithful to God? What is justice? How do we balance love and justice? These questions are significant and profound. The movie explores these questions in ways that fall well within the teachings of the Old and New Testaments as well as 2,000 years of Christian tradition. And the movie does this with out becoming heavy- handed or preachy. Contrary to secular and religious commentary and critique, I saw no heavy-handed environmentalist messages, no incest, and no wholesale rejection of Biblical morality or a Biblical world-view. The movie is intense (and for young viewers, frightening). But, faithful to the Biblical narrative, it proclaims and celebrates a God who loves his creation - including people! - and who categorically rejects the evil that humans perpetrate upon themselves and others. It takes seriously the reality that, given our own tendency toward sin, it is sometimes difficult to sort out how to be faithful to God and loving to others in the midst of a culture that seems bent on arrogant, self- destruction.",Noah
805,shk1234,This film has nothing to do with Noah,1,10 August 2014,I watched this thinking that it would be in the same vein as 'The Ten Commandments'. It was not. It was nothing like it whatsoever. From start to finish this movie was pure drivel. At the start of the movie we are introduced to the idea of fallen Angels who had disobeyed the Almighty and been sent to live on earth in the form of rock monsters??!! As the movie progresses there is no hiding the dullness. With each passing minute it became more and more ridiculous. For example Anthony Hopkins plays Noah's grandfather and has the ability to perform magic??!! Emma Watson is barren and cannot have children but one touch from Anthony Hopkins changes all that??!!I have the read the story of Noah and this story has absolutely nothing to do with him whatsoever. My suggestion to everyone is don't waste your time.,Noah
806,sgntheone,A confusing...but engaging visual spectacle......!!!,7,30 March 2014,"Noah is a visually compelling and engaging movie. Darren Aronofsky successfully creates an atmosphere of the eternal doom and the rebirth of a new world.I haven't heard or read this story before and so I went with a blank slate, letting Darren paint the entire journey for me. I left the theater confused. Is destruction, really the answer instead of healing ?? Can God really want to purge the entire species which he himself created?? For me the work did not connect at an intellectual level or emotional level. The portrayal of men as complete evil with no hope just did not go down well with me. I did not get a feeling of hope and faith I expected, when the credits rolled at the end which I so desperately wished. When a movie like this ends, you expect goosebumps and a feeling of surreal which makes the entire journey memorable. But the ending was quite a downer.But there is no taking away from the fact that the movie is a visual spectacle. The CGI is mind blowing. The scenes where all the animals enter the arc, the birth of the forests are all images which would stay for you for hours after you have left the theater. But all of these scenes are no match to the final finale when the great floods come. One of the best CGI scenes I have seen this year. All the actors put on a great performance, ably led by Russell Crowe.Overall, a great cinematic experience in terms of bringing alive a story which till now we could only imagine how it could have happened...!!!",Noah
807,aeLLnisba32,Changing the script,8,10 August 2014,"The movie ""Noah 2014,"" was made according to the word and vision of Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel...both Jewish writers. It is through their minds that this particular biblical story of Noah is told. Many stories written in the St. James version of the bible are so fantastic and events so miraculous one must gather together all of ones faith in God if any of the events are to be believed. The story of a man and his family building a floating barge and sheltering animals in it to survive a great flood is not one of those stories...it is totally believable and probably true. Unfortunately, Aronofsky and Handel, over-fabricated events for the enjoyment and entertainment of the moviegoers, and in doing so changed the believability of the film. To have rock-men with glowing eyes help build the great ark was a bit too much to ask of me. I simply did not believe it. Even Anthony Hopkins who plays Noah's grandfather, ""Methuselah,"" manages to become a unbelievable, mythical character. In the bible, Methuselah was a wise man and lived to be 969 years old, according to scripture...but the director changed him into a ""Oddo-like"" character who cowards in the shadows asking for red berries to eat. The momentum of the scenes and story plots were a bit ""slow,"" at times, and movie sets dark and sometimes ""colorless,"" but the direction and editing by Aronofsky was crisp and refreshingly different. I expected to see a warm, compassionate and very religious Noah...but the director showed us that Noah could also be cold and heartless and prone to a drunken state. Russell Crowe, as Noah, did what the directors asked him to do...play a complex, fallible man. In turn, this made the story of Noah more believable, and more life-like, but also a bit unlikable and unnerving. What the audience was expecting was the sanitized, Hollywood version of who Noah was...and what they got probably was the true character of Noah...a religious, but imperfect man.",Noah
808,Ms_White79,**Just Go See It**,8,29 March 2014,"First, let me say that I'm really surprised by some of the reviews. There is a lot of complaining about how inaccurate the movie was. But if you're a MOVIEGOER, then you should understand that this movie was not going to be a play-by-play of the biblical story. I went in with an open mind and was excited to see Aronofsky's take on the story of Noah.In a nutshell, I was pleased. Granted, the physical appearance of The Watchers took a little getting used to. But their presence is explained further into the movie. And let me say this: if you have read about The Book of Enoch, the Nephilim, etc., then you will understand who The Watchers are and the role they play in humanity's story. Also, I loved how the director explained Noah's drunkenness. For the movie, it made sense.Anyway, you had to know that this wouldn't be a humdrum interpretation of the ark story...it's got Russell Crowe and Ray Winstone in it, for goodness sake! So expect some violence and gore...but not exceedingly so. The acting was phenomenal. From Connelly to Crowe to Watson (and everyone in between), you FELT their emotions. The cinematography in this film is beautiful. The telling of the Creation Story by Noah is one ripe with colors, the tempo is quick and helps the viewer to understand the central issue that Noah struggles with. I daresay that Noah's struggle mimics that of religious followers today: interpretations that are too literal.Anyway, I believe in creative expression...and that's what Aronofsky provided us with in this film. If you are a movie buff the way I am, I would encourage you to go see it...and more importantly, go in with an open mind and leave the religious fanaticism at home.",Noah
809,gearheadpatriot,Absolutely Horrible,1,30 March 2014,"There aren't many movies out there that leave the viewer feeling quite so abused. If you're a Christian, and I am, this movie will outright insult you. The directors interpretation of what has become a founding story within the Christian faith, representing so many tenets of our beliefs, is nothing short of appalling. Within the first 30 minutes I had to ask my wife if I'd read the same book because the movie didn't follow, even remotely, the story of Noah. What really agitates me, is that we don't do movies often, but I thought that this would be a faith inspiring movie for the family. Don't make the same mistake I did, this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities.",Noah
810,a-shaw619,Ignore the ridiculous hate,9,30 March 2014,"I find it ridiculous that Christian audiences are so threatened by this movie. Are not all the important elements of the Noah story in the movie? Are the same themes still not present? The story is only a couple chapters long in the Bible anyway and information about what occurred between Noah receiving God's message to the time they get off the ark is sparse. Aronofsky and Handel do a good job filling in the gaps left by the Bible with an interesting, although dark, dramatic story.I do wonder how many of you complaining ever actually read the Old Testament. God was NOT the kind and wonderful God that he's been made out to be by so many of you. It's ridiculous because this movie showed what I believed to be a good portrayal of the extent of the depravity of man that caused God to want to flood the earth in the first place.Tossing the ""controversy"" aside, there was some really solid acting in this movie. Russell was fantastic but Jennifer's star shone the brightest, in my opinion. Logan Lerman, Anthony Hopkins, and Ray Winstone were all good as well and Emma Watson surprised me in certain scenes (although not the birthing scene - yikes). Douglas Booth was severely underused, which is fine since he's was at least pretty.Other cinematic elements such as the cinematography and the score were absolutely spot on (and are further enhanced by watching in IMAX) and worthy of a watch on their own. The CGI was also fantastic, and yes, I include the stone-like Watchers in that as well. I loved how they seemed to look almost like old-school claymation, which made them more interesting for me.The film was very brutal and violent at times and almost too hard to stomach (a girl being trampled to death and a CGI animal getting ripped apart are just two of the many examples), but I do think it added to the feeling of depravity that Noah is supposed to experience which makes him believe that God does not want man-kind re-populate after the flood.The only real issue I had with this movie was that it felt like two movies rather than one. It begins as this action/adventure fantasy-like epic and then once the flood starts to come, becomes more like a dark, psychological drama (which felt much more like an Aronofsky movie than the first). Despite that, I thought the movie worked well.I'm not saying it's the best movie, because that's not the case at all, but it's still a great one. Despite popular belief among this site, Noah is a fantastically unique Biblical adaptation worthy of being seen. Instead of reading the ridiculously uneducated ""reviews"" on here, do yourself a favor and listen to the critics who review movies like this AS THEIR JOB and would know more about what makes a good/bad movie than anyone on here. If you want a movie about religion that will coddle you and tell you all about what happens to those evil non-Christians who don't follow the path of God, I suggest you watch ""God's Not Dead"". Except you really shouldn't unless you want to support a movie openly backed by an anti-LGBT hate group.",Noah
811,rsprengel,An Interesting Take,6,31 March 2014,"As a Christian viewer of course I understand the flap over the liberties taken with the story. One would not expect any product coming from Hollywood to actually reflect any Biblical truths. That aside, it was interesting to see the film examining the confliction in Noah, his human traits expanded and the human sinner verses faith in his God showcasing an inner struggle over the task he was given.As a movie, the technical effects were very well done, the grand scale of the animals entering the ark and all of the visual dramatics of the flood itself were incredible. I enjoyed the beginning of the film more than the end, and if you are going to the theater to see it, well, be aware of the film's length.Over all, the story presented did keep one interested and the visuals are fantastic. I see the controversy as something of a good thing. If it introduces people to the Bible and get's folks talking on the subject it's a win for all involved, a chance for those not familiar with the book to get acquainted and a teaching moment for those upset that the story isn't true to fact. I'll take a chopped up Bible story over the rest of the Hollywood junk pile any day!",Noah
812,villageiowa,Should have been named - Man survives a flood,1,31 March 2014,"THIS MIGHT CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO Most of the stuff in the movie I could live with, but the central theme was the doctrine of devils. I cannot believe how anyone could assassinate the character of someone as good as Noah but this movie pulled it off. If you want your biblical Noah to appear as a man who sees visions and reads messages in storms as communication from God to KILL, and that the creator desired Noah and his family to perish, even at Noah's own hands, then this is the movie for you. It was clear in the bible that Noah took even a hundred years or more to build the arc, yet in this version, these rock angel creatures ""fallen angels"" built it in a fraction of the time. Then after they helped built it, and also keep the other people that were to die in the flood away just long enough for the real tidal wave to come through, then they were allowed back into heaven.",Noah

Although the story is somewhat different to what you would have read, it's a new take on the topic. The story may not be to the liking of many but on a whole this is definitely a movie worth watching, if not for anything, just to see the potential of how new era can bring biblical stories to life. Russell Crowe has risen up many levels with his acting in this movie and the rest of the team gelled-in well to deliver commendable performances. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and never felt bore throughout the movie, so it's a thumbs up from me.",Noah
815,rfanning-70-422583,Review - untainted by religious bias.,8,3 August 2014,"This film was not perfect by any means but it certainly does not warrant a 1 out of 10. It had some really emotional, touching moments in it and had some great effects. Who cares if it was not biblically accurate (well apparently a lot of people) - it's entertaining.Not a fan of Ray Winstone and his confused accent which I find distracting. I also found it irritating how easy it was for the bad guy to manipulate the child of Noah. And then the business of Noah convincing himself he had to murder the new born babies. But I liked the relationship between Noah's family and the effects when the animals all arrived at the arc. The battle scene with the giant rock men was thoroughly entertaining. And I thought the film took me on a nice journey into a fictional world. I loved The Fountain, Black Swan and Requiem For A Dream, and Noah in my opinion was not as good as any of them, but it might have been because started watching with high expectations. Not Aranofsky's best, but good nevertheless.",Noah
816,manunsdb,I choose to do!!!,7,6 September 2014,"A movie apt for our time to see and experience God. We tend to accuse God for everything that happens to us, most often for the not so good things that take place in our life. God becomes, for, many of us, a giver of things which we want not even what he thinks best. However the movie tells the story of a man who decides to act according to the wish of the God for the betterment of the creation. The most beautiful part is that God does not tell him anything that he needs to do, rather in various dreams some things are reveled then remains to his decision to do or not. It is in himself that he finds the voice of God and he is ready to respond to it even when it is the worst thing to do. The movie speaks of a God who is not interested in predestining the future of Noah, rather who is interested in giving him a chance to take the decisions. The movie also have an ecological point of view, when it stress the human as the destructs of the creation and the nature. It also clearly mentions the myth that the meat can make us strong. The movie depicts the man with greed and revenge as worse than animals. The director has taken a wonder full turn to express the need to take charge of our life rather than accusing God for all that is happening. It is a wonderful movie I really enjoyed it.",Noah
817,playdafunkymusic2,"an absolute Tragedy of film epic. *Full of spoilers, do not read if you have not seen the film*",2,29 December 2014,"I am not religious so when I went to watch this film I went in with a neutral outlook and of course you expect it to be subtly Christian as it is based on the bible. But be warned if you are not Christian you probably will not enjoy this film. *Spoiler (do not read on if you have not seen the film; it has been said)The level of cringe in this film is unbelievable due to many reasons such as: the *angels* I say loosely, which are none other than Michael bays own transformers with a rocky outlook on life. This film literally has 20 or so rock giants fighting off hordes of humans to stop them getting on the ark. Admitted this probably was the most entertaining part of the film - and then to add evn more adrenaline fueled action to this heavily catholic film - out of nowhere comes the leader of the bad guys whom jumps 20feet in the air; plunging a spear into the heart of one of the angel rock god creature thingys showing to the other *bad guys* that the angels can be slain. Need I go on.. I then move onto the next topic of Noah himself *spoiler alert do not read on if you have not seen the film* The scene which I would deem so unnecessary and one of the biggest WTF moments was the scene where: Noah's son has recently just rescued a Girl from near the bad guys base(The only girl who somehow escaped the cannibal bad guys who were locking up all women for the slaughter....)His son then proceeds to lead the girl through the forest back towards the ark(She is also the Last chance of continuing the human race assuming only those on the ark survive the flood... Don't ask) leading her back through the forest when she gets caught in a bear trap(set by the bad guys who are gaining on them) when suddenly none other than his dad(Noah)appears, and has to make a split 10second choice before the baddies are upon them; either to free the girl and most likely she'd lose a leg at worst, or carry her and she'd be fine..... or(as the film did) let his son's new girlfriend be trampled to death by the oncoming savages.... that's right Noah.... supposive savior of the human race in the early days, chose to let an innocent girl die for no reason other than she was not of their blood and does not deserve to live in the new world. I cannot convey how unnecessarily brutal that scene was. *spoiler* Oh and towards the end, noah went full retard when he was trying to kill his two unborn grandchildren with a knife.... Leading to his exile in the new lands after the flood. I literally cannot describe how much Noah just came off an asshole and how bad this film was. I implore anyone who reads this to watch the film with friends just to laugh at how appalling this film is. Good Day.",Noah

819,billorourke-73956,Thought provoking epic,7,7 April 2016,"The term 'biblical epic' is enough to render the most sensible film-goer numb at the prospect of another bombastic smash over the skull. 'Ben Hur', 'The Ten Commandments' or 'The Passion of the Christ' do not inspire much confidence in cinema's ability to render the human element from the spectacle demanded of big budget movies. Full disclosure – I am an atheist. I take an interest in biblical stories purely from a curiosity standpoint.Mainstream Christianity and Judaism have long since abandoned the position that these stories are literally true, more often viewing the bible as a talisman for the spiritual guidance of the flock. The genocides, slavery, rape, torture and desecration of humanity that exists in so many of the bible's canon are often glossed over by the faithful today but those stories were written with a purpose. They found an audience willing to listen, believe and act on them. Who were these people? What was the state of their humanity? Did they have had the ability to think, to feel and to empathise as we do. Did they have the capacity to reason right from wrong, separate truth from fiction? What were they really like and would the answer shame us? We have no way to know for sure who these people were and how they thought. The documentary and archaeological evidence can be dug up and appraised, analysed and speculated upon. These are academic pursuits beyond the casual reach of the general public. Ultimately it falls on mainstream storytellers to breathe life into the past, through novels, TV and movies.The story of the flood and Noah is one of the truly awesome biblical tales. Global warming and climate change alarmists lend the story fresh impetus. The challenge to combat climate change may be a challenge from on high. The Lord himself said every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. The challenge of rising sea levels may yet prove him right. Advances in science have reached a point where catastrophic flooding might be avoided but there seems little inclination to do so.In this telling we see Noah and his family living far from human society. What glimpses we see of the world of men are fearful and hellish in imagery. Men are led by brutal force and scarce resources are rationed to feral masses. Noah is driven by fear and contempt for mankind. The set-up is told faithfully. Things get interesting when the filmmakers deviate from the text. In this version Noah has lived a devout and righteous life. As Noah watches the degraded humanity on the outskirts of the forest he decides he cannot vouch for any men, not even his own offspring or successors. Goodness is not genetic. What may start from a place of honesty may become corrupted by greed or jealousy or any other vice of man. Noah comes to believe that the Creator wants man to die in order to allow decency to prevail on earth. However, it is not actually apparent to the audience that this is true. This is Noah's own judgment from his observations of the corrupted souls of men. He decrees to his family that they must be the last of their species. They will save the animal and plant kingdoms but they will not procreate. His family are not impressed.When Ila announces her pregnancy, Noah resolves to murder the child if it is a girl. Here we see another divergence from biblical text. In the story of Abraham it is God's angel who stays Abraham's hand. Here, at the point of reckoning, Noah cannot bear the burden of infanticide and drops the knife of his own accord. Is he being weak or strong at this point? Was he just mad all along? Was it a test to see if he had the humanity to stay his own hand? Is this an inversion of the story of Abraham and Isaac, where the test is to prove his own mercy in defiance of God? The spectacle and narrative drive is provided by the clash between Noah and the men who need to get into the ark. A battle ensues between the fallen angels in the form of rock monsters called 'The Watchers' and the advancing hoard. The world of men are held back until the flood crashes upon the scene. The battle then distils down to an act of betrayal by Noah's son Ham. The youngster is at odds with his father's decisions, especially allowing the death of his girl, trampled underfoot by the masses. Ham harbours Tubal-cain, the dangerous king of men, on board the ark. It's a side story but one designed to emphasise the lack of control any man has over his own children. Ham is his own agent with his own emotional motivations. Noah cannot decide things for him without repercussions. By the end of the story Ham sets off on his own journey, leaving his family behind.So, in the end, what do we learn about our ancient antecedents? The murderous and terrifyingly brutal nature of man portrayed here is as uncivilised as any you will see. But these hoards are illiterate, uncivilised and prone to all manner of ignorant superstitions, how are we connected to them? 20th Century history teaches us that even so called advanced civilisations can produce absolute calamity. It happened twice during that fateful century. Should an asteroid come and make man extinct would the world be a better place? Are we so arrogant to presume that it is God's design that we inhabit the earth? Nature in the deepest wilderness of the planet can provoke awe when left untouched by man. If we figure that an idyllic Garden of Eden could only really exist in the absence of man, then we could consider the world better off without us and the notion that original sin is a real and tangible thing.",Noah

The writings below may contain some spoilers.Read it at your own risk....I find the explanation at the end and the story to be excellent. The men believed that they had the right to take everything they desired and lived by that. Most important they killed with that idea as an excuse. Noah was given a vision with what will happen, a chance and a mission to save the world, but no direct approach and explanation.He started to believe that all men should perish but nobody told him that.

The story of Noah's Arc as told by writer/director Darren Aronofsky, is not your Daddy or Mommy's strict Biblical version of Noah. This story has been infused with much artistic license. Humanity has been very, very naughty and seem hell bent on ruining the planet with ecological nastiness. Of course this pisses off God to no end and he decides to pull the plug and reboot the planet. It's Noah's job to save the innocents (the animals) but not necessarily humanity. The fun starts there with Russel Crowe's deep Aussie accent adding gravitas to everything. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Noah's hermit grand daddy. And Nick Nolte as the gravely voice villain king is terrific. It's all totally entertaining and a nice twist to the Noah storyline.",Noah
827,zpconn-1,One of the most misunderstood movies of the last five years,9,21 September 2014,"This is definitely one of the most misunderstood movies of the last five years, if not the last decade.The problem, of course, is that the source material is so delicate to so many people that many viewers will find it impossible to grapple with an interpretation of this ancient tale which is at odds with their own.On the one hand, you have the very religious viewers who will be offended at the great creative liberty taken in the movie and won't be able to understand that this is not and was never intended to be a Sunday School lesson.At the other extreme, you have the die-hard atheists who hate the story of Noah's ark with a passion due to its obvious impractical elements and who will also be unable to appreciate this movie for what it is.For most people in the middle, I suspect they would have appreciated the movie a lot more, but most of them will be too pre-disposed to dislike the film because of the extreme vocal antics of the above two groups.That doesn't leave too many folks who are able to detach themselves from the source material, ignore existing reviews and critiques, and accept the movie on its own terms.As for me, I was really shocked at how good this movie actually is. People saying that this is just ""Transformers meets Waterworld"" are drastically simplifying a story which actually has a lot to say.Here are some of the ways in which this movie legitimately surprised and impressed me:Despite being based on a religious text, this film is clearly not about religion. It's about mankind. It manages to take a religious tale, extract the core elements, emphasize them to a degree that has never been done before (because other films are too focused on preaching to the choir), all within a world that is more abstractly mythological than religious.You'd expect a film about Noah to be extremely preachy about the wickedness of man. I was shocked to find that, while this film does show the virtues of faith, it *also* shows the dangers of faith. Noah's character here comes to believe that the purpose of the flood is not to give humanity a second chance, but to literally wipe us out. He's so driven to complete his task that he nearly commits infanticide to ensure that mankind does not reproduce and goes extinct. I think it took serious balls on the part of the director to include this element in the movie, and this is probably one of the reasons that folks have had so much difficulty digesting the, shall we say, novel interpretation in this movie. For me, though, it made the moral lessons of the movie actually meaningful. The classic story of Noah is extremely one-dimensional. This version actually has depth and considers the possibility that extreme religious faith is not necessarily a good thing (a notion which, naturally, could be quite offensive to some). It promotes the agency of man while emphasizing the necessity of restraint and foresight.The fall from grace of mankind is illustrated in the movie in quite a vivid and interesting way. A vision of Adam and Eve shows the two figures literally glowing, as if they were illuminated from within by a golden luminescence. Earlier humans clearly had sorts of ""superpowers"", as illustrated by Methuselah, but these abilities disappear in future generations as mankind grows further and further detached from its glorious beginning in the first garden.The movie shows the Giants, the fallen angels, in quite a creative light. Rather than making them base and evil, they are shown to be compassionate towards humanity, and they ""fell"" only in the sense that they disobeyed the creator in order to intervene and help mankind. As punishment for this intervention, their otherworldly bodies were turned to stone, but they retained their great stature -- hence becoming stone giants. I thought this was a clever way of bringing together a lot of elements of the biblical story that are usually completely ignored. To say that this is just ""Transformers"" is to completely miss all the depth of the characters of the giants and the brilliance of how it ties together many elements from the classic story.The giants also play a very practical role in the movie, as they aid in the construction of the ark. Little details like this actually help the story to make *more* sense than the Biblical version.The movie doesn't make the colossal mistake of focusing too much on the arduous construction of the ark. Instead, rightfully, it puts the focus on the moral conflict humanity faces, not the boring construction task.The ""villain"" of the movie, the leader of the rest of doomed mankind, has some fairly convincing arguments to make, saying that we were created to subdue nature and to have dominion over it. There are points where Noah legitimately seems crazier than the bad guy, and that is something that few movies can pull off. It forces you to re-consider your basic assumptions about the story.------------I'm going to leave it at this for now. What I will say in closing is that you should try to see this movie with an open mind. If you allow yourself, I think you'll find that this is actually one of the better epic-scale movies that Hollywood has produced in the last five years.",Noah
828,TomC02,Artsy writers ruin a good story / movie,5,28 June 2014,"Brief summary of subjective judgment : Artsy writers ruin what might have been a good retelling of a very interesting story / history.I'm going to place all of the blame for a big disappointment on the writers. The acting and overall theatrical assemblage was good enough ... but actors given a bad screenplay / script and stupid direction are bound to fail.Aronofsky and Handle started good and ended badly. Seems that they had a thing for creating a dynamic melodrama reminiscent of As The World Turns (soap opera-ish) within a historical epic.The later 1/3 of the movie involves some really stupid dialog and poorly engineered interpersonal conflict. Perhaps Aronofsky and Handle were drawing on their own troubled childhood and paternal conflicts to add what they may have thought was useful character development ... or something. When movie scripts go bad you can only wonder what the writers were taking in their coffee or martinis.So, see the Noah movie for the first 90minutes or so. The script really starts to flounder and the story drowns in hackneyed personal angst and conflict during the voyage on the big flood. You won't miss much leaving at some point when ark is finally at sea. Don't worry, surviving the flood works out just as in the book version of the story, so you already know the ending.I'd almost encourage someone to take the movie and re-edit it to replace the soap opera portion with something more pertinent to the aspects of life at sea with a few thousand rescued creatures. And the 'starting life over' part at the end would have been worth some more investigation.",Noah

Christians and Jews may not like it as it is not their version of Noah.This version of Noah addresses the reality of when humans become too cruel and evil.If people can suspend belief to watch the Superman Transformers and Spiderman, maybe they can toss out their biblical notions of Noah and enjoy this movie. Most of our action hero movies always have some ""superhero"" to rescue us. In this version, Noah is a hero that pushes the boundary of being human and in the end he is a real hero to his family. The movie address the conflicts within a real human family. Noah faces real issues of love, compassion, and mercy. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly ... great choices.",Noah
830,johcanada,"""Wah wah, I read the bible""",9,29 March 2014,"This is every review I have read so far that is negative. A bunch of people whining and whining that they know the bible story and this movie didn't deliver an exact copy of the story. First of all, to anyone crying over the bible story they thought they would get, nowhere did it say this was going to be a religious movie. Secondly, have you never seen a Darren Arronofsky movie before? What you expect his movie will be is always wrong because he always takes you on some kind of interesting journey. I have been a fan of his films since Pi, and aside from Black Swan, which I found to be one of my least favourites, he has always delivered some thrilling or emotional content.This movie was great. Not his best, but a great movie. I know the story of Noah, to a degree. I know the basics, and since this movie is ""inspired"" by that story, that is all I needed to know. People picking apart ""facts"" that were wrong is ludicrous. Russel Crowe was great and insane in his devotion. Ray Winstone was a great antagonist. All of the younger actors did their part and Anthony Hopkins was great and amusing. Amazingly enough if I had to complain about the actors it would have to be about Jennifer. She wasn't terrible by any stretch, but I have seen stronger performances from her and guess I expected more.The one real complaint I have about this movie is the incorporation of a lot of the CGI. Some of it was a bit painful to see. Like watching the stop motion hydra fight or King Kong in some old movies. Not a deal breaker but it didn't help the immersion.This is a good movie. The story is pretty cool, the actors work well, the pacing is great for what the story needed. For both religious and non religious alike, use your brain. Don't expect a documentary. Expect a movie ""inspired"" but the Noah story and told by Arronofsky, because that's what was promised, and that's what we got.",Noah

832,s_m_r_b,Too many strange twists and dark undertones will kill the movie for most viewers,6,5 December 2014,"If you know the Director's work well, the first thing you will be wondering is how Darren Aronofsky, who brought us films like Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, could possibly make a movie based on the well-known Biblical story of Noah's Ark. Noah is certainly Biblical and it is epic beyond-a-doubt, but it also incorporates that dark undertone that has made his films so popular. Right from the beginning, Noah takes a very different path from the story that most adults and children alike have come to know. At first it is intriguing, we see the characters develop and get pieces of a story we never knew existed....and then come the talking rock people, or ""guardians"". If you are able to fully accept these creatures after your initial ""What the hell are these?!"" response, then you may be able to get through the movie and you might even enjoy it. The majority of the population, however, will not. It might just be too ridiculous for the average viewer. Oddly enough, all of the world's animals (in groups of two) making it onto an ark made out of wood is not the most unrealistic part of the movie - in fact, that part is almost believable. Noah has all the makings of a blockbuster hit. It has the cast, with Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Emma Watson taking the lead. It has a 2+ hour running time and breathtaking visual effects. It also has an amazing Clint Mansell score to submerge the audience in the story and bring it all home. Unfortunately too many strange scenes and characters, coupled with some seriously dark and heavy religious elements, kill the movie for most people. It should be noted that Russell Crowe did a fantastic job portraying Noah as a complex character who experiences extreme guilt but who also stands by his convictions. He's gritty, passionate, complicated, and pretty bad-ass when it comes down to it. The movie's failure to please the masses had nothing to do with the characters and everything to do with the story itself.Unfortunately, those who watch Noah expecting a simple (and predictable) 21st century spin on a well-known religious story will be disappointed, but those who absolutely love Darren Aronofsky and understand his work will probably enjoy the film...if they can get past the rock people, that is.",Noah

834,harbin-47925,Fantasy meets bible and doesn't work on either,2,20 July 2020,"I was incredibly disappointed with the movie. The special effects that so many people talk about may look interesting but the real disappointment is the lack of coherent narrative for the story. The producer/director seems to have got caught up in the special effects portion of the movie and forgotten the actual storyline. Someone mentioned that writer pulled information from gnostic and old Jewish mystic tales and the story actually looks like cross between Harry Potter, Transformers and Ben Hur. It just doesn't work. They used all sorts of mystic and weird ideas to hobble a story together that doesn't work on any level. Biblically it's completely off, morally it has nothing to add, and as any kind of romance or action movie it just leaves most of its viewers confused.Harry Potter movies are better and they suffered from the same issue.

I don't mind writers taking some liberties but to take a great biblical story like Noahs Ark & turn it into a carnography movie (lots of blood & gore) is just absurd & down right insulting. They make Noah out to be some kind of psycho monster family abuser. Noah even goes as far as threating to slay new born babies (his own grand kids) because God gave him a sighn to do wow really. Don't worry though folks Noah & his loving family lived happily ever after but not before he mentaly abuses the heck out of them to the point to were they don't even like him & question his morals on many occasions. He threatened to kill his daughters newely born babies & puts his family through emotional hell like what is this rubbish I'm watching. He doesn't even show any remorse for the way he treats his family & as soon as he found out his daughter was prgnant he announced it to his family that he was going to kill the baby as soon as it was born. Made his family live in fear of him for 9 months was so messed up. His own sons were even shown that they wanted to kill him. It even gets to the point to were Noahs family created a raft to try to get away from him, but of course he destroyed it by setting it on fire damn. Again boys & girls don't worry though because they all lived happily ever after minus the horrifying nightmares his loving family occasionally has of Noah going phyco & killing them all in their sleep.

When I went to see this movie, I was aware that there would be a few liberties taken with the story. But I would never have guessed it would not really be the story of Noah at all. Instead, the only biblical accuracies were: there was a man named Noah, there was a boat, there was rain. There were a few more correct points but overall this film completely overhauled the story and made it completely different from the biblical story. It really started with the rock people.

838,kpittadaki2,Disappointing and shallow,3,17 September 2014,"I sat down to watch the movie having heard the worst critics from my friends, but since this is Aronofsky and I'm a big fan of his movies,I felt I should have an opinion of my own. Well, let me tell you if this movie is one thing, sure isn't Aronofski...It is not also a religious movie.Any similarity with known names and persons is purely coincidental, I would rather say. So, I thought myself ""ok, cool down, maybe Aronofski wants to explore other ways of cinematography and make a turn to the blockbuster kind"", but still he is very far away from this kind, since neither the graphics nor the idea of them is something so pioneer and spectacular (with some small exceptions during the first scenes of the flood). I did watch the whole movie though, until the last torturous second, in honor of the actors, who are great and do the best they can. I suppose Mr Crowe must have imagined that he would play a role for the Oscars, when he first red the script, another Gladiator of older times maybe, so it is really a pity that the director did not make a movie strictly with profound characters and lack of so much useless blood and moving/speaking rocks (even if they are supposed to be fallen Angels)! Mrs Connelly is as always adorable and touching, Ema Watson and Logan Lerman are included in the promising actors of next generation, Ray Winstone always puts a little something with his role and Antony Hopkins was just with a bad make-up! To conclude it is a great pity to have this cast, a story from the Bible that could be transformed into Aronofski's hands into divine scenario and instead of pure magic, you get this.It is truly disappointing and I really hope that the director goes back to lower budget movies through which we all loved & appreciated him.",Noah

Apparently the screen-writer didn't like that idea and decided to leave poor Japheth and Ham without wives, unless you consider the twin daughters of Shem that were born on the Arc. Where did all of this come from? Don't call this movie Noah if there is no effort to tell the Biblical story! And why did Noah have to be a psychopathic killer? He was a horrible father and was not even able to communicate with God. There was also a nice story told by Noah of the creation that subtly alluded to evolution as the way that man got on the earth.

841,john-denny,They should have called it something else,5,13 April 2014,"Having watched the trailers, I was so looking forward to this film, and even took my friends. As the Bible account of Noah can fit into a page of A4, obviously the film makers had to add a lot of plot to fill it out to a feature length film. Indeed there is a lot of scope to do this: Noah's wife and his three daughters-in-law are hardly mentioned in the Bible, not even being named, so the film-makers had to develop their characters, and could create interesting sub-plots around the various relationships. In the film Noah has a series of dreams about the flood; now this is not mentioned in the Bible, but it is certainly one of the methods God uses to communicate with men, so it is an addition rather than a distortion, and adds a bit of excitement and gives them a chance to show off their skills with CGI.But to call the film ""Noah"" surely requires that they leave the basic story-line intact. But they didn't. The angels who came to earth because they fancied the women were turned into bizarre stone men (very uncomfortable for the women, but they didn't go into that); as a consequence the Bible description of what happened to their offspring had to be abandoned. Instead of taking three daughters-in-law onto the ark, they took one girl-friend, who Noah thought was infertile. One of Noah's enemies managed to sneak onto the ark without Noah's knowledge. Perhaps the worst thing, in my opinion, was that God was left on the side-lines, and couldn't even make the decision himself to preserve humans or not, so left that decision to Noah.So whether or not we agree with the personality they decided to give Noah is a matter of individual taste. Drugging the animals so they didn't interfere with the film may have been a cop-out, but we could have gone along with that. But playing fast-and-loose with the story just seems unnecessary. Who is the film aimed at?All in all, very disappointing. Bring back Cecil B. DeMille!",Noah

The bottom line was the Spirit of Noah's story was accurate. The acting, the story, the effects were all beautifully done. I can't say enough about Russell Crowe, Emma Watson, Jennifer Connelly - as well as Douglas Booth and Logan Lerman - Anthony Hopkins was excellent as well. I went to Sunday School faithfully through my childhood and knew there were some holes, but in this movie as well as other Biblically based films, the Spirit of God shines through. I urge everyone to not reject this film based on these story ""discrepancies"". It is more than worth seeing (I saw it twice!). It is long, I was never bored. I would like to see church (I am Lutheran) youth groups and bible studies take this in and discuss it. I think illustrations like these make it more than just ""a story"" to our youth. They have brought NOAH to life for me in a very visceral way. No-one could make this exactly as each Christian or Jewish religious base sees it. There is always some unhappiness somewhere (and healthy appreciation of the errors in media). Healthy Debate only strengthens us and helps us to focus on the truth and there is plenty of truth in this story.

846,oloveo,The story of Prophet Noah peace be upon him,1,5 July 2014,"The story of Prophet Noah (Nuh) peace be upon himThe 10th of Muahrram Imam Ahmad narrated in the Musnad (his book of Hadith) through the route of Abu Hurayrah that once the Prophet passed by a group of Jews in Madinah. The Prophet realized that they were fasting the 10th day of Muharram. The Prophet asked, ""Why are you fasting this day?"" They said this was the day when God rescued Prophet Moses and the Children of Israel from Pharaoh who drowned as well on that day. It was also the day the ark of Prophet Noah landed on Mount al-Judiyy. Noah and Moses fasted that day as an indication of their thankfulness to God. Then the Prophet said, ""I am the one to fast that day "" and told his followers to fast the 10th of Muharram as well. He justified the reason for fasting that day by saying, ""We associate with Moses more than others do"". The Prophet said this because Moses was Muslim as all the prophets, and we are more deserving of rejoicing his victory.Prophet Noah (Nuh) Dear brothers in Islam, after the death of Prophet Enoch (Idris) several events occurred over time that led humans to commit blasphemy for the first time. There were five pious people whose names are mentioned in Surat Nuh, verse 23. They were Wadd, Suwa^, Yaghuth, Ya^uq, and Nasr. After their death, Satan came to the people in the shape of a man and told them to build statues of these five men. The people responded to the whispers of the devil and built these statues to remember and honor these five good men. After a long period of time Satan reappeared. Ignorance had spread widely and many tribulations had occurred among the people. The statues had become very common among the people. When Satan came again, to a later generation, he ordered the people to worship these statues and told them falsely that their ancestors had worshipped these statues too. God sent Prophet Noah (Nuh) to these people and ordered him to warn them against a severe torture that would befall them if they do not return to Islam. The time span between Enoch (Idris) and Noah is one thousand years, known as the first era of ignorance. In these years, the first blasphemy was committed and became widespread spread among humans. Noah was the first Prophet and Messenger sent to the blasphemers. Prophet Noah said to his people, ""O my people worship God for He is the only One Who deserves to be worshipped."" He said, ""if you do not repent and leave out blasphemy, then await for a day in which a severe torture will come upon you,"". He constantly reminded them of the great rewards of being Muslims. Unfortunately, most people did not respond to his call and consequently did not come back to Islam. Prophet Noah spent 950 years calling the people to come back to Islam. Only about 80 believed in Prophet Noah. The people were extremely harsh to Prophet Noah, and inflicted a lot of harm on him. They were so nasty that they once tried to strangle him, until he fainted. Each century exercised more enmity to Prophet Noah and his followers than the previous one. Prophet Noah told his people, ""My role is to convey, but God is the only One Who creates the guidance in the hearts of the people."" Prophet Noah did not get despaired even though only a few people responded to his call. But when God revealed to Prophet Noah that no one else of his people would believe he supplicated to God to destroy all those who did not believe, a supplication which was fulfilled by Allah. God ordered Prophet Noah to build an ark. Prophet Noah gathered the wood, tar, and iron for that ark. The people mocked Prophet Noah for building an ark on a dry land and away from water. God ordered Noah that when he sees a sign to start loading the ark. The sign was seeing water flowing out of an oven made of stones that belonged to Lady Eve. God sent the rain from the sky and as a result the beasts gathered near the ark. Prophet Noah took a pair of male and female of each kind of animal. The believers also went on the ark. Water sprang out of Earth in large quantities causing the Ark to rise. The rain fell in great masses like mountains as described in the Qur'an. After six months the rain stopped and the Earth started swallowing the water after which the Ark rested on Mount al-Judiy in Iraq.God protected Prophet Noah and his believing followers, and inflicted the punishment on the blasphemers. All the blasphemers drowned including the son of Noah, Kan^an. It was narrated that when Prophet Noah was about to die, he was asked the following question by the angels, ""How did you feel your stay on earth for so many years?"" Prophet Noah replied, ""I saw this life on Earth like a house with two doors. I entered through one door and I left through the other."" He meant that it went so quickly. Allah knows best.",Noah

The Flood here is analogous to man-made climate change, which some say is the response/reaction of Gaia to man's treatment of nature. This water-punishment by the earth is epically portrayed here.2. The ""silence"" of God confuses many of the humans. They say ""The Creator"" hasn't spoken for generations. They yell to the sky ""why don't you speak to me?"" ... not realizing that He may be speaking all along, through nature, through their own inner consciences, and through one another. Ultimately, the Creator speaks through love. Noah initially misinterprets the silence (and certain natural signs) as ""kill the next generation of humans"" but the Love in his heart wouldn't allow him to. Later, he learns that it was a Choice given to him by the Creator.3. Noah and his family are vegetarians who have great compassion and respect for animals.Just a few thoughts that made the movie inspirational to me. Looking forward to your thoughts and reflections about the meaning of the movie.p.s. About the entertainment value -- this movie has excellent acting and CGI / special effects.

Stow-away on the ark? Noah bent on killing the first-born granddaughter? Ham without a wife? Don't think so. Japheth also appears too young to be married, but married he was, on the ark. And Tubal-cain...if he was still alive, that meant he was older than Methuselah, since he was born way before all of this. Yeah.On the other hand, I have to give credit to the depiction of the ark, which was actually closer to the scriptural account than what I had imagined.In the end, I let this movie die, and I'll never see it again.

Relax people, it's just a movie, nobody is pointing the finger towards you, nobody asked you to watch and comment. Who said Bible was true ? I mean you were all actually there when it all happen ? Or you just want to believe it because they say it's true. I STRONGLY believe in GOD, but i Strongly believe GOD is not represented by our church, whatever, and i AM sure that no bible can actually tell the correct events. For everybody who actually defends the Bible, you should read more, you should also investigate if the Bible actually gives all the correct information you all Defend. Other defended it too, others were actually damned by the church itself or just proclaimed heretic because they had the courage to comment it. I would like to personally ask the church to make a movie about the life of Thomas Paine, and every other writer, scientist that had to guts to ""investigate"" the events described in the Bible itself based on real facts and real data.",Noah

It has very little in common with the Bible version but that is not the problem here. It's just difficult to tell what it was supposed to be about really. Yes the actors are superb but it doesn't change the fact that the film has virtually no plot, no point and no message.Even if we take the story out of biblical and cultural context it still could have been an enjoyable movie.

Darren Aronofsky & Ari Handel have succeeded in using $125 MILLION to prove P.T. Barnum's famous adage, 'There's a sucker born every minute.' This was wretchedly painful to watch, and I certainly had hints of its grade school depth early on in the first few minutes of ennui mixed with confusion. Thankfully, Ray Winstone makes a great villain, although this script is such a simplistic piece of drek, I have the impression the actors are just laughing their way to the bank.

And yes it can't be in between. In brief, and if we ignored the religious part which sounds like provoking a lot of people here, history should be told as it is.
Noah, isn't just a religious story, it's history, this kind of movies in 20 years will be a way for kids to know about history, and excuse me I don't want my kids to be misleaded by wrong tales of history.
Imagine this, someone makes a movie about Jesus .. who's in doubt of what really god wants!! 
God picked up Noah, Jesus, Moses and Mohamed ..etc. with confident of their intuition and knowing that they won't be lost -at least with basics- 
Imagine this, someone made a movie about Hitler's intentions ... that he wanted Peace!
I know that the movie didn't variate that much about Noah's intentions .. but there was wide drifting from the real story .. abusive and harmful drift.
But let's suppose that there's no Noah, and it's not a history and not a religious story, the movie will deserve a 10 .. and may be couple of oscars.
It's great to be creative enchanting actually, but I believe there's a limit when it comes to certain things .... at least when it comes to making a movie about a real story.

The ending was wonderful and tied together all of the story. It is not often that you get a great ending in a movie. I would give the movie Noah 50% accuracy with the book of Genesis. Don't expect the movie to follow the Bible, expect the director's own interpretation. If you go into the movie with an open mind, you will enjoy it. The imagery was magnificent.

863,sanchesspurio,Awful movie - Not Noah's,1,4 August 2014,"I came to watch this movie because I thought it would be the biblical story of Noah. It is not. The movie should have an alert saying that this is a different version according to someone, inspired by the Noah's tale as seen in the bible. People came to ask me if the guardians were in the Noah's tales, if they were created in the second day, and some with some more biblical understanding asked me how would it be possible that fallen angels, considered demons, to come back to the heavens. All of these caused by the distorted movie.As a Cristian, as much as a Jew or a Muslim would be, I'm deeply offended by this movie.Noah was depicted as vegetarian. He lived isolated form ""men""or ""humans"". To end up with everything, wen good talked to Noah, it was a dream interpreted by himself. He then talks to Methuselah, his grand father who used to be a soldier with super powers that protected the demons expelled from heaves. Methuselah then give Noah DRUGS, some sort of hallucinogenic stuff they USED TO TALK TO GOD! Fortunately, the movie is so awful, that will soon be forgotten. The movie is awful from the beginning to end. Box office seems not to be doing well too, and I hope this serves as a lesson.The special effects are horrible. The Guardians shake like in a movie from 1920's. The original King Kong shakes less.There are many continuity errors, the waters are horrible and gray, the soldiers are all a gray mass.Even the dialogues are horrible, and the impression of Russel Crowe of a bad Noah is poor and does not make sense. Russel said Noah is mean because he let people perish. He saved animals. He knew people were bad. He was good with his family. It is not consistent to: a) Someone who understand God's calling. b) Someone who is good to his family. c) Someone who saves the animals. d) Someone who is saving the world. It does not make sense in the whole context of the movie at all. But he is Russel Crowe, I guess the director lets him do whatever he wants. In my opinion: Bad character analysis. THE FINAL SCENE, where he is going to stab the baby, and then can't, fell weak, and kiss the baby, is pitiful for someone like Crowe. How can a professional actor, at the last scene, perform so badly, bringing absolutely no emotion? I could do that for some millions to! IT WAS VERY UNCONVINCING and for someone who hopefully awaited for something interesting to happen at the grand finale... it was the stabbing that Crowe deserved.All in all, NOAH WAS LEFT A HOLLYWOODIAN MESSAGE FOR US ALL: ""we don't care about acting, the story or anything. We just want to sell. Now excuse me, because we have other movies to do"".Sadly, they can sell us any kind of bad movies, we will end up watching.",Noah

Literary license is to be expected, but in general this film is a different story with a few similarities to the original.

They seem to expect this story be made in a literal interpretation for the purposes of spreading their message, 'a ministry tool'. Aronofsky himself said ""Noah"" is ""the least Biblical Biblical film ever made.One Christian fundamentalist organization (answersingenesis.org) wrote ""We didn't expect Hollywood to handle the biblical account of Noah and the Ark with integrity and respect for the Scriptures."" ...and why should they?

868,samlichtenstein,An impressive take on tricky source material,8,5 May 2015,"I write this review completely lacking context. I don't know the religious or secular literature on the theology or historiography of the Noah myth. I'm only halfway through watching the movie. But I'm already willing to give this an 8/10. This film is accurately described as ""ambitious"" in many places. It makes an attempt to engage with 3000-year old source material in a meaningful way, which is something that can't be said about many films. The degree to which it succeeds at this attempt is, of course, debatable, but I found the attempt compelling in and of itself.There are many obvious points to criticize, but if we set aside the source material and the interpretation thereof, I find not too much to complain about. The technical direction of the film is fine, and evokes the grandeur of the Genesis story in quite a suitable way. Russell Crowe's performance is probably the weak link here -- it's a bit over the top, but it's not that bad. This is biblical material and that influences how one should ""read"" the ""text""; elements of plot and character development are stylized, but I'm willing to view that as intentional. I liked the way the rock-angels are portrayed.But what about the film as a whole, evaluated in its full cultural context? Well, any such evaluation depends upon what you think it aims to achieve. Personally I choose to read it as a commentary upon how the Deluge motif continues to inform our contemporary understanding of mankind's history, ethics, etc. In this regard I think the film succeeds completely. What is it saying? Are we supposed to be rooting for the rock angels as they kick ass against the descendants of Cain? What is the theological significance of the fact that Methuselah is a cannibalistic serial killer? Why, biologically, did the stab wound Hermione Granger received in her stomach as a child leave her unable to bear children? Only YHWH can answer these questions, but by raising them, Aronofsky has at least started the conversation, which is more than most of us can say.Say what you want, this movie is visually stunning and its plot is anything but boring. Much like the world it celebrates. Also, I'd like an armored armadillo-dog as a pet.",Noah
869,ak392,Exhilarating Film,8,2 April 2014,"This film based on the biblical story of Noah was an exhilarating thrill ride with much more philosophical and emotional depth than even the Genesis story itself. Christians can enjoy this film as it does not do away with essential religious ideas on ideas and sins such as salvation, temptation, lust, violence, and most importantly, man's will vs. god's will. While biblical scholars will no doubt say that some of the events in the film absolutely did not take place, many of these scenes add to the overall message that the biblical story was attempting to bestow upon humanity. Liberal-leaning people can watch this film and enjoy it as not as a literal story, but as a parable on environmental dangers humanity is imposing on the world. Action enthusiasts will find plenty to enjoy, in case they haven't noticed, it has Russell Crowe. Enough said.

This wreaks of a left coast production. Russel Crowe is not a very good actor either. I swear he's type cast in his role from ""Gladiator"". He's always somber, sullen and inanimate as if he's due to go out into the arena. The mike pickup is bad too because it's hard to understand what he's saying at times because he has a tendency to swallow his words. Too many back shots of him too. What's up with that. I can see why this wasn't well received in the Muslim world due to its deviation from scripture both their Qu'ran and so too the Christian Bible. The director would have done better if he'd created Noah along Cecil B. Demille's ""Ten Commandments"", then it would have had more gravitas at the box office and better received.

The ""creators"" (are they nameless?) of this movie borrowed only the names of Noah and three sons and left the entire real story out of whole film, start to finish.Nowhere does the film explain God's real reason for the flood, but instead uses it as a vessel for pushing vegetarianism and environmentalism. I cannot believe that those responsible for this film ever read the account of Noah. For if they had ever read the Scriptures, they could not have completely discarded His Word.The script not merely takes license with the story, but erases it completely and inserts instead a poor fantasy and excuse for special effects. There was nothing recognizable about the story as related in the movie.The acting suffered from the poor script, for the conflicts were contrived. How sad it is, just from a creative standpoint, that the writers chose to omit the truth and substitute such a bad story line instead.Why not take the Biblical accounts and create films of value and truth? Those stories need no embellishment.I hope viewers will also be readers and read the Biblical account for themselves.

874,ColeMiller,Solid but not amazing,7,10 May 2014,"The film is truly the greatest telling of one of the oldest stories we have at our disposal. However this is not the children's bible story version we are all too familiar with, but more closely related to the Old Testament version as possible. In the Film, Noah (Crowe) sees a vision of a coming destruction that will cleanse the land of all evil things (men), and is set a task by 'the creator' to build an ark to house two of every animal on the planet saving them from said destruction. As he carries out this divine will, he battles with his own faith as well as throngs of barbarous thugs led by Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone). Russell Crowes portrayal of Noah is hard to categorize in terms of either good or bad. He was decidedly average for most of the movie, but this fact is forgotten when it comes to the scenes that count. At his best in this feature he rivals his own performance in Gladiator, bringing a lot of that same intensity and melancholy spirit. Ultimately, Crowe was definitely the best choice for this role, hands down. In terms of cinematics, this film does not fail to impress. The CGI and special effects aren't anything we haven't seen before, but they do have some uniquity to them that will definitely stand out to the audiences (you will know what I mean when you see it). The props, costumes, sets, and locations leave nothing to be desired and secures the most authenticity possible for the story, but the cinematography is absolutely fantastic - definitely the stand out in this production. Picture a cross between Lord of the Rings and 300 (or Gladiator), with some awe inspired wide angle landscapes, and a relaxed/tactical use of lens flare that'll give you chills, the cinematographer delivers some serene scenes. All in all, Noah isn't exactly a stand out and probably won't get a best picture nomination, but its cinematography coupled with its CGI and decent acting performances earns it at least a 7/10 in my book.",Noah

The ark story has been produced multiple times trying to bring a smile because the innocent creatures have been saved. In this case this movie could be considered a scandal because it is a rare adaptation, Aronofsky style socio politics, utopia, hallucinations... This director's interpretation made some or many changes from the traditional story which could result in debate with the public expectations.Specifically reviewing the film, this is a modern blockbuster, computer giant monsters with robot voices, a full visual of huge structures build up, the medieval scenarios,the crowds the sharp men stabbing each other with the sword, the old wizard man.There is so much going on with the story, the supernatural, the mythical, the cosmology recapitulating the big bang, at some point the story just rushed so fast that the ark was build in a blink of an eye (by the watchers helping fallen angels turn into stone, giants made of stone transformers looking), the kids growing up in a blink of an eye and of course the cheap teenager runaway/rescue drama, the daddy issues, the super hero, made it very predictable maybe boring.I recognize the directors effort and mad passion in other films but with this movie he has made some errors, ransack genres far-wide, so much canned drama and for some people translating a story it into his own terms.I recommend to see the movie keeping in mind this is a very rare adaptation.",Noah

There were also some deep messages that gave me food for thought.Noah is an intense film, it questions vital matters, such as who is a sinner, who deserves to live or die and through the adventure of the main character we also face these questions. It makes you think that humans could really do a lot more to protect the environment and that we should be grateful that we live on such an amazing planet.Both Russell Crowe and Emma Watson did a great job and I have to say that I am a fan of both of them.

877,zeningge,Valuable effort by a mainstream Hollywood director (little spoiler),8,5 May 2014,"I really don't quite understand why the negative reviews. As a Christian myself, I first of all don't find it is offensive or anything. Far from it, I enjoyed it immensely. Both Aril and Darren cooperated in the Black Swine, which I like very much also.The movie's success is largely because of the excellent script by Aril Handel. He managed to filled in what the Bible left out in Gen 1-6 and tells a quite compelling story. I guess this is also the reason for those negative comments for lack of truthful interpretation of the Bible - they forgot this is a movie, an artistic rendering of the creation. If they really want to watch a word- by-word translation of the Bible, there are numerous Bible movies out there for Sunday schools. I can guarantee the faithful retell of the Bible story.I also don't agree with another school of criticism claiming Noah does not have mercy and being a hateful hero. On the contrary, this is exactly what the movie shines. Noah, first of all, is righteous in the eyes of God and he obeyed God's order in every way he could, even though this would mean he has to kill his own grand daughters or let his ""would-be"" daughter-in-law being killed by the mob. He is a human being and has weakness. Russell did a fantastic job to depict his struggle and sometimes hesitation. When he was about to kill his grand daughter, everybody is anticipating that God would intervene. But he didn't. Instead, he allowed Noah to show his human-side of mercy and love. This is exactly the freedom that God has given us.",Noah

Don't know why people got upset when Noah was angered about the babies at first. He was following the creator's will and had to live with hearing people dying during the flood. I am glad he didn't kill them, but I just could understand him being upset and thinking the creator's plan was being disobeyed. Just based on what was his overall mission.If you are vegan you will notice a lot of nods toward veganism. Noah really emphasizes the innocence of animals. At one point Noah says, ""They think it makes them strong (eating flesh). They forget it is the creator that makes us strong."" I wouldn't be surprised if that is another reason why people disliked the film because it showed the barbaric side of humans. I have my own personal beliefs. I am not an atheist or religious bible church goer. I did appreciate this movie however. The story was good and I didn't expect it to be word for word the bible. The graphics were superb as well.",Noah

If there was a - 10 then that would still be too good of a rating. If Russell Crowe gave me a million dollars in cash I might consider forgiving him And shut up about this.

881,mark-peay-679-232373,"A thoughtful, wrenching vision of an impossibly difficult task depicted with creative power and surprising imagination",10,1 April 2014,"First of all, SEE THE MOVIE YOURSELF instead of not seeing it for the sake of not seeing it because some moron or group of morons told you not to see it because of what they heard about it even though they actually didn't see it, or because they lacked the capacity to comprehend the film's contents.Secondly, do not expect 'accuracy' as there is NO SUCH THING : the Bible itself has been rewritten countless times with translation revisions, modifications, 'updates' etc. over the course of the better part of human written history. All that we have is interpretation, perception, and concepts - so share, embrace, debate, ponder, and let the concepts touch and transform you without stunting your intellect. If viewing this film with an open mind seeking to expand your human potential with an empathetic heart, a journey awaits that will take you to horrifying places, into the depths of madness and despair, lift your spirit with hope and encourage belief in the impossible, question the very essence of faith and examine the foundational elements of justice and mercy.This film ponders with jarring spectacle and elegant tenderness one of the great dichotomies of the human experience : how can Justice and Mercy be balanced? or can they?Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel simply ask the key question WHAT IF in the telling of the story of Noah.What if this pivotal event described near the very beginning of the single most highly read text in human history DID happen, and one man was called upon by 'the Creator' to actively participate in the near genocide of all beings in the world 'with breath'? how would his faith be tested? how would his family react? how would he undertake such a task? who would come to his aid to help complete the task? who would he need to be BEFORE the task was communicated and understood, in order to receive the Word in faith and get to work toward its fulfillment? in the moments before the flood, understanding that all life was to be wiped out across the world and that his true fundamental task is to help preserve ONLY the non-human elements of creation, who would this man have to BE to stay the course? who would oppose him, and how would he defend against such foes? how would Noah and his family persist and who would they become as the world becomes submerged and is 'cleansed'?And of course the biggest questions : at would level would human misdeeds have to be to prompt 'the Creator' to take such drastic action upon all worldly beings? what next steps / conclusions would Noah feel necessary given the magnitude of the task and its intent as it relates to his own family after the flood recedes and his task is complete? For the most part, these are not simple questions with simple answers provided in the Bible. This film helps offer possible answers to them in meaningful ways while also drawing parallels to our current human condition, including our relationship to one another, the world we live in and its other inhabitants.YES there are many strange creatures and 'magic' depicted in this film - but remember the story upon which it is based on includes a myriad of unexplained circumstances, phenomena and 'miracles' - no matter which version of the Bible you hold.Any film this bold, adventurous, exhilarating, wrenching, awe-inspiring, and thought provoking deserves praise and an open view. I must admit prior to seeing this film I was not nearly prepared at how moved and transformed I would be by the event - which had me deeply reflect on my own belief and faith. Any film with such power is worth seeing.",Noah
882,apollobez,"Great Actors, Good Visuals, Awful Script!",4,30 March 2014,"Any movie can be made bearable with the addition of a marque cast, but just barely, bearable.Russell Crow, Jennifer Connelly and even Emma Watson deliver excellent performances in this poorly written, oddly directed and sometimes, visually pleasing film. This fact alone, could only bump my rating a couple of points, as, they really weren't given a decent script to work with, and the ""confused"" direction of the film, distracted from those performances. I wonder if lazy editing wasn't a major culprit in wrecking the continuity of this film as well, as overall, the movie was disjointed, choppy, and put me in mind of that ""forced"" type, droll story telling, typical, of C rate Christian films. This magnified the ""YAWN"" factor as several snores could be heard in the half-packed IMAX theater only 30 minutes into the movie. Also, it's worth noting that there is a contemporary ""post apocalyptic"" feel to the setting, that only served to confuse and weaken the experience further.If anyone still feels the need to see this film, please do so at home, where at least you'll be comfortable, it'll be out on DVD before long.

883,artespecialist,Just Awful,1,3 April 2014,"--Warning spoilers! Honestly i do not see the point of the movie.160 million spent for what?If you want to make a Science Fiction movie, than choose a story or imagine a good one(see MARVEL, LOTR), make a solid script..etc ..and hopefully the story line /the effects/the acting... is good enough for the people to enjoy....but when you choose a Bible story you are bound to respect certain things. From a Christian point of view, i think that if someone wants to recreate a Bible event, in a big budget movie, they should make it as close as possible with the Bible text. Like i said the only thing common with the Bible text, found in Genesis 6, is the name Noah, and the fact that there was a flood. Everything else failed miserably. You can read it yourself from the Bible. The idea expressed there is that Human Kind reached a level of wickedness so high in the time of Noah, that GOD repented that HE created human beings.(Every inclination of the thoughts of human heart was only EVIL ALL the time). The LORD wanted to destroy everything(animals included)....but Noah found favor in the Eyes of the Lord, because Noah was obeying GOD and through Noah the principles of GOD would prevail, the ultimate goal being that Jesus would come on earth and would save us all. God TOLD Noah what HE was going to do, and gave specific instruction on how to build the ark. Also is stated that the people who were saved and entered the ark were Noah's family including his sons along with their wives. So Shem, Ham, Iafet each had a wife of their own.Instead of concentrating on more important stuff like: God saves, Gods mercy, the power of faith, the importance of obedience to God's words as they give life...etcThe story line of the movie focuses 70% !!! of the action around the struggle to find a wife for Ham, and Iafet( they only give a ""wife"" to Shem in the movie), and points out what a cruel world they will all have to live in, especially Ham and Iafet as they will not have anyone to have sex with. Then the focus moves to Noah's plan, as he struggles to stop the line of man kind and he goes after the children of Shem,(to kill them) only to change his mind in the last moment. This is the plot !!!! Just awful... Not to mention the betrayal of Ham, the motive being not getting any female touch in his life, and all of the sudden he wants revenge on his father, concealing a criminal at the board of the ship and plotting with him on how to kill Noah....The idea is just awful, and it misguides the whole point of the flood, as it twists completely the hope found in the Bible...i will not even write about ""the Watchers"", which are a fallen race that wanted to help man kind. It felt like watching the Ents from Lord of the Rings.Even the effects quantified alone, besides the story, are average...From a Movie enthusiast point of view, if you want to use imagination, at least do it properly. I understand that the people involved in the making of this movie are entitled to spin one subject as they like/please, but i believe that some deontological rules must apply. For me this movie was the same as the following example:If I had 160 mil to spend on a movie I will make a Lord of the rings replica movie where i will tell the story of the mixed race of the NazGul/Ringwraiths and the Hobbits, the NAZHOBBIT. It just does not work..... I was SUPER disappointed.I wanted to leave several times, but remained just to be able to write this review. This is my first review and i made an account just to let others know that is not worth spending money on this movie.The only thing that this movies excels in, is total misguidance. Based on the facts i must say that this was the goal all along. I feel bad spending 138 minutes of my life..just lost time.",Noah

Please, don't pay any attention to those who say the movie is silly, stupid or whatever! I guess, such kind of things mostly say russians (or whoever else) who strongly convinced that any movie MUST completely repeat the original story! They forget that cinematography is a real art - art without boundaries, prejudices and all the conservative frames! Filmmaking is, first of all, a possibility to express the director's own point of view at the problem. And his (her) vision might dramatically differ to what/how we can see it! And if the director sees it his/her own way - it is first of all his own right. The Noah story is a mix of the emotions we experience while watching different scenes, pictures - heroes' personal dramas, visions of the Big Ban in the divine aspect, beautiful pictures of the nature, Earth and human race' tragedy... The Noah story is a perfect acting of Russel Crowe (who's not my fav. ever actor)...

If you are a Christian don't watch this movie because your brain is obviously not mature enough for this movie and your reviews are terrible and don't do this movie justiceAnyway, this is a compelling story and the best version of Noah's ark I've ever seen. I walked into this movie thinking it was going to be be a load of sh*t but it wasn't it was really quite epic, it was fantasy mixed with a classic fiction tale.This movie showed god in a way that would be completely true, he had filled Noah with a terrible task, when he said that the babies would die if they were girls I wanted him to die, and I seriously hoped he would have died in that battle between him and tubal the movie made you hate him nd then forgive him once he decided to turn against god and spare the babies lives. Overall this was an intense movie with a compelling story. 9/10 from me and for god sake... Don't see this movie if your a believer; your brain can't handle it",Noah
886,cpwusaf,Weird,1,31 March 2014,"Weird is the best word to describe it. Not at all close to the Biblical story. Here are some of the strangest parts: They had fallen angels, build the ark. These demons thought God was unjust to punish Adam and Eve, so now they help Noah save mankind when God wanted to destroy them. Sin, is not really sin, sin it turns out is not being good to the environment! Noah is crazy, tries to kill his gradnchild to end humanity because he thinks that what God wants. The children of Noah, Shem, Ham a Japheth get on the ark with only one woman (plus their mom). So Ham and Japheth are told, ""sorry"" no wives for you. Never mind that the actual Bbible story had them take wives on the ark, God and Noah build the ark to save humanity from depravity, etc.",Noah
887,pricesusan01,Choices,9,14 May 2014,"I loved this movie. To me, it seemed that it was about choices - the ones we make and the ones imposed upon us. This Noah is conflicted, frightened, sad and angry - a man trying to do the right thing under impossible circumstances. Russell Crowe does a wonderfully understated job, as does the rest of the cast - especially Emily Watson, Ray Winestone, and the young ""Ham"". The scene where Noah has to decide whether to kill his son's newborn daughters is so fraught with tension and pain that it is almost unbearable. The ""Watchers"" are heart-breaking in their separation from the ""Creator"" and their dis-illusion with men. If people would just leave their religious expectations at the door and take the film on its own value, I think the reviews would be more positive.",Noah

Both Methusalah and Noah take some mild altering drug (mushrooms, drop acid - who knows) and have ""visions."" Methusalah is seen kneeling on the ground for while ""looking for berries because (he) has a craving."" Munchies much? Noah claims he saw what god intended. Maybe the whole thing was just a bad trip. Either way, the movie isn't unwatchable. Everyone knows the premise of the story. The acting is good. It's just too bad it's wasted on a Bible story and it gets one star for that reason.",Noah

As a Christian raised but atheist turned man with heavy spirituality and more of a question mark, i thought this concept was great. The cgi was not too bad, and i thought the adaptation was unique. Granted a few parts were far fetched, but like i said, this is Hollywood. The acting was good. Not great but, good. A little over dramatic and over acted at times, but at the end of the film i was happy. I got the incest vibe a little though near the end. If Noah and his family were the only ones left to reproduce ""fruitfully and multiply"" there was def a little incest to be had. Granted I do have a 3rd cousin who is hott that i might have thought about sexually before. LOL Watch it, make your own decision before the reviews scare you off.

Noah is a great movie. The acting is very top notch, the idea that even though all humans are corrupted that they can choose to do great things and start over is great.I'm sorry the impossibility of an old man building an enormous arc was complemented with the impossibility of huge 4 armed rock golems helping them build it.

That's too bad. Noah is untrue to the only source material it has, and only relates to the actual story of Noah in a few ways: 1. The names of SOME of Noah's family are used. Getting to that later. 2. The ark design is correct. 3. There is a flood and a rainbow. 4. There are fallen Angels. Reasons this movie sucks: 1. Noah threatens to kill babies. Yep. 2. Only SOME of Noah's family is on-board. 3. Noah has a magical snake skin/arm band. I don't even know. 4. The fallen Angels are rock creatures, and sort of like the Iron Giant. 5. Ham betrays Noah, and brings Tubal-Cain aboard as a stowaway. 6. Awkward Emma Watson kissing scene (Although this could be considered good).

897,morganermter,Let's step back and breath.,9,10 April 2014,"Let me premise this review with two points: I really enjoyed this movie and two: I'm a Christian. I know a lot of you don't care about the religion behind it so I'll separate the two.JUST THE MOVIE: Aronofsky directs a movie that is awash with color, characters and of course: animals. From the beginning you are engaged in the story and the sweeping landscapes and dramatic zoom-out shots never get tiresome. While the movie has a slightly slow mid-section the action is constant and the dialogue intriguing. The fantastic world created by Aronofsky is familiar yet exotic and feels like a welcome escape from reality. Still, there is a grittiness that cannot be escaped and an attachment to every character that results in a roller-coaster of emotions. Go into this movie with no expectations and you'll find yourself emerging from a beautifully crafted work.THE RELIGION: First off anyone who complains about religion in this film has likely not done their research and those who have and still complain are missing the point. I won't go into depth but TECHNICALLY the movie is Biblically accurate (if you want I'll argue this in the comments or something) and the additions by Aronofsky are not divergences but embellishments. Translating a story from book to screen, and more specifically from author to author, inevitably results in changes. Aronofsky has made this story his own and in a wonderful way. The Biblical message rings true and if the critics look carefully enough even the additions carry their own Biblical connections. Anyone ever heard of the story of Isaac? Give this movie a break and DO YOUR RESEARCH. If God is truly an ever present God then he is in this movie as well, just look a little closer.",Noah

The movie is made by people that have little faith- and it shows. Don't expect ""God"" to be mentioned in this movie. You may know the story from the Bible as most do- take this and add in some Hollywood weirdness, you get Noah. Save your money! If you want a faith based uplifting movie- go see ""Gods not Dead"".As far as Hollywood movies go, it is nice to see an attempt at a Biblical film, which has not been done properly since 1950s ""Ten Commandments"" For a movie that could have been a family picture, the PG-13 rating is well deserved.*SPOILER ALERT* Rock people?!",Noah

Initially I was puzzled by the other species/creatures that were portrayed and the other person that was able to sneak into the Ark. I had a lengthily discussions with some friends who watched the movie. We concluded that Noah movie presented an unprecedented approach to a Biblical story and the apparent purpose is to make us think about the alternatives to what was mentioned in the book of Genesis, possible conflicts that may or might not have happened, but overall was very interesting and is worth watching.

You'll be less disappointed that you wasted your money and 2-1/2 hours of your life you wish you could get back on this one! The writer and director had a great opportunity here with existing technology to create something epic by simply bringing this story to life as it's told in the Bible.

901,LydiaNoneofYourBusiness,"Stunning, but for believers, some clarifications required...",10,30 March 2014,"I found this movie absolutely stunning. Beautiful cinematography, outstanding acting, and astounding special effects. Of course, there are a few things that fellow believers need to be aware of. The movie, 'Noah', is not told from an ultra-conservative point of view. There are multiple parts that can clash with your own beliefs. When creation is explained in the movie, it is portrayed in the fashion that God, or The Creator as He is referred to throughout the movie, used the Big Bang as His tool for the creation of the universe, and evolution for His creation of animals and of Man. Although I do not personally believe that is how He created everything, the movie tells creation beautifully and with God as the Creator, therefore I do not find it offensive.One piece of information that will be helpful when seeing this movie is the background and origin of the Watchers. The Watchers are originally mentioned in the Book of Enoch, an ancient non-canonical book of the Jewish religion. The Watchers are, as stated in the movie, fallen angels, but after that, the production team took their creative license. Since it is in neither the Jewish Tanakh nor the Christian Bible, most viewers will think that the producers simply made up the Watchers.Also, there are many gruesome and gut-wrenching scenes, for this movie reveals just how corrupt Mankind had become. There is no happy parade of animals arriving two-by-two, and Noah is not a happy old man with a long flowing beard In this film, Noah tries to follow exactly what the Creator commanded of him, taking himself past his breaking point. In this film, Mankind is scrambling for survival, taking what it wants and not caring for anyone else. In this film, the story of Noah is portrayed realistically.I implore you to go see this movie, but you must watch it with an open mind.",Noah
902,millert1409,Extremely Underrated,6,1 April 2014,"First of all, I want to make it clear that this film is not an exact retelling of the original Genesis story, nor is it meant to be. Most of the bad reviews seem to stem from this very fact. Yes, it's based off the story of Noah, so it should be accurate, right? Maybe so, but the sole fact that it is not, doesn't justify all the negative reviews in any way. Arnofsky changed and added some details, but in my honest opinion, I didn't think they were bad changes.Everything besides the accuracy of the story was excellent. The acting, the visuals, the cinematography, the score (Clint Mansell is amazing as usual), and yes, the story. Were they perfect? Definitely not. But, in my opinion, it was good nonetheless. So, if you go into this film expecting to see the story retold word for word, you'll be disappointed. My advice, is to go into the film, temporarily forgetting the story you all know so very well, and just let yourself enjoy what is actually a decent film.",Noah

That was just not suiting. Overall, it was a terrible movie. So much that I actually fell asleep during it! Save yourself from agony and spend that ticket money on something more useful.

This is very interesting and thought provoking movie which has epic moments of greatness. It is very believable and I thought the effects were pretty awesome. Although the first 30 minutes may feel a bit off-putting, ""Noah"" is a very well-made update on the old bible story that everyone knows, but with many things added. Going into the film knowing the basics of the Noah story, I thought Aronofsky did a very commendable job with this Biblical epic. It does drag in spots and runs about 20 minutes longer than it probably should have. All the performances were really good . Aronofsky is probably the most unique director today. I've seen all of his movies and most I really like. This big Hollywood movie is not going to be for everyone, and maybe questionable to people of Catholic religion, because to some, this movie may feel like an insult, but it's Hollywood's own take for entertainment purposes.

This is strictly a Movie for the devoutly religious Christians - no one else, Trust me you will regret sitting thru this 2 hr suck-fest if you get tricked into seeing it. A poster Movie for atheism if there ever was one.",Noah
908,Irwansyah-denny,Not too Bad,3,8 April 2014,"The movie is just so bad on so many levels. Nothing the actors could do would save this truly pathetic script. The trailers for the movie do not give you any idea of the silliness of the storyline - for instance, giant rock Transformers, formerly Fallen Angels, helping Noah build the ark! Russell Crowe tries hard, but without anything of substance to work with script-wise, he came across as a confused, angry, despot. The baddies were really bad, the ark really big, and lots of CGI animals of course, and it was just so horribly predictable - sort of part Tolkein, part Transformers, and part Sunday School.A total disappointment - some people actually walked out before the end, and there were lots of chuckles in the theater at some of the more ""dramatic"" parts of the film. However, on a serious note - movies cost money to see, and I felt I totally wasted mine with this one. Probably one of the worst I've seen.",Noah

Considering myself a cinephile/cineast I was appalled by this movie. Do not expect a plot that does make sense. My wife and I are still joking and laughing about the holes in the plot and the ridiculous lines the actors have. To avoid spoilers but still mentioning this: There are creatures in this movie who look like they came straight out of Jim Henson's labs. It felt like they didn't belong there.I really can't find anything good to say about this movie. The camera, cuts and sound works are solid but nothing special. The special effects are OK, but there are fewer than I have expected from seeing the previews. While I liked other movies directed by Aranofsky (The Wrestler, Black Swan) this one is a catastrophe - I have to assume the producers held him at gunpoint at the set.All in all I cannot understand why this movie still has more than 6.x on IMDb - I rather see this as a candidate for The Golden Raspberry (RAZZIE®) Awards.",Noah

However, ""Noah"" made me speechless for so long after the movie, and I left the cinema in silent, even though I was with a group of people. I needed time to processes this excellent film, and think about what I just saw.It's true that you'll get a Mad Max/Fallout/post-apocalyptic feel when you watch this movie, and it fit perfectly. Not only did it show you the evil of mankind before God's cleansing, but the director wanted to make a point out of essential environmental questions; like how easily humans can destroy the world (too much Co2..). And that point was very clear.Giants, yes, there are sources that describe giants way back to the beginning of the Earth. Let's not make a big deal about it - giants didn't join the ark, so no more giants.Humans are described in this movie as pure evil, and there's violence and gore, however not to the point that it gets ridiculous. I think it's just about enough, no more nor less.However, the film's ending is quite a scene. ((Spoiler?)) It shows that humans aren't pure evil, but can show love and kindness, and that's why we live today according to the film, because God gave us a second chance after the cleansing.There are a lot of theologically elements in this movie to, not just the story of Noah's Ark, but also the story about Job and Abraham's sacrifice.If you believe in God or if you don't, doesn't really matter. This move'll make you think, or re-think a few things in life. Maybe you'll be speechless too.And to end it, Emma Watson and Russel Crow acting together is pure love.",Noah

There are great stories in the Bible and throughout oral and written history, but not all the details are there so to tell it or film it. You need to fill in the gaps. Your faith or imagination does fill in those gaps and accepts the story as written. The screenwriter and director need to fill in more. So I enjoyed this movie, but then I like to stretch my beliefs and accept stranger things might happen. We know in all genres writers...or Noah's day...oral historians...would embellish their stories to make a point. NOAH visually, technically and script-ually took liberties and that was OK with me. It is still a good story. My husband couldn't get over the question how they could put the 2X2 animals to sleep without going to sleep themselves. Literal Bible observers probably can't get over a film that doesn't interpret the story exactly as they would have it interpreted, however, all literature is in the minds of the reader. Visually it was mostly amazing. Life lessons? Let's be kinder to each other because we're all capable of falling down. The firlm was worth my time to enjoy.",Noah

The movie, Hurricane, had a better flood scene than this, and that was made in the 30's. The overtone was dreary and dark, and I felt left with more of a feeling of dread and hopelessness rather than starting new life on a freshly cleansed planet. The plot was thin, the characters were unbelievable and the script was weak.

The fact that Hollywood makes you imbeciles believe whatever they want just fuels me enough to make a post with some actual truth to it.Half of the horse manure that was portrayed in this movie was a lie. What were those magic rocks under the ground? NOT IN THE BIBLE. NOT IN ANY DOCUMENTED GOD-INSPIRED SCROLL. Angels inside rock-like creatures to stay the white Caucasians from a attacking? Nice concept but NO. People didn't want to know squat about Noah because they all thought he was just crazy, but white people, as usual, try to make themselves as interesting as humanely stupidity allows.

920,devildan782000,A great tale without beating someone into submission over religion,8,1 August 2014,"I sat down to watch what would be considered out of my realm of movie subjects. I am not a religious person although I do reserve the right to be wrong when my days expire. Movies that have an outward religious tone tend to detract me. I understand folks have their beliefs and I do not hold that against them. What I do though is when they push their beliefs on me either through movies, books, or conversations.So the idea a man one day out of nowhere hears and sees Gods' plan to wipe out everything, essentially a clean slate protocol , is for lack of a better word insane to me. Today he would have been locked up in the loony bin for it. The fact he gathered all creatures to him like they had homing beacons in them and from all around the world flocked to his ark. He saves the animals, determines man kinds days are over and acts accordingly. Sounds like a good Hollywood movie subject. Not something that some believe actually happened years ago. So we are left with NoahAronofsky has directed many movies with such power and even if you don't always get the entire point right away least are left with a good movie. He doesn't seem to look at the world with eh same eyes as well all do, instead he shows you his side of it and lets you decide for yourself. Noah still follows this pathway and it should.This movie shows you a possible real world look into what it may have been like for the man. I glimmer into a feeling of his duty, responsibility, and hopelessness. The special affects do not leave you with a bad feeling, and the character development isn't lacking either. Are their some religious tones? Yes. They don't beat you down with it and they don't make you feel like this is the end all story too Noah. This story could take place today and it would still fit. Lets face it a clean slate wipe-out of the world could and at times look like a real good option. It states with certainty that man has caused this to occur and man must be cleansed. I for one can relate to this. We have made a mess of the world and we don't seem to realize it. Maybe some small push from this movie is what was intended in the first place.Noah heard and saw Gods vision of a world wide cleansing. Is it so much to ask that maybe we see the directors voice and vision as the same? Isn't that what Noahs' sacrifice was well about? If it is true and one man can bring about so much change, then maybe the same is true today. Noah states that.

I expected to see a biblically based movie with Hollywood effects, not mediocre story telling, assumptions, and lame special effects and wardrobe. Hollywood could have played around with so many things for fillers, the four couples and couple drama, the town and its lawlessness, things that could have made things so much better, they could have elaborated on the animals and the ark design, this movie was a total bust! The movie instead gave you a psychotic for Noah, two cry baby brothers, rock monsters that helped with building the ark, lame barren little girl, and a saint-of-a-grandfather that heels the barren but dies in the flood.

I do understand his point that The Bible is a work of fiction and if I was making such a film I would completely add giant CGI rock monsters, but to add giant CGI rock monsters and not have them fight things is just a terrible waste of time and monsters. Also why use Russell Crowe? The man is to comedy what Transformers was to science,was Laim Neeson not available? This only furthers my belief that Aronofsky has no interest in making a comedy film and wants to present the tale of a man who hangs out with rock monsters and fits two of every species on the planet into a very big boat as some sort of lesson in the values of modern life, If so this film is meaningless and has taught me nothing, If the world does indeed flood Ill probably just be saving my TV and my cat and I'm not even committed to saving the cat.If Aronofsky really wants to force Christianity on the movie going public he should have watched The Life Of Brian first, I'm pretty sure its gentle yet brilliant rubbishing of the Christian religion furthered its cause a lot more than the terrible and boring kick in the face which his movie displays.",Noah

The graphics were amazing and looked realistic. The script and acting was pretty great also, if you like Lord of the Rings, magic and miracles you will like the feel of this movie. Like I said this movie was not meant to the same as in the Bible. It is the story of Noah with a HUGE spin on it.

The only positive thing I can say is that at least the acting was good. This movie definitely made the viewer question the existence of God, actually I might go as far as to say could be viewed as an anti-Christian movie.

This movie is completely pointless. It doesn't have a good message, a bad message (well I guess that might be debatable) I don't know at first I was angry because I felt like they were making Noah out be the bad guy when that was not the case then they want to make him the good guy but none of that happened!

I'm wondering, ''Where's this coming from?'' Their depiction seemed more fantasy than Biblical. So many simple facts that are plainly stated in the Bible were completely twisted or totally ignored.

928,Mormon_Mike,"Not Religious, But Spiritual",7,24 July 2014,"First off, you need to know this is not your mother's Noah. Nor is it grandmother's, your Sunday school teachers or anyone else's for that matter. For a Bible-believing Christian to get the most out of this movie you need to understand that up front.What the director has done with this beloved Biblical survival story is quite liberal to say the least (not that the source text gives us that much detail to start with). So, there are rock monsters. The quicker you just accept this and move on the quicker you can get to enjoying the movie. If it makes you feel any better just think of the movie more as a Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy story that just happens to have some biblical names and a lot of animals in an ark rather than faithful adaptation of the more familiar Noah story. You can even imagine that the story takes place on another planet or in a parallel universe if that makes you feel better.Once you get all that out of the way you can sit back and enjoy what the movie really has to offer. And, in my opinion, it has a lot to offer. Great performances. Beautiful artistry. And a whole lot of spectacle that you would want from a story about an ark full of animals and a flood.It's heavy handed to be sure. Violent, humorless, and...environmental. But, unlike others Christians who were disappointed I felt there were subtle spiritual elements in the movie that make it worthwhile.A question that the movie raised for me was: how do we really know if we are doing what God (in the movie referred to as ""The Creator"") really wants us to be doing? Especially when what we *think* he wants us to do may seem to go against our very nature.Noah--full of integrity--is bent on doing what he thinks God has commanded him to do. This obsession (to do God's will) and the decisions he feels he has to make cause us to be extremely uncomfortable with his revelations (and rightly so). The process of revelation depicted is vague and messy. The gift that I feel this version of Noah offers to fans of the ""original"" story is to watch Noah struggle in the crucible of an Abrahamic-like test. In the end, I appreciate the director's version of the Noah story (rock monsters and all). In his version Noah needs to learn something how revelation works. And how God works. And, more importantly, Noah needs to learn something about Noah.",Noah

This movie was a total wreck. It was hard to follow and a lot of things made no sense at all or were barely explained. The acting itself was okay, but the story was just terrible. If you want to watch this movie as a biblical adaptation, look away because this movie doesn't only shy away from the historical and biblical account, but it takes a nice big dump on it too.So much was wrong with this movie, and my respect for Russell Crowe has plummeted because he was a terrible representation of Noah. For one, the Biblical Noah never received help from magical rock monsters. Also, in the Bible, Noah never had to guess or make meaning of what he thought God was trying to say, because God spoke directly to him. Noah also never had to fight people off and stop them from boarding the ark, because although he invited any and all to be rescued from the flood, everyone mocked him and dismissed him as a loon. There were also no stowaways on the ark, because the only humans on board were Noah and his wife, their three sons and their wives (two of those three wives were never seen in this movie by the way).

930,frank-63-838463,Don't think about biblical Noah too much.,7,29 July 2014,"Darren Aronofsky directed and wrote a story he wanted to tell. A drama about the biblical Noah created with free creative license to tell the story in a way that he felt would be compelling and entertaining. This is not the strict, or loose retelling of the traditional biblical Noah's Ark, nor is it a total fantasy, it takes elements from the traditional story and uses them to create a watchable drama. If the flood story ever really had any truth to it, who knows for certain what that truth was, unless of course you take whatever version of the bible you read literally word for word. From the perspective of not knowing what happened for certain, Aronofsky creates a convincing story of creation, man's wickedness, Noah's piety, and the flood. It's a fantasy drama that makes for a very good movie. Unfortunately , this movie will upset devout Judeo/Christian/Muslims, because the story uses so much creative license and strays so far from the biblical accounts. It even strays far from older Babylonian flood myths. This movie will also upset atheists, because although it is a myth/fantasy/drama, it also has a real sense of spirituality to it that will get under the skin of most devout atheists. Additionally this movie will also irk any science fiction fans as it is much close to fantasy than any attempt at scientific explanation. Who's left to enjoy the film?

For instance,Transformers!I surely missed the passage where they guarded the Ark and Noah's family and slew thousands of people desperately trying to escape the wicked planet earth with the chosen family. I really need to rethink my stance on what the Ancient Aliens theorists believe. I also missed the part where Mrs. Noah knew a thing or two about drugging animals to sleep, though that does kind of make sense so that it was less than a zoo on that smelly boat.Another chapter and verse missed was the stowaway! Not only that, a stowaway who instead of thanking his lucky stars he escaped being perished by the flood, decides to entice Noah's son into killing his father.And finally, I am sincerely dismayed that I did not read into Noah's character better to figure that the man would actually consider slaying his own grandchild due to her gender. If all of this were factual, and really none of us truly know everything in this popular Bible Story ,then that beloved story of a God fearing family being saved because of their beliefs,was mostly likely written by the those brothers Grimm,because indeed it was grim.

If this the best Crowe can do he might as well cut his wrist for I almost cut mine having to sit through this garbage and having to pay for it.

I have never gone anywhere near a Village Cinema outlet or looked at another Kiwi Crowe film. I watch what I want to watch on Netflix.Had Village shown a realistic trailer of this garbage to allow me to make up my mind, I would not have said anything but; there were no previews or trailers before the film was launched, and that stinks to high heaven; just like this garbage.The maker and actor of this film took the public for a ride here and I can promise they will never sit in the driver's seat ever again as far as I am concerned.

939,shikharsrivastava-34253,Excellent Film,10,27 December 2019,"This movie has probably the most undeserved rating on IMDB.
I mean 5.8 really???? That kind of rating is reserved for films like Scrapy movie have a higher rating!Okay Normally i would have rated the film about 8/10. This is not a perfect film but it is quite excellent.
The positives:
1) Russell Crowe is brilliant.
2) Some of the imagery in the film is truly breath-taking especially one scene about creation.
3) Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as ever, Emma Watson gives one of her best acting performances.
4) For me the best part of the film was Jennifer Conelly. The fact that she was not even nominated for an Oscar is a travesty. It's her best performance since Requiem for a Dream. (yes better than in A Beautiful Mind) she absolutely steals every scene she as a torn apart Mother / Wife.
5) The Ending: The Film pushes it's Lead to make a tough decision, something that a love. There is no escape for him as in so many different Films. The Character has to make a difficult decision and he makes it.Bad:
1) Special Affects is the most obvious one. Especially with the animals, they look very clearly unreal.
2) The Film suffers from pacing from time to time, at first in the very beginning when things take time to roll off. Later the scenes in the Arc are a bit slow.
Overall: Excellent film as expected from it's director. Had there been better special effects without certain pacing issues this film could have been even greater. Honest Rating (8/10)*I am giving it a 10/10 for the gross injustice of the rating here.",Noah
940,anorman_kerr,A Skewed Vision Of The Christian Religion,4,30 December 2016,"This is a disappointing movie. How the director and writers of this misguided fantasy did not accept that there would be preconceived ideas, indeed deeply treasured and believed in feelings and ideals, that would require a certain amount of verity and adherence to the well-known story of Noah and the Ark is a mystery to me. Perhaps if the film were entitled something else that would impart the fact that this IS a fantasy might have helped. However, I doubt it.When one takes on a tale so familiar, specifically one learned by many of us from our earliest childhood, then one is taking a huge risk. This requires a big payoff by it's conclusion, which this movie never achieves. It takes the ever familiar story and turns it on it's ear. The basic tenets are observed, but the story line varies uneasily from soap-opera scene-chewing to oblique and unexplained metaphysical bushwah, never finding a center to hold the untidy loose ends together.In many other ways, if you can ignore your own mind telling you this can't be what you want or expect to see, this has many simple and simply beautiful moments. There are some visually compelling special effects. There are scenes of natural beauty and animal close ups which betray an artistry and understanding of beasts in their journey to salvation.There are some decent acting jobs, most notably by Crowe, who has to put actual weight behind so many trite clichés that you might start counting. It's a study in frustration to watch some of the other actors, though, who sleepwalk through their roles as if they were attempting to impress a somnambulists convention. Yet others perform their craft by hollering and bellowing their lines as if you'll feel them truer if you hear them louder.All in all, if you've idle hours on your hands, you may wish to give this movie a look. I did so at home, and was glad I did not incur a fee at the movies so to do. If you are like me, you'll spend your time appreciating the good in this film, and ignore the (very many) bad moments it also supplies. Just don't expect it to be the story of Noah and the Ark as it has been handed down to us via church or other means, because it is so unlike it that this movie really should have been named anything else but Noah.",Noah

Of course, we all expect Hollywood to add fictional elements to any story to make it interesting, but we do not expect them to drive an agenda by using those elements in an absurd, sophomoric fashion.

950,Windseek,An insensitive and false representation of Noah,3,17 August 2014,"To many Christians the bible is the literal word of God. Yes many do not believe as Christians do, and that is there personal choice. However, I believe those who make movies should still be respectful, sensitive and accurate when touching upon things that others hold dear regarding their faith. The Movie Noah is built upon Christian scripture; yet, the representation of Noah and what God asks him to do is demeaning to his character and disrespectful to the faith of others.The scripture below shows that Noah knew that he and his family would be spared (including the wives of each son of Noah) in order that God's covenant could be established thorough him. This movie makes Noah out to be a man lost in all aspects of God's desire except to fulfill his plans even if it means killing those that he loves. I do not mind Hollywood taking liberty with the stories it tells. To Christians this is a literal telling of something God spoke in his Word and Hollywood needs to show some sensitivity and truthfulness when representing it.Gen 6:17: ""Look! I am about to cover the earth with a flood that will destroy every living thing that breathes. Everything on earth will die. Gen 6:18: But I will confirm (establish) my covenant with you. So enter the boat—you and your wife and your sons and their wives. Gen 6:19: Bring a pair of every kind of animal—a male and a female—into the boat with you to keep them alive during the flood. Gen 6:20: Pairs of every kind of bird, and every kind of animal, and every kind of small animal that scurries along the ground, will come to you to be kept alive. Gen 6:21: And be sure to take on board enough food for your family and for all the animals."" Gen 6:22: So Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him.",Noah
951,sertoxyan,This movie wasn't bad.,8,2 November 2021,"I know it had taken some liberties from the source material, but that doesn't bother me, because I see this as a re-imagining of the biblical story, not a perfect adaptation. How would you even adapt a story that old 1:1?The character of Noah here is an interesting one. Not a perfect human, even if he was chosen, through him we can see that even if you are consisered a good natured person, you are still human. There is no man without flaws, and we could see this here perfectly. That scene, where he had to choose between life and death at the end was especially emotional. Anyway, I really like this flawed Noah (character) adaptation.Ham was also an interesting one. While watching, I thought he'll get what he wants somehow. That scene in the forest with the trap, another great shocker. But not the kind of one that just surprises you and that's all, it influences the plot until the end. Ham helping Tubalcain on the Ark and choosing the right thing, even if he hated his father for his action. So human, or how should I describe it. Not just figures, names, they made these men real, flawed humans.Methuselah, also an enjoyable old man, his little obsession with berries, his miracles, and don't even get me start with that flashback scene with the sword and the flaming field.From that we can jump to the scenery. And man, this movie's scenery was just amazing. I would even say it's really underrated by this. Besides the somewhat grim nature of the movie, my favourite part was the scenery. A little side-note, I also enjoyed that it took inspiration from the Apocrypha. Anyway, the barren landscape, the cities, the forest from the seed, the visions, the flood, the army of Tubalcain, all spectacular, and I didn't even mention certain scenes, that one with Noah and his wife at night with their silouttes, the flight of the doves and the path of the river.Finally, the Watchers. I count them as part of the scenery, but they were really my favourite. A whole different backstory for them, guardians of the children of Adam, really symphatetic dudes. I also really liked their backstory, that scene is also very high up on my ""favourites"" list, their quick transformation from light to rock, the meteor shower, all fantastic. And their redemption and ascension. God is also rather symphatetic here, to allow his children to go back to home. Also, they are a really good explanation on how did Noah built that monstrosity of a ship.I also think it's a good explanation in this context, that the extinct animals were killed by the army of men, or by Tubalcain in the Ark.Anyway, I wanted to see a re-imaging of the biblical story, and I got what I wanted, maybe even more.

958,timk76,Maybe it's time for another flood!,10,6 July 2014,"First of all I must say that I didn't go and see the movie in theaters because of its bad reviews which was clearly a mistake. I was truly moved and many times close to tears when I saw it at home - not only by its theme but also by its flawless execution. Great actors to start with, beautiful cinematography and a simple but compelling story made this film worthwhile and really entertaining. That's probably one more reason why I'm genuinely shocked by all these polarizing reviews. Most of all because they are completely blown out of proportion. If you don't like a movie that's fine but giving it one star out of ten is just plain stupid and ignorant. Especially if it's the work of someone who brought us films like 'Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler' and 'Black Swan'. So maybe it's time for another flood because most people seem to have lost their connection to the divine since they're too busy looking at their smartphone all the time and now only enjoy movies as an even bigger distraction. Or worse, they're too caught up in following blindly the biased interpretation of a book that was written hundreds of years ago. This film is exactly the opposite. It has its own view towards the story about Noah making you again appreciate the simple things in life and meanwhile teaching you a way of godliness. Being an Aquarius who tend to be ahead of their time Darren Aronofsky probably couldn't care less about these dull comments. Still to all the 'one star' critics I want to say: Go out there and create something on your own for a change instead of just slagging off other people's hard work and creative endeavors out of sheer boredom or bigotry.",Noah
959,scott-45986,This is Noah's Ark - Not Harry Potter,1,26 August 2020,"A lot of people have posted on here that this is a great movie. But they are either just ignorant, or trolling. This movie is crap for too many reasons to list, but I will give three.1.) Virtually everyone that said they liked this movie, was not very familiar with the original (e.g. ignorant). Whether you believe in the Bible or not, the original story was not even close to this 'adaptation'. Aside from the names, this story missed everything else, including the main plot of the story (good vs. evil) and the moral of the story. It would be like making an adaptation of Star Wars, and putting the Starship Enterprise in it. Yeah, they are both space related genres. But they are contradictory to each other. The same with this film. They added science and scientists to a time-period that would not have this, took out all the villians from the original (Nephilim), and changed some of the good people in the original story (heros) into villains.2.) The acting was mediocre at best. Twice, you could see 'Noah' actually trying to remember his line, with an obvious scene cut. The three sons were simply horrible, and try your best, you could not build an emotional attachment to them.3.) Why someone hasn't mentioned the horrendous sound/audio to this yet (that I seen), is beyond me. The choice of music was like nails on a chalkboard, and it sounded like the entire movie was recorded on 1980's Radio Shack cassette recorder. I mean, it was that horrible.FINAL THOUGHTS: If you are going to make an adaptation/remake of a movie, there are certain lines you should never cross. At the very least, the general theme should remain intact, unless there is a clever twist (there wasn't). Otherwise, just make a movie called ""Bob's Ark"" and do whatever you want. Not bait-title people into watching something that it ain't.Considering the bad effects and sound for this, the only real value that could come from this movie is if they ever made a MST3K episode of it. Other than that, it isn't worth the hard-drive space on whatever server it resides on (imho)",Noah

They changed that in order to develop a subplot for dramatic purposes.If you're an agnostic or from a non-Abrahamic religion, then you might enjoy this movie very much. I know I did.Atheists who do not appreciate art, shouldn't watch this movie. It is meant to be taken seriously by those of us who ponder the idea of a god or gods.

It's decent to average, to occasionally good. Like most movies these days. Crowe delivers, Connelly is, well, gorgeous ; God this woman ages gracefully... The basics are sound.Where this movie truly shines is in its clever new take on the Old Testament. In a nutshell, and perhaps in some improbable attempt at pleasing both the agnostic and Christian crowds - looks like it pleased none - the movie fuses the classic Christian story of sin and redemption, of falling and worshiping, with elements of a very modern, very XXIst century teleology inhabited by giant aliens (the fallen angels), environmental collapse (the first 30 mns would fit well in The Road, or Mad Max) and global resource depletion (""my cities are starving !"" shouts Cain before taking over new land, like some bronze age Hitler annexing Czechoslovakia). And it works ; each side - the biblical and the techno-scientific - mirrors the other beautifully and imbues the movie with, paradoxically, a vibrant sense of authenticity. If you believe that myths are not fixed, that they evolve with time, always melting and reshaping themselves afresh, and if you don't take the movie too seriously, you will likely find the ride entertaining. 7/10.",Noah

967,andre1206,Not A Spiritual Noah At All,5,30 March 2014,"Darren Aronofsky's 'Noah' is a fantasy comic book version of the Biblical life of Noah, with strong influences from contemporary science fiction, and the current J.R.R. Tolkien series of films. As a Hollywood 'end of humanity' blockbuster it holds it's own, building up to a violent global deluge and a winner-take-all full screen war over mankind's last hope for survival, the ark. The differences between Aronofsky's revision and the original account are huge, in fact, beyond the ark and the lead character, he's dramatically altered almost everything else. Disobedient angels are seen building and defending the ark, grandfather Methuselah is portrayed as a recluse with miraculous powers, his 3 sons are unmarried at the time of the Flood, the animals he was commanded to gather simply show up on their own at the entrance door and make themselves at home inside without a word, then there's the silent 'creator-god' here that sends a lot of disturbing dreams to Noah allowing him to interpret their meaning on his own. What many will be going to see this for though is missing: the man of strong faith in God, that did everything he was commanded to among a generation of humanity that didn't believe in a coming end to their world (despite Noah's repeated warnings), completely preoccupied with their daily lives and the violent spirit that wicked angels and their Nephilim sons promoted. Sadly, in it's final act this Noah becomes a crazed man, seemingly 'alone' at sea too long, losing his bearing, rambling that no man is worthy of survival into that new world. His family in turn becomes violently dysfunctional and divided, and when they do finally leave the ark no one offers anything to this 'creator' out of thanksgiving for their survival.",Noah

So far it was terrible.But after the flood, it was trash (I mean it). Noah decided to kill his just born baby granddaughters. Then drinking problem!! How could they write such a pathetic story? At some point, I was waiting Jackie Chan to come with Spider-man to kill Noah and then marry on the Ark. (seriously)Wasted time and money seeing it.",Noah
975,wquayson,worst movie ever,1,30 March 2014,"Such a waste of a good story. I am so disappointed. I'm not sure why. What did I expect? This movie was a joke to Noah and his name. Dumbest movie ever. Worst movie of my lifetime. Without adding any spoilers, My girls and I was so disappointed I am really stunned. My hubby wanted to see Tyler Perry single mom's club which would have been a much better pick. I need my money back. This is how much of a waste this movie was. I will never watch another movie this man makes. Or another movie labeled biblical movie. I can't say it enough worst movie ever. It doesn't even deserve a 1, a 0 would be more fitting. An insult to say the least. Man can think God gave us the right to choose but they'll be for a sad awakening when Jesus returns. And Ham, what the heck was all that about? Where the heck did that come from? It is a total insult to black race. Oh I am so furious over this movie.",Noah
976,tskiki2,Air Conditioning,1,9 August 2014,"Enjoying the air conditioning on a hot/cold day is the only redeeming thing about this movie.Really, this is a great example of: 1. Having too large of a budget. 2. Overthinking the story. 3. Telling a mainly different story. 4. Pushing agendas that did not exist at the time. 5. Refusing to use the word or acknowledge God in any way.Basically, If they wanted to make a Sci-Fi movie they should have used a different story and not squandered the resources they had.You might as well call this movie, ""The Old Man & The Sea"" as it better follows that plot.I for one will continue to seek out highly rated low budget films and enjoy their creativity.This film is over rated at ZERO stars but I was forced to give it a 1.",Noah
977,tommycolorado-1,Not about sin,1,28 March 2014,"The directors interpretation of sin in the movie is left wing fodder. Sin in this movie is about people who ruin the environment by building cities, eating animals, mining, etc... NOT sexual immorality, violence, idolatry.Also, it turns God (who is not mentioned in the movie once) into 'mother nature' as he takes vengeance on the people for disgracing the earth.What a shame. And to listen to the atheist director and actors having no tolerance for Christians who don't appreciate their version of the story makes me ill..This is the epitome of radical left wing Hollywood BS",Noah

I waited forever! The 1st weekend in March came around ... What do you mean it's coming out at the end of this month?!?! WTF! Last night after walking out of the theater I wanted to pray. Lord, forgive us our many sins, this rising to the top of the list right now. I was embarrassed. My Grandpa is one of the salt of the earth types - introduced us to movie classics, Ten Commandments (Charles Heston RIP) being one of them and the Bible. He would beat the crap out of Aronofsky and and Handel w/his cane had he seen this. It was like the Book of Eli meets Lord of the Rings meets Noah.He had a good cast, Script should've been burnt.

979,frost_apn,A great story - that's nothing like its source material,8,8 April 2014,"I went into this movie with rather modest expectations, and during the first 20 or so minutes, I was as disappointed as many of the other reviewers here on IMDb. But this movie, due to the baggage of its name and the book from which it takes its inspiration, will float or sink based on what you bring with you into the theater.Let me make one point clear: This is *not* the Biblical story of Noa.If you want to enjoy this movie, take a minute beforehand to set aside your expectations and Christian associations with the title. The movie lifts its main plot points from the Bible, but it adds, changes and embellishes enough things to make it stand better as a work of its own. Don't think of The Creator in this movie as God or YHWH - he is only ever named The Creator, like some shamanistic world spirit, and if that's your frame of reference, you're more likely not to frown at all the inaccuracies and find faults, where you could be marveling at a pseudo-medieval fantasy movie with (for the most part) solid characters, great visuals and a plot and pace that lets certain characters grow beyond their initial roles.",Noah

I am a Christian and know the story of Noah well. While some parts of the bible story are slightly different, the overall message is still there. Its a brilliant take on what the story of Noah COULD have been like. The struggles, doubt, visions etc. It was a beautiful film that deserves respect. ""The Passion of the Christ"" was a brutal, realistic portrayal of Christ's death. Why all the hate for this film? Who wants to watch a sugar coated film about death and destruction of all life?

981,jellytip,Appalling script and execution,1,29 March 2014,"I was expecting something a lot better than this from a director such as Aronofsky. From the beginning the clumsy plot was even more ludicrous than you would expect - cherry picking convenient sections out of the bible and then adding elements such as Transformer-esque giant stone monsters to enable the plot to progress and stop Noah and his family from being destroyed by the warring throngs that weren't allowed on the ark. Noah came across as an unsympathetic murderous character wielding his power over all those who were at his mercy including his own family. The film was predominantly big blockbuster action while hammering home the view over and over again that humanity all deserved to die because of their inherent nature. As the film progressed I was hoping at least we would be treated to a decent portrayal of the flood itself, but no, the flood scenes were very brief and unremarkable. This was a big belly-flop with no momentum seemingly targeted at a pre-teen audience.",Noah

And now to fill up the limit of ten linesahem, I mean, To address the possibly biggest problem with the movie!

985,catesinclair53,Noah,9,29 March 2014,I was blown away by this film. Although it dragged ( just a bit ) in the beginning and the end I was not deterred. the graphics and art direction were extremely effective. The cast was wonderful. I especially enjoyed Jennifer Connelly's performance and hope she gets recognition for it. I just thought this movie was so cool to watch. I don't go to the movies because of the expense but I really wanted to see this on the big screen. I know that there are those that will disagree and that's fine. I am glad I saw it.With that being said after seeing the film I have a renewed interest in Noah's story and have been scouting the internet for more info. I am especially interested in his family. I feel it's a good thing when a film encourages me to learn more.,Noah
986,stubbysquid-1,An interesting modern perspective,9,7 April 2014,"I went to see Noah with an objective perspective. I was not sure what to expect but had always enjoyed the story. As with any movie its an art form and open to interpretation. I never expect literal interpretation of subject matter in movies from books. The reality is not everyone accepts a directors visions. I really enjoyed the direction of the movie because the focus was on the human condition,ritual and comparative mythology. The battle of good vs evil, the internal struggle of the characters, conflicts of faith and morals. It had a great cast and the cinematography was good as well. I enjoyed the inclusion of time lapse to include creation myth taking the viewer through quickly to add substance to the storyline . The landscapes were visually impressive perhaps not as colorful throughout like life of pi. My impression the use of light,color and shadow influence the viewers senses to convey the mood of the movie. Yes there was some supernatural elements to the film but I think that just added a more modern view to so many different topics touched upon in the film. I don't feel I lost anything by seeing the film more like I gained an appreciation for the directors/actors/actresses vision and use of artistic technique to convey the subject. I do not think the purpose of the film was to vilify a biblical story but to share a vision with us. I would say you may miss out on something interesting if you don't see it.",Noah

I felt as if I had accidentally walked into Transformers. Hollywood took so many liberties with this story, they almost shouldn't call it Noah. The plot twists in this weren't only inaccurate, they were just stupid and uninteresting.No, this is NOT a cross between ""Braveheart"" and ""Titanic"" as it was billed. Those were two great films. This was closer to a cross between Transformers and Water World. I wouldn't call it a spoiler to say the CGI rock angels appeared throughout half the movie and made the whole thing unbelievable at best, and completely uninteresting at worst.My advise would definitely be not to believe the Hollywood hype on this one.",Noah

This movie teaches that there are just 3 sons of Adam. Untrue. This movie teaches that Cain's lineage are totally corrupt and evil. Untrue. This movie teaches that fallen angels are rock creatures who tried to help Adam & Eve and their son, Cain. Untrue. This movie portrays doves as birds who walk like chickens and sound like pigeons. Untrue. This movie designed an ark the size of a cottage on the outside and as big as a museum on the inside. Untrue. This movie gives only one son of Noah as having a wife and names her. Untrue. This movie has giants but avoids calling them the Nephilim or explain where they came from. Frustratingly pathetic. This movie has 3 Caucasian boys as Noah's sons. Orientals, Ebony? Come on.

990,screamy8,Not what I expected.,2,30 March 2014,"I wish I would have read the reviews before seeing this movie. The movie was way too long. The ""Transformer guardian rocks"" were silly, and so were their battles. Animals were a tiny part of this movie. The acting was OK, but boring. Methuselah had the best character development, but he did remind me of Yoda. Unfortunately, his part was too small. Cain getting on the boat and the fight scenes were so unnecessary. I expected a an Epic Movie, and felt like I watched a made for TV Hollywood version of: ""Noah & The Transformers Build an Arc."" Noah could have been amazing. I see a lot of movies, and I would have walked out of this one. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",Noah

This take on the story was simply mundane and predictable. I did, however like the emotional struggles Noah had to face while completing his task. What I was not expecting was the science fiction that took place in the film. Had that been left out and man kind been left dealing with the same repetitions we face today (murder, greed, chaos, etc.) the film would have felt more historically accurate rather then a fictional tale only to be believed if magic had existed during the time of Noah. I am glad that I used my Fandango gift card to see the movie because otherwise I would have been upset to spend my hard earned cash. Trust me when I advice all to wait for Netflix. This was not worth the time in the theater.",Noah

That's just stupid!!!How about, Hollywood, you put forth a little EFFORT and find actors and actresses from the part of the world where Noah was reported to have lived and use THEM!!!???? What's more, people in Biblical Times did NOT have British accents!!! Great Britain wasn't even around then! Neither were the ancestors of that country!!And in the stories of Noah, there were NO rock giants! No magic! COME ONE!!!! Hollywood, you need to read the Bible if you're going to produce and direct a Biblical movie!!! You need to thoroughly study out the archeology, the history, the ancient cultures, and the scriptures. There were no armies besieging Noah as he built his arc. Noah did not kill babies!Noah - A Righteous Man:In a world taken over by evil, violence and corruption, Noah was a righteous man. However, Noah wasn't just a righteous man, he was the only follower of God left on the earth. The Bible says he was blameless among the people of his time. It also says he walked with God.

Over and over again, in the account of Noah's life we read, ""Noah did everything just as God commanded."" His life of 950 years, exemplified obedience.Since the wickedness of man had covered the earth like a flood, God decided to start over again with Noah and his family. Giving very specific instructions, the Lord told Noah to build an ark in preparation for a catastrophic flood that would destroy every living thing on earth. You can read a Bible story summary of Noah's Ark and the Flood here. The ark-building project took longer than the average lifespan today, yet Noah diligently accepted his calling and never wavered from it. Appropriately mentioned in the book of Hebrews ""Hall of Faith,"" Noah was truly a hero of the Christian faith. Noah's Accomplishments:When we meet Noah, we learn that he is the one and only follower of God remaining in his generation. He goes on to become the second father of the human race.

Amit Goswami, M.D. Call Today!As an architectural engineer and shipbuilder, he put together an amazing structure, the likes of which had never before been built.With the project length spanning 120 years, it was quite a notable achievement. Noah's greatest accomplishment, however, was his faithful commitment to obey and walk with God all the days of his life. Noah's Strengths:Noah was a righteous man. He was blameless among the people of his time. This does not mean Noah was perfect or sinless, but he loved God with his whole heart and was fully committed to obedience. Noah's life revealed qualities of patience and persistence, and his faithfulness to God did not depend on anyone else. His faith was singular and unshakable in a completely faithless society. Noah's Weaknesses:Noah had a weakness for wine. In Genesis 9, the Bible tells of Noah's only recorded sin. He became drunk and passed out in his tent, making himself an embarrassment to his sons. Life Lessons:We learn from Noah that it is possible to remain faithful and pleasing to God even in the midst of a corrupt and sinful generation. Surely it wasn't easy for Noah, but he found favor in God's eyes because of his remarkable obedience. God blessed and saved Noah, just as he will faithfully bless and protect those of us who follow and obey him today. Our call to obedience is not a short-term, one-time call. Like Noah, our obedience must be lived out over a lifetime of faithful commitment. Those who persevere will finish the race.The story of Noah's drunken transgression reminds us that even the most godly people have weaknesses and can fall prey to temptation and sin. Our sins not only affect us, but they have a negative influence on those around us, especially our family members. Hometown:The Bible doesn't say how far from Eden Noah and his family had settled. It does say that after the flood, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat, located in present-day Turkey. Referenced in the Bible:Genesis 5-10; 1 Chronicles 1:3-4; Isaiah 54:9; Ezekiel 14:14; Matthew 24:37-38; Luke 3:36 and 17:26; Hebrews 11:7; 1 Peter 3:20; 2 Peter 2:5.

Noah is a mad man that is being led by a God that is just a kid with a magnifying glass and we are just his amusement. they cannot even say the word God ..... only creator! God is good .... all the time. While some latitude is understandable I see believe this film is sending a message that the belief in God is only for crazies. This is wrong.

994,paross-1,Not The Story of Noah!,1,1 April 2014,"Warning. This review contains mostly spoilers, but the whole point is how errant this movie is compared with the Bible.I tried picking apart all of the differences between the film and scripture. Here's the highlight reel.Noah allowed Ham's girlfriend to die in the film. Ham was already married in scripture.Shem was the father of his other two brother's twin baby wives, there was no mention of pregnancy in the Bible, and all three of Noah's children were married. Methuselah had magic powers? Methuselah was not a key character in Genesis 6-8. This was twisting scripture and making it more like Harry Potter than the Bible.Noah psychotically tried to kill his own grandchildren... this flew in the face of what the story was supposed to be. Noah and his family were the only ones worth saving because of the wickedness and depravity of man. Here, they're psychotic environmental Nazis who aren't really worth saving either. Noah's ""visions"" were his inspiration. Biblically, Noah heard the direct word of God.A king sneaked on to the boat and tricked Ham into betraying Noah, where on Earth was this plot point drawn from??Fallen angels became Michael Bay type rock monsters who helped Noah and his family construct the ark before being forgiven and ascending to heaven while simultaneously fighting off all mankind. This was made to give the film some fun visuals and a second subplot. If this was it's own story they would have been fine... but wearing the bold name of a story key to so many folks with faith, this was ridicule.Darren Aronofsky had no business making this film. Please save your money!!!!!",Noah
995,searchingjuliet,Noah- A Sinking Ship,4,11 April 2014,"Noah (according to Moses) tells the story of a man, husband, and father, who due to his holy life, gains favour with his creator. Through a dream, it is revealed that God, fed up with mankind's wicked ways, has decided a great flood will wipe humans from the face of the Earth. Noah is tasked with building a great ark and starting over with his family and a male and female of every living animal. Noah, according to Darren Aronofsky and Paramount Pictures, is the latest in what will be a string of many grand scale films based on biblical stories.Aronofsky and studio executives unfortunately struggled with using the simple story laid out above and decided to weigh down the plot with extraneous side stories that turn this apocalyptic tale into an obligatory blockbuster. From teenage tantrums of not being able to find a spouse in time, to Noah turning into a deluded psychopath considering infanticide, to a more than contrite final showdown between Noah and the leader of a small tribe. While dedicating screen time to these mini conflicts, we eventually lose the humanity behind what is meant to be the end of the world and therefore lack emotional investment when all is eventually lost and then found again.Russell Crowe does do justice portraying the reluctant titular hero and gracefully transitions from environmentalist to tyrannical ship captain to doubting man whose heart wrenching struggles go unanswered by a God who has gone silent. Crowe's acting ability is one of the only things that makes Noah remotely watchable for all its 138 minutes. One thing also worth mentioning, is the films beautiful visual effects, some that bring about awe inspiring images from stony fallen angels, to the massive deluge from first drop to global wasteland, and finally the most stunning representation of the creation story that I've ever seen.We live in a time where technological advancements will allow us to imagine and portray the imaginative stories of the Bible but this cannot be the only focus of these films.

998,joefrinzi,Aronofsky's Noah floats to the top,10,11 April 2014,"DARREN ARONOFSKY'S NOAH As he did with finance in Pi, addiction in Requiem for a Dream, historical fantasy in The Fountain, sports in The Wrestler, and ballet in Black Swan, writer-director Darren Aronofsky has taken the Biblical epic and turned it on its ear with Noah! Visually audacious and thematically provocative, this is definitely not your father's Bible movie! Ten generations after Adam & Eve, the world of Noah is fraught with corruption, even as the afterglow of creation still marks the blue skies with starry residue. The progeny of Cain have spread out over the continent of Pangea in a corrosive wave of Bronze-Age industrialism which has left the planet a wasteland. Through the childhood trauma of seeing his father killed by Tubal-Cain, Noah is a deeply conflicted man who has done his best to shield his own family from the wickedness of the world. An apocalyptic dream about a watery end to mankind sets the stage for the creation of the ark, with the help of giant rock creatures who are fallen angels with their own vested interest in humanity's rebirth. All of this is handled in a most flamboyant and cinematic manner that is recognizable to anyone familiar with Aronofsky's oeuvre. Without giving too much away, I can say that all is not well on the ark, as Noah becomes increasingly convinced that mankind doesn't deserve to live, only the innocents (the animals), and he intends for humanity to end with his family. Other factors conspire to complicate this scenario, and the endgame of the movie revolves around Noah's struggle with his own repressed guilt and loathing. He may ""walk with God,"" but he must go on a dark journey to find the goodness and spirituality that has been vouchsafed within him. In that sense, the movie is really about Noah's ""arc"" as much as it is about the building of a giant wooden vessel. If humanity is to be rebuilt on the earth, it must first be rebuilt in the soul. The performances by all the leads (Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone, Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins) are excellent, as are the costumes, production design and cinematography. Aronofsky regular, composer Clint Mansell, provides another beautifully rendered musical score, which adds that distinctive, otherworldly flavor one has come to expect from the collaboration between these two artists. The visual effects are both striking and well integrated while still allowing for some stunningly original set pieces. Given the film's budget, Aronofsky had the luxury of creating his ark full-size as an actual set, a choice which greatly aids in the believability of the action, both inside and out. Despite its mega-budget and big studio credentials, the movie is not a typical ""Hollywood"" production, but clearly the vision of the director and his inner circle of collaborators. As for the religious conservatives who have condemned the film (mostly sight unseen), it is a shame they remain imprisoned within their hermetically sealed beliefs and don't understand that the nature of enlightenment is the expansion of one's consciousness, not its confinement. Though an acknowledged atheist, the Jewish-born Aronofsky brings a strong spiritual dimension to all his films, and none more so than with Noah. By infusing the thin tale from Genesis with elements taken from Gnostic texts, the Kabbalah and other sources, the director creates a universal fable free from the shackles of dogma, which can appeal to anyone, regardless of their religious persuasion. Diversity is a strength. Be fruitful and multiply! There's more than one way to paint ""The Last Supper."" And cinematically speaking, there's more than one way to skin a cat, or to build a boat!",Noah

The minute I saw the rock watchers I was chastising myself for even being in the theater wasting my time watching a movie with this pathetic of a plot. I spend most of the rest of my viewing time hoping that the end would come quickly. The mood created by the special effects and the 'color' of the movie made one feel a dissonance and created a tone for the movie that was off putting. I never bought in to what they were selling. I was thankful that we viewed this at one of the local budget theaters so that we didn't waste a lot of money.

1003,CookiesSmuggler,Noah can be quite enjoyable if you take it as it is,7,14 April 2014,"I think a lot of people get into unnecessary religious debates because of this movie. What they don't get is that you can enjoy this movie and it doesn't matter if you believe in Bible or you consider it myth or work of fiction. Bible doesn't get too deep into exploring personality of Noah and his relationship with god. Did he guide him and helped in every aspect? I liked the idea that god just gave Noah notice that the flood is coming and it is basically up to him to figure the rest. As the movie shows it was not easy for him, because it is not really clear what is right and what is wrong. And it suddenly turns out that demarcation is not very obvious, Noah comes to conclusion that Noah's people are not principally better than the other (Cain's) people. Those people are disappointed that god left them, but Noah doesn't feel too much support from god as well and it makes him bitter. He finally makes a decision to spare the girls but he feels that he failed his mission and only some time after the water went away he is revealed that he actually did what was right. I liked this interpretation of the story (again doesn't matter if the original story is real or myth) because it shows how unobvious it is to choose good from bad by ourselves and that both present in each of us and it is matter of personal choice which path to follow.",Noah

Laughable special effects derivative of everything from 'The Never Ending Story' to 'Lord Of The Rings.' Weird costuming with obviously off-the-shelf modern parts. And way, way too long. Doesn't know whether it wants to be a biblical epic or a sci-fi movie, an deeply human journey or a cautionary tale, but manages to fail in all categories. My first and last Aronofsky movie.

For ones who ever heard for Bible, this movie has to be funny or offensive. Lets compare movie with Bible story. His name was Noah, his sons names are correct too, there was a big flood which kill so many people... and that is it. his sons have their wives with them, there wasn't any plot against anyone etc.Not so good acting, but what can you expect of Z movie. Plot has so many holes which has holes again. Watchers? Ilas (E.

Somo other moments you ask yourself if it is a comedy, but where are the jokes. Some times you think it would have psychological approach, but you didn't find any human point...then you think it would be a theological approach but you don't find the god point of view either. I think it had the idea but didn't find the time to mature it, neither had the time to make a better realization...not only in the technicality point of view (it is obvious it doesn't lack of resources) but in the internal coherence.

I can already see a large amount of judgmental dismissive attitudes writing short sighted emotional reviews that is to be anticipated with a controversial piece of art such as this. Kudos Aronofsky!I'm not sure what story people may have had in their minds before watching the film, but it has been very clear that it wasn't the raw perspective Aronofsky offered.Without going into detail let's not forget that this is a story about a man following god's will to kill off his own creation (cleansing?). Seems a bit odd with the omnipotent all-powerful god many people imagine, in this classic retelling of god's blunder...I hope this film achieves what it is aimed to do, to ensure that individuals who watch it have their preconceived notions of their belief system challenged, & that they don't lead themselves into religious extremism, which unfortunately we see all too often in this world.This is a great movie about love, compassion, and doing the right thing.",Noah
1008,christopherzelko,The Bible Gone Bad!,3,2 April 2014,"The film ""Noah"" was a 6 month waiting disappointment. After viewing numerous previews and expecting so much from an exceptional and academy award winning cast, I was greatly disturbed and bored at the decisions made by the writers and director. I believe the story of ""Noah's Ark"" is probably one of the most well known biblical stories and characters outside of ""Adam & Eve"" and ""Moses, and to mislead the public in ways of religion is a betrayal in itself. I will not spoil anything for anyone who whats to see this movie, so I will state some generic personal problems I had without giving anything away. The movie ""Noah"" combines both future and past time periods. A choice, I believe, directors choose to allow as much freedom as possible. However, it makes the movie very confusing for the audience to follow. I must also state that you must walk into the theater with a very open mind. Though it follows some of the biblical story, the movie ""Noah"" is about 1/4 biblical parable and 3/4 director's point of view such as, new characters introduced, suicidal tendencies erupting, carnivorous survival leading to the gates of hell, etc. The actors were exceptional in all ways and gave award winning performances. The main problem was the writing and direction. If you take a pro golfer and force him to only hit golf balls on a driving range for the rest of his life, that is the confinement I saw with the actors. Capable of so much more but only being allowed to show despair, depression, anger, and sadness. ""Noah"" needed to be about 45 minutes shorter but I must admit, I followed it and remained awake. It was entertaining but not worth the ticket price. I would recommend waiting to see it after it is released for television and DVD. The effects are not strong enough to make a person feel dissatisfied in missing this movie on the Big Screen.",Noah

The director couldn't even decide if this movie is a fantasy one or not. He managed to put MONSTERS on a biblical story. MONSTERS. I do not read the bible, but i'm pretty sure the book must be better.

What a warped version of the flood story. Terrible computer generation of animals and scenery, only remotely based on the Biblical story, terrible script, unbelievable unrealistic and goofy plots, and horrible performances by Crowe and Hopkins who mumbled their way through the movie with absolutely no personality. Looks like all they were interested in were making their house payments. I fell asleep 3/4 way thru it and my wife said she wished she had never started it. I rarely write a review as I can usually find something that redeems a movie even in a small way, but this movie was so bad it prompted action to do so. The producers should have taken the money it took to make this movie and given it to a charity so something good would have happened. What a waste.

There was a boat, and a flood, and a guy called Noah, but other than those elements there was little resemblance the the biblical account of Noah and the flood. Don't get me wrong, it was a great epic fantasy, but the inclusion of the biblical references were more to touch on people's recognition of cultural icons than to indicate the strength of Noah's faith. If you just want to see a big budget epic fantasy, its a good view, but don't go expecting anything which would promote the biblical representation of the flood and its purpose. If I believed the bible was no more than an epic storybook, I might give this moving a 9, but since I have a little more faith and think the rewrite misrepresented that faith, I'll give it 7.",Noah

After watching the trailer I supposed that it would be an awesome film that we could enjoy.Well, I was wrong.I remember the opening in ""Fargo"" (1996): ""THIS IS A TRUE STORY""; and a lot of movies presumable inspired by ""true events"". This is a really inaccurate film that should start with the opening: ""This is a film loosely-based on Noah"" or something like: ""FYI: This is not the Noah from Genesis"".Since the very beginning I noticed a lot of inconsistent details regarding to the TRUE story. One of the things that I found really disquieting is the change of the story about Noah and his family. Noah's wife and the three wives of his adult sons entered the ark. In the movie, only one son entered with his wife who is pregnant of two twin girls; who I supposed would became the wives of the other two sons, who are a couple of teenagers!I really like the Noah described in Genesis 6:8 ""The Lord was pleased with Noah""; and found very difficult to sympathize with Russell Crowe's character. Especially when my 7 year old daughter whispered ""Noah is a very mean man! Why does he want to kill the baby girls? Is he crazy dad?""How to rate this film? I gave it a 7 because of the top-notch cast: Again in the leading roles the couple Crowe-Connelly, a bit of Anthony Hopkins and a great performance of Emma Watson. The special effects are also great!In summary; if you have in mind to watch an accurate version of Noah you will be disappointed.

1018,cece_psiho,Great Film,10,6 July 2014,"This is my first review but i had to write it, because I think most of the reviews with low score are most misleading. In most of the bad reviews first was the complaint about lacking action from the flood itself and lack of animals shown in the film; Basically for them the movie was bad because they expected more carnage in the flood and more CGI moments/time with the animals. If this i Your expectation too - Stop reading this and Wait for the new Jurassic movie!!!First off all i consider myself an atheist so here goes my review for a movie inspired by a religious story.The setting and the scenery was great, I lowed the CG skies and the hills with poor vegetation which ware to represent depleted earth.The characters ware great to, they fulfill their purpose to the fullest in telling the story.Acting was great to; I only saw the actors for the first minute of their appearance and till the end I only saw the characters they were portraying.The story was great, I was surprised with the supernatural/magical elements in it, I did not expect that and I loved it. It had a steady pace and not a moment of mine was wasted. This was modern interpretation of a millennium old story with messages that should concerns us every day. And a story of a strong willed, brave and kind man.There ware couple of scenes that ware strange and I liked them a lot.First one : There was a creature that in one scene was made to move like in the old movies, like it was stop-shot animation of a dummy monster in old productions and yet later on it moved with smooth dynamics.The second one was a scene where solders were caring very distinctive peaces of metal as a shield, It was a modern roofing S shaped tin.I don't know why they made those scenes I just hope it was for trolling the people who did not care for a story and went just to watch the carnage of the flood and saber tooth tigers :D.If you like inspiring stories watch it, no mater to witch divinity you bow and respect, this is a story of humans, it has nothing to do with churches and politics.",Noah

I do not know if it is Christians not supporting this adaptation, or if it is atheists thinking it is way to much Christian propaganda. I am a atheist, and I like good stories on the screen. What I liked about this movie was that feeling of adventure the likes of LOTR and Star Wars, a movie adaptation of a biblical story that is up there with other science fiction and adventure films. It didn't make the story about Noah more plausible, but it was a great story, set in timeless environments. I have read the genesis story even though I'm not a Christian, and in my opinion this adaptation is quite accurate and true to the biblical story, with some tweaking here and there. A little gnostic view points here and there, but all in all something fresh made from a old and boring book, made a little bit more interesting.

Not being 100% biblically correct. 2. Being a story from the bible. Considering this it seems Darren has done a good job of coming up with his own envisioned compromise, almost bridging the two sides but not making an alliance with either. It's an exaggerated story with a touch of fantasy and added plot lines to interest a somewhat neutral viewer (not Christian or atheist) at the expense of possibly upsetting strong believers. Technically it's a good film from a great director tied together with powerful imagery, I'm still letting it sink in. I think a lot of scenes capture the moment, which really helps transport you from the theater into the story. There's not really any complaints, it was a solid film all round, great acting, good score that didn't distract and beautiful landscapes.

Of course the story is fictional mythology anyway, but this movie was even more of a fantasy, having rock creatures that looked like transformers, They are giving only one of Noah's sons a wife, when the Bible says Noah and his 3 sons all had their wives with them.

1026,zoszsoz,"One of the worst movies of all time, yes _all time_",1,16 April 2014,"I think the only real review of the movie worth reading would be this one: answersingenesis.org/articles/noah-movie/detailed-reviewWhat we've got here is a movie that took the basic idea of the bible story like ""flood"", ""everybody dies"", ""animals on an ark"" and ""Noah"" then made up the rest of the story to suit the writer/director's agenda.It is interesting to note that it is by an atheist director and writer. I wonder if their objective was to mock the biblical story, because if so they did a solid job.* The movie pushes evolution in a big way. Supposedly a explosion/big bang creates the universe, next thing we see is a fish which then crawls up on the shore, turns into a lizard, then turns into a monkey then the screen flashes and Adam and Eve appear. So that leaves the viewer wondering well what did The Creator actually do then? * For the movie to only allow one of the son's wives on the ark instead of each son having a wife on the ark (as was written in the bible), this infers the rest of the human race was created from incest between the uncles & nieces or between the born brother's and sisters. Good way to twist the story and make bible followers appear crazy. The biblical story would have allowed for the procreation between cousins and so on, which is not really ""incest"", not illegal and actually still occurs around the world in some cultures.* Weird rock angels helping build the ark. This is complete fantasy. Nowhere near biblical at all. Also these ""fallen angels"" or really you could call them by their real name, demons, supposedly help mankind which is another good way to twist the story of the bible.* Too much magical and mystical stuff going on. The forest that sprouted up to conveniently produce trees and water from a barren land appeared from a magic seed given by the grandfather. It didn't come from The Creator in the movie. Also the grandfather can induce dreams or hallucinations and this is where Noah gets his vague idea to build the ark. In the bible Noah receives clear instructions about how to build it, not vague hallucinations induced by a grandfather.* The stupidest part of the movie is where Noah gets the idea to save the animals only but the human race must die off. So when he's on the boat he feels the need to kill his new granddaughters to make sure the human race dies with them. Well why didn't you just leave all your family to die in the flood then? Why take any of them on the ark at all? Because once you get off the ark and let the animals off, all you're going to do is die anyway. In the bible it says the purpose of the ark was to cleanse the world of sin and corruption. Noah and his family who were righteous found grace and favor with God were to live, procreate and continue the human race.* The character assassination of Noah. The movie makes him out to be psychopathic murderer and killer. He killed many people in the movie. This is not what happened in the bible at all.I really think the aim of this movie was to trick Christians worldwide into seeing the movie and take their hard earned money and watch a pro-atheism film, perhaps even to confuse them about their religion so they might switch to atheism. Judging by how many have already seen it there's probably several million dollars wasted already and that money could have been better spent going to World Vision to help poor people in starving communities in Africa or South Ameria.I for one am boycotting anything from this absolutely useless director and writer in future and you should too.

However, it does have a very powerful message. I love the story of Noah in the bible. And yes I was a little let down with the inaccuracies, what Christians and viewers have to do though is stop putting God in a box. If you allow yourself to come with an open mind you see a story about a man that loves God and his family and the creatures of the world. You are able to see how God provides for Noah and his family throughout the entire movie. People freak out and curse the movie when Noah says to his family that it would be better if they were all dead, try and see it through his eyes. We don't always get what God wants exactly because we are human. If this man thought that it would be better if the world was without man and sin, that is a man that is truly dedicated to his God. He realizes the grace of God later in the movie and understands. This movie gives an idea of how Noah might have been in that time, emotionally you would have to be hardened and probably a little mean. It's not that Noah wanted to keep people off the boat or let the entire race of man be destroyed, it's that God had to because man was so wicked. So if people could get past their own pride and their box view of everything they would see a remarkable story about a family man that loves his God and understands the task of making the ark. It's a remarkable story about God's grace and how he provides for us. See this movie with an open mind and understand that it was written by Hollywood and INSPIRED by the bible.

Even Anthony Hopkins's cameo as Obiwan Methuselah (use the seed, Noah) can't rescue this piece of celluloid crap.

I enjoyed the way in which they showed how Noah as a human being suffers the flooding of the earth, and how it hurts him both psychologically and physically. The musical score of the movie was beautiful, and the way it makes you talk about what you've seen, and question how life on earth is so precious, and how humanity itself has become so corruptible makes this one of the best movies that I have ever seen. a definite 10/10 I can't wait for this to come out on Friday! :)",Noah

The writers, directors, and producers of this movie should feel ashamed. The previews for this movie were absolutely misleading. One minute we have a good Noah. Then he becomes Kung-Fu killer Noah. Then He Becomes Kill Off your family line Noah. Then becomes Drunk Naked Noah. Then he becomes good Noah again? This had more J.J.R. Tolkien feel to it than a biblical story. Don't get me wrong I love J.R.R. Tolkien but this movie was completely ridiculous on so many levels. What a waste of 2 hours of my my life. I wish I could have my $20 bucks back. Don't waste your time folks, don't see it in theatres or on video.",Noah

You will see it as soon as the story begins. Kind of gore, I don't know if I would call it realistic but more blood than expected. Still I would not be comfortable having little kids watching it. No sex scenes, one insinuated though. Good as a weekend movie, not exceptional. Good special effects, except on one of the scenes where one of the Guardians (You'll know when you see it what I mean) is against the sunset light and looked like more like the Iron Giant than a superbeing. I would be really disappointed if it is nominated for any award. So, it is watchable but won't keep you on the edge of your seat.",Noah

Come on people, being a Christian doesn't mean you go around telling negative stuff about everything that's not perfectly biblical. For people who haven't seen this film I highly recommend every single person to go watch this beautiful film, but with an open mind not as a closed minded stubborn person. Every aspect of this film was perfect, cinematography, the editing, the acting (Jennifer Connelly & Emma Watson in particular), direction, screenplay, visuals all were top notch. The only thing that disappointed me a bit were ""The Watchers"" but as I think about it more and more I think bringing The Watchers added a little sense to the film. Darren Amazing job!!

Why even put the title Noah on this when the movie has almost no basis on what is written in the Bible? Even if you aren't a Christian this movie is terrible and not entertaining. I'd urge Christians to not take your children to see this as it has nothing to do with what is written in God's Word. The TV series on the Bible was done by Christians and was excellent...I guess I was hoping for something similar. This could have been an inspiring, wonderful movie showing the majesty of God, the sinfulness of man without Him and that there is judgment for sin. Instead, it has rock creatures, a magic grandpa, and they made Noah borderline psychotic.

1037,Teectac,139 minutes of pure Hell with a capital H.,1,4 April 2014,"139 minutes of pure Hell...I went in with an open mind thinking : hey it's 2014 let's see what they can do with good old Noah's story.Boy oh boy...I feel like some deceitful being used my faith against me to con me out of 139 minutes of my life and the price of a movie ticket. I should have left but I wanted to know exactly what I would be talking about when I would tell others. My advice: if you're of Judeo-Christian faith don't bother..If you're an atheist or believes in something different : wait for it to be on TV.It's one thing to take liberties with a story you want to put in a movie, it's another to purposely depict the opposite of the original story. The director of this movie did the latter.Whoever is described in the Bible as evil is now good in the movie and whoever is good is now evil : Noah is now evil and condemned to die while a bunch of demons (fallen angels) are now good creatures who only want to serve God by building his ark and who get to be forgiven and they are allowed back in heaven...Mind you, those demons blame mankind for their fate and play the victims. How sociopathic ! Now according to them, the only reason they were cast out of heaven is because they were trying to cover up for men who had rebelled against God and eaten the fruit. Poor Demons?...I don't think so...Whatever was done by God in the Bible is now done by nature or by men in the movie. God is totally left out of the script for the most part. The movie's Noah's version of the genesis kind of goes something like this: God created light and then sat back and watched as the big bang theory occurred and then darwinism took place with all the organisms turning into fish jumping out of water transforming into mammals... then He came back from His break to design Adam and Eve...Another way God is left out of the picture is when the movie's Noah goes to his grandpa for everything and the rest of the family too.Yes grandpa got super powers. Mind you, grandpa's been hanging out with demons(fallen angels) for so long, he has mastered some kind of esoteric knowledge and super powers. Oh and they also have a tradition of passing down the serpent skin of Satan from generation to generation...I guess that too would give somebody some type of super natural power... It's very useful because then you don't have to pray to God for anything, because grandpa will take care of it, just ask grandpa and he will provide, not God.Grandpa will fight the mean descendants of Cain with the help of the demons for you... God hasn't contacted you in a while? Grandpa will make you the magic tea that helps you channel God's visions...Did God forget about the wood for the ark? Grandpa will give you the magic seed that will make the forest grow so you can build the ark...Forget what God has supposedly in mind( which again is totally ludicrous in the movie)who cares if God only provided a barren woman cause he supposedly wants mankind to disappear forever...grandpa will make the barren woman fertile again...he will make it all better for you.In the Bible Noah receives his instructions directly from God, but the God who's in this movie a.k.a "" the creator""... stops interacting with Noah about 35 min into the movie (I guess He is on another break like the one He took during the genesis) so since the visions have disappeared... Noah just wings it : God wants 3 wives for my 3 sons.. no wait... He doesn't...God wants only me and my family on the ark..no wait..He allowed the big villain in the ark too...God wants me to kill the twins...no wait...maybe not......Ugh... the whole movie is just exhausting...",Noah

1040,sbacm,Noah - an excellent bible based story,10,29 March 2014,"The movie Noah: This is the best biblical based film since Passion of the Christ, and the benchmark movies produced from Christian metaphorical literature: Lord of the Rings and Narnia. These were wonderful award winning successful films in the modern era; stories finally portrayed with great technical quality that touched millions of people. The film Noah suggests another biblical epic, and it was - gritty and real. In reading Genesis chapters 3-9, it is clear there are certainly a few biblical inaccuracies in the film, but I don't think it matters in this creative piece. In its overall intent, the metaphors, the story, the acting, the amazing sets and locations honors the scriptural story. The biblically accurate content, far out-weighs anything negative that is being held against the movie. I understand that many Christians and non-believers alike have attacked the film. Either criticizing with no biblical reference whatsoever, or from an over-idealized perspective of what a 'biblical film' should be, which is subjective to say the least. Christendom seems to expect that bible-based films should be 100% biblically accurate ALL the time - to then be 'approved' as a 'legitimate project'; as a Christian, and as a creative, I contest that notion. For example: there is much negative comment about the 'watchers' that protected Noah in the film that it's all 'just fantasy'. In Genesis chapter 6, it speaks of the 'sons of God' sleeping with the daughters of men (verse 2), which in theological debate are said as fallen angels, and there were also giants on the earth at that time (verse 4). There's your massive rock men right there. Biblically accurate? Yes... but creatively interpreted in the context of story, and entertaining in the action and drama of it all. From a culture point of view, the 'watchers' were also an obvious inter-textual reference to another great Christian metaphorical story, Lord of the Rings, where the Ents (tree men) fought Saruman (evil) and helped the hobbits (good). The 'watchers' in Noah even had similar voices to the Ents, this is clever in a modern cultural context, as a film-goer can relate to it. Noah is a film - it's entertaining, and visually intriguing to watch. Scripture is clear - angels were created and given to man to minister to, and help. People can get hung up on their pre-conceived ideas of an angel, but Aronofsky has made a good screenplay using biblical truth. Actor Russell Crowe portrays very well Noah's struggle with his own humanity and imperfect nature. The paradox is that the man Noah is referenced in scripture as 'perfect' finding grace with God, but then scripture says in Genesis 6:12 that ALL flesh is corrupt – which includes Noah and his family, Psalm 14:1-3 and Romans 3:23 make it clear that NO ONE does good and all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Several times in the film the character Noah said, 'I can't do this' - the man is stressed! No wonder he planted a vineyard and got drunk when he got off the boat (Genesis 9:21), he was 600 years old, and had 100 years of stress in building an ark preparing for his world to end! Biblically Ham's relationship with Noah was also not good especially after seeing him naked (the strained relationship was well portrayed in the film). The metaphor of the narcissistic king (with his own god complex), being on the ark (even though not biblically true), is just another picture of the snake of temptation toward Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The continuing temptation of evil was being portrayed on the boat as the king, still alive, despite the grace on Noah and his family. It shows that evil is still in the hearts of men (as we know from history), and Ham is the obvious foil of choice for the king to tempt in the film. And even that same king had his struggle with God shown in his character, wanting God to be there and to answer his cries – won't many relate to that? This film is about redemption. Beautifully portrayed in the twin baby girls of Emma Watson's character. She and her twins embody the three wives of Noah's sons as shown in scripture, but just brought about in a creative way in the film. This allowed for Noah at the end of the film, to put away the 'knife of his fallen humanity', and kiss the babies, instead of killing them in his fog of human judgment. This mirrors the story of Abraham, who was about to kill his son Isaac on the altar of sacrifice, and then a miracle lamb was provided by God, Noah's kiss on his grand daughters was the metaphorical 'lamb provided'. The love is in the kiss, this redemptive quality is played out well in the screenplay and onward to the final message of love and mercy for our world, in a new start, strengthened with the eternal covenant of God and His grace toward men, represented in the final scene with the rainbow. This is an immensely creative film, telling a great story, bringing a wonderful message; in this case being theologically, artistically, and intellectually stimulating. The irony for me is that Darren Aronofsky is apparently an atheist, yet he has produced a film that perhaps even bible believers could not have made in their pre-conceived idealism of how bible films should be. At the end of the Hoyts movie session when we saw the film, everybody was still seated; you could hear their minds whirring, asking questions, chatting and debating points of the film. This film will create many points of debate on a theological, intellectual and emotional level, and that is why it will be one of the greats in the biblical movie canon.

1041,anto_eee,"Director stuck between Visual attraction and Main plot, resulted in a Long & Boring Movie",5,30 March 2014,"Even after founding the mixed reviews, I went to this film trusting Director's reputation. The talent he proved in Black Swan, Fountain & Requiem of Dream in which he builds the characters and connects their feelings and emotions with the viewers, there he succeeds by keeping viewers stay connected till the end of the movie.But in Noah, he got stuck between the challenge he got to give viewers a visual treat and the main plot. He was not able to successfully connect with viewers the emotions & struggles of Noah and also the supporting characters caught up between reality and belief, even with such talented star cast. The connection of Noah-Creator was totally absent (like, why Noah is been chosen and why he feels the dream are words from Creator). Also the love for his family is not portrayed well enough so that we could feel the emotional struggle faced by Noah between the love & duty. Director had left all that for us to assume since we already knew the story and heard many a times. The grand picturization of the Arc, Action Scenes, etc ate too much time which shows the struggle in screenplay, in an attempt to balance the best he could achieve. None the less its a choice made by the director to concentrate more in visual attraction than his best attribute of main plot which ultimately left the viewers struggling to get connect or interested in the film. Bottom line, Director chose a good plot (emotional struggles of good hearted person to go through worse, he can ever imagine in the name of duty imposed by Creator)with very competent cast but to give a slow, boring and uninteresting 2 hrs 15 mins.The good thing is the cast... Russell, Jennifer, Anthony & Emma did their best to make the movie interesting... But guys I had gone through a suffocating 2 hrs 15 mins.",Noah

That's the first time I considered doing so in 15 years. I would have but my wife wanted to stay and later regretted it. It has nothing to do with the bible, and the plot and ideas added to the Noah script are complete nonsense. It seems the directors/writers wanted to write in anything they could to show contempt for the Genesis story. Even without that, the movie is confusing, disjointed crap nonsense that makes you often ask why? What the heck was that? The ads as have been noted elsewhere did not depict the utter nonsense of the film as regards the CGI and Noah's warped character, but made you believe that the biblical Noah and his story might be displayed. That had to be intentional. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE unless you love nonsense and confusion with weak acting.",Noah

Darren Aronofsky created this movie based on his concept of Noah, which if I may venture, was a very uncommon concept. Anyone who also felt Noah was a dark, remorseful character, or those who have never read the story of Noah or learned anything about him and others of the Old Testament patriarchs including Methuselah, will likely sympathize with this movie. As for me and everyone I know, we found Noah to be a wise, obedient, powerful prophet of the old testament and so it was painful to see him depicted as a cold, empty, blindly obedient puppet like this movie portrayed him.

It's a combination of ""The Temptations of Christ"" meets ""Lord of the Rings."" After I saw it, I listened to many at the theater complain how it wasn't like the Bible. I laughed...and added, ""it's not a documentary, it's a Hollywood movie!"" It isn't like the Bible story of Noah PER SE, but touches on their ideas. As far as the movie goes...I loved it. Great action and a good cast. I love Emma Watson and I thought she did a fantastic performance as Ila. She really made me feel like she was suffering from the assassination of her children. Russel Crowe gave a great performance as well. Who doesn't love Jennifer Connelly? Jennifer and Emma without their make-up...shown their natural beauty! Anthony Hopkins was perfect as Methuselah.

1046,pbb58,Very disappointing!,1,17 November 2014,"I admit to being a person who is prone to prejudging a movie based on who's in it. When I saw the big name actors in this version of the Noah story, I assumed it would be great......but alas, I couldn't have been more wrong. I seriously don't know where to start....so much wrong with this film. It is just an unabashed attempt to turn a biblical tale with a message of redemption into a Hollywood action flick with scant regard for the truth. They took a well known biblical tale and added a good dollop of Hollywood crap and nonsense and made it into a blockbuster, including so many fictitious and magical elements as to render the whole point of the story meaningless and in fact telling a different story altogether. I know a movie is to some extent a work of fiction and entertainment but when you take a well known biblical account surely there's an innate requirement to display some faithfulness to the period and to the original story but the ridiculously out of sync costuming and weaponry held by the characters who are in a setting that would have to be thousands of years BC....iron armour? Welding mask??? It looked for all the world like some pseudo medieval myth and magic tale of no set period, not a biblical story from the bronze age. Theologically it was a disaster. The screen play appears to have been written by someone with no clear understanding of the point of the story at all and hell bent on making it a visually spectacular action flick.It gives a message of a vengeful God that wants to punish humanity, not the God of love that shines through the Bible at all. I sincerely hope no-one decides to base their faith life on what this movie portrays as God. Where did the fallen angels come from? I wasn't aware of that part of the story and why were they made to look like stone transformers? I could go on and on but the word limit prevents me......I sum up by saying that it was an expensive piece of crap, but I guess it made everyone a lot of money. :)",Noah

Nice special effect - and it's in the Bible. Most show the rain but not the ""fountains of the deep"".This should not be added to a library of bible based movies.Granted, not all Bible based films are, but this movie seemed to ignore any of the details of the Bible.

1048,GergelyABella,Who on Earth said this was a Christian movie?,8,12 April 2014,"First things first, this movie has absolutely nothing - I repeat, nothing - to do with the Bible, nor Christianity, nor anything related to this or that religion. Noah is a very good film, not perfect, not faultless, but still very good. I am convinced that the poor ratings and bashing reviews came from those who had the misconception that Aronofsky would make an adaptation of the Bible. Folks, Aronofksy doesn't do adaptations, so Noah is not an adaptation, however Aronofsky does do psychological movies and boy, Noah is one alright. That being said, the audience has to see that Noah is not for everyone. Avid Christians, atheists, and realistic psycho-movie fans should avoid Noah. This film is for the thinkers. Everybody else would either find it dumb or insulting. Now, relating to the movie itself, Aronofsky used elements from a dozen of mythologies (yes, also from Christian mythology) and built up a fantasy world which serves as the setting. As this is not too usual for Aronofsky some might find it hard to swallow. The plot is fairly simple: what happens to the psyche of a chosen man? What happens to the minds of those who have to make grave decisions? How don't messiahs go mad? It has to be admitted, that Noah's fantasy world (complete with the Creator, descendants of Seth and Cain, and the rock-Ent angel-Guardians) requires tolerance, even more so since the whole point of Aronofsky's movies are never said out aloud and the audience has to work these out; but we still get the Aronofsky-style psychodrama. Acting-wise, Crowe and Connelly are great in their respective roles, as is Hopkins and Winstone. The weak links are Lerman and Watson, however we have to realise that Lerman's character didn't have enough depth (Ham 's only role was to be angry at Noah for not letting him have a wife) and that Watson's character was a very difficult one to play. I personally think this was Miss Watson's best performance as of yet, she is convincing, but not as good as the rest of the cast. The visuals are good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The storytelling,on the other hand, is quite special. The continuity of the movie is disrupted from time to time either by singing, animation or a black screen (with or without narration). The storytelling is very similar to how Bertolt Brecht's theatre pieces work. Still, however strange it is, it works and I sincerely doubt that the conventional linear storytelling would have done anything good. All in all, Noah is good movie, but if you decide to go and watch it be sure that you wan to watch it for all the good reasons.",Noah
1049,armlordharut,Matter of Choice,8,20 July 2014,"All this movie is about a man and how he struggles through the world, the choices he makes, actions that he act. If we go beyond of its title, the ideology that should be in this movie, all things that should lead us through the story of the Biblical character Noah, then we will get a movie in a very Aronofsky style. All those contrasting in characters, pushing their boundaries, self-development of each character, is common in his other movies. There were couple of things that Aronofsky contrasted here.Man, all alone in a cruel world. Noah, is a simple man, like every one else, and he lives in world that does not support and help him. He is all alone, fighting for his family, struggling in his self-loneliness. All the way he desires a help. But he refuses to receive it from a family of his own. A typical character of a man, who will rather die on horse with a sword in his hands, than show his family that he is weak. But why the world around him is cruel, because they does not share his ideology. He is common with every other husband that lived in his land, he killed like they do, he had children like every other one. But for him, he was fighting his demons inside, not to go mad. The loneliness that is characterized by the lack of people who are sharing exact same ideology, just puts oil on a fire. World for him was cruel as he refused to accept them, their way of life, their way thinking, everything.Moment of choice. A person described in above, is one of those who rather die than accept anything that is out of their boundaries. Each time when Noah was making a choice, he knew that there is always a point of return. Those were not a real decisions. The real decision comes when it should, when the world that he knew is getting to crunch. In those moments a person like Noah's character, gets a slap in the face. As he should make a choice, he should choose either to evolve, or act the he used to. Those are real moments of choice. Such moments lives a scars on heart of a man, and takes the serenity away, as in both cases Noah should live without understanding the difference between his past and present.A random person. After a moment of choice, there is still exist a randomness in Noah's life. As there still existed a random person. A very random person, once met, with no reason, with no clues, is person equal to saving belt. Such people are not overwhelmed with our past, our historical ideology that we are forced to accept. They do appear at our least and most wanted moments. And they bring a serenity back to our life, like that happened with Noah. They help us understand the difference between our past and present.",Noah
1050,momsofia,This Catholic loved it!,8,29 March 2014,"I'm a big fan of Aronofsky's work, and he did not fail to disappoint in Noah. This film is very imaginative, the acting was superb, and it does stick to the basic plot line of the bible story. ""Noah"" did add some elements that are never mentioned in the bible or relevant for the time, BUT those additions or slight deviations still kept the spirit of the message in tact. Without revealing the plot twist (which may anger some Christians- I know I myself was cringing at first), I liked the interpretation that Ila (Emma Watson's character) expressed, that God had placed the decision in Noah's hands as to whether or not mankind would continue or die out with his family. This film really brings to the forefront sin, judgment, compassion and the magnitude of Free Will. I recommend going to see this film with an open mind, an appreciation for Aronofsky's creative genius, and an understanding that this is NOT a documentary but rather an artistic and dramatic expression that manages to keep the main plot, spirit, and doctrines outlined within the biblical narrative.",Noah

A battle with Tubal-Cain and his people? well okay, I can accept that the people who did not get on the Ark didn't want to just lay down and die, so I won't really pick that fight; there is a heavy Hollywood environmentalist spin with many examples in this movie. I do believe I saw quite a few subtly and not so subtly injected Illuminati symbols. honest. But seriously, they're in almost every high-budget Hollywood movie anyway.... there are some pretty creepy ""historical revisionist"" twists in this movie's overall design, script and visual presentation, but I guess if this movie interests anyone in reading the real story...

This is why I was looking forward to Noah, to let myself be in the mind of Noah. And while he doesn't manage to do this in the same captivating way he has done in the past it's not a far way of. I was able to feel Noahs doubts and it was an interesting journey to madness as Aranofskys work often is.Aside from this I don't have much to say about the stone giants, how true it is to the bible etc, Those are just things surrounding the story of Noahs journey and I don't mind them.

I am not a Christian and i have not read the bible, and no matter what most people say i like this version of Noah's story. The movie is more geared towards drama and does not rely on emphatic action sequences.Coming to the acting, it was an average performance from Rusell Crowe's standards, partly because of a weak script. Everyone else however, managed a good performance in whatever little role they had. The special effects were not impressive, it all looks a decade old. The CG effects were not very convincing and the in some scenes quite cheap, i wonder if they ran out of money.Although i am a big fan of Darren Aronofsky and have seen all of his movies, this movie failed to live up to my expectations. The direction was perfect but the movie as a whole failed to deliver.Verdict: I would recommend you watch it but do not expect to be blown away.",Noah

1055,brunocool07,More powerful than Ambien,2,10 November 2014,"I had no expectation at all about that movie; just wanted to kill some time watching a simple Hollywood blockbuster. I tried to fight, to keep my eyes open but I was fighting a too strong enemy named ""Noah"": it killed me. After maybe 30 minutes I just fall asleep in the vertical position. Since that day , Noah is an inside-joke with my unlucky friend who saw that movie with me, we say a lot of times when we gonna finish to watch that movie. There's nothing to tell about the storyline, it's just nothing and a bit ridiculous. In fact, watch it's a movie to watch if you want to find sleep on a natural way and I'm not even kidding.",Noah

I can't find any bad side to this movie except that it will get you too emotional.",Noah
1057,genyus-368-930765,"No, no, Noah",2,15 April 2014,"I've been an IMDb lurker for several years and this film was so poor that I felt motivated to write my first-ever review. It's bad on so many levels, I'm not even quite sure where to begin...Storyline: This film probably represents the biggest rick-roll I've ever seen. Naturally, when people see a film about a great flood, titled Noah, the automatic assumption is that it's a re-telling of the biblical story. This film cynically exploits that expectation and then drops a hammer on the bewildered audience. I believe most people who watch this film will recognise that something is deeply ""wrong"" in it's portrayal, but they're less likely to realise that the fundamental reason is because the director has flooded (pun intended) his movie with imagery and references based not in Christian theology, but Gnostic mysticism. I'm not Christian, so I wasn't offended by this perspective on a theological level, but that didn't lessen my disappointment on a cinematic level at all. Special effects: Wow. Just... Wow. The effects in this film wouldn't look out of place in Jason and the Argonauts, or The Golden Voyage of Sinbad. If you're not familiar with either of these (much better) movies, it's possibly because you weren't born when they were produced, way back in the 60's and 70's. In any case, it saddens me to know that in 2014, effects of this standard are deemed acceptable for general release. But as soon as I finish this review, I'll be dusting off my Magnavox for a quick game of Wipeout just to complete the sensation of time-travel.Acting: This film sports a strong cast with some of my favourite actors and most of them discharge their duties as well as might be expected given the script they're stuck with. I did feel there was some overacting with some of the more emotionally loaded scenes, but overall, I'm more disappointed with the cast for accepting their roles than how they actually played them.Conclusion: Dear reader, I implore you. Go for a walk. Read a book. Call that friend you haven't caught up with for ages. Do anything but watch this film. I didn't pay to watch this mockery, but I still feel cheated. My OH slept through most of it and I feel jealous. If you avoid it altogether after reading this and other reviews, then I can at least feel like I've done my good deed for the day.",Noah

1060,noahfab,Mixes Clichés with Originality in this Interesting Sort of Way,7,14 April 2014,"Do not take my word for this review. Do not take anyone's word for any review of any film. They are all personal opinions on a very subjective standpoint. But this is my humble opinion on a film which shares my name. I'll be honest, the only reason I really went to see Noah is because that's my name and I was curious, sort of. Then I saw all the poor reviews the film's getting here and I was a bit sad, to be honest. It's a shame people can't understand that this is just an interpretation, one man's vision of how he sees the story. You don't see it that way? No problem. We all have a right to express our opinions. Anyway! I must say, I'm pleased and not with the film. It clearly wants to try and break with the Hollywood norm, but there's things in there that are just predictable Hollywood clichés, unfortunately. Spoiler Alert -- ""All I saw was Love,"" Noah says of his sparing of Ila's girls. That's a line I thought writers (Hollywood or otherwise) had gotten over. The Watcher's voices, again I've heard that kind of voice in just about every science fiction film. It really is about time we thought of something new. That said, voices aside, the concept of the Watchers being literally beings of Earth -- mud and rock -- is quite original, and of course the new imagining of the ark is too. Then there's the fantastic dream/vision sequences which are very well imagined and worked out. I also noted the fact that the film was shot in 1.85:1 as opposed to the more standard 2.35:1 aspect ratio usually used for this sort of film. I like this as it gives the film a sort of more intimate feel and somehow manages to give the landscape a lower priority to the more important character journey. OK, that sentence was a cliché itself. Sorry! Anyways, overall I think the film deserves a bit more positive remarks, even though it does have its faults. But nobody's perfect, so there you go. Oh, and more thing: not boring. I think that's quite enough.",Noah
1061,p-j-super-man,an interesting biblical interpretation,7,5 August 2014,"before the appearance of the angels refereed to as the ""watchers"" which are pretty awesome. You will become painfully aware of the sort of take they are going for on what is in the bible when you hear Noah refer to GOD only as ""the creator"".Though at one part it seemed sort of like Emma Watson had been laughing too much to properly play her role, the acting/ characters played were pretty nice.Keeping in mind the Bible has very interesting descriptions of Angles if taken literally: (His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude)-- only description of one angle with other bits saying angels aren't all the same.so if you know about this stuff, nothing is wholly contradictory in this movie. Though it does get a bit too ridiculous/hilarious.",Noah
1062,Beccamar88,Noah Needs a Snickers,3,29 November 2014,"You're not you when you're hungry... and you're most certainly not you when the writers of a film bearing your name as its title decide to rewrite you from biblical hero to psychopathic danger.Now I'm not saying that I'm against Bible story movie adaptations. I'm just saying that this movie did it poorly. Rock monsters passed off as angels built the ark? Don't remember that part in the original story. Noah going insane and trying to kill newborns? Definitely not close to the story.As a stand-alone story without reference to the Bible, this movie would have been a lot better. It was VERY loosely based on the original story and it shows. What really didn't do it for me was that they still tried to draw a link between the two.I went into this movie with somewhat high hopes. Russell Crowe, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Anthony Hopkins... They usually deliver. But I guess actors can only go so far with a script and plot like this.The visuals were pretty fun to see, and I admit, the cinematography was fairly great, but it just couldn't compensate for what the writers had created.",Noah
1063,adagiodance,"An epic tale, powerfully told by director and cast. Give it a chance.",10,27 April 2014,"I admit that I have special interest in this movie, as my daughter is in it. Even if she weren't, however, I would stand by Noah 100%. I have seen it three times now, the first at the premiere, where I was overwhelmed with anticipation and excitement. The second at our hometown premiere, overwhelmed with excitement still, but distracted wondering if our friends and family were enjoying it. I just came back from seeing it a third time, this time all alone... and I truly believe that it is an excellent film. Many people will love it, many will hate it, many won't even give it a chance, which is a shame.Note: Contains Spoilers!The story of Noah is powerful, and beautifully told by Darren Aronofsky and the entire cast. It is based on the graphic novel written for this film, and yes, the biblical story of Noah. However, it is a fictional story, and not intended to be completely word for word from the bible. Russell Crowe brilliantly takes on the complex role of Noah. He is incredibly powerful in conveying his love for his family, his commitment to living a peaceful life in harmony with the earth, and his struggle to follow the devastating tasks given to him by the Creator. Jennifer Connelly, as Naameh, is a loving mother and wife, who gives her all to protect the ones she loves. Emma Watson is wonderful as Ila, and makes us feel her struggle between her love for Shem and giving him up so that he can live a full life with a family. The entire cast made me feel something. The story and cinematography were powerful and intense. I have heard questions and criticism of the story from people who didn't understand it. If you are really watching and listening to the film, you will see and hear all of the hows and whys of the story - and all of your questions would be answered. Some questions I have heard: (NOTE - May contain spoilers): Why is man punished by the Creator? Man's behavior is explained several times throughout, including Noah's telling of the creation of the world to his family on the ark. They took the knowledge that the Watchers gave to them, and used it to corrupt the earth and mankind. What are the Watchers and why are they rock? Their story is explained to Noah and his family on the way to Methuselah's mountain. Why was Noah drunk on the beach? That is in the bible, and tied into the story wonderfully, as Noah's devastation after all he had to do and his inability to carry out the task, not to mention having his family torn apart. Wouldn't you be driven to madness and devastation if you had gone through all of that? Why did Ham leave? He felt like he didn't belong - throughout the entire story he questioned Noah and why they lived the way they did. Tubal Cain contributed to his confusion.I could go on, however I will just urge you to see for yourself and form your own opinion. If you've seen it once and are unsure about it, try seeing it again. It gets better every time. Watch it without the hype and the religious controversy clouding your judgement. Not everyone is going to agree - everyone has their own taste. I just truly believe that this film is excellent, and deserves more positive reviews. Give it a real chance. If you like it, come back and give it a good review.",Noah

The movie looked like a child's video game.. Glad it was free or I would have been upset that I paid to watch such trash.Mythical creatures, and a ""creator"" .

Its unlike any movie of this genre ever done before.But the large amount of negative reviews that has been surrounding this movie is mainly because of people's preconceived interpretation of something which they think is right or their belief/idea of something which they are not ready to alter(even for a movie). I found this same kind of issue with Zero Dark Thirty, which is common for political, religious movies anyways.But giving this movie anything below 7.0/10(I am too generous BTW) is just unimaginable considering its direction, writing, acting, scintillating music(Clint Mansell), cinematography or visual effects.A movie of this scale and that too from Darren Aronofsky, I bet you will miss a true cinematic experience for sure if you chose to skip this one. So open up your minds and give it a shot, I am damn sure this movie will stay with you long after you leave the theaters.",Noah
1067,kensphysique,Shame on all you haters!,10,26 April 2014,"I am hoping my review will be helpful from a filmmaking perspective and not based on historical inaccuracies that may be in the film. First off, it is ridiculous the amount of negativity circulating on IMDb and the internet about Noah. I mean, did these people not sit through the entire film? Clearly the they didn't understand the overall message--to spread love and not hate. I admire Darren Aronofsky and his background in animation. I think having experience in that medium truly strengthens your story telling skills. That is evident in all his writing, and in my opinion, both Aronofsky and Handel wrote an amazing story that is character driven and filled with meaningful sub plots. The story arc (no pun intended) builds slowly with underlying tension in every scene. From a technical standpoint, I appreciated the artistic qualities of the close up, shallow depth of field juxtaposed with wide angles. It really forced me to be in the moment with the scene and feel empathy for the characters. Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable together, to the point where it almost made me uncomfortable seeing them struggle. Their relationship with their children was also believable. Tubal-Cain played by Ray Winstone was a magnificent and very dark role. He made it easy for me to want the rain to come. At one point I hated Noah (Russell Crowe) for a decision he made, but that made his character more 3 Dimensional because the story does come full circle. It left me feeling happy and hopeful. I love that about this film. It took chances that so many movies wouldn't. I would say the weakest part of the story was the relationship of the siblings towards one another. It's not a big deal however, because we know how they felt about their father, which is ultimately the driving part of the story.Of course this isn't the first time in cinematic history that people have looked down their noses at a biblical film. Take for example King of Kings (1961). Critics initially joked when Jeffrey Hunter was cast in the role of Jesus. The film is a classic in my opinion and did the same thing Noah has set out to do. The story at it's root is a tragedy, but through love there is hope. In summary, give this film a chance and go see it on the big screen while you can. I am GLAD I defied the poor reviews and went to see this film. And I will go as far to say that this film will go on to be a classic. Though dark, it has heart and will be cherished for many years to come. I truly think this initial negative reaction by critics will be washed away...",Noah
1068,simongill460-432-906807,Noah is NOT the best Biblical adaptation,3,15 July 2014,"Just watched the movie last night on Blue Ray. As a Christian, I was expecting something that I can relate to with the Bible visuals. Just as the Passion of Christ was one of the best Biblical adaptation plus a very dramatic and well written movie. It was something for Christians to see in the last 12 hours of Christ which literally moved us. Keeping the urge, I was expecting to watch something extraordinary. However, after watching Noah I would say it lacks lot of Biblical parts. It's nothing but an improvision of the Original story. Director Darren Aronofsky tried to be very creative and added a story of his own into the Bible (which doesn't work at all). On the contrary, things that remained correct were Noah, his sons, an Ark (which was more of a box boat) and the flood. I've rated it 3 on the basis of the time-lapse scenes which were well executed in the film. The non-believers who do not know who Noah was, can find it interesting. But, for majority, it's just another Science Fiction film derived from the Bible and into the big screen with flaws in the script writing and story telling.",Noah
1069,agnijun,Visually stunning nature and bold acting from Russel Crowe overcome the controversial side of this take on the Biblical deluge,8,29 March 2014,"The story is, as you all know, based on the biblical deluge that is said to be brought upon the earth by GOD to cleanse His beautiful creation off sins. Darren Aronofsky handled a very tricky subject and as expected triggered ire in many people for re-imagining the events sacred to many religions, but to be honest the movie does not walk the path to do so but searches a harmony in between faith and logic through this chaotic representation. Russell Crowe as NOAH(son of LAMECH, descendant to SETH, the third son of ADAM and EVE and brother to CAIN and ABEL) donned several looks and nailed everyone of them as well as portraying various character traits of a loving father, an ardent believer, a fearless warrior and also a necessary evil. I won't divulge the plot in details. Crowe was all in all the movie with second in command being the visual spectacle followed by the plot. While Ray Winstone plays the role of antagonist TUBAL-CAIN(descendant of CAIN) convincingly by being the tyrant who boasts on making earth his own kingdom and again echoing the views of modernism as to why GOD will go as far as to wash away every trace of humanity from the face of the earth to punish MEN, the supporting cast in Jennifer Connelly, Douglas Booth, Watson and Logan Lerman delivers a performance that can best be described as average with the exception of very few scenes of Watson during a crucial moment in the story! Cinematography, special effects and background music is stunning while choreography in fight sequences is sloppy. Darren Aronofsky's take on the events might provoke people but its beauty can't be denied. Through this movie the motives behind creation is questioned with strong references to the First sin and the dominance of will, the greatest gift and burden to mankind, over right and wrong is established as we see the circle of life touch Noah in his state of dilemma and guides him throughout this movie.",Noah
1070,cbs-trav-465-615707,Lack of historical consistency,5,16 August 2014,"I thought this was a decent movie, however it takes way do many liberties with the story of Noah. In Genesis, Noah brought on board the Ark him and his wife along with his 3 sons and their wives, a total of 8 people. Hopefully with this amount of folks civilization could be born again. However, the only woman on the Ark is Noah's wife and Shem's wife Ila. I'm less concerned about the CGI which is necessary to illustrate this type of story, but taking to many liberties with the lack of principals makes the story less accurate. What I found interesting is the film and director brought forward the fact that heavily religious people misinterpret God's word and usually in many cases badly, and that continues today.The ""Watchers"" were an element of the film I wasn't really prepared for, as it took Noah 120 years to build the Ark and there have been mentioned he used workers. Also, the fact he was 600 yrs old when the Ark was completed and the flood occurred was never brought into the film's discussion.",Noah
1071,jonathan_white_1994,Irritated at the hate this movie is getting,8,17 April 2014,"First of all I want to state I was expecting to not enjoy this movie at the cinema. And while it was slow starting I exited the cinema being extremely happy and pleased with what I had just witnessed.The style of cinematography and colour is definitely reminiscent of Aronofsky and I found familiarity which reminded me a lot of 'The fountain' (My favourite Aronofsky movie). Specifically the first drop of rain falling onto Noah's head. But even more specifically the montage editing of Noah's story in the dark when they are aboard the ark. Now, I'm no biblical expert. But I know a lot of the things involved here are not involved in the original story of Noah. However, just because this is a biblical story why should that let a director limit his creative ideas? Aronofsky really made this story his own and I respect him for that. The acting from Jennifer Connelly was top notch. I mean really. Her emotional scene even made me fill up a little and was extremely powerful.The only thing that stops me from rating this movie any higher is that I knew where the plot was going. No matter how involved I got with the narrative, with the emotion of the characters, I knew how the story would end. As do we all. Sure this film isn't for everybody but I know that both me and my other half thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm sure there are many more people who will too. I'd recommend this movie to people who are fans of Aronofsky's auteur style which comes through in this film a heck of a lot more than I was expecting. Also, don't go into this movie expecting a word for word adaptation of the biblical story. Because it's not. The story has been changed and edited for the big screen and no, it was not made 'For Christians' as some other reviews have stated. Watch this with an open mind.",Noah
1072,ello_eiskind,"Impressive, terribly sad, beautifully told, some tolerance required",10,6 April 2014,"First, i want to mention i don't know the original Noah story in all its details, but i think i understand its meaning. Second i want to say, i do believe in god, but in my opinion i have a very open mind, and for this film you need to have this and also be tolerant. If you are none of this, you most probably don't like this film. Here is what i think of it:The film Noah doesn't tell the same content, as the bible-story does. There are new characters, new conflicts. Therefore its a different story, but for me it's not important that it's substantially correct told, cause the message of both, this film and the original story is the same, which is: Does mankind deserve living on this earth, cause they destroy more than they create? This is a very present topic today. In the case, the creators of this film just wanted to tell a story with this message, using a big flood, everyone would have said, ""Jesus, this is just Noah"", and now, as they called it ""Noah"", all of you say, ""No, not correctly equal to the bible- story-content. If you are a person, who says, the Noah story on its own is brilliant as it is, and you hate it, when people try to make perfect things better, which is mostly unnecessary, that's OK for me, BUThere are some points why retelling the story, and modifying it make a lot sense for me:-They changed the story, so that it's consistently logical/shows the dilemma. Sounds hard, but let me explain. The idea is: Humans are all sinners and don't deserve to live on, so all get drowned, to start all over. As Noah decides to kill all the sinners, by preventing them from entering the ark , and only rescuing the innocent animals, it is just more than consistent, that he and all of his family also deserve to die, because they are all humans. He thinks, even if his family might be innocent, cause they respect nature and just take what they need, his descendants may do the same mistakes again, because this is what humans are. This introduces the dilemma that his whole family has to commit suicide and gets worse as his adopted daughter is pregnant. The only way to stay consistent is to kill the new born babies. The solution for him is to finally grant mankind a second chance and letting his family survive. As he is a very disciplined man, this is very hard for him. All of these steps are so extremely logical and extremely sad, and make this topic so absolutely deep and philosophical and Don't appear in the original story, that i say: This is a great piece of applied religion and brought this topic/conflict so near to my mind, the original story never could.-the additional characters brought more depth to the story, new conflicts, and also made it very present today. This may sound strange, but an example might be Ham. He follows Noah, and bares all his instructions and the whole work, although he's so unhappy. He does all this, cause he believes in Noahs word, which are: Trust in the creator, cause he will look after you, and give you all you need. But this never happens during all the years he works on the ark. So he begins to doubt and struggle, although he still believes in Noah and the creator. But it is very hard for him. I know that feeling, to be patient although you never know, when or if your situation will ever improve. This, i guess was no part of the original story, but was so beautifully told, i don't wanna miss it, when i watch this movie again.-last, i want to mention the stone giants. There are more possibilities why they could have been added. First, how long do you guess a man, his wife and 4 children need to build an ark, which is more than 300m long. I can imagine this might take hundreds of years. They may need a little help. Next, i think they are a nice character representing an active, thinking and talking part of gods creation, which was scared away by the humans. Their past tells about all the cruelties peoples must have committed, cause originally the fallen angels where there to help the people. I can also imagine they represent a force which is not god's force itself, cause god rarely takes an active part in human's issues, but these giants somehow stand for a power, greater than single human, and still not divine. Noah needs this help also to defend himself against the rest of the world, cause he can't do it alone.All in all, i think it is not ""Noah"" actually anymore, cause it tells a modified story. I still think you may call it ""Noah"" cause the message is very similar. It's not film for kids, it needs a certain maturity to get it in all its details. Still i love the way it's told, its so beautifully sad, that i will never forget it :) EDIT: I read some of the 1-*-Reviews and want to add this:Still, if your belief doesn't allow to ""remix"" a bible story, if you will never be able to watch it without comparing it with its original all the time, this is probably the wrong film for you. This film is logical in itself, and has to be seen as a own opus, and from the point of view of story telling, i bought it.",Noah
1073,atulkl,The most disappointing movie in last 10 years for me,1,30 March 2014,"I have never been so, so... disappointed after watching a movie, the way I did tonight after I watched Noah Movie﻿! After watching its trailer, I thought this is one of ""those"" movies which come once in 10 yrs, but alas!The most shocking part was that this was no way close to the actual story of Noah in Bible! Some deviations and dramatizations are always welcome in movies, but here it was all just tooo much! Here's a quick list of major deviations from the Bible. * The ""Watchers"", the fallen stone angels, all made up. Where did they come from? * Noah's assumption of God's will till the end is that his own family is also expected to die? * Noah's younger son tries to take revenge on Noah, because Noah doesn't allow his 1 day old girl friend get on-board * When the great rain and flood starts only total four members of Noah's family get on-board (not 3 +3 = 6?) * One man, the head villain manages to get into Noah's Ark * This new villain manages to tie up with Noah's son to kill Noah * Noah tries to kill his twin newborn grand babies? * To top it all, Noah's daughter finally tells him that he doesn't have to kill her babies, and the God has given them a second chance.For all those who are planning to watch this to relate to the Bible version, it's a complete No No! For others, it's not even worth for just the special effects. Nothing spectacular!My Rating (Not that it may affect its sales): 0 out of 10",Noah

I expected something more biblical.... we're those shadow people who won 'Britain's got talent' last year in this film? i Chocked up a bit when a few animals trotted in, so to sum it up, the best thing about this utter nonsense for me was not nearly seeing Mr Crowe naked, or the other guy eating a lizardy thing but my cheese, ham and pickle sandwiches, washed down with a flask of tea!

1076,bill_hahn,Noah,1,30 March 2014,"OK, the director went on TV and said this movie was not an accurate biblical retelling of Noah's Ark but I feel that did not give him or the movie's backers the latitude to release advertisements that highlighted the Noah's Ark story to get patrons in and then add spoilers that insulted a major belief of several religions. The right-wing atheists that are now spreading garbage that religions are based on fairy tales now have a religious movie they can watch with enthusiasm that marries a great religious story with made up creatures out of a Lord of the Rings tale. Why weren't there advertisements depicting the ""stone creatures"" that appear in the movie? This movie is a major scam.",Noah
1077,jamesgorrie1,Blasphemous Biblical Pornography,1,29 March 2014,"I hated this film. Slow, clumsy, uninformed and jarringly offensive.Aronofsky defiled the Biblical account of God's punishment of Mankind for his ungodliness in the forms of debauchery, mockery of His laws and overall wickedness. This version eliminates the crucial element for judgment, that of Man's rebellion against God in his pursuit of ""strange flesh"" and substitutes environmental degradation as Man's greatest sin.Ironically, vegetarianism is held as a moral center of gravity, when the Bible clearly points out that just such a viewpoint is an indication of a wayward and godless society.The giant, rock-like Watcher creatures also helped eliminate any credibility to the story. They moved like very bad claymation characters and undermined Noah's struggle to build the ark. No big deal building a big boat when you've got giant rock dudes to do all the heavy lifting for you.Finally, The shed skin of the Serpent (Satan) in the Garden of Eden that Lamech and Noah use to bless the next generation with in Aronofsky's toxic tale is an evil poke at God. Blessing with the skin of Satan? Really? Just what went through Aronofsky's mind, or soul, in creating this strange rendition? One could imagine a deviant spirit doing no worse, for ""Noah"" certainly bears the mark of Cain.",Noah
1078,csrulz420,The first average movie I personally have watched made by Darren Aronofsky.,7,12 July 2014,"I had been waiting for this movie for months after its release. Noah was banned in my country and the only way for me to watch it was to download it. So i waited patiently till a 1080p print came out for download.The few months of waiting just bought me to one conclusion after watching it. The biggest budget used by Aronofsky delivers the biggest disappointment.I could not tell if its a lesson to humanity? Or just an average attempt to make an adventure movie while conveniently using a pre set plot. I have nothing against him using this plot, but my expectations of creativity by Aronofsky was not met.The movie does not keep you on the edge of the seat or guessing what is going to happen next like pervious Aronofsky movies. He is definitely one of my favorite directors but after watching this movie I am sincerely hoping his quality of movies does not go down to this.",Noah

I got to say that everything was exactly how i expected it to be , BORING .I almost fell asleep there on my seatBasically it's just a soap opera drama with sci-fi elements that really shouldn't be there in the 1st place. I mean really what were those stone man's doing there... I'm not a religious person , but is there any reference in the Bible of some sort of stone giant fallen angels helping Noah to build the damn Ark?The plot was sloppy and the characters didn't convinced me one bitIt was a waste of my time!",Noah
1080,TheophaniaTMR,Extremely bad movie & disgusting biblical adaption,1,9 August 2014,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***I will start off by saying I usually do not watch biblical movies or anything linked to biblical points of view because I am about critical about keep biblical aspects strictly linked to religious views and I just find it a bit conflicting to watch anything linked to biblical elements. With that said I gave this movie a chance it terms of I was talked into watching it. FIRST this movie even without biblical elements is a VERY bad movie the acting was not bad but not good enough to carry the horrendous elements in association with most of the environments in the movie such as walks in the dark such the scene were woken up for a dream/vision the main characters leave the tent is are outside...the environmental setting was awful they should have just put a green screen up because the ""visual effects"" and such were so child like and unrealistic is so many ways. Second okay in reference to the biblical elements I do not like debating biblical points of view but I do know the biblical story of Noah and knowing enough of it in comparing the movie it was so DISGUSTINGLY represented the only part of the movie that stays untainted in terms of my disgust is the actual ark itself. Simply the fact that there is a ""ARK"" holding animals, Noah with his family. EVERYTHING else is just left to whatever was I assume deemed as a entertaining movie. I KNOW/and for the most part respect the fact that any adaption of any type of film based on something else biblical, literature, points of view, etc are not put together strictly because especially in movie making there has to be some element which would entertain the audience. Although this movie was put together so badly and sickly that I do not anyone would really enjoy this movie at all. At the end of it I was so disgusted because basically you have a man that was chosen based on various attributes such as his faith and the strength of his faith. In addition he faces painful emotional, spiritual, physical challenges which I will respect in terms of I do not think it would a easy task for anything BUT once the door is closed on the ARK you are left with a individual who is almost a psychopath the WHOLE time so the whole faith and spiritual elements went out the door. The interactions in the Ark do not justify any faithful or spiritual elements at all it just is a sick revolving pattern of decisions, actions, fears, doubts, etc all resulted by again a man who is more of a psychopath rather than a man struggling with is humanity vs. faith.In the end, there was not justified closure for the end result of the whole experience because although he acted upon his humanity there is no clear indication he was right or wrong for it in connection with biblical outcomes, and his final actions, views, etc just left me feeling sick because it was such bad biblical/none biblical movie overall. I would not even recommend this movie for anyone that might come across it and decide to given it a chance out of boredom, or curiosity.",Noah
1081,press_ie,Disappointing Fabrication From Aronofsky,2,31 March 2014,"Although the movie has its moments, it ventures far away from the bible and dives deep into Aronofsky's self invented rabbit hole, sadly missing the quintessential truth of the Noah storyline by inventing the ridiculous notion (spoilers) that Noah believed that God's purposes were to end humanity with the death of his own family?? Aronofsky borrows from Lord Of The Rings in his depiction of fallen angels, which was so far fetched that no one could give serious thought afterward. The acting is not bad, but the movies is so dark that it leaves the audience with little to feel uplifted about. What could have been a classic biblical thriller, was turned into a dark fantasy fabricated solely from the nether regions of Aronofsky's mind.",Noah
1082,preona,An amazing film that deserves to be given a chance,9,8 April 2014,"Being a film junkie myself, I am confident when it comes to picking out what makes a movie bad and what makes an amazing movie that leaves you with an equally amazing feeling when walking out of the cinema. A bad movie can consist of predictable, boring, or annoying aspects- perhaps some scenes annoy you with the same old lines you've heard times before, or the entire movie could follow a boring story line with stupid or predictable bits such as a one-man battle against a million bad guys resulting in the good guy winning with hardly any bruises (we've all seen ones like those). ""Noah"" has been receiving some bad reviews, and after watching the movie myself, I really am confused. I understand that many people may disagree in the way the story advertises the original story in The Bible, but when it comes down to deciding whether this is a good movie or not- comparisons should really not be made. Let's just focus on the MOVIE shall we? If you are looking for a great cinematic experience with an open-mind, then try Noah! Please do not be put off by the negativity of some, for you will be missing out. Noah honestly ticks all the boxes for its continuous entertainment, hints of romance and also its tendency to wow 'real' audiences with the many visual wonders this movie has to offer.",Noah
1083,bagpiper-onnen,Noah has a lot on its mind.,7,8 September 2014,"As a Deist of sorts and a huge fan of Aronofsky's previous films, I had very mixed feelings coming into this movie, wondering how it could possibly work, but I tried not to let that cloud my judgment while I was watching. Fortunately, Darren Aronofsky succeeded marvelously in bringing the timeless tale of the death and rebirth of the world to life. Though the story is relatively simple, I could talk for hours about the themes that this film deals with and the questions it poses: Is mankind worth saving from destruction? Are we, burdened as we are with self-awareness and free will, doomed to make a mess of the world we have found ourselves in? Noah (the movie) did so many things right when they could just as easily have gone horribly wrong. It did not shy away from depicting the wretchedness of the descendants of Cain, nor did it gloss over their total demise in the Deluge. The screams that Noah's family heard, and the scene of the people desperately climbing up the crags of rock that had not yet been submerged are haunting. Surprisingly enough, the most engaging scene for me was Noah's narration of the Creation story, told over a cinematic depiction of the actual scientific understanding of the universe's origin... including evolution! Then it cuts to the legendary progenitors of humans as self-aware, cultural beings (Adam and Eve) who chose to defy God and separate themselves from the natural order of things, and to Cain, the symbolic progenitor of murder. The juxtaposition of Cain murdering Abel with the silhouettes of dozens of war-fighters throughout history was utterly chilling. Aronofsky has a way of bringing out the best possible performances from his actors, and this is the first time I've seen such high- caliber acting on Russel Crowe's part in years. Crowe's Noah is both sympathetic and frightening, and Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson also give emotionally charged performances as his wife Naameh and adopted daughter Ila respectively, though they have comparatively fewer opportunities to demonstrate their talent.This is a monumental, moving film that should be seen by believers and non-believers alike. It saddens me that Noah has had so much hate directed towards it for what seem (to me, at least) to be illogical and trivial reasons, or that are critical of the movie's theology rather than its own merits.",Noah
1084,shopkins-598-996951,I guess this is a spoiler alert - or just warning to not see,1,29 March 2014,"I would give this movie a -10 if I could. So listen up Believers and intelligent movie goers. If you're planning to take your kids to see the story of Noah - bad idea! I mean, it would be a good idea if it actually were the story of Noah. I mean, there's an arc, animals (who are anesthetized) and a flood. But that's about where the similarities with the Biblical version end. Missing are the wives of Ham and Japheth (which are portrayed as adolescent youth) Also missing from your Sunday School story are the rainbow and God's promise and covenant to his people. However, you do get to explain to your kids about the crazy rock-monsters guarding the arc, about the lunatic stowaway trying to kill Noah, and why Noah is trying to kill his granddaughters born on the arc. I'm not making this up. But obviously someone did. It's just plain bad. take my advice and don't waste your money on this crap.

The graphics, I would say are passable, the acting way too slow, the story line, so weird and incomprehensible that you can't follow it and the ending flat.But this is not a story about a suicidal maniac who spends half the movie trying to murder his own grandchildren... It is a story about a Biblical character, that everyone knows from childhood, who (in the eyes of the movie makers) is a suicidal maniac who spends half the movie trying to murder his own grandchildren... and is slow, and incomprehensible and has a flat ending.The stuff incorporated from the Book of Enoch could have been totally awesome, but instead of making these ""fallen angels"" into awesome bad guy characters with Noah being the good guy hero, they made the demons out to be the good guys (at the same time as acknowledging that they were fallen angels), and left Noah to be some confused guy who never really heard God's voice or knew what he was doing.So much potential for a good story... so totally wasted.Too bad, eh?",Noah

This movie deals with existence, religion, epistemology, violence, corruption, greed and balance of nature. This movie is filmed in a way I've never seen before, and it contains at least two of the greatest sequences I've ever seen in film. Like my father said after watching the movie, the movie is like a dream. It leaves you feeling different at a subconscious level, and at numerous times you have to really work your mind to bring you back to reality -- what you call reality really lets you think about who you are in this world.",Noah
1089,wardswift,Unconventional,10,7 July 2014,"In today's world there are few adaptations to stories told. NOAH is an exquisite example of what can be done to unearth the graciousness of sacred ideas. It exemplifies the courageous heart of film-makers that seek to define where we are now as human beings and allows us to dismiss the speculative, retrograde, emotive influence of religion and/or its common ancestor, imagination. The innovative context of NOAH suggests often criticized evolutionary concepts are real and the bewildering adherence to aging beliefs that are quaint, forgotten, or miraculously transformed into vast never lands of staged innocence, have been misleading. Dualist religious fugitives will run from this film but the chaos represented in the character of Noah will cement those who long for a reality based tradition.",Noah

I don't remember hearing anything about then when my mom took me to church. I also was very confused the entire time. Now on to the visual effects. I felt like I was watching a Tim Burton film (which I love Tim Burton Films but this type of visual effect choice isn't exactly great for a biblical title. And the background and scenes were just too much. If you want me to sit down and watch a movie, the visuals have to be appealing. Then there's the cast. I always loved Russell Crowd and his works.

1091,dismas-33,Comedy or science fiction?,1,3 August 2014,"I really wanted to decide on my own as to the merits of this film. But my first struggle was trying to figure out what genre this movie fell in to. At first I couldn't figure out if it was a comedy or science fiction. This was especially true during the Yoda scenes with Anthony Hopkins. At one point, I even thought it might be a horror flick, as Noah pulls a ""heere's Johnny"" moment, reminiscent of The Shining, as he hunts down his newborn grand- daughters on the roof of the ship. And yes, there was action too, as scissors (spears) were somehow able to beat rock (giant stone monsters). These giant stone monsters did remind me of the beloved Ents in the Lord of the Rings, which is probably why I was able to put up with this non-sensical aspect of the movie. There was even a 'coming of age' sub-plot going on, where it finally dawns on Ham (Noah's middle child) that this cruise he is about to take may land him into celibacy. But it quickly turned into a thriller, as Ham's revenge on his father (for not freeing his new found girl-friend from the bear trap which causes her to get trampled by a charging army) dominates the rest of the film. But the drama wasn't lost on me either, especially when Noah realizes that he lets God down for not fulfilling God's will to kill off the human race (I must have missed that day of religious education). But like all failures, Noah no sooner lands the ark, finds some grapes, learns how to make wine, and becomes the first man who could have used the 12 steps. But in retrospect, the director missed out on a great opportunity to bring in both a Friday the 13th and Titanic theme. Shem and Lia could have raced to the top of a sinking ark, with a deranged Noah in pursuit with his knife, only to have the stowaway (I missed this in Sunday school too) trip him up. And then one of the elephants falling the length of the ark could have body slammed both the protagonist and antagonist into the Persian Gulf. But as I struggle to identify the genre, I realize that I left out 'mystery'. But the real mystery is – why the hell did I spend $1.20 and waste 2 hours of my life?",Noah

It was like reading the book to a movie before hand and then once you see the movie you wander if you bought the right tickets!

An entertaining, contemporary interpretation with some artistic freedom that only served to support positive and/or thought provoking psychological themes such as human nature, environmentalism, survivor's guilt and love - the movie never referring to God but always to ""the Creator"" which reaches a more relevant, modern religious crowd and to non-believers as well. Whatever complaints that literalists have are silly. It's a made up story of a made up story ripped off from the Epic of Gilgamesh. No one should be complaining unless it's genuinely about the acting or cinematography or even the ""rocky angel transformers"" (though I found the acting/cinematography to be quite excellent and maybe the angels a little strange), but the story itself, despite its scriptural liberties, is solid and entertaining.

I'm not a Christian, I'm a Deist, my boyfriend is an Atheist (both of us grew up in a Muslim family) and we both know the most versions of flood. In Quran, Bible or Torah... who decides it is the TRUE story of the Noah? Who saw what really happened? Who can dare to say ""This is what happened."" Do not start with ""But in Bible...""

I mean it is also a fantastic story about Noah, you know and it is not very consistent with holy books.Secondly; who said that this film SUPPOSED TO BE BIBLICAL? I mean even the versions in the holy books sounds fantastic. You believe that fantastic scripts and you don't like a fantastic story/film version of it? You must be joking. It is creative story-telling.I loved the acting. I loved how they showed a prophet so humanly. We can see how the humans flawed and needs to be purged from the earth by watching Cain's descendants. And also they reflected the human nature's flaws by showing even Noah and his family has flaws and it is very successful.I must admit that the Watchers are a little bit over fantastic. But when we evaluate it according to the plot it makes sense. I mean, they created a story for the Watchers and it is consistent within.Please, stop watching and evaluating this film as a Biblical story and enjoy it as a fantastic movie.

It had giant walking rocks called watchers, which were the fallen angels that had been thrown down to the earth for disobeying ""the creator"", and they helped Noah build the ark. Noah comes off as an environmentalist gone mad-he thinks the ""creator"" wants him to kill his soon to be born granddaughters to permanently end the human race so that nature can once again flourish and be beautiful again. There was nothing Biblical about this movie. 99% anti Biblical account. The only Biblical truths - there was a flood and Noah had 3 sons and a wife.

I went in expecting to see this, only to find that this is not the case. The story is very well written, surprisingly so considering how vague, and simplistic the source material is in Genesis. The director did a good job of adding to the story and elaborating on details not to be found in the Bible. This is probably the best I could ever imagine a full length film about Noah ever being, seeing how little there was to work with. It was strange to see this film, which was thoroughly entertaining, being attacked so virulently online though. It seems so many of the films detractors often haven't even seen the film. Perhaps this isn't the case, but it seems like the reviews that made me expect this movie to be stupid were by people with some ideological opposition to this film, I suspect either creationists, or (less likely) atheists. That aside, this was a good movie. Perhaps I only rate this so high in defiance of its critics, but it is up there. The visuals are good, though a bit unusual. The story is well crafted, and I even had emotional reactions to parts. However, if for whatever reason you would be annoyed that things have been added or changed, you would be better off not seeing it, but you will be missing out on a lot. The same goes if a depiction of religious imagery in a film would be blasphemous to you, but of course in that case its just an example of this movie not being made for you.",Noah

1099,adam-712-267704,Noah - An Atheist Review,3,29 March 2014,"***** Warning - This review contains spoilers, but then again, so does the bible right? *****OK, so I just got back from seeing Noah with my son. As expected, there was a significant amount of religion involved, especially at the beginning of the movie. The first 5 minutes were rather humorous, albeit unintentionally. Once you are able to suspend your belief, the movie becomes enjoyable, for a while. It is, mostly, your typical good guy underdog vs evil mastermind with large army, and they go out of their way to make sure you see those evil people as truly evil. I mean, they actually EAT MEAT! How much more evil can you get!Anyway, so the Ark is built with the help of angels that were cast out of heaven for going against gods will. Think tree ents, from LotR, but made from rocks instead of trees. As the flood approaches, they form the last line of defense as the evil meat eating hoard tries to board the ark. Flood hits, everyone makes it, Noah is a giant jerk, etc.Once underway, Noah tells the story of Genesis 1, but with a twist. You see, according to this, the big bang is real, and god caused it. The Earth really did form from gravity pulling things together, but it was god who caused that too. Oh, also, god caused the moon to break off from the Earth. Next, and I was amazed by this part, Noah tells the story of creation, in the form of evolution. Yes, we actually watch as fish come onto the land. We watch as this CGI fish slowly transforms and evolves to numerous other creatures, until we get to monkeys. But that is where evolution stops.At this point, apparently god decides that he needs to interfere, and ABRACADABRA! Man is born. Man eats forbidden fruit. Man sucks. Cain kills Abel. This causes world war 1 and 2. Etc etc etc, you get the point.Now, we settle in for 30 minutes of sleep inducing, internal conflict and fighting as Noah decides to slaughter the child carried by his sons wife (Emma Watson). Because, according to Noah, god wanted all of mankind destroyed. Loving god, right?Anyway, Noah decides not to in the end. They all make up, and live happily ever after, with a closing sequence that includes a giant rainbow, because you know, god promises never to mass murder mankind ever again.In the end, movie was 30-45 minutes too long. It attempted to claim the big bang and evolution as biblical principles. It was pathetic, and its going to make a load of money.",Noah

1102,munteanurobertflorin,Great as always from Aronofsky,8,8 April 2014,"I've been waiting for this movie since it was announced. This collaboration between one of my favorite actors, Russell Crowe, and one of my favorite directors, Darren Aronofsky, made me save money for three weeks and buy myself a ticket to watch this. All ""leii"" (Romanian leu) were worth it. An amazing blend of visual effects and psychological decisions, the latter being a trademark of Darren - somehow similar to ""The Fountain"".It was an interesting step taken by the director to do an epic drama instead of a drama that features few characters and simple sets (Black Swan). I must say that I was a little skeptical about the visual effects that will oust the masterliness of Aronofsky's directing. No, the effects were well used (I'm not saying the best because they cannot compete with other sci-fi or fantasy movies).I've even seen some elements used by Aronofsky in his directed movies (tracking shots, and even the scene when Noah sees himself as a cannibal savage - the Doppelgänger concept used in ""Black Swan""). Aronofsky know how to direct movies that are similar one way or another but still make you watch them - having an 'original' tinge. And ""Noah"" doesn't make an exception.I rated it 9 because it is a little bit too long, a montage of images when Noah tells us about the Genesis which it should have been used at the beginning of the movie and not in the middle, and also because Clint Mansell - the score composer - disappointed me in some moments.As for acting, Russell Crowe was once again phenomenal, Jennifer Connely amazed me again and Emma Watson really got rid of typecasting (It is not known only as Hermione anymore). I will not get surprised if she will receive a Golden Globe or SAG nomination. Not even the movie itself will get.",Noah
1103,Richdybowski,Nasty Noah. Dreadful Dreary Film,1,31 August 2014,"I was looking forward to an Epic movie about the well known Noah and the Ark story. I am an atheist so I don't care too much about how accurate it was to the Bible. But where to start with this awful, slow, bad CGI, dark film in which Noah is a nasty man.Firstly it is just so slow and dreary - 95% of the film is with such low light I was asleep in half an hour. I drifted in and out of consciousness throughout the entire film, only waking when Emma Watson came on the screen, I had to then watch the whole film again. Double trouble - that's 5 hours I lost today.Secondly - Noah is a nasty man in this film. It starts off all ""meat eaters are bad"" to then ""you will not get on my boat"" and then loads of killing. He becomes psychotic and angry, he has a choice to save a girl but says no and lets her get trampled to death. Then Emma decides to have twins and Noah was going to murder them.Thirdly - I just don't understand what message the film is trying to put across. First it is ""meat eaters are bad"" then there is a clip of evolution, followed by Adam eve and the original sin. Then there's the Baby killing Fourthly - ROCK MONSTERS? Or Angels - this reminded me of Jason and the Argonauts. The CGI here was terrible for a 125m budget Fifthly - this is a film about saving animals and a flood. The animal scene is about 2 minutes and they are all sedated, and the flood is 2 mins. The rest of the film is just drivel.So to sum up - this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. They have used the name of Noah simply to make ticket sales. Don't watch it.",Noah
1104,Bryanaustin130,I enjoyed!,7,31 March 2014,"If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings and don't mind a loose mythical take on the story of Noah, you may enjoy this film. If not, you may hate this film.I watched every Darren Aronofsky film in preparation for this movie which only made me more excited for the potential of it. He is a quality director who researchers his material thoroughly. This is a delight to see. This was also Darren Aronofsky's first massive blockbuster and after seeing it, I think he will have many more opportunities. Where the reaction will divideLiteral - Aronofsky does not give a literal account of the biblical, Genesis account of the story. As Emma Watson explained in her interview, to be word for word would result in a silent film seeing that Noah doesn't speak until off the boat. Aronofsky goes further though, much further. He takes a visually mythical approach to the snippet written in Genesis 6:4 (ever heard of rock people?) with signs of influence from the apocryphal Book of Enoch. He also later adds to the story an intense dilemma that Noah will face while in the boat.""Artistic License"" - I use this word only because it is what was being used in the media. This is where I found myself in preparation to Noah. I knew Aronosfky would not make a literal movie and knew not to expect it. I thought his mythical adaptations were wonderful. At first sight of these ""rock people"" I began to wonder whether I may not enjoy his take which I hoped to God would not show similarities to The Fountain. It didn't, at least not in the horrific way displayed in The Fountain. The one ""Artistic License"" complaint I had was explained well to me by my brother. When watched you will see that Aronofsky carries, in yes a non literal way, the whole story of Noah somewhat beautifully synonymous of the text. Then he takes a hard left turn onto an entirely different road not described in the story of Noah to add one more dilemma of extreme intensity. Although it was a dilemma that I believed was a good story piece, it may have been too much to add on top of all the rest. And while I completely gave him his ""artistic license"", he had me believing for a second he may actually create a story that really could have achieved a fascinating mix of both literal and artistic license. My Verdict7.7/10I really enjoyed this film, but I believe it all depends on how one goes into the movie and what you are expecting out of the movie which will determine much of your like or dislike.www.FilmSnobBlog.tumblr.com",Noah
1105,mmahb,disaster,1,19 April 2014,"This is the worst depiction of a prophet's life i have ever seen. It shows a big amount of disrespect for a prophet who lived around 1000 yrs trying to get his people to believe and stop all the bad they are doing. He spent his life teaching them God's teachings , yet the movie does not even show ONE scene where he is teaching anyone. On the contrary, it shows him living with his family in an abandoned place hiding away from people. Instead of getting help from the believers to build the arc, the director/writer ""invented"" creatures he called ""watchers"" that don't exist in none of the three religions and made them Noah's sole supporters. The visions he sees which are supposed to be messages from God are so misguiding that you feel confusion fills his mind. His personality does not come close to a prophet's personality. He looks so week while his wife is so wise. He seems hesitated and always thinking if he is doing the right thing when he-as a prophet- should be so full of confidence and so sure that what he is doing is the most righteous thing because it comes from God. The story of his wife is totally different than we know it. His sons are only 3 in the movie, but the truth is that he has more sons, Kenaan for example ( the kid who stood above a high hill thinking he could survive the flood). He also has a daughter in law in the movie of which no one has heard of. It is also an ""invention"" of the director, and her story- untrue as it- consumes a lot of the film's time. Portraying a prophet of God is not a joke. It is not just a story you can modify as you like. These holy stories should be treated with respect . The movie is a total disaster. If you know Noah's story, you will know that the movie is full of lies. I don't recommend this movie for children for it will leave a very distorted image of a respectful prophet.",Noah

And then surprising to see them playing roles with no story-line, character, charm or intrigue.Other biblical films use novel ways of portraying the narrative. This film, however, does not use novel concepts to portray the narrative. It uses novel concepts and wild imagination to derive a new narrative that lacks a sense of completion, and in places lacks coherence. There is also an inconsistency between working traditional views and modern views into the storyline making it a confusing and odd film. For this reason, whether you have traditional or liberal Christian leanings or are atheist or anything in between, it cannot be recommended to view this film - it will be of no satisfaction in terms of your world-view.Besides the poor plot line and poor backdrop, there is good acting and in places the characters are convincing. This one success of the film raises the rating to 1/10.",Noah
1107,rogerblake223,Good but not great,7,13 July 2014,"I have had to LOL at many of the critics on this one. This is not the fluffy two by two animal story you read as a kid however I think the movie does hit a lot of key points from the Noah/bible story and brings them into the movie well. I had a much better time watching this movie after putting all thoughts of the 'original' story out of my head.I thought this movie was actually pretty good. It had faults with the CGI in places which definitely weren't quite up to par but didn't detract from the movie and it did deliver quality moments both in picture and film quality. I personally thought it fell a little flat in character development and scripting as I never really felt invested in any of the characters except maybe Ray Winstones character. Russell Crowe also did a good job of playing Noah and pulling off a character that shows him to be both struggling between his basic human morality, own will, and being someone who follows 'the creators' will to the utmost point, almost mindlessly and without question.On the actual story aspect, this is an adaption of a religious text so you're never going to please everyone. I think the writers did a great job on getting the most important points from the story through in the movie i.e. follow your own will (will of man) and you will die, following the creators will (or being born under Seth and therefore not marked) and live through the cleansing. God only has mercy for the chosen few and those that follow his will. The Creator is a vengeful and 'just' God who will annihilate you if you don't follow him etc. Noah showed this by killing someone who had killed an animal at the beginning. I thought it was a good way of portraying this aspect of the bible and Noah story and set the tone well. I found it odd that they added the big bang theory in there, was this a dig or did they simply want to make it more palatable to a wider audience? Either way, I liked it. 'The watchers' are from the bible although I have a feeling that some Christians are unaware that there are a)more books in the bible then are printed in your standard King James version and b)there is more than one translation and version of the bible dependent on your denomination. The writers took literary license when they turned the watchers into stone giants and from there on really however I didn't see anything wrong with this, it is after all a movie adaption from a story not a documentary.Overall I thought it was a great adaption and a reasonable movie. Definitely worth a watch but overall its not one that will stay in my mind for too long.",Noah

Using Crowe, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Ray Winstone was an awesome choice, but adding badly damaged rock-like-Transformers to this already fictional story could have been left out, but then of course, who would build the ark!???? So their's your WTF moment, oh and if you used sleeping gas to puts every animal to sleep, you best believe everyone on the ark would have also been, as Chris Tucker stated in the movie Friday, Knocked the Fuzz Out...

I believe Noah was perhaps the greatest prophet, and yes I believe that God spoke to him. He preached repentance to the sinful people, and yes they tried to destroy him. The earth was not cleansed because of the some industrial pollution (green agenda), it was because of the wickedness of the people.... Calling out that fact is impossible for Hollywood, so instead they portray Noah as a drunkard, a vegan, someone who believes only the animals are worthy to remain on the earth, not any humans. The trailer for this movie is awesome, the actual movie disappoints on every level. Trust me, it is not worth seeing, especially if you are a God-fearing person. This will not increase your faith in holy things. Fact, there were eight people on the Ark. Ham and Shem and Japheth would have all taken a wife with them. See 1 Peter 3:20",Noah

No hint of a band of hippies living on moss confronting an Industrialized bunch of 'bad guys' with magic crystals and Iron Age weaponsthat would be in Anatolia (making weapons), I believe about 3,000 years ago. It's a thinly veiled plea to stop Industrialization by the pseudo-hippies in L.A. who think we should all be vegetarians and give up our cars, jets, air conditioning, etc..

1111,gerald-britton,Biblical account lost in flood,1,4 August 2020,I watched in shocked disbelief the scenes of Noah and the fanciful extra-biblical characters. The story is so well known from the judeo-christian tradition that messing with it is immediately recognizable.Where do I start? How about those Rock ents? Voices and characters stolen from The Lord of the Rings. How about the children and their wives? the Bible is absolutely clear that all the boys had wives when they entered the ark and when they left it. What about the stowaway? There was no stowaway on the ark that's recorded in the story.The thing is all of these items are well known. Nobody's fooled here into thinking that that's the way it might have gone down.

However, seeing a cast that includes Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins, I thought ""how bad can it be?"". You don't have to be a Christian to hate this movie. I have to agree with other reviewers -- terrible script -- bad acting -- and ridiculous to call this movie ""Noah"". I don't think it could even be a cult film. I, too, was looking forward to a biblical epic using wonderful CG effects, but the special effects looked incredibly fake -- something from the 80's -- rock monsters were a bad Transformers rip-off. I honestly can't think of any positive element in this movie. Even the costumes are a joke -- short dress with leggings for Noah's wife? -- really? Noah wore Mad Max/Waterworld clothes. Even one of the children wore a trendy scarf around the neck that can be seen in every JC Penneys in the country.

They should have called it by another name and not the one that is so closely tied to the Judeo Christian God. Maybe they went wrong when they got a director that thinks this is just a Myth. This movie could have been such a major success. Liberals of this magnitude do not understand us. One, if Goliath was a descendant of giants, what was that I saw in the film? I could have dealt with the antagonist, but the baby issue, WHAT? I just do not know where to start there. Noah was also hundreds of years old, with much wisdom. I ship like this had never been seen because one like this was never needed. Most, if not all the animals would have been babies, and it would have been animals after their kind. Nothing about dinosaurs were addressed (remember, dinosaur is a fairly new word), and yet our great ancestors all around the word speak of dragons, and so does the bible. T Rex soft tissue was recently found, figure that one out? Where did these stories of dragons come from if they were not among those to be on the ark from a Christian perspective. One from each kind right, even dragons. Makes for a cooler story than Harry Potter dragons, if one of Noah's sons missions were to get eggs of a certain kind of dragon. The story could have been elaborated, but they did it very wrong without any Christian input. If the creators of this movie thought it was mythical, they should have just kept it the way Christians like it. It would have been a win win. Christians believe this happen, unbelievers believe it makes for a nice mythological movie. So, why so many big changes?",Noah

The flow of the images with the narration and music has a perfect harmony. I loved the art direction of the movie. For instance, the graphical design of the Watchers (Nephilims) was extraordinarily brilliant. With almost no facial expression and even almost no face, you can identify with the Nephilims and feel their sorrow. Performing Noah is a very hard work but Russell Crowe did an amazing job, his performance almost close to perfect. The story of Noah is world wide known and it is also in the three monotheistic religions.

Terrible script, it's not as though they had to come up with an idea for a story line - it was drafted many years ago. In spite of this the script gives the impression of being written on the hoof with no one centrally driven idea or narrative, but a jumble.2.

Showing Noah naked was absolutely unnecessary 4. I prefer in the movies of prophets to avoid sexual contents. 5. the final part of the movie was very pessimist, on the contrary, God gave Noah a new start and to build decent generation.anyway, I would like to highlight some of the differences in the story from Islamic point view: 1. Noah's wife didn't get into the ark, she died with the bad people - just like the wife of prophet Lot 2. there was 2 sons of Noah died also, one died before the time of the flood, the other was nonbeliever 3. non of the bad people managed to get into the ark - not like Tubal who climbed the ark and hid inside!",Noah

It fails as an action movie, it fails as a fantasy movie and it fails as a biblical movie. I understand the decision to make a less faith based version of this story, but if they had at least followed the biblical chain of events it would have been pleasing to it's built in audience, which are those of faith. Instead it has CGI creatures called ""Watchers"" who help Noah build the ark. Noah just seems to be an action hero instead of someone who follows a different path from the rest of the world. He keeps having flashbacks and dreams, and it almost seems like he's dropping acid or something. I would have rather seen a man who just wakes up one day and starts building an ark, not knowing if it's going to pay off. Instead it seems all the hard work is done by his rock friends, there is very little questioning of if he is doing the right thing. Instead it seems Noah is having some family issues with his sons and wife. Russell Crowe as Noah always speaks in calm low bass tones. It also seems that Noah's sons are having girlfriend issues as well. There are so many issues with this movie that it's almost not worth it to go on.

In fact it does a good job exposing how psychotic this particular myth really is and what a down right SOB the Old Testament God is. The story gets silly at times with its eco-message and Hobbit like CG but there is a humanistic moral center to the high intensity drama that's not what the biblical literalists want to hear. I like to think of this as the functional equivalent of a old master painting that brings a new perspective to a traditional religious theme. This is what artists do and Darren Aronofsky is definitely an artist.

My wife Kim got up and walked out about 20 minutes into it and told me to text her when it was over. I sat there and shook my head for another 2 hrs. If you think it's going to be anything like the Bible's Noah, save your money and stay home, or go watch Son of God or God's not Dead instead. It's more like a depressing sci-fi fantasy movie that has no relation to the Bible, but what do you expect from a director who is a self-avowed atheist. What a farce!Noah was befriended by fallen angels (i.e. demons) portrayed by rock monsters with glowing eyes and computer voices who helped him build the ark and protect him from the evil king who wanted to take over the ark (Yeah right!). And Noah was instructed by ""The Creator"" (the word God is never mentioned in the movie) to kill his granddaughters born on the ark because they were capable of continuing mankind and The Creator wanted all of mankind to be destroyed including Noah's family! DUH, what would be the point of building the ark then? Just a cruel joke? The atheist movie director doesn't have a clue! It's a stupid B sci-fi fantasy movie. I'm waiting for Heaven Is For Real and Left Behind.",Noah
1130,res41,"Review of ""World Noah"" vs. ""Actual Biblical Noah""",1,27 March 2014,"So many things went wrong with this film. The fact that the director also directed ""Requiem for a Dream"", a movie about sex and drugs, is enough reasoning for believers not to expect a Biblical based movie. And, that expectation held true. From the movie portraying Noah as being an ungodly man, to the flood being cause by global warming; this film made some MAJOR mistakes. It's extremely dangerous to take something out of God's Word, the Bible, and twist into how you want it to sound for cinematic purposes. That's exactly what was done with this movie. This world is growing darker and darker as it was during the TRUE Noah event in the Bible. God used a flood in Noah's time to judge mankind. The Bible says that the next time God is going to judge the earth, He's coming by fire. In the Bible, Noah was a godly man who begged other humans to heed to the message from God, but as is so common today, they were content in their own sin. That same call is offered to every human today, through Jesus Christ; the perfect sacrifice for our sins. Just like their sins needed judged in Noah's time, the sins of the world today will too be judged, unless you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to save you. Where will you spend eternity!? THAT is the message that needed to be in this movie! All of these statements and facts come directly from the BIBLE, as this movie should have been done.",Noah
1131,rmncrdns,Disappointing to say the least,1,24 March 2014,"I can't remember every waiting for a movie to hit the big screen with as much anticipation as I did with this one. I even went to another country to watch the film with my family as they were not yet showing in my local theater. Expecting to show my 6 year old son a visual representation of one of the most important stories of the Bible. As i said very disappointing not only did they get it all wrong, but I am extremely offended as a Christian to see what they have done with this film. The mistakes although I am not a biblical scholar were very easy to identify that even my son caught them. For example the fallen angels no where in the bible does it say that they were somehow turned into stone remember they were supposed to have mated with the daughters of men and given birth to giants. Also Noah was to have taken over a hundred years to build the ark with the help of his family Not the help of some giant rock monsters. A mistake ? I think not I am sure that who ever made the decision to roll out this film new exactly what they were doing. God forbid if someone tried to make a movie about some other faith and get it wrong they might even be put in jail. So why the double standard hear or am I just imagining things?",Noah

1133,info-957-345229,How Neolithic man caused terrible climate change,1,25 March 2014,"Noach paints a picture of the world of 10.000 years ago where the 50.000 odd people that roamed the world in those days have caused dramatic and catastrophic climate change. This is no mean feat and it is not explained in this horrible movie how the handful of people have managed to do this. The people are portrayed as evil villains who have no love for animal and nature and who like to kill animals just for fun. Noach is portrayed in this movie as some kind of crazy hippie vegetable and fruit gatherer who maintains an animal hospital to take care of wounded animals that have escaped the evil claws of the poachers.This movie is nothing else then another sermon about man causing climate change and the goodness of the elite and the badness of mankind. It actually makes a point that it is best that mankind should be culled because they do nothing else then destroying the planet, and that just a small elite of people has the right to survive because they are good.That is why God brings a big flood to cleanse the world of those horrible people and Noah and his family and the animals they bring into the Ark are the only ones that are saved.It is incredible that this movie receives such high rates it is likely one of the worst propaganda movies ever made by Horriblywood but who knows, maybe that high rating is also part of the plan.",Noah
1134,shirleydaughteroftheking,Hitler Behind the Camera,1,26 March 2014,"Russell Crowe (ET online.com) said; ""The funny thing with people, ya  know, they consider Noah to be a benevolent figure-you know-because he  looked after the Animals. ""Awe, Noah, Noah and the animals."" I'm like,  ""Are you kidding me! This is the dude that stood by and watched the  entire population of the planet...perish. He's not benevolent, he's not  even nice."" At one point in the story, his son says ""I thought you were  chosen because you were good?"" and he goes ""I was chosen because I can  get the job done"". So I think people are going to-...judging where  peoples questions come from-... I think their gonna be quite surprised  what Noah actually really means - What it means to really be in that  position.""   Would you let someone make a movie portraying your mother as a drunk  and a harlot? A then on top of that, pay to go and see it? In the movie  1.Methuselah is portrayed as a witch doctor. 2.Noah is like a crazy  man, more like worshiping the animals, saying the animals are innocent  and only they may reproduce after to flood. 3.Only one of Noah's son's  wives get on the Ark.(which suggest that only one man and woman  repopulated the earth after the flood.) 4.Tubalcain hides on the Ark.  5.Noah desires to kill all females who may repopulate the earth.   I mean if their going to make a movie about the Bible, they could at  least get it right. I say we send a message and give our money to the  movie makers who care about truth. (Like the makers of Courageous) and  say NO to these film makers who haven't the slightest idea of what  righteousness and integrity is.  I've been reading reviews and I came across this review on IMDb.com and  this is their goal;  ""I ... found very difficult to sympathize with Russell Crowe's  character. Especially when my 7 year old daughter whispered ""Noah is a  very mean man! Why does he want to kill the baby girls? Is he crazy  dad?""   The Bible tells us that Noah was a preacher of righteousness for 120  years before the flood, warning people of the impending danger to come.  They did not have to miss the boat, yet like toady, people choose to  reject God and the wonderful Salvation He freely offers. Isaiah  55:6-13.   This movie was filmed by professing atheist who hate God. In this movie  they want people to think that Noah was a ""mean man"". This is called  pure propaganda.   It's like Hitler behind the camera, wrecking truth and pouring out  lies.",Noah

1136,anumber1,What a missed opportunity,2,11 July 2014,"I had heard the contention around this movie mainly from a Christian evangelical point of view, but held no opinion till I watched it for myself.Please see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7bPCYizcFM for this evangelical perspective.The film was given a pretty poor score by me as I feel it was a great opportunity missed.The biblical account is a fantastic story, men with dinosaurs men who were giants, great fountains of the deep exploding, tectonic plate movement the formation of the grand canyon in a few hours. As well as the SONS of GOD being angels and possibly creating human animal hybrids, corruption the genetic make-up of humans and animals.True evil of mankind, child sacrifice, bestiality, murder rape all required subject matter, bu not in this film.This could have been done if it was needed by adding some extra biblical plot drivers and settings technological environment, pyramid building, maned flight, atomic bombs. Some believe these were present pre flood technologies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sR1u1Mm_sY Any how I am sounding like some one who read famous novel which he came to love, then it was turned into a film and was very disappointed, cliché. No surprise there. But with Christians, Muslims and Jews all holding to the Flood account of history, that's at least 3 billion people who would have been highly interested in a actual biblical account.That's enough of my rant what of the actual film.Well this film obviously seeks to make GOD out to be a real tyrant, showing the pre flood environment being unable to support the human population, this is not biblical as mankind was flourishing before the flood but being continuously evil, in their thoughts and deeds, yes the earth was cursed but so it is today. The fossil record records better air with a higher oxygen content, bigger animals more bio diversity and bio mass, more types or kinds of animals and more of them as well as increased size.Also the voice of GOD is never heard, allowing it to appear as if , GODS commandment to build an ark is only in the mind of Noah, who has dreams and visions on one occasion appearing to be induced by a hallucinogenic dink, given to Noah by his Uncle Methuselah.This then leds to Noah believing that GOD wants to destroy the whole of humanity including Noah and his family, this clearly was not the point of the Ark, to save animals only. There is a part in the film where Noah goes to look for wives for two of his sons, but returns after seeing the evil bickering starving humanity who have massed near to where he is building the Ark, and concludes that it is GODs will that his two sons with out a wife must stay single to allow the extinction of humanity. This later leaves the viewer uncertain if the GOD portrayed in this film want to preserve Noah and his family as the bible teaches or if the preservation only occurs due to Noah refusing to commit infanticide by killing his two female twin grand children offspring born to an adopted daughter, who was barren until Methuselah heals her allowing her to conceive.I could go on haw Noah only builds the Ark with the help of fallen angels who are encrusted in rock, what a silly idea.This film will fail as it has a silly plot, and because it is not biblical will alienate the the 3 billion potential viewers and as it is a set in a very loose biblical context will also alienate or not interest the rest of humanity.Truly Great films based on biblical accounts such as The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur even possibly Spartacus have always chosen to reflect the biblical account as a result they have been watch and loved by billions of believers. When you make a film based on the bible who are you making the film for? Who is your target audience? Obviously is believers of whom there are very many who would likely not pirate the film and would organize coach loads of people to visit cinemas to watch the bible come to life, although its already alive to the believers.The acting in the film is good as it has a great cast, the production values are fairly high. But with the poor script, which does not engage the potential 3 billion audience and is aimed at occultists and non bible believers who think the Noah story is a myth or fable, I really don't see the point of this film.I have given the film a very poor rating mainly as it could have been one of the best films of all time, which cold have grossed billions. With the A list cast, production values and technical ability it fails to deliver, due to a silly plot and script written by People who either wanted to ridicule the bible or have never read it and then thought about it deeply.Rob McCrea",Noah

It's truly misrepresented in the trailers which you realize early in the movie. There were not rock creatures in the Bible and Noah was never portrayed as being dark. The most enjoyable part was walking out of the movie realizing that my money was not wasted but should be used to warn others! I recommend you give the $20.00,the price for a couple, to a charitable cause! If you don't know the Bible and are into Science Fiction then you may have a different view than mine.

I am upset for spending money on this nightmare. I can not believe people would actually enjoy watching this movie. The actors must be ashamed to even be in this movie. I thought any movie about religion can not be all bad but I was wrong.

Why they called it Noah is beyond me. They should have made up a fictional title to match the story. It is dark and dirty and reminds me of mad max or water world. there are stupid looking rock creatures that are supposed to be angels who tried to help man and were punished by God. They look something like a cross between an ugly transformer and the sand man off of Spider Man.

1141,kaif23,Complete Garbage- Twisted-from Hell- not biblical whatsoever!,1,28 March 2014,"I eventually got up and left because of how unrelated this story was to the actual story of Noah. It made demons look like good guys that help man, and it made God look like a careless, hateful creator that was eager to just throw man in the garbage. This was not biblical whatsoever. It is a very evil twisted telling of a story that bares some resemblance to the biblical Noah, but is definitely NOT the same biblical Noah story. This story I imagine is the way Satan would want people to believe the story of Noah went since it paints God as a merciless, careless and cold God. That is probably why my stomach turned at how twisted and evil this movie was. God is not cold or careless. His mercy triumphs over His judgment. And this movie also used evolution for the method of God making man from Apes! Completely not biblical either! Completely Demonic! If you have any ounce of desire for goodness or righteousness in your heart or mind, do NOT see this movie! It will only bring you down! It is complete filth, putrid, and poison.

Adding rock elementals as fallen angels? Taking away the fact that Shem was NOT the only one to have a wife? Having Noah go bat**** insane? having someone SNEAK ONBOARD THE ARK AND TRY TO KILL NOAH!?

Horrible!! So many in our theater complained about this movie. We should have gotten up and left, as many did. Even the clerk at the popcorn stand when we got our refill, asked if we liked it, and wasn't surprised that we hated it!

1144,willjbdavis,Boring. Weird. Lame.,1,29 March 2014,"I have never been disappointed leaving a movie before. (I expected Transformers 3 to suck and be boring, and it was). However there is a first thing for everything and Noah was that first. I was OK with the whole ""Grimm Fairy Tales meets the Bible"" take, I was OK with all the 'supernatural witch doctor get high to get a vision' crap. But about right when the flood started, when Noah makes a critical decision finding his son in the woods while fleeing (I won't spoil it for you) I lost all interest because the movie took a turn for the worst, becoming utterly predictable and incredibly boring, not to mention downright twisted. The decision to have the plot evolve that way was a failure. Not a single person leaving the packed (literally not one empty seat) thought it was good, the entire atmosphere was filled with bitter disappointment. The movie became long and boring. Just like this review is becoming. If you like a storyline about ""Man does not deserve the earth"", ""Man ruins everything he touches"" then this movie is for you.",Noah
1145,Kateincarolina,Do five minutes of research before you augment this film's box office,1,29 March 2014,"I knew months ago based on synopses in the press that this (cough) 'Biblical epic' straight outta Hollywood would likely make me want to put my eyes out halfway through. Though actually that happened within like the first ten minutes! Impressive. I'll say this for the film makers. They've got balls. Either that or an utter lack of shame. It takes a particularly noxious brand of narcissism to remake a story from a book many regard as Scripture into a vehicle for espousing lefty political views that have zero to do with Noah of the Bible or God's reasons for sending the flood. For all you complaining about this film (however justifiably!), five minutes of research could've spared you the highly unpleasant experience of having to sit through this mess. Some of us had no choice in the matter having been dragged to the theater by an insistent younger relative who wanted to see 'Hermione.' (She promptly wanted to leave also.) My advice would be not to support this offensive train wreck of a film if you have an ounce of fondness or respect for the Biblical story.",Noah

The director and the writers should have at least checked the history and read their Bibles before making a movie!!! Its 139 minutes of nonsense. Seriously! Many Christians, Jews and Muslims believe that Noah was a righteous man of God. But this film depicts him to be a person with psychological disorder who goes on to kill his grand-daughters just to save ANIMALS??! Are animals more important than Humans, who have been made in the IMAGE of GOD??? And does the Watchers A.K.A Fallen Ones help Noah build the Ark, and finally return to Heaven??? Its because of them and Satan the Fall of Man took place in the Garden of Eden in the first place! They found no mercy in the sight of God because they corrupted the D.N.A of Humans by mating with women and corrupted their minds with war devouring each other!There are many many faults in the story-line of the movie regarding the wives of the three sons of Noah, story of the fallen ones etc. Personally I felt this movie is not at all worth watching!",Noah
1147,niemanns,How About No(ah),3,29 March 2014,"Where to begin. I had heard mixed reviews about this movie, and now I see why. First, I'll go through the pro's: -The acting, on the whole, is very well done. Russell Crowe does well in portraying a confused, but loyal Noah.Jennifer Connelly (as Noah's wife) has her moments as well. Anthony Hopkins plays Methuselah, a character that drugs Noah so he can have a vision, and demands berries throughout the movie. Emma Watson shone as Ila, the adopted daughter of Noah and the wife to Shem. Finally, Ray Winstone plays Tubal-Cain very well, and cannily seems to mimic the devil in the garden of Eden to Noah's middle son, Ham. -The cinematography was very well done too. Though very rough and hostile, the setting for the film is wildly beautiful.-There are a few very touching scenes. Notice I say a few. Now for the cons: -Darren Aronofsky murders the doctrine of angels, in such a way that the fallen angels fell to earth because they felt pity for man. (What? Yes. I snorted too.)Now the angels are gigantic rock-encrusted monsters, that hate all men except for Noah. There is no reason for them being kind to Noah, but somehow they are, and basically build the Ark for him.-Darren Aronofsky directed the movie ""The Black Swan."" But I digress.-The movie is so, so violent. Of course, there is a battle at the Ark as the rain starts to pour (Tubal-Cain got convinced of the apocalypse very quickly maybe? Yes/No?)but there is also probably five straight minutes of girls being kidnapped in the streets of the nearby city, Tubal-Cain and Noah beating at each other, and of course eventually, Ham murders Tubal-Cain. Which brings us to the worst character in the entire movie...-Ham, played by Logan Lerman. From the very beginning, Ham is the odd one out. In the first bit of the film, where young Ham and Shem go out gathering with Noah, Ham picks a flower, and is reprimanded by Noah. They then see a weird armadillo-like dog animal wounded by an arrow in the wilderness. It dies, and later on Noah tells his wife that little Ham was 'too interested' in that. When Ham is older, Lerman slips into the character as a child who wants to be a man. He sees Shem and Ila happy together, and begs Noah to go find him a woman. He sneaks off and finds a girl in the city, right as the soldiers start to storm the Ark. She, however, becomes trapped, and Noah will not save her. She dies a horrible death. Ham then hides Tubal-Cain in the Ark, trying to get him to kill Noah.-The mindless and cruel killing of this girl not only makes the audience somewhat hate Noah, but it makes them nervous for more violence to come. -It quickly becomes clear that Noah has decided that the human race should die out, because all they've done on earth is destroy and try to conquer it. He lets Ham's girl die because he does not want his children to reproduce. He only lets Ila come on board the ark because she is barren. There is a very macabre scene where Noah describes to his children in which order they will die. But Ila was cured of her barrenness, which leads to another set of cons: -Making out and stripping in the woods. -A childbirth scene, the screaming in which we have not seen in Emma Watson since her Harry Potter days. -Noah deciding that if Ila's child is a girl, he will kill her, because that would be someone who could potentially be a mother. Now, just guess. GUESS what Ila has. Twins. Girls. Ouch. So now, in the most shocking and, truly terrible scene, Ila takes her babies up on the roof of the Ark, and Noah chases her up, with a knife, to kill her babies, because he thinks that is what God wants. Ila, crying hysterically, begs Noah to let her calm her babies before they are killed. He allows, so (in the best acting of the entire movie)Ila sings her babies to calm, shaking and crying the whole time, while Noah stands close with a knife over her. She begs him to do what he must do quickly. Of course he doesn't, but the fact that he'd be ready to was horrifying. The rest of the movie is more than depressing...after Tubal- Cain tries to kill Noah, Ham (who had hidden Tubal-Cain in the boat to begin with, why?) kills him, and as soon as the Ark lands, he hikes away, seeing that he doesn't belong. Noah becomes a drunk, and though he eventually breaks free of it, it isn't the same. The movie ends with him reconciling himself to the facts that maybe humans aren't that bad, and telling his remaining family to 'be fruitful and multiply'. Is Noah an accurate representation of the bible story? No.Is it an uplifting story, worthy of thought and praise? Not really. Are there certain characters that shine through the mess of the plot? Yes. There are a few redeeming glints from this film, but not enough that I would want to see it again. No, Noah is not a film that people should call deep. Dark? Yes. But hopeful? Full of joy? Merciful? It lacks all three.",Noah
1148,adriennejns16,What bible did the writer and producer read to come up with this?,1,29 March 2014,"What a way to water the word of God down for profit. What gives ""Hollywood"" the right to change the word of God? Who authorized them? I marked my calendar to see this movie thinking I was going to see a true biblical account and was stunned at what I saw. Really?...Who were the rock people? I don't recall them in the bible. God's word does not need additives. It stands alone. Why does man feel God need our help to tell His story? Pride and ego comes first and then the fall of man. Why did this movie feel like some fantasy? I didn't feel that way when watching The Passion Of Christ or any other biblical movie. For awhile I wondered If they were going to even mention God. After all....these are his words. Shame on Hollywood to always be more concerned about the revenue a movie will generate as oppose to a factual account when it comes to the word of God. You should have read Revelations 22:18-19 where God warns about adding or taking away from the word of God. Woe to that man or men. SMH",Noah
1149,bergerman1981,Overall I thought the movie was done well,7,31 March 2014,"My wife and I watched Noah with a group of our friends. And from hearsay, by that evening I already knew I wasn't going to see a literal narrative.Without going into details and spoiling the movie for anyone I'll briefly review: The first act of the movie was my favorite; Darren Aronofsky's presentation and perspective introducing Noah and the antediluvian world was a visual masterpiece and certainly deserves the credit. In act two the film begins to veer from the biblical narrative (so don't be surprised). I believe the movie could have been perfect had there been a couple adjustments; e.g. Noah saving Ham's love interest; having grownup sons and daughters on board. This segment—however—presents the most thought-provoking concepts both psychologically and spiritually in the movie. So consider the humanity of the characters up to this point. The final act of the film draws back to chapter nine of Genesis. Here we see Noah coping with the massive burden he carried, but there is still hope for mankind at the end.Overall I enjoyed the film, though I feel it had potential to be great. If you like other movies by Darren Aronofsky I think you'll like Noah. As a rule of thumb: criticize the movie after you watched it and don't expect to see a line for line narrative of Genesis. Lastly, please read the Bible yourself and don't always expect movie adaptations to be entirely accurate. Shalom Shalom",Noah

I just wonder why he has to change the story line from the Bible since he titled it to one of the most prominent characters of the book. Nowhere in the Bible says Noah visited any ""shaman"" to hear from God, that too after consuming some potion or drug. It is never mentioned anywhere in the Bible about ""watchers"" helping Noah.

1152,lenathetraveler,Deeply stupid,1,29 March 2014,My friends and I decided early on in this film that the best approach was to treat it as farce and try to giggle at it. That didn't work for long; We ultimately had to leave regardless. Many of the moviegoers around us looked like they'd been shot. Deeply hacked off. Can't blame them since this film is about as offensive and off base as it gets compared to the Biblical story. It was mostly a bizarre hodgepodge of tired PC themes and well-worn hackneyed characters and devices which didn't help matters. One of the most troubling and unenjoyable nights I've spent in a theater in recent memory.,Noah
1153,Wingincamera,Noah: A science fiction fantasy,2,29 March 2014,"Noah The movie ""Noah"" and the flood. If you have never heard of the Bible and the story the flood, then you ""might"" like this movie as a science fiction fantasy, like the recent Marvel comic book movies. Other than having the same name, a boat and lots of water, the movie has no other relationship to what is revealed in the Bible. I guess the ""Watchers"" are suppose to be fallen angles, who somehow are let back into heaven, because we certainly wouldn't to suggest there is a ""hell."" In this movie, the Creator is not the same God I read about in the bible, and the reason for the flood is totally wrong. There are extra people in the ark, extra doors & windows. What takes place during the flood inside the ark is total fiction, along with most of the movie. Like I stated above, this is a science fiction fantasy movie, which just happens to have people with biblical names. It is complete fiction, don't waste you time or money.",Noah
1154,tron-crocker,Great Film (even for a Christian),9,29 March 2014,"For those ultra-conservative religious folks out there positing that Noah was dark, gritty, and did not stick to the text you are correct. But as a Christian does any biblical movie stick exactly to the text? Even veggie tales adds jokes and dialogue to stories. The facts of the matter are that whether you are religious (like me, a conservative Christian) or not Noah was a good film. It is true the bible doesn't mention fallen angel rock giants helping Noah, but it doesn't matter because it doesn't affect the themes of the movie. The biblical account talks of man being so depraved that God decides to blot them out and restart. This is the story the movie portrays. It shows how truly evil mankind was trading women for meat, committing sexual abuses, being extremely violent, and the king of the humans even claims he is on level playing field with God (pride). The movie portrays God's character as watchful, the eternal judge, but at the same time loving to Noah and his family. People have many qualms with this movie one being how the Bible speaks of Noahs righteousness not being dark and at some point psychopathic. However, when Noah believes he must kill his grand daughters he stop and does not. This alludes to another biblical story of the sacrificing of Isaac by Abraham. Abraham was counted as righteous because he had faith that the lord knew what was best even when it meant sacrificing his son. is not this the same in noah? did God not know what was best for Noah? Noah can still be a righteous man and be tested he even can mess up because his steadfast faith is what counts as righteousness. The believer should go into this movie and see some core biblical themes Gods grace, Gods love to his faithful servants, Gods wrath, and most of all Gods sovereignty. Throughout the movie Noah is grappling with Gods plan he doesn't know how to go through with some of it, it is impossibly hard for him, and he ultimately is downright confused at points. However, in the end Noah not only remains a faithful servant, but he learns that God chose to preserve his family lineage out of his love. My objection to the religious who have seen it and hated it because it wasn't canonical is why did you expect it to be that way? The film is an interpretation by a director who does an excellent job of presenting core themes throughout the movie. The point of seeing any movie is to make you reflect on yourself. Noah reflect on himself believing he also must die because he is just as cruel and bad as everyone else. This realization that he is as deprived by sin as everyone else is the same thing that led Martin Luther to posit that only by grace alone can man be saved. Doesn't noah teach that? I believe strongly it does. I urge anyone who is capable of thoughtfully thinking about the themes in this film to see it. Not only is it an excellent picture of humanity and struggles of humanity but it also is a good film. It leaves you amazed at some of the cinematography and most of all you leave with questions about yourself which is what any good movie should aim to do.",Noah
1155,kwiggs-961-585178,Disappointed,1,29 March 2014,"I am a movie lover. I am also a Christian. I went to this movie with anticipation, and left feeling ugly. Yes you will either hate it or love it.I hated it for many reasons. Noah was portrayed as a Psychotic. Methuselah was portrayed as some kind of witch doctor. The word ""God"" was never mentioned in the movie. God never ""Spoke"" to Noah in the movie, very evident in the Bible. God told Noah he was going to establish a new covenant with him because he was a righteous man. In the Movie, Noah seems to think God wants to destroy all of mankind including him and his family. I could go on and on. These are just a small percentage of the problems. The director did claim that he has made the most Un-Biblical movie version of a Bible story. He would have gotten 10 stars if that was the assignment I guess. I read he is an Atheist as well. Not positive on that either.Finally, there is a huge difference between poetic license and massacre of the text. Read Genesis 6-9 This Movie was about 5% accurate to the biblical account.They got a few character names right, the big boat, and a flood. The rest of it was bunk.If you are a believer, steer clear of this film.",Noah

Read Genesis and you'll see what I mean.Saving the Planet, saving animals and God's disregard for human life is the REAL storyline - Doesn't even say who the ""Creator"" is and no mention of the relationship he has with mankind and the love he demonstrated for us.

1157,jesse-bowers56,I am a Christian and I loved it. (The rare voice),10,29 March 2014,"It truly breaks my heart that this movie is so polarizing and that the opinions I so deeply disagree with are those of people who claim to be a part my own faith. For those who are reading their comments, please look at them with grace and understand that they are raising their VIEW of the Noah account above the beauty that this movie portrays. You will notice their arguments are usually the same: Noah was not dark, this is a movie about environmentalism, there were no rock creatures, God was not silent...All of this is under girded by a belief that they must warn people against this movie. So to offset what is a perceived as the ""opinion"" of the Christian community here are several reasons why I believe this movie is beautiful. 1) Man went horribly wrong and dominated the world rather than living in harmony with it. This movie captures their depravity so well, that there was no regard for other humans or creation.2) Noah was not chosen because he was righteous, but his righteousness was given to him by God. Noah was not God, he was fallen and subject to his own sins fleshed out later in the movie. But he obeyed God. His obedience before the ark was his care for creation. Then his obedience in building the ark. Followed by blessing man to be fruitful and multiply.3) Creation was perfect, but then subjected to the curse. Noah was the exception to those who objectified creation and abused it. You can toil with nature and work with it without exploiting it.4) God was communicative. He communicated himself in many different ways. At the beginning of the movie, He communicated himself as Creator, then Judge, then Merciful Savior of Creation. 5) It takes an understanding of the Trinity and of the Kingdom to understand that God is using man to care for the world. Creation is groaning, but will be restored and will eventually be renewed. There are men and women of the Kingdom who get that, who are being restored by Jesus, and through that, desire to care well for this world.6) What was judgment for many was salvation for a few. The same waters that destroyed mankind also saved Noah and his family. Aronofsky beautifully displayed the difference between a judgment of fire and a judgment of water. This same ""baptism"" points to the salvation offered by Jesus. So please. Do not lump all Christians into the same basket and think that they cannot find truth or beauty in this work. Aronofsky brings about beautiful truths in Tree of Life and The Fountain and builds on them with this gem. And to understand more about Jesus, Creation, and the renewal of all things, you should read the book of Colossians in the Bible.",Noah

Only Noah's family. If you are gonna do a movie on a bible story - you may want to actually read the bible 1st.Scripture from the Message Bible - it can be easier to understand for those who don't normally read the bibleGenesis Chapter 6 18-21 ""But I'm going to establish a covenant with you: You'll board the ship, and your sons, your wife and your sons' wives will come on board with you. You are also to take two of each living creature, a male and a female, on board the ship, to preserve their lives with you: two of every species of bird, mammal, and reptile—two of everything so as to preserve their lives along with yours. Also get all the food you'll need and store it up for you and them.""22 Noah did everything God commanded him to do.1 Peter Chapter 3 19-22 He went and proclaimed God's salvation to earlier generations who ended up in the prison of judgment because they wouldn't listen. You know, even though God waited patiently all the days that Noah built his ship, only a few were saved then, eight to be exact—saved from the water by the water. The waters of baptism do that for you, not by washing away dirt from your skin but by presenting you through Jesus' resurrection before God with a clear conscience. Jesus has the last word on everything and everyone, from angels to armies. He's standing right alongside God, and what he says goes.",Noah

But before you continue, please be cautioned since what you will be witnessing is the Transformers version of Noah's story. Here comes the time when I simply have to be honest. Very truly, this movie is a rip off from the unknown ""Transformers Bible"" which tells us a story about a different Noah who is accompanied by rock beasts. It is a pity that so many great actors played in a movie which did not portray the Biblical story of Noah. Besides the movie mostly leans towards film effects and not the plot-line itself (which is unfortunately so cacophonous and confusing that people sitting next to me slept). And what does this movie do to the society? Well, it simply makes the consumers to have a completely untrue notion about the story of Noah. This movie was probably made for business and for making your head hurt, and not for true entertainment and commemoration of a story. Please don't consider me as a defender of the Bible, consider me a defender of education and knowledge.

Because of people's deep believe in the bible without reasoning it contents, the world and mentality of the people is so low these days...it is all about materialism and egoism, why, because the bible lacks spiritual information...the bible was made by men for their own benefit and has only little truth in it...very little...! What is the truth is that in that time, that far away time, life conditions were very hard. It needs a very strong man, like e.g. Moses also was, and Noah to lead the people. If you were not strong, you will not succeed...it is still the same today, isn't it, so can you imagine in those days! To me it is and will be an epic film, that will take me through some fine 2 hours and wondering how special effects influence our movies today, again and again its getting bigger and bigger...where is the end! If you want the real truth be told about spiritualism, don't look for outside information like the bible and movies...look into your own soul/heart and pray and meditate daily...and you will find the truth...and about the movies, it is just a story on a screen to enjoy...if you cannot make the difference...just don't go, because you will be disappointed!",Noah

They also distorted the story and lied about what was actually done and said. They distorted even the time it took to do what they were told to do by the Lord.

So once the task of saving the animals is finished his last duty is the kill everyone aboard including the babies.Ridiculous. 2014 Noah has to go down as the worst remake of a known story ever.

1168,ADHDepictions,This movie IS NOT about Noah,7,30 March 2014,"Once Again, Aronofsky doesn't disappoint! I have been anticipating the release of this movie since the production was announced; not because I wanted to see a Bible epic about Noah (it's hard to anticipate a two hour movie based on limited Biblical information) but I was interested to know how such a visionary director, who often reveals deeper thoughts, philosophy, and meanings through story lines and performance, without stating the actual point directly, was going to do so using Noah as a title.This movie is not about Noah. Aronofsky simply uses the well known Biblical story, and the character himself, as a conduit to suggest a more complicated view of humanity. The writers, have taken many liberties with The Verses, and as a Christian, this doesn't bother me due to overall point the film makes about our morality as a race. I believe that anyone who can look beyond the liberties, and understand the purpose of this film, will walk out of the theater with much reflection. Not just on the actions of men, as a whole after the flood, but also on an individual basis regarding the proportionate level of Good versus Evil in their own heart. Cliché, would be appropriate now to state that if only a few individuals make better choices regarding love, or even if one can resist an act of Evil, than this movie has served its purpose.Of course, there are going to be many viewers that use their own religious views to block out the truth of the movie, and I'll have to say, ""Shame on Them"". As a movie-goer, one commits to a journey coursed by the director, and I enjoyed the ride. If one is willing to believe in miracles, then, I truly believe, that individual should also be willing to consider miracles portrayed in fictitious art forms. The truth of a miracle is based on Faith. If this weren't the case, we'd call those miracles Science. There is room for Faith in this film; even if it means putting a two-hour grayness over what one considers black and white. Reflection after the movie can then recreate the polar sides of belief, or hopefully, color the views of an individual on humanity rather than of spirituality (or religion for those who can't distinguish the two).This film is obviously going to bring out many different opinions (I just wrote a paragraph on Biblical interpretation) that aren't often shared in regards to the majority of this art, but separating the art from the artist, or in this case, art from individual belief, this movie has tremendous acting (Jennifer Connelly), incredible cinematography, beautiful vision from the director, and again, a very poignant statement.I won't go into detail with all the scenes I enjoyed, but I would like to state the scenes of creation and how our humanity, not the physical forms, have evolved was brilliant. Please go watch this film, reflect on what wasn't actually stated, and entertain the realization of what choices you've made before, and those you'll make after, watching a two hour eighteen minute interpretation of a well known story.",Noah

So the movie morphed from what I thought would be more of a period piece to sci-fi fantasy. Simply not a good movie and I am a Russell Crowe fan. The other frustrating aspect is that Hollywood cannot resist the temptation of interjecting their version of political correct views trying to influence us the movie going populace.

The script itself is as duplicitous and cynical as the marketing strategy. It's also utterly incoherent, which is not surprising since Aronofsky's approach seems to be to toss in any odious bit of behavior he can useful for painting Noah (and God) as villains and distorting God's purpose with the flood.

Many Bible films have issues, just like many of the films that have those 5 magic words Based on a True Story. Talk to the people who Know the story of Radio, or Coach Boone (Remember the Titans), and the film makers have taken liberties to make the fims ..more interesting. I have the same issue with many of the Moses films (or other Bible based films). This film has an interesting take on the Nephilim, but according to Hebrew legends..these were fallen angels who mated with human female and gave rise to freaks...and also brought to man all forms of sins that would anger God including incest,bestiality, homosexuality.and other sins.

The Watcher Angels were ones that caused a lot of the wickedness due to mating with human females and producing the Nephilim (Giants who were evil and caused much destruction) The watcher angels did not help Noah build the ark. and they did not fly away like the movie shows. Noah's sons all had wives unlike the movie portrayed that only Shem had a wife. The effects on the movie were good but this movie leaves a wrong story in the minds of those who do not read the bible and that is not right. If people want to know the true story, read your bible and you will see Gods truth, not mans lie... Hollywood leads people to believe things that are not true or correct by movies like this.",Noah
1178,mariafleming,Deeply moving allegory for our time,9,30 March 2014,"In some ways a melodrama, Noah exceeds its limitations with its outstanding story telling. Bringing to mind some of the flavour of the nihilistic Cormac McCarthy's The Road, Noah deals with the complex nature of sin and redemption using the well known story of Noah's Ark from the Bible. The strengths of this film are in no small part due to Russell Crowe's intense performance of a gentle man struggling to live in a world seemingly without mercy or innocence. His character's development from a 'good and faithful servant' blindly following the dogmas of his fathers to a man confronting his own nature as a depraved human being and then to acceptance that the god given right of humanity to choose its own destiny for good or evil, is very moving. The strong environmental messages can't be overlooked nor can the two or three impressively rendered visions of hell on earth. Inspired I am sure by paintings from the medieval artist, Hieronymus Bosch. It's not your typical blockbuster nor a work of devotion to a evangelical Christian ideal. But it's a really fine and gripping story.",Noah
1179,pdelaorta,This Movie is a total misleading of the Truth about Noah,1,31 March 2014,"I was really excited to go ans see the Movie of Noah. Who doesn't want to see what happened in real life in History ? More studying the Bible. The movie was OK at the beginning but they are sooo many wrong parts in the Movie. Who wants to see The violence injected to Noah ( Russell C). Noah is one of the 3 people God considered the Bestpeople serving God. Noah was picked from All because of his GOOD heart and because there was no evil or violence in him. How can they just put so much violence in him ? The story is wrong too ! People that don't know about the bible, can be mislead to think God picked up one violent man to be the starter of a new world with evil and with other people saved in the boat that wasn't supposed to be there. Noah didn't travel with the kids and babies. Noah travel with his sons and their wives. It is a total misleading! Make you wonder who really was behind this movie misleading the whole world to think bad of Noah, his Family and God. I am not religious but I know the story and anyone that knows the Story and saw the violence in Noah and their kids got disappointed and I saw many people leaving the movie. I just think If someone is going to do a movie of the Bible. Say the truth on it ! Why mislead people from God, the goodness and the light and insert fear of violence in everyones heads. Just a reminder. God is Love and God is kind. He chosed Noah to survived because He didn't have an evil heart. Read the Bible to really guide yourself of what really is the Story , there is no Noah trying to kill anybody on the bible, less innocent just born babies. It could just be a movie for some, but reality is everyone that doesn't know the truth about what really happened with Noah, could always have the wrong ideas about God , his path and his Love for All. Very disappointed in trying to make GOD , Noah and his family look bad when it is the total opposite. Again I am not fully religious but makes you wonder if Satan is behind the script to put the movie out there to mislead humanity.",Noah
1180,mindlogik,Alas poor Noah,1,31 March 2014,"i have to comment that as a movie addict and cross-genre enthusiast Noah, taken from a graphical novel or biblical point of view left me sitting in my seat like a brain-dead zombie with a very sore gluteus maximus. The plot seems to be a combination of Harry Potter,Lord of the Rings,Conan the Barbarian,300,Hannibal and Crocodile Dundee.An impressive cast of actors but I left feeling that the movie script must have been drafted for each day of filming on the back of a napkin over breakfast. Apart for some good(God?) special effects the movie was not worth the $22 I paid for VMax seats. Wait until it comes out on Netflix. At least you will have the option to turn it off.",Noah

I am not at all surprised that he made this film that provided him with an excuse to bastardise the Biblical story, change its meaning and importance in almost every way imaginable, and insult people of faith the world over. That, at least, I understand and fully expected.What truly disappointed me is that he didn't do the same job on the story of Mohammed in order to sit back and enjoy the fruits of his work. Perhaps he would like to try this as a sequel?Trying to say that the cinematography, acting and music redeems the movie is like saying that the menu for dinner today is sh*t but we will eat it because it is ever so nicely set out on the plate!",Noah

They will be disappointed by the failure to use the word ""God"", strong evolutionary message, and rather than waste peoples time, this movie has nothing to do with the Bible story other than there is a guy named Noah and a flood.

I could get past this with the reason the director gave.However, this film went well beyond that, inserting just enough biblical truth to lend credibility to those who have never read the story, while at the same time twisting the rest to make Noah out to be a complete lunatic.The short message of this movie is that Good works are enough to get you to heaven, and all Christians are completely nuts! There are so many things wrong with this movie that it actually makes me sick when I think about it! I fear for the writer and director of this film! There are verses in the bible that explicitly warn about changing the word of God.In the end, this was an true opportunity that was not only completely wasted, but turned into a destructive force against the Christian faith.I will NEVER again go to a mainstream film about a biblical story.

1186,tozwaldron,The filmmakers must believe in the Tooth Fairy,1,31 March 2014,"Aww, ain't it sweet when the godless heathen try to make nice and assure Christians that they respect our belief in God and His Word? Unfortunately, they never can quite seem to pull it off. I honestly think they view us as stupid. I really do! Methinks they are projecting. Take the example of this new $135 million ""blockbuster"" epic movie that just hit the theaters, Noah. The avowed atheist director, Darren Aronofsky wrote a disclaimer which states: ""The film is inspired by the story of Noah. While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. The Biblical story of Noah can be found in the book of Genesis."" Hmm. The filmmakers must believe in the Tooth Fairy also because from what I've read about what's in this claptrap of a movie, ""truth, values and integrity"" are in short supply! The entertainment industry states they're trying to woo Christians, but this movie is actually a VERY clever ploy to mislead the UN-churched population of sheep into believing things about God, Christianity and Judaism that simply aren't true. Let me give you some examples. Prepare for a spike in your blood pressure. *deep breath* First, the evolutionist agenda of the film is thrown in your face by showing a montage of monkeys and apes, leading up to Adam and Eve. Gee. Who would have seen THAT coming? However, the main gist of the story is steeped in rabid environmentalism. Mankind sinned against the creator, A/K/A 'earth,' by cutting down trees to build dwellings, using wood to build fires to keep warm, strip mining, eating meat, and picking dainty little flowers. No, I'm not kidding. Noah gets stoned on hallucinogens and thinks he hears the creator tell him man and beast will be destroyed because man has abused the earth, therefore he needs to build an ark and save some of the poor, pitiful animals. I didn't realize God was a tree-hugger. There is NO mention of man's depravity, idolatry, violence, evil, or the genetic pollution of the Nephilim, as the reason for the flood. Some of those things are depicted by people ripping animals apart to eat while they're still alive, worship-ping a golden calf and general violence, selfishness and mayhem. But that's not why the creator is disgusted with or judging mankind. No, it's because man abused Mother Earth. Noah severely chastises his young son for picking a flower just because it's pretty, and he kills two people to save an injured animal. According to Breitbart's review of the movie, ""In 'Noah' there is one man who does judge others for being covetous, lustful and some other legitimate sins, but it's not God. It's Noah. And Noah does not see these qualities in the humanity God will wipe out; he only sees them in his own family—the very family God has chosen to survive because of their righteousness."" ""And Noah is portrayed as a dangerous, religious extremist for judging others in this way. It is at this point that he goes off the deep end in a fit of self-righteousness that ends with a promise to murder his own newborn granddaughters."" This movie is nothing more than anti-God and anti-Christian propaganda, serving to continue to further the lie that Christians who are God fearing, Bible believers are dangerous terrorists who are intolerant and violent. The Illuminati shills in Hollywood are doing the bidding of their masters very well. Our wonder Creator, Almighty God is portrayed as an evil, vengeful, hateful being, which makes those of us who love and serve Him the same due to association. In reality, it's the irrational Hollywood mouth foaming, environmental, climate change, 'don't-confuse-me-with-facts,- my-mind-is-made-up freaks,' who are evil, vengeful and hateful. Please, do NOT participate in this farce by buying overpriced tickets to this intestinal swill. Don't waste your money, and by all means tell your friends not to waste theirs either! Let's send the antagonistic, atheistic, mocking Hollywood players a very strong message: You mock us and our God, we'll hit what you worship—your pocketbook!",Noah

It is one thing to make a movie about your take on a biblical story but it is a completely different thing to change the facts and morph it into a psychotic, overly dramatic, sci-fi. On top of that, the special effects were not even sub par. Horrible effects. Having Noah turn into a sadistic child killer was unexpected and uncalled for. I am a Russell Crow fan and this was just horrible and should have never been made. I had a hard time sitting through the movie and wanted to leave several times but stayed to the end in hopes that something would get better, it did not.

First of all fallen angels did not come here to help humanity they came to poison us with lies and deceit and to procreate with human beings not to help save us from ourselves. Next let's talk about building the ark fallen angels did not help with that either, as a matter of fact this movie paints fallen angels as victims to an angry God. They are not victims they disobeyed the laws of God the father and like the makers and producers of this film they will be severely punished. Next, Noah was a drunk before he built the ark not after the flood. Here is the biggest injustice to the Christian community there is a ten minute segment insinuating EVOLUTION. Starting off with a molecule going to fish the land creature the primate and mystically like a gigantic kick in the heart to Christians everywhere to man. This movie also said that the sons of Adam got a relic from Satan and that indeed eve was the one who ate the fruit and only eve. By the way this relic is a snake skin that supposedly blesses whomever it touches which Noah feels he should touch two infants with at the end of the movie. Apparently Satan is revered in this version as are all fallen angels. Now, let's continue onto Cain apparently he is the good guy in all this and Noah is a deranged lunatic who thinks it is okay to kill his own grandchildren and everybody else and Methuselah is a wizard. Now, I expected Hollywood to exaggerate it, but my problem is, is that when I watched it in theaters and walked out nobody else seemed upset like it was okay. It's not okay to change the word of God, it is not okay to revere fallen angels, it is not okay to revere Satan, it is not okay to insinuate evolution in a Christian film.All those that are Christian the devil owns the rights to this film.

The screenplay is what let it down I guess. Depicting a character known to nearly all is a challenge in itself. The question, I'm sure which was asked by the production team was, do we portray Noah as a blessed soul or someone who has been touched but is not sure of the commands coming from above.I'm this process of showing the human elements, quite brilliantly performed by Crowe, the aura is lost. That little mysticism which elevates a story like this to the next plane. Other performance worth a mention are of Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly.I don't think we as movie goers necessarily crib about the artistic liberties which have been taken in the story, but the watchers were a bit too much. Also the the story of Enoch could have been more elaborate to setup the story of Noah, bringing the audience into the mood and setting up the tale.In the end, although the performances were brilliant, and the CGI was great in parts, there was something missing, that soul, that connect with the movie.",Noah

So I entered the cinema expecting an enjoyable movie with solid cinematography, great storyline and good acting - to be expected with the director. Boy was I mistaken - granted the movie is extremely far fetched (next to no authenticity in relation to the book of the bible), what killed it for me was the serious inconsistencies with the character profiling, poor storyline and execution that made me want to leave the cinema midway. For example - Noah is portrayed as an earth loving greenie, protecting plants and life - point understood, but he easily kills people to protect another life? Further, later in the story he is battling internal turmoil as they hear the screams of the people of the earth? If his resolve lead him to kill humans without hesitation, why is his suddenly so challenged?There was no clear cut message, no point to the movie and it seemed to drag on. If the director intended to slide off in a tangent, at least make it exciting to watch. Let me save you the waste of time and advise against watching it.

1195,moiu_especially-you,Just Go With The Creative Flow & Set Aside Your Preconceptions,7,3 April 2014,"Having read & heard a lot of negativity, I have to say I actually liked the movie and was drawn into the totally contrived story line. If you are expecting the Biblical version, however, you will be seriously disappointed. Many Christians have stated they are offended by the portrayals of Noah and his family, but, I am a Christian and found the writers produced a lot of food-for-thought and discussion for the sake of discovery for you and your family, however, the themes presented are beyond children under 13.The writers/producers/director seem to have an agenda. That said, the movie does makes several interesting & thought-provoking point for the viewer who approaches with an open mind, knowing this is a fictitious story line.The movie was well produced and directed. The casting was perfect and Russell Crow, Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson & Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone & the rest of the cast did an excellent job of carrying the story. Although not an Epoch film (i.e. The Ten Commandments), there are several Epic moments. Emma Watson's character (Ilia)ties the elements of the movie all together in her simple statement to Noah at the end of the movie and it was a touching and thought-provoking scene. The concept of Fallen Rock Angels was kind of bizarre, and both my son and I laughed out loud, but like I told my son when they appeared (they are a huge part of the story)--""it's fiction, (part sci-fi, part philosophical) so just Go With It, lol."" This is the major indicator that what you are watching is totally fictitious, although quite entertaining once you set aside your preconceptions and 'Go With The Flow' of the story and the writers' & director's imaginations. There was just enough mix of the miraculous (some presented in practical ways and some totally miraculous) promoting Faith over Fear and Good over Evil, and the conflict that happens within each of us in deciding which is which, including God's Prophets. You will enjoy it if you go for entertainment's sake and/or the thought-provoking elements the movie provides, and not seeking affirmation of your Biblical or pre-conceived religious beliefs.",Noah

Not that two wives were born on the Ark. 2. The Bible never mentions a stow away. 3. The Bible says that Methuselah died in the year of the flood not because of the flood which is what happens in the Movie. 4. The Bible never says anything about giant stone creatures that were punished Angels guarding Noah and the building of the Ark. 5. No where is it mentioned that Noah was given a magical seed from the Garden of Eden that would magically grow all of the trees used to build the Ark. 6. It makes Noah seem to be ignorant of the fact that he was not only saving the Animals but also mankind through his family and it make him seem like he was cold and ruthless.

Emma Watson has proved her worth, that apart from Harry Potter, she can outshine any other role she gets. It is a very different movie and has a unique story. The movie overall is really heart-touching with beautiful emotions carved out out of every moment. Jennifer Connelly plays her role beautifully as Noah's most trusted follower. Logan Lerman does well, proving that he is a good actor too and can do a variety of roles. Anthony Hopkins as always does full justice to his character Methusellah. Douglas Booth is not bad, he does justice to his role too. The film's storyline is one of the most innovative story lines ever created and there are some really inspiring dialogs.

1203,lovegoldenkate,100% Accurate would've been more interesting...,2,3 April 2014,"I'm a regular guy in my thirties. I'm a Christian and go to church from time to time. Here's my take on the movie Noah. First the positives and then its issues.There were a few messages in the film I viewed as positive. It doesn't question the idea of a Creator but rather simply assumes there is a God. The movie also conveyed certain positive values such as the benefit of listening to God, the portrayal of God's nature as loving and forgiving, and family loyalty. It also does not shy away from the fact that mankind has fallen and needs saving.Unfortunately, there are many issues with this film that do not portray the ""essence, values, and integrity"" of the Biblical account. Many parts were either completely made-up or flat out opposite to what the Bible says. Here are a few examples: 1) The movie references fallen angels who turned into rock people. Aronofsky may have gotten inspiration from the Nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6:4, but the idea that there were angels who tried to help Adam and Eve in the garden who then fell to the earth and turned into rock people is blatantly made-up and not in the Bible at all.2) In the Bible, Noah's three sons all had wives, and they all brought their wives with them on the boat.  The scene where Noah lets the girl get trampled while grabbing his son is incorrect - as they all had their wives with them (Genesis 7:13).3) The Bible gives no account of the birth of twins from one of the girls on the boat, and Noah certainly did not try to kill anyone. This film portrays Noah as homicidal, while the Bible says he was a just man and walked with God (Genesis 6:9).4) The bad guy sneaking on the ship - not in Bible.5) The evolution scene is not Biblical. Species do adapt to their environment, but God spoke all living things into being. Nothing evolved from one thing into another (Genesis 1).6) Overall - the big error.  Noah's was not charged by God to decide whether the human race would continue or not.  It was not Noah's choice, as the movie depicts, to make that decision.  God's reasoning behind the flood was not to eradicate humankind. He was grieved in His heart because of man's continual evil. Noah was charged by God to save his family and the animals and re-populate the planet with humans. Noah accomplished this directive.  God desires relationship with us and ultimately sent Jesus as a way to reconcile us to Himself.While Aronofsky and Paramount have the right to make and release what they want, there is a huge difference between taking artistic license and completely misrepresenting the facts. Calling this movie Noah is a disservice to the general public. Many people who watch this film will leave the theater thinking the Bible says something it doesn't at all.  By the way, one last area which is an issue to me is on the topic of faith.  Noah was a man of faith.  God gave him a vision, and he acted on it, trusting what God told him even though he didn't understand the why or how.  Noah persevered.  So, in addition to the above, the movie also misses the role and importance of faith in being led by God.  Hebrews 11:7",Noah
1204,jrussell8978,Did not float my boat,1,22 April 2014,"This is a terrible movie, and apologies to all those who put some effort into its production, but ... this is a terrible movie!It is a re-telling of the Noah and the ark story from the bible. Noah is portrayed as a grumpy tree-hugger, periodically getting into scraps with equally bad-tempered locals. At some point he agrees to build an ark ... have to say my mind had wandered off at this point, and I'm not too clear about how this came about ... it's that kind of movie. The bible, incidentally, is pretty much thrown out of the window (see 'rock-monsters' below). The makers' effort could surely have been put to better use making some sci-fi flick with similar themes.My main impressions after sitting through it were:(1) Humourless. Bad movies based on bad ideas can sometimes lift themselves a bit if there are some laughs thrown in. Not here. Russell Crow is grumpy throughout and the other actors look utterly miserable. Anthony Hopkins hams it up well as Methuselah and at least looks like he is trying to have a good time, but his feint enthusiasm just reinforces the suspicion that everyone knows the movie is a dead duck.(2) Dark. So much happens in darkness. With the music droning monotonously, barely changing a note, I so wanted to have a nap.(3) Rock-monsters? Rather an ""I don't believe it!"" moment when they appeared in the opening scene. What the **** are they? Robots? Imperial Walkers? Ed209s? Galaxy Quest? .... Rock-monsters? This must be from some other bible I haven't read yet.(4) Special effects are poor, certainly considering the $125,000,000 spent. One waits (longs) for the flood to happen, and when it does ... Ssssploooosh! Was that it?So, not many point from me. I hope this does not torpedo the credibility of Crowe, Watson, etc., as actors who can deliver, given a good script and competent direction.On the good side ...",Noah

There's *zero* Scriptural basis for such a vile representation of an honorable man special to God. Even non-religious moviegoers around here are commenting on the moral vacancy of this film. (And BOY is it dumb.)The writer/director is so preoccupied with cramming his agenda down the viewers' throats, the script doesn't even make a basic level of sense.

A movie of this cast and budget should be able to entertain anyone, instead it was a caricature of Christian propaganda movies. I've seen better paliwood movies.Do not rent this movie.

They've turned a wise and faithful patriarch of three faiths (described as ""blameless"" in his conduct) into a deranged psychopath. What's stunning is that it *never seemed to occur* to an actor boy like Crowe that anyone would be perturbed by this! He keeps trying to explain why WE'RE the ones who have have a misperception of Noah, not him! Like the atheist writer/director and a bunch of high-school-educated actors are more qualified to tell PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY PRACTICE THESE FAITHS and who, you know, VOLUNTARILY read the Bible (like on purpose!) what Scripture has to say about Noah. Maybe I should just beat feet out to Hollywood, get an agent, and sit around sipping lattes and surfing on my phone until that instant M.Div that comes by virtue of being in the industry descends upon me like a dove!This film I'm sad to say most definitely came from the other place.

1209,Diandtony,So disappointing,1,4 April 2014,"The movie is just so bad on so many levels. Nothing the actors could do would save this truly pathetic script. The trailers for the movie do not give you any idea of the silliness of the storyline - for instance, giant rock Transformers, formerly Fallen Angels, helping Noah build the ark! Russell Crowe tries hard, but without anything of substance to work with script-wise, he came across as a confused, angry, despot. The baddies were really bad, the ark really big, and lots of CGI animals of course, and it was just so horribly predictable - sort of part Tolkein, part Transformers, and part Sunday School. A total disappointment - some people actually walked out before the end, and there were lots of chuckles in the theatre at some of the more ""dramatic"" parts of the film. However, on a serious note - movies cost money to see, and I felt I totally wasted mine with this one. Probably one of the worst I've seen.",Noah

Hope everyone involved is real proud of themselves for this assault on one of the most decent personages in the Bible. That rock-bottom CinemaScore of C- is fairly unprecedented and a pretty good indicator of what moviegoers think about your product here. Box office for this film has done a *freefall,* already down 67% from last weekend, now that word of mouth has come into play and done an end run around that misleading trailer.

I couldn't even stay for the ending. If it was intended to be even close to historically correct, it miss it by a long shot. The rock guys and the part that shows the evolution of mankind crawling up out of the ocean was terrible. The special effects was even worse. The budget for this movie must have been at the bottom. What happen to the other two wives of Noah's sons? Where did they get the material for this movie? I could have done better myself and I know nothing about making movies.

The fact that Hollywood would think it okay to make a film about a man whom we assume walked the earth, but cast a European looking man when the Bible story from which it is taken is African is a liberty. Lest we forget Shem and Ham are said to be the fathers of the other native Africans. This is not a dis to white people - some of my closest friends in the world are white and I happen to think Russell Crowe is a fine actor - but I find it abominable that in 2014 the creators of these films still can't find it in their hearts - or brains for that matter - to recognise 'black' people as being an equally important part of human history.

God clearly speaks to Noah and tells him what to do- he doesn't have to guess it, figure it out, or dream itand that's just the small differences I could go on and onI won't even start on the Nephilims!) it just lacked something. The acting was bland, and they focused way too much on Emma Watson (which again an adopted daughter wasn't in the Bible)I mean you have Jennifer Connelly, who's great, and beautiful eye candy Douglass Booth and you hardly put them in the movie?

God is not even mentioned and where on earth did they get the story about the hitch hiker. I am a born again Christian and it did not move me at all in fact some part's are so far from the truth it was farcical. it also showed them running in and out of the ark but the door was shut until the last bird came back showing that there was dry land.

1215,awayigonow,Should've been called 'Darren' instead. A vanity project and a greenie agenda piece.,1,6 April 2014,"This film is a visual manifestation of Aronofsky's personal wet dream of a society: a place in which industrialization is vanquished, flora and fauna are elevated above people, and God is loathsome and disregarded. It's unfortunate that the director chose to hijack one of the more noble of the patriarchs in the Old Testament as a vehicle for espousing a world view that is purely his own. Attempting to elevate your personal beliefs to the level of Scripture by essentially rewriting the Bible takes some brass, I'll give him that much. The protagonist here has as much in common with the Noah of the Bible as Aronofsky does. Surprised he didn't really go for broke on grabbing big box office and just call it 'Harry Potter and the Really Really Big Boat"" instead. What with all the magic bean and magic grandpa jazz thrown into the mix, not to mention Hermione Granger in her skinny jeans already aboard. That would be about as legitimate as calling it 'Noah'. Really the whole thing amounts to a pretty dreadful agenda film that does a real disservice to the titular character.",Noah

Even though I still find the BIBLE the greatest book ever written, and love to watch anything about the BIBLE. With that said. This has got to be the worse movie about anything in the BIBLE I have ever seen, I don't think a SI-FI writer could have wrote a more unbelievable movie. I mean it is so far away from anything the Bible has said about the flood. Everything is just so impossible to even think this could ever happen.

(Please note that I am not religious by the way) but I am still aware that there was no mention of transformers or ""Lord of the Rings"" like magic in the bible.

1220,victoriousever,"This film is not for everyone, heres why....",10,6 April 2014,"As a Muslim and a strong believer, I had actually read up the biblical and Islamic versions of the great flood in great detail before I happened to watch the movie and i know that biblical stories are slightly different accounts to those of the Islamic ones but sometimes they are very similar and other times they are very different.So keeping that in mind, I went to the cinema not to educate myself on what happened as I already knew what happened and 2 different versions of it. I went into the cinema to visualise and imagine what the accurate parts of the movie would have been like in real life, while I discarded the inaccuracies. And perhaps thats why I totally loved this film and found so many scenes compelling and heart breaking. I know a lot of people are complaining about its inaccuracies and how things are not even close to the real biblical accounts. But perhaps thats not the point of the movie. This movie for me did not just depict the pain and suffering Noah endured, but also highlights how Jesus, Moses, Abraham and Muhammad (pbuh) and many other prophets suffered in their struggle to deliver the creators message. What I derived from the movie was as follows:All the prophets that walked the earth, were common men like us in many many ways. They had friends, families, homes and a life. And when God called upon them to deliver his message, they sacrificed everything to answer his call. They left their homes, faced ridicule, boycott, starvation, physical and mental torture, and migrated to places they had never heard of. They were pressurised by friends, families, their own children and their community to abandon their ideology. And yet they didn't cave in. That's how strong they were in their faith.The scene where Noah decides against all his families will, to kill any newborn on the ark to fulfill God's will was obviously not accurate to either biblical or Islamic accounts, but it did depict what some of our prophets went through.For example, when God commanded Abraham to leave his wife and son( the son born out of a barren mother after Abraham cried and prayed to God for very long)in the middle of a dessert...imagine his horror....he was to leave his family in the middle of a dessert where there's water nor food. It was guaranteed death, And yet he put his faith into Gods hand and did as God had willed. It highlights inner psychological battles our prophets faced, such as Moses when he took the tribe of Israel to the sea to save them, and when his tribe saw the water they called him a traitor, and shouted absurdities at him, claiming he had trapped them, that he walked them hundreds of miles in order to get them all killed. And Moses stood there ...waiting for an answer from God....for instructions...and there was a long wait...and he did not know what was to happen. Similar to the scene where Noah stands on top of the Ark, waiting for a revelation, some guidance, any guidance...and there is none. It breaks your heart to put yourself in his place. And to know as a believer that many prophets stood at the same crossroads at various points in their lives, where there was no more revelation, no more instructions and they had to act upon their instincts to do the right thing. It brought tears to my eyes.As a Muslim, I discarded all the blasphemy, and took on board the message. This film gave me a lot of inspiration, strengthened my faith in my religion, and raised my respect for the greatest people that God chose to deliver his message. This movie is not for people that don't believe in religion, or the holy books. To them it will just be a CGI movie that failed to deliver what the trailer had promised. But for me, a believer with an open mind, it was a beautiful depiction of some of the accounts of the great flood.",Noah

1225,beebeeebay,So bad. Just bad.,2,7 April 2014,"I've heard a lot about why Christians hate this movie. Being an atheist, I can see why both sides would hate it. As someone who was aware it was based on the bible story but didn't really want to see a film where the heavy focus was on religion, I feel I was misled by the trailer- which only shows the action parts of the film- which take up about 10% of the actual movie. So Christians will hate it because it's unfaithful to the bible, and atheists will hate it because they were conned into seeing a heavily religious movie. (Before you say it- yes I KNOW it's based on a religious story. But it's far more heavily laid on than in the trailer, which is more like an epic action film trailer.) Most of the screen time is taken up with pointless things that are never explained, like magic snake skins and glowing rocks that can apparentley create fire and guns. Oh, also there appears to be an abandoned mine with industrial revolution level technology which nobody in the film seems to possess- as rightly they shouldn't in biblical times. Also, Noah is basically a massive dick who is apparentley a vegan (nobody gets that built on a vegan diet) who cares about the sanctity of life, but casually kills people and leaves a girl to be trampled to death without a second thought. The production values on the film are bad- the credits and ending sequence looks like it was made in the 90s- I can only assume this was on purpose? The last third of the film is taken up with a moral dilemma of whether to kill two baby girls or keep them so they can have incest babies with their uncles. Nice. I wouldn't recommend anyone of any faith watching this movie. It says something to me that it has a high critics rating but a terrible audience one.",Noah
1226,eclipsedenube,Noah himself is the biggest issue on this disgusting movie.,2,7 April 2014,"Hi from Argentina. On an uneven Sunday afternoon I managed to keep us 4 members of my family together and seated at the cinema. Many hours later I'm still regretting myself for not reading reviews previously and warn ourselves to change our agenda and avoid this non-stop 138 min of mental violence. We are four new-born Christians, we feel blessed, we are indeed. Despite what you believe in or your religious status, let me tell you that my wife and myself felt so annoyed, I mean we really tried so hard to stay seated all along this film to an end that seemingly never comes. First (of many) and biggest problem is that this main role should not have been called Noah, there should not have been any (at all) minimum bible reference, there should have not been the slightest mention of our Creatror nor any of His work process or any biblical people names. Director should have placed instead action on somedevastated earth in near future due to some ridiculous class - B sci cheap horror film stone monsters, (Director: in three words they are laughable) builds himself sort of retro-future spaceship and fights all alone against hundreds of misadventures. To put in simple words, acting roles are mostly great, special FX are top notch, and little more to add to the positive side. Trailers will not warn you about, disrespectful ""reading"" of Genesis book of the Holy Bible, enormous amount of violence of all kind, hate, loads of hate in many forms, weirdness.

1227,asinner117,Great movie with a not-so-great rep,8,7 April 2014,"I've read a lot of reviews for this movie, and it irritates me to see so many people say that they were ""honest"", yet they are judging the movie based on something it doesn't even claim to do. This movie does not claim to be the accurate representation of the Biblical story of Noah. As a Christian who studies the Bible, I was able to go to this movie and genuinely enjoy it for what it is rather than looking at it for what it doesn't have.Being made by an Atheist director, I did expect to be a little offended at the movie's portrayal of Noah. However, the more I watched, the more I began to appreciate it. No, most of the events in the story are not Biblically accurate. Yes, some things are added in, like the watchers and the conflict with the Canaanites. But all of these things were used to reinforce the theology of the Noah story, not take away from it. The watchers are real things talked about in 1 Enoch, which is not part of the Protestant Bible, so I don't hold it to be true. But it is significant that Jude mentions the book. The descendants of Cain were not portrayed as fighting against Noah, but the whole idea of the story was to show that the world was wicked and needed to be punished. The movie did a great job of using them to show the depravity of the world and why God had to flood the world. All of these are major deviations from the Bible, but the movie never says it is trying to be perfectly accurate. Instead what I see is a movie in which the director did his research and kept the theology of this part of Genesis the same while taking some creative liberty to bring out those ideas.Now as for the movie itself, it kept me watching. I felt that the last 30 minutes dragged a bit, but the plot was interesting, and I really enjoyed the portrayal of the characters. Noah's struggles to handle the task given to him was well done. The main problem I do have, however, is toward the end when Noah either had to choose whether or not to kill the child. The movie ends up pitting Noah against God in this part, but in the Bible, nothing like this happens. Noah is someone who does every last thing God asks, but does not have to do any of the killing himself. Overall, however, I did enjoy seeing the depiction of the way the events took place. It is not Biblically accurate, but it is a very interesting story and makes points that are not immediately evident, but are relevant to the real story.",Noah

However, the story itself is historically inaccurate. According to some religions and faith, Noah's character is misrepresented. Three words to represent the story: Blasphemy sacrilegious desecration. Noah is shown to be confused. He only cares (according to this film) about saving animals and birds. Monstrous creatures (Watchers) help him build his arc. He is shown to care only about saving non-human creatures. In truth, this is not what happened. Noah had tried his best to bring his people to their senses. Anyone who followed him under the guiding light of God, and obeyed, was allowed on the arc and saved. Further more, Noah's wife and children here, are shown to be the innocent victims of his cruelty. In reality, his wife and son were evil and disobedient, not the innocent victims portrayed here in this film.

As a person whom has studied paganism and the etc writings as well a the bible, Hollywood and politics I think this movie is meant to confuse and mislead people. If you are a Christian unversed on the bible I highly suggest you read the bible first at least this story. What's the deal with trying to promote environmentalism, with the story of Noah??? God destroyed the world before not because we were over populating it, or destroying the tree's (there were fare more back then than now) he destroyed it because we were wicked. And yes they did eat meat,at that time too in fact animals were once sacrificed to God. It's like they want to promote the worship of things on earth. God made the earth and yes we should respect it, but not worship it. We should not be afraid to multiply after all God told us to multiply. As for the rich film makers of this film scared that they will lose there mansions, and food. God also told us not to worry about what we should eat or wear today or tomorrow, God would provide. Man does not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. In this movie they added a lot of extra stuff. The watchers are of paganism not Christian texts. I dislike the fact that they paint God in this angry, vengeful way. Making it look like he would make a grandfather kill his own granddaughters, that was added, and not in the scripture. God is merciful, good and most understanding. Hollywood and leaders I advise you not to be changing the word of God for your own agenda's it's not good for you. On the upside, The costumes and graphics were good. Next time try sticking to the real story and try not to add.",Noah
1231,wordleman,What makes Noah so comprehensibly horrendous is that it is appalling storytelling.,2,11 April 2014,"After the initial roll-out of Noah appeared to be mired in controversy over it's bastardization of the Biblical text, the producers understood that unless the criticisms were not quickly mollified, the real disaster about to be played out on the American screen would be a 150 million dollar box-office flop.Though money cannot guarantee a blockbuster success, the marketers of Noah wisely reasoned it could be invested into helping persuade the mavens of Christendom to appreciate the broad-minded perspective of it's creator, Darren Aronofsky. If schmoozed and treated just right, they might find their way to seeing Noah not as originally crafted by its creative moguls, but as Aronofsky so desperately now needed them understand what he intended all along...After so many men and woman I greatly respect offered their praise of the film, I was all the more motivated to see Noah. Furthermore, from what I read, I was all but certain that the greatest challenge in reviewing Noah would be in selecting just the right superlatives. Regrettably, I could not have been any more misled. Borrowing a line from A Fish Called Wanda, disappointed!First the good. The flood is astonishing. I don't recall ever seeing such an accurate and thrilling orchestration of God's deluge and the ark consumed by its furry. If this extravaganza alone is worth the price of a ticket and munchies, Noah will be a delight.Acting was grand to sufficient. Russell Crowe, who never founders, was magnificent. The remaining cast gave acceptable performances. I was especially impressed by Ray Winstone as Tubil-cain. His vigor is palpable!So much for the good.If you're anything like me, and need something more than thrilling special effects and good acting, like possibly a plausible story and a hero you actually like (let alone root for), you may struggle to remain in your seat.It's not that Noah is bad, it's downright dreadful.So then, what's so awful? I'm somewhat at a loss to say. It's not that I'm confused as to what makes Noah a plodding, pretentious film, but rather struggling with the degree of the monstrosity, which begs the question, where does one begin? Had I the time and interest, and didn't respect your time, I'd write volumes. But this is a blog post. So, I'll make a few pithy observations and call it a review. You'd think for all the contentious aspects over the retelling of Noah that the controversy might be the reason it's a terribly crafted film. But it's not. What makes Noah so comprehensibly horrendous is that it is appalling storytelling. It's not that the writers are faulted for being unskilled, but rather for concocting unconvincing character motivations and then clumsily weaving a tumefied agenda into the fabric of an already message laden narrative. For instance, of all the diverse wickedness a movie might expose regarding the depraved proclivities of a culture (for which God is enraged and will soon annihilate them as punishment), which might you think are at the fore? Okay, get your mind out of the gutter and feast your eyes on what Aronofsky contends is the single most cogent rationale for the obliteration of man: they're carnivores! That's right, the greatest depiction of this evil in Noah is that man eats other beasts.The other unforgivable immorality Noah extracts from the pages of Genesis is not only that these malevolent hordes eat meat, but they wage war on women. How? They exchange woman for animals, which they then viciously eat (not the woman but the animals). Obviously, commoditizing women is immoral. However, it was plain that Aronofsky was not so much telling us a tale about Noah as he was dipping us in his well of leftist politics. Odd that I kept seeing flashbacks of Avatar while watching this behemoth disaster. Among the closing scenes, stock footage was inserted depicting contented animal pairs against the backdrop of bucolic fields and gentle breezes. I don't know what was worse, these bunglingly mawkish green-screen clips or the clownish animation sequences. Regardless, all were painful to watch. As to the ad campaign that boasts Noah ""is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide,"" it is categorically false. It's not that Noah simply adds embellishments to augment Biblical principals, Aronofsky makes a pronounced u-turn and transmogrifies the story of Noah into neither the teaching or man we read in scripture.Bottom line, Aronofsky preaches that man is more merciful than God. How? Aronofsky portrays God as the one who is the real sick old fart who can learn a thing-or-two from Noah's compassionate family. Although Noah believes God has required him to slaughter the innocent, twin baby girls born upon the ark (as well as his family, no less), he finally succumbs to family pressure, siding with ""mercy"" rather than God's justice. Thus, in one fell swoop, Noah is bigger and better than God, which of whom we get the feeling Noah made after his own likeness all along. This is humanism folks - plain and simple.So, regardless of the what the filmmakers cite about being faithful to the ""true essence"" of the Biblical story, I'd venture to say that trusting in man's judgment and his sense of morality is not what the Bible has in mind when it says, ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and rely not on your own understanding."" Proverbs 3:5 If you're the sort who appreciates overblown commentary aimed at meat-eaters, and preaching of man's innate sovereignty over his fate, you'll find Noah a delight. As my 2 out of 10 Star review suggests, I am clearly not one of them.",Noah
1232,barker-residence,Naff is an understatement,2,4 May 2014,"I had reasonable hopes for this film, the cast, the idea of saving species for the regeneration of the earth and the whole construction and survival of the ark.OK the acting was passable but the addition of so many aspects that had nothing to do with the original story was just laughable. This was closer to sci-fi but laboured under the pretext of a biblical story.It left me shaking my head at the ridiculousness of it all, even the scenes at the end were almost corny.The special effects were not that great especially the animals including many that I had no idea what they were supposed to be.Save your money, don't even rent it.

Wrong. So very wrong. I have NEVER walked out of a movie, i always find something to stay. But this this movie is the antithesis of what is wrong with movies. It was like Mel Gibson's 'Christ' had met an animating team and used the story of Noah. Its religious. it actually tries to convert you by illustrating 'man' as this disease while those of the 'lord' are better. If I had wanted a bible story, i would have bought a bible. I wanted to be entertained, but instead i may as well have been at home with a couple Jehovah's witnesses.

So you have good material here. the story of noah is a good one : god decided to kill everyone (shocker !) but still needed a guy to build a boat to save all the animals.so the director took this story and tried to make some sort of intelligent stuff with it but it fall flat. Trying to make something intelligent of a bible story it's like trying a making a healthy meal out of grease; you can try, it may taste good but it's not healthy. So with a bible story, you make a blockbuster and it will probably work, but if you try to do something meaningful, it will just be plain boring, like this movie.when i walked out of the theater, i said out loud : ""well, that was shitty !"" and the majority of the people agreed with me.",Noah
1235,tac-wow,"There once was a man named Noah who built an ark - right, what's an ark?",5,12 April 2014,"Giants and fallen angels walked on the earth and mated with women; men become evil; God sees the wickedness of men and decides to destroy all men except Noah and his family (his wife, three sons and their wives); God reveals his decision to Noah and ""tells"" him what to do: build an ark and God will save the animals; God makes a covenant with Noah; Noah completes the ark on the day the rain begins; it rains for 40 days and nights; any living thing outside the ark is destroyed (except presumably water creatures); the earth is covered in water for 150 days; the water recedes and the earth begins to dry out; Noah sends a raven and a dove to find land; the ark comes to rest, God tells Noah to leave the ark, build an altar and offer up a sacrifice, Noah makes a covenant with God, and life begins again with Noah taking care of the animals (essentially Genesis chap 6 - 9).That's all we really know about the story, as it pertains to the Bible anyway, anything else is at best conjecture and at worst rotten fiction. The Bible falls way short of describing what the area was like, what the people were like, esp Noah and his family, except that God ""found favor"" with them, what happened during those days of building of the ark (it was not built in a day) or what specific animals God actually saved (obviously not the unicorns or triceratops). No specifics, no dialogue (except God's) and no mention of special effects.As for the movie, loved some elements, especially the cgi cinematic elements surrounding the building of the ark and the flood itself. The personal story-lines between the characters were one man's vision and version, an art script if you will, but did not necessarily flow with the Biblical story, imo. As for the ""wicked men"" ... well they weren't wicked enough for me, just cruel, dirty, mouthy, meat eaters. And the ending, well, it was anti-climatic and too modern for my taste - oh dare I say it: too Hollywood.I did like how the film tied all living things together, animals and man, into the new covenant, even though in the movie Noah went to some interesting extremes. That link between man and nature is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, e.g., Is 35, where God heals nature as well as man, and in Rom 8, where all creation ""groans in labor pains awaiting the salvation of God"".Lastly, the movie was not a slasher, very little gore, no sex and no swearing. It was visually appealing, the acting was average (Mr Crowe actually did very well I thought) and the music was awesome as it played to the scenes while not overwhelming them. So if you want a decent story without worrying about how accurate or faithful it is to the Biblical account go see it for it is worthy of a big screen. If you are just too hung up on accuracy, dogma and strict Biblical interpretation, stay home and read Genesis Chap 6 over and over.",Noah
1236,chardaway88,Beautiful Story of a Man's Walk of Faith plus there's ACTION!!!,10,12 April 2014,"This movie got heavily criticized especially by Christians because of the biblical ""inaccuracies"". To tell you the truth this is one of the best stories out of Hollywood that describes an everyday person who is trying to interpret the voice and will of God who does good and hears well but sometimes makes mistakes along the way. It's not easy walking by faith. And this movie shows the struggles and uncertainties of every believer not just a super bible hero who people find it hard to relate to. They mix in several bible stories and concepts together but I believe, for those who ""listen"", the principle of how God reveals His Mercy, Love, and Righteousness while also giving us permission/dominion to choose to do the same or not is shown. Russell Crow is fantastic and the Herminie girl did great too, giving an awesome quote at the END. Please don't overly criticize one of the few movies that invest the promotion of Gods name by pointing to a character and story in the same bible where Jesus Christ the Bread of a Life can be found. Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice. (Philippians 1:15-18 NKJV)",Noah
1237,interstellar-post,This Movie Sucked Big Furry Balls,1,12 April 2014,"This is one of the all-time worst big-budget films ever made. ""Worst"" may even be a weak adjective where this movie is concerned. Never-mind that is strays so far from the book it's based on that there's very little to compare it to. They got the names right and there's an Ark in it. The similarity ends there. When the rock people showed up, with their crappy CGI animation that looked more like clay animation (maybe it was...), I nearly walked out. I spent most of this film glancing at my watch, wondering why no one else had left the theater, why I was still there too, then telling myself it would get better, and watching it get worse. There's this lame plot with Noah's sons and how Noah thinks he's only meant to save the animals and then they're all just gonna grow old and die after, so his boys aren't getting any snatch and Ham is upset because he wants a piece of ass for the boat-ride. They all had wives in the bible. Then there's the impossible pregnancy made possible by grandpa Methuselah, the damned wizard hermit fertility expert on the mountain-top. Yeah... OK. And so Noah becomes a psycho baby-killer wanna-be when he's through fighting off legions of bad guys Gladiator-style with the help of his clay animation friends that no one's ever freaking heard of. At no point did I want any of these ass- clowns to be saved. This movie is one big steaming pile of crap.

In addition to the miss representation of historical events.( spoilers alert: There were strange rocks creatures inspired by the authors WTF)!. Costumes were badly designed and it didn't represent an era that happened 3000 BC. The film was too long with a Hollywood ending! Moreover, they represent the prophet as a man who didn't understand what God wants from him, a man who kills with cold blood, drinks and even get totally naked!.

It is way deep in BC, and they were wearing clothing from the Middle Age: jackets, pants and boots. These flaws are not big enough to ruin the whole movie, but it is easy to get them straight if the director was a perfectionist like other good directors.I'm not Christian, so I don't care whether they are faithful to the bible story or not, since I believe the bible also might have had some facts omitted or exaggerated. I was expecting to see good imagination that could've made this short story exciting and realistic. They went all the way opposite, dull and stupid. Noah already had three sons who were married according to the Bible. God had plans. He made sure that Noah's family multiply without any problem after the flood. I don't understand why they scratched that and created a long, uninteresting conflict, which leads to an idea of incest.To me, it was a waste of time.",Noah

I don't understand how this movie has 6.6 IMDb stars it deserves 1.. That too for the useless effort the actors put in. Shame on them. Besides that I would also say shame on the directors. The movie lacked direction. They should hav used other names and steered clear of the religious references and made it into a fantasy movie. The fact that they used religious names and themes is downright blasphemous. Of course this movie is a flop how can it be a success when it is the worst movie in the world ?

Some people obviously can't live in a modern and open minded world. It had a lot of action and I liked the dynamic between the family members. Noah's struggle between doing what he believed his Creator wanted and what he himself wanted was truly gripping and raw. The story was magical and yet very true to human emotion and the beauty of life on our planet. There is no need to assume that this movie is actually a retelling of a biblical story, it should be accepted by religious critics as a story BASED on another story, as many films are.",Noah
1242,computermensch,A great work and artistic painting in living color on the theme of Sin titled Noa. Great dynamics - a practical demonstration of how to explain the problem with Sin.,10,13 April 2014,"A GREAT WORK ON THE THEME OF ""SIN"" TITLED NOA.The movie - an artistic painting of living color ... is titled Noa and the theme is SIN.If you happen to work with NE (N e w E v a n g e l i z a t i o n) inside the church lay community ... this movie is going to make much sense. It's a very insightful piece of work and in my mind one to be state-of-the-art example on how to present the dynamics of faith to people visually. It's very clear cut - and free from stuff where you could may be misunderstand that human-like behavior is OK and thus sin is OK (i.e. pointing to ... we need to change).To see this you will have to be schooled well on the themes and perhaps you already worked in your local parish with an interest in evangelizing.Like a painting, only painted in living color and images, this movie not just put the light on - but more or less radiates this image visually to the eyes and ears ... that sin has to be exterminated, disturbs community and Peace - and that the road to heavens does not include sin (thus human-like behavior). As a platform for this message the movie has chosen Noa - a time of extermination of sin ... and then pointing as in the gospel to the second chance replacing human-like (sinfull) behavior replaced by a message of Gods love.This piece of art greatly covers themes as family life as opposed to individual, single life - and community between beings - rather than living in the center of your own life taking advantage of others, wanting to make your own decisions - instead of putting of God and the community with others at the center in a message of love ... even being open towards not making your own decisions but being open towards thanking God and seeing others and yourself through his eyes rather than your. I.e. living close with God and others. This opening is what you may research through prayer.One body ...It's close to a master piece of art on sin - one of the problems we all have a hard time accepting today. So an important piece of work.Also a good example of how to treat the subject of Gods provision (Gods activity in the World) ... today many of us ... even Christians, live a single life ... and insist on making their own decisions. The movie also tries to treat that subject.It's an even better example of how to treat evangelizing in an inter-cross section between Jews, Muslims and Christians referencing the problem of sin. Also for anybody fond of human-like behavior (who does not see the problem).It's also a reminder of dooms day (NG) ... i.e. the flooding seconded by a new chance.In NE we sometimes try to work with dynamics, meaning putting practical examples - like theater - instead of just doing reading. Anyway does this go to the heart. Even readings may not go from the mind to the heart. Only an open heart will help.Anyway ... a great work on the theme of Sin titled Noa.Great dynamics - a practical demonstration of how to explain the problem with sin. More movies like this should be made. Movies more interested in carrying a practical and clear cut message rather than doing citations and not trying to convert people away from sin.

Suspension of belief to its extreme! A waste of time and money! That's as far as the story evaluation goes, which is the most important!

It is a far left environmentalist fantasy version of the biblical story. I'm not talking about a little Hollywood license here. This is just an entirely different story only loosely related to the biblical one. The biblical story is used only as a framework for the screenwriter and director to create a leftist environmentalist propaganda film. The world is dry, dusty and desertified; deforested and largely barren. Where once Noah, his children and his grandfather gathered berries, now they are reduced to foraging for lichens. His visions tell him not only of the deluge but that all mankind is wicked and must die including his own family. Even his own sons are wicked. They are ""filled with desire"" and ""covetous"" (aquisitive in modern progressive parlance). All of mankind must be wiped out in order to save the ""innocents"" - the animals - even if it means Noah has to resort to infanticide to ensure that even his own line ends.

1245,hannah_mutz26,Good movie! But it can wait until DVD,7,13 April 2014,"It's official There is no character Russell Crowe can't play.Noah pleasantly surprised me. I've never been a fan of biblical movies, but there wasn't many biblical aspects about it. Darren Aronofsky did a good job of turning this well known story about a man of God on a mission into an epic tale. Granted, any anti- creationist would probably hate this film because it does shine light on it. The addition of war, and unbelievable special effects turned this story from typical to wow.Like I said before, Russell Crowe as ""Noah"" was a fabulous choice. He nailed this ""holier than thou"" persona that he really needed in order to play a biblical character. He stole the show to say the least. As for the casting, I question some of their choices. As much as I adore Emma Watson, her character ""Ila"" really didn't have much impact in the movie. I don't see Emma Watson as a supporting role kind of actress, which is why I think she was almost too much for such a small role. On the other hand, Jennifer Connelly as Noah's wife, was an extreme disappointment. I am personally not a fan of Connelly's acting skills, so seeing her have such a huge role in this movie made it easier for Russell Crowe to be the center of attention. The movie itself was enjoyable to watch. It offered a little bit of everything to appeal to a variety of movie viewers. There was drama, violence, romance and heroism all in one film, which can be difficult to do. All in all, there is one important question that most expect to gain insight on when reading a movie review. Is Noah a must see? Ehh. I enjoyed my accidental viewing of the movie (I had planned on seeing Sabotoage), I would say wait until DVD. As good of a movie as it was, it is not one I would say needs to be seen ASAP.

According to the bible, all three sons had wives. Where did the idea of the stowaway come from?The central character of Noah has also been made unbelievable, as he comes across as a schizophrenic.

I see it as a propaganda movie made to distort the truth by the liberal Hollywood masses. Some truth does manage to seep through the the distortion such as we are all sinners & have freedom of choice. the story of the Bible from start to finish is about Jesus. Taking this in mind the stories become more apparent & easier to understand why God did certain things. Jesus was predestined to come at a certain time. And Jesus linage can be traced back to Adam & to let this linage be disrupted by the wickedness that was about to take the world over & to completely destroy the linage of Jesus, this could not be allowed to happen. But there are many other reasons for this story also. So, if you wish to examine the true story yourself, get a hold of a Bible yourself & read it with an open mind. It is your choice what to believe. Believe the lies or believe the truth. It is your freedom choice. God does not punish as Noah & the other people were doing it was them that was doing the punishment and as Noah did do in this version in the end was to choose love over punishment then Noah realized the true purpose God had in mind for him.",Noah

1250,mitnoy,"Noah Missed The Boat, But The Ark Still Floats",5,17 April 2014,"As a Catholic teacher who will teach in America's most remote corner, people ask me about my review of ""Noah"". ""Noah"", 2014, is a mixed bag but redeeming.""Noah"", starring Russell Crowe, Anthony Hopkins, et. al is NOT Biblically accurate. I offer the following criticisms in order of escalating importance:1.) The events of the 2nd & 4th day of creation are a bit confused. 2.) Some of the characters' names & Biblical references seem from differing eras of The Bible. 3.) Noah's father was not killed when he was a teenager. 4.) There are a few traditions invented for the movie; not in The Bible. 5.) The sending of the doves is not well portrayed. 6.) There were no guardian angels helping Noah. 7.) The movie's main villain is a basically made up. 8.) There were no stowaways on the ark & the ending of ""Noah"" (which I won't spoil) didn't happen. 9.) All of the character's wives seem inaccurately portrayed. Noah's son, Ham, had a wife who was on the ark and Noah's son, Shem, had a wife who gave birth to an unspecified number of boys; NOT girls. 10.) Noah didn't have to contemplate certain family decisions as Shem's wife actually gave birth to boys. 11.) ""Noah"", 2014, does not explore whether Ham sodomized his father in his nakedness. (Genesis 9:22-27.) This is disappointing as society is probably ready to have that discussion; albeit with controversy.And there are more Biblical criticisms. (I don't want to spoil the film.) So, the ""Noah"" of 2014 is simply inspired from the original story. This has sent many Christians & history buffs on red alert. However, without spoiling the movie, as a Christian I would say ""Noah"" does have many redeeming features.Specifically, ""Noah"" has sparked many teenagers into wanting to read the actual text. While the storyline of ""Noah"" seems like blasphemy to some, it seems more like Noah 2.0 to others. It could best be viewed as a reboot of one of the greatest stories ever told.In defense of ""Noah"", the actual story is only four chapters in The Holy Bible. All screen adaptations will take a few liberties. It is a common misperception that mankind tries to storm the ark en masse upon the coming of The Great Flood. This liberty seems acceptable to me because it embodies the story itself and articulates why God extinguished ancient man from the Earth.Other strengths of ""Noah"" are excellent special effects touches as to separate Noah's ancient world from our own. The unique illumination of the ancient sky was a tasteful touch. The angels heading to heaven, while not in the true story, was a tasteful effect than can be better applied in a more accurate future movie. Many other special effects were a nice touch; as usual these days.Additionally, ""Noah"", 2014, does an excellent job of illustrating the wickedness of ancient man as only modern cinematographer can do. This is very much in keeping Chapter 6 of The Book of Genesis.In the end I offer only one criticism of ""Noah"", as directed by Darren Aronofsky. The movie is adapted from what many of us Christians consider to be a true story. It is, however, wildly inaccurate in terms of historical accuracy.""Noah"", 2014, should contain a disclaimer at the start or end of the movie explaining that it is an artistic rendition and not fully accurate. It should attach to that disclaimer that if audiences enjoy the movie they should read the story in 5:32-10:1 of The Book of Genesis. Would ""Noah"" have done that I would offer little criticism.In the end I cannot teach people The Word of God from ""Noah"" as depicted in the 2014 adaptation. However, the strength of ""Noah"", 2014, is that it is turning young people on to read the story.I have heard many teenagers, especially boys, say that it was such a powerful movie that they want to read the story. Nowadays, whatever it is that brings young people back to Church is a blessing. I'll take it.As for the future, Hollywood directors would be well served to either stick to the scripture or post a disclaimer when they choose to depart from the scripture. 2014 is open season on Christians and one is left to wonder if Aronofsky would have dared such a scriptural departure if he were filming an Islamic story. The liberties taken with ""Noah"" would, in fact, have caused rioting in the streets if this were a major story from Islam. Hollywood needs to be sensitive to that fact. Aronofsky could be condemned for his sinfully inaccurate reboot of Noah's life & times but, ironically, through this artistic sin a generation of largely secular youth have been awakened to God & His glory.""Noah"", 2014, by Aronofsky falls short of God's graces. (and many critics.) ""Noah"" does miss the boat but, in the end, let he who is without sin cast the first stone. As for buying a ticket, be fruitful and multiply. See the movie.",Noah

He nailed this movie on the head when he said, ""horse hockey"".I suppose their next movie could be about John F. Kennedy. He will be married to a donkey and be having an affair with Ethel Merman.

Except for the CGI babies of course, weird. I was actually ready to walk out of this movie with more than a half hour left. Very disappointed with the direction they chose for this story. This had very little to do with the story of Noah's ark and dragged out every cliché of modern sci-fi or action adventures: The blah, blah speech before the battle (that has become way so over done) and the cgi creatures that remind me more of Treebeard than anything the bible would create.

Russell Crowe plays Noah as a tormented action hero with a slavish devotion to the Creator. This is also an extremely satisfying action movie... man vs man, man vs nature as well as man as the natural world's savior. There's still a lot of Old Testament here and some of the best bits are in the details.

""Noah"" uses the biblical tale as a jumping off point that relates to present day society and raises a lot of thought provoking question, while entertaining us with some amazing CGI effects. Russell Crowe's Noah believes the Creator wanted his family to save the animals - innocent creatures who have been ill-used by mankind. The same human race who have destroyed much of the natural world, harvesting without replanting and generally treating Creation as their own personal property and playground. Sound familiar to stories from our own nightly news? The family dynamics are well played by all and the special effects don't disappoint. I loved it.",Noah
1259,rad_mat,A complete flop.The idea was there but poor execution.,2,20 April 2014,"*SPOILERS*I have never wrote a film review before so sorry if this doesn't read like one. I don't mind the whole story idea and I find the elaborations on the original story where fine. However in my opinion the movie fell down on several different areas. This may be an error on my behalf but I was roped into watching the movie at the last second so I had only seen the trailer once. From the trailer I gathered that moat of the movie was going to be one big battle where powers where used that where imbued by god upon Noah. (This was gathered from the clip where the sword is stabbed into the ground and fire rose up in a cone in front of the character.) But in reality this was an insignificant few second long clip taken from a prologue completely unrelated to the defense of the ark combined with clips from the fight scene where the watchers and Noah where defending the arc which give me and everyone I have spoken to the wrong hopes and conceptions of what the movie was actually going to be.The acting was sub-par. Jennifer Connolly's portrayal of Naameh wasn't up to scratch. During the scene where she is pleading with Noah to save the children life she didn't sell the felling that she was meant to be showing. That scene in particular was laughable, it didn't make me feel the distress and anger that she was meant to be feeling. I watched the film with my mother and even she giggled when Naameh started shouting at Noah. The acting from Ray Winstone wasn't to bad but the accent he was trying to use was simply aggravating. The fact that he had a cockney accent but over pronounced the ""t"" at every opportunity makes the whole character seem like he is trying to be something he is not. Overall that bugged me all the way though the movie. Logan Lerman's portrayal of Ham wasn't bad up until the fight scene where Tubal-Cain is trying to stab Noah on the ark. The faces he was pulling simply let him down. It was a combination of looking surprised, curious, confused and yet for some reason happy that should have fit the scene but didn't.The CGI used in the film was actually pretty good. However the place that it fell short was the ""watchers"". The angles that have been exiled from the earth in my opinion should have been designed completely different. Sure, the basic idea was there, but they looked to friendly even though they are stone creatures. The extra arms that they had made them look just too comical. I don't know what animation process was used but to me, it looked like stop motion. The jerky, choppy motion of the characters was absolutely horrible. The motion that they moved with and the choppiness simply didn't fit with the rest of the CGI.Also during the prologue it showed scenes which looked relatively realistic and then for some reason it would cut to a silhouette version of the characters in front of a sun set walking horizontally. This didn't fit the movie at all. It seem like something that would be in a cheesy kids cartoon therefore ultimately ruining the mood set by the voice over.To sum up, them movie idea was there but it if I was the director I would of done almost everything different.",Noah
1260,webname1967,The human heart is the problem,9,21 April 2014,"What i liked about the movie is: - Noah acknowledgement of the corruptness of human nature. Even his own evil heart. You see a scene where he sees himself as corrupt being. - His faithfulness to the Creator despite his family understanding. What is interesting about this movie is the connection with Genesis 1 until Genesis 4. People call this movie anti-human why? Because the truth is shown that the heart of men is corrupt? This truth is shown also in the Bible. The only thing you can argue is the freedom they took in the film. And the fact that the whatchers are fallen angels that were punished because they wanted to help human kind. In this movie there 7 people in the ark and not 8. And not all sons of noah have a wife.This movies proves what is written in: Jeremia 17: 9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it? The solution is a new heart by the Holy Ghost.",Noah

One person said he was VERY angry that the word ""God"" was replaced with ""Creator"" and for him it ""had to be"" downhill from there. A lot of the negative reviews here and elsewhere seem to be coming from the same mindset. Obviously this review is not for these people. Either they won't read it or if they do they won't like it. But for the rest of you, those with open curious minds in search of a film worth spending money on, this is a very good movie. Russell Crowe leads an excellent cast through a script respectful of the Creator and his Creation, especially the innocent, the animals.

1263,trod88,Was better than expected,7,24 April 2014,"I feel Noah was a really good movie. If you go in there thinking is going to be like the bible you will be severely disappointed, but that goes for every movie based on a book. If you put the biblical story of Noah in the back of your mind and just watch you'll actually enjoy the movie. It had a good story line. There little things added like a love connection between Shem and another character. It was very dramatic at times. It portrays Noah as a mad man, which if you really think about, it Noah would have to be a mad man to do all the things god has told him to do. It portrayed this story very violently but I think thats what I liked the most about it. It adds a since of realism to the bibles simplistic story. You actually come to realize and visualize the destruction of mankind and are suddenly no longer desensitized to killing of millions of people. I think Noah borough a humanistic type of view to it. The Movie itself was very put together. YOu can see the affects of a big budget. I felt the cinematography was the best feature of this film. My one complaint is that the CGI almost looked cartoon like. If you're gonna make a movie with CGI at least put a little more effort to make it look realistic. I really enjoyed this film and thought that it kept pulling me in. If you go in expecting it to be like the bible you'll be disappointed but if you want to watch a good action packed and well put together move, then go see this movie but remove the images an pretense you have from the story of Noah in the bible. This is an entirely new way to portray this story and I think it did very well at it.",Noah

It is truly the philosophy of man mingled with scripture. This movie is offensive to all religions that believe or follow the old testament and it's derivatives. I don't like it an feel it is offensive. It feels like someone is telling me how the bible should have been written from a non religious and idealistic point of view. Key Points of Fallacy from this film 1. Only vegans\vegetarians are good people. 2. Rock transformers protected the ark. 3. All humans are evil and should be destroyed from off the earth. 4.

An Ark by the way with its own little raft launching area at the back like a modern day super yacht! Hey, don't let the truth get in the way of a good story right---noooooaaaaahhhhhhh!!! This is a fantasy film with very little of a Biblical nature to redeem it, apart from the Ark in the midst of the deluge which I thought was very realistic. No standout acting performances either from the cast--- A morose depiction of Noah by Russell Crowe---- although I did find Tubal-Cain ( Ray Winstone) unintentionally funny and watchable. All in all I'd say could have been so much much better if they had stuck to the original script in the Bible---but unfortunately Mr Abfronsky decided it needed seriously spicing up to get people to see it at all.------- typical atheist!

I was shocked, but after talking to other people, they said Noah was a great movie, if you can get past how unbiblical it is. So, I went and watched it, and loved it.

1268,fernando_o_monstro,The movie most true to the Bible,10,30 April 2014,"This is best movie that Darren Aronosfky made together with Black Swan. Most people normally who believe D&D is satanic (is not) say bad things about the movie without actually seeing him. Why? Because Noah and God are f***ing psychos who think humanity are evil because they eat meat. I love the movie. Russell Crowe was excellent as Noah. The parts who were the best of the movie: because God and Noah take away the chattel from the descents of Cain, they starve to death and are resorted to EAT the corpses of people who died (and babies...). Noah let humanity be all killed by God because well they are evil. But is impossible everyone in Ur and Caannan be evil, the men, women AND children. The Wathers are from Bible, just not the evangelical one. Darren takes inspiration from Genesis, Torah, Talmud, Kabbala, Book of Enoch and Coran.The Wathers are ANGELS who teach descents of Adam, Eve and Lilith to make weapons, cosmetics, arts, astrology and exploit the soil of precious stones and metals. And make love with human women creating hybrids of angel/ or demon and human blood, the nephilim (evangelicals call then ""giants""), because of this the Watchers are banished from Heaven and because of that they are called fallen angels, demons. And nephilim eat people by the way. So Noah is the most true to bible, except the relationships between Noah and his sons and trying to kill his granddaughter. Watchers are demons, of course they are not human. They do not look like Transformers at all! Thats is just stupid. Red with horns is better? -.-' Crowe, Emma Watson, Connelly and Hopkins are amazing, especially Russell as Noah. And God is genocidal, vengeful just like the Old Testament. God loves?

The only thing true in this movie is the characters names, there was an ark, it had animals in it and it was made of wood.

I feel that the film was different from the scriptures, both context wise and chronologically. Although the effects were ""cool"", I don't think the adaptation of the Bible was successful.There was multiple answers, and multiple errors of biblical truth. The movie has rock angels helping Noah build the arc(complete fantasy). Or we could talk about how in the Bible, the world was created by God in 6 days, but in the movie, it was created by a ""Big Bang"" and evolution of animals. That leaves the viewer wondering well what did The Creator actually do then? Many movies change the writings on books, but for crying out loud this is ""book"" is the holy scripture for many Christians. I wouldn't call it blasphemy per say, but I do think that there were a lot of false facts and unnecessary footage. For people currently learning or studying Christianity, I don't think that this movie would be accurate to learn, but rather read the First books in the the Bible. I thought this movie was going to teach society of their wrong doings and tell us that God is there and loves and forgives, however we are to never blah blah blah.

I think Hollywood's think-tank should be ashamed for producing such utter nonsense for the public. This movie is simply pollution and is stemmed from the atheist community. I believe that even Charles Darwin would be offended by this movie simply because of the premise.",Noah
1281,mario2405,"This movie, really...",1,7 July 2014,"I've never reviewed a movie before, but this time I felt a compulsion to do so. While watching it I kept asking myself: who gave this people the money to make such an awful movie? The eternal cliché of the good against the bad (the core of the movie) is truly embarrassing. The use of computer graphics to save a non-existent script only made matter worse. Actors tried desperately to make up the non-existent dialog without succeeding. Costumes, makeup, music... it was all wrong. What a failure. To the producers: Please accept a hint, next time give the money to charity, it will be much better spent. To the director: consider a different career (and do not try to emulate Peter Jackson, you can't do it). Do not go to see this movie, that's my suggestion.",Noah
1282,alexandriaelizabethlee,Incredible.,10,7 July 2014,"**** First time reviewer, please bare that in mind!!!!!! Forget the usual flood story, forget religion. This show, as a fictional film is amazing. I myself am not religious in any way, shape or form. If you see this film merely as a ficional story then it truly is an amazing show.. It is quite brutal and horrific in some scenes and for someone as empathetic as myself it can be a little overwhelming. I certainly have enjoyed the film.. Although running out of the room screaming at certain times was not that enjoyable.. I would genuinely recommend this film to those who have a passion for fantasy films. The quality of it, the incredible attention to detail and meticulous acting really makes it a quality lifetime favourite. Thoroughly enjoyed :)",Noah

I have no idea why people are crying and complaining that it's not like the Bible. It was epic, and really dark and gritty. It faced head on the fact that God KILLED everyone, men, women, children, the innocent along with the wicked. It's not like the nice story we learn in Sunday School with Noah as a sweet old man leading the happy animals to the boat. It is INTENSE. It drained me dry emotionally watching this, and once they were actually in the ark was the best part of the movie. It's just so much raw anguish; I was crying and I know the other women in the theater next to me were too when Ila (Emma Watson) is pleading with Noah up on the roof of the ark... oh my god....I really liked it a lot, and THIS is one of the things kids should see, instead of being brainwashed like I was about all the nice stories in the Old Testament.",Noah
1284,ivar-21,Worst movie ever,1,18 May 2015,"Worst film ever. Everyone contributing should be punished! I was willing to watch this as a catastrophe movie with heavy sound on a biblical theme, but it fails on all planes. I can't understand why an excellent director and high profile actors engage in such a bad screenplay. They should all be punished, and that goes for Patty Smith as well for making part of the soundtrack - sorry! Reasons why it fails: 1. Thin theme - the bible covers this theme in just a few passages. 2. Poor fantasy - since the theme in the bible is so thin, the screen writer as tried his best to fill the holes - and failed miserably. 3. It's just boring - for more than 2 hours!",Noah
1285,missingkitsune,This is more of a post-apocalypitic biblical AU fanfiction than sticking closely to the actual bible story,8,18 December 2014,"I found this to be an enjoyable movie. I mostly avoid any kind of religious propaganda so I'm not even sure why I chose to watch this movie, call it a curious whim. The acting was what you'd expect from the ""big screen names"" that are in it. The scenery was well plotted and visualized. As I said I enjoyed this movie very much. What did bother me so much was the way Noah was portrayed. Almost like an ax wielding psychopathic killer; hell bent on having things go his way and only his way with no thought for others. Contrary to the biblical story. It varies also that Noah's sons did not have wives while in the bible story it's clearly stated that they had wives. It's not a deterrent from the film though, it adds a bit to the psychosis. The fallen angels were an interesting additive to the film. Those from Cain's line were indeed the wholesale bad guys of the film as to be expected from the fallen son. My personal nit-pick with this film was during the angel's telling of the origins of earth and man instead of sticking to creationism as would be in the bible they threw in glimpses of ""the big bang theory"" (not the TV show) and ""the theory of evolution"" instead of creatures created as they were meant to be. Hence why I call it a post-apocalyptic biblical AU fanfiction. The clothing were wrong for that time line and having mechanized creations would have been way beyond their technology of the time. I do like how they simply called god ""the creator"". I found that much more fitting. I enjoyed it for it's simple entertainment and the effects put forth, as for sticking to. Even the part where Noah got drunk and was found naked by his sons. a vague reference in the bible it did a semi-passable job. Not accurate but not too far out of context either.",Noah
1286,gkalerwoot,BEWARE: This movie has nothing to do with the Bible.,1,5 July 2014,"BEWARE: 99% of movie has nothing to do with God, the Bible, and the biblical account of Noah. It is another lie. After watching it, I discarded it permanently. Whoever wrote the Noah script almost completely ignored the Bible account of Noah as if he could replace the Hebrew Testaments penned by Moses in c.1500BCHere is where the movie goes off in a non-biblical direction:1. Noah is depicted as tyrannical rather than righteous as the Bible clearly describes him. Noah even kills a few people. 2. Angels are portrayed as rock monsters (Golems really). 3. The Nephilim - Sons of God - Heroes of Old are not even mentioned (Genesis 6) when this would have served as a better intro in any Noah movie and the Bible already accounts for it. 4. Instead, this movie focused on a tale (a non-biblical story) based on Cain's descendants. 5. God isn't even mentioned except as ""The Creator"", when the Bible clearly shows God talking to Noah and is the one who shut him inside the Ark (Genesis 7). 6. The Bible clearly shows 8 people went into the Ark (Noah+wife, 3 Sons and their wives). This movie is missing at least 2 wives. 7. Instead, the movie gave us 2 baby girls born in the Ark. 8. The movie gives too much screen time to Emma Watson (wife of Noah's son Shem), when the Bible mentions practically nothing about any of the wives of Noah's children. 9. The THEORY of Evolution is depicted, when the Bible clearly does not support evolution, as the animals were also formed like man - from dust of the ground (Genesis 2).What is accurate: The animals came to Noah (Genesis 7), since most atheists think Noah gathered the animals (clearly they didn't even read Genesis 7). Rain fell and water did burst from the ground (Genesis 7).If you want to learn about Noah, read it in the Bible and see what Christ said about Noah in Matthew 24 (see verses 36-39) when he compared the Noah account to the Second Coming.",Noah

I know my bible, and I know the TRUE story of Noah and this is not it. A lot of Christians may consider this film blasphemy, and maybe this is true. But myself find it amusing as everyone has a different interpretation of what they feel the bible is. The ONLY reason I gave this a 6 was because the movie itself was a decent story and has some decent special effects. THATS THE ONLY REASON. But again this is NOT the real story about Noah. I wish film makers would quit trying to get rich and trying to make the atheists happy. If your going to make a movie about the bible, Please try to be correct. If you are looking for movies that come close to what the Bible says, Try Jesus of Nazereth, The GReatest Story Ever Told, and The Ten Commandments. Those movies were created when faith was worth more then money. When your belief and value was based on the good book. Not what you felt it was, and if you were worried if you offended people by it. Thank You.",Noah
1289,sounds-emid,Watch trailers only - trust me!,1,5 July 2014,"The movie is only good in trailers and I recommend watching trailers to save 2 precious hours of your life. Weak script, cheap acting, cheap special effects, no connection between some scenes transitions, oh my I can make a long list.The writer was confused throughout and was probably in dilemma between writing a historical or an epic apocalyptic story and in the end messed up between both. No character could develop connection with the viewer. I mean, I still cannot digest some scenes like e.g., how could the ark settle on the mountain when the water level was already at the normal sea level? How come the water started coming out from the earth when it was enough sea flood there? Even then the CG could have been made good to show it real but alas the Age of Empires version 1 graphics are still superior in quality than cartoonography in this movie. And there are lot of low quality stuff.Lastly, movie is probably getting the stars due to the presence of well known actors but it deserves only 3 to 4 stars if not less.",Noah
1290,fauredn,Flawed in every possible way,1,6 July 2014,"This movie was flawed in every possible way. It didn't work as a semi- historical movie based on a Biblical story because of the pile up of absurdities. To name a couple: the use of Watchers, rock creatures that symbolize fallen angels. Or the water coming from an earth-spanned storm that floods the entire earth in less than a couple of minutes. Furthermore Noah is fierce in battle and doesn't even think twice about murdering whomever stands in his way. Surely not the image one would have of a prophet. And why does the director choose to portray the creationist view that the world and the entire universe was created in seven days? The story in itself was drab, on the brink of childish. Plus, the writers forgot to think this through. With only three women of a different genetic pool in the Ark, one for each of the three sons of Noah, you'd have to consort to incestuous relationships after the third generation in order to repopulate the entire world. Is this the message the movie wants to give, that we are all the children of an incestuous cesspool? Even the special effects where not very convincing. All the animals seemed fake and identical in their movements and behavior. And what with the peace-dove at the end of the movie?! Can you get any cornier?! If this movie would have been made by the Roman Catholic Church with its archaic ideas and thoughts, you wouldn't see a difference. Congratulations Aronofsky for showing your true convictions!",Noah
1291,drhoads-46-853732,Just Like Satan - A Little Truth Mixed With a Lot of Lies!,1,6 July 2014,"This movie is not even close to the bible's account of Noah. It takes things mostly from a book called Enoch. The book of Enoch is not in the bible and was rejected as an inspired book of the bible. Right from the beginning they get it wrong when Noah is seen with his sons. Noah's sons were not even born when God told him that he would destroy the world with a flood. Shem is not Noah's oldest or first born son. The bible says Noah was 500 years old when he had Shem, Ham and Japheth. It also says Noah was 600 years old when the flood came. It later says Shem was 100 years old, 2 years after the flood. That would make Noah about 502 years old when Shem was born. Also, these were not little kids when the flood came. They were about 98-100 years old, at least grown men considering they lived to be about 900+ years old before the flood. Shem lived to be 600 years old after the flood. The ""Watchers"" who reminded me of the Ent trees from Lord of the Ring are a complete mockery of the bible. These are the so called, ""fallen angels."" They make Noah out to be a mad lunatic instead of what the bible says about him, a man of faith and a righteous man that God saved from the destruction of the flood. In short, this is nothing more than Hollywood's attempt to make the bible into a fantasy story. They would make more money on the movie if they tried to be accurate by the bible's account in my opinion.",Noah
1292,shray47,This movie was good. Exaggerates for the right reasons.,7,6 July 2014,"This movie is not as bad as people say it is. Why didn't they tell us exactly how they designed the ark and it's architecture? because it does not matter. And that's not the film's point. As the rock giants don't really matter, nor the effort put into the CGI effects ,and where the animals came from. Viewers expected either a boring completely realistic film, or better CGI? seriously that's what people complained for. Well.. the movie was good and people who did not like it in my opinion , did not get the point. Okay, i know what you'll say, that it was far from realistic and the creators left much details unexplained. But you miss the general idea, the point that this film was trying to make. The landscapes are utterly barren someone said. I agree, but that was to exaggerate on how tough the things were, and that men have drained almost all of earth's resources . To showcase the brutality of men and why the flood had to happened in the first place. People watch fantasy - science fiction films and they love them, why? because they know not to expect complete reality from them in the first place, so they ignore that and try to get the message the film is trying to make, if any. So why categorize films like that, even if it was based of a bible story? The film was everything it had to be. Acting was Great, showing the frustration among Noah's family and how tough the Creator's task was, with all the obstacles that came with it.Okay there were some rock giants, some bad CGI, but that was not the point! Who cares exactly how the ark was build? if it was round or square? If the animals came from nowhere and that little ""magic"" touches they gave the film. Not the best thing yeah, but again, that was NOT the point. In my opinion the message of this film was clear and I cant understand why people didn't get it. OK, not the best of movies.

The director of this movie has only surprised me time and time again and I look forward to exploring more of his work.I'm not going to spoil too much about the story, but I believe it took a few elements from the 'original' story and improved upon them and enhanced them with modern morality. In a way it teaches us that our own morals and natural sense of right and wrong, our natural humanity, can be superior to blind faith and fanaticism. This is the only reason why the movie isn't scoring higher on IMDb right now, because religious nuts are on a campaign against this horrible movie that dares tell people that blind faith is nothing but insanity.I'd give this movie a 9/10 and would recommend anyone of sound mind to watch it.",Noah

I thought it only could be better but I was wrong again. This movie is full of religious bullshit, horrible acting, a really, REALLY BAD script and special effects looking they are from ten years ago, or maybe from a new low budget PC-game.

The storyline is nice, Hopkins, Emma Watson and Russel do their best day in the office with this movie most of the time, and it is generally very good acting. It is indeed unfair to critic the movie on the Christian perspective, and give it bad marks. It had represented maybe a different view, but probably not far from the true one on how things have occurred, and it probably imagined the things in a perspective of mankind, where it was all about man's choice if he wants to survive on earth or end humankind, where all God wanted to see was if they still have feelings and mercy.

This is not my idea, but i have heard it so many times, that can't even remember who said it :"" If you are thinking a script yourself, than make whatever comes to your mind, but if you are using a biblical theme, than at least try to follow the content "". I mean, i don't know what the writer was smoking, but now i want some, too. Another great aspect of this movie is that its boring as hell, so i went to sleep twice during the first 30 minutes.

So the Director did the best that they can do in this movie!!! PLUS it's called ""Noah"" because it was about the Prophet's story (sarcastic)!!! In my opinion there was gaps need to be filling, like for his prophesy intuition insight and dreams he had, it needed to be longer to convince the audience that he is one of God's prophets! Plus the animals! the director neglected all of the 500 kind of animals and showed us 3 kinds not even the instinct ones!!! he was suppose to make more time for them in the movie!!!!! Other than that, Noah had 4 sons (Sham,Ham,Japheth,Kan'an) not 3. The movie showed us actors that had nothing to do with what they really looked like, I mean Sham is the father of Asians in general, Ham was the father of Africans and Japheth was the father of Europeans. They all looked Americans, Irish and British. how come??!!! And what about his fourth son?? Where in God's name is he. If the writer took more time to look things up. The fourth son would've made the story much more interesting, because Kan'an was a traitor and a non believer to his father And his wife was a traitor, she used to snitch on her husband ""Noah"" to her tribe, and she used to make fun of him because of his ideas with building an arc in the middle of nowhere with no water.

If the world you knew were going to be destroyed, do you think you might pack a few books? Of course Hollywood can't be expected to get any Bible story right, but this was more horribly wrong than even I expected. It'd be laughable if it weren't so blasphemous.

A well directed film with a relatively strong cast that only really lacks a stronger script. At times the narrative is enjoyable and can occasionally be thought provoking but as a whole is probably the only thing that I felt let this film down... That and Ray Winstone. (And I'm English). Crowe is good, Emma Watson is better. The only other thing i want to touch on is the CGI. I personally didn't think it was bad or dated. Arinofsky has created a beautiful visual film as a whole. The 'watchers' don't look nice but I really don't think they are meant to. After all they are supposedly fallen angels that melted the earth and are now covered in soil and rock. He based the look on swans covered in oil.... (You'll understand when you see them) The arc looks fantastic and is meant to have been built 2000 years ago so anyone expecting a beautiful vessel will be disappointed. Finally the animals... We see bears, and goats, and monkeys that all look odd. That is because they aren't bears, or goats, or monkeys. They are meant to look similar but evolution may have altered them in the last 2000 or so years. Watch it with an open mind, you are bound to enjoy :)",Noah

I thought the writers did some interesting interpretations on many things, all points to make me want to go back and re-read through Genesis and the Old Testament in general to see how they could come to that possible interpretation. In an environmental ethics class once we had to read through parts of Genesis then have an open discussions on the direction and topic of 'dominion'; we were split there too.....I think the fundamental critical points of Biblical history and the reasons for the Flood are in the movie...I also found it fascinating that they shared Enoch's vision as well, maybe to ponder for our future final judgement? I think Christians should like this movie because it will inspire people to read the Bible in want to understand it better for themselves...but maybe I'm too optimistic for humanity? :D Again, I thought it was a Great Movie!!!

Although Enoch is one of the books of exclusion, it has more specific insight about the fall of the angels and the generations that proceeded after Seth and unto Noah, so incorporating those elements into the story adds a flair unknown to those whose stories are strictly biblical in origin.Noah is a good movie for those whose have studied the non-canonical books and the apocrypha, mostly because those people will have a better understanding of the content without resorting to fundamental prejudice. The visuals are beautiful, but they are not the sole focus of the story, which makes it a thrill to watch but also doesn't cheapen the feel by slamming the viewer with CGI overload - a welcome change in todays movie world. ((For an example, watching Red Dawn (Patrick Swayze) in the eighties was an engrossing experience, a tale woven from the character interactions and storyline as opposed to the recent incarnation of Red Dawn (Chris Hemsworth) which is so action-packed and full of effects that there is no real story to enjoy.)) Noah, on the contrary, is a story that uses effects to augment the storyline, instead of relying entirely on them to tell it. So lets review...The beginning world with it's imaginative interpretation of Pangea and the mining of an energy substance that powered a pre-historic industrial civilization is a wonder to behold, and Man (as the sons of Cain are called) looks appropriately barbarous with a taste of ""Mad Max"" thrown in for menace. Noah watches his father die at the hands of Man before he is able to be given the ""snakes shed"" (the artifact of Eden, passed down through Seths lineage from father to offspring for generations), and retreats into the wilderness, his view of mankind eternally wounded.The movie continues on into Noah as an adult, who now has three young sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth)and his wife, Na'ameh (Jennifer Connelly). They forage the earth for things given them by the ""Creator"", and they do not kill (presumably Noah has an aversion to eating meat and taking life, even from the Creators smallest creatures, and this is supported sparingly in some biblical interpretations; ""Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."" Genesis 9:3-4) On one of these foraging excursions Noah tells his son not to pick more then he can use, and that night he is given a vision of a great many people dying in a flood. He tells Na'ameh his vision and they decide to travel to the mountains where his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) lives for advice on his vision. On the journey to him they find a girl in an old mining camp (she later becomes Emma Watson), and also are chased by Man and captured by the ""Watchers"" (A band of fallen angels who have been cursed to suffer as stone beasts for defying the will of the Creator and ascending to earth to help the descendants of Cain.) One of these ""Watchers"" believes that Noah is sent by the creator and, at risk of exile, takes Noah and his family to the mountain and protects their camp. (As an aside, the ""Watchers"" in most stories were not as benevolent in their acts, instead they had been banished because they had lusted after the daughters of men and came to earth to be with them.) While visiting his grandfather, Noah is given another vision and a seed from the original garden of Eden to start growing the trees needed to build an ark in an otherwise barren wilderness. The other ""Watchers"" come to get their betrayer, but upon arriving see that Noah has planted the seed and a river goes forth into the land that will lead all the animals the world over to the place of the ark, and they soon change their minds to help.I'm not going to give away the rest of the movie here, but as the reader can tell, there are many elements which are borrowed from various other (mostly Judeo-Christian) texts and myths concerning Noah and the flood. All of them are articulately and beautifully interwoven to create a story that is entertaining and inspiring to those who wish to find out more.This is my first ever review and I'm terrible at it but don't let my crappy writing detract from watching the movie! It's grrrreat!",Noah
1310,dorca-67-211012,Noah and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,4,30 July 2014,"I should break this review into at least three parts: the good, the bad, and the reasons that you shouldn't watch this film. (Spoilers follow; duh) The biggest positive of the movie is the ark itself. Whether it was digitally rendered or actually built, it was the most realistic of the large structures in the film. Also Anthony Hopkins, but even he could not atone for the many sins committed by this movie.Now for some of the bad. I suppose Russell Crowe had a more antagonistic character in mind for Noah, and I'm not about to launch into a religious speech here, but (spoilers ahead) the scene in which he threatens to murder his granddaughters (end spoilers) was absolutely insulting, as it was not in the actual Bible, and made no sense at all. That was a pretty bold move on the director's part to blindly assume that God (oh excuse me, the creator) commanded Noah to do such a thing. That attempted raid on the ark was pretty weird too; apparently people were making corrugated metal sheets and rebar in Noah's time? Why was there a convenient side entrance to the ark for the villain? But I'm rambling about mere details......so I shall elaborate on the broad, more general reasons that you shouldn't watch this film. I know that I'm not the only one who grows quickly tired of the excessive use of computer graphics in film making. This movie utterly abused CGI even to the point of digitally rendering animals and human babies. This movie is almost entirely fake-looking (aside from the ark and a few other decent moments) and that alone ruined the viewing experience. Speaking of CGI, from which Transformers movie did the writers derive the fallen angels encrusted in rock? Also, glowing snakeskin. Terrible casting of Emma Watson and her ilk. Emma Watson failing miserably at pretending to cry / be in labor. Drunk, naked, shaggy Russell Crowe. Need I say more?I'm sure many of you thought that Anthony Hopkins is as old as Methuselah; if you happened to duck in just as he makes his first appearance, now you can make a joke about how he's literally Methuselah. That in itself bumped this movie up to 4/10 stars.",Noah
1311,elohist2009,...Fail...,1,31 July 2014,"When someone who doesn't believe in God makes a film, it can be determined what kind of theological standing he or she has, based on their work: There are people who think God doesn't exist, and people who don't want God to exist (to ""know"" would be presumptuous). This film was certainly directed by the latter. I know there are people who make a living polishing turds, but it is sad to see people trying to defend this movie. I will say this to the director's credit: he is probably the first to make a full-on atheist, Bible movie. It was grossly apparent that no attempt was made to consult any biblicists, or establish any religious collaboration in the writing of film, script or otherwise. While the image portrayed in trailers was one of great interest, even the notion of how the world would react to the all but too late knowledge of an ark built that could possibly save them from destruction, the Bible is very clear on the fact that no one knew or believed that the flood would come and simply lived their lives as normal, eating, drinking and marrying. Anyway, from giant rock creatures as ""fallen angels"" that never existed, to a brazen stowaway on the ark by someone who was never meant to survive, this movie got nothing right. We get it, Mr. Aronofsky, you don't believe in God; to you, the records of the Bible are a mere folk story, a brilliant work of fiction, which can be rendered to your will. In that case, be original and make your own ""great flood"" movie; the writer of the epic of Gilgamesh would have made a better story than this movie. You just used the name of a biblical figure to boost sales for an inevitably wretched film. Just because the Author is God, doesn't give you license to plagiarize, if that is what it could even be called.",Noah

1313,mdhallett35,Poorly Written,1,1 August 2014,"This movie while visually striking and the special effects are great. The story is another Hollywood corruption of bible. The story couldn't call God, God it is the creator, while siting references to the bible changed the whole story of a Man submitting to Gods will and to the salvation God gave his people in the form of a new beginning with Noah family. The whole no wives thing and the twin girls what a bunch of BS. If you don't want to tell the actual tale of Noah then call it something else and don't quote other peoples beliefs in your fantasy. How do you get your story line from this? And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. This movie isn't worth the plastic it is recorded on, I am disappointed in Russel Crowe, Anthony Hopkins, and Emma Watson I like them as Actors and feel that they should have looked at the content before signing on to further the corruption of the greatest story ever told. (The Bible).",Noah
1314,dedicatedchildofgod,:(,1,1 August 2014,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, and then I wished I had not seen it at all. It was absolutely the worst bible adaptation movie I have ever seen. I am sorry the meaning of Noah was not understood to the makers of this movie. Noah is about a mans righteousness, obedience and love of God, and a new beginning for mankind and the world. It is and expression of Gods love, mercy, devotion, faithfulness, beauty, forgiveness, his promises, and yes, his wrath. This movie turned this true account of history into the exact opposite, a terribly written fairy tale. ( if anyone wants to know the true account of Noah you can read Genesis chapters 6-9. )",Noah
1315,xEliteAnubisx,Theological problems,2,1 August 2014,"Wow, This was a poor attempt at turning a biblical story into a movie. Besides the poor CG, the lack of theological understanding and reasoning behind Noah's actions made this a very hard movie to watch.I feel that this movie would have been much more successful if they had kept the original details of the story of Noah(like the wife situation.)Also, they reference Adam and Eve... why is it that so many people can think that God is omniscient and yet they think that God somehow made a mistake with Adam and Eve? Don't you think that God knew what he was doing? This life was not a mistake but a time for us to learn, grow from our choices and experiences and prepare to return to Him. All throughout this movie Noah shows a great deal of confusion and lack of understanding to this purpose, making him seam (for a lack of a better word) un-prophet like. His attitude is hardly that of a humble servant of God. There were many things about this movie that I didn't like, and a few things that I did enjoy. Overall, Id'e say don't waste your time on this one.",Noah
1316,ddfishes100,Major disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,2 August 2014,"I came into this movie having seen reviews that were less than stellar, but I had no idea it would be the joke that it is. I understand that watching a biblically-based movie can drag, and that embellishment is necessary, but this was taken to an extreme. This was a cliché Hollywood script, with the bad guy surviving against insurmountable odds and ending up in an epic battle with the movie hero, the movie hero battling his inner demons,etc, etc... can you say ""Luke Skywalker?"" But Skywalker was fictitious, and Noah is supposed to be based on an historical figure. God chose Noah because he was a just and holy man, but at one point, we see a raving lunatic, and in another we see a budding alcoholic. In the second half of the movie, Noah becomes a monomaniacal fiend, bent on carrying out God's will, but coming across more as Jack Torrance in The Shining, slowly losing his mind......Heeeeeerrrrrrreeeeee's Noah!! Awkward scenes + antiquated special effects + a formula script = don't waste your time!",Noah
1317,dbunton9,This is BAD,1,2 August 2014,"I am watching this horrible movie right now, I have long since stopped paying attention. I am always interested in seeing different takes on stories. However, this is so silly and far flung from any sense that I find it best to just stop watching. I do know scripture well, and am use to seeing strange liberties taken with scriptural accounts--but with this you have to hunt and pay close attention to see even the slightest similarity to the Bible. This may not offend some people. If a bad Biblical account doesn't bother you then know this...............This is a horrible movie on any account. Watch at your on risk!",Noah

It could have had so much potential if it had been in line with what the Bible simply states in regards to Noah's days, the flood and thereafter. The watchman... demon-like characters that had no place in the film. Noah and his family built the ark by themselves with God's help. After seeing the watchmen helping, I turned it off, as I had had enough. I did not see the nephilim (the materialized (satanic)angels which were giants, but looked like man) before turning it off, so not sure if they were included in the film. I wish I had read more reviews before renting it on demand.",Noah

I don't even know where to begin on how terrible it was. I will say there is very little actual truth to the movie. If you actually read the bible you can see that very easily and quickly! Second, the whole point of the Noah story in history in general was missed in this movie so even if you took liberties they still missed the point. And finally, it should never have been called Noah if it is so awfully wrong from the true Noah in history! I really have no idea what they were going for if they didn't tell the story right, they didn't get the point of the story right, and the man was not like the real Noah in history. Have no clue what they wanted to do but I am so glad I only watched this because it was free at redbox. I would never tell anyone to pay to see this movie! You can get a much better story by reading it in the bible and that one is actually true! Research it!",Noah
1321,ruarebel2,Sharknado2 was better,1,5 August 2014,I cannot express how horrible this movie is. It's like JRR Tolkien rewrote the story of Noah and threw in some Rock Ents and then the screen play was written by the same guy that wrote the Road Warrior. It was horrendous. My Wife and I watched this and were completely baffled that it was tied to the story of Noah and then we watched Sharknado 2...which we enjoyed because it was so obviously tongue in cheek in it's comedy. Save your time. Don't watch this movie. It's two hours of your life that you will never get back. That is time that could better be spent doing something you will enjoy more. Like maybe getting a root canal or perhaps preparing for a colonoscopy. If I had it to do over I would choose elective surgery rather than sit through this film. At least then they would give me drugs to keep me comfortable.,Noah

I watched Noah out of sympathy for all of those hopes and efforts. I now know why Noah was so quickly available on DVD and have little sympathy left. The more I try to describe this film to anyone, the funnier and more absurd it seems. I realize the ""real"" time frame in which this movie supposedly takes place is never clear, I assumed from the ""In the beginning"" beginning, the location and costumes, etc., that it was ""pre-Jesus"" and according to Noah's story in the Bible. Allowing for the presence of ""rock men"" and suspending my belief for a reality-based film, I wonder if I am the only person (judging by all the reviews I have read so far) that had a major problem with hearing the cry ""Get the guns!"" Huh? I gave it a two rather than the lowest rating because I thought the serpent was worth one point.",Noah

I grew up reading the bible so I know how it didn't follow the story, but I feel like this adaptation shows just how fantastical the original story is. If you can believe in the original why not believe in transformer like fallen rock angels. Genius little jab at the Christian faith. I will admit that Russel did freak me out a little but I guess that is part of the genius, we would think anyone was crazy if they said they were touched by God as he was, so is it too far fetched that Noah went a little mad?

1324,pierre_fortin,From the point of view of a Christian,1,15 August 2014,okay so go ahead and give me bad reviews but it has to be said even on this website that from the point of view of a Christian this film is a sin. It was disgusting to watch and we even discussed it at Church as an abomination. First off Hollywood is known for its hypcorisy and making money from trash but this is a further step.. Noah is an angry man? Noah is going to kill babies? You know the answer is never. Okay some would say it is just a film but why not have Russel Crowe act in a good film? And as Christians Noah and his wife would never allow premarital sex or birth outside wedlock. So that was wrong as well and the director left it in the film,Noah

I've seen Hollywood take liberties before but this LITTLE resembles the Bible's account. This is crazy! The liberties taken defy credibility...the Biblical account has wives for the sons, but this film changes all of that. Noah being a madman with little regard for even his own family. Noah makes no attempt to save his own father. He wants to kill the offspring of his son. The Rock transformers...where does that come from? Instead of Noah following God's instructions, he appears to be a demented crazed person following his own thinking. Over and over again this film shocks you with it's deviance. From poorly written script that no actor can make something of, it makes you want to turn it off early on. You keep watching, hoping it'll get better...it doesn't. It gets worse by the minute until you are dumbfounded with it's atrocities.",Noah
1327,davidhvoss,Great movie. Still has me thinking about it days later.,8,22 August 2014,"I have a Master of Divinity and teach theology to 7th grade students. I have also served as a Parish Pastor. I am theologically conservative, so some may wonder why I like this movie so much. The movie certainly takes liberties with scripture and certainly should not be used as a teaching device for scripture, but that was not the intent of the director, obviously. It was obvious to me that the director used the Noah story to get people to think about good and evil in this world. We are left understanding that even those who claim to be 'good' also battle the evil within themselves. I loved the ""rock"" creatures because it was so unexpected and had me digging into my Bible to try to find out why he decided to add them. That is why I like this movie. Anytime a movie can force you to think and dig into scripture and ask tough questions, that's a good movie! I will use this with my students and we will talk about good vs. evil, how the movie reflected scripture, what it missed and in doing so, I will have engaged people in God's Word. I loved the filming of the movie. The animation was unique and more interesting than today's fluid and perfect animation found in the children's movies. I'm a big Russel Crowe fan but for the past 5 years I felt he was mailing it in. It was obvious he took this project very seriously and it was nice to see him back on his A game.

1328,bobraczynski,"Very entertaining, well done movie.",9,23 August 2014,"Wow. I could not believe the pages and pages of bad reviews for this movie. Then it occurred to me that people aren't reviewing the movie based on its entertainment merit, but instead, are rating it poorly because the movie offended them as it did not exactly align with their belief system. Folks, movies are primarily for the purpose of entertainment. This movie isn't intended to be an exact portrayal of the story in the Bible. It is intended to be an entertaining movie that happens to be based on a familiar story from the Bible, and to that goal, I say job well done. The acting by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and Anthony Hopkins is superb. The plot and setting is intriguing. There is character development, conflict, and the movie has an appealing style. So my advice is to recognize that the volumes of pages of 1 and 2 star reviews reflect not the true merit of the movie, but instead the desired portrayal of the movie by congregation leaders around the world. If you feel that the movie might offend you based on your faith, then don't see it. If you're looking to see a well-done, entertaining movie, then don't let the inaccurate reviews persuade you to miss it.",Noah

Somehow, somewhere out there in ancient times there was a drug so magical that it put thousands upon thousands of animals to sleep for at least 40 days and 40 nights (but the movie doesn't bother telling you this, I had to check it in Wiki-bible) and YET, the drug does not affect the human mammals putting forth this incense-like drug into the air one bit... oh, wait, perhaps it did - maybe that's why the actors, when not screaming like rejects of acting school, walked around saying their lines as if they were repeating something banal like the shopping list or the ratio of air they put in the car tyres...So, after the water subsides Crowe goes off and miraculously turns a grape vine into instant grog - maybe grapes came pre-fermented in biblical times, and after preaching on the evils of man like a repetitive psychologically impaired manic for two, yes two long hours, apparently gets utterly drunk on about 15 tankards of straight grape juice... wow. But seriously, about all 15 tankards of straight grape juice would have really given him was diarrhea, and which by this stage the movie was moving me closer and closer to as I gnashed my teeth and pulled out my hair praying on my knees that God was actually really watching so that she/he/it could send all the biblical plagues to the script writer, the producer, the director and the screaming housewife, for daring to rip off my hard earned cash and putting together a really great preview which conned me into watching this debacle.Unless you hate yourself, go and watch a REAL B grade movie.",Noah

I fully agree with the other reviews, and wish I had read them before bothering to watch the movie. How this is still listed as 6.1/10 is beyond me. Mansell's soundtrack was a washed up version from The Fountain without a degree of enthusiasm or passion, and wouldn't be suitable as elevator music in a motel 6. Aronofsky was obviously trying to hold a mirror up to ourselves and show us what we've created, but failed as miserably as has his movie. As for the duo's other movies, The Fountain 10 out of 10, Black Swan 9/10, Requiem for a Dream 8/10, Pi 8/10, The Wrestler 7/10, but this movie I would give a score lower than 1/10 if I could.

This piece of self-indulgent garbage is an insult . A movie with this theme, budget, and a cast of this calibre ( Crowe, Hopkins etc)had so much potential, so many opportunities. And look at what we got. One of the most absurd aspects are the ark-building rock monsters that look like some fusion of a low-budget Transformer and a Muppet. Their appearance at the start leaves one confused, to say the least, but the truth is these stupid creatures are one of the only engaging things in the movie. The storyline? Horrible. The acting?

1333,krazyboykeith,Partially Disappointed,6,7 September 2014,"I have to say that I was partially disappointed when I saw the movie, Noah. What I liked was that the story matched many theories about the flood that people have suggested, including the water coming put of the ground and not just rain. And many historians have shown that an ark was more likely built in the shape as it was shown in this movie, than the middle age interpretations that most of us recognize today as Noah's ark, which resembles middle age boat architecture. The part that made some sense to me was the portrayal of real human behavior. Put into the same situation, most humans would behave and be as barbaric as they (the wicked) were shown in this movie. Put into less of a situation, many humans still act that way. Anyone that has been at the opening of a Black Friday sale would know what I mean.I feel that the angel characters weakened the movie. While many reviewers were reminded of transformers, I was reminded of the the Rock Biter in the ""Never Ending Story"". They even sounded like the Rock Biter. The graphics were not as strong as most movies these days, but we got the point. So, if the angels were left out, I feel that the movie would had went a lot better.",Noah

'Noah'should have been a really great movie given today's advanced technology. I understand the concept of altering an idea to make it more entertaining. Even agree with it. But changing a story with solid structure into one with none at all baffles me.Mr. Aronofsky is too competent a writer/director to be held completely responsible for this mess. How about pointing a finger at the Industry brass, the stiff-necked cowards who sacrifice millions to spread their misguided agenda to the movie-going public (the element that dictated and green-lighted this train wreck).This movie had a budget of $125 million and made $359 million. Sure it made a profit but nowhere near the billion dollars it could have made if they had stayed closer to the original story. 'Noah' was either a bad business decision or malevolent propaganda.

I was very disappointed and feel I got ripped off. The makers could have taken the Biblical story and taken some liberty with it, but to have these stone angels called watchers, God wanting to kill off ALL humans, no wives for Noah's sons, Noah wanting to kill his grandchildren because God instructed him to, when they show the creation event they show it in an evolutionary form and etc. are so far removed from the Biblical account.

The visuals would be beautiful, but they don't add to the story. They just provide an odd background that seems as other worldly as the Ark, the flood, and the whole plot.

1337,anitakwleigh,Science FICTION,1,20 September 2014,"Sheesh, what do I say? Well, they got the names right; there was a Noah, Shem, Ham, Japheth, and a Tubal-Cain....there was even an Ark....sand a bunch of animals that came into it....oh, and yeah, there was a flood...they borrowed the names, an Ark and a flood from the Bible ~ then they made a science FICTION movie, and that is that. That is all I would have chosen to say, but since I am required to write a lengthier review, I could say this movie is a disgrace to the biblical version of events! Biblically, the ark was open to anyone who wanted to come in. Noah spent 120 years building the ark and preaching, pleading for people to come to its safety. The point was, man was so corrupt and sinful, all they did was laugh and scoff, and make fun of Noah; they made the choice not to enter, until GOD shut the door, and the rain came, then of course everyone wanted in, but it was too late. Also, Noah's sons all had wives when they went into the ark, so the whole drama involving Ham, and Noah supposedly prohibiting procreation is a complete sham. Pathetic!",Noah
1338,ramzinicholas,Movie quality and opinion,3,22 September 2014,"I don't consider this a spoiler necessarily, but I just want to say that it is not wise to take a story that has already been around for a couple thousand years (even if it isn't true and just mythology) and create unrelated details which crescendo into a pointless, vague outline and conclusion of sci-fi, environmentalism, vegetarianism, and apocalyptic philosophy.This movie was very disappointing. I will give it a 3 or 4 (out of 10)at best for special effects and characters, but even some of the effects were cheap in my opinion and the storyline was predictable and lacking in so many areas.Sorry :/... Maybe try again in a couple of years?",Noah

The very point of the Bible story is taken out of the movie. The Bible story itself focuses on Creator's remembrance of Noah, and the survival of the human race, but not in the movie. It is just long confusing movie, and cannot see the reason of filming it.Watching the movie seemed like using the names of the characters in the Bible story, and just doing something else. I am really sorry the writer throw out everything that was good in the original story, and made long soap opera with no message, and left me with disappointment, rather than hope. I recommend very low rating.Really bad movie!",Noah
1340,krazzyboy801,Not a 'must watch' but definitely a 'could watch'.,6,8 November 2014,"The concept of altering the idea by adapting Biblical story and making it more entertaining is sensible in the movie 'Noah' and I felt Director tried to please the modern-day movie goer more than the Bible's version of Noah's story. Darren Aronofsky's Noah Movie is about a man who is tasked with building an ark to save the innocent, from the cleansing of the world by a great flood. I would like to mention that character development, conflict, and the movie has an appealing style but apart from that it has poor special effects & there is not much connection between some scenes transitions. Movie certainly has its flaws, I felt the plot was slow at times and it certainly dragged out a little bit. No wonder the Oscar-Winning Actor Russell Crowe as Noah delivers a phenomenal performance, Jennifer Connelly as Nameeh is remarkable esp. her emotional breakdowns. Emma Watson as Ila, springs a pleasant surprise & candy eye Douglas Booth as Shem is sincere. Anticipation after watching trailer was higher but overall 'Noah' disappointed. Couldn't believe if Noah's director is the same guy who produced those impressive work like ""The Wrestler"" and ""Black Swan"". Few scenes like stone giants/rock monster so called Watchers is pretentious and distracting, the float of Ark was really disappointing, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" had much more, huge, better, float scene. 'Noah' should have been a really great movie given today's advanced technology. P.S - I personally would recommend this as a popcorn flick, don't watch it if you're seeking for a film with substance. Bottom line - Not a 'must watch' but definitely a 'could watch'.",Noah
1341,oscarblackwood,Atheist review,2,11 November 2014,"I'am atheist but I like bible stories, don't ask why. Anyway this movie has Russell Crowe my favorite actor and movie like Gladiator and Robin Hood, I was oh my god, this movie is going to be epic. WARNING SPOILERS. So Noah see dream, DREAM. Not visions or god talking to him, he sees dream. Like he is high or something. If there is god or lets say there is god. You would know if god speaks to you, like that story, (don't remember that bible story) where boy sleeps and god call his name and he go ask elder did he call boys name and elder says that god speaks to him, or like that. After his dream, he goes to his great grandfather with his family and they meet transformers? Okay not transformers but creatures that look like transformers. Some fallen angels that wanted help humans, when they were left paradise. But god got angry for angels and they were mixed with dirt and other thing. And this part is funny. Later these angels will help Noah to defend ark and when they die, they will go back to ""heaven"" (don't know exactly where they were going). So you will be ""rewarded"" if you do what god tells you, not what is it right???? So then Noah sees dream, or some hallucination stuff that his grandfather gave him and he start build an arc. But there is no wood to build an arc. So his grandfather gave him seed that was from paradise and Noah plant it. TADAA, huge forest is popped up in that area. Times go by and arc is ready. Okay it doesn't even seem arc, rowboat or something like that. Maybe match box???Then come animalsWhere all the animals are coming? Only green I see in the movie was that forest. Rest is rocky area with few flowers or something burned, in that are there wouldn't single animal living in there. And only animal I see before them entering arc, was some futuristic looking animal that hunted by some people because they were hungry and they haven't eat meat for ages? Someone tell me where those animals comeAnd animals, damn that was worst computer animation animals I have ever seen.Okay, I'm done. I don't want continue about Noah abandoning humans, want to kill his grandchildren, when disaster came, when humans attacked arc and fallen angels killed them. Well actually I stopped watching this movie at this point. Damn I am atheist but this movie is blasphemy and one of worst movie ever made. If there is god I hope it is not same like in movie, welcome third world war and human extinction.. Ps. I'm sorry about my spelling error and don't watch movie, read bible is better.",Noah
1342,gemlb,Embarrassed for the director and everyone who worked on this movie,1,24 October 2014,"I am not a reviewer, much less do I write reviews. But this movie was so awful that I needed to warn people how disturbingly terrible this movie is. First of all, this is supposed to be a BIBLICAL film, it's far from that!! It has so much generic scenes regarding the characters. At times I wasn't sure if I was watching a lower version of the hobbit and transformers made into one long film. I understand they tried to give it a twist and make it modern(adding special effects and some ""magic"") but it just doesn't go well with a bible story. It's extremely sad how such a beautiful story went to waste. No doubt Mel Gibson would have done a better job.",Noah
1343,calvincat123,"Good interpretation of Noah as a man, some great CGI (Not the Rocky monsters)",5,26 October 2014,"I was disappointed by Aronofsky, but I believe it was because I was expecting something on the scale of Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream in terms of drama. Admittedly the rock monsters, barren landscape, Anthony Hopkins' role, the fight by the descendants of Cain and the flooding were far too stretched. But it does show a very human side of Noah, who had to battle his emotions and doubts while following the Creator's call and touches on themes of faith, love, trust and resoluteness. Ray Winstone's character is in a way the quintessential capitalist - in that he becomes who he is 'by the sweat of our brow', yearns to 'stand on his own', creates great cities and and believes absolutely in survival of the fittest. All this is nice but his character is essentially placed in the movie cause it needs a villain. Russell Crowe's character is an extremist green warrior - something I feel sometimes is good when I think about all the things we have done to earth. His character's persistence in following things to the end and his 'psycho-ness' reminds me of the father in the book 'The Mosquito Coast'. The cinematography in the movie is amazing and is the real star - where Creation is told right from Big Bang, the sprouting of the forest, the barren landscapes, the flood (although after Life of Pi, showing floods or a stormy sea in a good way is de rigueur) and the last sequence when Noah gives his blessing. The movie in the end is not great but certainly watchable, just so, especially after watching the fluff that Hollywood churns out. Just don't sit down to watch the movie with some preconceived ideas. Artistic license is used to a large extent.Many parts in the movie make little sense- but then so do many of the movies that come out these days.It is incredible that people still expect logic from a story like this. If you can watch Expendables 3, Thor, Captain America you can easily watch this movie.Some of the stupidity in the movie is glaring- especially the characters clothing which look like they have been literally designed based on the current trends. Hide pants? Hooded jackets? Layered fashions? Typical Hollywood.In the end, the movie receives the stars for the acting and cinematography. Useless if you are watching it at a theatre.

1345,Dambaek,I kept thinking: What am I watching?,4,7 August 2014,"I, like many, was straight off critical of a biblical epic directed by arguably on of the finest directors working today.However I decided that I would give it the benefit of the doubt, and settled in to see the film, vaguely blocking the supposed historical basis from my mind and approaching it from a purely fictional point of view. From a cine-technical aspect the film is beautifully shot despite many of visual effects lagging behind todays industry standard. For a moment I revelled in, what I though were clever adaptations of the angels, but soon felt that I was watching another transformers film.Noah's flashbacks have bizarre a snake animation that is more reminiscent of a Harry Potter film. Personally a highlight are the evolution sequences, which I felt were 'fresh' in style and at the same time I though there was a clever 'middle way' between Darwinism and the tradition Church view of evolution.The film has its ups and downs along the way, marked my mediocre acting, but somehow still manages to expose what could be explained is a danger in blind religious fanaticism.This, in my opinion (as well as many others), in not a must see film. It's a shame, as I know Aronofsky delayed to the film to get the acceptance of American religious groups, who it was predicted would make or brake this film at the box office, however it will drown in the sea that is the current film marked filled with over effects filled films, and thin plot lines, and even just under 60 years later will never even come close to biblical epics such as Ten commandments (1956)On a final thought: Is this film actually set in a dystopian future?",Noah

But then Metatron showed up with the popcorn, so I laughed some more. Noah is a visual spectacle, and highly entertaining, but clearly not for the reasons the producers were hoping for.To say that Noah takes a certain degree of artistic license is like saying Charlie Sheen takes a certain amount of drugs. Granted, you have to be a little off your rocker to qualify as a prophet, but Noah takes its interpretation of events to such wild extremes, even Satan was squirming in his seat across the aisle from me as he watched.If you're looking for quality Hollywood dramatics, this movie is for you.

I don't take the words of the bible word for word so as far as any expectations and the bible I was not disappointed, nor did I have any expectations. I was just sure it would be a good movie. Like I said the first half hour of the movie was very slow and quite boring. So glad I hung onto the idea that Russell Crowe would deliver! Once this movie gets going it's almost impossible to turn away. Had me feeling sadness(crying), disgust, happiness, love, and anticipation all within a 2 hour time frame. Noah will make you see and feel the beauty of life. Of course there is a twist with Noah and the bible but the message was clear.

It is one thing to attempt ""creative or artistic license"" however to outright destroy, mutilate and abolish what many believe to be historical, theological and foundational fact is either outright malicious deification or ignorant greed.

I felt there was an imaginary Noah created by the writer. Also there are some parts of movie that made feel disgusted of human kind. Nowadays, people don't read books, they learn from movies as visualization is more permanent. This remain in minds as real story which is scary.

I don't believe in God and all those fairy tales about the world's people coming from just Adam and Eve and the earth created in just a week, but I have been intrigued by good stories and this movie is exactly that. They took parts from the Bible of Noah and theorized what could have been and what ""could have"" happened to fill in the blanks. Powerful story and good acting all around. I was very skeptical about the movie and had no desire to see it when it first came out but sitting home last night with nothing to do and it came on my movie channel, I was glued to every bit of it! Suspenseful and with purpose from all the actors. Good visual effects also. Excellent story telling and powerful. Russell Crowe is so committed to his part and Ray Winstone was the perfect bad guy! You know the story about some guy who builds an ark to survive a flood and brings two of each animal, but wow... all the details and drama that went behind all of that was fun to watch and yes, for me lots of logical gaps of ""how and why"" of course, but good, good movie!",Noah
1352,mike-lavender-203-826001,Negative viewers need to watch movie again,8,3 January 2015,"I don't really understand the negative reviews for this movie. Some don't like it because it wasn't bible-ish enough, and some didn't like it because they though the graphics were bad. Also some wrote that they didn't understand the message in the movie, and didn't like how Noah loved the earth, yet could kill people with no remorse. The last part first, He talks about how all men are flawed even himself. So to say somehow he could kill people with no remorse just isn't true. He struggles with his sins, and talks about how everyone sins even when they believe they are doing the right thing. The message from the movie in my opinion is trying to tell us how we as man were given this great planet, whether it was from God or by the big bang. We were given this great Earth and we ""man"" destroyed it. I really liked how the movie blends religion with evolution, showing how the world maybe was created in 7 days, yet in those seven days life could have evolved to create man and all that surrounds us. One review said the watcher were stupid and looked like ""rock transformers"" Again, I'm not sure if they really watched the movie and took in all of its aspects. In the movie they clearly talk about how these were angels that were cast down from heaven and became part of the Earth as their bodies fell from heaven. Hence they became Earth and that's why they look the way they look. Also I do think the graphics looked cheap or bad at all. Plus, coming from someone who took film classes, when you make graphics sometimes you are making the graphics to fit the time period or the story. In this case the time period is obviously thousands of years ago, and no matter what you believe it comes from a story not so much from proved fact that we know happened. So the graphics I think were made to represent that. It you want fancy high tech graphic and CGI then a movie like Pacific Rim or as stated Transformers need to look slick and amazing. In Noah to make them a little rough around the edges fits perfectly with the story and the time in which the story takes place. Also let's not forget a lot of the animals that would have been on the Ark aren't alive today. So you can tell that they tried to represent animals that would have been around the time of Noah not 2014. So to close, after reading the negative reviews I really had to stop and think where they are coming from when watching the movie. If you are a big believer in God I can see how you might view this movie, and if you are more about watching fancy action movies that aren't subtle with it's message I can see how you might watch this movie. I would implore many of the negative reviewers to watch the movie again and take a deeper look at the story and also at the words being said.",Noah

Second the movie it is contradicting the biblical text found in the Book of Genesis (i.e. : a.) the Bible says that Noah has spoken directly with God who gave him clear instructions for creating the Ark, b) it is a total nonsense and screwy to sustain that the fallen angels had helped Noah to built the Ark, c.) the animals and the plants were not created in the times of Noah and Noah did not had any super-powers or magical seeds to cultivate the land with trees and other plants) The religious theme of the movie is full of mysticism and pagan practices which are not compatible with the Bible teaching ( i.e. the procreation rituals, freak healing and combat, etc) In the movie the two sons of ""Noah"" have no spirituality, no love for God and no interest for sustaining their father, which also contradict the biblical text. Instead of two responsible and faithful sons, the Director of the movie has invented two egocentric modern young men, obsessed by sex/reproduction.

I found nothing to suggest that Noah ever thought he and his family were to be the last of the human race. In fact, the idea that Noah's sons were not married is false, or that Noah would need to kill his granddaughters to keep the human race from continuing is just absurd. I hope that those who are not Bible literate understand that there is nothing in the Bible about anyone getting onto the ark who tries to kill Noah nor did Ham ever contemplate the murder of his father. This movies makes Noah appear to be heartless and cold. This time, Hollywood went way too far and I am concerned that those who are not familiar with the Bible account will not be able to separate facts from fiction. There is also nothing in the Biblical account that suggests the giants were made of stone or that they helped build the ark. About the only thing in this movie that was true to the Biblical account is that Noah built and ark to prepare for the flood.",Noah
1362,sirandrewkiser,More biblically accurate then people give it credit.,6,20 August 2015,"Growing up in a conservative household, the story of Noah was my absolute favorite story. I've always loved animals and have always loved the art that has come out of this story. Whether in paintings, drawings, figurines, or sculptures, the majesty, beauty, and variety of the animal kingdom was something easy to turn into art. For a story based on saving two of every animal in existence, this movie sure sidelined them for the cheapest and worst special effects they could get away with. Be barely see any animals and when we do its far away and with all of them at once, which makes it even more surprising that you can still tell they are bad effects. All the animals rush in, then get put to sleep, and are pretty much forgotten the rest of the movie. Even worse however, is when Noah recounts the full creation story and we are given a focus, visually and audibly, on these creatures. While Noah tells of the sprawling epic that is creation, the movie could be showing dozens of beautiful creatures like horses, lions, falcons, whales, dolphins, dogs, giraffes, elephants, pretty much any animals that the general public enjoy seeing. Apparently no one in the SFX team has ever been to zoo. Instead the focus is on small lizards and snake like creatures to emphasize that the 'creator' used evolution and thousands of years to create animals. Which seems like an odd point of view on creation to be forcing down our throats in a movie titled Noah. Having that said, the movie wasn't all bad, if not a little lazy. While many people in the reviews focus on how 'inaccurate' the movie is, I feel there is more in the script that should be pointed out. First let's focus on the things I've seen pop up most often in reviews in regards to it's biblical inaccuracy. I've seen most people complain about the Watchers and the water bursting forth from the ground. While most of these people claim they 'know' the bible, they seem to have a very inaccurate WTF reaction to both of these. When in fact, both of these aspects of the story can be easily taken right from the Christian bible, with just a little help from some extra-biblical sources.Genesis 7:11 - When Noah was 600 years old, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the underground waters erupted from the earth, and the rain fell in mighty torrents from the sky. Genesis 6:4 - The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.The watchers are also directly referenced in the book of Enoch (google it). But really, that is all beside the point. Because really, the film never claimed to be based on the KJV version of the story (yes this story exists in other texts and cultures, also google Giglamesh).What really bothered me was the lack of story telling or explaining things or showing things. Great cities were mentioned but we never see so much as a house. The entire worlds seems to be a barren wasteland, yet there's no reason given as to why. How could their be so many people and so many animals left on the earth if all plant life had been destroyed? Aren't plants THE most important part of an echo system? They provide air, clean water, and food, all essential things for life. What was with the magic fire rocks, what's the deal with glowing snake skin that gives family blessings despite being the skin of the snake that helped damn mankind, why did Methuselah sit around alone on top of the mountain for 10 whole years before wandering down for berries or see his family, why did Noah see visions of flood then fire yet then see no visions at all, if Methuselah is an old man in a mountain then who is still keeping the watchers alive? Where did Methuselah get the crazy fire sword and why the heck didn't he give That to Noah? Speaking of, where did He get a seed from eden, why not use it before now if the world is dying?Let's just stop there because the whole seed from eden thing seems extremely silly to me. It makes it seem like a lazy plot device... why is the entire world barren? So that Noah needs a miracle seed as the only way to provide all that wood for his ark.... but if the world wasn't barren to begin with... why have that silly thing to begin with? It also seems like a weird way to force the 'king' to find him. If the world wasn't barren, and this wasn't the only nice patch of land left on earth, why would a king care about a crazy old man building a boat in the middle of a forest. But, with a great cast that does their best with the script they are given, an interesting artistic take on ancient story, and some fun action, it's not all that terrible of a movie. If you can watch a movie without getting all defensive and fussy, you may actually enjoy what the movie has to offer.",Noah

Also, that whole growing up of an entire forest was real Disney-like more than Biblical. Noah's sons were all married by the time they boarded ark, so there was no contention there. Genesis 6:18 ""But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you."" Genesis 7:7 ""And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.""

What were their names? What happened to the angels who fell from heaven? How DID they build the ark? How organized WAS their religion? What WAS their relationship with the environment after Eden? What became of Cain and his progeny? What did the ""mark"" look like? Was mankind really THAT wicked, that the Creator needed to kill us off? If so, what would that wickedness entail? What happened to all the animals that we know existed, but are now extinct? Is 40 days and 40 nights just a simplification? Is there really enough water on/in the planet to cover the whole earth? Would rain be enough? What kind of person was Noah? Does God lay it all out for us, or are we expected to make some decisions on our own? This film, though, admittedly, having a few too many Russell Crowe closeups from beneath a glowering brow, is well-acted. The characters are well-developed, and you really empathize with them. The special effects are good, and the rock creatures are reminiscent of the Ents in Lord of the Rings. I liked the scenes of kissing, touching, and sensuality, because they point out that the people of the Bible were...people. That means they had feelings and ideas and hopes and cares. They had passions and desires. They loved each other, and they had screwed-up families, just like the rest of us. I wish there had been more closure for Ham, but I suppose that would be a sequel. I like that they didn't gloss over the sketchier parts, like when they had an opportunity to save people, but then they didn't. That part of the story always bothered me, and I'm glad the film shows that it was difficult for Noah and his family, too. It wasn't all hunky dory on the ark. If you accept the account in the bible as true, then this film is an excellent pondering piece for a pensive day. If it all really happened, then what were the particulars? Well, this film really addresses that in a very imaginative and emotive way. SO, for thought-provoking biblical analysis and imagination, I give it 10 stars.",Noah
1365,steve_grabinski,One of the most ridiculously bad movies you'll ever regret watching,1,26 April 2015,"Where to even start with this joke of a movie! First it has Noah's family living in what looks like a post nuclear war zone. There's nothing there, including nothing to eat. So why are they there in the first place and how are the bad guys able to show up so quickly? There wouldn't have been anyone within miles and miles of Noah's camp. Then there's the giant ""Rock Guys""? Whaaaat??? Yeah, let's throw them in the story for no good reason. Next during the building of the ark, out of nowhere are thousands of people who make a giant camp nearby. Why?? Why would all these people just show up to see what they'd think is some nutjob building a giant house? Ham goes to town to find a woman and 1 foot away from a major street is a big pit with dead bodies. Ridiculous! She's stuck in the pit, but all of a sudden they just run out of the pit. Oops, then she gets trampled by the crowd? What idiot wrote this movie? 2 hours wasted.",Noah
1366,leonjensen,This was a work of fiction based on a Non-fictional character,1,3 May 2015,"If this were a fictional character the graphics and even part of the story could have possibly been interesting, but it seemed to me that there was little effort put into research to make the work factually correct. Noah seems to be portrayed as an angry old man who has no compassion. God (the Creator) is made out to be a being who lacks compassion, who just wants to destroy mankind, and doesn't even bother to talk to Noah whom he called to do this work. The reality is that God is a loving, caring being who does talk with and guide His Prophets. He spoke with Noah. His purpose was not to get rid of all of mankind and save just the animals as the movie seemed to suggest. Noah brought family that mankind may continue on. If this sounds personal, yes it is personal to me. Noah was a great prophet of God and God is an all powerful being who loves His children. Yes, He is the Creator, but also so much more than just that.",Noah
1367,phil_the_love-15519,"A Decent Try, But Fell Short",3,18 May 2015,"I hate to sit here and just go on an endless rant about where this movie missed the mark, but it's hard to give it much applause in any one area. I will say, the film makers went out on a limb here and took some chances, so for THAT I applaud their efforts. Unfortunately, they fell flat.This is a story about Noah's Ark, twisted into a kind of SyFy Dystopian with rock monsters. While the animation of the rock monsters is pretty cool, their back story and involvement into this world feels very forced and a bit hokey.But these are surface issues, really. The real reason this movie didn't work is because it was all over the place. It tried to be epic, but the storyline kept bouncing around. The main character of Noah was impossible to sympathize with, even before the very weird turn where he (spoiler alert) made the decision to do without humans in the new world. Why? Because he was just so flat. When you're making a movie about a story everyone already knows, you have to include a twist on the characters, not just overlay it with a science fiction element. But even if this weren't the case, within the very challenge of building and ark and accepting the awesome responsibility of the survival of the world's creatures, Noah doesn't really seem to be struggling. I don't really think this is Russell Crowe's fault either. There just wasn't much in the writing to bring the audience into some of his world.And then when the floods hit, things got really weird and out of place. It's like they writers were operating under two messages/themes throughout and tried to bring it together to one in the end. Sadly, this just made it feel more like a convenient gimmick than a strong message.There's enough intrigue with the SyFy elements to hook you in, but the movie falls flat on its face. Not one I'd ever recommend to anyone, unfortunately.",Noah
1368,jbadebekun,Oh No Noah,3,22 May 2015,"Just like many others I too had to finally create an IMDb account just so I could comment on this movie.. For starters great actors, unimpressive script. I was taken back on how every attempt at adding depth to a character, such as Noah, was countered by some unimportant back story. Example, continuous reference to his father. Also, there was some overacting, probably due to the director. The graphics were great, and a lot of parts were really cool and made u feel like, you're actually seeing some of the realities of what Noah had to deal with, when trying to make a frikin giant ark. Now I am a Christian, and I will forewarn everyone who thinks that they are about to see an adaptation of the bible story, please DO NOT WATCH. The movie is almost blasphemous as it makes ""the Creator"" into this man hating, omnipresent force in the sky. But the thing is when I watched this I wasn't looking for a bible story, but a good film. Overall this was crappy, fallen angels-turned rocks? It was just a bad, almost laughable, star wars esque, star-filled, holloywood blockbuster, with the title NOAH stamped on it. It's definitely watchable if you're into an adventurous tale, with no depth but I actually found myself getting bored. 10/10 disappointed, would not recommend.",Noah
1369,Ultramum,Save your money,1,14 June 2015,Missed this at the flicks so decided to buy the DVD. So glad that we didn't lash out a huge sum of money to see it at the cinema.I wrongly assumed that a film entitled Noah would be based on the story of Noah from the bible. Well at least the character was correctly named ...I was sort of expecting a Charlton Heston type epic.From rock monsters to human stowaways on the ark there was very little that remained of the original story. Two of Noah's sons had no wives to take on board and the one who did have one upset Noah by getting her pregnant! And then Noah threatens to kill the child if it is a girl ...One to miss,Noah
1370,tim-38658,a laugh but not Noah,1,12 October 2017,"Well this is the worst telling of a bible story on film I have ever seen. I think the script writer didn't bother to read the original story, or did, but decided to rewrite it entirely, just keeping the name Noah, and the ark as a token. the original talks about Noah and his wife and his three sons and their wives entering the ark, whereas this piece of fiction's entire premise is on something else. And fallen angels as rock-monsters helping to build the ark! someone was really desperate to add some extra special effects. I think this is a mockery of the original story, and feel sorry for people not familiar with it who think this film has anything to do with it. if you want ""biblical fiction"" then Ben Hur is a million times better, without the pretension of being a real bible story. the acting was OK, but if you're going to make up a story, let's not pretend it follows it's namesakes story, just to cash in on ""bible epics"".",Noah
1371,AugustusCaesar116,"A Misunderstood, Brilliant Movie About Human Survival",8,13 July 2015,"I enjoy religious movies for what they are: great and instructive fiction about human nature. This movie soars in that respect. I felt like I was watching a true fantasy parable (as it should be considered and as the original writers of the story knew) about a good man and his good family trying to survive in an evil world. The movie (and Genesis) blame the destruction of man by the Creator on the fact that their greed and terrible qualities destroy the Earth like a virus, a message both relevant then and today. Noah and his family are spared because they actually have love and compassion in their hearts, as Noah's gut-wrenching decision late in the film portrays. I loved the struggle of Noah's goodness against the actual, grisly fate that awaited humanity, despite its wickedness, and the realistic toll it took on him as a man trying to do his duty. I loved the struggle of Ham, who faces dying alone, while Shem totally scores with Emma Watson. I loved the struggle of Shem and Ila against the actual reality of continuing the species (also nice job avoiding the obvious world-repopulation incest). I personally loved the inclusion of the Grigori (The Watchers/Nephilim), who are SPECIFICALLY mentioned in Genesis (Genesis 6:4), so all you wanna-be Biblical scholars can stop crying Gnosticism.What I enjoyed the best is that it unapologetically depicted exactly how the Israelites saw the world, through their eyes. The Old Testament is blatantly and unquestioningly the world-view of that ancient desert tribe. In this sense, it's the most faithful interpretation of their text I've ever seen. Noah represents the struggle of each Israelite to survive in a hostile desert surrounded by vast kingdoms of men that outnumbered them by the thousands and were self-serving and violent, best to be avoided (literally true, in the historical sense). The masterful myth of Adam and Eve, the true meaning of which is today criminally simplified to ""original sin"" (thanks for making that one up to force Romans to get baptized, St. Augustine), is portrayed here as it should be: An allegorical tale about the loss of innocence of mankind. They could have lived like the animals, subsisting and helping each other survive, but instead they chose to eat from the ""Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,"" believing that they had just as much as right as the Creator to decide their destiny and use the Earth and its animals as their personal playground/slaughterhouse. Perfect allegory to describe the evils of man, and depicted well here.I have always had an analytical mind and a passion for History. I am currently pursuing a doctorate, if my credentials in the field are in question. This passion started early, and the first ""historical"" book I read was the Bible, since I was told that it was not only supposed to be extremely important to me, but also literally true. I actually read it, cover-to-cover. It was the best decision of my life. It cured me of the ignorance of literal interpretation of an otherwise thought-provoking, philosophically significant ancient text with nuggets of true wisdom about human nature. Instead of focusing on this wisdom, 40% of Americans believe the story as historical fact. Forty. Percent. Even the people who wrote it knew it was a story. It is almost indistinguishable of the fragments we have from other ancient Near East tribes. The creation myth, the flood myth, and the law code are all part of an elaborate and universal Near-East myth that this region used to describe the origin of man and to set up a moral system to survive. And nothing more. WE have provided ALL of its perceived value, and could have easily, arbitrarily done the same for the Sumerians, Hittites, or Akkadians, for example.My parents went to see this movie because they are good Catholics. They like going to Church on Sundays, have a generic idea of scripture from the readings in Church, popular culture and family prayers, verses, etc. etc. They go to see every movie based on the Bible: The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur, King of Kings, The Passion of the Christ, The Nativity, etc. Most of these traditional interpretations received rave reviews. They hated this movie. They thought it was ""ridiculous"" and ""unrealistic"" and ""what's the deal with the rock monsters?"" Unrealistic? What did you expect to see? A BELIEVABLE version of a story where two of every species ON THE ENTIRE EARTH get onto a boat to survive? Keep in mind that the Israelites knew a grand total of 2000-square-miles around them, if that, and it was mostly desert, so their version makes a lot more sense considering that this includes probably 100 species at most. The real world contains some millions of species: Some of which are from the edges of the Earth (from the Middle East), including things they could never dream of like the finches of the Galapagos, the marsupials of Australia, the penguins of Antarctica, the fauna of the Amazon rainforest, cave-dwellers, extremophiles; all species tailored to finely-tuned, delicate ecosystems that can't just be restored overnight after the WHOLE WORLD FLOODS.I think my parents (and Bible-literalists in general) hated this movie because it WAS faithful, and therefore pointed out the obviousness of the story as a fantasy tale. The film struck me from the start as being purely an Israelite fantasy version of the world. In fact, they (the actual writers of the Bible) would probably have loved this movie. By the way, I loved the evolutionary montage of the animals evolving from the first single-celled ancestor. Just as we get to monkeys, the screen flashes to white and BOOM! Mankind. I see what you did there, Darren. Wink wink.",Noah
1372,jlonewolf,Liberal Crackpottery Meets Scripture,4,4 October 2015,"This cinematic effort is noteworthy for its scope and effort. The special effects are not top of the line, but still effective in my view. Those who created this barely Biblical nonsense obviously did not set out to make an entertainment product that would appeal to the Biblical believer, but only to the drug-using millenial populace.I submit that for the cave dwellers who have never had exposure to Scripture in an orthodox venue, this movie is simply a Ray Harryhausen fantasy Sinbad movie with a better level of special effects.This movie rates a four for its cinematic quality, general production value and qualified actors.

1374,currentcreative-68855,"Fantastic movie, only religious zealots could disagree",10,2 April 2016,"Just caught this movie for free on Amazon Prime and I suggest you do as well while it's still free on Prime. I have been studying religion for about 30 years now and was shocked and delighted to discover this movie is the first of its kind: one that actually takes books other than the canonical Bible into consideration and also doesn't shy away from what is in the actual Bible. The top reviewer over on Amazon explained this all well enough that I'm not going to put any effort into making the same case myself. I suggest you just search for Noah on Amazon Prime and see the top rated review for Noah there to learn more about religious aspects behind it from a Jewish perspective. Christians often don't seem to care about anything but what they were taught growing up.I'm going to ramble on a bit about what people take issue with and why as a way of justifying the movie to you and why I am urging you to go see it because if I really get into specifics of the movie, the movie is so shockingly different than what you might be expecting that any specifics I give would amount to spoilers. And I don't want to spoil the movie for you. I just finished it and plan to watch it again tomorrow with my wife because I thought it was such a cool movie.So here goes:Seeing so many Christians' hatred and outrage for this movie various places was the reality check I needed to really drive the point home once again that it's not just people in obscure cults that are blinded and driven mad by their beliefs; it's also very ordinary common people as well who are so prevalent and ""normal"" according to their peers that they feel completely self-assured in their views they are actually willing to sign their name to reviews on Brietbart, etc. without an inkling of self-awareness that there could possibly be more angles to this and that they potentially should be very embarrassed for being so cocksure about something they really have no right to be so cocksure about. It's rather like the people who are proud to say the earth is only 6,000 years old and mankind coexisted with dinosaurs. That level of certainty in what are very tenuous beliefs, at best, is mind-boggling. These reviewers are upset by notions they have never heard before because they don't do any real Biblical research. These people seem to have never taken into consideration any hermeneutical literature on the subject or particularly Jewish interpretation of their own scriptures; after all Jews came up with this stuff, preserved it and kept the oral tradition of their beliefs alive all these years. The people who hate this film on religious grounds don't seem to have any awareness, either, that modern Christian interpretation of the Bible has gotten more and more figurative as time marches on because science has proved various verses must be figurative. This is even true for the fundamental literalists; there are some passages even they take figuratively today that everyone took literally 300 years ago. And they don't like to admit how much symbolism is still not revealed to them since it calls into question what they believe they know about the rest of it.Do yourself a favor and do not pay any attention to the negative reviews. This is a fantastic and original movie that is far from your average boring Bible story. It's actually quite a bit more realistic, more human, and quite possibly closer to what really happened (if you believe any of the Bible). After all, the Sethian Gnostics basically believed in nearly an opposite belief system to the common myths most people are familiar with today, which were created by the Flavian dynasty and a traitor named Josephus (look it up).It amazes me how many people simply disregard all the older Christian writings as if they are false, wicked, apocryphal books without the slightest consideration just because one group of people say so, especially when that one group is very questionable in their standards of truthiness. That is one hilarious leap of faith and a terrible leap of logic.Once you watch the movie, if you have questions about where the director came up with these ideas, check out that top rated review on Amazon again. Read it closely. Then start looking into hermeneutical literature and so-called ""gnostic texts,"" etc. Anyone who's seriously been studying the Bible for several years and has bothered to learn to read Hebrew and Koine Greek to do so knows it is nowhere near as cut-and-dried as the average Bible thumper seems to think.Absolutely fantastic movie....and again, sorry not many specifics on the movie, but anything I might have said would be a potential spoiler. Just know it is very different from the simplistic fairy tale you heard about an old man building a big boat and leading all the animals in the world into it two by two.",Noah
1375,x-51593,"Okay, but not a ""must see"" movie",7,3 December 2015,"The movie Noah is based on the bible story of Noah's Ark. The movie starts with a scene of young Noah with his father, and then it jumps to adult Noah with his wife and three sons. Noah is asked by God to built an ark, and to bring two of every animal into the ark with him. Noah finishes building the ark and starts to let the animals in. However, one of Noah's sons realizes that he needs to find a wife, so he leaves the ark to go find one minutes before the rain starts to fall.Noah's family continues to live their life with twists and turns. This movie shows the story of Noah and his ark, similar to the story in the Bible, (Genesis chapters 6-9) However, many parts are added to the movie that are a bit irrelevant. This movie made me realize that Noah had a very big job to do. He was trusted by God to built the ark and keep all living things safe. God wanted to make the world more peaceful, and so he made it rain for several nights to change the world and to get rid of imperfections and violence. The movie also proved to me that God is always present and that if you have trust in God then he will have trust in you. Some scenes which match the bible's verses are in Genesis 6:2. It says ""The sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose."" The movie showed this when one of Noah's sons realizes that he needs to find a wife. The son then sets off to the Human Camp to try to find a girl just before the rain starts to pour. Another scene that matches the bible's verse is in Genesis 6:11. It says that the earth was filled with violence. The movie showed this by adding a lot of action. I feel like they went a little over with the amount of action, but it really showed that the earth was imperfect and filled with violence.Overall, I occasionally found the movie engaging and interesting. Some parts were a little boring and unnecessary. The scenery was beautiful and I found the scenes with the animals really cool. It would have been more beneficial if there were more scenes focused on the animals since I felt like that scene was a bit rushed. The movie was filled with action and lots of thrilling events were added. I was expecting less action, since this is a story based on the bible. However, the movie did try to portray the story of Noah and his ark. I wouldn't really recommend this movie as a must see, but if you want to get a better idea of Noah's story, then it's worth watching.",Noah
1376,t-45743,Noah Review,6,9 December 2015,"The movie Noah is about verses Genesis:6-9. In the story, men where being very greedy and selfish, so god decided to wipe all the evil out of the world and make the world a place sin free. God told Noah to build an Ark that will withstand the flood god will place. Other instructions where that Noah will put 2 of each animal on the ark, 1 male and the other female. In the movie it projected that men are really selfish as they will do anything for their own need. When Ham finally got himself a girl and she got trapped in the trap, Noah nothing to save her but grabbed Ham and told him to get on the ark. Ham took revenge by setting up a trap for Noah and nearly for him getting killed. Genesis 6:5.In the movie it displayed that Shem and his wife gave birth to two sons. In the bible it stated that So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives. (Genesis 8:18) Did not mention a single word about having any child of all. I wondered if the movie was trying to drag and make the movie more interesting by adding that scene. This movie was a pretty well movie with pretty well animated with many scenes that looked so detailed and very realistic. I didn't like scene where it was story telling it was very boring and not as important. The flashbacks and the slow pictures in the movie were very powerful as it kept reminding the audience that this was going happen and why.",Noah
1377,b-92944,"Biblically Inaccurate, but Engaging and Mostly True to Story",7,7 December 2015,"The movie Noah is an interpretation of a story from the book of Genesis. This tale relates the experience of Noah and his family as he is ordered by God to save all the innocent animals as he floods the world and its' sins. At this point in time, evil was widespread. The only innocent people were Seth's descendants, including Noah, who were the only people at that time who followed God's words. To save all the innocent, Noah builds an ark for all animals with the help of the Fallen Angels, or the Watchers. However, he meets crisis both internally and externally as his sons' somewhat hedonistic views clash with his seemingly absurd attachment with God's teachings. Furthermore, the descendants of Cain, the evil men, continuously plan to sabotage the ark and murder Noah. In my opinion, this struggle that Noah goes through is portrayed in a stirring and moving way. In addition, this struggle presents a new way of viewing the Genesis story, shedding light on the strenuous mental aspect incorporated in Noah's journey. Though a good movie in a technical manner, some parts of the movie were incorrect biblically speaking and could be condemned. One major misinterpretation in the novel is the existence of the Watchers, referred to as the Fallen Angels, in Noah's building of the ark. In the movie, these rock giants play a huge role in the construction of the ark, being the main workforce of Noah's project. Later on in the plot, they fend off the evil men attempting to get on Noah's ark in response to the incoming storm and flood. As they fall, God forgives the Watchers for their previous sins, and their angelic soul is freed from their body and they gloriously ascend to heaven. Funny, because none of this actually occurs in Noah's story. In fact, the Fallen Angels aren't even mentioned in the book of Genesis. However, they are not completely made up, for they are mentioned in the book of Enoch as angels who betrays God by having affairs with human women. God punishes them by sending them down to the Earth. Another major problem that many Christian critics, including me, have with the movie is the stubbornly extremist view that Noah has. You may say he is portrayed as the current day equivalent of a religious extremist. He plans to end the lives of everybody in his family, including himself, asserting that it is God's wish. Even more disturbing is when Noah's adopted daughter and his eldest son, Shem, marries and has two twin sisters. He claims that it is God's will for the two to be killed, since humanity will continue with their existence. He is so attached to this idea that his family members called him crazy as relations within Noah's family grew worse. In the end, he spares the lives of the sisters, but I still find it disturbing that the director decided to portray Noah in an absurd way with no relevance to the Bible. Finally, it is important to note that the director not only dramatized Noah's character, it did the same for the plot. For instance, the Tubal- Cain, the evil men, are not as directly involved in the Bible as they are in the movie. In the movie, we see these men attempt to murder Noah numerous times, and go on the ark as it is about to depart. This is a misinterpretation in many ways since they are merely another group of evil people that had very little to do with Noah's construction and sailing of the ark. Nonetheless, I have to acknowledge the fact that these insertions of the false detail was somewhat necessary since for the majority of the Genesis story, the only details provided were by no means dramatic enough for a movie. Simply put, God gives Noah a task, he is a good man and executes properly, and in the end humanity starts over again. For the majority of the chapters, all that is provided is details of the building as animals arrive, and chronological time when Noah is on the ark. Like any other religion- based movie, the director had to incorporate extra details to add spice to the plot and make the movie interesting. In this aspect, the director excelled. The plot was engaging, interesting, and didn't bore me as much as reading the long chapters of Genesis. Even though some aspects of the movie were inaccurate, the director generally stayed true to the wide scheme of things. The creation story was well- told, and the ark was build according to how the Bible describes it, as the animals came in specific order and fashion similar to the actual text. All in all, albeit the holes in biblical accuracy, the movie was mainly informative of Noah's expedition and offered an interesting and insightful twist in the plot which made the movie engaging. I'd give this movie a 7/10",Noah
1378,b-47148,Noah Review:,7,8 December 2015,"Noah is an action packed, film, thriller adaptation of the biblical story about Noah and his ark directed by Darren Aronofski. The story maintains its general plot to that of the biblical story, but adds in parts of a Hollywood twist. Noah revolves around a story about a man named Noah, who receives a message from God that the world will be wiped from evil and wickedness, and that he is the chosen one to fulfill God's will.Noah provided good animations, strong characters, and I guess you could say the plot was generally quite satisfying, but it still does bring a little bit of confusion to the table. There were some parts in the movie that needed to be clarified. First off, in the bible, there were no such angels which had turned into golems because of helping humans. The movie introduced this factor quite early on and these golems played a huge part in the making of the ark. Secondly, there wasn't any ""bad guy"" in the bible verses. During the movie there was one main antagonist that caused chaos within the ark. Thirdly, one major difference between the movie and the bible verse was in fact the relationships of Noah's sons. In the movie, some of his sons did not have wives. Apparently, the daughters of Shem (one of Noah's sons) would be the wives of Noah's sons. Well according to the movie. But the Bible said otherwise. In the bible, each of Noah's sons had a wife for offspring. But without a doubt, I still consider Noah to be a pretty good movie. It contains a generally good plot with a set of main characters, and the filming/ animating was also done quite well. But I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone. If you believe in the story of Noah, and also believe in it's teachings, this movie may not be the movie for you. When watching certain parts of this movie, you may feel angered. Even I, as an agnostic atheist got quite shocked when I saw some parts. So, unless you don't mind the altering of some religious stories, this movie may be quite an entertaining one. The well developed plot line, and the array of characters formed a great sense of entertainment for me. I felt interested throughout the whole movie, although I felt confused at some points. Continuing on the bad points, it doesn't suit all audiences. Those who have religious beliefs may be quite offended at the movie, and the religious part of this movie doesn't really show considering it is a religious movie. So in the end I rate this movie a 7/10.",Noah
1379,seancfurlong,** Summary included in review**,6,8 December 2015,"For my movie review, I watched the movie Noah. Noah starts off with a little background, telling of how Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden and had three sons, Cain, Abel, and Seth. Cain killed Abel, and then ran away. Cain's kin were a selfish people that didn't follow God. Seth followed the path of God, and his descendants were persecuted by Cain's, who were much more plentiful. Noah, one of the last descendants of Seth, spends most of his life avoided the kin of Cain, but one day, God tasks him with building an ark to save the innocents from God's wrath. Noah then traveled to his grandfather, Methuseluh, for advice. After his visit with Methuseluh, water starts to flow from a spring in the middle of a wasteland, and an entire forest grows for Noah to use. Noah and his family start to build the ark, when animals start to show up at the ark. The descendants of Cain see the animals traveling to the ark, and follow due to their curiosity. They prepare for war, as Noah will not let them board the ark. Then one day, God sends the storm, and Noah closes the doors to the ark, and the people of Cain die. They spend a long time on the ark, and send two birds out to search for land, with the second coming back with an olive branch. Noah's son then has twin girls, and Noah tries to kill them because God wants to extinguish the human race, but he can't do it. In the end, they live out their days in peace and replenish the earth.I think that the director, Darren Aronofsky, did not do a very good job keeping to the original storyline presented in the Bible. In the Bible, god tells Noah to build an ark, and to fill it with two of every animal, and to bring his family, as they will repopulate the earth after the floods. Noah then builds the ark, the rain comes, the human race dies, Noah goes on to replenish the earth, and God establishes a covenant with Noah stating that he will never do such a terrible thing again, with the rainbow as a sign of his promise. Most of these events occur in the movie with the exception of God's covenant, but there are also many more aspects to this movie that don't occur in the Bible. For starters, Methuseluh didn't appear anywhere is the Biblical account of Noah's Ark, and neither did a war between the descendant of Cain and Seth. Also, Noah never tried to end the human race in the Bible. Lastly, in Noah there were stone giants that helped Noah build the ark, yet the Bible never says anything about helpful stone giants. I would have liked to see a storyline that follows the Bible more closely, but I can understand the need to add many more events in order to make it more attention grabbing. Overall, I would rate this movie a 3 out of 5 stars because it didn't stick to the Biblical version of Noah's Ark. It was well made with an entertaining storyline, but it wasn't accurate, which really stopped me from enjoying the movie more.",Noah

However, as the story progressed , I realized some elements that were unbiblical.I casted aside those thoughts and thought to myself, ""Oh, maybe it's because they just needed some extra events for the nearly 2 hr movie. Then, more and more outrageously unbiblical things appeared. The Bible never mentioned ANYTHING about giants and fallen angels helping Noah build his ark. And that romance thing with Ham and that random girl? NOOOOOOO!! PLEASE NO! Noah's three sons were supposed to be married and then there was the flood. They weren't supposed to get married to the two daughters of Shem, which was what the movie inferred as what happened. Most of all, and this is what completely offends me as a Christian, is that God apparently wanted Noah to kill his two grandchildren. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ALL ABOUT??!! God is a loving God. Why in the world would he tell someone to kill his grandchildren? Do not watch this movie. By doing so, I wasted two hours of my life in which I could have done things like even studying (which I would have preferred much more).",Noah

Unfortunately, the directors need to make another movie about the environment throws the story line off from the beginning. If he wants to make a pro environment movie, then great, do that. But to take an amazing Story from the Bible and twist it and try to insert a bunch of things to make the new story line work kills the picture. The story is a mixture of guardians of the Galaxy, beyond thunder dome and Startrek. I was interested until about the time of the flood. From there on the cast all took a schizophrenic turn which made the rest of the movie boring and hard to follow. Don't buy it, don't rent it, wait until it is on TV or a friend is throwing out the DVD and just borrow it.",Noah
1384,wolfmichaels,This is not the story of Noah,1,3 June 2016,"I was excited to see what Hollywood could do with today's graphic technology, and with a great actor like Russell Crowe playing Noah. It took only a few minutes to realize that I was in for a long boring movie. I did watch this on a recorded device and long after it came out, so I should have known it was horrible, but i often like movies that have bad reviews, so thought I'd give this a look. It simply isn't the story of Noah. That's the first thing you'll have to absorb if you watch it, if you want to make it at all palatable. Somehow the world is desolate, a King wants the arc (a king that doesn't believe in following God somehow believes God will send the rains with only a few seconds of conversation??) Noah's Grandfather can do magic. Oh.. and Noah thinks that his family's fate is to die out and humanity along with it. So much so that his son's child must be killed in order to preserve that fate. Oh.. and somehow fallen angles help build the arc. Oh.. and they're big Rock creatures that somehow can be stabbed to death with spears. The writers and director would have done better to not even mention Noah and just come up with some ancient action movie. People could have drawn the line to Noah with the flood and arc, and the filmmakers would have been off the hook. Even then, it was just a bad movie. The main character was not at all likable, not even a good anti-hero. His family followed him to a fault, but stood against him when they could. The main point of the film was that animals are good, and were the only ones worth saving. Eating meat was shown as one of the greatest sins you could commit, even worse than killing humans. (Ironic for a film that didn't use any animals in it's filming). So if you want to see how not to make a movie, this one is for you.",Noah

I was surprised and glad to finally watch it this evening. The story of Noah of course has been embellished from the Biblical version but who actually knows what happened. Anyway accuracy aside, the watchers element I felt added to the whole unknown element that any spiritual story has, while keeping it light and fast paced. Good balance between the spiritual element of praying and the human element of waiting and having to make decisions.

I thought perhaps with Russel in the movie it could have SOME redeeming quality. I was so wrong. Does this movie deserve credit for anything? NO! SOME of the scenery was good.

Everyone seems to assume that the screenplay was constructed by stretching a two-page fable into a two-hour epic, and that simply is not the case. The plot and content of this movie draw on the extensive Hebrew mythology surrounding the story of Noah and the flood. For example, many reviewers her on IMDb are outraged that the movie includes stone giants that are nowhere to be found in Biblical texts; however, these nephilim are an integral part of the traditional Hebrew flood story (Google ""Shamchazai and Azael""). I found the movie to be extremely entertaining and thoughtful, and I am sure that it would be rated much higher if everyone wasn't watching it with a preconceived notion of what the story IS and ISN't.",Noah

Almost the whole movie is centered around the lack of a wife for Ham because Noah thought that humanity was supposed to end. However, the Bible clearly states that all of Noah's sons came aboard with their wives. Also, the movie portrays Noah as a mentally unstable person who becomes more and more unhinged as the story goes on. This is a radical departure from the Bible's description of Noah.I would be remiss to not point out that this is not a family friendly movie. The violence displayed was fairly intense. The one redeeming quality was the actors and acting. They did a great job despite the low quality of the script.In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie.

1393,bethkaye-49312,Lost for words,3,23 November 2016,"Where do I begin?... I first watched this film due to the cast list more than anything, but I do enjoy a good action / adventure so I thought I would be satisfied with this. Sadly I was not. Storyline: When people hear about a film titled Noah, about a great flood, you would instantly assume that it is another account of the original biblical story, however I feel that this film connotes more of a satire in terms of the relationship between man and God. I'm not entirely sure that the director Aronofsky was familiar with the biblical story, as this film is so far removed. I am all for changing a story to illustrate a different point of view, or remaking a film with a modern day twist, but this film did neither. The dress code, story line and character names signified that of the original biblical story, the dialogue very very modern day and the special effects were almost futuristic. I am not religious and so this movie did not disappoint me in terms of my values and beliefs, however due to the disjointed, emotionless performance I believe this movie needs to stay in purgatory. Special effects: Futuristic, Sci-Fi effects used to represent a biblical story. Not only are the effects completely out of context with the film, but I feel that they are of the same standard seen in many 80's movies, not what I would expect from a film of this era. Acting: The casting was the initial pull for me, and unfortunately I was let down. Emma Watson and Douglas Booth are both very English actors, highly esteemed and extremely talented. I have seen many films containing both young actors and this is by far the worst movie both of them have starred in. Considering the horrific plot line, the actors did not portray the characters badly, I feel they were already fighting a losing battle. Russell Crow is one my favourite actors, as he always performs to the highest of standards, and his natural authoritative figure makes him a well respected, talented guy. In this film however, he seemed to only give 80 percent of his abilities. He didn't seem to ooze the natural grace and confidence as in his other work. Whilst watching the film, I was torn between seeing an effort lacking performance, to seeing major overacting in some emotional scenes. I am unimpressed by the actors choice to star in the movie and give the less than average performance that they did. Conclusion: Waste of time. There goes two hours of my life I'm never getting back. The combination of the pathetic storyline, weak script, effortless acting and 80's sci-fi effects makes for an unusual and unenjoyable watch. Not a pleasant cinematic experience.",Noah

The Fallen have so much in common with Transformers it is disturbing. When looking at the listing of actors that where to be in the movie from several months ago on this site, they did not make it into the cut of the movie at the theater.

On screen, they look and sound awesome like Nick Nolte or Frank Langella.

1399,plane_1978,A Human Perception of Noah,8,14 April 2014,"Envisioned by Darren Aronofsky to be another one of his greats, like Black Swan, The Fountain and The Wrestler does the blockbuster version of Noah deliver? This question doesn't have a straight forward answer, like Man of Steel (2013) the Critics and the Viewers are divided. While in the case of Man of Steel the Critics were unimpressed and the Viewers loved it. Noah is loved by the Critics but not so much by the Viewers. Even though Noah has a gripping story line, the main problem the Viewers have is the interpretation of Darren Aronofsky's and Ari Handle's version of events taken from the Bible. The truth about this movie is that even though it has Angels, Visions and a few Miraculous events, the story is told from a more practical human side. Rotten Tomatoes website says, 'With sweeping visuals grounded by strong performances in service of a timeless tale told on a human scale, Darren Aronofsky's Noah brings the Bible epic into the 21st century.' Noah is different from the other versions which came out mainly because, just before the Ark gets ready to leave Noah looks at man and sees in himself and his family of all the wickedness they themselves are capable of and believes God wants him to end the human race as a species. A lot of believers are offended by this fact. Led by Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, the main cast delivers some great acting, and this movie unlike the other versions of Noah shows a more practical way of how the events happened during that time, and it doesn't dwell too much on the technical details. After the Ark leaves the whole story is concentrated on Noah's family, how Noah turns into a villain in the latter part of the movie, how his decisions make his family hate him, how he struggles to do the right thing and how his family, except for his second son forgives him. Rotten Tomatoes, a websites run by Critics, gives this movie a 76% rating and say only 47% of the audience who watch this movie likes it. IMDb website run by viewers, gives it a 6.7 rating out of 10. I agree with the critics, and give it a higher rating like 8 out of 10.The viewers have come to think of this movie as a larger than life hero, clear in his vision from God undertakes this mission, and everything is happy and goes according to the simple story in the Bible told to children. First of all don't take your children, because it's not a children's movie and second if you are a Christian or Muslim (Roman Catholic, Protestant, or any of those who believe in God), please think of this from a human point of view without being judgmental.",Noah

And while I didn't dislike the movie, it would have to have made a rating of 7 or better to make it into my video library, this one won't.The actual role of Noah becomes very dark through the movie, as is the overall theme of the movie.

And so here, there is this twist that while in the Ark, Mr Aronofsky's Noah, and not the Noah in the Bible, gets this idea that he should kill the newborn children of one of his sons wives, but only if they are girls But in the end he relents, thinking he disappointed God, because he couldn't do it because of the love he felt for his own grand children. And also this one, right at the beginning just after the birds get into the Ark, the snakes move in. Which in symbolic way means, that all the lying prophets force their way into churches, trying to get to heaven to be saved, while they deceive everyone else. So beware of false movie script writers. All this has to do with ""the man of lawlessness"", see 2Th2 in the Bible.However, once you know the Holy Scripture it is a good practice to watch movies and trying to figure out where the message gets twisted, again as a good practice to discern false teachings. I did this a lot, and it is fun, kind of because you can also feel sad why these people have this need to twist biblical accounts the way they do.John 15:26 and 16,John 15:26 (NIV 1984)26 When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me. 27 And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning. 1 ""All this I have told you so that you will not go astray. 2 They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God. 3 They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. 4 I have told you this, so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you.

Being neither author nor critic, but a reasoned mind with a complex understanding of early earth mythology and Christian worldview specifically, even as it relates to creation, I can say with great clarity of confidence that this movie was as dramatically inclined as was most fitting for how very well may could have told one such of the many great stories that is the history of mankind.

1408,morriscrichlow,"As a Christian, 4 things I got past, and 4 things I didn't",1,30 March 2014,"While watching this movie, I found myself able to get past certain things, so that I was still open to it turning out well at the point the rain started falling. 4 Things I got past: 1. That this is not a literal interpretation of the Bible. I was very aware of this, and I saw the movie anyway, because even movies (Star Wars) or books (The Dresden Files) that have nothing to do with the Bible can be Christian, about compassion, hope, and faith. 2. That God punished a bunch of angels for trying to help mankind. God didn't do that Biblically, and a Christian wouldn't believe that he would. The group of angels whose likeness was depicted in this movie were punished for disobeying God by having sex with humans, not for trying to help Adam and Eve as the movie suggested. 3. That God wants his servants to kill people who would kill animals. Let us not forget that most of the significant figures who worship in the Old Testament honor God by sacrificing animals. Samuel called out Saul for sparing sheep from sacrifice, because God had commanded the sacrifice. 4. That Noah's son and would-be daughter would have sex before getting married. This is a family that Biblically was saved because they kept to God's Word. 4 Things I couldn't get past: 1. That a great man of faith would more easily seek to kill his own baby grandchildren than build an ark. No one would be intentionally hurt by Noah's building the ark, yet the movie portrays Noah as so questioning his mission that he made a very dangerous journey to seek counsel over whether it was his duty. Yet just because the rain stops Noah accepts without meditation or Biblical reflection that he must kill his grandchildren, at which point he rejects all counsel, and proceeds to torment his children and wife. 2. That God does not provide. Noah assures his son Ham that God will provide him a wife, then Noah sets out to procure one for Ham on his own and fails; and when without Noah's help Ham finds one, we're to believe that a man who devotes his entire life to faith should leave his son's wife to die because his enemies chase him. Of course, God did provide wives for all three sons in the Biblical story. 3. That God wants us to show our faith by disobeying what He commands. The end of the movie reframes Noah's failing to follow what he comes to believe is God's command as a test in which God really wanted Noah to disobey him. Of course, the whole point of the Biblical Noah story is that he and his family among all the world are the ones God chooses to spare because God loves humanity so much He won't give up, as long as one family follows his commands. 4. That God just might hate humanity, and that's why he sends the flood. The movie shows how God created animals before man, and then man shows up and messes everything up. Noah questions whether human beings should survive considering what we do to each other. Nowhere is mentioned the kind of terrible things animals do to each other, nor how their lack of discernment would make them incapable of obeying God's commands.To call this ""artistic license"" is like saying JFK was factually based. If Aronofsky wanted to tell a story about some doomsday prepper named Joe Bob who has acid visions with his family that come true, then goes crazy, he can have at it. But to take the name of a Biblical story and turn upside down so much of what it stands for is...something an atheist would do ;)",Noah

1411,coker1971-1,The Most Inaccurate bible movie ever !,1,5 April 2014,"My take on this sorry mess of a movie is that it may have been done deliberately to give a false view of God to those unfamiliar with biblical truths. Anyone intending to watch this movie should first read the book of genesis even if you are not the religious type not to be fooled by the lies in this movie. I will list all the lies below to make it easy.1, The serpent skin Noah's father wrapped around his arm which lists the descendants isn't biblical at all 2' The watchers were a form of angels that god had sent to help and protect the righteous on earth. They also guarded the garden of Eden and protected Adam and Eve. They weren't transformed into rock like transformers as the film depict. Instead the fallen angels who had rebelled against god and took earthly women for wives were cursed by god and bound in Tartarus (holding ground for fallen angels) for for bearing offspring with these women called the Nephillim. These were giants that had human form. These Giants were never shown in the movie as they lived in Noah's time. And no the watchers never helped him build the Ark as the film depicts 3,Noah spoke directly to God. There was no grandpa mediator. God even told Noah the exact measurement he should build the Ark. The scene of the Grandpa drugging him to see God's vision isn't biblical nor is the scene were he gives Noah a seed like shrub to plant into order to produce a forest to build the ark isn't biblical either.4, All Noah's three sons were married when they entered the Ark. In the film only the oldest Son had a wife who was initially barren till the grandpa with supposedly superpowers heals her and she conceives to have twins ! The inaccuracies just goes on and on. Not forgetting the good hearted Noah all of a sudden turns psycho and potential baby killer in the ark and the Descendant of Cain Villain king manages to stowaway onto the Ark ! Also how was Noah's second son Ham going to start a generation without a spouse since he was shown in the film not to have one ? This movie should be avoided at all cost but if you are to watch it read up the biblical account first so as to not believe lies the movie depicts",Noah

1413,KJSanders,"I laughed, but not in a good way.",2,19 April 2015,"As a non-religious person who has grown accustomed to having a good cross-section of my society view their lives through Judeo-Christian traditions, I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud at the utter absurdities that Aronofsky's own faith forced upon this film. The film was in a word, self-important and full of itself, reading far more into the tale of Noah than either the Christian bible or the Jewish holy books intended. Had the film not represented perhaps the best known of all Christian fables, the fantasized, big-budget, slick Hollywood retelling would have been perceived as farcical. As it was, it read as a Saturday Night Live parody of itself, never aware of just how far out in left field it has allowed itself to wander as it became ""Star Wars meets the Bible"" in hopes of selling more tickets.Perhaps most ridiculous aspect of Aronofsky's twisted fantasy was that he brought to his interpretation the expectation that anyone viewing the film would empathize and identify with a family that would narrowly follow the dictates of a voice in the sky, despite the obvious threats that obeying voices in your head leads to. Despite the absurdities Aronofsky piled upon us one after another, he expected the audience to accept them at face value as God's gospel. View this retelling through anything short of devout religious faith however, and the film plays as a piece of propaganda intended for Sunday School classes and the feeble of mind.In addition to this film never finding a clear focus for what it was trying to say or be, I was never able to empathize with the characters and situations that Aronofsky created for us. He insisted on being literal and specific where the bible is deliberately vague and allegorical, as he forced his own Jewish ideology onto a story that he attempted to steal away from its Christian base. His characters committing their lives to building an ark was a clear enough example of diseased minds, but when the threat stretched to the possibility of fratricide within the closed family, the absurdity reached a point where laughter was the only appropriate response from audience members. Unless you live and breath through an underpinning of Judeo-Christian faith, you cannot help but shake your head in disbelief at Aranofsky's forced efforts, as his his preachy world view takes our viewing of his story in a very different direction than he intended. That in itself is a sign of poor film making, but a positive sign of effective propaganda, which tells us everything we need to know about Aronofsky's priorities.Despite the slick veneer of top-notch, design, music, cinematography etc, this film is most definitely in my top ten list for the biggest waste of funds ever spent on a big-budget Hollywood film. It didn't enlighten, it didn't make me feel, it didn't take me on a journey, it just used the media of film as a tool to inappropriately push religious ideology. Along the way I got a few belly laughs, but not at all in the way Aronofsky intended.",Noah
