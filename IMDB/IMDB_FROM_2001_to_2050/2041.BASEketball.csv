0,MartinHafer,Turn off your brain and enjoy...,7,12 May 2012,"The term 'guilty pleasure' is one that definitely applies to ""BASEketball"". While I'll readily admit that the film is very stupid, juvenile and gross at times, it's also, in a VERY low-brow way, entertaining. So my advice is just turn off your brain and enjoy.The film is set in the very near future. The premise is that pro sports have folded, as the players have become bigger and bigger egomaniacs--so much so that the fans have abandoned the games and the franchises have all folded. Two losers, Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the guys behind ""South Park""), create a game they play in their driveway. And, against the odds (and all common sense), it soon becomes so popular that pro sports are reborn in the form of BASEketball--a dopey game that defies description. Can these two lovable losers somehow manage to keep this new league from becoming just like the sports of old--commercial and cheap? The film abounds with disgusting an inappropriate material. You'll see Matt Stone shooting milk from his man nipples, animals becoming road kill (don't worry, they are NOT real animals), an amazing nude scene with Parker and Stone and some of the most disgusting and awesome kissing in film history. This is NOT a film for little kids, nuns or your mother!! By the way, pay attention for the very oddly specific music as Parker drives his VW. You'll know what I mean....",BASEketball
1,SnoopyStyle,"Nice idea, some funny jokes, inferior actors",5,30 September 2013,"The athletic world is full of corruption, apathy, and commercialism. Two childhood loser friends Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) invent a hybrid sport at first to win against a couple of jocks. When it takes off in the neighborhood, a billionaire Ted Denslow (Ernest Borgnine) uses his vast wealth to spread it across the country.Trey Parker and Matt Stone are poor actors. They may write good jokes but they can't deliver them. This is a pretty good idea. There are some hilarious jokes. Sometimes they're even done well. But the two writers can't make it sing on the screen.The premise of over commercialism in sports is admirable. But it seems disingenuous when the money they use to build the game comes from somebody else. It's like a teenager railing against wall street when he hasn't worked a day in his life. If they kept it as a driveway game, it would be a lot better. Then when commercialism comes in, that's when the stadium comes into play.It's a nice interesting idea. The guys write some hilarious jokes. But it's not thought through all the way. And the guys are bad performers.",BASEketball
2,Tweekums,A fun comedy about a couple of losers who invent a new sport,7,25 March 2019,"As children friends Joe ""Coop"" Cooper and Doug Remer dream of growing up to be sports stars... when they grow up they are just a couple of losers. Then one day they crash a party and a challenged to a game of basketball... when they realise their opponents are much better they tell them that they play a new game... BASEketball. They quickly make up the rules and soon its popularity spreads. After a while they are approached by wealthy businessman Ted Denslow, he is keen to set up a National BASEketball League. He wants to create a pure sport without corporate sponsorship, teams moving cities and trading of players. The boys agree and soon the game is a national sensation. Then Denslow dies, leaving the team to Coop. It isn't long before the Dallas Felons' team owner Baxter Cain starts scheming to take over the game and introduce ways to make money. While this is going on both Coop and Doug fall for the same woman, Jenna Reed, who runs a charity of dying children.Given to plot it is not surprising that this film is fairly silly; that doesn't matter too much though as it provides more than enough laughs. Some of the humour is fairly crude but nothing is really offensive. The rules of the game are fairly well thought out and the fact that distracting the opposition is part of the game it is also funny. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are solid as Coop and Doug; I can only imagine they have acted in so few films is because they are busy with 'South Park'. Dian Bachar also impresses as their friend Squeak Scolari, who they treat fairly badly. There are also some well-known faces, including Ernest Borgnine as Ted Denslow and Robert Vaughn as the delightfully unpleasant Baxter Cain. My only mild problem with the film was that it got a little mawkish towards the end. Overall though I'd recommend this; it might not be a classic but it provides plenty of laughs.",BASEketball
3,Quinoa1984,"I laughed, and laughed",6,30 April 2000,"David Zucker's BASEketball is a zany and hilarious look at sports in the creation of a new one (combining baseball and basketball).  But it isn't just the movie and it's zany plot, but also It's stars.  South Park creators and stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone as the creators of this game are great together as they are on the show and in other movies.  They bring to the screen weirdness (the penis scene in the locker room left me ihn stitches) that wasn't beenb scene since Dumb and Dumber.  Humor also comes from Ernest Borgnine singing ""I'm toon sexy"" and Robert vaughn crying.  Funniest film of the summer of 98' (besides Mary).  A+",BASEketball

5,anaconda-40658,Sports Comedy With Real Balls.,6,19 August 2015,"BASEketball (1998): Dir: David Zucker / Cast: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar, Yasmine Bleeth, Jenny McCarthy: Interesting idea from the creators of South Park. Vulgar comedy could have been a dreary sequel to Mighty Ducks or Major League. It regards a driveway sport where a basketball is aimed at a net and the opponent must psyche out the player to make him miss the shot. Trey Parker and Matt Stone render the game famous and play against other teams. Effective plot boils down to formula but its title suggests a combination of ideas and talents. David Zucker directs with fine comic inspiration but it is not in the same league as his Top Secret or Airplane. Surprisingly good performances from Stone and Parker who embark upon the pleasures and illusions of fame. We know where this is headed and their French kiss embrace wasn't needed. Dian Bachar as Squeak seems very funny but it is a cardboard role played as a dart board for insults. Yasmine Bleeth plays a sleazy female, which is about the height of her contribution. She is not interesting nor likable. Jenny McCarthy seems like fitting casting but even she cannot make her airhead character interesting. The film is surprisingly well made but not nearly as witty as its premise suggests. Satiric view of professional sports with colourful sets and a story that doesn't hit a home run but it crosses the finish line. Score: 6 / 10",BASEketball
6,StevePulaski,A Game Worth Playing,8,13 August 2010,"BASEketball is a satisfying Comedy film by two creators of a certain animated show thats currently in it's fourteenth season. Why of course, Im speaking of Trey Parker and Matt Stone and their creation of the controversial television series, South Park. They star in one of the few actually acting films they did that is pretty much forgotten about. Its a very good Comedy and from the kind of humor in this Im upset they didn't do more acting Comedy films. Seeing them come back nowadays would be a miracle since if one looked at their filmography the only thing they've been doing for a while now is strictly South Park. Anything else is minor cameos.Buddy movies are what I love. Two or three friends, hanging out, getting into fights, antics, and anything that involves them somehow finding humor is what I love. Half of the movies on my list of favorites are dynamic duo, buddy movies. Clerks, Black Sheep, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, etc. They're enjoyable movies. Especially when the characters are close to home. Thats what tops it off.Trey Parker and Matt Stone plays Remer and Cooper, underachieving slackers whom shoot for nothing that involves work. After being challenged at a party to a Basketball game, they come up with a game on the spot called ""Baseketball"", an obvious pun on Basketball and Baseball. The movie then cuts five years later where Remer, Cooper, their friend nicknamed ""Squeak"" (Dian Bachar) for his notably short size, and numerous other guys have formed a Baseketball team called the ""Milwaukee Beers"", parody of the Brewers. After the manager dies choking, the team is now in the hands of Cooper who is shy and scared to do anything to change it causing much dismay Remer, Squeak, and the remaining teams. The team's quest is to win the ""Denslow Cup"", the biggest title in Baseketball.I always loved the work of Parker and Stone. They prove to be a witty and clever duo in this forgotten movie. The movie throws in various counts of humor assuring audiences never come close to boredom. Definitely one to check out. Only wish DVD included all the deleted scenes from the VHS release.Not too much to say about this then it's just a great Comedy movie. This is the kind of Comedy the 90s were all about. Two slackers sums up the plot who amount to something much greater than themselves. You can basically name ""Two slackers"" under every Comedy in the 90s. Clerks, Black Sheep and so on. Very good Comedy right here, very well done humor, some jokes overdone, but well done at the same time. Decent cameo made by Jenny McCarthny as well.Starring: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar, and Jenny McCarthny. Directed by: David Zucker.",BASEketball
7,disdressed12,starring the two guys who created The South Park animated series,7,14 September 2016,"considering this film stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone(the creators of the long running animated series south Park it's surprisingly not as crude or disgusting as you might think.Maybe David Zucker(director and co-writer) reined them in a bit anyway,Parker and Stone play two lifelong slacker friends who come up a new game combining elements of Baseball and basketball.i found it entertaining and funny. it isn't a masterpiece,nor does it pretend to be.for what it is,(a silly comedy)it works well.the main goal with this movie is to make the audience laugh.and in that regard,(for me anyway)it achieves its objective.for me,BASEketball is a 6.5/10.",BASEketball
8,cherold,more laughs in one episode of South Park,5,11 June 2004,"Baseketball starts out pretty well, with some funny gags, and I had high hopes for it for perhaps the first 10 minutes.  But 20 minutes in I was just feeling bored.  It would get a few good laughs in, then there'd be a dead spot for a few minutes, then some other funny stuff.  After half an hour I thought I'd see what people had said here, and people said it was sick and hilarious and outrageous, so I thought, maybe the sick outrageous stuff is just around the corner, and watched another 40 unexceptional minutes.  Then I gave up, even though there was less than half an hour left.  I just felt I was wasting my time.Besides not being especially funny, this is also a very poorly conceived movie.  The baseketball premise isn't especially bad, but after showing the amusing process of creating it there's not really any place to go except the lame, purposely cliched plot that unfolds.  The movie is also a little too enamored of its stars.  Why are they the only ones able to do really creative psyche-outs?  There are no other clever practical jokers in the entire world except these two guys?  This attempt at Airplane-style humour has about 40 minutes of material stretched out to an hour and a half.  A lot of people seem to like it, but it's really pretty tepid.",BASEketball

11,bowmanblue,Live action 'South Park',8,15 June 2015,"Okay, so 'Baseketball' hasn't really got anything to do with the adult cult animated TV show, but it stars both its writers/creators and is basically the same sense of humour, i.e. adult. In short if you like South Park, you should like 'Baseketball.' It's about two losers (Trey and Matt – the men behind South Park) who invent a new game which is basically a cross between basketball and baseball in their driveway.Before long it becomes a national pastime. As with South Park, a lot of the humour is vulgar, crude, disgusting and totally 'adult' in nature. You could be forgiven for thinking that Baseketball is nothing more than a low-brow gross-out comedy (and you may have a point!), but, also like South Park, it has its moments of satire and social commentary that raise it to more than just Trey and Matt's version of 'American Pie.' The jokes come thick and fast and, if you've seen Trey and Matt in action, you'll realise that they're basically playing themselves. Yes, there is some character development (believe it or not!), but the film is geared towards laughs over story and plot. And, because of this, it totally succeeds. As soon as you sit down to watch it, you'll be able to predict where exactly it's going, but don't let that put you off. So I'll end where I basically began by saying that if you like South Park (and I do!), you'll enjoy this.",BASEketball
12,CuriosityKilledShawn,Slam dunk,7,3 February 1999,"I've never been one for sports dramas or comedies. Anything from A League of Their Own to Space Jam just doesn't work for me, mostly because of the Deus Ex Machina nature of happy endings. Kingpin has been the only movie that avoids this overdone cliché.BASEketball doesn't avoid the ticking clock, last-minute win, but it does give us lots of sight gags and random madness. Though I don't want to sell it short, the film is also a biting satire on modern sports and corporate sponsorship, something that I feel has spoiled sports across the whole planet. Many players no longer play for the love of the game, but for themselves, for obscene amounts of money.As with his other movies (such as Airplane or Naked Gun), David Zucker makes sure there's at least one gag every thirty seconds. Many fail, but most work, so the film stays on our good side if you only want laughs and couldn't care less about satire.Trey Parker and Matt Stone are a great comic pair, and have absolutely no shame or delusions. But an even funnier comedy duo are the real life sports commentators Bob Costas and Al Michaels, who have the funniest lines and most perfect delivery.It's become a little dated now, a fault of movies that have too many pop-culture references, but there's still plenty to laugh at and enjoy with BASEketball.",BASEketball
13,The-Sarkologist,This is one simply bizarre movie,8,14 October 2011,"Considering the makers of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are the stars of this movie, one can expect it to be quite sick and twisted. In fact it is as the humour ranges from foul toilet humour to absolute stupidity, which is the expertise of David Zucker, the maker of the Naked Gun series and similar movies. Unlike the Naked Gun movies, it isn't simply a payout of similar types of movies with bizarre happenings in the movie, it actually has more of a firmer plot, but it is still quite funny.The main characters are basically losers who have amounted to nothing while all of their high school buddies are successful. Then they reveal to them a game that they play in their driveway, and soon more and more people become interested in it and it suddenly becomes a national phenomena. The one thing is that it is never to become like the other sports, controlled by money and sponsorship, but rather it is to be completely independent and played for the sake of playing a sport. The plot that emerges is rather simple, but it is simply there to tie the movie, and the farce that it makes towards professional sports, together.Basketball is practically a payout of professional sports. The complex rules mimic all of the rules of the professional sports, and it makes a hard hitting comment about the commercialism of sport. It pays it out at the beginning and does the same at the end as well, especially when Trey Parker sells out and becomes a sponsored goon.The movie itself is quite shallow and the theme very blatant, but what it does it that it shows us straight out the patheticness that sport has become. Unlike other movies, it doesn't pussyfoot around with subtle messages, but is very blatant and open about it. In the end though, it is simply an hilarious farce.",BASEketball
14,sol-,Near Sporting Satire,6,12 June 2016,"Two longtime friends responsible for inventing a new national sport attempt to keep their game pure and free of corruption in this vibrant comedy starring 'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. While neither Parker nor Stone is given writing credit, the movie is full of their trademark vulgar humour and for those not easily offended, there are some truly hilarious parts. At least a quarter of the jokes are too silly or crude to work (particularly the nude locker room scene) but the majority of gags hit home with some especially funny moments with Parker and Stone oblivious to mayhem happening in the background. The film misses the mark somewhat as a sporting satire though. As much fun as it is to have Robert Vaughn as a slimy, underhanded antagonist, it never really works to have Vaughn alone represent everything supposedly wrong with the sporting world as he wants players to switch teams and locations, wants to make a profit from sports merchandise, wants to manufacture the merchandise under child labour, and the list goes on. Ernest Borgnine's acting talents are also never quite maximised, though he does make the most of his half-senile, ageing team owner with one of the craziest video wills ever committed to screen! The film's big plus on the acting front is actually Parker and Stone. The repartee and chemistry between the pair is undeniable and they genuinely come off as overwhelmed by their newfound success and fame, much like they were experiencing in real life back then as 'South Park' found a bigger audience than either of them ever anticipated.",BASEketball
15,elshikh4,The American Hamburger when it Catches The Mad Cow Disease !,1,19 February 2009,"Supposedly (David Zucker) is one of my favorites. His name was over so many good comedies whether as a writer, director, or producer, such as (Airplane! - 1980), (Top Secret! - 1984), (The Naked Gun's series - 1988, 1991, 1994), (Brain Donors - 1992), or even (High School High - 1996). But the fact of him being the writer, director and producer of (BASEketball - 1998) is totally a disaster; it's the worst of him till 1998!The basic factor to make you laugh here was the assumption that all the characters is gay, sexually gay. Look closer to understand the method; starting from (Ernest Borgnine), to the silly sidekick, ending with the cameo of (Robert Stack), and the 2 leads themselves having a sickening kiss! Aside from its obvious bore and uncreativity, this tone is too nasty. In fact, the whole movie tries to be as die-hard nasty as it can be. And I just can't get it. Why to be nasty in the first place? Why addressing the animalistic side in the human, enjoying showing perverted people and matters, smashing art, ethics, and good taste all at once?! These comedies assure something rotten with the moviemakers, and bring no less rottenness to the culture. At any rate, I don't accept dumping their trash into my brain!The sad matter is not my own annoyance out of the name of a gifted artist being on detestable work like this, but also because the main idea was so smart in its core. The BASEketball sport could've been something clever, especially with the witty satire against the sport industry or the media. But the movie was dead set on not thinking at all while it deals with thought-provoking issues. It was a good idea, however everything else was way lower. And it seemed that the movie didn't know what it wanted to be exactly: a buddy-comedy in the era of post-(Dumb & Dumber - 1994), a satirical comedy, a pure cartoony farce. In the end, it managed to be something too zany to stand, and too dirty to be droll.Save (Robert Vaughn), who I've never imagined that I would like him one day and through a comedy, the performance was totally obnoxious. For little example, (Dian Bachar) as (Squeak) was unbearable to the extent that I hated every second of him on screen. (Trey Parker) looks terrible in this long yellow hair, and (Matt Stone) seems repugnant more than funny to say the least. Actually, both as the leads were between average and weak. (Yasmine Bleeth) looked stray; they didn't try to make a laugh out of her ever. I think she's one of the real stars that were never given the chance to be a ""real star"", and she'll live the rest of her life appearing in TV movies, shows, or idiot cinematic movies like this one. It gets on your nerves badly when you watch the movie's posters, and find no presence for her at all. They put (Jenny McCarthy) instead??!!Overall, there is a hilarious spirit, but the comedy doesn't hit the mark unless rarely. The real good parts are few and swift. The details in the background, like (Airplane) previously, weren't well-made, or made in the first place; it's some sign that this comedy was brain-dead itself. If the main point was making a vulgar, squalid, and emetic comedy, then (Zucker) succeeded. Here's what I wrote right after the viewing: ""This is paltry, crazy, and sick like a hamburger that caught the mad cow disease""!",BASEketball

That was the feeling I got while watching this; constant irritation. At the 30 minute mark, I had to decide to turn it off or stick it out. I made the wrong decision and stuck it out. This is about two unsuccessful imbeciles who create a nifty driveway basketball game using baseball rules and it catches on and a pro league is hatched. Then a plot point about playing the game for fun vs money and fame. The rest of the slapstick movie is full of unfunny, vulgar, not clever, potty humor. Every character is irritating. The slapstick's of the 80s-90s (Airplane, UHF, Naked Gun, Top Secret) had more charm and 'smart' stupid humor; pleasantly silly. This was bottom barrel rubbish.",BASEketball
17,mattkratz,decent,8,28 August 2012,"This was a decently funny movie, but whether you'd like it would depend on your tastes due to the rather raunchy humor prevalent throughout the movie, though that was part of the fun. This movie deals with two losers who create a game-a hybrid of basketball and baseball-in their driveway, and it becomes a national sensation. Ernest Borgnine has a hilarious brief role in it. This movie is worth checking out if you like comedies and the stars and original ideas. I sort of liked it. Not for the easily offended though. I like the leads and Yasmine Bleeth.

Well, it is all that of course, but I admit that it got more chuckles from me than the average comedy. I have never seen the cartoon that Parker and Stone are famous for, but was at least aware of it. I presume that the humor is similar. There were a lot of star cameos throughout. Many are quite silly, but that is clearly what Zucker, the director, was going for. And for all of the comments about bad acting by Yasmine Bleeth and Jenny McCarthy, the nature of the material dictated that it look that way. The best part was in the beginning with the message about sports commercialism and monstrous egos leading to the end of big league sports. Not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.",BASEketball

This film turned an major box office disappointment in the summer of 1998. Which it was badly marketed by the studio and not many people knew Parker and Stone. Which these two actors/filmmakers are much more known now than they were back in 1998.

DVD also includes an featurette, music video, original theatrical trailer and more. Although VHS Version had funny outtakes after the end credits, which they are not in the DVD! This film has some solid laughs, a few memorable gross-out gags but it's Bachar as the tortured BASEketball player Kenny has the better laughs in the movie. The film turns somewhat flat in the third act. Many real-life Game Players in different sports appears in amusing cameos. This film will appeal to die-hard fans of Zucker's work and as well for fans creators of ""South Park"". This would have been an better movie if Parker & Stone had they hands on the screenplay but sadly they didn't. It is still an good if under-appreciated comedy.

20,aidanratesmovies,"Far from perfect, but fun",6,11 August 2020,"Entertaining and amusing, but ultimately lacking in plot and much originality, BASEketball is perfect for those who are a fan of sports comedies, and dumb comedies alike, as long as your willing to turn your brain off for the majority of it. The film stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the two minds behind the animated series South Park. The two make for an interesting and amusing duo on screen, and you can truly feel the genuine chemistry they have for one another. The film is also directed by David Zucker, who helped to create other goofy films like The Naked Gun and Airplane! To name a few. BASEketball is never boring, nor is it dreadful or in any way not funny, but sadly, the film feels quite generic at times. The film relies on variously overused tropes, and seems to do nothing more than fit the mold of any sports film, along with a couple of original jokes sprinkled within. It can be a bit cliche, and a bit crude, but the biggest disappointment is how it could have been something so much more original, especially with Parker and Stone involved, and I'm a bit disappointed to see their talent almost being taken for granted. One thing I enjoyed throughout though that was a surprise was the includement of Dian Bachar character Squeak, who is quite random, but quite fun to watch throughout. In the end, if you are in the mood for a comedy to make you laugh, BASEketball will certainly do the trick. There may be better ways to spend 103 minutes, but BASEketball does have plenty of laughs to keep you engaged, and enough charisma to make you stay.My Rating: 6/10.",BASEketball
21,gangstahippie,Hilarious film starring Trey and Matt,9,21 September 2008,"Rated R for strong language and crude sex-related humor.I am a very big fan of South park, so therefore I am also trying to see Trey and Matt's other films.I have seen Team America(which I liked but gets boring after seeing it so many times) and this one.This is not written by Trey and Matt, it is from the writers of the Naked Gun movies.However, the movie has plenty of South Park-style humor.The movie is basically about three losers who start a sport called baseketball.It is a mix of baseball and basketball and you must psyche-out your opponent(try to make them lose concentration).Some of these psyche-outs are simply hilarious!.One part has Trey Parker's character trying to psyche-out this really fat guy and he does his Cartman impersonation(Trey is the actual voice of Eric Cartman in the show South Park).The sport eventually becomes famous but the owner dies so the antagonist of the story now wants to buy the team and change the rules.THere is also a love interest and a little kid who looks up to Trey Parker's character.BASEketball is a hilarious film that I recommend to fans of South Park.",BASEketball
22,philip_vanderveken,From time to time this movie lost a lot of its strength,7,29 July 2005,"I must say that I expected a lot when I heard that this was a movie from the director of the ""Naked Gun"" and with the creators of ""South Park"" playing in it. Not that I thought this would be a refined comedy, but I sure hoped to have plenty of laughs with it.When two losers called Coop and Remer, can't get a girlfriend and see how the athletes and other sports jocks do get all the girls they want, they invent their own game called 'Baseketball'. It's basketball, but with the rules used in baseball. At first they only play it on their drive in front of the garage, but it doesn't take long before the game becomes extremely popular. Along with the help of a billionaire, they soon form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities. But it doesn't take long before other owners want to change that golden rule...Not that it really matters, but there wasn't much of a story to be found in this movie. OK, you see how they invent the new game, get popular and then have to deal with all the problems that that brings, but you can't say that the writers have done a great effort to develop all the characters. It's all too obvious that only they tried to put as many jokes and funny moments in this movie, hoping that that would be enough to carry the movie. And it partially is. From time to time I was almost rolling over the floor with all the weird psyche-out's (making sure that the opponent doesn't score by doing or saying something obscene), but the entire story didn't always work that well, making me sometimes lose interest in the movie.Overall this isn't a bad movie. The performances were OK, although I don't think that they asked a lot of the capacities of the actors, and it offers some great mindless fun, which from time to time can be a very pleasant experience too. However, I wasn't amused during the entire movie and that's why I give it a 6.5/10.",BASEketball
23,bkrauser-81-311064,The Meeting of Two Comedic Traditions,9,30 June 2016,"BASEketball is a confluence of two great cross-generational comedic talents; David Zucker who is one third of the great ZAZ writing team responsible for Airplane! (1980), Top Secret! (1984) and Hot Shots! (1991) and South Park (1997-Present) creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone who need no exclamation points. In the film, two underachieving friends stumble onto a front yard game that becomes a sports phenomenon grabbing the attention and imagination of the masses. Quickly becoming sports heroes, our duo's friendship begins to fracture under the pressure of their new-found success, not to mention a rivalry for the affections of a woman (Yasmine Bleeth).Now I need not tell those who have seen this film why it's great. Yet for the uninitiated let me say this movie has it all as far as low- brow comedy. Solid gross-out humor, goofy sight-gags and a lot of locker room insults largely lobbed on Dian Bachar's diminutive character Squeak. Director David Zucker actually invented the game of Baseketball years ago and attached Parker and Stone by telling them they're going to make a Hollywood movie out of the stupidest idea he could think of. The ridiculousness of the story and the exaggerated relationships between the characters keep the rollicking laughs at an even pace which helps even the most cynical of filmgoers to overlook the film's shortcomings. Plus it has a killer ska tinged soundtrack featuring Reel Big Fish and Smash Mouth...Shut up! Ska's not dead!",BASEketball
24,jeremycrimsonfox,A Good Adult Comedy About A Made Up Sport,8,6 November 2019,"When two losers, Coop and Doug make up a new basketball game that adds in the rules of baseball, they become overnight sensations. Soon, the two make a deal with a businessman to start a National BASEketball League, becoming part of the Milwaukee Beers. After Coop becomes the new owner, the greedy owner of the Dallas Felons plans to get rid of a rule preventing team monetization, andwill do anything, even destroy the two's friendship, to get his way.It's a good example of an adult comedy done right. Coop and Doug, who are played by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, both doing a good job portraying their roles. The sport created in this movie sounds good, as it's basketball mixed with baseball, with added rules like psyching people out with vulgar lies (some which, depending on your tastes, may cross the line). Then again, this movie is not for kids. As this is rated R, expect lots of foul language, sexual content, and crude humor. This is a nice adult comedy, and makes me wish BASEketball was a real sport.",BASEketball
25,Beta_Gallinger,"A silly, juvenile, but funny sports comedy",7,7 July 2009,"Since this David Zucker comedy is rated R, I would have been too young for it back when it was released in 1998. I was around twelve years old at the time. The first time I saw ""BASEketball"" was in 2005. At the time, I was just getting into ""South Park"", and I knew that Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of that long-running adult cartoon series, starred in this sports film. Seeing it for the first time, I really liked it a lot, despite how polarizing it is. Nearly four years later, I've finally seen it again, and this time, I certainly didn't find it as entertaining as I once did. I used to think it was an excellent comedy, but now I still think it's a reasonable one. It still made me laugh the second time, so I still have to give it some credit.Joe ""Coop"" Cooper and Doug Remer are two idiots from Milwaukee, Wisconsin who have been friends since childhood. While competing with two basketball experts, they change the rules to try and win, which leads to the invention of a new sport, BASEketball! This eventually becomes a popular driveway sport, and catches to attention of Ted Denslow, who approaches Coop and Remer, suggesting the creation of a National BASEketball League (NBL). Five years later, this league has become a huge success, with teams all over the country. Coop and Remer play for the Milwaukee Beers, owned by Denslow himself. During the BASEketball championship, the Denslow Cup, Ted Denslow chokes on a hot dog, which unfortunately kills him. His will says that Coop will be the new owner of the team if he wins the next season, or else it will go to his widow, Yvette. Baxter Cain, the owner of the Dallas Felons, wants to make significant changes in the rules of the game, but the Milwaukee Beers are the only ones stopping him, so has a scheme to try and prevent the team from winning! This is a silly, juvenile, crude film, like many other modern comedies, not that I have a problem with that (as long as it's funny), but some people obviously do. Unlike some of these films (e.g. ""Dude, Where's My Car?""), I think this one is actually funny overall. During my second viewing, I found that in some parts, they might go just a little too far with the juvenile humour or overdo the slapstick. For a while, it wasn't making me laugh very hard, but that eventually changed. There were still several comic highlights for me, including a number of the scenes involving teammate Squeak Scolari (played by Dian Bachar, who has collaborated with Parker and Stone on several other projects) taking abuse from Coop and Remer, some of the psych-outs during the games, team members trying to treat a kid in the hospital, and the song Coop hears in the car when things have gone wrong for him. For a rather simple sports comedy, the plot isn't bad, either. There may be some fairly poignant moments.In the 2004 ""South Park"" episode, ""The Passion of the Jew"", when Stan and Kenny want their money back after they see ""The Passion of the Christ"", Stan says that it's just like the time they got their money back for ""BASEketball"". In an interview in 2005, Trey Parker said one of the two meanest things people say to the controversial comedy duo is, ""Oh my G*d, it's those guys from BASEketball."" I don't know if the two SP creators hate this film and now regret ever doing it, or they just don't like being known just as the guys from this movie (that would definitely be understandable, since they just starred in this film, and were not involved in the writing, directing, or producing, so it certainly doesn't show the full extent of their abilities), but whatever the reason is for their comments on this 1998 comedy years after it was made, it can still make me laugh. Is it David Zucker's best work? No. Is it Trey Parker and Matt Stone's best work? No. Is it an atrocious film that should be avoided at all costs? Well, some people would obviously think so, but not me. While it's no masterpiece, it can still make many people laugh (mostly guys, I think). I still think it's superior to ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"", just not as far superior as I used to think it was.",BASEketball
26,aciessi,Dude. Bro.,5,28 August 2019,"BASEketball is one of the most bizarre films ever made. Obscure and forgotten, but I almost urge you to see it. It's so inconsequential, and counter-productive, and incredulous in it's existence. I can only make sense of it as the product of two theories that have been floating around my head as I watched it. Theory #1: (perhaps the most likely) David Zucker, having realized that Airplane-style parody movies were dead, attempted to make a late-90's, Adam Sandler-esque gross-out comedy and settled on the South Park duo when no other big name comic talents signed on to the project. Theory #2: Trey and Matt wrote a screenplay for one of their trademark surreal comedy ideas, realized they didn't have the financial means to create it themselves, and hired David Zucker to direct it for them. Whatever the reason may be, the Zuckers and South Park teamed up to make this, and their comedic sensibilities mix like oil and water. In one scene, it's just Trey and Matt goofing around with a camera rolling, in the next scene, it's a typical Zucker set-piece with sight gags cluttering the frame. It's an absolute mess. It's comedy gone awry... and yet, that gives it one hell of a charm. I laughed many times. More times than I had every right to. I love a good oddity. It sparks interesting conversation. It's just fun.",BASEketball
27,gbheron,Zucker Comedy Schtick Getting Stale,4,1 January 2000,"In making Airplane and Naked Gun the Zuckers brought a fresh, novel approach to comedy that fit the times well.  These movies skewered the status quo with a full frontal assault on the popular culture.  Their brand of potty humor hadn't been seen before and it was a great guilty pleasure to watch. BASEketball tries to plow the same old ground but turns up nothing new and original.  It's all been done before and done much better.  It's amazing the Zuckers could not see this.  There are a few laughs, but only a few.",BASEketball
28,KnightsofNi11,"Dumb movie, but I didn't hate it",5,22 May 2011,"David Zucker really never came close to what he accomplished with Airplane! and I would hope that by the 90's he realized he never would. BASEketball makes me think that he did have this revelation because this movie is just pure amounts of dumb. It stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park. They play two jobless bums named Coop and Remer who invent a game that combines baseball and basketball. Their game is picked up by Ted Denslow and major league BASEketball becomes a sensation that returns sports to their original and more respectable roots. But when Denslow dies, others want to cash in on the opportunity to make BASEketball a profitable industry. The film is fairly funny and it satirizes professional sports very wittily in some instances, but it eventually boils down to another cookie cutter storyline that lacks that thing called originality.BASEketball has a great opening. It chronicles a fictional history of professional sports that has some great satire worked in. Then it goes on to introduce the two main characters and I will say that Parker and Stone are pretty funny in this film. Their characters are very uncreative and fall perfectly into the quirky lose stereotype, but Parker and Stone definitely pull the stereotype off well. The story goes on to introduce a love interest, Jenna Reed, that the two leads fight over. This is where things really start to go downhill. As if I haven't seen this scenario in every movie ever. It can be a funny scenario in some instances, but in BASEketball I wanted that subplot to be gone as soon as it arrived. But of course it carried all the way to the end of the film. No surprise there.The amazing thing is that this film isn't good, and it is really dumb, but strangely enough I don't hate this film like I do other lame comedies. I guess it is because this movie honestly is funny. It banks on some really easy laughs and some cheap jokes, but it at least amused me. I won't deny that I laughed out loud during this film and its crudeness really brings a smile to your face. This movie is unapologetically vulgar and obscene and it doesn't hold back. As silly and stupid as it is, I can't knock it from a purely comic standpoint.I would never watch this film again, as it isn't a good film. But I don't regret watching it because I did laugh and it did entertain me for what it's worth. Parker and Stone are very funny and I definitely think they need to star in more films together. This is just another comedy where the story isn't whats important, it's the jokes, and luckily the jokes are actually pretty funny. I can't call BASEketball a good film, but I can't call it a piece of crap either.",BASEketball

30,DarthVoorhees,I was left speechless...,1,15 May 2009,"...and not in a good way. BASEketball is a waste of film in all most every single way. It is offensive to all the senses. This doesn't necessarily bother me, I've seen plenty of bad movies, really bad movies before and will see them again. BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it. The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they didn't write. Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted. His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre-pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes. ""Airplane"" was a revolutionary and very funny comedy, watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person.I have so much respect for Trey Parker and Matt Stone. These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today. Their pictures and South Park episodes are as relevant as they are funny. Every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them. It's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity. I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons. It is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class. Parker and Stone have essentially whored themselves out. The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy.Parker and Stone have never been great actors. They've been serviceable in their films. I can't really find a way to describe their performance in BASEketball, other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film. Every line is delivered in such a silly winking way. It's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way. I am reminded of the South Park episode ""How to Eat with your Butt"" where Cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out, Parker and Stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture. Really it's sad.And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball. My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script. I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable. There isn't any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either. Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director. BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more. Instead we get potty humor. Don't rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around",BASEketball
31,policy134,Wacky sports satire or whatever it is,4,22 May 2011,"Most of the jokes in here are of the stupid variety. It could have been a funny movie but this is more miss than hit.It starts off well with a somewhat clever plot about then invention of a new game - a game of horse with baseball rules. Oh, and there is also the novelty of one player doing everything he can to psych the other player out, making him miss the target.From then on it turns into a parody of the old plot of greed vs. the love of the game. It is a pretty easy target but like in the game, the director gets psyched out and misses. There are too much emphasis on the division of the two friends, Remer and Coop, played by two less than stellar actors, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.I realise that I am probably in the minority here but just felt that the jokes fall flat too often, especially with Matt Stone, who plays his character as if he doesn't have a clue at all. Watch the reaction from Robert Vaughn whenever he tries to engage Stone in his shady deals. Peter Graves in Airplane said some pretty outrageous things too but it was played more straight. Stone comes off as a raving lunatic which I don't think was intentioned.As for Parker, he may have the right look for a movie actor, but he seriously lacks the talent and he is basically the whole show here. The supporting cast are left looking like idiots, basically letting Parker push them around. Yasmine Bleeth is particularly out of her league as a comedienne which of course makes Parker look like a genius. Ernest Borgnine is again embarrassed in a supporting part that gives him nothing to do but look stupid. I haven't seen an Oscar-winning actor sink so low as he has done again and again, in movie after movie.Do you think you will get a laugh? Maybe once or twice, but this is definitely a movie that should have been heavily rewritten and they should have replaced Parker and Stone.",BASEketball

33,nobbytatoes,great satire on sport,8,15 November 2005,"The world of sport has lost its meaning. Sports stars have lost joy and love of the game; caring more about the big bucks and the dealerships from companies. Its not until two friends; Coop and Remer create a new game that takes the world by storm. It baseball crossed with basketball; BASEketball. We have come to the end of the fifth Denslow cup and the Beers; Coop and Remer's team, have lost the game. Making it worse their owner how made Baseketball huge; Ted Denslow has died, chocked on a hot-dog. In Denslow's will the team goes to Coop; instead of Denslow's new wife Yvette. But the team reverts to Yvette if the Beers lose this season. Baxter Cain wants to change BASEkeball so that teams can earn more money, but Coop wont change the ideals of the game; where members cant switch team and they all earn the same amount of money. So Baxter and Yvette join together to make the Beers lose.This movie has that great Zucker comedy to it; which made the naked gun movies so great. What makes this movie good is that there is this satire on the sports world; fickleness of fans, themed sports night - free range chicken night is just a brilliant idea. But the opening sequence has so much truth to it. Many sports lately have become more about the money and the spectacle of winning; it has lost the honor and dignity that use to make sports great, but now all the morals have gone.Trey Parker and Matt Stone fit perfectly into their roles, its just tailor made for them. But that said the acting is nothing special, its so over acted, but thats the charm to it. The comedy runs at such an even pace, its constantly punching out great one liners and sick humor. Its just a riot some of the situations that arise; and the psyche outs are just awesome, some are so wrong.This is a great comedy on the world of sports, though the satire isn't completely explored, its still makes you think about sports today.",BASEketball

35,kevin_crighton,"An almost forgotten, but very funny movie.",8,26 March 2008,"David Zucker has made some funny movies in the past. Naked Gun and Airplane being the funniest. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are responsible for South Park, which at it's best is very funny. Putting them together, and you get one of the funniest sports parody movies ever!The plot, and that's not really important is as follows : Two slackers (Parker and Stone) invent a new sport called Baseketball, a combination of Basketball and Baseball (naturally!). With rules involving psyching out your opponents by any means possible, it soon catches on through-out the country. When an unscrupulous owner of another club (Robert Vaughan) tries to change the rules, it's left to Parker and Stone to save the day.The plot however, is merely an excuse for one of the funniest movies I've seen. Zucker, as he did when co-writing Airplane and The Naked Gun series, simply crams the movie with gag after gag. Some are visual, in the background while something more serious might be happening near the camera, or simply in the dialog which is hysterical. He also directs the material well.Trey Parker and Matt Stone as Cooper and Remer acquit themselves well in the main roles. The supporting cast, led by Vaughan, are all good, getting the performances spot on. Special mention must go to Dian Bachar as Kenny 'Squeak' Scolari. The abuse he suffers during the movie gets a lot of laughs. I wonder if naming him Kenny was Parker and Stone's idea. After all, look what another Kenny goes through in South Park!What makes this work, unlike Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Date Movie and such, is that it's not movie specific. Baseketball targets the sport movie genre, then crams in as many jokes as it can. Recent so-called parody movies seem to think selecting one movie to spoof, then adding other things in will work. It doesn't. Of course it also helps if you can get writers to make your movie funny too!Baseketball seems to have become a forgotten movie. I can't understand why. It's funnier than more recent parodies, and shows how good Parker and Stone can be in front of the camera.It's a very funny movie and one that deserves to more well-known!",BASEketball

Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop ""Airman"" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or ""Sir Swish."" Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called ""Townsell."" I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: ""And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami."" His agent leans over: ""Minnesota."" Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game.

I'm a big fan of South Park so I always knew that Trey Parker and Matt Stone would once again, have me in stitches. On the other hand, I didn't think they were going to make me laugh so hard that I couldn't breathe! It's obvious that David Zucker wrote the film with Parker and Stone's audience in mind as the plot and gags are very immature, but they are also very observant and true. The American Football celebrations for instance, ring true across many other sports and in this film are simply exaggerated. The plot as a whole is actually quite good. The idea of a game made up on someone's driveway becoming a professional sport is almost inspiring and the storyline between Coop (Parker) and Remer (Stone) is done extremely well. It isn't one of the most complicated or demanding of stories but you're not expecting Shakespeare when you watch this!The acting is anything but strong in this film but it really doesn't matter. Parker and Stone aren't bad actors, not great either but they knew what to do in this film and it works. Robert Vaughn is definitely not at his best in this film but otherwise, effective as an obstacle character. Jenny McCarthy and Yasmine Bleeth are both pretty terrible in this film but they're both in due to their looks than anything else. The best acting accolade has to go to Dian Bachar. He is quite brilliant as the guy who's the brunt of all the jokes and gets ridiculed by commentators and interviewers. The jokes are visual rather than spoken so the acting made little difference in how funny the film is.The jokes are mainly 'gross out' comedy, especially in the psych-out scenes which are all fantastic. I'm not always impressed by 'gross out' humour but it is done very well in this film as it is very original but not too disgusting to put the audience off from watching. There is also a fair amount of slapstick involved which is a lot more intelligent than someone simply walking in to things and having things drop on their head. What this film benefits from is the mixture of humour it provides. Everybody should be able to laugh at this film even if it's only a bit of the film.Whilst not the most mature offering the world has ever witnessed, BASEketball is a hilariously funny, well written and fast paced film that entertains very easily. It is of course an acquired taste but anyone who likes comedy and doesn't take films too seriously will absolutely love this film.",BASEketball

I laughed so hard in some spots I was sore the next day, and upset that I never saw it in the theater.The opening montage about sports history, their current vulgar displays and the fictional future history is priceless by itself. It is both funny on its own, and perhaps hits a little too close to home in its criticism of American sports culture. And it does it all in under five minutes! OK, yes, this movie is not going to win any awards for...well, much of anything. The acting is hammy but it works. The comedy is hardly subtle but it works...and there's a couple of surprises from the broadcasters whom you should recognize even if you don't follow sports.Would I let my kids watch it? If I had any, probably not until their teens.That being said, if you liked movies such as Dumb & Dumber, you'll thoroughly enjoy BASEketball. Yes you will also even hear a couple of South Park voices in here.And if you have the DVD with the extras on it, that is worth watching.

As sophomoric as the humor is, the film actually is a pretty clever satire on sports culture. It's not as clever as Parker and Stone's other works, but it should be noted that they didn't director or write this film and remains their only work to date in which they haven't. With that said, the satirical element works fine.If you are expecting something as brilliant and witty as South Park or Team America, you will be disappointed. But, if you are a fan of the duo's humor and other slapstick comedies, this is certainly worth a look.",BASEketball
48,mar9,"Live action ""South Park"" and it works",7,21 November 2001,"Parker and Stone transplant their pacy expletive-ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results. Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average guys invent a new sport, a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze. Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up, along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights. It runs like a stretched South Park episode, with the usual machine-gun dialogue, toilet humour and homilies from the heart.If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us ""Airplane"" and the ""Naked Gun"" series. This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since ""Bullitt"" and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can, but one must admit he's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.For those who haven't noticed yet, Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics. This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create. As usual, they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra-non-PC vehicle DVDA.A special mention must go to Dian Bachar, who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone's rampaging pair of Cartmans.In summary, this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the ""Naked Gun/Airplane"" formula. Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant (or absolutely awful) if given full control over a future film. America, either lock these guys up or put them in charge.",BASEketball
49,jaysilentbob37,I'd take this over all the Scary Movie films put together.,8,16 July 2006,"David Zucker + Trey Parker/Matt Stone = Hysterically funny Airplane-style comedy from the master of the genre. BASEketball is easily one of David Zucker's most underrated films. I've seen this movie many MANY times, and I still can't figure out what there isn't to like about it. My friends all loved it, and I showed it to my parents who hated it. Ironically, the adults I've watched this with all LOVE Airplane and The Naked Gun, and I have no idea what's so different. This film has the exact same kind of humor as the previously mentioned films. So why is it that they love the other films and all have the same reaction to this film: STUPID. So what if it isn't as deadpan as the others, I can't really find anything to dislike about the film.The film's ""plot"" revolves around two best friends Joseph ""Coop"" Cooper (Trey Parker), and Doug Remer (Matt Stone), who had big dreams as kids, but for some unspecified reason, became loser , time-wasting slackers who are always late at paying bills. Anyway, when the two guys are challenged to a basketball game by a couple of jocks, they make up a game called BASEketball, which obviously is a hybrid of basketball and baseball. The game soon becomes a national pastime, and recruiting their friend/perpetual victim, Kenny ""Squeak"" Scolari (Dian Bachar) also known as ""Little Bitch,"" the trio become big sports stars, and face the temptation and corruption that occurs behind the game, putting the friendships to the test.The ""plot"" is merely a setup for a constant stream of jokes and gags. Almost, not all, but almost every frame in the movie has a sight gag of some kind, and any plot or logic is simply lost among them, as we spend most of our time watching the background for something randomly hilarious, which almost always shows up. Some of the best gags involve people such as news reporters, and Robert Stack on Unsolved Mysteries, saying words on TV that can't be said on TV. There is a gratuitous, and joyously offensive subplot about a terminally ill kid, who is a fan of the character's BASEketball team. When he comes into play, many brutal slapstick jokes ensue at his expense. The ""psyche- out"" rule (players can do whatever they want to make the opposing player miss their shot) was a genius addition to the script, as they allowed endless gag possibilities, which while hit- and-miss, were usually very funny. Of course, my personal favorite gags were at the expense of Squeak ""Little Bitch,"" who was the butt of nearly a third of the jokes in the movie. These are all hits. You both feel sorry for Squeak, and yet you want to join in in endlessly ridiculing him. I nearly laughed myself into asthma attacks on more than one occasion, as did my friends who all want to buy the movie on DVD now. The film should be required viewing for (younger) fans of the earlier spoof films. I'm coming to a conclusion that this movie was made for the new generation of silly gag-a-minute comedies, and adults who were alive during the release of the older films of the genre will ultimately dislike it. One good thing about the film, is that unlike most films of the genre, the film isn't really a spoof, and the little plot there is, is actually quite original (I'm referring to the idea of the game of course). The fact that they don't have to set up the gags around the setting from another movie gives it a fresh and free feeling. The film has no target of parody, and instead of mooching off the plot for another movie for jokes, it uses a simple, ridiculous premise for that kind of humor. And it works well.South Park fans will be pleased to see Trey Parker and Matt Stone in starring roles, which they actually do really good in. I truly think that they should do more movies of this genre when they aren't busy with the hilarious South Park. Their line delivery is as good as I've seen it (Trey Parker gives one of the best-delivered s-words I've ever heard), and their slapstick humor is totally brilliant. The way they react to much of the situations, and their treatment of many of the best lines with dead seriousness (sometimes) is absolutely priceless. These two should really get more acting jobs. Nobody could have played their characters better than they did.Being a fan of South Park and David Zucker, I was thoroughly satisfied with this film. I can only guess the reason why adults hate it so much is the fact that the movie practically wallows in bad taste, and features some of the most offensive (hilarious) jokes ever put to film, many of which involve young kids who are crippled and/or terminally ill. But I don't care. I highly enjoy this film, and am always sad when the end credits roll, knowing that due to the box-office failure of it, there will never be a sequel. I had a great time with the characters in the film. I recommend the film to those who are open minded or who have a sense of humor and just want something silly. In the words of a talking pineapple (don't ask) towards the end of the movie, ""Isn't this game just about getting together with your friends and having a good time?"" That applies to the movie perfectly. BASEketball is one of the most flat-out enjoyable comedies I've ever seen. 8/10.BASEketball is happily rated R for Strong Language and Crude Sex-Related Humor.

Unfortunately, I was sober when I saw this movie.""So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lame-brained, supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior ""There's Something About Mary"" in a one-upmanship game during July of 1998. ""Mary"" was a gross-out fest, but in addition to the many gags, it had a lot of heart, which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.""BASEketball"" tried to outdo Mary, but it fizzled in more ways that one. You take the creators of ""South Park,"" Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera, the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck, and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture, a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine, wasting his precious time in his distinguished career, dying on a hotdog and singing ""I'm Too Sexy"" as he videotapes his will, Jenny McCarthy, who has little screen time as Borgnine's not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter, a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters, and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey, Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival, and pointless cameos by ""Airplane!"" alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family. What do all these people make up? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate ""Airplane!"" humor and mixing it up with the crudity of ""South Park,"" but failing in every way.To make this long 100-minute movie short, ""BASEketball,"" a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee, is about two lazy losers (Parker and Stone) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball (hence the title) together on the driveway of one's house. After Borgnine dies, he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team, the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone. Sure enough, the game goes national, and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them. But Bleeth is in love with both men, particularly Parker, and one poor, sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them. Those are the characters, not strongly developed.Now witless gags ensue. Blood, electroshock hair, egg-throwing and screaming are among them. Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital, but he pulls through the liver transplant. Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will. McCarthy, who seemed to get over Borgnine's death by choking on a frank right away, quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene. Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits. There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing. And David Zucker forces the parodies of ""Riverdance"" and ""Titanic."" Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ, post ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" series.And like Siskel, I was sober as well, but I was also getting sleepy. This movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers, but will they remain alert and awake, or pass out during the unfunny parts? If they pass out, then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity. Hats off to them!",BASEketball

This film is no exception, it is what I would consider to be dumb comedy with very little laughs, I may have found one or two scene's with a slight bit of humour but in all the story was very basic and there were no out of this world laughs. As stupid as South Park was I'll admit that it is still pretty damn funny, this is not as funny. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't go out and buy it, it's just a bit of fun. The characters were very well created and almost made you want to be like those two idiots, until you remember that those two idiots with barely any money are actually multi- millionares. Kenny was a very well created character, how he is a small person so he is treated like a small person very poorly and he kind of take's it.

Coop & Remer's team, the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to institute._____________________________________The Acting is pretty good, since there arn't many big stars in this movie. Although I am not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie. There are so many funny moments in this movie I can't come close to naming them all. It never really lets up, and they don't try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious. And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It's GREAT.

BASEketball's characters seem like insightful, intelligent people who revel in wackiness with a witty edge.  Their spark of charisma gives a sense of awareness to their gags that makes them funny--they know some people will think their sense of humor is dumb and crude, but they don't care, they do it anyway.  It's not humor in terms of, ""ha ha, he cussed!""  It's how, when, and why they do it that makes the movie work.

But I actually laughed while watching BASEketball.The story is about two best friends who take a game that they created and and played in their backyard, to an official national sport. They then face problems along the way and try to solve them.The primary characters are Joe Cooper - played by Trey Parker - and Doug Remer - by Matt Stone. They are both portrayed splendidly and humourisly. The acting didn't lack anything and it was near perfect! Joe Cooper is the serious, responsible one that has his principles and goals. Whereas Doug Remer is the loose, spoiled one. In a way, they're a perfect match.The secondary characters are Jenna Reed - played by Yasmine Bleeth - and Squeak Scolari - by Dian Bachar. They add a lot to the story, and make it all the more better. Jenna works for a foundation that helps sick kids, and both Joe and Doug are attracted to her. Squeak is hilarious, and is Joe and Doug's teammate and friend.The story is unique, like the sport, and funny. It was really well written and produced.

Well, obviously finding the correct movie name wasn't very hard, but finding the movie in Finland wasn't as easy...... but it was well worth it.The movie is pretty much what you would expect from a cooperation between Parker & Stone and David Zucker, which basically means politically incorrect humor with a lot more happening than you can absorb with a single viewing... and a classic DVDA song in there somewhere. To me that is a perfect recipe for humour. The only thing missing (in my mind) is the underlying message I've grown to expect from Parker & Stone. Maybe there is one, but since I'm admittedly not a ""big sports guy"", I might just be missing the point. I do like the intro to the movie though.In the end, this is the kind of movie I can watch time and time again.

Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them. Like his previous efforts which include ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"", and ""Naked Gun,"" the humor flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take ""Mafia!"", please), this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for ""South Park,"" its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of ""Unsolved Mysteries.""

78,schmucko,really quite hilarious,8,4 February 2000,"one obviously can't use, for BASEketball, the same criteria one would use to evaluate an ""american beauty,"" for instance.  one can, however, put this movie up against airplane! and the naked gun series, and in this context it stands up quite well.while the writing credit is given to one or more of the zuckers (i forget exactly), it is quite clear that, if not doing an uncredited rewrite, stone and parker at least improvised much of the dialogue or something.  it all sounds like a south park episode, and that's a good thing.  while relying a lot more on profanity than the zuckers' other movies, the comedy is still quite vital and, ultimately, wet-yourself hilarious.  the comedic strengths of all the collaborators makes for a good blend and, while this movie died critically and commercially, it's not because the cast and crew weren't trying.yasmine bleeth is the coolest member of this cast, in a way--her charity worker was sweet and cute and sexy in that not-sexy way... a really understated performance, and one which played well against the over-the-top actions carried out by her male costars.in the end, the best bit of praise i could give this movie is that it is one of the two or three films, in the tradition of ""happy gilmore,"" that i can watch over and over without getting sick of it.  since it's down to ten bucks for a new copy nearly everywhere, i would recommend that any slapstick lover grab up a copy immediately.",BASEketball

The whole point of a Comedy is to Entertain, and this movie goes above and beyond the call of duty to do just that.  This isn't a movie for the weak of stomach, no, but that's half of the fun.

When I first saw this movie, I did'nt immediately realise that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really Matt and Trey, later on.

There is a favorite part of mine: WARNING: SPOILER!!!!The funniest part is when Trey Parker and Matt Stone are at the hospital, and they try to bring the little boy back to life by cranking up the voltage on those electric-heart things, and the boy goes flying into midair. It may have been kind of sick, but it was sickeningly funny!The acting is great, the story is brilliant, and Trey and Matt are so damn funny!

There was very little in the way of vulgar or shock humor in this movie, it didn't need it to be extremely funny.  Certainly no comedy film (or any other genre), in the near future, will be able to hold a candle to the pure genius behind this film.  Be warned, this movie is not ""South Park.""

It was just meant to make people laugh and if you didn't think this movie was funny than you don't have a sense of humor. Trey Parker and Matt Stone nailed every joke and gag in this movie. My personal favorite was when Trey Parker was trying to revive the kid in the hospital, LIVE DAMN YOU! The plot wasn't actually all that bad and Squeak was the perfect sidekick you wanna see get beaten up on over and over again.Yasmine Bleeth looked stunning(this is before she became a drug addict)but somebody needs to give her some acting lessons. Maybe too many days on the beach with David Hasselhoff got to her. My only complaint was the halftime show at the end of the movie. That part was a little hard to take but just seeing squeak dressed as a pineapple made me laugh til I cried. And the Steve Perry references in the beginning were a long time coming. That guy needs to be made fun of more often. Anyway, this is a great movie for someone who had a bad day and just wants to laugh hysterically and nonsense. 7 out of 10",BASEketball
91,brienstevenson,hilarious,7,27 May 2005,"This movie is a standard side-splitter, with little storyline to back it up, but outstanding comedy. This is the first film for Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park creators) as actors, and although that shows, they do a pretty good job. Voices from their hit show are lent to the dialog every now and then, which just adds to the humour. A great underdog story (reminicent of 'Dodgeball')- where a team/group of friends has to overcome a challenge to rise above as a victorious group of friends once again - but with much less of the story to go on. Nevertheless, the movie will have you laughing more than enough. Where the story may fall short, this is the point of the movie; viewers will notice this after a few minutes in...it's just that type of comedy. The characters, cast, writing and directing of BaseketBALL make it rise among the late 90's top funny movies.",BASEketball

Their ability to tackle so many issues in a humorous way is unmatched by other ""creative"" people.BASEketball was not on my ""must see"" movie list but I chanced upon it the other night and thought I'd die laughing.  It is an excellent commentary and satire on sports and how we glorify sports heros.  I loved it when Swish sold out to impress chicks and to grab the big bucks.Additionally, I really liked the psych-out aspect of  BASEketball.  In many ways was a realistic portrayal of what goes on on the court between sport players.Their humor may be over the top for most people but I look forward to many more years of this type of humor.

I was right. Although it's not a smart movie, it fulfills the main purpose of a comedy film; make people laugh. Every time a psyche-out would occur during the games, I thought I'd laugh so hard that I'd crap my pants. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have some of the greatest comedic timing of any duo on screen.

One reason it was so funny was because they decided to take the risky path and go for an ""R"" rating.  You do not see many ""R"" rated comedies anymore because everyone is trying to make money.  They do not care if the jokes are lame (ala Mafia!), they just do not want to rate it ""R"" because they will be limiting their audience.  I respect David Zucker for bringing us a movie with crude humor not meant for children.  Sure the movie won't make as much as it would if it would have been PG-13, but it sure keeps you laughing the whole time.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a great job in the film considering this is their first big acting jobs.  Nobody else could have played these parts except those two.  They work extremely well onscreen together and keep you laughing.  Between the cheerleaders, the cameos, the team names, the sight gags, etc. this film will keep you laughing and never let up.

97,Gav-9,Funniest non stop bloke-o-vision,10,4 January 2001,"Well the main reason I tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park fame.  However as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly.  From the subtle gestures towards a joke, to the blatant toilet humour throughout, along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo.  This film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face, let alone his poker underwear.  Some of the funniest blink and you'll miss it jokes ever portrayed in Hollywood, along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain.I just goes to show that not only is Trey Parker adept at writing he's not too shabby at the old acting game either.  I was surprised with the amount that I was absorbed in this film.  However I'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet, here in the UK.  Sort it out boys!I am, and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits, and occasionally snorting into my lager.  All in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear!  However I'm sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices.",BASEketball

Throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity genre of which this parodies. Don't let anyone tell you that they're trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities;- sure, there's plenty of that but it's all contextual, not gratuitous.

99,dbarbanti,Great!...But let me tell you why!,8,23 December 2003,"I thoroughly enjoyed this flick.  I am of the firm belief that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time.  They have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way ...if that makes any sense.  This is mainly what makes South Park soooo funny.  Once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever, you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed.  That is apparent in BASEketball.  Although it is directed by David Zucker and is utterly rediculous, it has a sincere message about corporate America and the disgrace that is major league sports.  I am also a fan of sports so I find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love.  The opening prologue is brilliant...tears from laughter form everytime I see those football players begin Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea...but, just like South Park, once you look past the absurdity...it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius.  I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.",BASEketball

The sarcasm often used in South Park is a bit lighter and when they start bringing in their own characters voices in the film it feels like a cheap way of getting the South Park fans to laugh, like me.But I still think it has some fun jokes and a pretty odd plot which makes a bit unique but it's still hard to like it when it's this glorifying, I can't find a better word for it.

The story is well designed to suit the combination of slapstick and toilet humour the movie presents, with the Baseketball sport the two leads Cooper and Remer create offering great opportunities for the best gags in the movie with the 'psyche outs' involving ridiculous and hilarious antics to try and make the opposition players miss their shots. In between is the token love story and a best friends have a huge rift then become best friends again twist, but despite using many cliches of the genre they are done in such a way that will have you in stitches, the make up of the two friends at the end of the film is one you will never forget, that's for sure.

126,cynical_thought,The best comedy of all time,10,25 January 2010,"OK, I'm sure this may not be every middle aged person's brand of vodka due to the fact that they may consider it childish and lacking a depth in the plot. However, for those of us who were born in the early 90s this film is the best comedy you will ever see. No clichés, no forced morals just straight up, legit humor. Sure some actors may seem a little out of place (Yasmine Bleeth), but what do you care? As long as there are consistent solid (South Park-esquire) jokes in every scene and wordplay so perfectly funny that will make you fall from whatever you' re sitting on. All in all this is the greatest comedy of all time. Not just worth a rent, worth a buy, and I can undoubtedly say that this is better than South Park. I 100 % guarantee that you will not get bored watching this movie as happens with many South Park episodes. It's just so excellent. It delivers 100 % what it promises, comedy, comedy, comedy.",BASEketball
127,guybrush-13,Serious mistake of a great man!,2,23 April 2003,"This movie is like the worst comedy I have ever seen. All jokes here are really stupid, not original - used lots of times in other not very good films. I think this work could be appreciated by me like... hmm... ten years ago, at age of 12 - I used to like flat jokes around that time.The main disappointment in BASEketball is watching great man like Trey Parker: creator of the really fantastic, full of good jokes, show ""South Park"", also writer/director/leading actor of funny ""Orgazmo"". What did move this talented person to take part in a piece of garbage? He was already famous at that time, and I am REALLY sure he was and is not fond of the script. I think this could be a good scenario for the X-files - ""Abduction of Trey Parker"".",BASEketball
128,Playingpeter,Great Funny Film,7,20 February 2012,"BASEketball is a great, hilarious movie. It's a Great to watch with your friends for a decent laugh. You shouldn't go into it with High expectations. Some of the jokes I do feel where pointless and had no reason to be in the movie. But Trey Parker and Matt Stone (Creators of South Park) do a good job of moving the story along smoothly and in the end bring you a decent story. It is a little vulgar and the language is mild. I guess you have to be in the right mood to appreciate some of the jokes that they throw at you. A mood where you can just accept anything and just laugh at it. BASEketball gets a 7/10",BASEketball
129,lowriannparry,Dude?,9,25 October 2014,"Dude? Dude. Dude... DUDE. ...dude.This is the best Matt Stone and Trey Parker film that isn't a Matt Stone and Trey Parker film. When I first watched it, I thought it was funny for sure but I didn't instantly love it. After a few more watches I realised it is one of the funniest films ever...in a completely silly way of course. Definitely not high brow (""only my friends call me pig f*cker"") but full of feel good moments (mmm...that Matt and Trey kiss does make me feel good).Immensely quotable and the one and only film that I consider a must watch when lounging in my pyjamas with my BFF.",BASEketball
130,SuperstarDaniel,just funny,7,10 July 2005,"This movie is just funny. mindless, but funny. to enjoy this movie completely you can't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film. I still find the bit at the start funny when he says ""want a beer........cock"". funny stuff. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn't try to hard to create a serious spin on the film, too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don't believe. But this is different and just focuses on being funny. I must say though, Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys, coop, remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch",BASEketball
131,ispankmonkeyz,An awesome movie!,10,28 August 2005,"I thought that Baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen! It's witty humour made me giggle all the way through, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so over the top, boosts the film's comedy. I have just bought Baseketball on DVD and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it. I have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout. The humorous quotes are memorable, and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later..So overall i think that Baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see, especially if you're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards. P.s Does anybody think its weird for me to like them both? hehe",BASEketball
132,davekilcourse,Terrible movie,2,6 January 2020,Terrible movie. Stupid jokes. Turned off after 40mins,BASEketball
133,Moose_Man,Trey parker and Matt stone are at it again!,10,3 May 2005,"This movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the NBA to some other rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so funny. a definite must see for all comedy fans. If you love south park you'll love this! Maybe don't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes. some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten, i give it 11 out of ten. i like coop he rocks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this",BASEketball
134,brewvet,Dian Bachar MADE this movie!,10,3 September 2005,"Sure, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are funny, but the real star of this movie, the one person that made it funny was Dian Bachar--AKA Kenny ""Squeak"" Scolari.As Parker and Stone have said many times he's the only one of their little crew who can actually act. His ability to laugh at himself as well as having a wonderful sense of comedic timing turn this film from being a simple farce to a HILARIOUS farce! Dian Bachar has the ability to laugh at himself and despite being the butt of many (most) jokes never turned in a bad performance. His performance in BASEketball is mirrored by his acting in Orgazmo and even Cannibal: The Musical. Never once have I ever NOT laughed at or with him in all of his performances. While BASEketball is, admittedly, a bit uneven, Dian Bachar made it excellent!Long live the Little B*tch!",BASEketball
135,joeheim56,How is this movie not popular?,8,5 September 2005,"I found this movie to be very funny, I loved how it made of the politics of modern day sports. This movie is not as funny as South Park but it is pretty funny. And since I am a sports fan I loved how they made fun some of the more ridiculous things in sports. This movie is great for non sports lovers too, probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting, it is sort of like horse with bases and psyche outs (for the person shooting). Overall I highly recommend you see this movie, and believe that you will end up loving this movie. However if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably won't like it. (but that is with any comedy movie)",BASEketball
136,The_Silver_Dragon,All in one,9,28 November 2005,A classic show provided by the creators of South Park. In my opinion this is one of the best sports comedy's ever created. Maybe even one of the most comical films of the late 90's.So just sit back and relax as you see two genius's (ehm well as far as these guys could go) invent a sport to an extent of pure randomosity.(BTW: This is like my first review so don't get stressed at me if it kinda sucks hehe)If you have heard of this but not seen it i suggest you go see it now and laugh yourself into a new way of life.Now... BRING ON THE BASEketBall!!!,BASEketball

138,saadoon,Better than Dodgeball,8,25 February 2006,"This movie is really underrated, one of the the best comedy movies ever, it's about two below average American guys (Joe Cooper and Doug Remer) who are good at nothing except scoring basketball points from the standstill position, so as a they were challenged by two rivals in a party to play a two-on-two game, knowing their limited capabilities they convinced the other team to play it in a new way , the BASEketball way, and from here a new game is invented and spread across the nation. the film is really funny, the acting is bad but it makes the movie even better, the jokes are new and you can't stop laughing for the whole movie, I was astonished to find this rating for a movie that has a lot in common with the overrated dodge-ball, only it's funnier.",BASEketball
139,cjs-06979,Amazing,10,21 November 2018,"This movie is amazing, the negative reviews are from people who take themselves too seriously or are just passive aggressive about the writers doing this instead of another naked gun",BASEketball
