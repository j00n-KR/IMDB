0,SnoopyStyle,the resort is annoying,4,15 February 2015,"Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Åkerman) are a loving couple with two little sons. Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy Tanzini (Kristin Davis) are high school sweethearts with 18 year old daughter Lacey who is about to go to college. Shane (Faizon Love) is separated from his wife and is with a much younger girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk). Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia Smith (Kristen Bell) are unable to conceive and considering divorce. They give a PowerPoint presentation to entice the other three couples to go to therapy resort Eden the next week. The retreat is divided into Eden West for couples and Eden East for singles. Marcel (Jean Reno) is the unusual therapist owner. He is joined by therapists Ken Jeong, John Michael Higgins, Charlotte Cornwell and Amy Hill. Then there is the overly amorous yoga instructor Salvadore (Carlos Ponce).I actually like the various couples and their family in the first 20 minutes. The peeing in the store is a fun joke. This could be a fun family movie with a good cast of couples. I really don't like the resort. The whole vibe for the movie turns. The loving couples become annoyingly combative. The nice family feel turns into a sleazy sex romp and not a good one. Every instructor is annoying. The whole couple's therapy is annoyingly stupid and not funny stupid. I don't want to be in their therapy sessions any more than some of those characters. The shark feeding is kinda funny but very limited.",Couples Retreat
1,kosmasp,Hate it or love it,7,13 December 2009,"It's been quite awhile since Vince V. and Jon F. were together on screen. Finally the two are back together. And even though this effort never reaches ""Swingers"" in any sense, it's still a lot of fun. If you let yourself into it that is of course.You may have noticed quite a few people hating on the movie here. And it's quite clear, that some people took the bad things of the movie and picked on them. Yes it is predictable, yes quite a few things wouldn't happen like that in real life. But why should they be real? Maybe the ""Swingers"" comparison made some people expect something else (in their minds)? Vince Vaughn for example has his usual moments, but he doesn't play the same guy he plays in every other movie. He is the one who is settled in this one (you'll see what I mean when you watch it). Jason Bateman is great and you have quite a few comedians popping up along the way, doing their thing. Again you can enjoy those hilarious moments or you can start hating (maybe because you'd wish there really was such an ""resort"" where you could go yourself?).Don't expect anything philosophical (the ending being a perfect example for that, being a bit rushed and all), instead enjoy the weirdness you are about to witness (even a ""duel"" that might be one of the worst/best you have witnessed yet ...)",Couples Retreat
2,jboothmillard,Couples Retreat,3,28 July 2013,"I will be honest and say that I think I was more interested in the good cast of stars more than much else about this film, and I had seen that the critics gave it rather low ratings, but I was prepared to give it a go anyway. Basically four couples are focused: married Guitar Hero dealer Dave (Vince Vaughn) and stay at home mother Ronnie (The Heartbreak Kid's Malin Akerman), Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Kristen Bell) who are trying and failing to conceive, married high school sweethearts Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Sex and the City's Kristin Davis), and recently separated from his wife Shane (Elf's Faizon Love) and his twenty year old girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk). All the couples have something in common, they are struggling to make their relationships work and some of their passion is fading, so as part of a four couples package they travel together to a couples' retreat on a tropical island. It is obvious that Jason and Cynthia really want to go with the program and sort their marriage that is in trouble, while the other couples just want to take in the sights and have fun in the sun, they assume that the couples' exercises will be simple talk together sessions, but they are wrong. The program devised by resort owner Marcel (Jean Reno) requires the couples to get up very early in the morning, take part in strenuous yoga exercise sessions, and more unusual methods of communication and trust, including swimming with sharks. In the process Ronnie and Dave thought they were fine but realise there are some problems, Joey is keen to explore the opposite island for single people where they indulge in a lot of sex, Trudy is keen perhaps to find another kind of man, and the others are in and out of the program trying to sort things out. Resort host Sctanley (Peter Serafinowicz) threatens to report the bad vibes between the couples to Marcel, but following a game of Guitar Hero they all sort themselves out and complete the therapy, and reestablishing their love for each other they are all allowed to enjoy a vacation in the tropics. Also starring Tasha Smith as Jennifer, Carlos Ponce as Salvadore and Temuera Morrison as Briggs. The cast I suppose do alright, there are some amusing moments when the couples are together trying to sort their disagreements and reignite their love, but it is all predictable, the characters are a little stereotypical, and there are not enough great jokes in the script or to watch, a disappointing relationship comedy. Okay!",Couples Retreat
3,ComedyFan2010,Doesn't live up to potential,6,24 June 2014,"The movie has really an all star cast which is probably the main thing that drives people to it. I definitely got curious when I saw Vince Vaughn, Jason Bateman and Kristin Davis. The rest of cast are all very famous as well. It is a bit sad that it didn't work out to be as promising as it was.Actually the start is pretty good. When we are introduced to the characters and the situation it seems like it will be a great movie. Only the problem is that the characters stay pretty much on the same tune all movie long. And the jokes seem to be repeated over and over together with the clichés until the very predictable ending.I think one of the mistakes was to make this movie PG 13. This way all the dirty humor they attempted was too infantile, not risky enough and at the same time such young people would not be interested in such a movie, teenagers don't like to watch movies about ""old people"".But it is not too bad. Just don't expect too much. Just an all star cast with great actors, beautiful scenery and some lighthearted humor that is not very clever or original.",Couples Retreat
4,michaelRokeefe,Back away before being noticed.,4,16 February 2010,"The trailers will suck you in...oops too late. This comedy about a vacation in paradise gets tiresome very quick. The story induces frustration and becomes quite a downer even though there is a happy ending...but none too soon. Vince Vaughn heads a group of eight friends who for one reason or another decide to vacation at a couples retreat. Marriages are to be enlightened, not flooded with doubt. Their vacation turns out to be limited in fun activities due to the resort's unconventional therapy sessions...not optional.Scenery is as beautiful as a travelogue with some better than nice looking people. The cast features: Kristin Davis, Jason Bateman, Kristen Bell, Jon Favreau, Faizon Love, Jean Reno and Malin Akerman. I was expecting uncontrolled laughter, but I don't apologize for my disappointment.",Couples Retreat
5,dbborroughs,You seen something similar a couple of (dozen) times before,5,28 October 2009,"When one of four couples decides their relationship needs to be worked on, they convince the other couples in the group to go along on a holiday retreat. They figure that they'll have nice time in the islands and are unaware that the retreats exercises are not optional and that their supposedly strong relationships may not be. Amusing comedy isn't anything that hasn't been done before. It was cute but I was pretty much scripting it as it went along. Give me the set up and I figured out where it was going. It was okay. For me the film makes the revelation that I've lost any desire to see another Vince Vaughn film. He's good but he's awfully one note, with his goofy macho shtick becoming tired rather quickly thanks to its over use in so many other comedies. Overall the movie is funny enough to try, but not funny enough to warrant anything other than cable.",Couples Retreat
6,george.schmidt,Better than expected domestic comedy ; Vaughn & Favs reuntied-feels so good!,7,24 November 2009,"COUPLES RETREAT (2009) **1/2 Vince Vaughn, Jason Bateman, Faizon Love, Jon Favreau, Malin Akerman, Kristen Bell, Kristin Davis, Kali Hawk, Tasha Smith, Carlos Ponce, Peter Serafinowicz, Jean Reno, Temura Morrison, John Michael Higgins, Ken Jeong, Charlotte Cornwell, Amy Hill. Better than anticipated domestic comedy with four pairs of friends go on a tropical retreat to help one of the others' failing marriage with a lot of revealing, soul searching and oh yeah, comedy mixed in for good measure. Vaughn (who co-wrote with Favreau and Dana Fox) is at his taciturn, sardonic best with many of the film's best dialogue and his ensemble lets him have just enough room to hang himself when it gets to be too much of the star (thankfully not the case for the motor mouth's sake) yet without his presence it's a tedious task to get to the final act. Frequent Vaughn/Favreau collaborator (and former child star) Peter Billingsley's directorial debut has a lot left to be desired but is yeoman like in execution gets yardage in his stars' comic chops.",Couples Retreat
7,neil-476,Slight but enjoyable,7,14 October 2009,"Couples Retreat tells of four couples, all friends, who head for a luxury tropical island holiday resort at the behest of Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristin Bell) who are keen to work on their marriage using the counselling element of the specialist resort. The other three couples, expecting scuba diving, jet skiing etc. are disconcerted to find that they, too, are expected to participate in the marriage skills enhancement regime which, of course, soon point up weaknesses in all their relationships.This comedy never quite descends into the lowest common denominator area of knob gags but, instead, delivers some decent laughs and a few insights into relationship pitfalls. The scenery is gorgeous, the women are all attractive, especially in bikinis, and the men for the most part aren't, pointing up a fairly obvious double standard (although, to be fair, this doesn't form any part of the movie's content).Once again Vince Vaughan fails to stretch himself.It is worth mentioning a gloriously funny performance from Carlos Ponce as yoga instructor hunk Salvatore. Peter Serafinowicz also pleases as Sctanley (yes, it is supposed to be spelled like that).A fairly slight film, but it looks good and amuses.",Couples Retreat
8,anaconda-40658,Great Retreat.,9,15 December 2015,"Couples Retreat (2009): Dir: Peter Billingsley / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Jason Bateman, Faizon Love, Jon Favreau, Malin Akerman: Very funny comedy about friendships but also a celebration of marriage. It is a theme comedy regarding both a vacation paradise as well as the fact that these four couples are growing distant. Thinking that this is a fun outing, these couples are issued skill and communication seminars where true feelings surface. Directed with insight by Peter Billingsley with a screenplay that arrives to the obvious yet detailed in the relationships. Among the cast is Vince Vaughn whose marriage is stable but the seminars bring out certain attitudes. Out of the four couples, it is this one that proves strongest particularly during a test of infidelity. Jason Bateman also stars and encourages his friends along but secrets surface regarding his marriage. Jon Favreau is having problems with his wife because he has infidelity issues that are demonstrated during this vacation. His resolution is the most difficult to buy. Faizon Love is scarred after his wife left him so he arrives with a much younger female who proves irresponsible. They are all matched up with fine female actresses. Malin Akerman stands out because she is not impressed with some of the activities her friends are opened to. A very funny must-see for couples who may relate to the struggle to communicate and fleeing the scene. Score: 9 / 10",Couples Retreat
9,FlashCallahan,Now it's a party........,5,10 February 2010,"So this comedy is about four couples. Three of them are going for a cheap holiday to Bora Bora, the other couple are going to try and salvage their marriage. Hilarity doesn't ensue when they reach the island, and find that all couples have problems in the marriages, and none other than Leon is hosting the island, along with Jango Fett, who does nothing but bang a gong.Thr trailer looked awful, Favreau looks totally out of place in this comedy, and the only people who come out reasonably unscathed are Vaughn and Bateman, who just do what they do in every other film they have been in since 2004.It had such good potential, the premise sounded good, Vaughn and Favreau can be such good writers and have chemistry together on screen, and Bateman does the everyman as good as, well everyman, but it just doesn't work.It tries to hard to please every demographic, and sadly fails on every account.the set pieces are tired, performances feel strained, and the film is very sexist toward the fairer sex.As expected, it all ends happily, but i'm sure the majority of the couples would feel rather bitter toward each other a few years down the line.Reno now must be working foe food, as the roles he has been in lately are dreadful, and to see someone as talented as Serofaniwicz in this, is just a shame.The locales though are beautiful and do sometimes distract from the awful dialogue, but in the end, you will feel cheated.Vaughn is a talented person, but the quality of his movies since dodgeball are decidedly dodgy.",Couples Retreat
10,phd_travel,Painfully inadequate,1,31 July 2010,Vince Vaughan and Jon Favreau are not good enough to write a full length movie comedy. There just aren't enough jokes or a decent enough story to carry this movie. Most of the jokes fall flat. Not even worth a chuckle. Didn't anyone read the script first? The lewd jokes are just lewd not funny.The cast just seems bewildered. Kristen Davis and Kristen Bell are totally wasted. The part with Carlos Ponce is pathetic.Don't bother watching this at all - there are no redeeming features. Not even a pretty set can help. In this day and age it is amazing they can produce such low mentality stuff for audiences.,Couples Retreat
11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Couples Retreat,4,8 December 2009,"I would have expected a riot of a time given what's in the trailers, but what turned out was plenty of bore, with a story that went way off its potential, and allowing mediocrity to barge into the film no thanks to the lacklustre narrative written by Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn and Dana Fox, who all seemed more eager to insert smarty one liners whenever they can, rather than to focus on the predicament of the four couples featured in a paradise island.It's irritating to find that in comedies especially, narratives sometimes get pretty much chopped up due to ad-libbing, NGs, or just for the plain insertion of a funny line that became too difficult to replicate for another shot. Here, this disconnect gets very much pronounced because of how little it tells of one couple's backstory, relying on the audience's memory of what was shown in the trailer to fill in the gap. Call it lazy or slip shoddy presentation, but it was a sign of bad things to come.The couple in question here is Jon Favreau's horny Joey and Kristin Davis' sexually charged Lucy, who have the hots for everyone else but each other, sticking together for the sake of their daughter until she's old enough to move out, then they can separate to support their respective gallivanting ways. Then there's heavyweight Shane (Faizon Love), a divorcée who recently got hooked up with 20 year old Trudy (Kali Hawk). Vince Vaughn's Dave and Malin Akerman's Ronnie seem like the perfect wedded couple with their nice little family, and being the informal leader of the group of friends, and to round things up, Jason Bateman's control freak Jason and wife Cynthia (Kristen Bell) who are on the verge of a breakup due to their inability to conceive, until a foursome package was signed up to bring everyone to Eden West, a paradise island for adult couple therapy.But to get to the island, we got to get through, like the therapy sessions in the film, the boring bits to establish each and every character and key relationships, before a hokey powerpoint presentation and some arm twisting managed to finally shift gears and get the characters to where they should be. Unfortunately though, it only got worse, as the laughs dried up very fast, giving way to some very tedious moments of relationship theories being forced down your throat. I suppose couples whose relationships are on the rocks may benefit from some of the ideas bounced about, but to everyone else, we, like the characters, want to get to the fun parts, fast.Which didn't materialize, and ended up becoming like a series of disparate scenes and incidents being stitched together in a day to day itinerary. One would suspect that plenty of material got saved for a DVD deleted scenes or ultimate uncut version, which makes this theatrical release not so cool, not to mention the final act being totally predictable, and very draggy in getting each couple to their expected resolutions. One also wonders how Jean Reno got himself involved with a dud like this, playing Marcel the founder of the radical therapy programme, if only to build up his resume for not too funny comedic films such as the Pink Panther series.The only truly funniest moment would be the entire yoga sequence with Carlos Ponce as the instructor Salvadore, who comes with chiseled body and a very large package. Filled completely with full on physical sexual innuendos, it's vulgar and crude, yet extremely funny to watch how disgusted and intrigued the different characters felt as his touchy-feely approach. Nothing else stood out, nd Faizon Love faded out for the most of the film once they've reached the resort, leaving the focus firmly on the other three characters. What more, A.R. Rahman was credited to providing the movie music here, but try as hard as I can, I didn't catch anything that was remotely memorable in the soundtrack.Couples Retreat comes with the standard messages of treasuring your loved ones, not taking them for granted and to always continue finding that romantic spark to spice up the relationship, but other than that, it's a tired comedy that has to be injected with cleverer ideas other than the usual frat boy sex jokes.",Couples Retreat
12,namashi_1,Poorly Written...,4,9 February 2010,"Peter Billingsley's 'Couples Retreat' is a poorly written & executed film. Writers Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn & Dana Fox must have been on drugs or high-to write such work. The film doesn't work! Based on 4 couples, who go-for a therapy holiday & finally bond.There's Vince Vaughn & the gorgeous Malin Akerman, Jason Bateman & Kristen Bell & two more. The film starts off very well, but becomes a bore as soon as these characters go for a holiday. The film's climax is so so predictable that you can easily shut or walk out of the film & let your friend enjoy. It's a poor show all the way! Coming to acting, Vince Vaughan is the only one who stands out with a good performance. Jon Favreau tries really hard, but falls flat. Jason Bateman is okay, so is the fat guy. Malin Akerman, Kristen Bell & Kristin Davis have nothing to do. A supremely talented actor like Jean Reno is terribly wasted. What a waste of great talent!! Nothing else to write about this misadventure... Thumbs Down!",Couples Retreat
13,StevePulaski,Laughs come in twos and then stop,4,30 March 2011,"When you watch a comedy film, one that is supposed to be funny, and it's more of a drama, combined with few comedic elements, it sucks. You feel cheated. Couples Retreat is a film stuck in the wrong genre. It states it's a comedy, but doesn't work well as one. This could've been a serious movie, and really should've been considered. But with names like Vince Vaughn, Kristen Bell, and Faizon Love it obviously wouldn't have worked.What we get is a poor comedy stuck in a drama filled plot. It's almost a bad hybrid. The humor is added into make us feel like it's a comedy when it isn't. Almost nothing in the film is funny or worthy of the title ""humor."" Vince Vaughn's quick witted mind is probably the only think that works for this movie. No one else gives their potential.Vince Vaughn and Malin Åkerman play Dave and Ronnie. A couple with two children, a seemingly functional marriage, but it's the classic Husband too busy, Wife wants fun in relationship.Jon Favreau and Kristin Davis play Joey and Lucy. They married early meaning Joey couldn't fool around with younger females and had to fulfill Lucy's needs. They have a teenage daughter going through the ""teenage daughter"" phase. They fight periodically and need some time away.Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell play Jason and Cynthia. Their marriage is possibly the worst of the bunch. They come up with the amazing plan to take their friends to Eden to couple therapy where this mess begins.Faizon Love and Kali Hawk play Shane and Trudy. Shane and Trudy are uncomfortable because of their drastic age difference. Trudy expects a lot from Shane and Shane can only give so much. Halfway through the movie, Trudy goes out to party and take advantage of the idea they are on sort of a ""vacation."" Jason and Cynthia take the other three couples out to Eden, a place where couples enjoy a luxurious paradise but they can't take part in too much of it. They must attend couple therapy in the early morning hours before having their own fun.Couples Retreat is not a comedy. It's a poorly written drama. It packs in a respectable amount of character development and recognizable faces, but overly the screenplay is just lukewarm and general. It runs at 113 minutes which is way too long for a movie like this.It's runtime could be at least fifteen minutes less if some of the dreadfully boring and unfunny therapy scenes were cut out. If the therapy instructor's dialog would've been cleverly written and not just thrown together, idiotic sitcom characters Couples Retreat may have had something going for it. Instead it takes the easy way out of not trying to be memorable or clever. Just cliché.The scenery in Couples Retreat is the best thing the film has going for it next to Vaughn. In the trailers to the film made it look like a CGI island. In the film they actually go to the island which was really a plus. One character, can't remember by name, might have been Jon Favreau, said ""it looks like a screensaver."" It truly does. It's almost too gorgeous.The film is totally not fit for the comedy genre. Being on the verge of divorce isn't funny and is actually a sad topic. With the right writing and a more serious approach Couples Retreat could've retreated us to a more enjoyable and memorable film. Instead we surrender to its simple mindness and unfunny gags.Moral of the story: When you're watching something that is supposed to be funny and it isn't. It's undeniably awkward.Starring: Vince Vaughn, Jason Bateman, Jon Favreau, Faizon Love, Kristen Bell, Malin Åkerman, Kristin Davis, and Kali Hawk. Directed by: Peter Billingsley.",Couples Retreat
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,Had potential but turned out to be nothing special,5,26 October 2009,"After seeing the trailer for Couples Retreat, I wanted to see this movie, I had to see this movie, I also promised Vince Vaughn I would, lol. I met him at a Blackhawk's game a couple weeks prior to seeing this movie and I told him I was excited to see it and he said ""you promise to see it?"", gotta give the man credit for plugging in the movie into our conversation, lol. But even with that, I still wanted to see this movie, it did look honestly funny, but I didn't get to see it until the Monday after it opened originally. I was hearing some bad or okay reviews which disappointed me. But in my opinion, it doesn't matter, it's what you think of the movie, so I still saw it. While the movie wasn't bad, it definitely is something that is forgettable. It just became a typical romantic comedy at the end that really disappointed me. I'll explain why it's a disappointment in a moment.After several failed attempts to conceive, Jason and Cynthia are close to getting a divorce. In an effort to save their marriage they book a vacation to a couples therapy retreat, called Eden. To save money they encourage their friends to join them, and claim that their friends can enjoy the party activities and not take part in the therapy. Their friends, Dave and Ronnie, Joey and Lucy, and recently divorced Shane and his girlfriend Trudy agree. Upon their arrival at Eden, they are sent to the couples resort on the west side of the island, and forbidden from traveling to East Eden, which hosts a singles resort. During their first night, resort host Sctanley informs all four couples that they must all engage in the couples therapy or leave the resort. At their first therapy session, all four couples learn they have problems with their relationships. They endure the resort owner Marcel's unusual methods, including swimming with sharks, naked bonding time, and yoga sessions with amorous instructor.Couples Retreat is worth the watch for a rental when you're looking for a movie night. Because there are a few good laughs herd an there. I was just bummed on how they handled the jokes. Like the shark bite joke, the couples go scuba diving and happened to get a company of sharks, one MAY of took a baby bite out of Vince Vaughn. Now it's funny how he reacts to it, just making it seem like he just got attacked by Jaws. But they carry on the joke for 10 minutes and makes the scene very uncomfortable and instead you just feel like one of the characters who are ready to scream at him ""ok, get over it!"". Also the ending was so predictable and a little too coincidental. One of the guy's ex's just happens to be there because she heard he was going there and wanted to get back together. Of course magically all the couples rekindle their old flames for each other and are happy. Like I said, it's worth the rental, but as for a movie theater experience, you can wait. Sorry Vince, guess I'll have to wait until the next film to see if you still got that comedic gold.5/10",Couples Retreat
15,DKosty123,Bora Bora Marriage Mora Mora Guitar Hero,7,14 February 2010,"I have seen worse films than this one, & I have seen better ones. There is a fair amount of talent in the cast. The locations are great, and there are some amusing moments. The reason it isn't great is because while it has moments, it is not a movie in the classic comedy mode.That being said, there are moments in the film where the acting is pretty good. This script does not give the cast enough to work with but the cast makes the most of what they get. The plot makes sense but is too predictable and even too sanitary but you have to expect that with a PG13 rated film. It would have been more exciting if it had been done as an R Rating because then the film could have taken some real chances.Even the alternate ending on the DVD is pretty dull. This nice thing about the DVD is that some of the gags and out takes are funny and it has a nice feature on Bora Bora. Vince Vaughn & Jason Bateman do a good job and the actresses do a very good job in this movie.While I am glad I didn't see this in other than me home theater, it is an OK film as it does set up properly a plot that makes sense & tries to resolve it. While it is humorous, it is just not hilarious. Young teens who like guitar hero might enjoy the video game sequence.",Couples Retreat
16,sddavis63,Mildly Humorous With A Few Truly Funny Scenes That Leave A Smile On Your Face,6,19 September 2010,"Overall I found this to be an enjoyable movie. There were a lot of mildly amusing scenes, along with a few truly funny ones that got me laughing. The weaknesses, however, were very present and very noticeable, almost from the very first moment. The story, for example, revolves around 4 couples who go on a relationship therapy sort of retreat to a tropical resort. The problem is that three of the couples were guilted into it by the fourth, who were considering splitting up but couldn't afford the trip to try to save their marriage unless they could get the group rate by bringing their friends along - on about a week's notice. That was a bit too contrived for me. I also didn't find the couples especially likable or interesting. Sometimes they grated (such as Joey, played by Jon Favreau, who on this couples retreat was constantly trying to find an excuse to get to the swinging singles resort next door) and they were generally very predictable, with an ending that was ""cute"" perhaps, but not all that interesting. The exception to this was Shane (Faizon Love.) He was an interesting, likable and sympathetic character, recently dumped by his wife, who's trying to regain his pride by taking up with a 20'ish girl named Trudy (Kali Hawk) who accompanies him to the resort. Shane I was rooting for (and there was less predictability in how things would turn out for he and Trudy than for the others.)The real laughs in the movie were provided by the various staff members of the resort. Monsieur Marcel was a sort of new age guru who comes up with this couples therapy idea and Jean Reno was perfectly cast in the part. Peter Serafinowicz was great as Sctanley (""with a C"") and somehow he made even the simplest lines funny - such as ""there's no tipping allowed ... but we do accept smiles."" The real highlight of the movie, though, was the brilliantly over the top yoga instructor Salvador (Carlos Ponce.) I can't imagine that anyone could watch his outrageously sexually charged yoga sessions without bursting into laughter. He was truly the highlight.For a movie with more than a few shortcomings, this does leave you with a smile on your face.",Couples Retreat
17,thesar-2,Just Retreat,2,1 May 2010,"I'm sure I've said this before, but I don't know how they could've made Couples Retreat any less funny. And they had an all star cast, full of comic appeal. But, it seemed more like a ""Rat Pack"" excuse to get everyone together and on a very nice island.Actually, that's probably the only reason the movie was made: everyone got a nice vacation on a beautiful oasis.And it was beautiful. The water, the mountains, the greenery. The enormously fake-CGI sharks, not so much.Unfortunately, the laughs and the weak and predictable plot were made from the same crummy computer that produced the sharks.Four despicable sitcom couples are conned by one of the couples into a therapy journey on a gorgeous and tropical island. Will they or won't they learn to accept and listen to each other? Is anyone serious they can't see how this will pan out? Also, is there any indication of a ""surprise"" or ""twist""? Hardly.In addition to the typical homophobic scenes and almost zero laughs (even the ones that made me half-snicker were so foretold that I was almost bored waiting for them to appear), we have horrible editing and plot holes big enough for the cartoon sharks to swim through. Scenes just start and stop with no rhyme or reason, characters complain of being too tired or beat up but we never learn what made them sluggish and some couples participate in activities while others are off the screen for an extended time and regroup with everyone without an explanation.If it weren't for the beautiful cinematography, I would've fallen asleep at the beginning. It was as if it was a screensaver, so I'm surprised I didn't snooze. (Ironically, the only truthful thing about this mess was a character commenting about the scenery as I just did – it was like a screensaver.) Suffice to say, like the equally brain-dead (though contains a breathtaking island) A Perfect Getaway, you should break up with these couples before your time is wasted. Heck, it was 113 minutes when it should've been 22 for the normal sitcom it replicated. Don't let paradise fool you: SKIP IT.",Couples Retreat
18,MLDinTN,the scenery is the best part,5,13 September 2010,"My main interest in viewing this movie was that it was filmed on location in Bora Bora. Having been to Bora Bora earlier this year, I just wanted to see that beautiful water again. There was one scene in which 2 of the couples are snorkeling and they use computer effects for the reef sharks. Having been there, I know the black tip reef sharks are harmless and easy to find, so I don't get why the director didn't use real sharks for that scene instead of really bad fake ones.Vince Vaughn plays the same character again, a sarcastic guy with a girl that's too hot for him. The movie is about 4 couples whom go to a resort named Eden for couples therapy. Only one couple wants the therapy, but it turns out they all have to complete the course or leave the resort. So of course, the therapy turns out good for all the couples. There is a yoga guy named Salvadore that does some very ""interesting"" yoga exercises with the wives. Somehow, I don't think any guy would be OK with what he does.FINAL VERDICT: Overall, it really isn't a very funny movie and it seems to drag along. The turquoise ocean is the best part, so it's safe to say I don't really think most people will care for this.",Couples Retreat

Once again, Vince Vaughn makes another great movie. I had it with all the bull of people saying Vaughn is the same character every movie. In reality, he's not. I think he's a fine actor.This is about four families who decide to spend a week in paradise at the advice of one of them who is there for legal marriage counseling.All the actors here are pretty funny.

20,inkblot11,"Don't retreat from an invitation to view this film; although not perfect, it has its moments and the cast is a delight",7,17 December 2009,"Dave (Vince Vaughan) and Ronnie (Malin Ackermann) are a typical married couple in the Los Angeles area. They have two darling little boys and, in truth, Dave would rather watch television than go tile shopping with Ronnie. But, they are indeed content, for the most part. Not so for their close friends, Joey (Jon Favreau) and his wife, Lucy (Kristin Davis). They are planning a split as soon as their only child leaves high school, which is just around the corner. They don't talk and they don't kiss. Another friend, Shane (Faizon Love) is newly divorced and hurting. He has hooked up with a pretty young 22-year-old Trudy (Kali Hawk), for solace, and is buying a Harley. One night, still another friend, uptight Jason (Jason Bateman) and his beautiful wife, Cynthia (Kristen Bell) invite the whole gang over for a power-point presentation at their home. They go very reluctantly, for all believe they will be hearing a health presentation on testicular cancer. Instead, Jason and Cynthia drop the bomb that they, too, are having extreme marital difficulties, mostly due to their infertility problems. Thus, Jason delivers a talk on going away for a couples vacation to the South Seas, where they can jet ski between counseling sessions. No one is truly eager to go but Jason strong-arms them into buying tickets. Once there, the island is indeed beautiful. But, wait. The resort is divided into two parts, the ""east side"", where singles dance and party, and the ""west side"" where couples must follow a planned day schedule set up by Marcel (Jean Reno), their temporary love leader. This includes 6 a.m. wake-ups, yoga rituals and long conversations with their counselors. Whew, everyone is ready to give up after the first day. But, can it get better and will every couple stay together, even Joey and Lucy? This film, while not perfect, is entertaining, mostly due to the wonderful cast. Vaughan is a comic genius, while Favreau, Bell, Davis, Ackermann, Love, Hawk, Reno and Bateman are very funny, too. All lesser cast members do a fine job as well. Next, the scenery is exceedingly lovely, making everyone wish they were jetting off to paradise in the next ten minutes. Costumes and all other film niceties are up to snuff, too. Yes, the script by Vaughan and Favreau is uneven but, in reality, has more good lines than bad. The direction is likewise zestful and fun. The only strong criticism that could be given to the flick is that Bell and Ackermann are 10 years younger than the others. Although they are great, were there not a pair of older actresses available that might have been more suitable matches for Vaughan and Bateman? But, this is a slight matter. In short, do not retreat from a showing of this one, all you who love comedy or are fans of the wonderful cast.

It had its funny moments, a few but not throughout the enter film. I enjoyed the beginning and middle of the film. It seemed original then towards the end it became typical, clichéd and the usual. The ending was predictable and became less funny and more romantic. So it starts really with Jason and Cynthia (Bateman and Bell) who are a workaholic couple approaching their marriage as a business, so they propose to their friends a couple-building holiday in a tropical paradise. Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Akerman) need a break form their busy lives, Joey and Lucy (Favreau and Davis) hope to spend as much time holidaying apart as possible, and Shane (Love) brings along his new, young girlfriend (Walsh). Despite the spectacular location, it's not remotely what any of them expect, especially when love guru Marcel (Reno) starts his workshops. There were many funny scenes when they first start at the resort, but one that is most memorable is the yoga scene. Other noticeable scenes were their interview sessions, and the scene where Dave gets attacked by a shark.The storyline/plot was pretty weak and many parts were plain unfunny but others had me laughing (HAHA). Many people touched that since Vaughn and Favreau did so well in Swingers back in 96', they wondered how this would turn out.

26,meeza,More of a trick than a retreat!,6,10 April 2010,"One of the most engaging films I have ever seen is the independent gem ""Swingers"", the 90's cult classic which made a star out of co-star Vince Vaughn and revealed the talent of its star Jon Favreau, who also wrote its classic screenplay. Since ""Swingers"", Vaughn & Favreau have become household names; Vaughn mostly for his trademark quick-gabbing movie characters, and Favreau for his supporting rough-type characters but mostly for pumping the iron in the director's chair for ""Iron Man"" and the upcoming ""Iron Man 2"". Vince and Jon have been good friends throughout the years and have even shared screen time together in movies such as ""The Break-Up"" and ""Four Christmases"". Their on screen buddy chemistry has always been money (through great, good, and mediocre films), even though it will never hit its ""Swingers"" peak. But in the so-called comedy ""Couples Retreat"", Team Favaughn miserably failed their chemistry test. Their good buddy Peter Billingsley directed this dud about four couples who want to better their monotonous relationships by traveling to a tropical island resort for vacation. When they encounter that it is not what was advertised, foreseen chaotic situations occur which lacked originality and ingenuity. Not only that, but the film's screenplay seemed as it was lost in the last resort of clever dialogue, and even that was ""far & few"" in between. I still can't grasp the concept that it was actually Favreau & Vaughn who scribed the film's screenplay. I think it was really some Writing Crashers that kidnapped Jon & Vince's original script and altered it completely. Team Favaughn is much more talented than that! Oh, let me announce the couples' lineup (only cause I have to due to review requirements): Couple #1 is Vince Vaughn & Malin Akerman portraying Dave & Ronnie, the boring couple. Couple #2 is Jason Bateman & Kristen Bell portraying Jason & Cynthia, the infertile couple. Couple #3 is Jon Favreau & Kristin Davis portraying Joey & Lucy, the single-life seeking couple. And Couple #4 is Faizon Love and Kali Hawk portraying Shane & Trudy, the ""huge age difference"" couple. OK, that is enough! I feel like I have been transformed into the body of Bob Eubanks, host of ""The Newlywed Game"". None of these performances by these ""talented actors in other movies"" is worth commending but worth condemning. But they look like Oscar-winning actors compared to the absurd supporting performances of Jean Reno as Marcel the couples' guru, and Carlos Ponce as Salvadore the yoga instructor; these couple of clowns should have retreated out of the picture from ""Couples Retreat"". But back to Team Favaughn, hope is not lost my friends. You guys are still money in my book. But please no more ""Couples Retreats"", or else I will separate myself from your future projects. Not a single or married person can take that cinematic pain again! Amen! ** Needs Improvement",Couples Retreat
27,estebangonzalez10,Another talented cast is wasted by a terrible script,3,28 July 2010,"¨Do you have a phone? I need to call God and tell Him that one of His angels is missing. ¨ If you never heard that line before then perhaps you will enjoy this movie which consists of familiar jokes and few laughs and several cheesy dialogues. This movie was really hard to sit through and looked much better in the trailers than it actually was. The cast is an interesting one, but the material they had to work with was very poor. Vince Vaughn teamed up with Iron Man director Jon Favreau and Dana Fox to write the screenplay for this film, and all I can say is that they should stick to directing and acting based on this material. Who shouldn't stick with directing is Peter Billingsley who really couldn't prove himself in this his first feature film. He has produced several of Vaughn's and Favreau's movies in the past such as Iron Man, Zathura, The Break Up, and Four Christmases, so he is familiar with them. Billingsley is mostly known for his role as little Ralphie from A Christmas Story. In this movie it seems as though the actors just found an excuse to get together and have a good time because no effort was put whatsoever in trying to improve the film. The movie was full of clichés and really bad jokes, and even with my low expectations I was disappointed with this film. It seems as if lately many films with a talented cast aren't really interested in making a good movie, they just want to have a good time and have fun together (Grown Ups was another example). They might have had fun working together, but for the viewers these films are a huge mess.A group of friends are convinced of going to a couple's retreat in a paradisiacal island because Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) are having marital issues and want to find a solution to their problems. The other three couples consist of Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman), Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis), and Shane (Faizon Love), who has recently divorced his wife Jennifer (Tasha Smith) and is dating a twenty year old named Trudy (Kali Hawk). The four couples travel together to the resort named Eden hoping to have a good time while Jason and Cynthia receive counseling. To their surprise each couple is forced to participate in the counseling sessions. There is no time for fun and the activities begin at 6 am with sessions with Marcel (Jean Reno), the man responsible for the couple's therapy. There are actually two sides to the resort, one in the west for singles who have fun and party all the time, while the one in the east is for couples who are trying to work things out and that is where they must remain even though the rest of the couples don't think they have marital issues. These counseling sessions bring problems even for the couple's who seemed to be fine. Each couple has a therapist, played by John Higgins, Ken Jeong, Charlotte Cornwell, and Amy Hill. They also have a yoga instructor who like to wear as little clothes as possible, Salvatore (Carlos Ponce), who doesn't consider personal space. All of a sudden the tropical island doesn't seem to have been a good idea for any of them.This movie relies heavily on cheap jokes that we have all been familiar with in the past and the film really doesn't work as a comedy. The actors are wasted because the material they had to work with was just terrible. Vince Vaughn was probably the funniest in the movie, but I was really disappointed with the screenplay which he helped write. Jon Favreau has directed some good films as well, but in this movie he just seemed to have his mind on resting and having a good time before continuing to focus on the Iron Man sequel. The supporting cast couldn't do much to save the movie either. Jean Reno is a funny man, but in this film he had nothing fresh to bring to the table. The same thing can be said about Ken Jeong who was extremely funny in The Hangover and Role Models, but in this movie he simply goes by unnoticed. This is a comedy you should stay away from, don't let yourself be fooled by the trailers because there is nothing funny about this film. The movie just drags for a long time and is extremely long for a comedy. Skip this movie! http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Couples Retreat

Despite all these obvious advantages, Couples Retreat ended up being a bland and unimpressive comedy.The main problem was the script, which was very weak. Lots of the jokes fall flat, and the characters weren't well-written at all. It's a shame that these actors were wasted this way, because I'm convinced that with a better script, they all could have shined. Vince Vaughn, Faizon Love, and Carlos Ponce (in a small but hilarious role) are really the only three actors that get any laughs, but they seem to do it in spite of the script, instead of because of it.  If you want to see a funny relationship comedy that's set in a spectacularly beautiful place, I strongly recommend that you check out the far superior Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

A little bit of Survivor TV show, The Bachelor TV show, Big Brother TV show, and the Dr. Phil TV show. And, this is billed as a comedy. Give me a break. The promos did me in again. I will never learn. The first 10-minutes are good and we anticipated a good time when all the couples go to the island. Then the TV shows mentioned above chimed in. The couples are set up in structured classes (that they didn't know about) and some are embarrassing to watch, especially what passes for Yoga lessons. They are actually sexual exercises positions presented rather crudely, I thought. They only served to titillate the 7th and 8th graders who got in when no one was looking. We see Jean Reno in here. Yes, he is the Frenchman who is in all those hit-man and espionage movies. I was kind of hoping he did some of those things at this paradise. Didn't happen. Pity. He had a guru role for the couples. You could tell he was nervous as I saw his hands twitching like they missed holding a Glock or sniper rifle. The only stand-out was Peter Serafinowicz as Sctanley (pronounced Stanley) as he played the Mr. Roarke role (from Fantasy Island TV show) with that deep commanding voice. Good job. No good one-liners, no physical comedy to relate. Vince Vaughn had a hand in writing and producing this so you know where to look if you don't have a good time. Okay, it was mostly Dr Phil throughout as each couple was set up with a psycho analyst and that would have been okay, but nothing funny happened. If you watch an actual Dr. Phil show, you will hear some good one-liners from time to time. Hey, I used to channel check. One would think the writer of this movie, whoever it was (V.

34,Troy_Campbell,DVD bargain bins beckon,4,7 October 2009,"I'm unsure what is more worrying, that Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau starred in such a mediocre comedy or the fact that they wrote it. Good friends and regular collaborators Vaughn and Favreau have had mixed results in their working partnership: Swingers is a bona-fide cult classic which tore up the indie circuit back in 1996; Made was a disappointment to all those expecting Swingers 2; The Break-Up was a successful guilty pleasure and Four Holidays (Four Christmases in the US) flopped massively at the US box-office. Where does Retreat fit in? Somewhere near Four Holidays – but at least they didn't also write that.The target audience was obviously never decided upon as the humour seems to cater for everyone. One minute there are mature, real life moments that firmly fit into the ""funny because it's true"" category, the next there are gags revolving around untimely erections and masturbation that would be right at home in American Pie. Done in the right way and on their own either of these forms of comedy can be brilliant, however mixing them together makes for a muddled experience. There are a few hilarious scenes – the yoga session undoubtedly the most memorable – just nowhere near enough.Of the cast Vaughn and Akerman come out best, their natural chemistry and adroit comic timing going a long way to keeping the movie afloat. The others don't fare so well. Favreau needs to leave the acting business and focus on writing and directing, it is practically impossible for him to be amusing on screen. Bateman, Bell, Davis and Love all fail to ever get us laughing, whilst the extended cameo from Jean Reno is possibly the worst stuff the experienced Frenchman has ever put on celluloid.If you are looking for an easy comedy with fabulous locations (and women) then this might do the trick, but I definitely could not recommend spending your had earned cash to see this at the cinema.

35,dunmore_ego,Club Med(iocre),5,29 August 2010,"""Holy **** - this looks like a screen saver!"" That's the funniest laugh-out-loud line in COUPLES RETREAT, delivered by Jon Favreau when the cast arrive at their paradise resort - but it also describes the energy level of this dull excursion into the high maintenance of couple hood.Three couples (Vince Vaughn and Malin Akerman, Jon Favreau and SEX AND THE CITY's Kristin Davis, and Faizon Love and Kali Hawk) are cajoled into attending a bargain-rate couples retreat by couple-in-distress Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell.Though their getaway promises raging activities and paradisaic locations, the brochure doesn't mention that counseling is mandatory. So now we too have to sit through couples counseling (which could have been worthwhile, considering Ken Jeong and John Michael Higgins were two counselors, but whose funniest bits were all transferred to the Deleted Scenes). And even those couples who don't need advice are driven further apart through miscommunication and counselor psycho jargon. I'm sure the feeling of nothingness we ended up with after these sessions was not the filmmakers' original intention.Jean Reno is head guru, overqualified to be in this demeaning role, and Temuera Morrison is also sadly miscast here as a guy who simply bangs a gong - literally. Honorable mention to Carlos Ponce as a yoga instructor who gets away with dry humping the wide-thighed ladies in full ankle-behind-ear positions, with more suggestiveness than is usually allowed in PG-13 bore-fests. But I guess all the MPAA censors were asleep by now and didn't even witness this scene. ""Boom..."" Film loses us completely when the cast have to disrobe and these women who are reputedly 9s and 10s pretend with all their acting ability (which isn't much) that they're embarrassed for being ""out of shape."" Shyeh royt! The selling point of this movie is the perfection of Malin Akerman's and Kristen Bell's flat bellies, from which every man in the audience fantasizes eating strawberries and licking the whipped cream off. Both of them supposedly have two kids each, yet not a vestigial stretch mark between them. Who are they kidding with the fake self-effacing? I don't even get this scene: Why are any of these in-shape people so shy about getting down to their bikinis on a freakin' beach?! (Faizon is admittedly a fatty, but the gag is that he's wearing no undies. Coincidence then, that at the exact point the filmmakers stoop to pulling down a fat man's pants with an undesired angle on his cream-cheesed buttocks, the film gets lost up its own backside...) Nice to see Favreau in another meaty role with Vaughn, both shooting their mouths at each other, with Bateman smarming his lines in sideways. Funniest scene is undoubtedly Favreau's masturbation interruptus - just the way he pulled the front of his t-shirt over the back of his head will kill men who have done the same thing out of sheer bone laziness (or should that be 'boner-laziness'?).When a perfect 9 tries to be funny about anything, the absolute last thing I'm thinking about is how well she's delivering the joke. That's the problem with COUPLES RETREAT - too many sexy chicks trying to deliver jokes - which is simultaneously the draw-card for its wanky audience. Men can innocently claim being dragged to this movie by their girlfriends and then have a nice tittygawk at the 8s, 9s and 10s that populate the female roles and extras in bikinis.After nothing continues to happen past the point of us caring whether anything is ever going to happen, everyone reconciles with their spouses.

And this is one miserable failure. Eight friends, four couples, end up at a tropical couples therapy resort. Hilarity does not ensue. There is a tiny hint of promise in the opening scenes as the story sets itself up, with one of the couples badgering the rest of their friends to go on the trip. But once we get to the resort the movie completely falls apart. Over the final 90 minutes nothing funny happens. Literally nothing. Some of the failed attempts at humor are so bad they are cringe-inducing. It is uncomfortable to watch. The film is desperate for laughs, it tries anything and everything and none of it works. Absolutely excruciating. Vince Vaughn seems incredibly bored. Jon Favreau plays a character who is a thoroughly detestable boor. Favreau was actually the lead writer of this mess of a movie, why did he write himself such a miserable character? The nicest thing you can say about anyone involved in the movie is that Jason Bateman and Faizon Love are reasonably decent. The women in the movie are completely wasted, there is nothing memorable or interesting about any of their characters. The supporting cast, headed by Jean Reno, gets no laughs. Not even a chuckle.

38,tbills2,Couples Retreat is a Couples Real Treat,6,26 October 2018,"Dear Vincent Vaughn... who apparently helped write this pleasant couples' treat for all ages, nice going friend. I'm really not too sure why the movie doesn't just start AT THE ISLAND. All the character introductions in the beginning establishing the backgrounds and personalities of each character before they get to the ISLAND were so critical to the heart of ALL the characters' developments that I'm fairly certain, moreso even, I'm extremely confident and positive that it would have been next to impossible to develop the characters WHILE AT THE ISLAND or muster up any ideas whatsoever as to how to create a character-to-audience involved and evolving relationship with the viewers WHILE AT THE ISLAND and I definitely wouldn't just TOTALLY ELIMINATE the first 20 plus minutes of this movie for the sake of all humanity because I really would have been totally lost if not for all the blessedly composed character backgrounds in the beginning. The beginning of this movie sucks so bad that I'm deeply imploring all watchers or potential watchers to use your fast forwarding devices to skip forward to when they actually GET TO THE ISLAND because when all the characters GET TO THE ISLAND this movie's really good. It's really considerably messed up how very bad the beginning of this movie ('whale tusks', 'asstastic', 'If we do get divorced, it will take at least six months to go through the five stages of grief, for the sake of argument...'), Couples Retreat, is compared to the rest of it which takes place at the island.

39,MattyGibbs,"Well written, well acted and very enjoyable",7,22 July 2013,I must admit to being a fan of Vince Vaughan. I'm pretty sure he has no pretensions of being a great actor and he always seems to play the same character but it's a likable and charming character nonetheless. This is a film for 30 something plus couples to watch and enjoy. It's not a film that will particularly appeal to a younger audience or the kind of guy that thinks the only good film has to include some kind of superhero. For the silent majority however this is a very entertaining and watchable film with plenty of laughs throughout. Yes you know how it will end but the fun is watching the characters get there. Of the people I know who watched this all have enjoyed it which makes a rating of 5.4 even more laughable. The vast majority of voters on here are men however and therefore any film not totally aimed at male testosterone is always going to be unfairly rated on here. Just note that this film made a large profit and rightly so.The cast is first rate and there are no weak performances. They all seemed to be having a good time and that shone through in their performances. This is an excellent comedy and if you like Vince Vaughan i'm pretty sure you'll like this.,Couples Retreat
40,DonFishies,"Hilarious at times, but never really strives to be more than average",7,7 October 2009,"Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) are dangerously close to getting a divorce. In a last ditch effort to save their marriage, they decide to take a vacation to a tropical resort meant to help ailing couples through therapy. Short on cash, they enlist help from their friends to offset the cost through a group rate: the kid-raising Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman), the lovelessly married Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristen Davis), and the recently divorced Shane (Faizon Love) and his much younger girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk). The three other couples think they are just going to have fun and help their friends, but they realize they are in for having their relationships examined as well.Couples Retreat is not a bad film by any means, but it never seems to strive to be a great one either. It seems perfectly content at being average; a harmless diversion not meant to really do much outside of mildly entertain the audience.Leaving aside some rather obvious and unexplained age issues between the couples, the film does not throw any punches with its storyline. It never wavers from its basic premise, and stays on a fairly straight and predictable path. Subplots involving the resort's employees materialize and disappear just as fast. And while it does not necessarily drag at any real moments, there are more than a few instances where some scenes are emphasized much longer than others that probably could have done with more emphasis. By the time the film's ending hits, it feels abrupt and almost like a missed opportunity for more gags and characterization that could have only benefited everyone involved. The film does do a great job of blasting through basic backstories for everyone involved within the opening ten minutes, but does not do nearly enough of a job convincing us of the evolution they go through while on vacation.While some will find this film to be hilarious from beginning to end, I cannot help but wonder how much funnier it really could have been. Yes, there are some hilarious moments sprinkled throughout the film, and some moments that are merely humorous, but there are a ton of awkward and juvenile moments that easily could have been done away with. From the start, the film sets itself up as skewing towards an older crowd, but then relies on gross out and absurd moments (specifically involving Favreau, who co-wrote the script and presumably picked his own part) that belong in a direct-to-video sequel to American Pie. These moments really took me out of the film, and just begged the question why they even bothered placing them in here at all. Worse yet, there are more than a handful of moments that simply are not funny at all, no matter how forced the actors make them.What I really enjoyed however, as I did with the far superior Forgetting Sarah Marshall, was how it dealt with the very real trauma of a disintegrating relationship. Couples Retreat takes the high road by loading the film with comic imagery and dialogue to offset the devastating and bitter arguments. They never shy away from hiding the truth of the pain and hurt feelings these characters go through, but they tend to not over accentuate these moments for the sake of staying within the realm of comedy. I can appreciate that, because at the end of the day, everyone wants to be entertained at the movies, and watching characters yell and put each other down in a comedy is not anyone's definition of a comedy (although a well made drama like Revolutionary Road can pull it off). I only mention this because of The Break-Up, a supposed comedy about a couple's breakup. The film, again starring Vaughn and Favreau, was just horrifically disappointing and near pathetic in its attempts at entertaining an audience. A mess of ideas and ill-placed and near non-existent humour made that film almost unwatchable. But in Couples Retreat, the drama and the comedy are balanced so easily that it makes one question how a movie like The Break-Up could have failed on so many counts.The acting is not extraordinary, but it is fairly well done. The men seem to do a lot better than the women in all cases (likely because of how much more seems to be written for them), but then three of the four main male actors have spent much of the past decade working in comedy. The comical repairing of Vaughn and Favreau does wonders for the film, making it all the more watchable. Favreau puts in some really great work as a man just counting down the days until he and his wife file for divorce. While he is saddled with the worst scenes in the film, he delivers the strongest and most consistent work. Vaughn plays the resentful know-it-all character he has been perfecting for years now, but he is more muted here than he is in the likes of Wedding Crashers. Bateman does good in his role, but he never really stretches his character out at any moment. Love shows hints of really making something of his character, but never manages to move outside of being the obvious comic fodder.Of the female characters, I really enjoyed Bell's performance the best. Hawk never really gets a chance to do much of anything, Davis seems too old for her character (and a bit too close to her role in Sex and the City), and Akerman just never really impresses. I liked her better in Watchmen, and she was one of the weakest things about that movie.Far from perfect, Couples Retreat is a decent film that never strives to be more than average. It has quite a few laughs, and some respectably dramatic scenes. If you go in not expecting much, you will not come out disappointed.7/10.",Couples Retreat

42,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10),5,21 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...The movie is centered around 4 couples who are experiencing troubles on one level or another and decide to spend a week on a paradise island that specializes in couple's therapy. They want to live it up and have some fun, but instead are required to stick to a strict schedule - working on and communicating their problems. As the story develops, each couple is forced to face things head on, whether they realize these problems or not. Finally, each marriage comes to a resolution.Well, this wasn't exactly an impressive movie, even the comedy in places falls flat. For them to work out all of their problems after only one week is unrealistic. I did like some of the sets, the oceanic scenery was beautiful - the strength of the movie was its cinematography. That clear, blue water made you want to be there too. The reason this film isn't a complete fail for me was there were a couple of scenes that I did enjoy. The Guitar Hero stand-off was fun to watch.None of the couples exhibited any chemistry, and there wasn't any good acting to speak of. This isn't a recommend, but you could do a lot worse. It's worth a watch - one of those late night type of movies where you won't care if you fall asleep in the middle of it or not. Generic film - nothing special.",Couples Retreat

I quite like Vince, but the only problem is he has no range. All of his roles are the same. He can't change his personality. The movie also stars Jason Bateman, Faizon Love & Jon Favreau. They all did good jobs. I thought they were quite good. The ladies also did good jobs. Malin Akerman, Kristen Bell, Kristin Davis & Kali Hawk. But I have to say my favourite character in the movie was Salvadore, played by Carlos Ponce. He was by far the funniest character in the movie. His yoga class was really funny.The film was entertaining, but the problem is, it wasn't that funny. For a comedy, there was only 1 laugh out loud moment.

45,diac228,70 million dollars couldn't get you real sharks?,6,27 October 2009,"Couples Retreat is one of those fluffy romantic comedies that feature a (mostly) attractive cast, attractive setting, many attempts at crazy humor, and an overall romantic tone that allows for you and your date to cuddle with glee. In other words, Couples Retreat is an island-getaway/multiple storyline version of The Proposal. But, unlike the Proposal, this film can never quite get over the mediocrity hump. The good news is that the cast chemistry allows for the film to stay afloat, and take care of some of the blemishes that occur. This movie is about four couples that decide to take a vacation for a week, to take advantage of a money-saving deal. However, none of the couples expected to find that therapy was not only offered in the paradise, but it was actually required. There's the new couple (Faizon Love, Kali Hawk), the cheating couple (Jon Favreau, Kristen Davis), the non-communicative couple (Malin Akerman, Vince Vaughan), and the seemingly-happy couple that's secretly on the edge (Jason Bateman, Kristin Bell). All four couples throughout the movie start clashing amongst themselves and ultimately against each other as the weaknesses and issues of all four relationships begin to unravel. The main draw of Couples Retreat was that the writing came from the Swingers duo, Vince Vaughan and Jon Favreau. Unfortunately, because of the PG-13 rating, their writing had to be scaled back in terms of content and realism. Usually the best romantic comedies are those that don't mind the R-rating (40-Year-Old Virgin, Pretty Woman, When Harry Met Sally) and we can only ponder how much better the writing would have been if they hadn't focused on the rating. Instead, we have few moments of clever memorable lines, and fewer pick-up lines to copy and use on the opposite sex (you know there's people out there that steal their material from films). The couples themselves had a decent amount of chemistry, with the best couple being Akerman and Vaughan. The women however seem to be in the movie mostly for the eye candy, as they had little material to work with. Final note: its amazing that at age 44, Kristin Davis can still look just as good as the younglings Akerman, Bell, and Hawk. Peter Billingsley (Ralphie from the Christmas masterpiece A Christmas Story) is behind the director's chair in this project. With limited directing experience, he doesn't really contribute much magic aside from the beautiful scenery (Bora Bora looks spectacular). He only toys with the camera during an out-of-left-field Guitar Hero sequence that blends with spaghetti western references. He doesn't have much comedic timing, so he relies on the cast to deliver the goods. Like most comedies nowadays, it's the star power that's required to carry the movie, not how the director attempts to enhance the script. The entire film is very hit-and-miss, and with nearly two hours under its belt you will have your share of hilarious moments, but then you'll have moments of embarrassingly lame scenes. Then there are sometimes the problems are deep and complex, but the results and resolutions become a bit on the shallow side. Couples Retreat isn't a disaster, but isn't anything incredible either. In a year full of surprise-surprise romantic comedies (He's Just Not That Into You, The Proposal, (500) Days of Summer, The Ugly Truth) this movie suffers from dealing with the sudden overwhelming competition, and from never being able to rise from mediocrity and run-of-the-mill material. Bottom Line: Couples Retreat is a retread of your typical romantic comedy flare, which would have been fine except 2009 has been chock full of success romantic stories. With one blockbuster hit, two that made back its budget instantly, and one that may even be a Best Picture nominee, this movie had some serious shoes to fill. The large ensemble cast keeps the movie afloat, while the lack of effort from the directing and the watered-down writing prevents it from being something big. The movie isn't very moving, nor is it very fulfilling. Nonetheless, you'll have your laughs, you'll have your eye candy, and it isn't the worst movie (or romantic comedy) this year.",Couples Retreat
46,barrys82,It really worked for me,7,29 December 2009,"Couples Retreat is a comedy centered around four couples who settle into a tropical-island resort for a vacation. While one of the couples is there to work on the marriage, the others fail to realize that participation in the resort's therapy sessions is not optional. Couples Retreat is like a romantic comedy but without all the romantic stuff, well maybe a little bit of romance at the end but that's it. It has many funny moments. The locations are wonderful all the landscapes are fantastic. The cast is really good, Vince Vaughn still got the necessary to make people laugh, Jon Favreau is also very funny in this movie. Kristen Bell, Kristin Davis and Malin Akerman all three with very decent performances and the one that steals the show is Latin actor Carlos Ponce with his performance of yoga instructor, he was hilarious. To conclude, Couples Retreat is a movie with the only purpose of entertaining, and I think it accomplishes it very nice.",Couples Retreat

48,mrcibubur,"If this was a comedy, don't make me laugh!",3,12 January 2010,"this almost without doubt is the worst film I have seen in a while. I struggled to watch it to its conclusion. No comedy for me, no laughs, just a bunch of affluent American couples who all have relationship difficulties (who doesn't?) and there are appointed holiday therapists to help the couples along through their difficulties, even though they didn't think they had any difficulties. The fitness instructor guy was absolute ace in my opinion and that was the best bit of the film, the rest of it you can truly scrap. live and let lived but not with this one. Loosen up America, the rest of the world does not want your garbage and this is pure garbage and nobody in their right mind, warned in advance what they might see, will go and see this movie.

49,moviedude1,"Was it just me, or did it feel like all the actors were just going through the motions?",3,3 October 2010,"To be totally honest, I never was a really big fan of Vince Vaughn, but I guess he's an ""all-right guy."" But I would only put that title on his ability to act, because he sure fell short in his ability to write comedy. Given the setting that he and his fellow writers put themselves in, the plot fell way short of spectacular and ended up somewhere between boring and snoring (I really did almost fall asleep during this film).But given the lead having called in his part (the film might have been better if he HAD called it in), I can get a better understanding of how an actor can ""play"" off another actor, which the rest of the cast accomplished in doing. Bottom line: in this film, Vince Vaughn pulled out all the stops in achieving NOTHING! 3 out of 10 stars in this film is a gift!",Couples Retreat
50,Siamois,Couples Retreat offers a couple of laughs,4,19 January 2010,"I was looking forward to this film. An all-star cast, the Vaughn-Favreau duo both as actors and writers... plus what looked like a paradisiac resort setting!Indeed, the actors are doing great but the characters seem to have been neglected. Favreau and Vaughn keep all the better gags for themselves. Vaughn gets all the good lines and the script seems oriented for his style of humor, while Favreau gets an hilarious scene where he wants to ""play with himself"" and gets caught by a resort employee. But on average, the laughs are few. This comedy alternates between light irreverence (guys being guys, girls being girls) and romantic (each of the couples have their own issues which they work on). Unfortunately, the irreverence doesn't lead to laughs and the romantic side is terribly easy, with every issue ""miraculously fixed"" at the movie's climax. It all feels very artificial. Speaking of artificial, the sets are terribly under exploited. Someone like Danny Boyle could draw you in a paradise with sounds and sights (The Beach 2000) but director Peter Billingsley neglects this aspect. It looks like a backdrop and an afterthought for most scenes. So we don't feel this universe the characters are in. The resort staff is extremely caricatural. The incisive humor that used to be the trademark of the Favreau/Vaughn duo is nowhere to be seen. What you're left with is four average middle-aged guys with four smoking women and a forgettable plot with the usual happy ending.",Couples Retreat
51,headly66,Avoid at all cost.....,1,27 December 2009,"I knew I was in for a treat when I got at least 2 pee and 5 ball sack jokes in the first ten minutes of this trite excursion into dullsville. Everyone here plays exactly what you would expect of them, basically themselves in real life. This must have taken very little time to make and seems to just be a paycheck for the actors. The plot is ridiculously contrived, a couple is having troubles so to reassess their lives they want to go to a beautiful retreat but can't afford it even though they seem rich so they force their friends to go also on a weeks notice. The club is said to be so hard to get into but for some reason they offer half price for 4 couples, which makes a lot of sense. Their only black friend who seems completely out of place here (and not because he's black) has no money but who is buying a motorcycle somehow, can also go with his 20 year old love tart whom everyone has no problem with joining them even though she obviously only cares that he buys her things but agrees to go through couples counseling even though they just met.Once on the island they are now informed they have to do what the retreat has planed for them and are again told there is a very long waiting list, but they again got a 1/2 price deal just for being them.The next painful hour is spent creating one ridiculous scenario after another like when they all have to undress and all the other men are allowed to keep their underwear on except the guy with pants has to go naked in front of his friends wives.This is one of the silliest pieces of junk to come along in a while.",Couples Retreat
52,Bravesfan17,"Not that bad, but still enjoyable",7,8 June 2010,"Vince Vaughn has been known to play funny characters who are similar to each other, such as Wedding Crashers, Dodgeball, and Old School. He repeats that here in Couples Retreat, a comedy about him and three of his buddies (Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, and Faizon Love), who go with their wives/girlfriends to a resort to work on their marital problems.While Vaughn repeats this character, he is still funny bringing the fast talk. Favreau and Bateman do decent enough jobs acting in their parts, as Vaughn and Favreau also wrote the screenplay for this movie. The wives (Malin Akerman, Kristin Davis, and Kristen Bell) all do fine jobs as well. No one performance is better than any of the others. They all do a fine job and have enough funny lines. Jean Reno plays the main therapist at the retreat and steals a couple of scenes.Most of the humor comes from the situations that these characters go through in going to therapy, and not getting to have a lot of fun. Director Peter Billingsley does a fine job directing. He lets the actors work their dialogue and humor into the scene, but some scenes feel forced more than others.It is still a funny, laugh out loud movie that is worth renting. It isn't the best from Billingsley, Vaughn, or any of the rest of the cast, but it is still an entertaining comedy. If you're looking for a couple hours of fun, this is a movie worth checking out at least once.",Couples Retreat

Solid and realistic acting from its highly talented cast - Jason Bateman (Nick Wilde in Zootopia), Kristen Bell (Anna from Frozen), Jon Fravreau (do I even need to remind anyone who he is?), Vince Vaughn, etc., etc. (Even John Michael Higgins).
The plot MIGHT be a bit thin, but hey! It's a comedy. Again, not a serious drama that needs a solid, well-built plot. But everything goes the way it should - even with a few bumps and crude stuff a long the way for the characters.

I can tell you that the film is NOT a Romantic Comedy, as it's not funny. There are a few desultory laughs, but the story concerns the relationship problems of four couples.They go to a Couple's Island for a week at the behest of the character played by Jason Bateman, who claims he & his pretty wife are on the verge of a breakup. They need a group rate--hence, all 3 other couples are required. Only Vince Vaughan & his wife (played by Malin Akerman) seem to have a decent marriage, but Vince can be bossy and whiny at times--so, what should be a great week for them in the tropics falls flat also, under the persistent probing of the 'counselors' at the Resort. What's so funny about that?Vaughan had a hand in the script. Here's a question: what humourous components, Vince, did you think you had with this mess? Couples who can't get along, or flirt with other 'attractive' people are NOT funny. Sometimes, the characters seem to move forward, but then quickly regress back to 'I dunno'. That is neither plot or character development. Why not just write a happy story where everyone reconnects after some light slapstick events?I can't spoil the ending, because I jumped ship.

Small films are good, even smaller Hollywood films keep the Spielbergs honest, but Vaughan et al have substantial names and budgets and Hollywood lifestyles that don't justify them turning out comedies they wrote (and in this case, acted) in their sleep.

On second thought, I don't even want to go there. The movie keeps jerking you here and there like you're a ball on an elastic. Jason (Jason Bateman) misleads the other couples by saying therapy is optional at the retreat because he can't afford the trip by himself. But it's mandatory. From what we know of the characters so far, most would want a refund since none are the soul-searching type. Whatever they paid, a refund seems the most likely solution. (They can sue later for the airline fares.) But instead the other couples give in with little protest which strained credibility for me. What then, is their motivation now? Joey (Favreau) just wants to get off; Shane (Faison Love) wants to pretend he's young and also avoid the pain of his divorce; Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Akerman) go along because they're good sports. and Jason (Bateman) wants to control his wife. Are there some laughs here? Can we laugh if we OVERLOOK the inconsistencies? I did but only a little. Stanley the yoga teacher made me laugh even though he was very non yogi-like. The therapists were funny because they were right at times and then too aggressive and revealing at others. That wasn't so funny. And when they start ""Operation Eden East"" the movie dies a slow death. Favreau just wants to get off with strange stuff and this motivates the whole party to follow along. Even if they find Trudy (Hawk) it's unlikely she'll return with them. She's an adult. Eden East is a fake temptation that they all drift towards so the audience can buy into the rapprochements at the end. (Oh those lost and immature single people.) The utmost in unbelievability was the surprise entrance of Faison's ex-wife. Nothing in the story laid any grounds for that surprise. Wouldn't Faison have known if she were even slightly ambivalent about the divorce? Someone writing the ending wanted to sew up every couple relationship no matter how unlikely it might fit the story as told so far. Joey's makeup with Shane was also totally unbelievable. There was no groundwork for it. They hadn't so much as smiled at each other throughout the whole movie. I was really enjoying Cynthia's new freedom from control freak Jason until she caved in and gave him another chance. She needed to test his promise to change for about six months first. Instead she bought the farm after five minutes. Believable and fun was the makeup between Vaugh and Akerman. They realized that they'd always been OK. But I'd seen too much BS by then. One more thing: when you bang a gong you need to remove the hammer or it will prevent the gong from vibrating. The way it was in the film (leaving the hammer against the brass) would have produced a big thud. Like the movie, in fact",Couples Retreat
64,Jules45,I thought comedies were supposed to be funny?,2,21 July 2010,"When watching a bad film your mind tends to trail away to things you have completely forgotten about; for example Ron Burgundy was singing 'Afternoon Delight' in my noggin after some painfully mundane minutes of this dross. The fact that I got from Couples Retreat to Ron Burgundy singing so quickly should really inspire enough of a warning to stay clear.Borderline divorcée couple Jason and Cynthia persuade their six other relationship unhappy friends to take a vacation with them to paradise, yet things aren't as relaxing or helpful for their marriage as they hoped. That is what I was expecting before watching the film, but I found a more realistic rephrase of this to be: Four couples, three clueless script writers, too few jokes, one tropical island and zero enjoyment.While at the island the couples learn about their inner animal spirit; personally mine felt like a fish made to watch a seafood cooking show, I felt that disgusted from watching. The whole film feels like Forgetting Sarah Marshall without the humour plus some bad acting which equals a much needed warning label from Lemony Snicket on the back cover.Jason (coincidentally played by Jason, which is about as imaginative as the script goes) is so clueless with women there was easily enough leg room for humour, however sadly it just left me feeling like Casanova – which is saying something, rather than in fits of giggles like a comedy should. Equally missed opportunities are shared by the cast which even the cleavage and scarcely clad women can't compensate for.I'm happy to give credit to films where it is due, but I genuinely can't think of a single reason to watch Couples Retreat other than Kristen Bell in a bikini. Good news though, there is never darkness without light and the light here simply is at least the Razzie's won't need to search too far to find a film that could fit plenty of nominations.",Couples Retreat

This island hosts a program called the EDEN program which promises married couples to rebind the bond in their relationship. Jason and his wife need this break to pick up the flare in their lives. They bring along their friends as this program offers a discount if its a set of 4 couples! After getting there they find out it is not just going to be fun and games with their partner but a series of relationship building activities these couples need to undertake. The other couples find this hard as they dint sign up for this. Rest of the movie has quite a decent amount of funny moments(EXPLICIT HUMOUR WARNING). The islands look awesome and some scenes look really gorgeous in high definition. Decent soundtrack. But the sad part is its just another forgettable movie and movie ain't doesn't tread in any unknown paths.

67,nuhc,About as fun as real couples' therapy,2,20 July 2010,"The title pretty much says it all. This movie is a very lackluster comedy, if you could even call it a comedy. It did have a couple of somewhat funny moments, but the entire time I was sitting there waiting for the movie to get good, only to be disappointed. There aren't even any boob shots in the movie which would have helped it out a bit, but I guess Ralphie the director didn't want anything dirty to spoil the film. All you get is a half-butt shot of a large black man which really doesn't help the lack of comedy much.As I said in the summary, the scenes where the couples are having sessions with the therapist were about as fun as actually being in couple's therapy. They could have been either written funnier or left out completely. And the yoga scene, which was apparently intended to be hilarious, just seemed to fall flat.All in all I'd recommend not watching this movie.

The characters were not likable and they had no depth. The relationships were undeveloped and thus unbelievable. We were just supposed to accept them. The story was inane. The acting was unprofessional, but that may well have been because of horrid direction. This thing fails miserably as a comedy, except for the few dramatic attempts, which were funny.Might have been a good excuse for a bunch of people to go off to a tropical island and pretend to do work.

It wasn't horrible, it wasn't that bad, it wasn't very good. I think you can tell what I mean. Some movies are just so horrible that they can easily be rated a 1, 2, or maybe 3. Some are so good they are easily rated 8, 9, or 10. Then there are these mediocre movies that have so much potential, but just can't come through. It was a great concept, a bunch of married-for-a-while people off to what most thought was just a fun, tropical resort, only to find out only one of the couples knew that couples therapy was a requirement to stay there. Great premise! But unfortunately, they just didn't spend enough time to develop it beyond the premise. And a lot of the humor was pretty raunchy, verging on r-rated. They even blew a chance for an almost obvious scene, where the three men (or was it four?) are walking through the jungle, but can't find their way without following a path, and the path appears to go through a cottage, so they walk through the cottage! Now what would have been funny, is to have the men get into an argument about how they weren't really lost, and that there was no need to stop and ask directions! And then they might have come up with some ridiculous macho-stereotype way of choosing who had to knock on the door of the cottage to ask for directions (but of course, the question would not be directly asked, since men don't ask for directions; this could have been a funny 5-minute scene!), but no, they just have the group walk through someones house! The acting was mostly believable, so you can't fault the cast; it's the script stupids (this comment is directed at the writers of this movie)!

They take 2 of our finest comedians, a beautiful cast of hard working actresses, and a great tropical setting and it comes out a stale, lifeless. laugh-free mess. Man, this was painful to watch. Vince fired off a few smile inducing one liners in the start-up domestic setting, and that was the last smile they got out of me. Once the cast was moved to the tropics, everything went wrong. Male on male embarrassment was overused -- about 5 times. Vince tried a few off the wall diatribes that fell flat. Young women swoon over Jon Favereau (huh?!?!) and he ignores the fabulous Kristen Davis?! The pratfalls to marriage are glossed over and play out badly. Every scene seems to last about 5 beats too long. Favereau gets not one, but two masturbation scenes. What??! Neither comes even close to delivering any humor. All 4 couples have shaky or totally damaged relationships and then in a 10 minute whirlwind finale, all solve their problems in a totally superficial way. And I couldn't possibly have cared less about the ""Guitar Hero"" duel. Yikes!! I guess I blame the writing for being witless, shallow and lazy. The actors take that material and lay an egg with it. And a 1st time director (the legendary ""Ralphie"" of ""Christmas Story"" fame) either couldn't see it or was over-matched by having the writers and producers in front of the camera.A huge disappointment for me, and shocking that this dribble can gross over $100M at the box office.

You should be laughing!""But I saw the trailer, and the one part that had me was the yoga instructor performing REALLY inappropriate positions and doing all that grinding movements, and the suave accent he had....now THAT is my style of comedy...I just love sex jokes and homophobic situations, or things like that. Something about that awkward tension is just insanely hilarious to me.Another reason I wanted to see this movie, is I'm a huge fan of Jason Bateman, from Arrested Development. If you've never seen that show, you must check it out, one of the BEST and brilliant comedy shows out there, period!The movie followed a fairly solid and easy plot, which is obvious, so I won't go into it. The movie had it's funny moments, and a few small failed attempts....not surprisingly enough due to Vince Vaughn! But the scene in the beginning of the movie where an ""apparent"" burglar tries to break into his house, and Vince just casually pulls out a pistol to investigate, THAT had me by total surprise. The last thing I expected to see in this type of comedy was a gun! But more power to anybody who exercises their 2nd amendment rights!Anyways, I thought it was a decent movie. I don't know if people were expecting a lot more out of this movie? I wasn't expecting jack....so maybe that's why I'm giving it higher ratings.Plus I automatically favor any movie that takes place on a tropic island,etc....I'm just tired of seeing cities or sky scraper's for the background on 90% of movies out there today!This comedy wasn't anything ground-breaking, but between all the sexual tension moments, and the yoga instructor and several characters having funny accents....I'd call it a fairly decent comedy.",Couples Retreat

Jason played Jason (he's sometimes funny), but overall, the characters did not suit the actors. There is a ""feel good"" ending, but it took a bit to get there. It all felt contrived and the climax of the film was something you saw coming eventually, with or without the retreat. I was surprised to see the females casted to be matched up with the males casted. I kept thinking in the back of my mind there'd be some sort of swapping, but of course, that does not occur. The child crapping in the toilet in the end was not a necessary scene to keep as it did not enhance the film. I think I laughed about 3 times in the whole film.

88,phantom_fan89,You will enjoy the experience but won't rush back for another booking!,6,20 November 2009,"You may feel a certain dejavue upon viewing a preview for Couples Retreat. Vince Vaughn is playing, well, Vince Vaughn-a charmingly quick witted slacker who doesn't appreciate his beautiful partner or their lifestyle. His best friend is John Favreau playing, well, John Favreau. Add in a host of fish out of water situations, some wise cracks and a lesson learned and you basically have the formula for the last five Vaughn Romcoms. Couples Retreat is slightly elevated from usual fare however, thanks in most part to a stellar ensemble cast.In a desperate attempt to save their marriage Jason and Cynthia (Bateman and Bell) decide to enroll in a Couples Retreat. In order to receive a discount they convince their friends Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Ackerman) and Joey and Lucy (Favreau and Davis) to accompany them. Believing that the trip will be all fun in the sun, the group are chagrin to discover that they must participate in couples therapy or leave. Almost immediately each couple soon begin to discover that their relationships are not as strong as they thought.Couples Retreat does not deserve the critical mauling it has received. It's almost as though critics have been struck with a case of sour grapes. After all Vaughn and Favreau have written a script that has allowed them to go to a tropical paradise with their best friends, surrounded by beautiful women. This is hardly justification for labelling it the worst film of the year! Fame 2009 anyone?Anyone? Couples retreat is far from flawless. The first half of the film succeeds well in holding interest as we too are eager to view what awaits for our couples on this tropical paradise. However once we are are there and the initial awe of the lush green fauna and sparkling blue water have worn of, we-like our couples-must accept that what comes next is not so good. The second half seems to drag on aimlessly until you find yourself wondering what the actual point of the last half hour has been. The ending is also so contrived that you can't help but thinking Vaughn, Favreau and Fox just pulled it out of their backsides so that they could go back to sun baking.The film also suffers from the fact that the female characters are far more underdeveloped than their male counterparts. Ackerman comes across as bland while Bell is your stereotypical neurotic and Davis desperately tries to shake of her good girl image as the lustful housewife. The actresses are just not given the chance to showcase their full potential, making it clear that their main purpose in the film is to look pretty.The men come of far better. Even though Vince Vaughn is doing his usual shtick, he's so gosh darn likable you just can't begrudge him for it. Bateman turns in his best performance since his Arrested Development days, bucking his usual habit of sleepwalking through his roles. Favreau manages to make his very unsympathetic jock character likable and Faizon Love turns in a genuinely hart warming performance as the well intentioned Shane.Vaughn regular John Michael Higgins and cult comedian Ken Jeong deliver hilarious cameos as councilors with Carlos Ponce receiving some of the films most cringe worthy laughs as Salvadore, a sex addicted Yoga instructor. Not faring so well is Jean Reno as retreat instructor Marcel. He seems miscast and his lines fall flat.But the film does try to make some meaningful statements about relationships e.g the grass is not always greener, it is better to be with someone than alone. It also teaches us that average looking guys always have super hot girlfriends and that all women are size two with ripped abs.Despite it's flaws, there is also much to like. A stellar cast, beautiful locations, hot bodies (if your a guy) and yes even a few laughs! Couples Retreat never pretends to be anything more than what it is-A highly enjoyable, if rather forgettable Romcom perfect for a date night.

How do people think that's funny you find yourself thinking. It's really, all in all, not much of anything to the point i can barely find the energy to deride it - why waste the effort when no effort went into making the film in the first place.

Take for instance The Break Up or Four Christmas'....both of these movies have the same feel as Couples Retreat. Dreadful.Couples Retreat just isn't funny. The character development is non existent. It's so bad, you don't even really like any of the whiny characters in the film. There are canned comedy situations linked together by brooding, depressed, complaining couples who are all totally dysfunctional. Not funny dysfunctional in a Clark Griswold way, just dysfunctional in an annoying way that makes you pray for the movie to end.The best way to put this is that the movie is uncomfortable.

93,thecinemaview,"I'll Just Roofie Myself, Thanks.",4,11 October 2009,"Much like the trip at the center of ""Couples Retreat"", this film has so much potential, but ultimately becomes painful and tedious. Unlike the trip, however, there is no joyous ending that makes it all worth while. Instead, it ends with a predictable fizzle that not only betrays what I believe the film was trying to say, but also falls victim to the most woefully-overused conventions of the genre. Its likable cast, all well-trained in comedy and prepared to do anything for a laugh, feel like they are drowning in a bad screenplay that, just when they get their heads above water, pulls them back down again. Admittedly, many people in my theater laughed all the way through it; I credit that to the fact that interrupted masturbation and erections are so uncomfortable, you cannot help but to laugh. The problem, however, is that ""Couples Retreat"" wants to have it both ways: it wants to be an R-rated sex comedy, but also a PG-13 romantic comedy. It falls into an awkward and ineffective area somewhere in between.Read My Full Review Exclusively At: www.thecinemaview.blogspot.com",Couples Retreat
94,clareizaguirre,"Clichéd, stereotyped and truly terrible",3,4 December 2017,"In case you hadn't caught the drift of the other reviewers, Couples Retreat is bad. With such a great ensemble cast and its classification as a comedy you would think that the film would have at least one funny scene but amazingly it didn't! I'm all for enjoying films that are so bad they are good but this was just painfully awful and with such wasted potential too! In isolation, Jon Favreau- top writer and actor, Vince Vaughn- yes always the same character but he is undoubtedly a pro, Kristen Bell- quirky, fun and a great comedy actress, Jason Batemen- who doesn't love Arrested Development, even the great British national treasure that is Peter Serafinowicz pops up in a role plus the man that is Jean Reno from Leon fame! It's actually quite incredible that this combination could go badly.Sure, a couple wishing to reunite their love and passion en rope their unsuspecting friends into the 'holiday of a lifetime' in the picturesque resort of West Eden isn't groundbreaking stuff, but there is a solid foundation from which to develop the film- isn't there? Thinking there would be jet skiing, snorkeling and lazing around the friends are shocked to find out there is a very strict itinerary in place per day. And from hereon it it is cliché after stereotype after character flaw after cringe.Also where the hell did they find Vince Vaughn's Dad from? I haven't seen such bad acting in a long time. The three stars came from Peter Serafinowicz, John Michael Higgins and Jon Favreau making me raise a smile ONCE.I think I need to go and lie down because this irritation is causing a non comedic hernia.",Couples Retreat
95,Ayreesfoxx,"Couples Retreat: What Happens in the Bedroom, Stays on the Cutting Room Floor",2,19 February 2010,"It's no surprise that the concept of a ""romance gone awry"" is old. Not only is it old, it's tired, beaten, and worn down to the point that you can see through to the action and drama sections of your local movie store. So when picking up Couples Retreat, remember that it's a story that has already exhausted all possibilities. Director Peter Billingsley tried his best with what he had – a great cast of actors and an amazing location to work with – but that's only going to get you so far if the oil in the engine needs replacing.Writers and stars in the picture John Favreau and Vince Vaughn depict a time where their friends' marriages are not so fantastic. Joey (Favreau) and his wife Lucy (Kristen Davis) are only staying together long enough to allow their daughter to go to college, while Dave (Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman) are stuck in a rut full of kids, work, and home renovations. Their friend Shane (Fazion Love) is getting over a divorce and in need of support.As you get acquainted with the groups, the last pair Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) recommends a supposed paradise for couples to help everyone reconnect (they themselves were considering a divorce after not being able to conceive a child). It's here that you begin to notice the generalities of each character and you can almost pick the scenarios in which they are going to get back together or fix their issues by the end of the movie - and therein lies the problem.As you see their shortcomings, you know how they are going to fix it all up. Joey and Lucy are angry and spiteful at each other, but you can never figure out why. That's fine however, because it's doesn't mean anything (besides, it even looks like Vaughn and Favreau forgot to write it in the script anyway). Shane is divorced yet continually talks about his ex-wife, which entitles her to show up at the last 15 minutes of the movie without any preconceived explanation. It's all just following the exact same trends that have been passed down ever since ""When Harry Met Sally,"" only sloppily done.Once on the island, the tropical and magical atmosphere of Bora Bora (to them Eden West) doesn't make anything better. The movie begins to run on the cheesy one-liners, the over-the-top sexual antics, and extended jokes that go on for far too long. Even with help from respected French actor Jean Reno, they manage to turn him into a useless piece of plot manipulation.Truthfully, it's a wonder that Billingsley didn't just throw caution to the wind and just give it the R-rating. More than likely with the extra jokes and added content included, it would have brought the plot at least to a bearable standing and they wouldn't have pushed so many seemingly outdated jokes. Yet that is what you are going to run into when you are making a movie with the premise of ""trying to save the love.""To be honest, don't even bother. Unless you are really trying to see a specific actor or actress in the movie (and even then you have to work for it), it's not enough to try. You might be better off and just watch something on prime-time television instead if you're looking for the actor's route. After all, half of the cast was in something else before this and nothing is sweeter than starting out fresh.",Couples Retreat
96,battlereddy,"Wasn't expecting much, but still disappointed",3,8 July 2011,"Although I really like some of the cast, especially Kristen Bell, I just didn't find this funny at all. I didn't find the trailer funny, and wasn't really expecting much, but I had hoped when I watched this on cable that I might find some bright spots. I didn't. I think part of the problem may have been an improperly targeted audience. It seems when a movie tries to appeal to too big of an audience it usually fails. I noticed that the rating was PG-13. I don't know if it was 'toned down' so it could draw a broader and more lucrative audience, but I don't know that teens have the experience to understand adult relationships and I don't know if they would find it funny if they did. I'm an adult with experience in adult relationships and I didn't think it was funny. Kristen Bell can be very funny when given the chance, but as in many cases, I feel she was limited by the material. If not for a well-known cast and the fantastic tropical island location(s) where it was shot I'd likely give the movie 1 star as opposed to the the 3 stars I've given it.",Couples Retreat

That's way too long for a movie like Couples Retreat and they still have to quickly tie up every single loose end in the last ten minutes. How can a movie this long still feel this rushed?

However, it didn't bother me, the enjoyment of the film pushed that all aside for me as it was very enjoyable.Couples retreat is about a couple who cannot have children and their marriage is falling apart because of it.

But the film preview piqued our interest. We were surprised and delighted to see that Peter Billingsley (A Christmas Story) was the Director. He did a fine job! We were quite pleasantly surprised to find Couples Retreat was very touching and poignant in it's handling of the challenges of marriage. Yes, it has some rather sexually suggestive scenes, but they are played for laughs and not personally offensive for us. The resolution of conflicts in the participants lives was very satisfying for us as we believe marriage is worth the effort! The setting in Bora Bora is absolutely breathtaking and we truly enjoyed our afternoon at the movies!",Couples Retreat

In the end it's satisfying because it is predictable and we all need that from time to time, don't we? It's one of those movies the studios probably could have made in a week -- 3 days in Chicago and 4 days in a tropic paradise, snip here and there, add opening and end credits, and call it a day, where the audience seems to laugh only at the scenes that were clipped for the trailer -- the ones that lured them into the theater in the first place. The only thing that would have dragged it down to a 1 would have been the presence of Jennifer Aniston (odd pained facial expression) or Sarah Jessica Parker (squeal).",Couples Retreat
104,Sebastian_Berlin,Dialog so shallow it was almost appalling.,4,15 October 2009,"I just read a few reviews for ""Couples Retreat"" here on IMDb and I agree with most of them. A few good laughs in an otherwise mediocre script and a movie that isn't quite sure of its target audience. Rather than repeat what has been said before, I'd like to use the opportunity to talk about an issue that really bothered me. Towards the end, around the time our main characters reach the fabled ""Eden East"", the jokes recede and the dialog takes on a more serious note. The men start to discuss each other's relationships, which is then followed by a number of appropriate make-up scenes for each of the four couples.Personally, I feel the dialog in that last fourth of the movie was so shallow it was almost appalling. Please don't get me wrong - I know romantic comedies don't usually enlighten us with deep insights into human love and emotions. But on the other hand I reserve the right not to be bullsh*tted. Have you ever had the feeling someone is trying to lecture you on something you have a far deeper and better understanding of? Picture a European soccer fan explaining baseball to you - you, a Yankees ticket holder all your life. Or maybe an accountant advising you, a hardy fisherman, on how to handle your net. You just want to go ""yeah, right"", then turn around and leave.What am I driving at? Well, the point is, that is how I felt about the dialog. I'm not an expert on love, and chances are I never will be. But I know when something rings true and I know when something sounds like hollow garbage. ""Once I saw other men, I learned what I have in you."" Wow. ""He is always planning everything out for us - our relationship feels like a prison."" Deep. ""If you don't make up with your wife, one day, you'll be sitting at Applebees all by yourself."" Oh my, why haven't I thought about this before.Where I live we have a saying: ""If you don't have a clue about it - just shut up."" During the last twenty minutes of this movie, I had the violent urge to grab Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn and shake them until they stop selling me those trivialities like ancient wisdom. I sometimes wonder - is it just me? Do I have a weird perception of things? Maybe most viewers are actually severely touched by those scenes and I am just an insensitive rock? Honestly, I'd be interested to see a statistic.Apart from that, I'm willing to admit there were some enjoyable moments. The boy's first toilet scene made me burst out with laughter. But by far the best thing about the movie was the setting - so beautiful and sunny it made me forget the winter for two hours. And that's worth something.",Couples Retreat

Hard to believe it's been seven years since it was made. Part of the appeal is the place it's filmed, of course, as it is spectacular. But the main thing is the relationship between the couples: at once both close and yet full of tension as only people in long-term friendships would understand. It's certainly not a slapstick, stupid comedy ala Jim Carrey, so if that's your style of comedy you probably wouldn't like it. A big part of the movie's comedy is the couple's counselors, like Ken Jeong and John Michael Higgins. Their discussion of each of the couples' marriage is hilarious.One note: The bonus materials add a lot to the overall experience.

I'm pretty sure that any of those who resisted up to the end of the movies, could find, without too much thinking, at least one or two ideas of jokes, gags, situations, dilemmas, that could have been more fun. Vaughn and his co-writer may have been thinking that the ""shark-drama"", the ""powerpoint"" and the Salvadore character are enough for this movie but they're awfully wrong.

No one tries to steal camera time, and the cast doesn't trip over each other in an attempt to try and be the funniest, they give each other space and the interaction works so organically to the situations within the film.The length of the movie is longer than most romantic comedies as well which is not a problem, but is instead a fantastic opportunity for such a genre to actually explore the individual relationships more personally, instead of using the same old relationship issues that we usually see.I usually pick and choose which actors/actresses I preferred in this movie, but all of the cast just clicked so well for me and kept the movie interesting.A really fun movie, great to watch and watch again and again.

115,maskingtape411,Couples will get bored of this turkey,3,16 February 2010,"Here we have a film where couples' marriages might be in jeopardy so this could be a good comedy for them. It is not. The humor is dry in a bad way, there's not much plot, and the characters are very empty. I suppose they were bored with this too. Here we have a couple who is going to a Couples' Retreat island in the Caribbean. Three others join including one husband played by Vince Vaughn. They all hope to participate in the fun activities along with the marriage therapy yet there's a catch: the three other couples must participate in the therapy and yoga sessions.This is where the ""fun"" comes in. There's an activity involving looking at their partner's body, feeding the fish in the water, and some therapy sessions. It's perfectly fine to fast-forward these since the dialog is SO BORING. Nothing is added to the story, none of the characters improve but who knows. Then there's possibly the only funny part in the movie: the masculine yoga instructor. I grinned once or twice as he gives instructions in the most perverted positions possible. Still I felt like leaving the room many times because of the awfully boring jokes, dialog, and characters.

116,GarethBeaumains,Couple of Laughs,5,12 October 2009,"Went by myself. Ironic, neh? It wasn't Wedding Crashers or Dodgeball, but a mildly funny, watchable movie nonetheless. Don't go expecting Shakespeare.Its take on modern romance is mostly positive: people have good and bad parts of them, but we can all learn to love our spouses better. Though the actors did fairly well with the material, the jokes needed more polish. A few of the best performances were from the couples' counselors and other members of the resort staff, including my favorite, ""Chewbacca."" The most ludicrous moment for me was the gifting of the animal spirits by Jean Reno. They were all rather unfunny until Vince Vaughan received his. He made a comment to his wife before he kisses her that was typical classic Vince.However, the movie is a bit too lagging between its laughs to really be a great comedy, and lacked a true heart of pathos for you to really connect with any of the characters. It ends up a caricature of the couples getaway industry and our modern society.In the film, one of the wives jumps out of her canoe to get away from her annoying husband. Ticked off, she swims to shore alone. Perhaps some fans might be tempted to do the same, and bail out of the movie.This could easily have been a better movie. Better writing. Better cinematography. Better delivery by the cast. But as it was, I'd say it was marginally worth a matinée and the price of popcorn.Scale of 1 to 10: 5.",Couples Retreat

Whatever brought you to this page is surely a reason to see this movie.Want to know why people criticize this movie so harshly? Because they are utterly and absolutely talentless. I would call them hacks, but that would require that they have tried any creative writing in their life, much less the art form known as a screenplay. If you know anything about screenplay writing, then you surely will see how this one mixes in all the right ingredients.Yes, there are some banal jokes, but the jokes are set up well. What does this mean? It means they are foreshadowed and when they play out, they play out by the right character at the right moment. The fact that the haters can't see this is the reason for my attack mentioned above. If they have ever tried to write a screenplay or have ever written something even one step above raw sewage, I would be SHOCKED.I do agree with the critique about the movie jumping a little between serious truth-talking about relationships and just plain fun and silly laughs. Also, I agree about there being some shallowness to the relationships. There are 4 relationships, which makes it difficult to go in depth on each one.

122,thewheelier,Needs some serious humor therapy,3,28 March 2010,"So whats the deal?---4 couples go to paradise in the hopes of getting some R&R while possibly fixing some relationship issues. As expected each hum-drum, suburban pair is mounted with their own range of issues and problems. What follows is a rom-com with just too many sexual innuendos to make this a comfortable viewing experience with anybody except perhaps same-sex partner.( Trust me, there's a least one scene in the film that will make it uncomfortable to watch with anyone of a different relationship) What you already know is in it--- Attractive women paired with overweight to average looking men, Vince Vaugh with sharks, typical relationship problems that are so mundane the writer don't feel to explain them fully or give them any depth, and long glances at people who are not your partner ( but it's OK, 'cause we're on vacation!!!) What you may not know is in it--- Extremely awkward and unfunny sexual themes and innuendos that will demand the laughter of any audience, because having to endure the uncomfortable silence is far worse; i.e. Is Fabio humping an obese black man? Who would let a greased up guy literally mock penetrate his wife in the name of yoga? When does the next scene happen? It's not so much that it contains these type of jokes, ( Some of which can be awkwardly funny) It's just too soon you realize that this is the movie's one-trick-pony....that and guys with funny accents. Yes, this movie has comical maturity and depth of a thirteen year-old boy.Another real problem is---The pacing. It gets off to a good starts then drags terribly, and by 3/4 into it, even the actors seems lost in the screenplay. ""Hey guys what are we doing here?"" I don't know either, but could you just do it faster. By the way, watching someone play Guitar Hero in a movie is about half as entertaining as it is to watch someone play it in real life. And that's not fun at all.Oooh Vince!---When are you going to stop doing these movies? Or better yet when are you going to give a different performance in these movies? Watch a couple of witty quips from Vince Vaugh, as he delivers it with the same presentation as every other rom-com/comedy he's ever done ( identical performance to 'The Break-Up', 'Wedding Crashers', 'Four Christmases',etc) and it's a wrap! It's not all bad!---After all the scenery is beautiful-truly stunning. 10 bucks says the only reason Kristen Bell agreed to do this movie is because she loves the tropics( nostalgia from Forgetting Sarah Marshall I suppose) But seriously it's a decent relationship movie when two people aren't yoga-sexing on screen. The couples are believable and it's easy for the viewer to identify with (some of) their problems. But what middle aged man takes a party-crazed pink haired 20 yr-old he's been dating for 2 weeks on a couple vacation? Oh because he's having a middle life crisis, i get it now you clever, clever writers.What's ridiculous- One couple is pretty realistic with their lives, issues and problems, and comes to a mature, logical, and satisfying realization at the end. The other three all have pretty outlandish, and/or very serious issues, but because we have passed the 90 minute mark lets throw in some comedy-sex, smiles then roll credits. If you're thinking ""What? But what about th-"" at the end, don't worry; its the magic of the credit roll that solves all the characters problems once the last scene ends.Want a more ridiculous, yet funnier movie--- ""Why Did I Get Married"".

125,TimmyDumples,Favreau is the new Vaughn,7,22 September 2009,"Going into a screening of ""Couples Retreat"" I wasn't expecting much due to the weak sack trailer/ads that were being pushed by the studio. But thankfully I was wrong. Although it wasn't close to their best, Vaughn and Favreau still know how to make you laugh. Vaughn was doing his normal act (which at this point he seems to be kicking a dead horse) but all in all he helped the film and didn't distract. Now Favreau wrote himself a little gem in this movie as the guy who is sick of his marriage and just wants to be carefree again. The film has an excellent cast but Favreau definitely stole the show. Every time he was on the screen he was dropping some funny business. All the supporting actors did a great job as well. Was expecting more from Ken Jeong but he wasn't given much to work with. (Has it now become mandatory to put Ken in every movie that comes out just because?) The location was beautiful and they used it wisely. Carlos Ponce also gave an unforgettable performance as the creepy yoga instructor. He was actually at the screening I was at to get a taste of the people erupting with laughter every time he was on screen. Seemed like I was the only one who recognized him to due his change in appearance from the movie. As for all those people who are trying to tag this as a Sarah Marshall ripoff, they couldn't be further from the truth. This movie is set in a tropical location and has Kristen Bell in it. That and it being funny are the only things alike. If you are fan of movies and like to laugh than you might as well see it.",Couples Retreat

128,chant320,In What Dream?,4,21 October 2009,"The movie was almost boring and certainly flat on the comedy side. It's a fade-away movie that, in the future, will play on a Saturday afternoon in the kitchen or while tinkering in the garage cause nothing note worthy happens and the plot contains mostly male adolescent jokes.Biggest complaint: Disconnect on ages and appearances between the women and men. Women were too young for the parts they played against the men. All the women (even the two oldest) looked fabulous, (as all women must be to even GET a part in Hollywood). The men were overweight to grossly overweight and appeared even older on screen than they actually are in real life. It was an sharp imbalance that made the movie even worse. Like, oh yeah, these beautiful, fit, youthful, majorly doable women would be seen with these guys, let alone married to them. Right.

In the case of Couples Retreat I watched without first checking the rating. Contrary to many of the reviews, I found Couples Retreat to be very funny. I laughed a lot throughout. It's interesting that many who liked the Hangover did NOT like Couples Retreat. I personally found the Hangover to be one of the most disappointing movies of the year. Couples Retreat on the other hand was very engaging, somewhat plausible and as I said, very funny. You probably have to be 35 or older, with children, to really appreciate some of the subtle aspects of the movie. I guess that is why the 20 something audience, who loved the Hangover, did not like this movie. My advice to these dissenters.... watch it again in 15 to 20 years when you have grown up! :-)",Couples Retreat
131,s-reid-642-540762,Racism is not dead,3,2 February 2010,"Wow! This movie was a big let down. Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau, and Faizon Love are the only reasons I give this movie a 3 out 10. If it wasn't for their comedy I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10. Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau were hilarious. It was nice to see Faizon Love finally get some work. It's sad that the writers or directors did not take advantage of his comedic talent with good comedy. Instead they made Faizon play a (stereotypical) role of an American of colour. Even though the black portrayal was racist, Faizon was Faizon, and made funny out of a bad script. The character of Faizons girlfriend was also very stereotypical and very annoying throughout the entire movie. No offence to her personally, because I'm sure that she had talent that the director refused to utilize in this movie. It's also too bad that Faizons on screen girlfriend received more camera time than his wife (Tasha Smith). Tasha Smith is such a great actress and deserved more camera time. Hey director (Peter Billingsley), referring to a black woman as being a ""black panther"" is racist. I wish I could elaborate more on the negative stereotypes in this movie. Unfortunately I cannot without giving away what happens in the movie. In conclusion Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and Faizon Love were very funny....Tasha Smith should have gotten more camera time....and it's a shame that black Americans were portrayed so poorly in this movie.",Couples Retreat

I kept waiting for a great climax to developed, but nothing! If this movie was a drama/romantic movie then it would've been a lot better... It's just not funny...

137,casstanhope_13,Couples Retreat,9,12 December 2013,"Jon Favreau, Vince Vaught, Faizon Love, Jason Bateman, Kristin Davis, Kristen Bell, Malin Akerman and Jean Reno all co-star in the 2009 romantic comedy Couples Retreat. The cast members are paired as couples and the film begins in the home of Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristin Bell) with a presentation on why they need a vacation. Starting with the fact that their marriage is on the rocks, they also explain they are having trouble having a child. After finishing the whole slide show the twist is that this couple can only go on this trip if their group of friends goes along with them.After a few convincing talks all the couples take the trip to paradise. The film is set on a gorgeous island and many birds eye view or extremely high camera angles are used to capture the entire beauty of the island where they believe they will be spending and enjoyable and easy vacation. The couples soon realize that their friends Cynthia and Jason have in fact taken them to a tropical paradise, but left out the part that the trip will also be filled with couples therapy and bonding experiences. The director Peter Billingsley does a good job of using high and low camera angles to catch each expression on of the actors as they find out what this wonderful vacation is really all about. He also used wide angles to capture they group reaction to each other and to that of their instructors during each exercise. None of the couples take the exercises with their therapist and instructors seriously except for the neurotic couple Jason and Cynthia.After a long day of therapy the couples learn that this island is not only their side (Eden West) but there is also a singles side (Eden East). The couples decide to make the trip to go and explore the singles area of the island and have a little fun. After a fight about numerous life problems Cynthia leaves in an uproar. The women follow Cynthia and the men with Jason. The women make it to the waterfall fine and run into a handsome man that works for the hotel. They all share drinks and begin to tell him their problems and as a person on the facility he helps them as he flirts his way into more details about each ladies lives.Meanwhile the men have found the cottage of one of their therapist. During the day he seems very pronounced and respected. However they find that he is no more than a geek who loves to play guitar hero.Dave of the men on trip challenges the therapist to a duel if he win they are pointed to the waterfall and no one needs to know they were there and if the therapist wins then he will leave immediatelyThe acting in this movie was great, and although these were not real couples they made every seen realistic and believable. However they worked well together and I was in stitches during the entire film. The director knew how to play with lighting and scenery to feel romance, frustration, totally awkward, and perfectly at piece. The land scape was picked very well for this movie and they story line and twist made it all the more enjoyable.Overall I would recommend this movie. The placement of the camera was great, the scenery was gorgeous and the actors and actresses really know how to make a movie enjoyable. I would recommend this movie to any audience and be ready to laugh.",Couples Retreat

It starts out well, but somewhere about 20 minutes in, seems to lose its way and it never comes back.I have seen worse movies, and there are a few funny moments.

I won't describe the plot for obvious spoiler purposes, but I will describe one aspect of this movie that really upset me. After 30 minutes of viewing, I noticed that the black actors in this movie were being duped. Well, maybe they were duping other black people for taking the gig.Faizon's character was a black man who was broke, had a thing for young women, and always borrows money from Vince Vaughn. Kali's character was a woman with multiple boyfriends, money hungry, and couldn't speak proper English. Every stereotype was fulfilled with these two characters. They both had little lines in the script, and absolutely no banter with the other white actors. Matter of fact, every time they spoke, no one would respond; there would be blank stares. Of course they gave Faizon a typical catch-phrase; bang-bang. How original. Anyways, I'm white and I can see the racism bleeding through the screen as it is so obvious. That's why this movie grabbed about 50 minutes of my time. Hopefully people will just leave this one alone. Not to mention, the script is soulless. That's why I am so heartless.",Couples Retreat

I find that a lot of comedies are just plain humor with no story. It shows the troubles and sacrifices of marriage. It is a great date movie and I did not find a dull moment in the movie. The cast was funny and played there roles well. The movie had some obvious truths to life and marriage and they made it comical. You should disregard the negative comments about this film. It is definitely worth seeing and was very funny. I liked all Vince Vaughn's films and the difference here is that it is not just stupid comedy but partially more believable.

BUT On the other hand I cant say I regret watching it. It had a vibrant and fun feel to it, although it does carry pathetically unrealistic; tipsy tourney unreasonable scenes, you definitely paid attention to the movie.

If it had been R, our mid west village would not have shown it, as only PG-13 and lower are shown. Was a nice evening out and the theater was absolutely packed with couples. On our way out we did notice a few from High School. The laughs come constantly but there are a few scenes that make you think of your relationship and how you might be able to make it better.

The age and beauty of the women was off balance with the men. 10 years in the case of Jason Batmen and Kristin Bell. 8 years with Vince Vaughen and Malin Akerman. And perhaps up to 20 with Faizon Love and Kali Hawk, which actually is noted in the movie. HOWEVER it never comes up with the other couples. Not to mention the fact that none of these men would ever end up with ANY of these women in the real world. Since the movie was using average (at best) looking men then more fitting actresses may have been: Molly Shannon, Toni Collette, Mo'Nique, and Janeane Garofalo. All women who are still beautiful and could/would pull off the half nude scenes and are much better actress than the selected cast and more suiting for the average male cast. The only fitting actress Kali Hawk's, even though an awful actress, age and beauty was fitting for the part. It's almost as if a bunch of buddies got together wrote a movie, cast themselves, and then picked their fantasy women to play their wives. Oh yeah wait... that is what happened.",Couples Retreat

I went to see it with my bf and my best friend and her bf and my friend and I were both laughing throughout the movie. It was funny and I don't think it disappoints from that perspective. There are some scenes that don't really make much sense such as Jason Bateman's character trying to sneak into Vaughan's character's house in the middle of the night because he was distressed. Who does that?!? And the guys deciding to go through someone's house when they are on the other island instead of going around. Again, who does that?!? They were both very obviously done to continue the haphazard plot in the time alloted for the movie. Besides the odd plot, there was also the script. The women characters seem to be very muted most of the time. I expected a lot more from Kristen Davis' character.

The beginning of the film was rushed and the writers used a pitiful excuse to actually get all the characters to 'paradise.' Once there, the antics are predictable and the gags set up well in advance. For a big budget movie, the 'shark' effects were appalling and you get the distinct feeling that much of the film was left on the cutting room floor, as scenes jump around and never actually seem to finish.

I figured it would be Vince Vaughn and his friends having some fun in paradise, but I was wrong. The whole moving was just everyone yelling at each other and bickering back and forth.Plot: The plot revolves around 3 married couples and a dating couple who decide to go to Eden West and have a nice vacation. When they get there, they are all excited for fun in the sun until they are told they need to attend ""couples healing"" or something like that. Not to bad in my opinion. I like the premise and i thought it could be good but I was WRONG! Characters: Vince Vaughn: He basically played every other character he has ever played. After the shark scene, he just became really annoying.Jason Bateman: Was not thrilled at all. He seemed like an uptight twit that wanted to do everything right. Real lame to me.John Favreau: He was the little comedic effect in this movie. I thought he would be funnier and have some good scenes with Vaughn, but no. He seemed like a real asshole to me.Faizon Love: Nothing to say with him. Really wasn't in it a lot. Kinda disappointed me. I like Fazion. Nothing can beat ""Big Worm"" from Friday.Malin Akerman: Vince Vaughn's wife. Again, she was boring, but she was so HOT in this movie.Kristen Bell: Jason Bateman's Wife. She seemed uptight too, but she was also very hot.Kristin Davis: John Favreau's wife. Annoying to me. Always fighting with her husband and her voice just annoys me in this movie.Kali Hawk: Not to bad.

Without giving any spoilers, all I can say is that it felt like each time the characters started becoming believable and we were getting into the story, another painfully exaggerated or gross scene would jump up.

157,mrs-smith89,not a bad movie,10,21 February 2010,"I checked IMDb before I watched this movie, naturally, and I was surprised by what I read. The reviews were absolutely scathing on it.The best part about that, however, is that no one slamming this movie is an actual critic. They are individuals with their own opinions and everyone likes a negative review better than a good one. Regardless, here is my good one.This story was never meant to be a raunchy comedy or a 'pathetic remake of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'', as one reviewer thought. Jumping to that conclusion based solely on the cast of the movie shows what little thought process some of these reviewers had. Yes, the cast is made up of a group of hilarious comedic actors. But no, this is not their typical work. Couples Retreat is a chick flick, with a few scenes to make the boyfriend happy. I enjoyed it because it wasn't too disgusting or too weepy. It fell steadily in the middle and the situations and relationships were real. My husband and I could very closely relate to Ronnie and David. Our relationship goes through the same strains and we also have two young boys. And I know friends of mine who are similar to the other couples.If you need an alone night with your significant other and you're looking for a feel-good movie with some funny situations mixed in, this is for you.Also, I felt the need to defend Vince Vaughn, as one reviewer put him down a little too much for my taste. This is not the character he always plays. Because of the way he speaks and projects himself, he seems similar in every movie. But guess what- speaking the same does not make it the same character. That's just the way the guy talks! Give him a break. He's a funny actor. I've seen many movies with him in it and the way he talks alone cracks me up. He actually goes out on a limb in this movie to be sincere and loving, and he does a good job. All of the actors do good jobs. This movie deserves a lot more raving than ranting, but you know, you can't control everyone. ;)",Couples Retreat

I disagree with both of these.Sure this movie is NOT what you would expect when you hear the word comedy, but it seems to fall into its own sub-comedy genre, much like the recent Adam Sandler flick, Funny People. You aren't going to sit on your couch laughing till your ""thing"" falls off, but you will enjoy a simple and relaxing movie while enjoying a few cheap giggles at the relatable characters and situations they find themselves in.Jon Faverau is gold, as you would expect by now. Vince Vaughn plays his usual cynical, monotonous character, but you expect this from him by now and the comedy of this style of acting bleeds through.I will not try to say that Couples Retreat is a good movie by a critic's point of view, but it's just a movie that you can pick up on DVD watch and then put away until another time you feel like watching it again.",Couples Retreat
161,rekelman,couples retreat,8,30 May 2010,"Film with realistic scenes and nice jokes. In a tropical environment relations become clear. Time is spent useful to solve problems. After time relations show how they really are. Sometimes its better to work on your relationship. Instead of short term pleasure and falling in love. Love appears in time. Conclusion is that couples retreat is a very refreshing funny movie with realistic relation issues. A film with interesting psychological behaviour in a comedy centered around four couples who settle into a tropical-island resort for a vacation. While one of the couples is there to work on the marriage, the others fail to realize that participation in the resort's therapy sessions is not optional. Realistic scenes in a beautiful environment. Sometimes holidays can be excellent to solve relation problems!",Couples Retreat
162,cramorataps,Very Funny Very good,8,24 July 2013,"This was a very funny movie. It not only had humor, it had heart and redeeming values. All the scenes with the individual Therapy Sessions were particularly funny. All the actors are strong, and the rapport with Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau has not lost a step. The nicest surprise in this film would have to be the banter between Vaughn and Peter Serafinowicz. The movie also pleasures visually with the scenery of Bora Bora. Some people may very well be offended by the yoga instructor, although he adds to the comedy as well. The children in the movie are cute, and provide some humor, but have small parts, the movie is mostly taking place at the retreat Island known as ""Eden"". I enjoyed this film and would recommend it for at least a few viewings.",Couples Retreat
163,keith-crunk-974-731435,Gets better and better,8,11 February 2011,"The first time I watched this movie, I thought of it as very average. However, this movie gets better and better the more times you watch it. Now, I don't pop this movie in the blue-ray player on a night when I have nothing to do, but this movie has been on HBO a lot lately, and every time I come across it, I find myself watching the next 20-30 minutes of it, and laughing a lot.Maybe it's because I am married and the jokes in the movie are fun to crack with my wife ... I don't know, but this movie cannot be judged based on just watching it once. Maybe it's also because Ctanley (yes, Stanley with a C) reminds me of a guy that I used to work with.Vince Vaughn is classic, as always. One of the few actors that can be the same type of character in every movie and play it off perfectly.The rest of the cast of characters is perfect for the movie - a great mix of 8 friends who all have their own personalities.",Couples Retreat
164,ian-bossert,Such an underrated movie!! A+++++,10,20 July 2011,"I cannot believe the reviews this movie is getting on IMDb. This movie is hysterical to me. I'm not sure what these critics look for in a movie, but this movie continues to make me laugh no matter how many times I watch it. It doesn't get better than Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau, Faizon Love, and Jason Bateman. I watch this movie *at least twice a month*. This is my favorite movie out of any movie I have ever seen. The storyline is perfect, and the cast could not have been hand-picked better.Please, *I strongly encourage you* to watch this movie if you have not seen it. Don't listen to these critics if you are debating whether to watch the movie. Watch the movie, and determine for yourself if it was worth it. I'm watching it as I'm writing!!! A++++++",Couples Retreat
165,ryanwade1234,Great location?,4,31 August 2018,"I have to admit I only watched it because I'm going to Bora Bora... wow this was a horrible movie. Cheesy in every sense. Awkward, not funny, and just uncomfortable.",Couples Retreat
166,shannonconeal,Great Movie = Top 5,10,27 January 2019,I own a Zebra and you own a Goat ... what does that have to do with it? ... I'm not sure why others didn't like this movie - it is so funny! So Real life ... I feel like I know each of these guys / couples! Boom ~ Wink! Yes this movie is in my Top 5 * Love the scenery and all the actors did a great job! Really did love this movie - sorry all the haters are at Applebees alone.,Couples Retreat
167,matt-leveller,So unforgettable I had to google what it was called,5,13 August 2019,"Watched it on Netflix.
Couple of laughs but instantly forgettable.
Chatting with friends 5 minutes afterwards and not one of us could remember what it was called.
That sums it up.
Don't waste your time if you like film making, films, acting, humour, craft, attention to detail etc.
You might end up watching it on a long flight when you've already watched 4 other films.
Shame really because there are some amazing comedy actors in the film but it looks like they've decided to go on holiday.
Seriously, Don't bother.",Couples Retreat
168,irishdancingmonkey,Why do people hate this?,10,19 August 2018,I don't understand why everyone hates this movie and thinks it isn't funny! This movie is a favorite in my group of friends. We constantly quote it!,Couples Retreat
169,janettemoman,Hilarious if you are Generation X and married for years,8,8 April 2017,"5 stars? Really? I LOVE this movie. If it ever comes on TV my hubby and I totally crack up. We actually like the couples and their personalities and idiosyncrasies. We'd take this stupid vacation and put up with the Pelican Package for that paradise. One of my favorite scenes is when they are considering going home on day one when they realize they have requirements, then they get all that amazing food and drinks - so, so funny! I know the feeling - give me an awesome dinner and I will say yes, too! I about die during the therapy sessions, and nothing...nothing is better than the yoga with Salvadore. Those moments alone are worth the whole movie. We actually like this as a couple - but I can see how certain generations wouldn't like it. You need to watch the UNEDITED version - TV edits out the best moments.",Couples Retreat
170,meaghermk,Guilty pleasure,9,27 August 2019,"I love this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it is really funny",Couples Retreat
171,glyeakley,Worst movie I've seen in a while...,5,25 September 2010,"I watched this for free On Demand and still felt ripped off. Where do I start? The tone is so uneven that the scenes with the therapists are played straight despite the fact that two of them were played by John Michael Higgins and Ken Jeong, two guys who must struggle NOT to get laughs. It is almost as if they hired the actors and then decided to go a different direction -- if they even put that much thought into it. Before this debacle finally and mercifully staggers to an end it starts to feel as if they are literally making it up as they go along. There is no clear reason for this movie to even exist except as an excuse for the cast and crew to enjoy an nice tropical vacation, squeezing in a little movie work while they are there. Lazy, unprofessional filmmaking that is an insult to the audience.",Couples Retreat
172,georgievalu,Good for couples indeed,9,1 October 2018,"Maybe shallow at first sight. However, the movie can make you think and reconsider certain aspects of your past or current relationship. I liked it. It was funny also.
I am sure that such great cast saw the depth of the matters and that's why they agreed to participate.",Couples Retreat
173,teresecavaggioni,All About Expectations,8,25 October 2009,"A lot may be surprised at seeing 8/10, but hopefully by the end you'll understand why. Going into this movie with two friends no one was really expecting much, especially me who hates cliché romance comedy films. Maybe though that is why I was able to crack up at the stupid/lame humor throughout the film. My friends and I, along with the rest of the theater, died laughing when the yoga guy was ""assisting"" all of them.This movie didn't have a single new/exciting aspect that other films romance comedies try to achieve (except maybe all the guys weren't that attractive). Based on what your purpose is in seeing this film, it doesn't have to be. I make jokes/comments while watching movies in general, and this one definitely allows you to enjoy it but also talk to your friends without them ""wanting to watch"" If you are looking for a movie that moves you in some way or has some new aspect to it, I can understand giving it a crappy rating/review. For those who are just hanging out with friends looking for something that allows you to get a few laughs + talk without feeling like the film requires everyone be silent I highly suggest it. I don't plan on buying it when it comes out, but I enjoyed the experience and how happy everyone seemed to be as a result.",Couples Retreat
174,linda19116,Popcorn,2,27 October 2009,"Unfortunately most people read reviews AFTER seeing the movie. I promise to read reviews BEFORE seeing the film. I was fidgeting in my seat after being subjected to 40 minutes of ""previews"" so my mood was not the best when the film started. I was embarrassed for the black guy who couldn't bend over due to his large belly. And I was embarrassed for the ladies who were molested by the tantric yoga guy. That's not how yoga should be taught. Especially, I was envious of Vaughn who I'm sure will walk away with millions from this disaster. i know what is wrong with it but I can't tell Vince. GET A BETTER LIFE DUDE. The best thing about this film was the one dollar popcorn the UA offers on Tuesdays.",Couples Retreat
