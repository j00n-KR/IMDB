0,Leofwine_draca,A good idea...,4,25 February 2020,"ASSASSINATION NATION is a cutting edge modern thriller with a mixture of good and bad points. Generally the latter outweigh the former, although this isn't without interest. I did love the whole idea of updating the Salem witch trials into the 21st century, but the heavy handed execution could have been better. The cinematography is strong throughout leaving this a visual treat at times with particularly good focus of the colour palette. However, the writing is what lets this one down. It's bang on when it comes to social media and the mob mentality, but at the same time it forgets to create any likeable or sympathetic characters. You're supposed to like and identify with the main girls but they come across just as self-centred and gloating as the rest. This is the kind of film that makes modern America look like a cesspit more than anything else, and it left me feeling depressed overall.",Assassination Nation
1,SnoopyStyle,a muddle of girl power,5,28 January 2019,"Lily Colson (Odessa Young) likes to party with her high school best friends Bex, Em, and Sarah. Lily has been sexting with ""Daddy"" behind her boyfriend's back. Someone has hacked into the Mayor's life causing him to commit suicide. The next victim is the school's principal who becomes vilified by the town. The town becomes unhinged when half the town gets hacked. Lily's sexting with Daddy is revealed to be Nick Mathers (Joel McHale), the father of her babysitting job.The first half's issue is the lack of character definition and a lack of individual personality. The girls become a mob and it's hard to get invested in this amorphous mob of teens. The Daddy texts are the only truly compelling character work being done. It's all a drunken party girls mess. If there is any hope, it comes in the form of a surreal Purge turn. There is an attempt at doing toxic masculinity with a lot of slu7 shaming but it gets muddled with various plot developments. Reagan getting whacked with a bat doesn't fit. It would be so much more effective without Lily suspected of being the hacker. It's an excuse for the mob. It would be more on point if the mob rises up to fight her slu7dom. It's obvious that Sam Levinson is trying to do something. It would be much more effective if it isn't such a muddled mess.",Assassination Nation
2,boblipton,Surprising Thriller,8,15 July 2020,"In the suburban town of East Salem, Massachusetts, four girls are dealing with high school, complaining that no one gets them, etc. etc. Then someone hacks every phone in town, downloads them to the Internet, and everyone goes crazy.. Every secret in town is out, people kill themselves or form mobs to lynch a high school principal who has photos of his daughte when she was five or so, running naked around the back yard. People have never dealth with anything like this before, so they start acting according to the only model they know: grindhouse movies that play on latte-night television.The first half is largely shot with shaky cel phone video, interspersed with the occasional art shot (the four teenage protagonists, lying with their heads together, like the spokes of a huge wheel, while a crane shot rotates above them), to be supplanted by sharp movie photography in the final third. Add in some sharp dialogue and the most chilling final line I've heard in soe time, and you have a great movie.",Assassination Nation
3,Prismark10,Always use a VPN,6,9 September 2019,"A twisted modern interpretation of Arthur Miller's The Crucible with The Purge thrown in.The town of Salem, Massachusetts is in uproar as a data hacker has exposed the private life of the Mayor as a gay crossdresser. Then the high school principal who refuses to resign from his job when he is wrongly labelled as a peadophile. The citizens are angry but then there is a mass data leak regarding many inhabitants of the town whose dirty secrets are exposed. They then form a vigilante group to find the anonymous hacker.Lily Colson (Odessa Young) is a high school student who is slut shamed when incriminating pictures and texts are released. It turns out she has been sexting the father whose family she has been babysitting for.An angry mob gather for revenge when Lily is blamed to be the hacker, even though she has been publicly humiliated as well. Her other friends Sarah (Suki Waterhouse) Bex (Hari Nef) and Em (Abra) become victims of the witch hunt. As mob violence erupts, the young women arm themselves and fight back.The film wants to expose the hypocrisies of the rule makers that then go on to break the rules they set. The Mayor who was anti gay & lesbian for example. It was obviously aimed at the evangelist churches in America who take into their arms a serial liar, groper and womaniser as president of the USA as long as he keeps appointing Judges that will overturn Roe v Wade.The film is sloppy to get going with oversexualised high school teenagers heavily into social media. The latter part of the film becomes an effective exploitation revenge thriller.I could not help thinking that their was misogyny in the heart of the film. Why were the baying crowd all men who craved violence on women?",Assassination Nation
4,nogodnomasters,You want to kiss me daddy?,7,15 December 2018,"Someone hacks into everyone's cell phone in the small town of Salem and posts it publicly. The secrets are explosive, especially those around four high school girls who are suspect, especially Lily (Odessa Young). The town goes from Budd Dwyer to ""The Purge."" Lily does a lot of first-person narration to explain thematic material...""No one wants the real you.""Somewhere out there someone is writing a college paper on the digression of teen girl films and how it overlaps with the collapse of societal norm and civilization as predicted in the 1973 MIT computer study and re-affirm civilization will be dead by 2040-2050. The firm is quirky and violent. The opening warning claims there is rape in the film, but I all I saw was near rape. Purge+ Mean Girls?Guide: F-word. Brief sex. No nudity.",Assassination Nation
5,BandSAboutMovies,A gorgeous but muddled mess,5,24 September 2018,"Assassination Nation has no idea what kind of movie that it wants to be. It's the kind of film that wants to desperately wants and needs to be important, to provoke you with sex and violence and provocative themes while at the same time giving you a list of potential trigger warnings before the story begins. And yet even that warning is shot in a winking way, like the square up before Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS. I doubt that's the comparison the filmmakers want, because this is also a film yearning to be important, to be discussed, yet it seems to have disappeared into theaters.The fact that the movie takes place in Salem, Massasschutesetts is the first of many sledgehammer subtle points that the script makes. There, our four heroines - Lily, Bex, Em and Sarah - are normal teenage girls dealing with high school and growing up and hormones and all the horror that goes with it.For some, it's harder than others. Lily has stopped being a babysitter for the Mathers family after the father's (Joel McHale) attentions got to her. That hasn't stopped her from continuing to text him and referring to him as Daddy, despite her relationship with Mark (Bill Skarsgard, It). Beks is transgender and has a crush on Diamond, who wants to keep their hookup a secret. Em and Sarah really never get a chance to define who they are, to be perfectly honest.A wannabe hacker named Marty is asked to spread a file with images and videos of anti-gay Mayor Bartlett having sex with men and dressing in women's clothes. This causes the mayor to go into a downward spiral and kill himself at a press conference. As the police try to investigate, everyone in town becomes hacked, like Principal Turrell, who is one of the few positive adults in the film. His phone has photos of his child nude, which makes everyone think he's a pedophile, yet he refuses to stop being an educator. His story kind of stops there, despite all the investment the movie has put into it so far.From there on out, the town's secrets are revealed. Cheerleader Reagan (Bella Thorne) leaked her best friend's (Maude Apatow, daughter of Judd) nude photos and must pay. Lily's secret sexting older man is revealed and his family leaves him. Lily's photos and videos that she would send the older man and revealed and Mark and his friends hold her down and take photos of her body marks to prove it's her in a harrowing scene. Her life goes to hell as her parents kick her out, men chase her with knives and the entire town soon believes that she's behind the hacks thanks to Marty revealing that tons of internet traffic was coming from her house (it's worth noting that Becca instantly figured out the film's big reveal here).Here's where the film either gets suspenseful or narratively falls apart, depending on your point of view. Everyone in the town starts wearing masks to hide their identity and sins from one another, which is an interesting plot point if the masks they wore didn't look exactly like The Purge. Again, this is a movie that yearns to be taken seriously with a woke angel on one shoulder while the devil on the other keeps pulling it toward exploitation. Because it never really goes all in on either side, it becomes somewhat of a muddled mess.That isn't to say the final scenes aren't packed with suspense, including a stedicam sequence outside and inside the house as masked assailants invade the home and take the girls hostage that recalls Dean Cundy's landmark work in Halloween. And the standoff between Lily and Nick, her ""daddy,"" is filled with eye-popping close-ups and intense violence, with the gore actually grossing out people in our theater versus titillating them.That's when the film descends into empowerment fantasy territory, with the girls donning red trenchcoats ala Female Prisoner: Scorpion. Most people would probably get past the scene of the girls in bed quickly, but it felt like the brakes being slammed for me. You know, this is pure Quentin Tarantino territory - this is obviously some alternate reality where the most popular girls in school all get together to cosplay watch an incredibly deep cut Japanese rape revenge film. That said, you can totally buy the official jacket from the film now.The girls unleashed their vengeance on the town before Lily find the time to make a viral video that unites all of the young women in town as they come face to face in a final confrontation with the masked male of Salem.If the film stopped here and gave no answers as to why this all happened, but instead just kept the narrative that bad things happen for no reason, I may have liked it more. I liked that the fate of the main characters could be left up to the viewer, but the closing scene establishes the true ending.I think Sam Levinson is a hell of a director. This film looks gorgeous and attempts some really technical sequences, like the home invasion, as well as split screens that would make DePalma jealous. The colors, the textures, the rapid pops as footage zooms in - all gorgeous. But the story is lacking. Lily's final speech wants so badly to be a rallying cry, but so much of it comes off as an apology that's an actual lack of apology. Everybody has bad secrets in their closet in Salem, but it's the young women who have never had a chance to do things the right way - well, at least our four protagonists and their sisters that rally between them, at least - who are the ones in the right. Lily is able to admit that she's done things that are wrong, but seems to write them off in this speech.Assassination Nation wants to be Heathers for the SJW generation, vehemently denounced by the establishment and endlessly debated on talk shows and in classrooms, but it seems like no one really cared. Instead, it comes off as ""What if Harmony Korine directed The Purge ?""It's a movie that at the same time wants to empower women and give them a voice while putting masculine weapons into their hands and allowing them to shoot and stab their way to emancipation, skirting the issue that we live in a world where mass shootings happen nearly every single day, but the right good guy or girl with a gun is the narrative difference. If that true, how is your side any more correct than the other side? Instead of picking a side, instead of choosing between parable and pablum, this film makes no such choice.The credit sequence - in which an African-American marching band drumline steps through the carnage of the town to their version of Miley Cyrus's ""We Don't Stop"" sums up this film perfectly. It looks gorgeous, it seems transgressive and it feels like it has something to say but is ultimately sound and fury signifying nothing.",Assassination Nation

Because only rapists convicted in the Court of Public Opinion are approved by Vlad to gain enabler SCOTUS positions for the Pachyderm Party's incipient Sex Police, it's no wonder that EVERY current example of Pachyderm Supreme Injustice is a practicing member of History's most notorious Cult of Sexual Perversion.

8,morrison-dylan-fan,Nation Assassination.,8,22 January 2020,"Catching clips on weekly box office chart shows,I was taken by how off-beat this flick looked,but disappointed to find that after it flopped in the US, it got dumped everywhere else. Looking on eBay over the New Year holiday,I was happy to find the title on disc,leading to me at last seeing this state of the nation.View on the film:His first upload since 2011's Another Happy Day, writer/director Sam Levinson unlocks the fourth wall in a frenzied opening smashing into future events to take place in the film, which slides into Levinson closely working with cinematographer Marcell Rev & editor Ron Patane, Levinson synch up a ultra-stylised atmosphere of bright red pop-ups and fractured txt messages being layered over the girls.Sitting with the gang watching the Pinky Violence movie Delinquent Girl Boss: Unworthy of Penance (1971), Levinson takes the pulpy sparks of the Pinky Violence and Giallo genres, and twists them into abrasive Pop-Art of a outstanding long take weaving the camera tracking a home break-in, which rolls into startling streaks of red firing up the avenging Femme fatales.Whilst the coda is a bit too on the nose, the screenplay by Levinson gleefully laughs at the audience with a sarcastic ""Trigger Warning"" opening, that becomes locked and loaded to a thrilling survive the night onslaught the gang get caught up in.Going online in Salem, Levinson takes a wickedly sly twist in creating the Salem Witch Trials for the internet age, where illegally uploaded/stolen files turns the locals into a absurdest online hate mob, whose keyboards lock onto staging a trial for this gang in the assassination nation.",Assassination Nation

As it's a showcase of how the world is today with social media and face book, twitter, and being connected to one another. However when things go wrong and as things are revealed it's chaos like world war III! That's just what happens in a town like Salem when a data hack exposes the secrets of everyone even their most private I phone and computer moments reveal the most intimate moments! Never fear four young high school girls take it upon themselves to bring old fashion kick butt kind of justice, as no one in the town is safe! It's just a good satire and spin to show how that many will fight for social and private rights, as it's clear technology and means of connection are still driving society and it needs to be fought for and protected. Overall different and far out film that's message is to stand up and fight for the right of freedom and to protect the human masses.",Assassination Nation

The movie was written and directed by rookie filmmaker Sam Levinson, and it stars Odessa Young, Hari Nef, Sukie Waterhouse, Abra, Joel McHale and Bella Thorne. It's received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and it also bombed at the Box Office so far. I enjoyed most of it. The film is a little slow-paced at times, and hard to watch too (due to it's disturbing content), but it's also really involving and insightful (in an exaggerated way). The movie is also full of some cool Grindhouse thrills, at and near it's climax.",Assassination Nation
11,ThomasDrufke,Haunting,8,3 October 2018,"I can't exactly say I will ever watch Assasination Nation again, but boy is this film an extremely impactful one. Coming out at the height of the social media craze, mixed in with the age of hackers and leaks, this film rings more true to the current societal issues in 2018 than I thought it would. Focusing on a group of 4 high school girls who get caught up in an ultra data hack, are forced to come to grips with their lives being entirely put on the internet, and the fact that the entire town thinks they're behind it. A gorgeous film to look at, with all sorts of beautiful and powerful imagery, there's not a glaring weak spot here. In fact, all four of the female leads are terrific and the third act truly displays their inner bada**ery. With a great score, inventive direction, haunting violence, and a lasting message, Assasination Nation is one of the most unique films of the year.8.8/10",Assassination Nation
12,Cineanalyst,Trolling,4,11 February 2021,"I watched ""Assassination Nation"" after having seen Sam Levinson and company's subsequent ""Malcolm & Marie"" (2021), which I enjoyed for its austere reflexive commentary on filmmaking and film criticism, as well as for the elegant black-and-white cinematography. This is quite a letdown of excessive, exploitative proportions by comparison. The high-tech ""Mean Girls"" (2004) exposing of smart-phone records that turns a town (named Salem, as in the witch trials, of all obvious things) against four high-school girls with ""The Purge"" (2013) levels of absurd violence also unfortunately reminds me of the season of ""South Park"" where the animated characters went crazy over internet trolling and their social-media accounts being hacked.This may be enjoyed for similar comedic excess--seemingly everything being thrown at the wall to see what sticks, split-screen shots followed by tracking views outside a home's windows, painfully up-to-date dialogue and narration complete with ""trigger warnings"" there just for the ""lols,"" American flags and masks thrown up and on at the end, for reasons, I guess.... At least, I can't see how it could be taken seriously as a commentary on modern society's use of phones and the internet, 4chan, or ""toxic masculinity,"" ""cancel culture,"" or any other buzzy things. And as an exploitation, if not sexploitation, flick of teenage-girl vengeance, it's not in much of a position to pretend to be advocating on the behalf of female victims of abuse and societal sexism, or whatever. I suppose there's a symmetry to the chaotic and junky appeal to a lack of an attention span, whether on the movie or phone screen, but it's an aesthetic of the same uncritical, wired culture that it's supposedly satirizing.",Assassination Nation
13,westsideschl,View Changed as I Watched,8,3 January 2019,"Initially, and for quite a ways in, I would have given it a one star. So despite the abundance of female cosmetic arrogance, drinking, partying & shallowness the self-aggrandizing has an epiphany with a somewhat violent resolution. And, also a small bit of intelligence, ""The real sickness here is righteousness & hypocrisy."" Females are to ""be given orders, smile, cross your legs, speak softly, be quiet, don't be difficult, don't fight back, be a princess."" They should have added, accept less, clean the house, have babies (male preferably).",Assassination Nation

This was really a positive experience of mindwrecking,backstabbing and explosive mayhem to watch,and im still a bit set out from the impressions made by this film. its academy worthy in lots of categories:filmography
editing
music
lead actress
co actresses
screenplay
light
sound
make up
directionwhat more can i say?its a few things. the way of using triple split screen are very unecesarry and negative and nearly made me shut of this film. what made me keep watching were the review by matdog 321,that gave me a thorough introduction and explonation to assassination nation,and that gave me hope for something better than the first 10 minutes should imply. my knowledge in witchology and medeval massachutnick history are like zero.so be sure ill stay away from salem when im going to new bedford next time.
i'm happy i grew up in the microwave-generation,if i were 17 today,i would for sure have struggled. also the main subject of this film are really put on the edge,but still very plausible and actual. well actually its the first time i have spontaneously screamed to a film, shouted out''beat him again'' when the main are being chased by the mob, so the revenge factor really sucked me in. i know one thing,this is a rewatch for me later,just have to let it sink in...
so if you are in doubts seeing this film i will strongly recommend it. ive experienced a few ''slow'' starting-movies through the years, what i remember as the most pivotal were the Torch Song Trilogy (1988),that turned into a teargiastic and monolithic moment in the cinema theater.

This is supposed to be a shock-to-the-system, wake-up-sheeple movie about privacy and hypocrisy, but it's just a flat-out oinker of a movie. There's just no value in it. The heroes are snotty little twits who garner your sympathy only because you know they're innocent. Nearly every scene is cringe inducing. It's a violent, cacophonous assault on logic and coherence, and it feels like it was directed by a toddler in desperate need of Adderall. It got so bad that I had to watch it on mute with subtitles.

This is a weird @$$ movie. Maybe I'm just getting too old to understand all the symbolism going on here because I like a lot of the aspects in the film-it has been described as Heathers meets The Purge. It was just a little confusing to me. There are scenes of people wearing masks but no reason why-even a kid on a tricycle. Odessa plays a teen girl-in a 4 girl group-that lives a usual teen girl's life until one day, someone hacks people's phones & computers and starts leaking private information and embarrassing photos. No one in the whole town is safe. Colman plays the principal of her school and he becomes an early target. Soon, almost everyone is hit, including students, teachers, police and even the mayor. It's the data hack from hell. Bill plays Odessa's boyfriend and Joel is Odessa's next door neighbor that used to babysit her. There is a peculiar cameo of Bella Thorne as a cheerleader-she is not one of the 4 in Odessa's group of girls. The end of the movie has a lot of blood & violence-there is one scene where Odessa is covered from head to toe in blood and it isn't even hers-which I don't have a problem with the violence but the the story goes off the logic rails. As the end credits start, there is a parade of high school kids playing their band instruments marching towards the camera but none of them are any of the stars of the movie.
It's rated ""R"" for disturbing bloody violence, language, drug & alcohol use involving teens and sexual content-no nudity except for a graphic drawing-and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.

20,Pairic,Social Media Satire & Horror,8,28 November 2018,"Assassination Nation: A Social Media Satire, Black Comedy, Thriller and Horror film in the vein of The Purge. Set in Salem, Massachusetts where once again hysteria results in a Witch Hunt just as deadly as the 17th Century events. A hacker reveals all of the Anti-Gay Mayor's information including pictures of him crossdressing and engaging with male escorts. The Mayor commits suicide at a conference. Next school principal Turrell's phone is hacked, downloads, texts and images are revealed. Some images are used out of context to smear him as an abuser.Things spiral out of control when the phones half of the town's population are hacked and their secrets are revealed, violence results when affairs are revealed and other secrets uncovered. A teen girl Lily (Odessa Young) is wrongly accused of being behind the hacks and an armed mob comes after her and her friends Bex (Harl Net), Sarah (Suki Waterhouse) and Em (Abra). However the girls fight back and a battle to the death ensues.This is an exploitation flick, a revenge thriller which doesn't spare the gore, every button is pushed as trigger warnings flash up at the beginning for every possible topic which might outrage an intersectional and even some that would trouble sane human beings. Lily editorialises on the superficiality of Social Media, about how a large amount of life is an act to fit in, especially for women.So much of our lives are online or on servers, cached, ready to be hacked. Hypocrisies revealed, how people claim to live by rules but secretly flout them. Lily herself along with her friends openly flout conventions but this doesn't help when Lily is reveled to be sexting to an older married man. When the violence erupts, Bex is a special target because she is transgender. She is targeted for lynching by the football team because on of their members had sex with her. Their members feel threatened as well.The violence is extreme at times, reminiscent of The Purge, the mobs even wear Purge style bandanas and masks.

21,TdSmth5,Some interesting ideas but overall just ugly,6,28 April 2019,"We meet a couple of high school friends who are mostly into talking about sex in person or over the phone. Not a whole lot of them are actually having sex. One day someone hacks into the mayor's phone and releases compromising kinky pictures to the entire school body. During a town hall meeting where he's supposed to explain himself, he blows his brains out instead. Next the phone of the school principle is hacked. But he decides not to resign and apparently isn't removed from his job either. When a young kid who is held as suspect is interviewed, everyone hacked phones are made public and reveals that everybody is cheating on everybody with everybody. The result is revenge and violence. Eventually a group of guys goes after the suspected hacker, one of the girls we've been following all along. At this point the movie turns into a Purge sequel with the guys donning masks and going after our girls. Of course they respond in kind leading to Hollywood's wettest of dreams, a war between men and women. At he end we learn who really was behind the hacks and why it was done.There are ideas in Assassination Nation--social criticism of the whole phone-sex culture and of hypocrisy. And the main character's speech at the end was interesting where she, once in Rambo mode, basically explains that she's the result of what the mainstream establishment has been teaching her (what all other movies basically instill): self-confidence, empowerment, you can be anything you want to be, blah, blah, blah. But the good ideas and witty remarks are packaged in a rather ugly and unpleasant package. Ugly visually, ugly costumes, ugly people. The violence near the end improves things a bit, but the predictability didn't help. Neither does the impression that movies like these often leave, that the main aim is to shock for the sake of shocking. So we get more then the usual Hollywood dose of unappealing (verbal) sex and violence.",Assassination Nation
22,I_Ailurophile,Not the movie I was expecting,8,2 May 2021,"When I first heard about 'Assassination nation,' before it was released, the premise immediately struck me as a movie I wanted to see. Of course it's taken me this long to get around to it. And I'm surprised: This was a lot more than I anticipated. It's not a parodically visceral, violent free-for-all: 'Assassination nation' is incredibly, unbelievably dark. And bloody. And really, really damn good.The first surprise: At the beginning of the movie narrator Lily (Odessa Young) gives the audience a content warning, in the dry, sardonic way a novel's unreliable narrator might inform the reader of events to transpire. In this case that notice is no joke, and it's very necessary: Content here includes misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexual assault, torture, and jingoist mob violence. And it is not fun.The second surprise: There are some very recognizable names here, which I absolutely didn't expect. Just read through the cast - Joel McHale, Bill Skarsgard, Bella Thorne, Kathryn Erbe, Jennifer Morrison. Excellent as they may be - even so, they're only support for the primary cast of Young, Hari Nef, Abra, and Suki Waterhouse, who are outstanding, and a true joy to watch on screen.And we're still not done, because another surprise is how the themes are laid bare very early. Lily's narration gives us questions about who we are, versus the version of us we let other people see. This is as true for those who hold dark secrets as for those with private lives the public simply doesn't need to see. To say nothing of hypocrisy, empathy, toxic masculinity, feminism, the problem of a directionless, future-less generation - and the ease with which we let our most base emotions take control of us and sow chaos. Heath Ledger's Joker has nothing on Er0str4tus.The narrative flow is deeply engrossing - the first third of the film is exposition, and the slow start of the downward spiral. That spiral becomes an inescapable vortex in the second act, where much of the most difficult content comes out. For the very fact of the violence and bigotry on display, 'Assassination nation' is not an easy movie to watch; we begin to wonder very early how we could possibly walk away from this feature feeling good. Yet as the final third of the film begins, Lily bloodily empowers herself and her friends, leading to some take-downs of clearly villainous townspeople that we in the audience can't help but cheer.After an angry, spiteful, truthful monologue in which Lily declares her agency, the subsequent denouement gives us one last thrill - and a last, cheeky laugh, before a sharply contrasting bright, bouncy end credits scene.It's not easy to watch, but the excellent cast makes it easier. This is true most of all of the principal cast, and special commendations for Abra, and especially Hari Nef, for both of whom 'Assassination nation' is their first major film role. I hope to see them both in many more things. Shout out, too, to Levinson and the casting directors - it's appallingly infrequent that a trans role is appropriately filled with a trans performer, so it's nice to see this is one movie that got it right.Given everything else that there is to discuss herein, the question of privacy on the Internet gets lost pretty quickly after the mayhem begins in the narrative. But there are important lessons to consider. True, it's fiction, and taken to an extreme, but this is nonetheless an example of how putting our entire lives online can be endangering. Some private matters should stay private, and that means taking steps to ensure we don't relinquish control over anything in our lives that we don't have to. And, for that matter - the control over own lives is certainly a theme here, too.There's little more I can say without broaching spoiler territory. I had expectations going in, but they were wholly upended. Writer and director Sam Levinson has crafted an insidiously dark, yet fulfilling and ultimately empowering film. 'Assassination nation' needs to be seen, and talked about, so much more. Viewer beware, for the picture is not an easy one - but don't pass up any opportunity to watch itVery, very well done!",Assassination Nation

Lacking Action 
VERDICT: Assassination Nation, gets points for its brazen, fearless addressing of the political hot topics that are hitting the media. The girls are portrayed well, subjugated to a lot of hard-hitting scenarios that will leave many uncomfortable. In addition to solid acting, the movie works well with special effects and a fast pace to stoke the chaotic fires that light up from the start of this movie. It is going to speak deeply to people who like extreme, political stand points, with each character holding some outlying personality quirk to jump on board with. 
 Yet, the movie fails to impress me because of how in your face, political warfare it is, making sure to be extremely liberal in its approaches to address all the wrong in the world. If that's not enough, for me I had issues with getting behind the characters who had little that was good about them, and seeing the dark, intense montages of stupid antics, sexual promiscuity, and drug abuse did not make for the most engaging material. As all of these aspects were blown to large proportions, the darker, gore filled edge they injected brought the shock value, but failed to add to the story. And finally, when the moment came to use that ridiculousness to make our ""heroines"" fight the good fight, the action turned into short lived, anti-climactic skirmishes that mostly looked to blood instead of moves. 
 Overall, the movie succeeds in its mission to shock you into engaging with the political qualms that this film is loaded with. If you are ready to put yourself into that setting and test your patience and character with the extreme ideas and scenes in this film, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, skip this shallow plot film and revisit a classic, because there is better use of time then the gore fest this movie is. My scores are: Action/Comedy/Crime: 5.5

25,baumer,"Without a doubt, one of the most disturbing films ever made!",10,5 October 2018,"There's two types of people in this world. People who have come to terms with privacy being dead...and the old people who are trying to fight it.Assassination Nation (2018)This is the kind of film that reminds me of why I love movies so much. Yesterday I had the option of seeing Night School or this one. I basically flipped a coin and it came up tails. Thank the heavens it did and I got to see Assassination Nation. It shocked me in every way. It reminded me of and made me feel the same kind of emotions I felt when I first watched Last House on the Left. It's a film about the dehumanization of 4 young girls. In LHOTL, it was four deranged psychotics who tortured, raped and then killed two young girls and left their bodies to rot in the deep woods. This has similar thoughts except the forest is replaced with suburbia.I will warn you, for those of you reading this, this will be ripe with spoilers. So tread carefully if you do plan on seeing the film.This is without a doubt, one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen and it scared me more than any film has since perhaps the Ring in 2002. It's a shame no one is seeing this film at the theatres and perhaps the problem is it is listed as an action comedy. A comedy? Are you kidding me? There is nothing funny about this film and it should be listed as a horror. In fact, it took third place in the people's choice award for the Midnight Madness at TIFF in 2018. This is horrific and it left me shaking even after leaving the theatre. It's not a ""dark and stormy night"" kind of film and it's not masked undead killers coming after you with a kitchen knife. What makes this scary is that this is a true reflection of the world we are all a part of and what happened in this movie could happen to any one of us.So what makes this film so powerful? Let's start with Brock Turner. Then let's mention the Dark Knight and then the Purge and Mean Girls and Heathers.When a woman claims she has been raped or violated sexually, we make them come up with oodles of proof to corroberate her claim. In Brock Turner's case, we felt sorry for him because he wouldn't get to enjoy his Cheerios in prison. ""Boys will be boys."" Poor Brock Turner might not have a shot at a real life because poor Brock Turner didn't really rape someone, he just violated her while she was unconscious. In Assassination Nation, when a hacker in the city of Salem exposes everyone's private text messages and photos and videos and anything else out there in cyber-space, the town ""loses it's mind"". When it comes out that one of the young girls, Lily, MIGHT have been having an affair with a married man, one whom she babysat for, the town, including her parents, blame her. The ostracize her, she is kicked out of her own home, she is basically branded with a Scarlet Letter. Not once is the married man frowned upon. Not once does someone speak ill of the 42 year old married father with two children.When the entire town is then hacked, people don't want to own up to their transgressions, they simply want to destroy the one who exposed them. The righteous hypocrites in small town America can't accept that they are flawed and impure. Instead they brand the young women (who are accused of being the hacker) as being home-wreckers and criminals and promiscuous troglodytes.When I think about every site I've ever clicked on, every site I've ever ordered from, every movie I've ever watched on my phone or my PC, as innocent as it all might seem, if my personal private information was hacked and exposed, how would I be viewed? There's a scene of such monumental power in this film and it's when the principal's phone gets hacked, he gets excoriated by the town's folk for being a child molester because he has naked photo's of his 4 year old daughter on his phone. When Lily defends him to her parents saying, ""Mom you have a naked photo of me when I was two sitting on the fireplace mantle, does that make you a child molester as well?""It's so easy to have things misconstrued but what makes it worse is this is none of anyone else's business. This is people's privacy that is being hacked and exposed. Think about your personal life,think about the things you do when no one else is watching. Now imagine that being exposed for the whole world to see. It's scary.David S. Goyer is one of about 25 producers on the film. He also wrote Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. All three films share similar themes and ideas. Both have ""villains"" who just want to watch the world burn. Both subscribe to the theory that injecting a little anarchy into the world is what we all need. And as the Joker says in TDK:""You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.""Those words are apropos for that movie for this movie and probably for life in general. When anarchy is introduced into this film and to the people who are in it, all hell breaks loose. And when you find out who is actually responsible for the hacks and why the person did it, they respond by saying, ""I wanted to get some LOL's"" You have a person willing to destroy lives just so they can get a few kicks.Assassination Nation is relevant, it's horrific, it's ahead of the curve and it is scary as hell. It left me shaking and it left me with a myriad of thoughts and troubles racing through my head. It's expertly written, beautifully acted and directed with style and flair by Sam Levinson. The four young actresses all give knockout performances, each one of them bring power to their characters. Bella Thorne and Bill Skaarsgard show up to give us some recognizable faces but it's Odessa Young who walks away with the best performance. Look for her in the future. I can't recommend this film enough. Like Mandy, it's not for everyone, but for those who let it all in, it might be a film that changes your life. There are shades of The Purge, Last House on the Left, Mean Girls, Heathers, Pump Up the Volume and the Dark Knight in this film. It borrows some of the ideas and expounds on them, leaving me with a film that gets a perfect 10 out of 10 from me.",Assassination Nation

I love these types of teenager movies with violence, especially because they have the potential to achieve cult like status. I liked the trailer for the film because it had a lot going for it to make it interesting. Pretty girls, sex, blood and gore, bright lights. All the makings of a film that would bring the blood thirst entertainment. Assassination Nation actually has too many problems with it and I couldn't get past it. Stylistically the film is nice but man its a wreck otherwise.The film is primarily about a group of four teenagers. They somehow manage to get center circle in a hacking scandal in their small town of Salem. This causes mob mentality and the inhabitants of the town start to show their true colors and go into a bullying and murderous rage. Why is that? Because they are intolerant, bloodthirsty, and want to kill girls who act like sluts. The main character among the four, Lily, is affected greatly by the hack and she has a target on her back. The film stars Odessa Young, Suki Waterhouse, and even Bella Thorne.The films messages are current for sure. The way information is spread, nudes and incriminating information being leaked out, police brutality, mob mentality, rioting, and the importance and dangers of social media. Stylistically, the films scenes look nice at many stages. The cinematography is vibrant and pulsing at times and it looks the part. However, all else doesn't work for me. The characters are all unlikable and you don't care about their fate. The main core of girls are not developed well at all. Suki Waterhouse's character... whats her deal? Not developed even slightly. The film felt like a brainstorming of good ideas just jumbled together with current media issues injected in it for a drug fueled mess.The high school girls all know how to shoot guns and assassinate all of a sudden? They operate shotguns and assault rifles like nothing. People in a town are all blood thirsty loons all of a sudden? Even the characters you thought were good? Okay. I know you have to suspend your belief but this was ridiculous. It strives to send out ham fisted social messages and none of it worked for me. Sorry. I wanted to like this film but needed something that would engage my brain and not have me laughing at how stupid everything was. Nice try, but no go.5/10",Assassination Nation

32,david-meldrum,Gripping Horror-Thriller With Pertinent Social Commentary That Deserves More Of An Audience,8,26 January 2021,"I've heard it said that if 80% of us were to receive an anonymous message that simply said ""They know everything. Run."", we'd obey the imperative of the final word in the message. Even if we had no idea who 'they' are or which 'everything' was being referred to, we'd assume the very worst possible and attempt to outrun the impending storm.I don't know if that has any basis in real research, but this film takes that premise and runs with it in the age of the smartphone and 4chan - and just to twist the knife a little more, sets it all in Salem, Massachusettes. Someone is hacking the secrets of first one, then a couple more, then a few more, then a good number of the population of the town and posting them for all to see. A group of girls become the target of vigilante justice, believed to be responsible for the hacks, and it spins ever further out of control. Directed with an immense visual flare that never distracts from plot or character, and a sharp script that manages to stay just the right side of too on the nose, it's a highly effective, thought-provoking and gripping film that almost literally winks at the camera without breaking the tension - and its timely social commentary never overburdens the suitably brisk running.

36,themadmovieman,A hugely entertaining horror-thriller with a provocative political core,8,21 October 2018,"From the off, it's clear that Assassination Nation won't be for everyone, what with its hyper-stylised visuals, extremely dark humour, and its passionately political core message. However, while it's not a film that manages to tie everything together perfectly, it is a hugely energetic and exciting watch throughout, with thrilling action and stunning visuals coupled with a riveting and terrifying story about contemporary culture.One of the major issues with films like this being so forward, explicit and passionate, is that it can feel a little like provocation for provocation's sake. In the opening act, the movie doesn't quite manage to get you on board as it attempts to shock you with its explosion of energy from the very start, complete with all of the so-called 'trigger warnings' you could possibly imagine.In that, it's a movie that takes a little bit of getting used to, not least because of its heavily stylised cinematography and directing, however when things really do get going, it turns into a thoroughly exciting and entertaining watch.Now, the film's representation of the perils of the internet in the modern age is an exaggerated one, while it also pushes forward with an often hyper-feminist and strongly anti-misogynist vibe, but while that may come across as simply preachy in a lesser film, the brilliance of Assassination Nation is that it ties its more exaggerated elements in brilliantly with a stunning darkly comedic vibe, allowing it to remain an entertaining watch while still having a good amount of depth and intrigue.Of course, the movie's political leanings do make it a controversial one, but with the symbolism of its story inspired by witch hunts being set in Salem of all places, furthered by that exaggerated side of its major themes, are what make it work so well, and although it's certainly a film that will divide audiences when it comes to its commentary on modern society, it's one that works absolutely brilliantly as an out-and-out horror-thriller.The first half is a riveting and very energetic social drama that places great focus on the uncontrollable dangers of the internet, hacking and waves of public anger, but it's when the film takes a ridiculous step up in its second half that things get really exciting.With that darkly comedic atmosphere running throughout, the preposterous extent to which the film pushes its story, and its symbolism of the political issues at its core, works brilliantly, and along with some stunning visuals that mix the thrills of cult horror cinema with a very modern kaleidoscope of colours, furthered by dynamic and thrilling camerawork across the board, it turns into an absolute riot of a film that I couldn't take my eyes off for a second.Director Sam Levinson does a brilliant job at bringing all those elements together, and as the dial ramps up to eleven over the course of the insane second half, the ever-growing tension and ever more chaotic story creates a palpable heartbeat and a relentless pace that makes Assassination Nation a non-stop thrill ride right to the end.Another big positive comes in the form of the lead performance from Odessa Young, who plays a teenage girl who finds herself at the centre of the chaos unfolding in Salem. While the rebellious teen is a role we've seen for decades and decades now, Young does a fantastic job at both getting you on side with her modern streak, as well as having a good degree of self-awareness to make fun of her character and generation's more ridiculous characteristics, something that plays in beautifully with the film's comedy, and makes it an even more likable and exciting watch.Of course, this film won't be for everyone, and as well as its political message being a likely point of controversy in the eyes of some, plus its immensely explicit violence (although that works very well in the context of its giallo-style final act), I feel that the fact that it is so contemporary is something that will hurt it in the long run.For the people of 2018, this is a film that speaks volumes on so many different levels, and that's what makes it more than just an insane horror-thriller, but I do feel that it's a film that will quickly become dated when new problems take hold and those represented here take more of a back seat. It still speaks about a range of important issues, but its extremely contemporary focus occasionally means it lacks a deeper, more general sense of humanity that would help it to retain relevance over the coming years.With that said, however, I really liked Assassination Nation. It's not an endlessly perfect film, and definitely not one everyone will take to, but with a passionate political core, furthered by brilliantly dark comedy, stunning visuals and direction, an excellent central performance, and a thrilling transition into all-out chaos in its second half, it's an immensely entertaining watch that you just won't be able to take your eyes off.",Assassination Nation
37,Gresh854,Very Bloody Social Commentary,4,2 January 2019,"Assassination Nation may be 2018's ""boldest"" movie, but it's also 2018's most rigorously exaggerated to the fictitious core of glorification-that thinks it's SO much more sharp-witted than it actually is-movie. Yes, it ushers up its messages QUITE CLEARLY-might I add, to the point of unalloyed obviousness-but the killing ingredient that flunks Sam Levinson's vision is it's sweepingly pea-brained script.The saving graces that heartily kept this film moderately piquant was the creditably eccentric directing and editing tactics. Moreover, the social awareness and generational traumas it shepherds among us are vastly crucial to consider for our future, but are handled in such excessively dramatized methods that it's arduous to latch onto or take any of it thoughtfully. Definitively, Assasination Nation is a bloodbath of derranged madness that doesn't necessarily justify most of its actions. (Verdict: C)",Assassination Nation
38,Bertaut,"Hilarious, disturbing, and unexpectedly intelligent - if you don't get too triggered",8,6 December 2018,"Centred around a quartet of unapologetically shallow teen girls more concerned with getting likes on Instagram than decent grades, and culminating in an orgy of gender-demarcated violence, Assassination Nation seems to set out to try to offend everyone - from the social justice warriors on the left to the second amendment fetishisers on the right, from Millennial snowflakes who have never known life without social media to Baby boomers who just can't get their head around why going viral is so important. And pretty much everyone in between. The satirical ire of writer/director Sam Levinson's second feature, however, is aimed more specifically at those who tend to see the proclivities of sexually ""aggressive"" (i.e., sexually confident) young women through misogyny-tinted glasses as the ruination of society (the type of insecure males who believe the term ""toxic masculinity"" is an oxymoron). Starting out as a commentary on a society becoming ever more defined by online hysteria and the erosion of traditional concepts of privacy, the film does run out of steam in its third act, and, overall, it tries to take on too many issues.The film tells the story of four relatively normal high-school friends, Lily (Odessa Young), Bex (Hari Nef), Em (Abra), and Sarah (Suki Waterhouse). When half of the population of their home town is hacked, and all their data made public, the quartet, and Lily in particular, find themselves at the dangerous centre of a rapidly escalating situation, as the town becomes increasingly militarised and polarised.Assassination Nation works primarily, if not wholly, by way of exaggeration, as with so much great Juvenalian satire - from the writings of Juvenalis himself to Jonathan Swift's mastering of the form, to modern novels such as Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities (1987) and Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho (1991), onto films such as Natural Born Killers (1994) and Wag the Dog (1997). The milieu of the film is not such as would be found in a piece of social realism, nor does it claim to be. Instead, it works to draw attention to various cultural aspects by way of hyperbole, embellishment, and outlandish exaggeration. Nowhere is this clearer than the film's very premise - all Er0str4tus (the hacker) has to do to destabilise the town is let everyone know what everyone else is thinking.Obviously, Levinson is not positing the story as a possible real-world scenario. Instead, he is accentuating the damage such a thing could do to highlight our society's very real obsession with social media and the concomitant importance of digital privacy. Possible to either deride the film as the worst imaginable type of excess of #MeToo, or celebrate it as an insightful examination of the origins of a fempowerment created by those very forces which led to #MeToo in the first place, it takes as its starting point the fear that female agency (particularly regarding sexuality) can instil in the patriarchal status quo ante, and then hypothesises what might happen if that fear is pushed to the extreme as men try to reassert their dominance, given the current political climate in the US. The film presents a patriarchy which firmly believes that if young women dress provocatively, they have it coming, whatever ""it"" may be. In this sense, Levinson addresses how previously frowned-upon right-wing and/or misogynist views have gained a degree of social acceptability and mainstream visibility during Donald Trump's presidency.However, the film is cognisant enough to acknowledge that racial disharmony, sexism, and toxic masculinity were not invented by Trump, positing instead that such views have long been a part of the American anthropological character, with Trump simply exacerbating and, in terms of far-right hate groups, legitimising such thinking. This has led to an American society more sharply demarcated along partisan lines than perhaps at any time since the Civil War, certainly any time since Vietnam.Levinson sets the tone immediately. The opening shot shows a camera moving along a suburban street, passing by idyllic white picket fences, Blue Velvet (1986)-style, with people performing mundane tasks such as emptying the trash and watering the lawn. Except everyone is wearing a mask of some kind. A rapidly edited montage then shows a series of quick clips, each one labelled with a requisite ""trigger warning"", including toxic masculinity, the male gaze, sexism, violence, gore, and fragile male egos. This abrasive, confrontational, self-reflexive style continues for much of the film, which is purposely designed to confront, provoke, and challenge people, not only thematically, but aesthetically.How the film deal with the male gaze is especially interesting. An early shot shows the four girls walking into school in slow motion as the camera starts at their feet and slowly pans up their bare legs before moving around behind them. You couldn't get a more textbook example of a cinematic male gaze. However, towards the end of the film, the exact same shot is repeated, but in this instance, the girls are effectively going to war, and the male gaze is no longer an issue, something the film draws to the audience's attention by replicating the form of the earlier shot - in short, the male gaze is reproduced so as to satirise and ridicule it.Another aesthetically interesting scene occurs after the data dump, but prior to people turning on one another, learning that her best friend has been mocking her behind her back, an acquaintance of the central quartet takes a baseball bat, finds her friend in the school gym, and cracks her over the head. This scene is the first act of violence from which all others will follow. It starts out normal enough, but soon the camera turns upside-down and we see the girl standing against an unrealistically large American flag. Turning the camera upside-down like this mid-shot and using the flag in this way indicates that something within the social fabric has fundamentally changed; there has been some kind of paradigm shift. Indeed, speaking of the American flag, it's a recurring motif throughout the film, but we rarely see it without a gun nearby, usually in the same shot. Make of that what you will.The film's most aesthetically accomplished scene, however, is a five-minute single-take shot depicting a home invasion, with the camera remaining outside the house, following the action as it moves from window to window. It's a dazzling sequence that has the effect of positioning the audience as passive spectators.One of the film's strengths, but also one of its weaknesses, is the sheer volume of issues with which it engages; misogyny, feminism, fempowerment, social media, sexual assault, #MeToo, bullying, gun culture, toxic masculinity, the male gaze, racism, gang mentality, digital privacy, desensitisation, mansplaining. In only the third scene, shocked at Lily's drawings of naked women in sexually provocative positions, Principal Turrell (Colman Domingo) tells her, ""this is high-school, and justly or unjustly, there are limits to what you can say,"" as she tries to argue that nudity does not necessarily have to be sexual. Adopting a feminist defence, she posits that her art is reflective of how difficult it is for women in a misogynistic selfie-obsessed social media-saturated culture, explaining, ""it's not about the nudity. It's about the thousands of naked selfies you took to get just one right.""Arising from this are a plethora of other issues. For example, firmly of the belief that privacy is a thing of the past, Lily claims that her generation accepts that their lives are for mass consumption, and all they can do is try to choose how they are consumed. In relation to this, the film addresses the myriad ways that young girls are represented on social media, deconstructing and satirising the inherently misogynistic assumptions that underpin so many of our attitudes to online behaviour (if a guy shows off his washboard abs, it's no big deal, but if a woman shows off her cleavage, we must call the elders!!)The film also asks the question of why a woman, generally speaking, cannot dress provocatively without being labelled (by some) promiscuous, all-but asking to be sexually assaulted.Unfortunately, because it tries to deal with so much, many of the issues are raised only to be touched on once or twice, and then dropped. This has the side-effect of making it seem a little thematically scattershot, and it would have worked far better if Levinson had threaded a core group through the narrative rather than jumping around as much as he does. Aside from dealing with too many themes, if the film has a defining flaw, it's that the last act essentially turns into The Purge (2013), wherein the girls, as complicit as everyone else in the early part of the film, now turn into the leaders of a righteous avenging vigilante group facing off against the intolerance born of right-wing jingoism, a conflict drawn primarily, although not exclusively, along gender lines. It's a disappointingly simplistic dénouement given the complexity and thematic depth of the preceding narrative.Depicting a cultural anxiety that is uniquely contemporary, Assassination Nation taps into something inherently new in human culture, and is an unexpectedly smart film examining weighty topics of great importance to the socio-political moment, irrespective of your political affiliation. While it is immensely strong (both hilarious and disturbing) in its depiction of teenage gender politics, gun culture, political correctness, online behaviour etc, it falters when it comes to the dynamics of the narrative, setting up several strands which never pay off, and ending a little weakly. Nevertheless, the questions it raises are important ones, and they are very well asked.",Assassination Nation
39,jdollak,"Some big problems, but still an interesting watch",5,27 September 2018,"While the trailer had gotten me interested in the premise, I came out of the theater feeling a little confused.
I was the only person in the theater, which is always a pleasant experience. It also gives me less direction about how other people are interpreting what they see.
It's hard to call this a comedy, since there was one thing - possibly two - that I interpreted as being jokes.I've had a day to sit on this, and I've come to a few realizations.
There are two scenes in this that seem like they're hitting the audience over the head with messaging. One of them is with the principal early on. The other one is a monologue near the end. The first one is more permissible, since it helps to define the lead personality, and it also gives a very sympathetic view of the principal. Once it gets combined with that ending monologue, the movie is making too hard an effort to spell out a message.I can't brag about being ""woke"" or anything, but the movie assumes that the viewer has something to learn about feminism or equality or... something. If you have none of these lessons to learn, it comes across as sort of confusing.There are a few annoyances. The direction seems far too stylized. In some cases it works, in other cases, it's too much.
It seems like some material is missing. We don't get any followup about the principal. After being kicked out of the house, where does she go?
There's a jump forward in time, and it results in things getting much worse very quickly. This works against selling the possibility of these events. Instead, certain things have to be covered in exposition, like ""why isn't the government stepping in?"" The bigger question is ""why does this town seem to exist in a vacuum?""Despite these failings, I still found it interesting, and it did raise tension. I still found myself worried about the fate of the characters.Ultimately, the ending will be a dividing point for viewers. Our epilogue scene reveals the culprit (who somehow was obvious about halfway through the movie) and someone mentions that the main character survived.
How? Show, don't tell.
But I understand - this movie has too much going into it to be handled in a single feature. Three-part miniseries would serve the ideas better.",Assassination Nation

44,TheMovieDoctorful,This Is Not A Progressive Film...,8,9 December 2018,"For as much as the advertising behind Assassination Nation was geared to appeal to progressives, this is not a progressive film in the least. This is a film that gives nobody a break. It hates adults as much as it hates teenagers. It hates girls as much as it hates boys. Above all, Assassination Nation hates frauds. It has as much contempt for its target audience as it does everyone else. While this is certainly not what I was expecting going in, and not an ideology I entirely agree with, it's certainly a welcome subversion of expectations.Assassination Nation is admittedly quite messy. The social commentary and themes don't always remain focused, several plot points that one would think would have a massive impact on the characters and story really end up going nowhere. They admittedly do give us a bit more insight into the unsubstantiality and pathos of the characters, but this is nothing that couldn't be better demonstrated in scenes that actually move the story or character development further. The live suicide of a homophobic mayoral candidate does little to the story other than reveal the judgmental, callous and ignorant perspective of the heroines (Particularly Bex) on systemic homophobia. This also significantly hurts the pacing of the film, making it much slower than it needed to be as it dwells on things it doesn't need too. The ""trigger warning"" intro is also pretty tasteless, I must admit. In the context of the film's commentary, it's basically treated as a ""trigger joke"", which I find pretty tone deaf and childish.The performances are outstanding. Odessa Young does a phenomenal job as Lily, giving her character a real sense of vulnerability, fragility and innocence in her vocal delivery that really juxtapose well with her more violent and psychotic performance near the end. Her acting in the scene where she's barbarically kicked out of her own home is particularly powerful, it comes from a place of almost disturbing and nightmarish realism. She went to a very dark and personal place for this role with one of my favorite performances of the year.Hari Neff shows some considerable potential as an actress in her performance as Bex. Much like Megan Fox in Jennifer's Body, she does an excellent job playing up the more darkly comedic and ruthless aspects of her character while still retaining our sympathy as an audience. She has an excellent screen presence and, like Odessa Young, can really go to some disturbing and personal places during the more shocking moments of the film (Her scream upon her attempted hanging is hauntingly realistic.)There are no role models here. Characters initially presented as so called ""heroes"" and ""heroines"" get slowly unraveled to be every bit as monstrous as those they see themselves so high above. They laugh at the sexual exploitation of children, they downplay rape, they smile upon the utter destruction of innocent peoples' lives, they sexually assault, they condescend and talk down to everyone around them instead of trying to understand nuance. They're ""woke"" in the most superficial and juvenile level imaginable. Wokeness to them is a fashion statement, a self rewarded badge of honor to make them feel better about their place in the world. The film is laughing at every viewer who nods their head to the ironically toxically masculine behavior and vocabulary of its antiheroines. It's a diabolically cruel and clever prank to its audience, but one that should certainly be commended.Lily is the closest thing this movie comes to a heroic character, but a role model she is not. She's pretentious, narrow minded and almost pathetically naive. She represents the dark side of social media progressiveness at its most innocent; benevolent, well meaning and well intentioned, but easily swayed by the passions and prejudices of morally self righteous ""social justice trenders."" She's a tragic figure who ultimately never finds the power and independence she so desperately seeks. As impassioned and seemingly biting as her final speech is, she is just as lost now as she was in the beginning of the movie. She's oddly reminiscent of Brendan Fletcher's Bill Williamson from Uwe Boll's Rampage trilogy; a wise and ""woke"" activist and catalyst for social change on the surface, an unsubstantial and hollow shell underneath who's utterly incapable of taking responsibility for her mistakes.The action is staged wonderfully. The gore effects are probably the best I've seen this year and Levinson really knows how to stage cinematic acts of violence. From the amusingly hyperbolic shootout near the end to Lily's visceral and personal act of justice against her attempted rapist, every action sequence in this film has a clear personality and identity to it. It sticks with you in a way the action of most Hollywood blockbusters could never dream of doing.2018 has no shortage of memorable, ferocious, energetic musical scores and Assassination Nation is no exception. This is probably my 3rd favorite musical score of the year. The grimy, nasty, combination of synth and industrial tones suits the brutal violence and utterly misanthropic tone of the movie perfectly. It's edgy, it's intense and it has one heck of a kick.No, Assassination Nation is not a ""feminist"" film (At least, that's not its main intent.) It is not a ""progressive"" film. And you know what? As much as I'm supportive of both feminism and social progressiveness, it doesn't have to be. Sam Levinson set out to make an all-encompassing critique of nearly every demographic he could. While imperfect, I must say he did a solid job.",Assassination Nation

52,seige-hound,"The Edgy Premise is Held Back, Results are Mediocre.",5,17 June 2019,"What do you get when you mix the Salem Witch Trials, Mean Girls, Spring Breakers and The Purge into the same movie? This weird but endearing mess.Assassination Nation is a highly politically charged film about four young girls who are made scapegoats by the community after a hacker leaks the personal information of almost everyone in the entire town, causing a series of violent encounters that culminate in the entire community donning masks, and torturing people to find out who the hacker is.There is a lot to like about this movie. There are some incredible shots, including a quite impressive oner about halfway through the movie, and the film does a good job at building tension as more and more people's lives are ruined by the hacker. Two of the leads are also great, specifically Lily, the main character, and Bex, the token trans woman of the group. The other two, Sarah and Em, are more forgettable. The dialogue and acting is for the most part pretty decent. The main four characters certainly act and sound like typical woke a.f. high school girls, which is great, since that's what they are.Where the movie falls short, however, is some weird choices in casting and direction. For some reason they cast Joel McHale as the main antagonist(????) and, like, why? Joel is great at playing a loveable douchebag but he seems really miscast as the creepy 40 year old sexting a teenager. Also, he's a comedian, but he barely does anything funny, and he's not even in it for that much of the film, which is super disappointing.Also, Lily's parents are absolutely awful human beings, which I guess makes sense thematically for the story the film is trying to tell, but the way events play out makes their actions some of the most inhuman and unbelievable things they could do to a person in Lily's situation. Stuff like this could have really used a few more scenes to really flesh out the parents' motivations to do the things they do in the film.(Spoilers in this paragraph)
So, obviously, this film is trying to say something about feminism and toxic masculinity. One of the main subplots of the film involves a young man having sex with Bex (the trans girl) and when the leak happens, a bunch of his friends find out and beat him up. The film's climax leads to three of the girls coming to rescue Bex, who is literally about to be lynched by the group of jocks for having sex with the guy, but they gender her...correctly?So let me get this straight. A bunch of jockish boys are about to lynch a trans woman for having sex with one of them, and they still call her 'she'? Ummmmmmmmm...ok. Look, I get that being misgendered sucks. I have trans friends, so obviously I wouldn't condone misgendering a trans person ever, but in the context of the scene, having these characters use the correct pronouns for Bex makes absolutely zero sense. I mean, if you're going to go as far as having the trans character almost get killed by a mob, GO ALL THE WAY. I mean, come on, you already put the trigger warnings at the beginning of the movie, just do it.I know it's weird to get hung up on this, but even though its acknowledged a few times in the movie that Bex (the character) is indeed trans, like the actress that plays her, at other times, the character is treated basically exactly the same as all the other female characters in this film, and my reaction to this is really mixed, because the types of issues most women go through when compared to the struggles of trans women, while there certainly is overlap, are quite different when taken as a whole. This overall leads me to the impression that while on the surface this movie is super edgy and woke, it's held back in many ways, either due to studio interference or just the director not being confident enough to go all the way.
(Spoilers OVER)In conclusion, I do think this movie is interesting and worth a watch. Give it a rent sometime if you've got nothing else to watch, and I think you'll get a bit of enjoyment out of it. I'm interested to see what else the director and actors have to offer in the future, but I'm certainly hoping it's better than this.",Assassination Nation

73,cinemawithcj,Assassination Nation - Cinema with CJ Review,1,1 December 2018,"Assassination Nation will be someone's favourite movie and I fear the day I meet them.It's a film that sets itself up to be another Spring Breakers (itself very divisive but personally a solid flick) and then slowly then suddenly falls into the realm of unlikable celluloid.All in your face and with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to a watermelon, Assassination Nation evokes groans and eye-rolls after the initial effective half hour (less if you don't buy into this online witch hunt being set in Salem from the get-go)For all it's risky filmmaking choices and interesting editing and cinematography, Assassination Nation dulls on you the moment sh- hits the fan. A place where you realise all in that moment that none of these characters are likeable or interesting enough to get you to care.It feels like you've taken Mean Girls or Heathers or some other more interesting high school movie and thought you could make it more edgy.The film screams with the voice of a teenager who has been on the internet once and has seen a cavalcade of issues in the world and just copy/pasted them into a first draft that was then immediately filmed. And with the references to hacking, it feels like it was written five years ago.Assassination Nation reeks of being the first film a young filmmaker would of made, right down to the snide reference to Fight Club and the most basic cinephile and self-aware references aping someone who's favourite director is Tarantino and just Tarantino.Which makes it all the surprising that this film is written and directed by Sean Levinson - son of Barry Levinson - but also...it makes all the sense in the world.The pure putrid world he has created full of wannabe risky filmmaking by way of The Purge if only we followed the uninteresting background actors digging the hell out of The Purge, starring four teen female leads with nothing to say except the bargain basement discussion found reblogged through Tumblr, feels exactly like something written by a middle aged white man. There's just something about the borderline exploitation of Assassination Nation that feels like it intends to be so cool and so edgy instead fills you with eye-rolls and a lack of empathy.Some people are going to really love this movie, and those people definitely have just begun their journey into film. That isn't the stance of film snobbery here, it's more the stance that when you take a step back and when you grow a little, you realise just how standard and uninteresting Assassination Nation is, full of unintentional parody and utter dullness, where everyone is a cartoon but it doesn't make any good commentary because it's literally what's happening in the world but no additional layers.Extremely harsh against women and just entirely scummy, Assassination Nation doesn't have a lot to redeem itself. You'd have more fun reading a teenager's Twitter feed while watching a Refn or Noé movie full of neon and actual interesting and deep filmmaking and theming.I just really didn't like Assassination Nation, people. It's everything I dislike about indie cinema when it goes wrong made by filmmakers inspired by much better filmmakers and not inspired enough by stories they want to tell and rather thinking the stupid message of stupid America is enough.And also it gives Jeff Winger from Community an alternative outcome for his relationship with Annie with none of the psychological journey. I'd much rather be watching that show instead of this.But then again I could say that about any film.",Assassination Nation

I actually thought this was an action movie until then. At the minute mark, there is a data leak and all of a sudden its like a post apocolyptic town where everyone is trying to kill each other because apparently everyone in the town is having an affair or sending nude pics to somebody that they now need to kill somebody for.It really makes no sense.

She, and her gang of friends, are just trying to figure out their place in the sexual hierarchy. When disaster snowballs in the form of fappening-like leaks, people start dying, and it takes off from there. The film makes no secret of its raging social justice, but is sometimes overly kinetic, and loses us somewhere between Mean Girls turning into Kill Bill. I can't say I hate it - and for pure blood aficionados, it delivers. In a story of violent tragedies, one sweet whiff of romance occurs with a transgender character and her crush - blink and you'll miss it.

One is the transgender persons secret lover and the other is shown mercy by the transgender after begging for his life. The movie feeds into all the stereotypes about white men and christian conservatives. Mob forming, the mayor ran on family values but is caught dressing in women's lingerie, the policeman is a fat, doughnut eating sexist... The main villains of course ride in a pickup, holding an American flag on each side of the bed, trolling around town stalking their victims... The only good male figures in this movie is the transgender, a black principal and an Hispanic student/athlete. This movie also attempts to normalize transgenderism by portraying one of the main characters as , ""just on of the girls"". Maybe transgender dudes hang out with girls, but I have never seen it. Finally, the movie uses the town of Salem as a backdrop to emphasize the mob mentality, but it's so over the top that it is simply not believable. Two stars may be generous.",Assassination Nation

I loved the stark reality of a lot of the comments made by characters in this film to defend their hatred, bigotry, and misogyny - without them even realizing that is what they are doing. Bigots and misogynists DO NOT realize that is what they are. To them, their actions are totally justified. While I don't anticipate anything as extreme as what happened in this film to happen during my lifetime, I think it is something that COULD happen and that does happen on a smaller scale.
Not only did this movie provide commentary on gender roles, it also tackled the pervasiveness of online media, both private and public.

The actual thought behind why the town turned on these girls is still up for debate but overall it was an interesting concept. There was many shocks and it was a film that didn't hide from many different problems concerning the world today. I believe the film also took inspiration from the Salem witch trials as they have similar aspects. The cinematography was something I quite liked however as some points the movie could have sped up. I think that this movie covers some very necessary topics and this movie will not rate very highly because society does not want the world to see movies like this. It contains topics like homophobia, transphobia, rape, sexual assault and drug use.

The soundtrack and visuals do an amazing job of setting and maintaining the mood throughout the entire film. It definitely gets an A++ in that category.The plot itself is also pretty good, with many poignant observations on the internet era we live in. Cyber bullying, meme culture, sexting and the inherent lack of privacy of today's world are all covered. Plenty of unrealistic moments but I don't think this movies point was to be deep or hyper realistic so that's okay. It gets a B- in this category.Where things start to fall apart are the actual characters themselves. While all the actors do a great job in portraying their respective characters, you won't ever really care too much them or see any real character development. Everyone in the film is just a plot device to move the story along including the main characters. Plus when you add how incredibly vapid the main cast is written to be, it ends up making it somewhat difficult to empathize with any of them for the most part..Finally, we have the final and biggest problem in my opinion. The moral leanings (or lack thereof) of the movie. After making such great observations on internet culture, this movie is incredibly ambiguous when it comes down to society itself. For a movie that starts with a literal trigger warning about toxic masculinity which it contains plenty of, the movie doesn't really examine the Mean Girl levels of toxic femininity displayed throughout. Instead choosing to go in a direction of a nihilistic faux female empowerment fantasy that may ultimately do more harm than good for the young, gullible and uninformed viewer who are most likely to enjoy this movieAll-in-all the movie was incredibly watchable and may even be good for a re-watch or two.

Everything in this film is over the top and surrealistic, and yet somehow captures ""Trump's America"" perfectly. I wish it were not the case, but I can honestly see almost this exact thing happening for real one of these days in the not too distant future.The trailer and marketing campaign make it pretty clear what you're getting yourself into by seeing this, and if that's what you're looking for then you definitely won't be disappointed. This is a very graphic film in both the language and violence, but every bit of it is necessary in order to portray this story the way it needs to be told. I'll be honest, the first hour actually drags a little and you may find yourself feeling uncomfortable and even bored once or twice, and it takes a while for things get going, but when they do finally take off, they reach heights you'll have to see to believe.I highly recommend this film to anybody who can stomach it, but be warned, it may just turn the mirror back on YOU.Good watching",Assassination Nation

Yes I'm posting spoilers because 90% of the people that read this aren't going to see the movie anyway. If you are planning to see it, good, I highly recommend it! This is not a movie about teenage angst, which was the impression I got from the trailer. Ten minutes in, when I saw Bill Skarsgard, Anika Rose and Joel McHale, I got really curious, why would they sign on to this little indie teeny bopper flick? 15 minutes in when I realized one of the lead characters was transgender, I was reeled in. This movie is about America. How our society is being overrun by ""mob mentality"" and how those who realize it is wrong, choose to sit quiet and literally let people DIE rather than stand up and risk the mob turning on them. This movie is about America and how misogynistic it is, how intolerant of ANYONE that is Different from what ""they"" deem to be normal. Who are ""they"" you ask, glad you did. ""They"" are White Males, who assert their power & privilege and turn a blind eye to their own wrongdoings. They persecute others for doing the same things that they do. When they are caught in the wrong, i.e. in this movie when the hacker exposes personal information, they don't own their faults, instead they seek to villainize those who exposed them...sound familiar? OMG this sounds racist but it is not, if you know me, you know I'm not a racist but these are the facts that America was built upon. If a woman is assaulted by a White man, she did something to deserve it and she is vilified as a whore while society seeks a way to ""save"" him. If someone is not a standard heterosexual, they are demonized and attacked, while straight White men justify all of their immoral, sexual proclivities with ""We are Good People"". Parts of this movie were painful to watch, I literally almost walked out twice, just the brutality but also the frustration because this is our reality! Some of the staging was really ""in your face"" but by the end of the film I realize that they had to exaggerate to get the point across, to get me to see how I too buy into the stereotypes. At the end of the day/movie, the person who was revealed to be the real ""villain"" was, of course, a White male teenager. When asked why he did it, he responded ""For the LOLs"".
I love the empowerment of women in this film, I love the strength shown by the Black characters, I love the fortitude shown by the young man pressured by his football team to do the wrong thing. This movie is excellent. It is time for the White Men of America to realize that they are not superior to any other sex, race, religion on this earth.",Assassination Nation

125,coopermcdonald-52056,"Aesthetically Pleasing, but Not a Great Story.",6,3 April 2020,"Assassination Nation centers around a quartet of unapologetically shallow teen girls more concerned with getting likes on Instagram than decent grades. Lily (Odessa Young), Bex (Hari Nef), Em (Abra), and Sarah's (Suki Waterhouse) lives are turned upside down when half of the population of their home town is hacked, and all their data made public. The quartet, and Lily in particular, find themselves at the dangerous center of a rapidly escalating situation, as the town becomes increasingly vicious and desperate.
Assassination Nation works primarily with exaggeration, as with so much great Juvenalian satire. The milieu of the film is not such as would be found in a piece of social realism, nor does it claim to be. Instead, it works to draw attention to various cultural aspects by outlandish exaggeration. Nowhere is this clearer than the film's very premise - all Er0str4tus (the hacker) has to do to destabilize the town is let everyone know what everyone else is thinking.
Director Sam Levinson sets the tone immediately. The opening shot shows a camera moving along a suburban street, passing by white picket fences of a normal suburban town, with people performing mundane tasks such as emptying the trash and watering the lawn. Except everyone is wearing a mask of some kind. A rapidly edited montage then shows a series of quick clips, each one labelled with a requisite ""trigger warning"", for various scenes filling the film, including Bullying, Blood, Abuse, Classicism, Death, Drinking, Drug Use, Sexual Content, Toxic Masculinity, Homophobia, Transphobia, Guns, Nationalism, Racism, Kidnapping, Murder, Attempted Murder, The Male Gaze, Attempted Rape, Sexism, Swearing, Torture, Violence, Gore, Weapons, and Fragile Male Egos. This abrasive style continues for much of the film, which is purposely designed to confront, provoke, and challenge people, not only thematically, but aesthetically.
An especially, aesthetically interesting scene occurs after the data dump, but prior to people turning on one another. Learning that her best friend has been mocking her behind her back, a friend of the central quartet takes a baseball bat, finds her friend in the school gym, and cracks her over the head. This scene is the first act of violence from which all others will follow. It starts out normal enough, but soon the camera turns upside-down and we see the girl standing against an unrealistically large American flag. Turning the camera upside-down like this mid-shot and using the flag in this way indicates that something within the social fabric has fundamentally changed.
The film's most aesthetically accomplished scene, however, is a five-minute single-take shot depicting a home invasion, with the camera remaining outside the house, following the action as it moves from window to window. It's a dazzling sequence that has the effect of positioning the audience as passive spectators. It is clear that while not a particularly fun film, Levinson did have a lot of fun in the creation of it. Between these interesting camera shots and angles and colorful set and costume design, the film is extremely aesthetically pleasing.
Aside from those already mentioned, this film tackles a ton of problems young girls are facing everyday over social media. For example, firmly of the belief that privacy is a thing of the past, Lily claims that her generation accepts that their lives are for mass consumption, and all they can do is try to choose how they are consumed. In relation to this, the film addresses the myriad ways that young girls are represented on social media, deconstructing the inherently misogynistic assumptions that underpin so many of our attitudes to online behavior (if a guy shows off his washboard abs, it's no big deal, but if a woman shows off her cleavage, she can be considered a slut).
Unfortunately, because it tries to deal with so much, many of the issues are raised only to be touched on once or twice, and then dropped. This has the side-effect of making it seem a little thematically scattershot, and it would have worked far better if Levinson had threaded a core group through the narrative rather than jumping around as much as he does. Aside from dealing with too many themes, if the film has a defining flaw, it's that the last act essentially turns into ""The Purge"" where the girls, as complicit as everyone else in the early part of the film, now turn into the leaders of a righteous vigilante group facing off against those who seek revenge for their privacy being made public, a conflict drawn primarily along gender lines. It's a disappointingly simplistic ending given the complexity and thematic depth of the preceding narrative.
While it is immensely strong (both hilarious and disturbing) in its depiction of teenage gender politics, gun culture, political correctness, online behavior, etc, it falters when it comes to the dynamics of the narrative, setting up several strands which never pay off, and ending a little weakly. I am rating Assassination Nation at a 5.9/10.",Assassination Nation

127,matdog321,What are you doing on IMDB?,9,22 September 2018,"Assassination Nation is a ""modern"" take on the Salem witch trials, which, coincidentally takes place in Salem. Once a hacker starts exposing deep secrets from the townspeople ranging from the mayor to the principal to the students, all hell breaks loose. And when main protagonist Lily along with her 3 girlfriends are blamed, they find themselves fighting for their lives. I loved every minute of this film, the cinematography was not only stylish but necessary, avoiding borderline pretentious arthouse that leaves you feeling robbed. If you are going in for the violence, you won't get much of til half way into the film, but when it does come, it is a very satisfying and adrenaline filled rush. That's not to say I didn't feel exhausted from this film by the time we reached the last 5 minutes, but only because this story took quite a bit to spiral out of control that by the time sh*t hits the fan, you are left feeling quite full with what you are fed in the final act. I say this because if you are expecting those 4 girls to absolutely obliterate a whole mob of angry people, you will be disappointed to hear that the film ends before we see that carnage, but what you do see is fulfilling enough to forgive that cliche copout, which is why I take one star away from an otherwise perfect film. If you are the type of person that thinks 4 girls talking about male genitals and whose nude pictures they have on their phones, you might be a bit annoyed with our leads. But as for me, I loved every second they were on screen. Not to mention the polarizing use of modern trap music and the booming bass constantly playing in-between scenes and in the background that compliments the 4 girls aesthetics, whether they are simply walking down the school halls or doing something mischievous that will ultimately have consequences by the time things start going south. I ask you why you are on iMDB because, it's not that this movie is some ""snowflake"" SJW horror film trying to bombard you with the words ""trigger warning"" but that it is very political and seeing how the Purge movies are received, I highly doubt this movie won't take a beating from a few bothered people. Enjoy this movie for the hilarious and disturbing outcome of what happens when a paranoid town resorts to gory violence. You may walk away feeling pleasantly surprised",Assassination Nation

133,XE_Kilroy,Dark Twisted Entertainment,5,30 October 2021,"This movie is a hidden gem. Engrossing from start to end, never a dull moment.It's kind of a modern take on the Salem witch hunt but with a little 'girl power' oomph. It's risque, a lot of violence and sexuality to it, but in a thoughtful artistic manner. It's got that kind of Scott Pilgrim vs The World style to it (not quite, but similar) -- fast-paced, edgy, cool shots, cool costumes, cool characters, split screen, words on screen, narration, etc. But there's also a lot of awesome cinematography, shot composition, and long elaborate tracking shots that are so seldom used these days.The story revolves around a typical small town in the USA that is turned upside-down and inside-out when an anonymous hacker leaks everyone's saucy secrets. The town turns on itself when that fragile facade of normalcy and decency that a community hides inside starts cracking at the seams. It's easy to work out who the hacker is, but you don't even think about that during the movie, so it takes you by surprise. It's such a rollercoaster ride that all your focus is on following the events as things devolve.It's not heavy drama, but there are messages. It's superficial and vain, but it has depth and style. It's a 'pop trash' type of movie, but so well thought out in terms of story-boarding and such. Cinema of high-end technique.The writer+director is son of acclaimed Barry Levinson, so the pedigree is there, well-versed in film making, grew up around it all, great feel for how to write engaging scenes, how to segue, etc. Will be interesting to see Sam's career evolve from this early landmark.",Assassination Nation

136,rorymarsh00,21st Century Exploitation,8,21 October 2018,"Sam Levinson's 'Assassination Nation' is an interesting beast. It contains themes and attributes from a multiplicity of genres, but ultimately asserts itself as an exploitation film, using modern fears about data protection and amping it up to eleven. The narrative is fairly straightforward, a series of events resulting in a one man (or, four women) vs. the world scenario. Whilst this story is tried and tested, the characters and direction help this film stand out. Each of the four protagonists are written with such a legitimacy rarely seen in similar films, teenage girls talking as teenagers would, rather than how an older writer perceives them to be, grounding them in reality, a base that is definitely required in contrast with the absurd plot. All the actresses give stellar performances, and their chemistry becomes the lifeblood of the film. On the flipside is Levinson's directorial eye, which proves unique and unabashedly in-your-face, with fragmented party sequences, a technically mind-boggling long take, and an elasticity within the camerawork that is somewhat unrivalled by anything in recent years. Whilst some films of this ilk build tension through dialogue or within the score, Levinson's visuals prepare you for the madness to come. There were certain aspects of the film which will cause it to become dated rather quickly, its references to Twitter and Instagram preventing it from becoming something timeless, however, for what its worth, its message is extremely contemporary for the here-and-now, whilst Levinson's directorial eye will help preserve its lifespan as a likely cult favourite. The term 'cult film' has many facets. As a result, many people will actively dislike this film. At times it is overly gratuitous or even nasty, with the majority of its protagonists unlikable, but intentionally so. If, like myself, you enjoyed it, then these will be no bother, however, if you reject any of these features, it is likely you may give up on 'Assassination Nation' before its conclusion. From my perspective, there were few places where the film faltered. The pacing could become a little slow in the second act, with the set-up completed, it felt more a precursor to the third, rather than a continued progression, and the eventual outbursts of violence, whilst cathartic, could have been pushed yet further, Levinson's camerawork largely straying away, rather than embracing, besides from a particularly gnarly shovel scene, to which there was audible applause from the audience. Furthermore, the frequent inclusion of social media-centric iconography and soundbites grew wearing at times. Besides this, Levinson's film is a brilliantly executed exploitation film, with a unique visual and narrative direction. Like many similar films, some will hate it, however, those who don't, are likely to love it instead. 'Assassination Nation' is here to tell its story, and to be honest, it doesn't really care what you think.",Assassination Nation

138,Proactivity,Worth a watch if you're young and open minded,7,30 November 2018,"People have always had secrets. Secrets from their partners, secrets from their parents, and from their friends. People have had private conversations, secret diaries, private photos, and have shared them with people they trust. Everyone has private thoughts and interests, some of which they may never tell anyone, and if you could read people's minds then you'd probably see them in a very different light.Today's teenagers have grown up in a world where most of this exists, is created, stored, shared and searched for online or using technology. Technology and search histories that can be accessed by people with the right knowledge and wrong intentions.This film inhabits that world through the eyes of teenagers. It will probably feel real and relatable to people of a similar age, and alien to older generations. When characters have their data hacked and publicly shared, people react strongly and loudly, quick to denounce them and deliberately misconstrue and twist the details to vilify the victims, even though they know they're probably no better themselves. The exposure and public shaming feels like Twitter played out in real life with unfiltered anonymous comments and death threats replaced by actual weapons and fire.Unfortunately the end of the film goes off the rails, trading realism for slick action and unbelievable retribution, but if you're able to suspend disbelief and see past this then it's an interesting reflection on today's young and society. It's also refreshingly inclusive, with a couple of trans characters who are never treated differently to the other girls, even by the aggressors.The first minute of the film warns about the blood, gore, death, and everything else that may trigger the more sensitive souls.

156,chris60,"Astute, Apropos and On Target",9,25 September 2018,"Art reflects society. When society grows divided and divisive, art will reflect it, and such is the case with Sam Levinson's ASSASSINATION NATION. As with Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in 1972, (now ranking in the top 100 films on most critics' lists,) it's decidedly not a movie for everyone. ASSASSINATION NATION goes places uncomfortable and apropos, and does so in spectacular, over-the-top fashion.PEW Research cited a staggering 94% of all American teens wielding social media as of 2015. We tell these teens that all nudity is inherently sexual and that their strongest natural urge is to be shunned, all while blatantly using it to sell practically every product on the planet. Some of their private divulgences, then, naturally contain nudity. As a legal repercussion, we've arrested and charged girls as young as thirteen with Felony Pornography Production for unwisely sending their boyfriends topless pictures - pictures these indiscrete boys shared with their entire schools and beyond. For added trauma, as hacking of social media grows more sophisticated, so, too, grows the broadcast of stolen photos and missives.We inexplicably shame women who've been wronged - women whose privacy has been violated, women who have been raped - and excuse males, saying, ""Boys will be boys."" We give boys a free pass and a pat on the back, be they aspiring athletes or nominees to the Supreme Court. But oh! My mistake - Brock Turner actually served three months of a six-month sentence for raping an unconscious woman and leaving her behind a dumpster. No free pass there, though some bemoaned how ""sex offender"" status would hurt Turner's promising career.Take a country where women have traditionally been treated as Second Class, achieving the right to vote only after a nearly 100-year unmet demand and not assuming control of their own bodies until fully a half-century after that - where marital rape wasn't declared illegal across all states until 1993, where equal advancement, and equal pay, for equal work is still out of reach for many, and you have a recipe for angst.Next, introduce a manipulative political party (unashamedly gerrymandered a 33-seat gain in Congress while losing by 1.4 million votes in 2010) that pairs bible-banging righteousness with cascading hypocrisy to roll back hard fought rights women gained and ensure others are never achieved. Then, ice it with a philandering leader who has publicly called women ""pig,"" ""dog,"" ""cow,"" ""slob,"" and ""disgusting animal,"" a man who elicits and validates the very worst tendencies... and you have the recipe for an explosion.ASSASSINATION NATION takes a bloody hard look at where we are, lensing women's societal issues through a contemporized frame of the Salem witch trials. Some couldn't see past the violence committed by Alex and his droogs and condemned A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and so will some be repelled by the violence and avoid ASSASSINATION NATION.

Beautifully shot scenes, 4 beautiful teenage girls, beautiful sound track, and strong dialogue (especially from Lily and, to a degree, Bex). That covers the first 30 minutes or so. Then someone decided ""Okay, let's turn this into a cheap horror B-movie now."" Why?! The murdering frenzy the town gets itself into, is way over the top -- ridiculously so when even the sherriff, of all people, is egging on (Salem's) lot.Would peeps get upset when someone was hacking their private stuffz? For sure; but most of them (especially the ones with the darkest secrets) would not be marching the streets, parading their sins, as it were, but rather try and hope for it to go away as quietly as possible. The ensuing mob is forced, and, at no point, ever feels like this could be a real thing. The wife of 'Daddy' (a handle which, in itself, is a little too obvious) getting angry at Lily, lashing out at here, that is plausible -- the rest of the 'gang' is not.And speaking of 'Daddy', Lily starts off explaining her relationship so well, as if taken from real life, what with him being the only person who truly seemed to care about her and all. Not the sort of situation you'd want to see your own daughter in, of course, but a realistic scenario nonetheless. And then, when we get to the B-movie part, all of a sudden he turns out to be an entirely freaky perv (who, incidentally, apparently has a murdered girl lying around in his bathtub). Again, why?! As a moralistic warning that young girls shouldn't get involved with older men?! (Mores Lily actually rails against, towards the end, when she says a society should either live up to its high morals, or simply abandon them, when they feel they're too rigid).All-in-all, still a watachable flick, but part of me feels that, by the latter half of the film, you're just eating into the goodwill the movie accrued during the former half.",Assassination Nation

170,michaelscoughlin,"Take the older teens, but not the kids.",7,22 September 2018,"""Assassination Nation"" is one of the most bizarre and violent teen movies you will ever see. Its also brilliant. When I first saw the trailer it looked like it had some good ideas, But that it had no sense of what to do with those ideas. Seriously the trailer is a complete mess and somewhat incoherent. But I saw the high scores from critics and audiences alike (on another site, not IMDB) and even though the film does feel a little chaotic at times, it does have focus and all the chaotic is part of the story and makes absolute sense when viewing the film. It is kind of like ""Mean Girls"" meets ""Natural Born Killers"" with a little ""Heathers"" and ""Kids"" thrown in to the mix. It also reminded me a little bit of ""Pump Up the Volume"" a forgotten teen masterpiece. It certainly isn't for everyone and should probably be Rated NC-17 considering its target audience. Seriously if a parent took a child under the age of 13 to see it, it would be child abuse in my opinion. And I thought ""Fahrenheit 11/9"" was going to be the most controversial and political film I was going to see this week. Lolz. What was I thinking?",Assassination Nation
171,kolumbo,"Entertaining, but flawed",4,13 April 2019,"The gist of this film is this - Doesn't matter what your age/gender/sexual orientation/race/beliefs are, we're gonna ""trigger"" you. And you know what? They do. That's fun, and actually a pretty smart move in order to divert the audience from realizing the flaws, biggest of which is the plot.It starts out well enough and hooks you, but as soon as, uh, the whole ""Salem witch hunt"" begins, it instantly falls flat and is uninspired, dull, and played ridiculously safe until the end. Which is the opposite of what the film wants you to think about it, which is just kind of sad.Not all negative, though, of course. The editing is great, the soundtrack is amazing, and everything up until it falling flat is, overall, really entertaining and well done. Obviously the team behind this film knows what they're doing and succeeded in making this flawed script entertaining for the most part. And, hey, if you don't care about the plot at all, then it's a 10/10.Simple, if you want some mindless entertainment to kill an hour and a half, this is it.

172,chrisgarcia-26913,Unexpectedly good,7,3 November 2019,I liked this more than I thought I would it was actually entertaining and the thought of all of your private texts and search history being released was interesting. The main girl is kind of annoying but not too bad that the film is unwatchable. The violence was cool too. My only real problem was it ends without us knowing the fate of the main characters and the motive for the culprit of the leak has a really stupid reason for causing all of the chaos and the movie doesn't explain at all why he would do something so messed up to his own sister. Still entertaining though.,Assassination Nation

This movie has a stunning tempo . Acting is superb and the camera work reminds me a lot of La Grande Bellezza.
This currently rates under 6 stars but having just seen it I would say this rating actually belongs to the characters in the film if you can imagine the empathy it stirs in viewers. Oh yes - and if you're not used to bloody scenes, this one is not for the faint hearted! .In it's class (high school action-drama) it is a disaster, with monologues getting hugely philosophical and hermetic as hell.

180,shahriarrahmanshajib,The first Sundance Hit of 2018,8,26 January 2018,"First off, I am stoked to be the second person on IMDB reviewing a film that is sure to blow up! Judging by the date, I probably saw this film at the same Sundance screening as the previous reviewer. With its $10 million sale at Sundance three days ago, this movie is sure to get a theatrical release this year, and deservedly so. It may even win the Dramatic jury prize at Sundance in a few days. My mind is dizzy right now with thoughts I want to express about this film - so I will only stick to the essentials. Let me start with this: this ""little"" film (cheekily dubbed as a ""true story"") about the breakdown of the small town of Salem, Massachusetts, will stir up national debates about internet transparency, morality in the digital age, toxic male egos, gun culture, and teenage online delinquency. And that is just scratching the surface.This is a film that can be assaulting on the senses with plenty of teenage sex, gun violence, and excessive blood. This shit is not for everyone, especially viewers over 45. Really, I am a bit overwhelmed. I will say that the story hits a home run. In our heroine, Lily, we find a character arch that begins with strength, then vulnerability, fear, despair, and then finally renewed strength. It is classically Aristotelian in that way. The technical execution is something to behold, with one breathless technocrane/steadicam (step-off) shot - showing with heart-pounding grace how thugs ambush Lily and her friends in a house. The price of admission is worth this scene alone.My biggest critique of the film is that the last one-third of the film differs in form or genre than the rest. Though I am sure this was a deliberate choice which helps the film be entertaining to its targeted youthful viewership, I also feel that this tactic may keep the film from making any lists of great cinematic achievement. The first two-thirds of the film is a gripping tapestry which includes music-video aesthetics, split-screens, driving dance beats and youthful energy - rife with empathetic sensibility. The second half is completely devoid of any empathy in a balls-to-the wall grindhouse or revenge story featuring babes with shiny red jackets enshrouded by guns and seemingly impervious to bullets. Also, enough blood and killings to make you think you are seeing grindhouse B-film from the 70's. What this film does startlingly well is that the audience is willing to let itself be immersed by the lack of empathy and incredulous violence in the last act because by this point the director has earned its trust with the gripping story and the sympathatic plight of the main characters. That Sam Levinson the writer/driector made us make this jump with him is a stroke of --I will say the word-- genius.",Assassination Nation
181,emjr4,Great under rated movie,8,15 June 2021,"I'm surprised this movie only has a rating of 6, yes it's not the best movie/story line but it is brilliantly shot and also deals with a lot of real world problems. It was enjoyable to watch and shows how close to the brink our society is.It was also consistent and wrapped up all the storylines, yes it was a bit of leap to get to the villain of the story, not going to spoil it for you, but the fact everyone believed that person could be behind it was probably the most frustrating part.Apart from that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Got a bit dark in places so that is a warning I should leave you, but if you can handle the more extreme movies nowadays then I would recommend this one.",Assassination Nation
182,shelbrahhh,Lowkey wild as hell,8,22 March 2019,"I didn't really know what to expect when I watched this but I looked up ratings before and set the bar low. I was pleasantly surprised that I really enjoyed it.
I can see how some people wouldn't like it from the dialogue because it is very modern but I think that it depicts a real view of how most teenagers and young adults think and talk in 2019. Also, another thing I see people talking about is the fact that it's unrealistic. It's a movie. It's fiction. It's an imaginary world. That's what makes movies so cool, am I right?
But I don't see how people can deny the fact that 1. The acting is great. Like I said, I set the bar low going in and I was looking for things that made it a bad movie. But I can honestly say that the acting wasn't cheesy and unconvincing at all. 2. The cinematography was done very well and there were some standout moments where I was like, this has its own unique style. I was impressed. 3. It was gory and shocking as hell and I think that it's hard to pull off that level of shock factor nowadays. 4. The message! I loved it. And I think a lot of people could benefit from hearing it and thinking on it and applying it to their own life.
For the last half of this movie, my mouth was on the floor. I definitely recommend.",Assassination Nation

It is different than expected in many ways: no full carnage by the main characters, but some brutal violence out of the blue. No great story, but some nice turns that make up for the absence of it.The reason I gave this film 7/10 and not lower, is because it kept me interested the whole way and some chills because of the (okay, infrequent) awesome shots (combined with great music).The reason I gave this film 7/10 and not higher, is because of the many missed opportunities.

188,BlueSensual,A pseudo-feminist persecution complex training video,1,3 November 2019,"Token, vapid and underwhelming. Made me hate women my age even more. I hate men as well, but for other reasons than what is relevant to this film.The characters are all as sexually narcissistic as the ones in the series GIRLS; which is unwatchable. One of the first scenes, in the film is a series of watchwords flashing on the screen, as a ""trigger warning"".I had no idea what happened in the baseball bat scene; I wish it was more graphic. Most of the drama I couldn't understand because we don't know their personalities and motivations.The yellow text was sometimes unreadable cause the background was too light as well. Not a good stylistic choice, in my opinion. The low phone recording quality at the beginning was also bad and served no purpose.The reason initially did not give it a one star rating is because Bill Skarsgård, and he was delectable, as always. Then I later realized, not even he could save this film from my final judgement.Also, I liked the part where his character, Mark, confronted the conceited protagonist after she humiliated him in front of her friends. It was neat that he confronted her after he found out she cheated on him; it was about the most just part of the film.As for the message; forget it. It does not reflect real life, hence it's not satire. It can't be ""funny cause it's true"" because it's not true. This overly dramatic ugly exaggerated drivel is a pseudo-feminist persecution complex training video. Millennial and gen-z ""queens"" and thxts will love this film.",Assassination Nation

190,jensmurer,Ups and downs and lows,5,18 July 2019,"The gist is already here in abundance: Beautiful visuals, could have started a good twenty minutes later into the movie, a bit gory in act 3 and those last stand-offs seemed.... weird.
But what took the better part of those five stars I'm redacting is simply that the twist is blatantly obvious. Everyone there should have come to this conclusion. I mean: Right away. Straight after the waterboarding. The theory, that the girl did it, shouldn't even leave that small group in the bathroom.Okay, I'll just hit ""Spoiler"" and vent:Even if that little brat wasn't presented as any kind of hacker who could do that sort of thing and even if you couldn't deduce somewhat of a connection from the first victims, three things were missing from the movie and missing for the reason that it would have destroyed the whole plot of ""Everyone thinks it was the girl"":1. Lily cries over the phone, that she would never do something like that. But really what she and everyone should have said was, that she COULD not do such a thing. Sure, they tried to set her up as some kind of ""wunderkind"" because she draws naked people in art class and could go to any college she wants, but we don't see her doing anything on a technical device but sending nudes to a man more than double her age. Why would anybody even consider her to be the hacker?2. Not even in this half-rape-scene when she thinks she's in a safe place the man asks something like ""Why did you leak that stuff about us?"". And with good cause. There would be simply no reason for her to leak anything about him.3. In all this hate and chaos nobody sets out to harass Lily's family. At least their windows should get smashed. Or the father (being set up as the torn character) should get a beating while shopping. The tone of the movie calls for the big guns: a raid of the house, the mob beating the mom up (satisfying for the viewer for she abandoned her daughter), tearing the house apart, getting Lily's laptop and so on. Nothing of that. Why? Because it would've taken away the twist. They would have found her pink Laptop and the boy-cave of her brother.Conclusion: The movie is based on a lame twist which is protected by stupid plot holes.Great visuals and camera work, though.",Assassination Nation
191,kirtimandas,A trashy rip-off of The Purge,5,11 December 2018,"To put it best, this movie has no clear ideas of its own. By the end, a girl who acts like a s*** throughout the movie throws the blame on someone who started the trend of girls wearing inappropriate clothes unaware that she has been doing the same all the time and giving an excuse of just ""going with the flow""! The ideas were those which you have sent countless times before, don't misuse the internet and all that, but just because there is moderate ultra modern music and lots of Gore doesn't mean we are watching something new. The lead actors have no clear idea what to do, and just like any modern teen movie, they act with supreme confidence when they are talking that infuriatingly irritating talk filled with expletives, and also go limp during times of crisis.

193,elijahhall,Just wow...,10,22 March 2019,"I was a bit sceptical when a YouTube trailer of this popped up, but after watching it I thought to myself; maybe it's actually good. And yeah, I've never seen anything like this before. Sure, there's been similar movies, but so much violence and chaos just adds a little bit extra to the plot.I've always wondered why there's so much hatred towards people for loving someone with the same gender. It kind of threw me off when they attacked the mayor over something so little. I get that the old world talks about a man and a woman living together and getting kids and so on. And that the Christian way of living is just that, and it's all just a bunch of BS. People should enjoy life and it's many ways with who ever they want to.I was also shocked when the principal got called a pedophile because he had pictures of his daughter taking a bath naked. I don't know what kind of universe those people are living in, but I usually bath without clothes. Is it weird to keep those pictures? Yes and no, I'm not gonna talk about that cause clearly people just assume other things. As for his porn searches, nothing weird there, pretty much my entire 'previously viewed videos' on my favourite site. Simply cause I don't wanna search for something and end up watching a 40 year old woman everytime I wanna see something special. And also, who doesn't watch porn, like come on!The whole vibe and method of dealing with this exposure felt a little extreme, I don't think anyone would start murdering random people because their life got hacked. But I get the idea of it. Would I be embarrassed if my conversations and pictures got leaked? Sure, but it wouldn't be the end of the world, it's not like I haven't sexted with anyone in the past and sent pictures of myself to several people. We're born naked, and we get dressed and undressed when we die. It's a natural thing!Guns do prove something very real though, the accessibility of weapons in general is still an issue. I get the second amendment and all that, but it's over 200 years old, when law wasn't a big thing. It's now and I think guns should be banned for civilians. Either way, cool with guns and all.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, it was funny, a little sad and captivating. I sat down to watch this and play some games, but I quickly realised that the movie was too good to multitask.Watch it, it's really good!",Assassination Nation

208,malloryvinson1,Trigger Warning,9,29 September 2018,"Underneath it's shocking violence and lurid visuals and dialogue, this movie actually has been sticking with me long after seeing it in the theater. The only thing I had known about it going into it was that it was described as a Heathers meets the Purge, and this description is fairly accurate. But it also has a unique quality to it that I found shockingly wonderful, and it gets a lot of its plot elements from an imagined modern day Salem witch trials. The acting was excellent and thrilling. Odessa Young's voice overs were chilling, but Hari Nef stole the show as Bex. Bill Skarsgard did his creepy thing as the abusive boyfriend, and he did it well. All in all I was thoroughly impressed with the messages the film was sending. It highlighted the ways in which women are still treated in what we like to think of as our modern-day, ""sexism-free"" world. And it did it in the most brutal, visually stunning way. Please be advised that if you are easily triggered by violence against women, rape, and relationship abuse that this may not be the film for you. I am not generally too bothered by these things but this movie had me writhing in extreme discomfort practically the entire time. As we left the theater, I remember thinking ""I don't know if that was one of the best or worst movies I've seen,"" best because of the surprisingly deep message and attention-grabbing visuals and music, and worst because it was so hard to watch.

It blames all the murder on things like fragile male egos, the male gays, transphobia, etc. The movie ends up focusing more time on pushing it's political agenda than developing a compelling narrative or making us feel connected with the characters.",Assassination Nation
222,kimberlysyrnyk,"This is worse than the current ""climate emergency.""",1,31 October 2019,"I was so excited to see the killing and gore. I wanted to see all the action. I made it 14 minutes in before I turned it off. It's the worst propaganda I've ever watched. I'd rather listen to Justin Trudeau's re-election speech on a loop for 1 hr 48 mins.
Do not recommend.",Assassination Nation

224,danmcginty,started well ended badly,3,4 November 2020,"At first it was promising. highlighted all the violence and sex that was going to happen throughout the movie.
After watching i was left disappointed. very predictable. the purge meets thirteen and kill Bill.
I enjoyed the first half of the movie with the edgy teen drama tone and the whole data leak scenario was clever but it was like they changed director and writer half way through the making of the movie. its left me stressed out!",Assassination Nation
225,soulthlives,Horrible.,3,21 September 2018,"The movie tries to be rather super open minded but it feels fake and disconnecting to the realism of it all. Also the girls try too hard to be mean and rude, and honestly it makes me not want to root for any of them. I get it. Teenage girls aren't sweet and nice, and honestly? Go for it but really we're supposed to like these girls? I can't find a single thing great about the fact that they are rude, spoiled, and honestly hypocritical. The movie also tries way too hard to call out stupidity white hetero situations but also can't really pick a side of being a book feminist or just being a sexually liberated feminist. Which you don't have to pick, but apparently to them. You have to pick one. Don't see it. It's not worth it, it's obviously a bad movie and it just tells us the whole issues of singular midwestern christian white towns. All full of want to be like Los Angeles but no one wants to really listen what the Angels are saying.",Assassination Nation
226,neotristan,"Prepare for discomfort and discourse, and a really great film",10,22 September 2018,"I enjoyed this film sooo much. It was terribly triggering in a lot of important ways, I was uncomfortable for much of the film and was engaged the whole duration of the movie. The friendship between the protagonists was fantastic, and I've never seen high school girls portrayed in such an honest and positive light. Also, the way the movie was shot and edited for at least the first 4/5 of its run was incredibly interesting, with multiple frames showing different characters' simultaneous experiences and other novel film techniques. Some scenes were so intense and graphic but the feats of acting performed by the actresses made it feel organic and connected me to the moment. Super enjoyable, and intense, and as unsettling as it was because of its resemblance to life. Go see it",Assassination Nation

230,monkeyluv-03759,Definitely Not For Everyone,8,29 December 2018,"Me personally thought this movie was really good! I can see why some people might not like it with them being the older generation and not really there taste. But it was feminism to the max it really made women and girls stand out and stand up for there right. Definitely don't watch this with your parents! Just the right amount of chaos, sex, gore, and drama. It was like the purge on steroids with guys against girls. I only gave it and 8/10 because it was a little slow in the beginning but over all a great movie!!",Assassination Nation
231,vanjahamdahl,Great movie,9,3 September 2019,"I was entartained all the way through, beautifully shot, great soundtrack, exiting visuals and most of the acting was great too. This is partly satire so some of it is over the top, obviously... It of course brings up relevant questions about privacy/the internet etc. but it's also cool to watch it just to have a good time. Would definitly reccomend. Good job Sam Levinson👏🎉",Assassination Nation
232,skrull-55465,People missed it ? Many laughs for sure,9,8 December 2018,"The trailers are missleading about why the town goes crazy and those criticizing the movie for how they didn't understand it are wrong. Apart from this point the movie is impressive, many incredibly well-filmed scenes + a strong message presented with a Black Mirror like style. You surely wouldn't expect that much from this kind of apparently uselessly gore teenage movie !",Assassination Nation
233,trezalmighty,I'm Warning You... it's HORRIBLE,1,15 December 2018,I have nothing but bad thoughts everytime I think about watching this bootleg asz purge... it's so fvckn trash that in my entire life this is my first time going to leave a review ON ANYTHING.. I tried to give them a zero star rating but it wouldn't let me so I have to say something bout it,Assassination Nation
234,pleasehelpamanda,Amazing themes and great filming,9,22 December 2018,"I've read a lot of negative reviews for this movie. My guess: close-minded people who can't see the forest through the trees. The overarching themes of this movie are outstanding! Are there self-indulgent teens who make me feel grateful I never had children, absolutely. Not the point. The point is explicitly stated at the end of this brilliant and self-indulgent film. Don't have the patience (even though the story is not boring by any stretch of the imagination) to stick it out to the end? Well, I guess that's your loss.",Assassination Nation
235,nraasch-17436,Loved it,10,5 January 2019,"I'm a teen so for me I loved this movie. The topics they talk about are so relatable. Everything was made so interesting and left me thinking later after the movie was over, reflecting on my own life. Sometimes the scenes get pretty gory and the things that happen might be blown out of proportion a bit but over all I personally really loved this movie.",Assassination Nation
