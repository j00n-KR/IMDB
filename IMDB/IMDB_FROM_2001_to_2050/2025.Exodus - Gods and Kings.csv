0,bkoganbing,No Passover viewing treat,6,19 May 2015,"It has become somewhat fashionable to dismiss Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments because of the arcane Victorian era dialog. But I have to say that Ridley Scott's version of Exodus while technically proficient will never become the Passover viewing treat that DeMille's film has become. Cousins Moses and Ramses are friends and rivals for the affections of the Pharoah who is Ramses dad. But when it is discovered that Moses is actually the son of Hebrew slaves that his mother Pharoah's sister drew him out of the Nile the succession of the Pharoah's line is secure.What's not so secure is the kingdom itself as the Hebrews who came over as a family of 13 kids several centuries earlier now are in the thousands and are slaves and they ain't happy about it. In the funny way things work out in life, the adopted Egyptian prince is in fact the promised leader who is going to lead them back from whence they came which is Canaan.In DeMille's version the dialog may be arcane, but it is also uplifting and inspiring and delivered by the ultimate DeMille leading man Charlton Heston. Yul Brynner as Ramses in that version was the arrogant Pharoah enjoying all his princely prerogatives. They made an evenly matched pair of foes and with them scrapping over Anne Baxter the conflict got personal as well as religious.Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as Ramses just don't give you people you can identify with.DeMille was always good with crowds. Note how uplifting the liberation of the Hebrews is in his film. Also the small little vignettes of the various people in the crowd. They are a family/nation in his version. All they are is in Scott's version lumpen proletariat.Whose idea was it to have the voice of God be that of a petulant child? Instead of the pyrotechnical wizardry of DeMille the Ten Commandments are given almost matter of factly by a kid to Christian Bale.We've gone beyond Cecil B. DeMille in the art of film making. But there a things in his craft that he was the top, far and above anyone else. Not even a Ridley Scott should try.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
1,SnoopyStyle,technically sound but adds little to cinema,6,13 May 2015,"It's 1300 BC and 400 years of enslavement for the Jews. Moses (Christian Bale) saves Ramesses' (Joel Edgerton) life in a battle with the Hittite. Prophecy suggests that Moses would become the leader. Moses' true origin is revealed and Ramesses becomes leader after his father's death. Moses had discovered Viceroy Hegep's corruption. Hegep reveals Moses' secret to Ramesses and Moses is sent into exile. After having a family, God sends him back to Egypt to lead his people out of slavery.There are some minor differences from 'The Ten Commandments (56)' that explains the human interactions. Ridley Scott brings the big action. There are great actors doing good work. In the end, this is simply another version of the epic with some changes. It is technically sound. The pace is uneven with some very slow sections. It doesn't add anything to the story or cinema. It can only redo some of the iconic special effects. It doesn't dive into Moses' personality. It tries to make him more human and less icon. It's not as compelling. It leaves me wondering why this movie needed to be made. This movie is made to be forgotten.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
2,Prismark10,Let my people go,4,20 January 2016,"The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston was a big biblical epic. Ridley Scott has gone for breakneck speed, CGI and decided to add realism to the spiritualism.Christian Bale is flat as Moses the battle hardened half brother of Joel Egerton Ramses II who leads the Egyptian empire and the vast army of Jewish slaves. Moses realises that he is in fact a son of a Jew and decides to lead his people into freedom.The film has four writers and two of them are known for script fixing but this is an undercooked drama from the director of Gladiator where the special effects are fine but the story just leaves you nonplussed.For example the plagues are well utilised but the parting of the waves and the carving of the commandments are underwhelming. Scott suggests that some of this events were inspired by nature rather than be mystical. Crocodiles causing the river to go red by being snappy with their victims, frogs leaving the blood red river onto the land where they died and which bought in the flies. The parting of the sea might had been a freak weather inspired tsunami.However it is the characters that never register with actors like Ben Kingsley foundering with weak characterisation.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
3,nogodnomasters,WE CROSS HERE,6,13 September 2018,"This review compares the film to the biblical text and as such may contain ***plot spoilers***. The opening starts in the unknown years of Moses (Christian Bale) between Exodus 2:10 and 2:11. He is the brother of the Ramses (Joel Edgerton), son of the Pharaoh (John Turturro). The incident of killing the Egyptian is downplayed. Moses is exiled (did not flee) more due to prophecy. They created a scene where he discovers his true lineage, something that the Bible glossed over.His encounter with ""God"" was with that of a child, one might think was a hallucination. Indeed future encounters show Aaron (Andrew Tarbet) spying on Moses as he talks to himself, while Moses believes he is talking to God. Moses carves the 10 Commandments by his own hand as the little God looks on. His conversations with God is not what is recorded in the Bible, except for maybe an ""I AM.""Moses does not return to Egypt with his wife (María Valverde) and son (Hal Hewetson) as one would gather from the Bible (Ex 4:20) which created the need for a reuniting scene later in the film.The Red Sea parting was a ""huh"" moment as the waters seemed to have simply subsided. The return of the water used cyclones and was more of a scene.Christian Bale played a more subdued Moses, perhaps a man who suffered from hallucinations caused by an injury.Clearly Bible believers will like this film about as much as the rock creatures in ""Noah."" In an attempt to make this a ""historical"" film circa 1300 BCE, the film creators unknowingly point out chronology problems. If the goal of the viewer is to watch a film of ""could of"", ""maybe"", then this film might have some appeal, unless one looks too deep.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
4,kosmasp,Bible lesson,7,11 June 2015,"Of course, if you know your Bible you already know where this is going. But if you like very good CGI work on monumental movies, you could be in the right place here. Christian Bale did draw some controversy with his terrorist suggestion/remark when he promoted the movie (especially from some Christians who thought he was way out of line), but his role seems a difficult one to pull off.Even without knowing the Bible, you will see where this is going. Best friends who kind of are in a competition and probably are not on the same page all the time. The acting is really good and the violence is sometimes surprisingly vivid/explicit. It might turn off some people, just be aware of that fact.It's a big movie and it tells a story of oppression, that the viewer can get behind. The violence is a different thing, something even Moses is questioning at times (and other character). The movie also tries to be vague about a couple of things, which will not float right with some Christians as well. A difficult movie but very well made indeed",Exodus - Gods and Kings
5,rmax304823,"Colossal, Stupendous, Magnificent, Titanic, Formidable!",6,13 August 2016,"It's not surprising that they should remake ""The Ten Commandments"" every few years. It's got everything an epic should have -- persecuted people, pageantry, heroes, villains, a couple of magic tricks, and it ends with a catastrophe. What a narrative! It has other advantages. Commercially it offends no one. The Jewish faith is still with us, and there are no more ancient Egyptians to write angry letters to the Times. With the progress of time, more and more impossible things can be more and more convincingly displayed on the screen. For lagniappe, everybody knows the story of Moses.Christian Bale, as Moses, gives a muted performance, which is okay because the part requires self abnegation rather than pompous speechifying. In either case the performance would be dwarfed by its monumental surroundings. You think Cecil B. De Mille parted the Red Sea? Wait till you see THIS part.Nice supporting cast too, though most aren't on screen for long. Sigourney Weaver and John Turturro are unrecognizable but Ben Kingsley is the patient and determined leader of the Jews and Joel Edgerton is an all too obvious antagonist as Rameses. As soon as we see the handsome young Bale and the skin-headed scar-faced Edgerton on the screen together as friends, we know all we need to know about who's who. But just to make sure -- prudently, so to speak -- there is a glimpse of Edgerton in battle with the Hittites when he freaks out with fear and is revealed as a shivering coward. I don't remember that from the Good Book, but okay.Not bad. What's missing is what's missing from almost all films in the ""action"" and ""horror"" genres. For some reason the images must be dark and murky. Where is all the SUNSHINE of the Middle East? It's enough that the basis of the story is Jewish, must it be bluish as well? Anyway, it's still a stirring tale. You'll probably enjoy it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
6,ma-cortes,"Impressive Biblical epic , co-produced by USA/Spain/England and spectacularly shot in Spanish outdoors",7,11 January 2016,"Exciting rendition about the Biblic leader who led Jews out of Egypt against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses , setting 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape . Spectacular as well as long running story produced/directed by Ridley Scott with all-star-cast . Biblical and evocative tale that deals with Moses , the Hebrew lawgiver . Evocative adaptation about known story , it recounts the greatest Bible story ever told , a journey through the Holy Land that focuses Moses (Christian Bale) , the Hebrew leader , leading the Jews out of Egypt and realized in Hollywood style . This is the wonderful story about an extraordinary man receiving a holy calling , and follows his life from his stand in pharaoh Seti (John Turturro) court , slavery and trials in leading the Jews ; this is one of the greatest events in epic motion picture history . Biblical story developed in on a great scale though no such as the classic Cecil B. De Mille's version . An Egyptian prince named Moses who is adopted and brought up in the court by an Egyptian princess and learns of his identity as a Hebrew and later his destiny to become the chosen deliverer of his people . This vivid storytelling although fairly standard follows appropriately the Moses'life , the son of a Jew slave , from birth and abandonment on a basket over river Nile , as when the Pharaoh ordered the killing of all newborn babies , being pick up by Egyptian princesses and he's raised in the royal court , becoming into Prince of Egypt . As Moses embarks a supernatural mission , as the Egyptian Prince , learns of his true heritage as a Hebrew and his divine mission as the deliverer of his people , getting the freedom for Hebrews . When his Hebrew origin is revealed , Moses is cast out of Egypt , and makes his way across the desert . Then , Moses retires out of Egypt where meets Jethro , marring him with his daughter Zipporah (Maria Valverde) . The stoic Moses along with his brother Aaron (Andrew Tarbet) and Joshue (Aaron Paul) confront Pharaoh Ramses (Joel Edgerton , though Oscar Isaac and Javier Bardem reportedly turned down the role) . Moses asks Pharaoh to liberate them but he refuses, causing the Egyptian plagues : invasion of locusts , fogs , epidemic , water become in blood and death of the first-born . At night , the angel of death comes , and passes over the protected doors of the Jews . As the death angel kills off the first born children of Egypt, including Pharaoh' son . Moses takes charge of God's people and wrests them from Pharaoh's punishing grip . Moses like liberator of the Jewish leads his people throughout desert battling enemies and with holy intervention . This is a monumental version of the Biblic book of ¨Exodus¨ with great production design by Arthur Max ; being carried out in utter conviction and breathtaking special effects by means of groundbreaking C.G.I. , including the parting of the Red Sea . The production team formed by Sebastián Álvarez , Denise O'Dell , Teresa Kelly , Soliman , and Michael Schaefer conferred with roughly experts to make the film as spectacular as possible and including ample participation by various screenwriters as Bill Collage , Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian who worked together Scott in Hannibal (2001 and American Gangster (2007) . Obviously changes were made to the story to make it work as a Biblical feature , in fact , there is a short list of differences between the movie and the Biblic account of the Exodus . Serious acting by Christian Bale who plays a sober Moses . Secondary cast is frankly good , such as : John Turturro as Seti , Aaron Paul as Joshua , Tara Fitzgerald as Miriam , Ben Mendelsohn , Ben Kingsley , Sigourney Weaver , Massoud as Grand Vizier, Indira Varma as High Priestess , Ewen Bremner , among others . Glamorous and luxurious costume design by Janty Yates . Colorful cinematography by Dariusz Wolski filmed on location in Spain : Canary Islands , Fuerteventura , Almeria and Morocco . Special mention for sensitive and thrilling musical score by maestro Oscarized Alberto Iglesias . This movie was one of the most expensive epics ever made at the time , 2014 . In fact , it is one of two big budget films based on the Old Testament to come out in this year , the other one being Noé . However , watching in TV it makes lost most really overblown scenarios on the small screen . This Hollywood blockbuster , filmed in 74 days , was professionally directed by Ridley Scott ; being suitable for family viewing and religious people , though it was was banned in Morocco and Egypt . And dedicated to Tony Scott, Ridley Scott's brother who took his own life in 2012Other adaptations told in compactly form are the followings : classic mute (1923) by Cecil B. DeMille with Theodore Roberts , Rochefort ; the second handling and the greatest , made in a gargantuan scale by Cecil B. DeMille (1956) played by Charlton Heston , Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter , Debra Paget , John Derek , Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price . Furthermore , a TV recounting by Gianfranco De Bossio with Burt Lancaster , Anthony Quayle , Mariangela Melato , Ingrid Thulin ; and a new take on titled ¨In the beginning¨ (2000) by Kevin Connor with Billy Campbell as Moses , Christopher Lee as Seti and Art Malik as Rameses ; animated rendition (1998) titled ¨Prince of Egypt¨ produced by Dreamworks and directed by Simon Welles . And a television rendition (2006) by Robert Dornhelm with Dougray Scott , Susan Lynch , Naveen Andrews , Paul Rhys , Linus Roache , among others",Exodus - Gods and Kings
7,Quinoa1984,Exodus: Effects and Lack of Emotion,5,27 April 2015,"It's not any one thing especially that is particularly so wrong with Exodus: Gods and Kings, but an overall gloom and doom that befalls the film, the deadly serious tone, that keeps it from reaching to a higher plain of epic-filmmaking existence. Scott takes this tale SO seriously, indeed, that he has things like a stern-faced child as the voice of the ""I Am"". Which is fine, except that there is nary a moment of any kind of other emotion from this child actor throughout than of whining. At least when Scorsese had a child as a 'God'-like being in Last Temptation of Christ it was for a shorter period of time, and for a more specific purpose. If there was a point to be made about this child as a ""God"" - perhaps as his way of criticizing religion as the God of the Old Testament being a brutal eight year-old - it could have had an impact... if the rest of the film around it wasn't so thuddeningly dull.Why is this so dull? When you have this much money at your disposal, you got to try to make as much of a HUMAN connection, to make the drama really stand out (this was something another filmmaker in 2014, Aronofsky with Noah, actually understood and really made palpable and intense amid the spectacle). Or, go the other way into broad and campy material. Scott is just there to shoot a lot of this much the way he did Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood - in other words, substitute out the pyramids with colisseums, or castles, or other things, and you'd have similar hyper-kinetic action (sometimes but not always too fast) and actors who are well-trained and versed and there to do the work, but not much more.Actually, those other films, even Robin Hood, would be preferable to sit through again than Exodus. There's just no joy or excitement to the filmmaking; the closest part where it really gets engaging and exciting and full of 'Wow' material are the plagues. Those work well, just as eye-candy. People in the cast like Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton, as Moses and Ramses respectively, are giving it their all - or as much as the script is asking them too, which is pretty similar relatively scene to scene (Ramses rarely is anything other than a ""God""-type d***head). But other actors are completely wasted amid the scenery and effects: Sigourney Weaver, Aaron Paul, Ben Kingsley, they're only there to look on with awe and ""huh"" moments, or deliver exposition glumly. Ewen Bremmer, of all actors, as the sort of court-jester-summarizer of the plagues steals the show far as supporting players go.It's all just flat, monotonous story-telling, and for all of those moments - that mid-section with the plagues - that are visually striking and cool-looking, there's still not much investment with the characters. We know how this will play out, but what do Scott and his screenwriters do to add anything extra aside from that been-there-done-that ""lived-in"" dirty quality? Uh... extra violence (albeit just up to the line of R-rated)? An opening battle? For all of the intensity of the two main actors, and the tremendous special effects, it's practically wasted on a story that is 90 minutes shorter than DeMille's 1956 Ten Commandments, feels long and sluggishly paced - this despite the fact that certain other characters who could add some human dimension (like Moses' wife) are underdeveloped and under-utilized. Just put the actor there, prop-like, shoot, go on with the next scene.Where's a good 'Golden Calf' sequence when you really need one?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
8,michaelRokeefe,Ridley Scott's Biblical epic!,4,29 December 2014,"This is Ridley Scott's retelling of a Biblical event that is heavy on the mascara, with over-bloated battle scenes and not much effort paid to Biblical accuracy. But then again, this is a movie where a lot of money changed hands to entertain as many viewers as possible. As I left the theater I couldn't help but notice frowns and grumbling from the oldest viewers, while the younger generation seemed wild eyed...and Wow, man! The defiant leader Moses(Christian Bale)rises up against Ramses(Joel Edgerton), the Egyptian Pharoah. The two men, half-brothers, at one time had each others back in battle. While we always thought that Moses fought along side the slaves and instead of fighting to escape Egypt...600,000 weary slaves are forced to leave. Of course we know that there is the wandering trek in the desert, parting of the Red Sea and presentation of the Ten Commandments. Alright, it happens here, but it is more easily to get concerned with the special effects, which are pretty darn good. The locusts, frogs, blistering disease, hail stones and the devastating waves of the parted sea.Plus try and wrap your head around the ""movie making"" of having God appearing as a young boy that can only be seen by Moses. And it always seems that Joshua(Aaron Paul)is there to eavesdrop on their conversation. It doesn't take long to realize you paid to watch a mess.There is no mistaking that Bale gave his all. Edgerton worked hard as well, but a bit hammy. The supporting cast features: Ben Kingsley, Ben Mendelsohn, Isaac Andrews, Maria Valverde, Sigourney Weaver, Ewen Bremner, Indira Varma and Hiam Abbass.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
9,sunwarrior13,The Lastest Version Of The Ten Commandments,6,17 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is an epic film by Ridley Scott that was inspired from the Holy Bible particularly from the Book Of Exodus.The story taken from the part wherein Moses led the Israelites out of slavery from Egypt.It stars Christian Bale as Moses together with Joel Edgerton, John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Ben Mendelsohn, Sigourney Weaver, and Ben Kingsley.The movie tries to wow the crowd with state of the art visual effects as it tells the story of a defiant leader in Moses.He rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Rameses to free the Israelites out of slavery but the two into a battle of stubbornness that results in several plagues.The death of the Pharaoh's son results into the freedom of the Israelites in the end.The parting of the Red Sea and the 40 year journey of the Israelites towards the Promise Land consist the later part of the film.Two words describe the film:very disappointing.No question that the so-called remake of the 1956 epic The Ten Commandments was a disaster from beginning to end.There are many reasons for it.First of all,the epic was crammed into 145 minutes instead of telling the whole story for 180 minutes of the original Cecille De Mille epic.This resulted to the lots of unevenness in the pacing of the story as some events moved quickly that the viewer would even not get the emotional impact of the events particularly the plague.Also,the amount of visual effects used somehow diminished them as well.Christian Bale is a talented actor.Too bad that he never made Moses into a memorable and larger-than-life character.While Joel Edgerton wasn't convincing at all as the Pharaoh and emotions and sympathy towards the death of his son won't be felt at all.Their head-to-head clash simply did not elevate the interest as the story moves forward.Finally,the worst part of it is that portrayal of God.This was absolutely a mistake of having a child which made Him annoying and a petty presence which made it extremely difficult especially for viewers who are looking forward to the big part He has to play in the story.The only positive thing about this is it is visually impressive.Nothing more.Too bad that the filmmakers focused too much on them rather than the characterizations and the emotional impact that it should have on the viewer.Sad but true.Overall,the film hinges from being bad to average that it will never be at par with the other Biblical epic and probably even be considered as a forgettable film about Moses.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
10,Theo Robertson,Confused And Very Mixed Messages,6,4 April 2015,"For some inexplicable reason 2014 was awash with religious tinged cinema . We had that one where Kevin Sorbo played a parody of an anti-theist , another film that ripped off Christians by being nothing more than a History Channel mini-series edited together in to a feature film , NOAH which while being very entertaining seemed to upset a lot of people because it wasn't based on the true story of the Bible . I think they meant that snakes didn't talk therefore there's no way it could have been true . And the very end of the year Ridley Scott jumped on if not the band wagon then at least a very fast chariot and brought us EXODUS which was something of a flop critically and commercially Now Ridley Scott is something of a curious case . He's someone who is a perfectionist who wants to get everything right but by doing so he can't see the trees for the woods . His films are good but I don't think he's made a film that exalts him in to legendary status . There's another aspect and for many years now he's closely associated with making historical epics . It's nor Mr Scott's fault and probably it's the studio system to blame , after all if they want a movie set in New York then they'll make Scorsese an offer he can't refuse and so it's the same with Ridley . It does show a lack of imagination by everyone involved but I did enjoy PROMETHEUS for the most part so decided to catch this one I can't remember much of the biblical story of Moses but did notice much of EXODUS resembles GLADIATOR . There's a massive battle where Egyptian general Moses saves the life of Ramses the Pharoah in waiting and soon this respect for one another soon gives way to animosity because the story requires it similar to Maximus and the Emperor in GLADIATOR and while being reminded of that film I was also constantly reminded of the director's KINGDOM OF HEAVEN from about ten years ago . To give Scott his due the production values were good and all the money is up there on screen and the performances are never jarring with Australian actors Joel Edgerton and Ben Mendelsohn being the pick of the impressive cast What let's this film down however is that there's several screenwriters . One must be an anti-theist , one an agnostic , one being a happy clappy vicar and one must be Pat Robertson hiding behind a pen name . I really can not communicate in words how utterly inconsistent the narrative is here . At least with NOAH it wore its heart on its sleeve that it was a Paganistic environmentalist fantasy and not an out and out Biblical story much of the story in EXODUS leaves an ambiguous interpretation that Moses is deluded and isn't in contact with God but this seems contradicted by other scenes where God does exist . For example it makes a very intelligent scientific argument that the catastrophes that fall upon the Egyptians are simply caused by nature which I found fascinating that blows away Biblical myth but again the story starts contradicting itself in that certain events could only have happened by the intervention of a supreme being controlling all the laws of physics . There's even a scene where Ramses proclaims ""Your God kills children"" which is fair comment but remember Ramses is the bad guy and Moses the good guy and I doubt if we're supposed to be taking the side of Ramses in anything . It seems unlikely any moral ambiguity is meant here and everything is shrouded in confusion . There's several scenes where the Hebrews train at fighting while being slaves of the Egyptians and considering Ramses has been using spies throughout the movie up till this point no one seems to have noticed this guerrilla army in training . You really do get the impression the screenwriters have written their own vision of the story and the producers have for some reason kept everyone involved in the process happy by refusing to delete any internal contradiction in the screenplay I'll be the first to admit I'm very biased when watching films featuring religion . If it's propaganda I'll review it as propaganda but I don't doubt the Bible has some good stories - but that's all they are , fictional stories similar to Aesop's fables from Greek myth . Something like EXODUS I will watch simply as a film fan who wants to be entertained and to be fair EXODUS is moderately entertaining but by trying to appeal to to atheists , agnostics and Christians it's the sort of film that will appeal to no one simply because it has a badly written screenplay trying to take all sides",Exodus - Gods and Kings
11,LeonLouisRicci,God-AwfulThe Crocodiles Steal the Show,4,8 July 2015,"Flat, Lifeless, Colorless, and sometimes quite Boring, this Ridley Scott retelling of the Story of Moses, God, and the Freeing of the Hebrew Slaves from the 400 Year Bondage in Egypt is Disappointing Dreck. The Film Struggles to become something, anything, and Never really manages to be Entertaining, Enlightening, or Engaging. It almost seems that every Creative Decision the Director made was a Misstep.Christian Bale as Moses is Distracting and all but Detached from the Proceedings. He Never looks Heroic or Inspirational even when He is Shouting Battle Plans and Crossing the Red Sea. The Middle Section with the 10 Plagues is the Best part, projecting the Blood Scourge as something Devastating. Here the Film Surprises, but Nowhere Else.The Anachronisms abound, the Casting seems off, the Script is Corny, and the whole Thing is Heavy Handed and Hardly Intriguing. The Movie tends to Twist and Tweak things but Not for the Better. It's Juvenile in its Clunky Playfulness with the Scriptural Mythology. Darren Aronofsky's Noah (2014) wasn't that Good, but this is even Worse.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
12,CinemaSerf,What do the entrails say? Exodus stage left...running...,6,30 June 2020,"I'm not quite sure what went wrong with this; so it might be better start off with what went right...? Someone, Sir Ridley Scott presumably, had watched Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) and thought that it could do with a bit of a refresh; hell it worked for Peter Jackson! Let's get onto Nina Gold and see whom she can find... three minutes later they elected on Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as Ramses II with a supporting cast of Sigourney Weaver (Ramses' mum); Sir Ben Kingsley (""Nun"" - no, not as in Mother Theresa) and John Turturo as the Pharaoh Seti (who was reputedly both wealthy and wise, so what was he doing in this?). Only Ghassan Massoud (Grand Vizier) came anywhere near convincing anyone in his portrayal, otherwise this is really just an unashamed rip off of De Mille's far more classy versions with enhanced digital - not necessarily better - special effects. What is interesting is the manifestation of Jehovah as the young boy and the imagery of the plagues sent against the Egyptians is presented in a potently gruesome, grizzly fashion. The rest of it is long, fairly run-of-the-mill and I struggled to see where the alleged $140m went.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
13,zardoz-13,"Great Scott, Ridley!!!",5,15 December 2014,"Nobody has made a landmark Biblical movie since Mel Gibson helmed ""The Passion of the Christ"" in 2004. Mind you, contenders have cropped up, primarily ""Noah"" (2014) with Russell Crowe, but it amounted to little more than a pretender with its apocryphal allusions to the Books of Enoch with its stone angels. ""Son of God"" doesn't really qualify since its producers re-edited it from The History Channel miniseries ""The Bible."" Sadly, nothing about director Ridley Scott's ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" appears divinely inspired. Scott, best known for lavish spectacles such as ""Alien,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Black Hawk Down,"" and ""Prometheus,"" has spent $140 million on this sprawling recreation of ancient Egypt. Admittedly, Scott doesn't qualify as a saint. In a recent New York Times interview, Scott said about ""Exodus,"" ""I've got it fairly well plotted out. I'm an atheist, which is actually good, because I've got to convince myself the story works."" Not surprisingly, the secular screenplay credited to four scribes, among them ""Tower Heist"" duo Adam Cooper & Bill Collage, ""The Constant Gardner's"" Jeffrey Caine, and ""Schindler's List's"" Steven Zaillian, adopts a realistic rather than a scriptural slant to its subject matter. Moses behaves more like Rambo rather than Charlton Heston, and our hero discovers with considerable chagrin that he isn't an Egyptian. Comparatively, ""Exodus"" neither takes its cues from Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 or 1956 versions of ""The Ten Commandments"" nor Mel Gibson's subtitled ""Passion of the Christ."" Certainly, nobody would expect anything less from a luminary like Sir Ridley Scott, whose last two films—""The Counselor"" and ""Prometheus""--excited as much as mystified audiences. Traditional believers may judge ""Exodus"" a questionable expense. For example, when Moses initially encounters God on the side of a mountain after a mudslide, the former finds himself dealing with an eleven-year old boy who reads him the riot act. Later, during a subsequent confrontation with this obnoxious urchin, Scott presents the interview from two perspectives. Again, Moses is conversing to a child. Meanwhile, Joshua eavesdrops on Moses, but all Joshua sees is Moses addressing a rock with nobody present in either human or divine form. Sure, this resembles the movie ""Fight Club"" (1999) where narrator Edward Norton argues with Brad Pitt, who turns out all-along to have been nothing but Norton's hallucination of himself. If this kind of nonsense doesn't bother you, you may enjoy ""Exodus,"" but I think that depicting God as a petulant punk undermines the gravity of the film.Basically, ""Exodus"" duplicates virtually everything that DeMille showed in his two ""Ten Commandments"" outings. The venerable saga concerns oppression and intolerance. The Egyptians are proud and powerful, while the Jews are poor and powerless. Moses appears and pleads for the release of his people. Predictably, the Egyptians with their architectural enthusiasm for worshipping themselves with massive monuments balk at turning the Jews loose. Ramses and Moses remain at odds until God intervenes with ten deadly plagues that make Ramses into a believer. The Egyptian ruler releases the Jews, and they head off for Canaan. A vindictive Ramses has second thoughts and decides to pursue Moses and his minions. The big showdown occurs at the Red Sea where Moses waves his staff and the waters recede just long enough for his people to cross. Along rampages Ramses with murder on his mind and his army, but he doesn't arrive in time to take his toll. Instead, the toll takes him. This is the stuff of which Sunday school lessons are taught and most movies about the event have depicted. Scott takes exception to several things. He doesn't include the adolescent years when Moses and the future ruler Ramses were playmates. When ""Exodus"" unfolds, Moses and Ramses are adults and rivals to the throne. Of course, Ramses' noble father Seti (John Turturro of ""The Big Lebowski"") thinks that Moses has a better head on his shoulders than his petulant son and confides as much in Moses. Unfortunately, Seti points out that he cannot appoint Moses over his son. This relationship resembles a similar relationship in Ridley Scott's earlier epic ""Gladiator"" (2000) when the dying Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) preferred Maximus (Russell Crowe) to his repellent son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) for the throne. During a savage war with the Hittites in 1300, Moses displays his martial ardor and saves the once and future pharaoh from certain death in battle. Moses serves chiefly as Seti and Ramses' adviser. In other words, he does all the dirty work with which neither wishes to soil their hands and clashes with a corrupt Viceroy Hegep (Ben Mendelsohn of ""Killing Them Softly"") who reveals Moses' genuine origins as a Jew. Moses goes into exile and bids farewell to Ramses. Ramses' mother Tuya (Sigourney Weaver of ""Alien"") isn't as content as her son to let Moses off as easily and sends a pair of fiendish assassins to finish him off.""Batman Begins"" star Christian Bale and ""Star Wars"" actor Joel Edgerton generate neither chemistry nor camaraderie respectively as a militant Moses and a ramrod-straight Ramses. Scott and his scenarists want us to believe that these two grew up together in the same house, but they share little in the way of brotherly affection. Bale's Moses relies more on the sword than the staff, and this differentiates this cinematic interpretation from Charlton Heston's Moses. Scott surrounds these two with a robust supporting cast, including Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Aaron Paul, Ben Mendelsohn, and John Turturro. Sadly, they make only a minor impression. Mendelsohn registers best as the slimy villain who gets his just comeuppance in the final reel. The spectacular computer-generated imagery and the craggy scenery—lensed in Spain and the Canary Islands--qualify as top-drawer assets. The film generates some unforgettable moments during the ten deadly plagues montage, particularly when the crocodiles crunch on fishermen. Clocking in at a leaden 150 minutes, the lackluster ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" fares far better as a special effects extravaganza than a faith-based bonanza.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
14,grantss,Weak on so many levels,4,5 October 2015,"Weak on so many levels.Directed by Ridley Scott, the story of Moses and his leading the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt. Starts with him being an Egyptian Prince and follows his story until after the parting of the Red Sea.Not quite the Cecil B DeMille version of Moses... (for reference, see The Ten Commandments, 1956). While the story of Moses is taken from the Bible, Ridley Scott chose to make this movie as secular as possible. Fair enough: you want to draw in Christians and non- Christians alike - there's more money to be made that way! However, in trying to avoid references to God as much as possible the whole story becomes contrived, fake and, well, silly. For example, the boy that appears to Moses from time-to-time is clearly meant to represent God (though, Biblically, God didn't appear as a boy and why would He?). But at no stage does Moses call him God or the boy admit to being God. Even when Moses asks who he is, the answer is ""You know who I am"". So instead of direct references to God we have this weird, mysterious double-talk and obfuscation which just comes off as very lame.It's not just in the dialogue that things get a bit silly. In the plot as well, Scott tries to replace the works of God with natural phenomena and, once again, he can't pull it off. The famous and iconic parting of the Red Sea becomes a much more minor event as a result.Biblical inaccuracies aside, Even if you're happy to view the movie as purely a work of fiction and watch it as an original drama, it doesn't work. The plot drifts, doesn't always make sense or tie-up well and the movie could have done with some editing. Performances are so-so. Even Christian Bale seems to be phoning it in. Joel Edgerton is okayish as Ramses. John Turturro seems miscast as Seti. Great names in the supporting cast - Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Ben Mendelsohn, Aaron Paul, Tara Fitzgerald - but their considerable talents are vastly under-utilised.About the only positive thing I can say about this is that at least it is not as bad as Noah...",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Ridley Scott's epic take on the Biblical tale of Moses gets the origin story as an Egyptian general (Bale making the best of it) who discovers he is in fact a Hebrew, the race of slaves, and a 'chosen one' of God to lead his people out from their plight and his stepbrother Ramses (Edgerton, ditto in guy liner). The struggle to remain devoted is palpable thanks largely to the reasonable script cobbled by Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian. Scott wisely keeps the CGI on a broad stroke level and going full tilt in the 'seven plagues upon Egypt' act wisely. While the film tends to meander in spots and kind of ends rather abruptly on the whole it is a decent tale of the prophets come full force.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
17,neil-476,"Typical Ridley: great visuals, sod all else",7,9 January 2015,"Back in ancient Egypt, BatMoses has a friendly quasi-sibling thing going on with baldie Ramses. Baldie Ramses' dad Seti, named after the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, rates BatMoses higher than baldie Ramses but, when Seti dies, baldie Ramses takes over as Pharaoh and turns out to be a bit of a petulant bully. BatMoses turns out to be a Hebrew, and takes it upon himself to get baldie Ramses to release 400,000 Hebrew slaves so that they can wander home to Canaan, to the annoyance of his (BatMoses) Spanish wife. This proposal doesn't go down well with baldie Ramses as he has an extensive redevelopment programme going on in downtown Memphis (Egypt, not Tennessee), which does not include street lighting despite the Egyptian desert being curiously dark. BatMoses gets helpful hints on how to proceed from God, who only he can see (God has decided that he will achieve maximum credibility if he takes the form of a peevish 11 year-old lad with a speech impediment). Baldie Ramses eventually lets the Hebrews go after a bit of murder on God's part, which is only fair given that there was a bit of murder on baldie Ramses' part too, and BatMoses leads the Hebrews on a gentle stroll beside the seaside which turns out to be rather more dramatic than anyone expected. Eventually, after many visits to the Straggly Hebrew Beard And Wig Shoppe, BatMoses leads the Hebrews to a bit of desert which looks the same as every other bit of desert, still with no street lighting.There are no huge surprises here. Neither Moses nor Ramses comes across as at all sympathetic: only Seti (a surprisingly well cast John Turturro) is likable. God is truly annoying. The plagues are done well: in fact, the visuals are well done apart from everything being so dark. Perhaps it was the 3D specs, perhaps the projector needed a new bulb, but even the scenes in full desert sunlight looked dim. Christian Bale's BatMoses has an odd accent, which wavers between English and a variation of his BatRoar. These people are pros, so they aren't bad, but there is nothing here which screams ""Oscar"".Ridley Scott reliably gets great visuals on screen, and disappoints with a lack of substance behind them.

18,Uriah43,Only in Hollywood,4,14 January 2015,"The story of Moses has been told and retold so many times that I doubt I need to go over it again. However, this movie has a totally different take on it so it might be best to warn viewers ahead of time not to expect too much similarity between it and the version as told from the Bible. There is very little comparison. But rather than detail all of the differences I will just give a few of the reasons why I was so disappointed. First, God comes to Moses in the form of a child. That's right-a child. Now you would think with all of the technology available to Hollywood they could have come up with something better than that. But apparently that was the best that they could do. Likewise when the plagues were sent upon Egypt it is widely known that Moses visited the Pharoah prior to each one of them to give Pharoah a chance to let the Hebrew people go. Not in this movie-they just came upon Pharoah and his people with Moses being nowhere near. And on and on it goes. Only in Hollywood. Be that as it may I suppose it wasn't too bad and if a viewer doesn't expect any Biblical accuracy then perhaps they might enjoy it somewhat. But I was disappointed and rate it as slightly below average.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
19,ferguson-6,A Throwback Biblical Epic,6,11 December 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Two huge Old Testament epics in one year is quite unusual in this era of superhero overload. But then, if you squint just right, there is a dash of superhero in both Noah and Moses, and each of their stories plays equally well as an action-packed adventure or bible scripture. If you are the type to analyze all the religious errors, you might first consider that the three male leads are played by an Australian, a Welsh, and a Knighted Sir. So a grain of salt is in order; and you should understand that director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, 2000) is more interested in the cinematic ""wow"" factor than he is in biblical accuracy.Moses (Christian Bale) and Ramses (Joel Edgerton) are raised as brothers in Egypt circa 1300 BCE. Ramses' father is the ruling Pharaoh Seti (John Turturro) who believes Moses to be the better leader of people than his own son. But in those days, blood ruled, and soon after discovering that Moses is actually Hebrew rather than Egyptian, Ramses cast him into the desert.A few years later Moses chats it up with God (actually Metatron archangel that looks like a schoolboy), and the next thing we know, fish are dying in poisoned waters, giant crocodiles are chomping on fisherman, an impressive onslaught of frogs and locusts attack, followed by massive swarms of flies, and finally the darkness of death. Ramses finally ends the streak of plagues by agreeing to free the Hebrew slaves. Moses then leads the masses on the infamous trek  a not so enjoyable trip that peaks with the parting of Red Sea – a very impressive movie effect, even when compared to the wall of water seen recently in Interstellar.The movie is dominated by Bale and Edgerton, with only minor supporting roles from John Turturro, Sigourney Weaver (maybe 3 lines of dialogue), Aaron Paul as Joshua (lots of quiet eye-balling of Moses), Sir Ben Kingsley as Nun, a hilarious Ben Mendelsohn, the always energetic Ewen Bremner, and the very classy Hiam Abbass.Director Ridley Scott has dedicated this one to his brother Tony, and it's sure to be one of those movies that some critics will enjoy bashing, just because they can. And there will be the nostalgic viewers who fondly recall Cecil B DeMille's The Ten Commandments (either version), and the pomposity displayed by Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner. But for those movie goers looking for an adventure movie in the form of a throwback biblical epic with eye-popping special effects, it seems the answer will be a resounding ""yes"" to the question of  ""Are you not entertained?""",Exodus - Gods and Kings
20,anaconda-40658,A Live Prince of Egypt.,8,25 February 2016,"Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Ben Kingsley: Visually stunning Biblical epic about reputation. The title references the idea of one powerful God, or Ramesses oppressing his people to the point where he believes he is a god. The king of the title physically references Ramesses but it really addresses the emerging power of Moses, whom we learn was adopted as Ramesses's brother. Moses will learn that he was saved from being killed as a baby when rescued into the palace by his supposed mother. Tired of the brutality Ramesses demonstrates upon slaves, Moses retaliates when he learns of his true origins, and this has him abandoned in the desert. Christians will likely take issue with some of the Biblical flaws including God being represented by a kid when in the Bible he was represented by a cloud. Thankfully it avoids being the disgrace Noah is by relating the highlights including the plagues distributed upon the Egyptians including frogs, locusts, and the deaths of first born males. The parting of the red sea is another impressive visual highlight. Directed by Ridley Scott whose best films include Blade Runner and Alien. Christian Bale plays off the oppressed yet determination of Moses whose communication with God grows frustrating. Joel Edgerton plays the stubborn tyrant Ramesses who falls hard. John Turturro and Ben Kingsley turn up in appealing roles but many of the actors are subdued in limited or laughable roles.

21,phd_travel,A spectacular epic that entertains despite some casting flaws,8,11 December 2014,"This grand biblical epic delivers. Overall the good points outweigh the flaws especially in the latter 2 thirds.Firstly the good points: 1. Visuals are spectacular. The Egyptian sets and animals look realistic. It gives it an authentic feel pre excessive CGI look. The only problem is the filming was in Spain and Canary Islands and doesn't look desert like enough for Egypt. It feels too Northern. 2. The plagues upon the people are done in a satisfyingly logical way. Good job here. 3. The parting of the Red Sea is updated to give it as plausible a rendition as possible. No neat dry ocean floor to walk across like in ""The 10 Commandments"". 4. The pace is quite good. Even though it's over 2 hours it doesn't drag except a bit in the earlier third. The flaws 1. Casting: Joel Edgerton ruined ""the Great Gatsby"" and he is just as much of a joke here. He looked and played it like a plump petulant overgrown schoolboy with eye liner constantly munching on snacks. Not dignified enough for Ramses. This role should have gone to someone who looked more Mediterranean at least. Much has been said about the casting of ethnically inappropriate people in the lead roles and this criticism is entirely deserved for Joel - old Hollywood did it better with Yul Brynner in ""10 Commandments"". At least the 2 wives looked right. Christian Bale is better though he could have been made to look more Middle Eastern with makeup. Liked Aaron Paul as Joshua. Look out for him behind the beard and straggly long hair. Wish he had more dialog. 2. The clipped British accents of some of the characters was out of place. Should have tried for a neutral to vaguely Middle Eastern accent. 3. The little boy to represent God's voice. Very wrong. 4. Some badly written dialog that seems out of place for the time.Overall go and see it on the biggest screen you can find. It's worth it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The details of loyalty towards old ties and Moses' destiny were unravelled in Exodus story. Details of Egyptian life, and interpretation of miracles and events were portrayed in a manner where belief and doubt were sub stories in Exodus. How one sees God is challenged in the movie. Scott executed a film which creates a feel for the people, politics and the living conditions for the times. Bale, Edgerton, etc portrayed strong characters.

25,JamesHitchcock,A little boy running round playing at being God,7,4 February 2015,"The success of Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" in 2000 seemed to presage a revival of the epic, and it was soon followed by ""Troy"" and Oliver Stone's ""Alexander"". The comparative failure of this last brought the revival to a temporary end, but 2014 was the year that saw the revival of the revival with ""Pompeii"" and two films on Old Testament themes, ""Noah"" and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"", again directed by Scott. (I understand there has also been a film on the legend of Hercules, which I have not seen). This film tells the story of Moses and the exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt. This is, of course, a story which has been told before, most famously by Cecil B DeMille in ""The Ten Commandments"" from 1956. Like that film it follows the account given in the Book of Exodus, although not always faithfully, and as with that film the mainspring of the action is the rivalry between Moses and the Egyptian Prince, later Pharaoh, Ramesses, although here their rivalry is purely political. (In the earlier film both men were also in love with the same woman). Moses is initially shown as a successful general and a member of the royal family; it is only later, when he discovers his Hebrew origins, that he is inspired to liberate his people from bondage. In a departure from the biblical account he here becomes a sort of Che Guevara of 1300 BC, leading a group of escaped slaves in a guerrilla war against the Egyptians, before God decides that he is making slow progress and that a series of plagues will achieve far more than the military efforts of the Hebrew Liberation Front ever could. The Ten Plagues of Egypt are depicted much more fully than they were DeMille's film, although even here Scott sometimes departs from the biblical story. (I don't remember a plague of crocodiles in my Bible). Scott does not, however, dwell upon the Hebrews' wanderings in the wilderness to the same extent as DeMille. Possibly Scott's oddest move was his decision to depict God as a young boy; perhaps DeMille's solution of a disembodied bass voice booming at Moses from out of a burning bush struck him as too much of a cliché, and the alternative of omitting God altogether would not have gone down well with the conservative Christians who, in America at least, would make up a significant proportion of the audience. (At times Scott does seem to be flirting with a secular interpretation of Exodus; possible natural explanations are canvassed for the various plagues, and the burning bush episode could be a hallucination suffered by Moses, who has recently been injured in a landslide). The film's star, Christian Bale, is on record as describing Moses as ""likely schizophrenic"" and ""one of the most barbaric individuals I ever read about in my life"". It is therefore perhaps unsurprising that, his interpretation is very different from that of Charlton Heston in the 1956 film. Heston played the role with the respectful dignity he felt appropriate to an Old Testament prophet and patriarch; Bale's Moses is much more troubled and conflicted. This is perhaps a more appropriate interpretation for 2014 when even many devout Christians have difficulty in reconciling the bloodlust of some of the Old Testament stories with the New Testament's message of reconciliation and forgiveness. It takes a peculiarly dedicated fundamentalist to accept something like the Slaughter of the Firstborn as the handiwork of a just God. The Ten Plagues of Egypt are well realised (especially the frogs), although I was disappointed by the crossing of the Red Sea, in which the Hebrews simply seem to wade across at low tide rather than walking between two walls of water as in traditional depictions of this event (and in DeMille's film). Scott may have wanted to imply that a tsunami rather than a miracle was behind the parting of the sea, or perhaps that the destruction of Ramesses' army was due less to his defiance of Jehovah than to his failure to consult the tide tables. Sir Ridley is a practised hand at telling an epic tale; besides ""Gladiator"" he also has the mediaeval adventure ""Kingdom of God"" on his curriculum vitae. Yet I did not feel that this retelling of a familiar story added much to ""The Ten Commandments"". Certainly, to some modern viewers DeMille's film can seem excessively reverential in its approach to the Bible, yet it is nevertheless a monument of the cinema, combining exciting adventure with a sense of spectacle and grandeur. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" occasionally achieves similar levels of spectacle, as in the battle with the Hittites, but it lacks the grandeur which lifts ""The Ten Commandments"" out of the ordinary. Scott never quite has the courage to treat a Bible story in purely secular terms, but he also never quite succeeds in combining the earthly and the supernatural elements of his story into an integrated whole in the way which DeMille could. The result is a gritty adventure story with a period setting, and a little boy running round playing at being God. 7/10 A goof. We see the Hebrew slaves building pyramids, although the Egyptian pyramids were built long before the time of Moses.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
26,KineticSeoul,It just doesn't have an impact,6,23 May 2015,"Watching this movie was sort of like watching ""Avatar"" where instead of making a uplifting and powerful movie. With intricate and compelling story where it could have been directed to have heart and depth. Just becomes a bland retelling that focuses more on the visuals. Sure, visuals can be great if the story and direction is able to back it up. Instead it just goes by the numbers, instead of it giving impact to audiences, Christians or not. So this is a retelling that goes in a more ambiguous direction. Where the whole thing could have been miraculous and supernatural or it could just be based on practicality. I could tell the director Ridley Scott thought to go in a unbiased direction, but it falters. It's a movie that can anger the Christian audiences for it being a retelling of the Moses story in the Bible. And it can anger the atheists for obvious reasons or they might be okay with it since it's a ambiguous movie. Also yeah, white actors playing Eyptians and such started out bothersome but after awhile I got used to it...Or I just didn't care anymore. After the first 1 hour and 30 minutes, I just wanted this movie to end, which I had to wait 1 more hour for. Despite the grandscale set pieces and special effects. There just didn't seem to be much reason for me to invest in this movie. It didn't entice or grab my attention. It just lacked the weight and impact necessary to leave at least a bit of a positive impression. Overall, all I can say is that it's a watchable film, nothing more.

27,sddavis63,Well Acted But Poorly Paced,6,23 August 2018,"What could you compare this movie to except Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 epic ""The Ten Commandments."" They're very different movies telling the same story - that of the exodus of the Hebrew slaves from Egypt described in the Book of Exodus in the Bible and fleshed out for the big screen on several occasions, most notably the aforementioned 1956 version. This story is quite different. It places a lot more emphasis on Moses' early years. Here, Moses is a military leader of Egypt who grew up in the same home as Ramses, Pharaoh's son; in fact, the two of them were brothers, sworn to defend each other. The movie opens with a battle between the Egyptians and the Hittities. Ramses commands the Egyptian forces, but his life is saved in the battle by Moses and Moses is hailed as a hero - the start of the jealousy between the two that serves as the engine for everything else that happens basically.Once you get through the filler about Moses' early life (because it's all extremely speculative - not even the biblical account says much about Moses' early life - the rest of the story seems a bit like extended vignettes. Moses is exiled, Moses is called by God, Moses returns to Egypt, God brings plagues on the Egyptians, the Hebrews are freed, the Egyptians pursue them, etc., etc. Of the latter material I thought some of it was well done. The plagues in particular impressed me. They were largely seen as natural occurrences, but the hand of God is seen to be involved. The crossing of the Red Sea was done very differently than DeMille's version, but was still effective. On the other hand, Moses' call from God seemed underplayed and not as dramatic as it should have been - and perhaps even delusional, caused by Moses being hit on the head by a rock after a rockslide! Atheists no doubt will appreciate that (as, I'm sure, did Christian Bale, who played Moses and expressed some very negative beliefs about Moses) but I thought it weakened the drama of the story. But I did like the fact that God was portrayed in this movie as a young boy. That put me in mind of Isaiah 11:6 - ""and a little child shall lead them.""The performances generally were decent enough. I actually liked Bale as Moses. His constant battle with God over his call, his general reluctance to be the leader of God's people. Bale portrayed all that very well. Compared to the 1956 movie, Ridley Scott (even in spite of CGI) put together less of a ""spectacle"" I thought. This movie was ""earthier"" if I could put it that way. But as I suggested above, the pacing was off, and considering how little happened after the crossing of the Red Sea, the movie could have easily been cut by about 20 minutes and the movie could have ended with the destruction of the Egyptian Army rather than the cursory nod toward the commandments and Moses' later life. This isn't a bad movie, but it's also not a great one.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
28,Hellmant,This story deserves to be told in an epic way and I really think Scott accomplished that!,9,16 December 2014,"'EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Bible epic retelling of the classic story of Moses and his mission to free 600,000 Hebrew slaves, in ancient Egypt. It stars Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses. It also features John Turturro, Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver, Ben Mendelsohn and Aaron Paul in supporting roles. Ridely Scott directed the movie (he also dedicated it to his brother Tony, who died in 2012) and the screenplay was written by Adam Cooper, Jeffrey Caine, Bill Collage and Steven Zaillian (who's written other epic drama films, like 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' and 'AMERICAN GANGSTER'). I really enjoyed watching it's grand action scenes, and spectacular visuals (on the big screen), and I also found it's updated interpretation, of the classic mythical story, to be really interesting and fascinating to watch as well. The story begins in 1300 BC Egypt, with Moses (Bale) serving as a general in the royal Egyptian army. He fights alongside Prince Ramses (Edgerton), in a battle with the Hittite army, and saves his life, just as a recent prophecy foretold. Moses learns, while visiting the city of Pithom, that he was born to Hebrew parents, before being sent to be raised by the Pharaoh's daughter. This angers Moses, who does not believe the story is true, but when Ramses hears the tale he has Moses exiled. Moses then travels to Midian, where he meets his wife and has a son. He lives there, in peace and happiness, for nine years; until God calls on him to be a general once again, and free his people.I really found the movie to be extremely entertaining and emotionally moving. Bale gives another amazing and passionate performance and Scott's directing style is breathtaking. The story deserves to be told in an epic way and I really think Scott accomplished that here. It's a very interesting take on the details of how everything happened; presenting things in an almost realistic, science-based, way. It's also very dark and gritty but not nearly as weird as the other blockbuster bible film, 'NOAH', from earlier this year (which I also really liked).

30,Robert_duder,Entertaining and fun to watch...not much more but does it deserve hatred?,8,23 December 2014,"After really truly enjoying Aronofsky's Noah I was anticipating Exodus to a high degree. I suppose my expectations were pretty high but if any story could warrant a big budget special effects spectacle, it would be Moses. 1956's The Ten Commandments was and still is mind blowing in that department. It is epic on every scale. Nowadays capturing an ""epic"" feel a little harder since so many films have enormous bloated budgets. I was not let down by Exodus: Gods and Kings at all. I had a great time, really enjoyed the film and despite a few sub par performances and moments, the film holds its own. I was genuinely surprised by the really harsh reviews I have read on the movie and I realized the biggest difference between why many reviewers (amateur and professional) hated it and why I enjoyed it is because I managed to not take it quite so seriously. I'm not enraged that the cast were white Egyptians (Charlton Heston was the whitest guy in Hollywood but no one seemed to care when he played Moses) and I don't mind the liberties taken with the story...they are retelling a familiar bible story so adding some creative liberties is okay by me (Noah certainly did it in spades) and I was watching the film to be entertained.I feel like I say this a lot when I see a Christian Bale movie but I feel like he was definitely not the best casting choice for Moses. In the beginning of the film he felt completely out of place and really seemed sort of clumsy in the role and then later on he sort of fell into place and actually turned out being decent. He has a good chemistry and they needed a star and he fit the bill. One of the biggest issues with Exodus is the poor casting. Bale was okay at best, John Turturro was a ridiculous choice for the Pharaoh, he actually seemed like he belonged in a comedy and then they completely misused and underused Ben Kingsley, Aaron Paul and Sigourney Weaver in three downright terrible performances that could have been good if the script had allowed them more. Weaver is barely existent in the film and Paul is very poorly miscast and underused. I thought, however, there was one exceptional performance in the film. I actually would go so far as to say he is the sole reason to see the film. Joel Edgerton as Ramses was electrifying. He seemed invested, the character was great, the relationship between he and Bale's Moses was the backbone of the film and he played the part with a lot of emotion and power. You believed his character and he did a terrific job. Its not an Oscar worthy performance or anything because the film isn't of that calibre but its a great performance in a good movie.I think a lot of fans had high hopes for a ""sword and sandal"" flick from Ridley Scott. Gladiator is sort of considered the pinnacle modern day historical epic and for good reason. This is far more of a mainstream entry for Scott. The 3D of course is completely unnecessary but some of the more epic scenes are well handled. Of course the bar for which this film would be measured against would be the parting of the red sea. Everyone sits and waits for that scene...I certainly did. At first it seemed almost anti-climatic. The sea drains rather than parts and they make their way merrily across it. If Scott had missed that opportunity I would have dubbed this a dud but he turns it around and gives you this mind blowing, beautiful, breathtaking and claustrophobic scene of the sea coming back to place and wiping out the Egyptians. If everything else about the film is average...that scene had me pinned to my seat and made me say ""wow."" The special effects in the film overall are excellent. Nothing looked hokey and the massive scale Egyptian scenes are very well done considering they are likely entirely CGI. The plagues unleashed are all done well and the film is simply great to watch. I often disagree with other viewers and reviewers and this is one of them. I thought the film was quite good and had a great time watching it. It might not be a classic but it holds its own amidst the sea of blockbusters this year. 8/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings
31,MOscarbradley,Not the turkey it might have been.,7,29 December 2014,"Earlier this year Darren Aronofsky gave us his radical rethink of the story of Noah. That film was no masterpiece but at least it was different and glum enough to alienate its audience. Now it's Ridley Scott's turn. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is about how Moses lead 'the chosen people' out of bondage in Egypt. We all know the story, if not from the Bible then from Cecil B De Mille's 1956 epic ""The Ten Commandments"". That lasted about 40 years, (well, about 4 hours that often felt like 40 years). This clocks in at a reasonably economical 2 hours 30 minutes and dispenses with all of the early stuff of Moses being found in the bull-rushes etc. while all that business about the ten commandments are thrown out in the last five minutes. What's left is a good, old-fashioned and really rather blood-thirsty biblical epic that, were it not for the excellent CGI, could have come straight from from the sixties.It's far from perfect; the script is fairly banal and apart from Christian Bale, (excellent as Moses, or as good as he can be under the circumstances), a large 'name' cast is totally wasted, (as Ramses, Joel Edgerton exudes absolutely no charisma at all; give me Yul Brynner any day), otherwise Scott keeps things rattling along nicely. The plagues are superbly handled and the 'parting' of the Red Sea is certainly spectacular. It also plays fast and loose with 'the facts', (Egypt has already banned the film for being historically inaccurate), but since 'the facts' are largely a matter of interpretation, I have no problem with that. It's also great to look at, thanks to Dariusz Wolski's superb cinematography. No masterpiece then, but not the turkey it might have been either.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
32,richardchatten,Diverting Enough...,6,4 November 2019,"I ironically first became aware of this film when it became the centre of a firestorm of criticism about five years ago over the 'whitewashing' of history by casting hot caucasian Sigourney Weaver as an ancient Egyptian queen. (This may have been a canny publicity ploy to get us to all watch it, since she's hardly in it, but thanks to all the 'negative' publicity surrounding her role in it we certainly do now; which is why I bothered to watch it in the first place!)Ironically it's her accent that was actually the most incongruous aspect of her presence in it; and the wide range of accents throughout the cast that most recalled the old Hollywood biblical epics of the fifties.'Gods and Kings' does have the odd sliver of wit that makes it worth trudging through, and both the cast and the design often look good; although the cartoonish CGI aerial shots will probably date it even faster than it's fifties forbears.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
33,ThomasDrufke,They're My People,7,12 December 2014,"No Moses is not white. No Ramses is not white. No Moses never actually says ""let my people go"", and no Moses never actually parts the sea. But I am going to take this film for what it is and try to forget about the fact that nearly the entire cast is whitewashed. It's sad that we can get real Egyptians to play these roles, but that's the society we live in. I don't blame anyone for not seeing this movie because of those issues or hating it because of it, but I tried to forget about that when I saw the film.And I have to say, I enjoyed the film. It has it's issues but it was better than I expected. Christian Bale is probably the sole reason I was still interested in seeing it after the casting, and he gives another terrific performance. Now this Moses is a very different Moses than people remember. He is a brooding mad military leader who never says the iconic lines or anything, but a great leader nonetheless. Joel Edgerton was fine but even though his makeup was actually rather perfect, I still managed to stop myself a few times in the movie to remember it's really a white guy.No spoilers here, but I thought the way they portrayed god was different and original and I didn't mind it. I can totally see the other side of it but I thought the film actually had almost all of the elements you would want from a Moses epic. The film looks absolutely gorgeous by the way. I don't know that I have ever seen a more real looking Egypt or anywhere out in the middle east for that matter. Ridley Scott still knows how to direct a beautifully looking film that's for sure. Even if you don't agree with his casting decisions I think we can all agree on that. So I do understand everyone's problems with the film, and I wont argue against them, I just think if you look at it for what it was, it's a solid film.+Looks gorgeous +Bales performance +Differences to the story worked for me -Perhaps a bit too long -Whitewashed 7.7/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings
34,MLDinTN,special effects good...,6,25 September 2015,"story was so-so. I thought this movie was OK but could have been better with more character development and keeping it at about 2 hours long. The story is about the biblical character, Moses. At first he is living in the Egyptian palace, thought of as a brother to Ramses. Then the true story of him being a Hebrew comes to light and he is exiled. Years pass and he begins hearing from God and how he must lead the Hebrew people. So all these things happen to the Egyptians like a red river killing the fish, frogs, flies, the plague. What I didn't like was the killer crocodiles(I don't think that happens in the bible.) Moses gives Ramses a last warning to free the Hebrew slaves and Ramses later regrets his decision. So we all know the slaves are freed and the Red Sea parts as they make there way to Caanon. In the movie the water gets lower then all together disappears and then this huge wave comes and washes over Moses and Ramses but neither die. I don't think that was in the bible and it shouldn't been in the movie.FINAL VERDICT: The battles were good and I liked the scenery. I thought it was OK and worth watching if nothing else is on.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
35,lesleyharris30,"Proves that Biblical Epics are Hard to make,",5,10 October 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is a very mediocre movie with a rather weakly developed storyline and an impressive cast. It's not all bad, Christian Bale certainly shines as Moses, he is both physically and vocally right for this role, it is clear that he put a lot of work in to his performance, the effects are also impressive, particularly the scene in the sea towards the end is visually stunning. Sadly, the performances and effects can't make up for the poorly written storyline, the film goes nowhere for a long time, and the exciting scenes are brief, there is too much scenes where the characters are just talking, saying boring lines of dialogue that leaves its audience bored. The characters are also a very weak aspect of this film, though the actors do their best, their is nothing compelling about any of them, there's no actual human character, it felt like the director was simply too afraid to offend it's source material, which leaves every character not being any bit real and giving us nothing to relate to, the whole movie feels like it was taken right out of the bible and never tries to be its own thing. Though it has its moments, Exodus: Gods and Kings is an overlong, detailed and unfulfilling adventure that I couldn't possibly recommend.

I also have seen Noah with Russel Crowe and thought that was awful. I was hoping this would be better than that one. I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. The movie moves along faster and is much more exciting than the Ten Commandments. Bale and Edgerton are great in this movie. Even if you aren't totally religious this is a movie you will enjoy.

But on the orders of God Moses returns to free the slaves, and escort them to the promise land.The newly crowned Pharaoh, however, isn't about to let that happen.Hard to take serious but harder to hate, director Ridley Scott manifests a stark and bleak depiction of the Exodus.As ostentatious as other adaptations but with modern pacing, enhanced special effects and refined acting, Gods and Kings is a well-intentioned successor.Incidentally, after the Israelites left, the incomplete pyramids were contracted out to aliens.

40,ironhorse_iv,"A lot of people might exodus out of the theater for this, but for me. It wasn't that bad.",6,20 December 2014,"Ridley Scott goes biblical! I think certain people in Hollywood are living in the old school approach to making epics. They were born or live through the years that biblical sword and sandals films were hits like 1956's The Ten Commandments, 1959's Ben Hur, and 1961's King of Kings. Clearly, they want to remake those epics to fit the modern age. Clearly, it's not those types of epics that the main audience wants to see, anymore these days. I think a lot of people have a love/hate relationship with religion. Some people clearly see films like these as force propaganda tools to keep people still interested in theology in a world that clearly exploring more means. Others see it, as a joke, because a lot of modern day Christian films are pretty preachy, the acting is terrible and stilted, the cameras predictable and boorish, and the post-production sound and music integration cliché and clumsy. In all, there is a small group of people that would see a film like this; the deeply religious, who mostly will pick apart it for its inaccurates and those who want to see something new, out of these, but can't find themselves too engage in the story. 2014 was a big year of bible type films, and sadly, most of them got bad reviews. In my opinion, this movie is a lot better than 2014's Noah or 2014's Left Behind, big time. Directed by Ripley Scott, the movie retells the story of the Old Testament story of the Exodus, by adding state of the art visuals and 3D immersion. By doing that, he hopes to bring new life to the story of the defiant leader Moses (Christian Bale) as he rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Rameses (Joel Edgerton), on a quest to let his people go. In my opinion, this film is not in the level of 1999's animation film, Prince of Egypt in story-telling. Prince of Egypt seem more faithful to the source material. You really get into the drama of that film. You really felt the struggles of the Hebrew slaves in that film and felt happy when they came to their freedom. You don't really see much of the mistreatment of the Hebrew in this film. In Prince of Egypt, you really felt the breakdown of the brotherhood between Moses and Rameses in that movie, and felt the depth of it, both find themselves in other side. In this film, the film doesn't really focus on their relationship, at all. You barely sense that they are even family. In Prince of Egypt, you felt the possibility of redemption, as Moses come from narcissistic clueless boy to a peaceful loving leader. In this film, Moses is a crazy murderer; whom by the end of the film is still, a crazy murderer type leader. In Prince of Egypt, you felt the faith that the Hebrew people had, and understood, why they would believe in God. In this film, the movie doesn't show any faith in its subject matter, making it seem like believing in God is something, a crazy person might do. This movie lacks heart. Yes, it's more accuracy to maybe what really happen, but its lacks the story-telling to make it, very entertaining. It's the same way, that the previous, Ridley Scott's film 2010's Robin Hood fails to do. It forgets to make it a good time fairy tale movie, rather than a real life harsh drama that most people don't want to see. Still, there were a few 'inaccurates', this film had, that might need another closer look. One is the Biblical plagues. Most of them have been removed or replace in this film version. Some of them, are really out of place, like the killer alligators sequence. I like how the movie really try to find natural causes for the plagues, but comes off, as off putting. You don't put logic in a very illogic story like the bible. It's like exposing, the magic trick to people. People don't want to see that. Honestly, if they, really wanted to seem more accuracy. I wonder why didn't, they have the crossing of the sea of reeds, rather than the red sea? Nor why, didn't the film was set during the 1550 BCE, during the reign of Ahmose. The date of 1270 BC where Ramesses II was the Pharaoh is not accepted by most Bible scholars. It would make more sense, if they put it during Ahmose's reign. Another big complain about the film is the casting of white actors in ethic lead roles. I find this complain, a bit overdramatic. Personal, I don't find anything wrong with the actors, they choice to lead the film, since the film does put good main stream actors in those roles. Would, I like to have ethic actors, play the role? Sure, but I'm pretty OK with Joel Edgerton and Christian Bale in these roles. I do give the movie, some credit for having multiple Middle Eastern and North Africans in support roles. Some people called for a boycott of the film, due to the race matter, and I find them to be taking it too serious. Overall: Exodus is the theological foundation of the Bible. Sadly, this movie didn't tell that story that well. However, it's not the worst, retelling of a biblical story, but if you want a good version of the story. Watch 1999's Prince of Egypt. It's a film that really is underrated and deserve more credit. If you choice to watch this, I can still recommended it. It's not that bad.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
41,The-Sarkologist,Ignoring all the other problems - this film was just plain boring,3,21 December 2014,"I'm not necessarily going to say that Ridley Scott is a bad director because we know that he is not – all we need to do at some of his previous classics (such as Aliens) to realise this. However his latest offering has so many things wrong with it that I am wondering why it is that he was picked to direct this movie. Granted the story of Moses and Pharoah has been a story that has captured our imaginations for thousands of years, which is not surprising since this story forms the foundation of the Jewish faith, from which Christianity sprang, however I felt that this particular version was butchered in ways that it simply did not need to be butchered. I remember discussing the Hollywood version of the Exodus story with some friends a few years ago and the issue of Pharaoh and Moses being brothers would come up a number of times. The general consensus was that this was not the case, however a later reading of the original text actually suggests that this interpretation may be the correct one. How else would Moses have been able to make demands of Pharaoh, numerous times, if that connection did not exist? If Moses was anybody else would Pharaoh have ordered him executed for making such demands of him? Most likely. No, I actually suspect that the idea of them being brothers is the more correct one. Okay, this movie also seems to take a more rational approach to the plagues that struck Egypt during that time, and while I know that there are Christians out there that would be offended at having a scientific approach to the cause behind the plagues, I don't think that that is necessarily a problem. At least in this film, they used hail stones as opposed to fiery comets coming from the heavens (aka Prince of Egypt). Okay, ignoring the fact that I did find this film really, really boring, I guess there were other issues that put me off of it. I have read some commentaries and reactions against the film, and I can understand the reaction against the portrayal of Negroes as slaves in the film (despite the fact that that is probably more accurate than quite a few other aspects in the film – the Nubians to the south of Egypt were Negroid and also an enemy of Egypt, so no doubt they would have found themselves as part of the Egyptians' slave force). I guess the thing that really got me was portraying Moses and his ilk as a revolutionary force. The movie sets Moses up as a General, and at the burning bush scene God advises him that he is looking for a military leader. I'm not convinced that working with this aspect of the story really does it justice. The original text does not indicate that Moses was running around launching guerrilla raids against the Egyptians, and there is no indication that God commanded him to do so. Rather, he was to confront Pharaoh and demand that he let the Hebrews go. Then there is Aaron, who seems to spend all of his time in the background, where as in the original text he is front and centre, with the suggestion that he would speak on behalf of Moses because Moses was not a very good orator. Granted, the film is visually spectacular, but it was still really dull. I guess I can put up with some creative license, and there are aspects in the film that are quite believable (such as Pharaoh's statement that to let the slaves go free would be economic suicide). I'm still not convinced that the hangman's noose was a form of public execution in those days, and we all know that the Israelites did not build the pyramids (in my reckoning the Israelites were in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom, while the pyramids were built during the Old Kingdom). I'm not really sure about the archers either, though Wikipedia does indicate that the Egyptians did use bows and arrows.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
42,Reno-Rangan,A better movie for vfx geek like me!,8,3 April 2015,"This is a well known story and I have also seen the '56 movie 'The Ten Commandments'. So in this film could not foresee the modification, but it did in a slight manner like the later 'Noah' movie. The best part was the visuals, the graphics were so good, hard to resist the pleasure if you are vfx geek like me. That's the reason I love modern movie, especially remake of a classic like 'King Kong'. The problem in this flick was lie in the story telling.As we know, Ridley Scott is an excellent narrator, but this movie was too short even though it ran 150 minutes. I felt it was just a brief, I mean there were no details or depth in the important scenes. You will know what I'm saying if you had watched '56 movie I mentioned in a above paragraph. That's drawback for the first timers at a same time advantage for not to fall in boredom for those who have already seen other versions. Christian Bale, awesome; Joel Edgerton, good; Ben Kingsley, never required; Aaron Paul, totally waste.Overall, not cleverly stablised in the scenes that are very important, especially the final one about ten commandments should have been extended a little bit with a moral message. If it was a Peter Jackson movie, definitely it would have been a trilogy with an aggregated time of over 500 minutes. This movie was an entertainer like I enjoyed it than the message deliverer. Must be watched for the amusement and for the pleasure in updating technical aspect of the narration rather than inspiration.7.5/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings
43,tomgillespie2002,Left me longing for the simplicity of DeMille's vision,4,3 May 2015,"There is a moment during the climax of Ridley Scott's latest epic where your mind will drift to the image of a bearded Charlton Heston waving his giant staff and parting the Red Sea in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments (1956). Exodus: Gods and Kings tells the story of Moses and Ramses, the familiar Old Testament tale about two former brothers-in-arms fighting on opposite sides of the battle; the former for the Hebrews, long enslaved by the ruling Egyptians, and the latter recently becoming the new Pharaoh in the wake of his father's death. It's the type of story that - even if the build-up lacks dramatics - is destined to be spectacular at the climax, as if there's on thing we do well in the modern age, it's spectacle.Yet Exodus is an alarmingly bland and stuttering attempt to paint a revisionist's view of an age-old tale, resulting in a mixture of Ben-Hur (1959) and Gladiator (2000) without the scope or entertainment factor. Even Christian Bale, an actor usually of such ferocious intensity, fails to squeeze any dimensions out of Moses, and invites little sympathy during his darkest hours. Scott teases us with his own atheistic views, portraying Moses as a troubled man with possible schizophrenia, an idea which, if fully developed, would have justified this film's existence as a revisionist piece. His personality disorder manifests itself as a mediocre British child actor playing an angry God while Moses skulks on a mountain top, but outside of these moments he is little more than the archetypal command-blaring, sword-waving hero who delivers speeches and observes his men during training montages.The only one appearing to be having any fun at all is Joel Edgerton, the Aussie actor playing the shaven-headed, bronzed-up Egyptian Pharaoh. Though he is kept at a disappointing distance, he at least manages to bring a little swagger to his performance, regardless of how utterly ridiculous he looks. The bulk of the rest of the cast are also played by Anglo's, all either frustratingly underused or comically miscast (or both). The likes of Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro, Ben Mendelsohn, and every director's favourite go-to ethnic actor Ben Kingsley come and go, making little impact and offering no explanation as to why such familiar faces are required to fill such a role. Aaron Paul no doubt gets the worst deal. His Joshua gets the most screen time outside of Moses and Ramses but does little more than watch in confusion or awe at his leader, depending on how the script wants you to feel at that moment.As a cinematic spectacle, Scott does manage to occasionally enthral. The early battle scene, which has Moses and Ramses charging as comrades, plays like a check-list of war clichés, and you would find better sword-clanking on TV with Game of Thrones. The ten plagues set-piece is extremely CGI-heavy, but the sweeping shots of the city running red with blood and infested with locusts and disease proves to be a beautiful sight, with Scott determined to offer a rational explanation to the events rather than it being the work of a vengeful God (though the jury is still out with the first-born deaths). This idea wouldn't be such a hindrance if Scott didn't make the rest of the film such a formulaic blockbuster and took the time to go deep into the psyche of Moses and his struggles with his belief in a God he sees as barbaric. But Exodus is neither revisionist piece nor a straight-forward Biblical epic, which is why I found myself longing for the simplicity of DeMille's vision, for at least you know where you stand.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
44,Dr_Coulardeau,We may be able to learn how to avoid THE catastrophe,10,10 January 2015,"First of all, for a remake, it is rather well done because the director decided to get rid of the most obvious unrealistic elements. To be short on the subject he got rid of all the static scenes like the waiting of the Jews to start for their migration outside the city, the never ending wait for Moses to come back down with the tables, the golden calf and the breaking of the tables, etc. Then he tried to make things slightly more realistic, including with an Egyptian doctor explaining us how the various plagues are nothing but a processing phenomenon: a rebellion of crocodile make the river bloody and kills the fish that rot away bringing crop failure, worms and flies and then some kind of skin infections. But he finally had to come to less natural things: the locusts, well maybe, but then the hail in the storm became frankly iffy, and the final touch of the death of the first born was desperately mysterious and then we reached at this moment the problem of faith.The escape sounds more logical in a way but the crossing of the sea was of course not explainable. We knew there was a ford but Moses goofed and took the road he did not know so that he did not come to the ford. Then we had to believe the water went down all by itself and then the tsunami was natural. Once again we came across the necessity to believe. The alternative is of course to take this film as an action film. I must say Scott did a pretty job thanks to some very hard scenes like the hanging of hostages every day. But then one question comes up. The Hebrews or Jews had been slaves in Egypt for four hundred years. That brings us back around 2000 years BEFORE our era. So how did these Jews become slaves in Egypt since Judaism did not exist yet since Moses had not intervened with their fate yet? Were they Jews before Judaism or did they invent Judaism in slavery? Where did they come from anyway? But most of all this film is speaking to us directly in the situation we have been living in for some 15 years now, at least. This world, I mean the western world as confronted to the rest of the world and particularly the Muslim world, has been managing the three main religions of our times, the three religions that were born in the Middle East from Semitic traditions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, by imposing secularism to them all, the French going a lot farther than the English or the Germans. As long as we do not recognize the people around us as equal in the totality of their existential personalities, including their religions we are pushing them into some kind of mobilization against this secularism and hence against the norms of the west.In France we became hysterical about ""marriage for all"" which excludes by the way any other solution than marriage: ""everyone has to get married"" is implied, and that formula was there to cover same sex marriage or gay marriage. Not to use the word gay or homosexual they got into that phrase and that provoked the Christians mostly into demonstrating for ""A family for everyone."" In the same way anti-Semitism and the obligation for Jews not to show their religion in public places like schools, hospitals or social services, some are moving towards emigrating and becoming extreme Zionists. In the same way finally the Muslims being ordered to hide their religious heritage away from all public places including streets and train stations they are pushed into becoming fundamentalists. If you negate the essence of a person, that person is going to move towards those who are acknowledging that essence, recognizing it and even valorizing it.That is shown so well in the film. The Jews are refused basic recognition and humanity as Jews since they are not Egyptians and they are slaves (where did they come from?), then they will support any extreme action, be it from some men or from God. You may say ""shibboleth since God does not exist,"" like the French extreme secular supporters pretend. Then we saw this week the result in Paris (remember 01/07-08- 09/14, and there is no reason for not more to come. Fundamentalist secularists are just as dangerous as the fundamentalists of any religion because that extreme secularism is a fundamentalist religion, end the worst of them all since it has no God. In France they have ""republican values."" What's that frankly apart from ""secularism"" + ""sexual multi-orientation for everyone""?That film is a masterpiece.

45,zkonedog,You Can't Take God Out Of A Religious Story (And Expect People To Like It),1,26 February 2017,"I know that stories can have different interpretations. I also know that those interpretations need to be fitted to a screenplay in order to be put up on the big screen. Another thing I know, though, is that you can't take the very soul out of any story (religious or not) and expect it to be any good. That is exactly the problem with ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"".For a basic plot summary, ""Exodus"" tells the story of Moses (Christian Bale), who grows up in the court of an Egyptian Pharoah and befriends Ramses (Joel Edgerton), the future heir to the throne. As the men grow older, however, they begin to have their differences, compounded when Moses discovers his true heritage is not at all what he thought, causing him to be exiled into the very people (the Jews) he once semi-ruled over.The problem with this film is so glaring that there is not talking about anything else until it is exposed: You can't take God of a religious script and expect to make it work. If you are going to adapt the Moses story (whether you believe the events occurred or are a myth), you can't rip its heart out along the way. Moses lead the Israelites out from Egyptian rule due to a series of events culminating in a vision from God (a burning bush) that pushed him over the edge. He didn't have a ""love/hate"" relationship with God, nor was God a ""petulant child"" (like He is portrayed in this film). Moses had his doubts, to be sure, but the overall message is basically that he accepted his role as God's mouthpiece, in a sense, for leading the Israelites back to their homeland.Essentially, Ridley Scott is pulling the same crap here that Darren Aronofsky tried to get away with in ""Noah"". I know that religion can be a touchy issue with many people, but these are movies we are talking about here! The ""Harry Potter"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" stories can be touchy with some people too, yet they aren't pillaged of their material before hitting the big screen. Basically, no studio/director besides Mel Gibson (""The Passion of the Christ"") has the guts to make a religious film the way it needs to be made. By making a film like this that treats God in such a sour light, you are effectively doing two things: 1. Alienating Christians (those who know the story to begin with); and 2. Watering down the story for the rest of us. I don't see how either of those things can help the movie succeed.There really is only one positive thing I can say about ""Exodus"": I like the notion that the plagues upon Egypt had a basis in real-life scenarios (e.g. crocodile feeding frenzy turning the Nile red). I've never been a fan of the image of ""God with his mighty rod smiting things"". I truly believe that God uses natural occurrences to work his miracles, so I liked that. A kernel of something interesting in the midst of dreck.After this film bombs (I can't see any reason it won't), I am no longer being sucked into the ""Hollywood Bible Epic"" hoopla anymore. Until a studio has the guts to tell a Bible story right, I don't want to sit through these terrible interpretations any longer. I had high, high hopes for ""Exodus"" (especially with the casting of Bale), but it ended up being just as bad as Noah (in some ways even worse). I guess old Charlton Heston is still the standard here.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
46,Floated2,Dull and overly long,2,9 May 2020,"Having little knowledge of the backstory of this film, and not caring overly much about these certain historical biblical period piece dramas. Found Exodus to be quite boring at many parts, overly long and dragging on in several instances. There were a few scenes which sparked some interest but overall, this was not a great watch.

47,eddie_baggins,Scott's visually stunning epic is an emotionless event,4,4 December 2014,"All creative persons/artists go through a creative funk, it's just part  and parcel of the business they're in. Whether it be a writer who  suffers from the dreaded writers block, an actor that can't seem to buy  a hit or a painter that can't seem to replicate the images in their  heads, the creative lulls affect all. Famed British director Ridley  Scott, the visionary master behind such classics as Alien, Blade Runner  and Gladiator has found himself in one of these creative dead zones,  but the most telling thing about his time in this lowly state is that  his been there for the better part of a decade and after witnessing his  new cashed up epic Exodus, it seems he is destined to remain there for  the foreseeable future.   Exodus is one of the most telling examples of storytelling mediocrity  overshadowing impeccable production values that I've ever seen and it  would be hard for anyone to argue against the pure visual value present  on screen in what is a clearly lavishly splurged upon epic. From  monuments through to the slums of the slave's right down to the extra  clad streets, Exodus brims to life with a detailed and often incredible  visual palette. While the wonders of the on screen production will  consistently make you look twice, there seems like such little point to  an exercise like this when all is surrounded by a script that never  allows us in, alongside Scott directing proceedings like a man that  wants to show off but not engage, direction more concerned with how to  spectacularly kill of horses than making the characters and story come  to life.   Much has been made in the media of late surrounding the casting of  actors in Exodus but more importantly to movie goers it's important to  know just how tame the acting turns are here. Christian Bale makes for  a watchable yet not entirely memorable Moses, his incarnation has  moments of brief humanity but he feels more a caricature than a living  breathing embodiment of one of the Bibles most well-known figures, we  feel tiny bits of the weight Moses had on his shoulders, yet our care  towards him remains dangerously low. On the other end of the spectrum  Australian Joel Edgerton (in perhaps his biggest Hollywood gig yet)  fails to deliver on what should've been a glorious big screen villain  in the form of Rhamses. All eyeliner and grizzled looks, Edgerton fails  to convince in his role and it feels from the get go that sadly he  may've been miscast much like John Turturoo's Seti, Aaron Paul's Joshua  and Ben Kinglsey's Nun, even the usually scene stealing Ben Mendelsohn  as Hegep fails to make much of a mark which leaves the film but a few  genuine moments of memorability, that being all largely related to the  onset of the plagues.   Impressive visuals, stunning sets and some genuinely wow inducing  moments concerning the plagues aren't enough to save this emotionally  void epic from a giant wave of the mundane. Scott sure knows how to  conduct his production department and his sweeping camera sure can  capture some outstanding action but the one time storyteller has lost  sight of how to portray his characters, how to play out a story and  Exodus looks set to become another Scott failure that looks likely to  underwhelm audiences as well as Box Office's the world over.   2 shades of eyeliner out of 5",Exodus - Gods and Kings
48,leonblackwood,Expected much better from Ridley! 3/10,3,7 June 2015,"Review: This film took me hours to watch because I kept on falling asleep. I found the film extremely boring and I gave up trying to understand what the hell was going on. I thought that there was going to be epic battles and loads of Spartacus type anger but it's mostly about Moses being guided by a child figure to free slaves and take on Ramses, who used to be his closest friend. Ridley Scott has got into the habit of making these long epic movies which seem to become a drag after a while. You can definitely see were the $140million budget was spent because the film does look great but I personally got fed up with it after a while. The acting isn't that bad and Christian Bale isn't over acting for once but the characters weren't that interesting. I liked the relationship between Ramses and Moses at the beginning of the film but once Ramses finds out that Moses is a Hebrew, it goes terribly downhill and the epic journey just goes on forever. I'm sure that this story would have been much better if it was in another directors hands because Ridley Scott was concentrating on elements which were not that entertaining. Boring!Round-Up: What has happened to Ridley Scott lately? After directing Alien, Blade Runner and the epic Gladiator, he has gone downhill with movies like the Counseller, Robin Hood and Kingdom of Heaven. I wasn't that impressed with Prometheus, even though it made a lot of money at the box office and after seeing a few interviews with him talking about his methods, he seems to have a bad attitude which must be hard to work with. The same goes for Christian Bale who wasn't that bad in this film because he took a natural approach to his character, not like in Batman when he was putting on that awful voice. Joel Eggerton was the best thing in the film but we really did get to see that much of him. The makeup was awful and most of the butch characters seemed camp and dismissive. Anyway, I really didn't enjoy this film and I honestly think that it's hype and great distribution which made it make so much money at the box office. Budget: $140million Worldwide Gross: $270millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their epic adventure/drama/action movies about Moses taking on Ramses with the help of the gods. 3/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Ridley Scott's direction is epic has the movie. And the setting makes the audience feels like your there. And it is visually stunning. And sometimes you'll feel uncomfortable in some scenes, but I guess that was the point.Christian Bale has Moses I feel like he is sleepwalking through most of this, but for little scenes he's great, but for big scenes he looks like he just giving a dragging performance. Now Joel Edgerton really plays Ramases with such great sutler evilness, I think he plays it better than Bale. Although I did like this movie, but Son Of God was better.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
50,PWNYCNY,Refreshing and controversial reinterpretation of the biblical story.,10,17 December 2014,"This movie is not an updated version of the 1956 movie The Ten Commandments. Instead it offers a new interpretation of the biblical story of the exiting of the Hebrews from Egypt. This movie tells the story not as a biblical epic but as an action/adventure. Instead of being a morality tale, with forces of good and bad clearly delineated, the story rather is about who will win in a struggle for power. Throughout the movie, Moses' actual identity remains ambiguous. Even Moses himself is never certain of it. What he is certain of, however, is that his foster brother, Rameses II, tried to kill him. And this is where this movie and the 1956 movie diverge the furthest. Whereas in the former Rameses is portrayed stereotypically as the personification of evil, in this movie his character is much more developed. This movie portrays a Pharaoh who in many respects is a victim of circumstances. The plagues, which are a result of divine intervention, are now presented as result of natural occurrences. The question is: at what point will Rameses connect these plagues to his policy toward the the slaves? In the 1956 movie the audience knows why Rameses is being punished: he has incurred the wrath of the Lord. In this movie, such a connection is at best tenuous. In this movie God's messenger is represented as a child. This has significant psychological meaning. Moses feels guilty over having left his family, and so when communing with the child, he is in effect communing with his son, Gershon. This implies that Moses is psychotic. As for Rameses, once he decides that the slaves are more of liability than an asset, he frees them. Moses wins but his victory is qualified because now he has to take on the responsibility for guiding an entire nation, which means he can become another Pharaoh. This fear is not unfounded because his political legitimacy ever fully established. Indeed, his mental state is always a question. As for Rameses, he is left vanquished, but his kingdom, though battered, still intact. Who really wins is a coin toss. As for the performances, Christian Bale turns in a masterful performance as Moses. It is impossible to fairly compare his performance with that of Charlton Heston's. Except for the name, both portray two entirely different characters. The same applies to Joel Edgerton's excellent portrayal as Rameses II. Edgerton's Rameses is complex, three-dimensional person who is neither wanton nor corrupt, but is driven to extreme measures by circumstances beyond his control. The most dramatic moment in the movie is when Rameses's son dies. Here Rameses, and Neferteri, are in torment, their loss so profound as to defy words. Later on Rameses, not without justification, asks Moses, what kind of people can worship a god that kills children. Moses can only reply that Hebrew children did not die which evades the question and just further infuriates Rameses and gives cause to wonder who's worse, Moses's or Rameses?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
51,stevendbeard,Good Effects Bad Execution,6,12 December 2014,"I saw ""Exodus:Gods and Kings"", starring Christian Bale-the Dark Knight movies, Shaft_2000; Joel Edgerton-Zero Dark Thirty, The Thing_2011; Sigourney Weaver-The Cold Light of Day, The Village and Ben Kingsley- Iron Man 3, Species.This is another big budget biblical movie, much like this years' Noah but this one is a little better than that one-remember the rock Transformers? Christian plays Moses, a half brother to Ramses, played by Joel, who just happens to be the Egyptian Pharaoh Seti's son. Christian and Joel are raised as brothers and even fight as generals in the army but, no matter what, Joel is recognized as the true successor. Joel becomes king after his father dies and then he banishes Christian after he discovers that Christian is actually a Hebrew/Jew-unbeknownst to just about everyone, including Christian. You see, the Egyptians use the Hebrews as slaves because they see them as beneath them in status. After Christian switches sides he decides to lead his fellow Hebrews in a revolt against his half brother Joel-he was a general, remember?-and then lead his people to the promised land. Sigourney plays Joel's mother and Ben plays a Hebrew/slave that befriends Christian and fills him in about his Jewish heritage. The effects are pretty good. There are the famous biblical depictions; rivers running red, plagues of frogs and locusts and the burning bush. The movie itself is not real preachy. When Christian is talking to the power from above-which is represented here as a little boy-it is often shown that he might be just hallucinating after having had a bump on his head. Anyone seeing him converse with the boy just sees Christian talking to himself. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 30 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
52,estebangonzalez10,A disappointing adaptation from the talented Ridley Scott,5,6 January 2015,"""Follow me and you will be free. Stay and you will perish.""Ridley Scott is always a director to look forward to when it comes to films. I know he has had his series of misses as of late, but with films like Alien and Blade Runner under his belt, you know his next film could become a classic. Alien is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time and I even enjoyed Scott's recent prequel, Prometheus, more than most audiences did. Exodus isn't the first time Scott has tried to make an epic film because it is similar in scope to what he did with Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, and Robin Hood. Unfortunately, Exodus is the weakest of the four in my opinion. Scott has also experimented with different genres and last year's The Counselor was proof of that. He's even made some smaller films which I really enjoyed such as Matchstick Men which I was a huge fan of. I appreciate these smaller scale films more than when he tries to make these grandiose and epic ones. My major issue with this film revolves around the pacing because it felt so long and dull for most parts. It was as if Scott was aiming to direct an ambitious epic film and was trying to make it so grand that he got lost with the production and visuals of it and left out the actual narrative. There are several things I'd like to get out of the way before I actually review this film. First of all, if you are expecting a faithful adaptation to the Biblical story then Exodus isn't a movie for you because Scott and the screenwriters took several liberties of their own (especially in the way Moses interacted with God and the Pharaoh). This is the second big budget film based on the Old Testament to come out last year, after Aronofsky directed Noah, which both took liberties from the original source material but in my opinion at least Aronofsky did something fresh and unique with the material, while Scott never manages to do so. Second, I don't understand why we complaint so much about the casting of white actors and forget about the fact that the characters are all speaking in English. What is the point of casting all Egyptian and Hebrew actors and have them speak in English? At least Scott went all in and just cast famous actors without considering anything else.It took me a while to get over the silliness of the opening sequences. On the one hand, Scott made a huge effort of recreating the Egyptian empire with huge production sets, but on the other the familiar faces of the actors kind of took me out of the film. Having John Turturro playing the Pharaoh and Sigourney Weaver his wife was difficult to visualize. I think Joel Edgerton is a great actor, but he wasn't the right man for the role of Ramses. Christian Bale delivers as Moses and Ben Mendelssohn has the most campy scenes in the film but I think they helped to break the tedious tone of the film. Aaron Paul and Ben Kingsley are inexplicably underused. Despite the nice visuals (I don't think they were groundbreaking), the story was poorly written and that is perhaps why some of these incredible actors didn't have much to work with. There are some moments in the film where Moses is given some humanity, but whatever depth they tried to give the characters got lost in the visuals and the narrative. We know the story and have seen it played out several times in films before, so that is perhaps why I found some of the engaging scenes rather tedious because Scott doesn't really do anything unique with the material. By the time the plagues take place we really don't care for the characters and aren't emotionally invested in them either. Yes, the scenes look great but there is nothing more there. I also expected a lot more from the parting of the Red Sea, but it simply was a forgettable scene. The only moment I felt some sort of emotion toward this dull film was with the dedication to his brother Tony during the end credits, but the film didn't actually do anything for me. Skip the movie, read Exodus instead.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
53,iquine,Inaccurate,4,29 June 2017,"(Flash Review)I was anticipating a cool and visually stunning movie, with the climax most likely being Moses parting the Red Sea to save his people. While it was epic in production and length, it failed to grab you and emotionally involve you. Partially, because it looked overly CGI, miscasting that took you out of the scene, inaccurate stories and I'm not even a biblical expert. The Moses and God interactions were unusual. How anyone believes Sigourney Weaver to be of that ethnic heritage, anywhere nearby is beyond me. The production was the highlight but the script was off as well as filled with cliché action scenes. Don't bother.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
54,arthur_tafero,Better Than Average Sword and Sandal- Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,30 August 2019,"Ridley Scott is a master of special effects and action. There is plenty of both in this film. There is also a dearth of screenwriting and adaptation, unfortunately, and it holds back the film from being a few notches higher. It is not as good as Gladiator, and not as good as the original Ten Commandments, which had very few special effects, actually. The special effects in this film bury the original, but are buried by the mundane performances of the actors. Mr. Bale is really not up to the level of acting required for this role. John Tutturo was very good, however. But the worst miscasting was for Ramses (the ghost of Yul Brenner must be spinning in his grave). That portrayal was God-awful and kept the film from A status. Ben Kingsley gives it his Edward G Robinson best shot at a small role, and does all right, but where is your Messiah now, NYAH? Why not include Billy Crystal in the fillm; he would have been a better Ramses than the one that played him. Egyptians didnt have a British accent, eh what? The mountain side scene was the best in the film for me; great filmmaking, but not quite enough to make up for the serious writing problems. When will Hollywood learn to spend at least 1% on good writing. For 1.5 million, you could get Shakespeare to write the damn thing. Despite all these misfirings, Scott single-handedly pulled off a better than average epic. There have been several that have been worse, but there has also been several that were better.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

56,3xHCCH,Disappointing Biblical Debacle,4,9 December 2014,"This film tackles a story that had already been tackled very well in previous films. The most famous of them all is the epic ""The Ten Commandments"" with Charlton Heston as the definitive Moses. Other filmmakers have tried to replicate this Moses story with different actors or even in animation, but the 1956 classic remains secure in its place. This year, yet another attempt is made by director Ridley Scott with big star Christian Bale as Moses, a combination is too promising to ignore. So despite the lukewarm to negative early reviews, I wanted to see and judge this film for myself.We all know the story of Moses from the book of Exodus. He was a Hebrew who grew up in the Egyptian palace side by side with Pharaoh's own son Ramses. When Moses' real origin was revealed, he was exiled. There in the wilderness, he obeys God's orders by way of the burning bush to return to Egypt to ask the new Pharaoh to set the Hebrews free from slavery. Only after God sent ten dreadful plagues did Ramses relent. Moses led the Hebrews across the Red Sea and into the Promised Land of milk and honey.This film is basically faithful with the biblical story, with the advantage of higher technology in special visual effects to create grander vistas and more realistic plagues. It tried to inject some scientific logic into the supernatural events, particularly the Red Sea crossing. However, the explanation for the turning of water into blood was quite a stretch. Moses did not have a staff that turned into a snake nor part the Red Sea. The Angel of Death scenes were presented curiously just like the way it was done on ""The Ten Commandments""!The lackluster portrayal by the actors added to the coldness of the film. I don't know if Christian Bale did not make a very good Moses. He felt like he was going through the motions here, no passion whatsoever. Joel Edgerton was totally wrong as Ramses. He looked ill at ease the whole film, and it was obvious from the posters alone! The presence of Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver and Aaron Paul in cast were wasted in small unremarkable roles. Some people may expect this to be a religious film. However, the whole film felt soul-less, and this made the long 150-minute running time seem so unbearably slow. The very way God was portrayed did not sit very well with me. God in this film was personified as an imperious young boy who was projected to be mercilessly violent and vindictive. There was no hint of compassion nor magnanimity here. Moses was even arguing against God. The film felt like it had an anti-God undertone, even atheistic, which was uncomfortable for me. This is yet another disappointing Biblical film debacle this year, though I would not consider as bad as the total disaster that was ""Noah"". 4/10.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
57,drystyx,"Why even call this ""Exodus""?",3,7 October 2021,"Obviously, there can hardly be spoilers for this, unless someone says there could be a spoiler for the story of the biblical Exodus.I guess I could say that's a spoiler, since this really isn't much of a story of the biblical Exodus, but I won't call it a spoiler.Some of the same events are kind of toyed with here, perhaps in a effort to explain the events that may have occurred and then were written about, but this story is a pretty ridiculous stretch in an attempt to show some natural and supernatural intermingling that doesn't even follow the pattern of the book.All this would be okay, if one just wanted to watch a modern day sword and sandals movie.But there are other problems. First, it is ""modern"" from head to tail. You never get the feel that it happened in B. C.. Instead, you never lose the feeling that it is Hollywood actors portraying characters on stage.Why is this? A lot of it is from the contrived story line, but most of it is from the lack of credible motivation, particularly in the two main characters.Moses, in particular, doesn't behave in a way that is ancient. He is written as a 21st century man proud of his lack of motivation to explain his character. There is no barbarity, no instinct, no sense of a man who is living thousands of years ago. This ""Moses"" is a man who plays video games and drives a motor vehicle to and from rehearsals.If this would just be its own story, it could pass muster, but even then it wouldn't be a great story. It tries. The actors try. Everyone involved tries, but the problem lies in the script itself.It isn't a horrible film. It's just a failure at story telling, and a bit of an embarrassment to all involved. It's quite forgettable, and in my book, ""forgettable"" is the main criteria for a 3/10 rating.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
58,aharmas,Moses: A Man in Transition,9,14 December 2014,"Ridley Scott is a director who understands epic storytelling, and he can't be blamed for not giving us an accurate portrayal of a famous historical figure since there's no complete account of his life and deeds. We get a few pages, and the rest is open to interpretation. From the beginning Scott sticks to what he can handle best, and he gives us an exquisite introduction to what the physical world of 1500 BC must have been for both the upper and lower classes. We are treated to breathtaking reproductions of the buildings and statues that populated the magnificent metropolis. It is indeed a great introduction to this tale.He doesn't stop here, and we see the military power of Egypt as both Moses and Ramses set out to conquer the enemy, not without a bit of some troubling information as a high priestess speaks of a prophecy that is complex and disturbing. During this part of the movie it becomes clear that there is a strong bond between the two princes. It is also apparent that Moses might an advantage on his way to the throne. There is a bit of confusion about the pharaoh's death, but Ramses succeeds him, keeping Moses as his most important adviser.Things change, and Moses soon finds himself in exile and alive, apparently with Ramses' support. Moses marries, but destiny calls him, and he's back in Egypt, ready to liberate his people with the help of a god who is tired of the Egyptians abusive treatment of the Hebrews for the last 400 years.It's during this section where I expect to hear the most controversies arise because there is much explanation as to how the plagues occurred, some of them with some strong logical support. Still, there is room for the unexplained powers of a being that is at best unstoppable when he becomes wrathful and in some people's opinion vengeful.Much of the movie succeeds because of the infinite amount of pride that went into recreating a long gone era, in an empire that must have surpassed many in their political and artistic power. We get the best production values, with beautiful cinematography, a great score, and most of the leads doing very good work. The young man playing the powerful entity certainly manages to upstage Bale, who as usual, doesn't fail to deliver.The effects are flawless, and it is amazing to see how the previous incarnation of these stories will suffer in comparison, but jaws are certain to drop while seeing the fury of the insect plagues and the level of destruction and death brought upon all that lived in Egypt at the time.On the way out I heard comments that criticized the film as not being faithful to the real story. I thought to myself that nowhere in recorded history it said that Egyptian palaces were lit with light bulbs, and queens were dressed by the latest fashion designer, with a touch of art deco. Yes, Baxter was sensational as the spurned queen, but I found these portrayal as much, much realistic, as we see despair and confusion fight the loyalty and devotion that comes from being family for so long, and how an identity crisis is going to be at least problematic for many.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
59,peterp-450-298716,A religious topic but sadly enough nothing new.,4,20 March 2015,"""Follow me and you will be free. Stay and you will perish."" I have a feeling that the Catholic Church has done quite a bit of lobbying in Hollywood,after noticing that their fan-base started to dwindle.First there was the biblical story ""Noah"" with the famous boat builder who started constructing a huge ark,insisted by ""The guy upstairs"",just so he and his family could withstand the announced tidal wave together with a pair of every animal species.And now they even convinced Ridley Scott to make a film of the incomparable epic story of Moses who guided his people through the desert to absolute freedom (It's clear he hasn't pointed out the right place,because they still haven't found the right spot).Ultimately,this film won't convert me (it didn't appeal to me either),but I did expect great things from this pimped version of ""The ten commandments"" from 1956.In the end it was just a boring spectacle in which the whole bag of CGI tricks,special effects and contemporary modern camera technology was opened,to ensure a stunning visual show.I couldn't find any added value compared with the original film from 1956.Indeed,it was dead boring and disappointing with some non-impressive performances in comparison with those from ""The Ten Commandments"".Writing a spoiler-free review for a film like ""Exodus"" isn't really difficult,because most of us know the initial story.In contrast to the story in the Bible with everything miraculous,wondrous and divine described,this film looks at it from a scientific perspective.There's a meaningful explanation for every Egyptian plague.Even the highlight with the Red Sea didn't look as if the hand of God was in play.As Scott announced it himself,the intention was to give all miracles a scientific twist.Similarly,the big trick with the Red Sea.A giant tsunami caused a drawback of the Red Sea.As a realist,I can live with this,and it's a more plausible explanation for the course of events. As an avid movie lover,this was a rather disappointing choice.In my honest opinion this ruined the magic of the movie.To be honest,my high expectations about this scene made sure I persisted in looking further to this rather miserable-long film.I was expecting an impressive fragment (compared to that of the film of 1956) but was treated to an empty,muddy seabed (and judging by the immense noise of the flying birds,it was swarming with air gasping fish) which got flooded again by huge tidal waves.So it wasn't an impressive moment with a sea opening itself.Waiting impatiently for this moment was just a waste of effort.The performances by Christian Bale (Moses) and Joel Edgerton (Ramses) were sometimes flatly embarrassing and totally unconvincing.Bale really wasn't believable as the famous Moses.As would-be Egyptian,he looked youthful and virile in the beginning.Like Moses,he also looked like a virile person,but with a fake beard.Also,he wasn't confident and he even dared to accuse God of going too far.Compare him with Charlton Heston.Now THAT was a real Moses:his stature,the impressive beard,that appearance and he was a perfect example what leadership is all about.Also Edgerton as the cruel ruler Ramses looked downright ridiculous.The moment he lays aside his dangerous sword, being part of ""The Village People"" wouldn't be out of place with the thick applied mascara and his shiny bald head.Remember Yul Brynner! Yes,he looked like a dangerous and cruel Egyptian pharaoh.For the supporting roles they recruited some big names like Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley,Aaron Paul and John Turturro.Obviously neither cost nor effort was spared and this served merely to give the whole spectacle a Hollywood status.The only one who didn't disappoint me was Kingsley, although there is a little wear on the routine of facial expressions by him.Is there anything positive to report? Yes of course.Visually it is a feast for the eyes:the whole decor,the costumes,Memphis and the surrounding slums were impressive on screen,the monuments and the ongoing labor,the mandatory large-scale battle scenes (I got that ""The Lords of the ring"" feeling again),the Egyptian plagues look slick and some images are real gems.The subtle interpretations of the biblical story,were surprising.Firstly, He-who-always-talks-with-a-reverberating-voice is represented by an irritating young boy who speaks with a British accent (Not an uninspired burning bush).He's a real brat who gets terribly worked up when his demands aren't met.I'm not a religious type and certainly no expert when it comes to the content of the Bible,but I'm pretty sure that while His Holiness let the 10 plagues rage over Egypt,he still was working on the 10 Commandments,because the rule ""Thou shalt not kill"" and the concept of ""to love thy neighbor"" wasn't applied here. The term ""turn the other cheek"" apparently wasn't customary either.He rather used the slogan ""an eye for an eye,a tooth for a tooth"" I guess.But that's a subject for a theological debate.Furthermore,I think it's wonderful that Moses had to chisel the 10 commandments into the stone tablets himself,instead of ""The Big Chief"" using some lightning.Yet I ask myself why Ridley Scott,still one of my favorite directors who produced a series of superb films (Alien,Blade Runner,Gladiator, Hannibal,Black Hawk Down,Matchstick Men,Prometheus) at the age of 77 years has chosen this project.Maybe he wanted to come to terms with God! Conclusion:a visually successful film but substantively it's as empty as the desert during a hot summer.The only thing they need to make is a soft erotic drama about Sodom and Gomorrah,a thriller about the fate of Lot and an adventurous movie about Samson and Delilah,and I think they would have covered the most thrilling parts of the Bible.PS. It's certainly not my intention to offend those who believe.Who am I to judge if believing is a good or a bad thing.That would make me God,God forbid.But let me quote Ridley:""Religion is the source of all evil.Everyone is tearing each other apart in the name of their personal God"".Ultimately, this film will cause a fuss among the devout audience.For me it was simply a simple story.More reviews here:http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Exodus - Gods and Kings
60,adamjohns-42575,"Believe it or not, it's Ridley?",2,16 February 2021,"Anyone for some Ham and Cheese? Ok, it's slightly better than 'Gods Of Egypt', but that's not hard.
Allegedly the Director's Cut is 4 hours long, perhaps all the bits that were cut out were the good bits? I would hope at least that the film makes more sense with all that extra footage. I could just tell that it has been butchered in the editing suite.Now I'm not someone who ever attended Sunday School or paid attention in Religious Education lessons if I even turned up to them, but even I have heard of Moses. However without knowing his origin story, the bit with the basket, ya know? until halfway through, I didn't realise that it was that Moses we were watching a film about.I spent most of the time on Wikipedia refreshing my memory on Mo's biblical antics and found that this film had not only missed out huge chunks, but that it had also used a lot of artistic license in its production.Starting as the cousin of Ramses II (Not the actual Pharaoh from the original novel) it does follow Mo, who is banished and confronted by ""God"" or at least a very weird child as a messenger or something, before starting a war with Ram to free the slaves. If you know the bible, it does loosely continue with what is printed there, but with those huge gaps.
Actually, if anything, it goes out of its way to disprove the divine intervention element, by explaining the science behind the plagues, etc.There are also moments when it moves forward in time and we just have to guess that that is the case.The cast are pretty awful and the ones with any experience, Ben K and Sigourney barely get any lines. Mother didn't even spot that Sigourney was in it.Let's put it this way, I don't think there will be many R.E. Teachers using this to teach the story of Moses.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
61,Seraphion,A real disappointment due to the bad story,6,16 December 2014,"The movie starts with Moses and Ramesses at a war council meeting discussing the Hittites threat. The Pharaoh Seti consults his shaman for a prophecy, which tell that a leader will get his life saved, and that the savior will lead. Moses and Ramesses ride to battle against the Hittites and Moses saves Ramesses from the Hittites rampaging chariot. Soon Moses volunteers to pay an inspection visit to the viceroy at Phitom where he sees the Hebrew slaves. There the slave elders reveal Moses' true identity as a Hebrew, which he rejects at first. He kills the Egyptian guards eavesdropping the elders. Returning to Memphis, Seti passes away and Ramesses succeeds him. Tipped by informants, the viceroy tells Ramesses of Moses. He confronts Moses and Miriam of it, resulting in Moses being exiled. Moses finds a wife and starts a family in his exile. One day Moses goes to the village's forbidden mountain and there he finds God, who tells him to go back to Egypt. Despite his wife's disagreement, Moses goes back to the Hebrew slaves. Moses even goes, silently, to Ramesses demanding the Pharaoh to free the Hebrews, to the Pharaoh's rejection. Moses continues on teaching the Hebrews military skills until God talks to him and says that he should watch what He'll do. The ten plagues strike Egypt. The Pharaoh's experts scientifically explains to him about the plagues cause, until Moses visits Ramesses again, saying he should protect his son. The last plague struck, all Egyptian firstborns die. The next day Ramesses let the Hebrews go. But then some time later he gets his army ready and give chase at the Hebrews. Moses lead the Hebrews through the mountain pass but then he realizes that he mistook his way. The Hebrews are trapped between the sea and Ramesses' army. But after Moses speaks to God, the fast current dries out the sea and the Hebrews cross it. But soon tornado gales blow the water back to it's lace. Ramesses give chase relentlessly. Losing men on the treacherous mountain pass doesn't stop him. The roiling seas engulf his army and wipe them out. Moses then returns to pick up his family to join the journey back to Canaan.Okay, I should admit I have a mixed perception about this movie. From the technicality standpoint, beside the over-dependence on CGI, this movie proves to be a well done piece of artwork. But this movie has great flaws stemming from the most critical aspect of it's development, the story. The writers really wreck the classic story into one heck of a mess. Well, I guess that's what you'll get when you team up three under experienced writers with only Steven Zaillian to have some mind for a good story.The story is quite a train wreck for me. The writers, and even Ridley Scott should have known better about the risks when doing this kind of biblical based stories into a movie adaptation. Even more, they have titles such as The Ten Commandments (1956) and Prince of Egypt (1998) which set the bar for them, and the clamor caused by Aronofsky's Noah earlier this year. Yet they continue on with this overly re-interpreted version of the story of Moses.The movie overly humanizes the characters, including Moses and even God. Adding in the logical consequence of Moses being raised in the Pharaoh's courts is nice at first. But then takes too much of the movie's duration. The I AM God being humanized as a young boy seems quite a good approach to depict the closeness Moses and God. But then as the movie continues, it omits largely omits God from the entire picture as there's no depiction of the original dialog between Moses and God, no depiction of the gestures Moses did before the Pharaohto bring each plague to existence.This movie can also be a dangerous deviation for Christian faith especially to those yarning for a live action depiction of the classic story. It's because the story depiction is so different in details than the original in the Bible. Trading the cane with a sword, reducing Aaron into the background, changing the cause of Moses killing the guards are some of relatively minor yet important details differed from the original story. This could alter the perception to the story if we are not well rooted in the Bible.From the acting side, I think it's just as expected from those great caliber names of cast. What's bad is not the acting itself. Rather the acting portions of each characters. The rest of the important characters are reduced to a minor significance; Aaron doesn't accompany Moses to face the Pharaoh, Joshua and even his father Nun only depicted as clueless characters, asking to many questions most of the time. Whereas, Joshua and Nun are played y ell known names of Aaron Paul and Ben Kingsley respectively. It really sets the bar down since the viewers were anticipating to see Ben Kingsley as the cruel Pharaoh Seti. Sigourney Weaver didn't even need to be there as her character only had a few scenes and a small dialog.My final say for Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) is just a 6 out of 10 score from me, purely out of respect for the well done overall acting and those nice battle scenes. A recommendation is a not from me. Honestly it's been quite a disappointment for me that this movie bears big names on the cast members and the director's seat yet it surprises by having quite a crappy reinterpreted version of the story which tells the fundamental point of faith for some people.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
62,richard-1787,"Visually impressive, but forget much of the dialog",5,12 December 2014,"I went to see this movie this afternoon at the bargain matinée such that my ticket cost less than my popcorn. I think that was about right.The visuals are often impressive, the crossing of the Red Sea at the end a triumph of modern computer animation.But the dialog is a mish-mash of different styles, sometimes downright disconcertingly so. At one point, for example, Ramses, talking about the financial implications of freeing the Hebrews, sounds like a modern economist.None of the characters comes alive as a real person, not even Moses, so there is really no human drama to catch you up.Enjoy the visuals. But I can't imagine seeing this movie more than once, and I definitely can't imagine renting it to watch at home. On the screen at the brand-new Cinemark in Cuyahoga Falls where I saw it, the visuals were remarkable. On my TV I suspect they would look like nothing.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
63,rannynm,Grand! Truly The Most Epic Version Of The Story Of Moses,10,10 December 2014,"Not only does this film teach you about one of the most important things in Jewish history, it tells one of the greatest stories history has to offer. Exodus: Gods and Kings is a masterpiece that everybody should watch. This film combines a story about religion with a sense of history, while still having a touch of action, suspense and even a perfect sprinkle of romance. This movie is about an Egyptian prince named Moses that gets exiled from Egypt when it is discovered that Moses is Hebrew (Jewish). After surviving through a long travel, he starts a new life, gets married and has a child. One day, he climbs a mountain that is known as God's mountain, where he gets knocked out and has an encounter with God who tells him to go to Egypt and free his people - the Jewish slaves, and take them back to the promise land.This movie is stupendous! Of course it will appeal to Jewish people for this is a very big part of Jewish history, but I recommend this film for everybody. This tells a truly remarkable story about one man freeing four hundred thousand slaves from the Egyptian Empire with the help of what he believes to be God. While this is a whopping two hour long film, I didn't want it to end. This story is one that requires time to tell it and is truly inspiring. On a personal note, as a Jew, this film helped me understand my culture better and, in a way, to live through this journey with the characters. This film makes me want to do more and find out more about this part of history. My favorite scene is when Moses climbs this mountain that is known to be God's and, after getting knocked out when rocks fall on him, he wakes up to a bush on fire. A boy that turns out to be God is standing in front of him, building a small pyramid out of little stone cubes and telling Moses to free his people, implying free the Jewish people from Egypt. This movie is very mature. It takes a look at a very violent time in history. So, I would recommend it to ages 13 to 18. I also give it 5 out 5 stars for fantastic acting, directing, producing and breath- taking backgrounds and sets. If you have a chance to see this film in 3D, I strongly recommend it because the quality of the film is absolutely breathtaking. I hope that creators will continue with the rest of the books that are offered by Torah. Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
64,Rob_Taylor,Exoduff...,4,3 March 2015,"So, I am not religious at all. I did the usual studies in school, like everyone of my generation, but I was just not into it.That said, I have no real problem with movies based on the Biblical stories. I view them with no more inherent dislike than any other action fantasy film.However... when you have an established story, I do kind of appreciate any retelling at least getting the story right and, from what I recall of the Moses story from my childhood, Exodus doesn't really do that.Sure, there are the various plagues and the overall story is the same, but it seemed they changed a lot of details just for no reason at all.For instance, there is one scene that sticks out in my mind involving giant, man-eating crocodiles! No, I really mean that! That scene is in here, but somehow I don't recall it from Religious Studies.Also, in the process of watching the movie there are very few non-white actors and those that are in the film are only in the bit part scenes. Everyone is white! Apparently, one of the plagues visited on Egypt in this movie was a rain of bleach! In addition, God is represented in the movie by a small boy. Who thought this was a good idea? Not blaming the kid actor here, but he comes across as a petulant, spoiled child for the most part and I can't help wondering if this was some deliberate commentary by the writer on the nature of God.So what's good about the film? Well, production values are high and the visuals are top notch. Acting is reasonable, though I am thinking Bale has taken the Keanu Reeves class in playing the same character over and over again. Somehow it works for Keanu, but not for Bale.If you are not religious, it is an okay film, I guess, but it is far from a classic.I doubt anyone will invest the time to watch this more than once, even once it hits the TV. There isn't really any ""Epic"" feel to it, unlike the movies of the 50's and 60's.This is the second Ridley Scott movie I've been disappointed by. The other being Prometheus. Seems like he has lost his knack for picking winners these days.SUMMARY: Overblown, with no real sense of excitement or drama. Purely by the numbers movie that could have benefited from an accountant to point out that 2 plus 2 equals four, not three as it does here. Dull and pedestrian but at least it was better than Noah.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
65,moviexclusive,"Epic in sheer spectacle, Scott's Biblical retelling of the story of the Exodus lacks a compelling focus on its lead character Moses",7,11 December 2014,"How do you get people to listen to you tell a story that they already know the ending to, or worse, have heard countless times before? Ridley Scott's answer to that, in the case of his swords- and-scandals epic based upon the well-known Biblical tale, is spectacle. Indeed, in 'Exodus: Gods and Kings', Scott has spared no expense to make sure that Egypt comes vividly to life, or that the ten plagues are given as much luscious detail as necessary, or that the parting of the Red Sea is a truly humbling sight to behold – so much so that even the most imaginative mind will probably be awed over by the sheer spectacle that he has conjured. Yes, if there's one thing that Scott has succeeded in doing with his Old Testament blockbuster, it is in reminding both believers and non-believers alike just how remarkable and awe-inspiring the mighty hand and power God wields over the elements of nature and the fates of men.Against such gargantuan forces, the question remains: is there room for the individual to matter? God's plan certainly did – as believers will tell you, his plans of salvation through the ages have always rested on the faiths of individual men and women who were willing to put aside their doubts and trust wholeheartedly in the providence of their almighty Creator. So it is with this tale, that God's plan of salvation for the Israelites would rest on one man, Moses – a logical thinker and in Scott's interpretation here, an agnostic – who would be challenged through visions to recognise his Hebrew identity, and in doing so, embrace his role in that grand plan as the leader of God's people.Unfortunately, not even a quartet of writers (Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine and Oscar winner Steven Zaillian) have been able to ensure that the man isn't drowned out in Scott's show of spectacle. Not enough attention is paid to developing the brotherly bond between Moses and his half-brother Ramses, or their simmering rivalry arising from the aging Pharaoh's (John Turturro) favour of the former. Ditto for Moses' subsequent awakening to his lineage and to God's call through the 'burning bush' – neither of these turning points feel that they matter as much as they should. Most sorely however is how the screenplay fails to portray Moses' ambivalence towards God's methods, reduced simply to a couple of lines delivered with perfunctory angst by Christian Bale – ""You don't always agree with me,"" is as far as a response that the writers have managed to come up with.Lamentably so therefore, this fails to be – as it should – a story of one man as much as it is a story about God. Moses never quite comes to life despite being front and centre no thanks to an underdeveloped script that doesn't make the character as compelling as he should be, and worse, feeds him cringe-worthy lines from time to time that border on caricature. Bale is best when he is given a complex character to play, but since he isn't afforded that here, hardly cracks the surface of what could have been an intriguing and multi-faceted personality. The same in fact can be said of every other actor in Scott's ensemble – from Joel Edgerton as the eyeliner-drawn Ramses, to Ben Kingsley as a wise Jewish elder, and even to a barely-present Sigourney Weaver as the scheming pharaoh's wife Tuya, each one of the notable cast members struggles to rise above his or her thinly drawn role.Though the script lets him down, Scott's strengths as a director remain undiminished. An early attack by the Egyptians on the rival Hittites tribe camped outside the gates of Egypt showcases Scott's grasp of scale, thrillingly lensed by his regular d.p. Dariusz Wolski with a combination of soaring overhead shots and up close combat footage. Scott takes artistic license to interpret the ten plagues as a series of interconnected events, rather than as discrete happenings, which in turn allows him to not only build a smooth elegant narrative but also maintain a palpable feeling of tension throughout God's 'punishment' of the Israelites.His boldest choice as helmer however has to be his depiction of God, whom Moses first meets at the 'bush' and thereafter in the wilderness just before every major calamity. Scott cannot be ignorant of the implications of portraying God as a small young boy, but whether this is meant to represent the kind of disposition which God expects of his followers or to signify the capricious nature of God is left up to the viewer's interpretation. What is clear is that Scott keeps to an Old Testament God of wrath, so don't go expecting this God to be nice, calm or benign for that matter – and you'll probably do well to keep in mind that this is the God that has watched his people suffer in pain, blood and death the indignities that the Egyptians have lashed on them for the past 400 years.Unlike 'Noah' however, you can rest assured that Scott largely takes a much more conventional reading to the Biblical story; instead, Scott's intention is really to fashion a swords-and-scandals saga in the mould of 'Gladiator' by way of a well-known story with ostensible religious overtones. And in that regard, 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is an unvarnished triumph that will leave you awe-struck. Those who know the story will also recognise it as Moses' faith formation, and whether Scott's telling has that same transformative effect on his audience is necessarily suspect. But up till the very last frame where an elderly Moses finally arrives near the land of Canaan, you can be sure that there is never a dull moment to be found in this lavish, extravagant and yet oddly alienating epic that could do with a much more humanly centre.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
66,mike48128,The CGI is Great But the Whole Thing Just Falls Flat,7,22 April 2019,"Insert plagues here then return us to a long, drawn-out version of what should be an epic story. Alas, filmmaker Riddley Scott lays an egg. Portraying the image of God as an 11 year-old child? No pillars of fire? The only worthwhile changes involve Moses' love for his wife and his adopted brother, Ramses II. Like ""Scrooge"" this story has been filmed many times before. The only two versions I like are the 1956 De Mille extravaganza and Dreamwork's animated ""Prince of Eqypt."" Can you say different?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
67,tomsview,Chariot crash,5,25 February 2016,"I'm a bit of a fan of the old sword and sandal set. In fact I prefer historical movies to space operas, but ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is pretty heavy going.Of course Ridley Scott pulled off one of the best ancient movies of all time with ""Gladiator"" and I have always felt that ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was seriously underrated. But of late, Ridley's choice of stories seems questionable, and as for ""The Counselor"", I think he should have had his megaphone taken off him and been grounded for a month.""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is his take on the story of Moses and the exodus of the Jews from Egypt circa 1300 BC.A couple of things struck me about the film. The first is that it is so gloomy looking. It has spectacular scenes, but the CGI people have come up with an Egypt amazingly devoid of bright sunlight. Compare this puppy to Howard Hawk's ""Land of the Pharaohs""; totally inaccurate historically, but stunning to look at and sunny - I'm sure if they could have got away with it, all the extras would have been wearing Ray-Bans.The other big problem is the silly script, and I do mean silly. Some of the dialogue, especially when Ramesses II and the guys are making plans, sounds like suits thrashing it out on Madison Avenue. Maybe Ridley and the crew thought that was a modern equivalent of the way corporate types would have spoken back then, but it jars the ear - I'm surprised someone didn't slip in a reference to a hash tag along the way. Where's Robert Bolt when you need him? The acting is fine. Christian Bale gives us a Moses who doesn't take sh*t from anyone. A couple of Australians (Joel Edgerton and Ben Mendelsohn) have big parts, and what's a good sword and sandal without an Aussie involved? There was Russell in ""Gladiator""and Eric Bana in ""Troy"", but remember Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate and Herod Antipas back in the day? He could flounce a toga with the best of them.Apparently there was controversy over European actors being cast in the major roles as Egyptians and Hebrews in the movie. I think Ridley answered that when he pointed out that he needed big name stars to get finance. Besides that, I'm trying to think of a list of Egyptian stars the rest of the world would actually turn out to see in a Hollywood blockbuster now that Omar Sharif has joined the Pharaohs. Hmmm, I'm still thinking.Some of the scenes are impressive: crocodiles, frogs, chariots etc., but the attempt to give everything a rational, scientific explanation is laboured and humourless; we even have the archaeologist's beloved comet causing a tsunami effect on the Red Sea. All things considered, I fear ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" may have been cursed by the ancient Egyptian god with the turkey head. Oh, incidentally, I'm still thinking.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
68,Screen_Blitz,Ridley Scott has a vision but it just barely enough to redeem this biblical epic from it's sluggish narrative,5,14 January 2017,"It is nearly impossible to count how many times Hollywood has saw a re-imagining of the story of Moses, with the 1956 entry 'Ten Commandments' starring Charlton Heston being the most acclaimed. Taking from the pages of the Book of Exodus is time is visionary director Ridley Scott who has some fair experience with the epic action genre tracing back 'Gladiator' in 2000 followed 'Kingdom of Heaven' five years later. The director has made an incredible name for himself most often for his firm and atmospheric visual style. And whenever it takes the director's chair, the film is guaranteed to make for an eye-dazzling hit. This biblical epic starring Christian Bale in the lead role however, strays far from his usual filmmaking quality. Translated from the screenplay of four different writers, this big-budgeted epic sees the appealing flair of Ridley Scott's visual compulsion splashing on the screen, but not the narrative to lift it above the level of disposable entertainment. Set in 1300 B.C., this film follows the story of Moses (played by Christian Bale), a fellow Egyptian who witnesses the atrocities of slavery under the brutal ruling the Pharoh King Ramses a.k.a. his brother (played by Joel Edgerton). When he exiled from his home under the order of Queen Taya (played by Sigourney Weaver) upon him discovering his family's Hebrew heritage, Moses rallies Egypt's 600,000 slaves in a rebellion against Ramses in a desperate attempt to lead them to freedom.For an epic held as ""one of the greatest stories ever told"" being handled by a versatile director like Ridley Scott, many would expect this to be a powerful thrill ride if not a groundbreaking spectacle. Unfortunately, the only aspect keeping this biblical epic remotely resembling Ridley Scott's signature grandeur is it's dazzling visual appeal, from the striking production design of Ancient Egypt to the bombastic battle sequences. Demonstrated in the early battle sequence and the giant tsunami sequence, Ridley Scott gracefully shows his fixation for intense, special effects-heavy action set pieces; and they comfortably mark the film's most thrilling aspects. Everything else beyond this leads little be desired. The film explores the trajectory of the Bible's Book of Exodus from Moses's established brotherhood of the tyrant Pharoh King Ramses, to his romance with his wife Zipporah (played by Maria Valverde), to the ten plagues prophesized by God (complete with solid CGI bugs and locusts everywhere), to his climatic journey of leading the 600,000 Egyptians out of slavery. And Ridley Scott takes a daunting task of showcasing this in a 2 1/2 hour runtime, and the results is a story that proceeds at a sluggish pace and falls short of an emotional touch. The story is rarely engaging and more than often, grows tedious with climatic moments coming few and far in between. As the Book of Exodus is an exceptionally long story, it appears Ridley Scott and the writers struggle trying to cram the nearly the entire story into a 150 minutes worth of material.In terms of casting, Ridley Scott makes the controversial (though not uncommon) choice of white washing the roles of Egyptian figures in favor of Caucasian actors. The idea is understandably questionable unless you consider the difficulty of finding quality actors of the Middle Eastern descent. Igniting the role of lead figure Moses is Christian Bale who's portrayal is mostly solid throughout the picture but occasionally slips every now and then; nothing Oscar-worthy or groundbreaking. The character's emotional core comes his questioning his faith in God and his own personal flaws. His portrayal however, manages to take significant liberties from his signature portrayal from the Bible which will predictably raise heat for devout Christian, Catholics, and overall Church-goers. Playing the antagonist role of King Ramses is Joel Edgerton who appears with Egyptian eyeliner and completely shaved head in order to resemble his historical counterpart. His performance is fine, but again nothing special. The best performances the film manages to obtain comes from Ben Kingsley as Nun and 'Alien' veteran Sigourney Weaver as Queen Taya, neither of which get more than ten minutes of screen time sadly. Arguably the film's most bizarre aspect is the story's represent of God as a young lad played by Isaac Andrews. His performance is not necessarily bad, but his interaction with Christian Bale's Moses often plays out more awkward than riveting. In brief words, it is fairly questionable decision to leave viewers scratching their heads.Exodus: Gods and Kings is a sluggish biblical epic that may strive for a solid visual heft but lacks the emotional touch and compelling story to make it interesting. Though it is certainly far from claiming a spot for the worst religious-based picture, it is barely passable and almost instantly forgettable.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
69,Troy_Campbell,Enjoyable old-school romp.,7,5 December 2014,"Epic dramas like Exodus are becoming increasingly rare these days. Sweeping vistas, massive man-made period sets, larger than life characters, gigantic sword-and-sandal battles, grand- scale storytelling; all without a sense of irony or modern sensibility. The cineaste side of me thoroughly appreciated it, the everyday moviegoer side of me not quite as much. Whilst the visuals are resplendent (as is the norm with a Ridley Scott film) and the decade-spanning story is skillfully sculpted to fill a lengthy runtime, there is a spark missing. Alberto Iglesias produces a stimulating, if not memorable, score and DP Dariusz Wolski's top-notch cinematography is complemented with some clever CGI, making it hard to pinpoint why Exodus isn't mind-blowing. It certainly isn't the fault of the two leads, as Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton, as the internally tormented Moses and the power-hungry Ramses respectively, are amazing. Perhaps it's the criminally underused supporting cast, with Ben Kingsley, John Turturro and, most noticeably, Sigourney Weaver getting very little to do other than fill the poster with their commercially attractive names. Or maybe it is the method in which they portray God (no description here to avoid spoilers), which comes off as awkward and a tad contrived. Or it could be that it's middle act – centred on Moses' discovery of God and then the unleashing of the Ten Plagues – feels and looks extremely similar to 2014's other biblical yarn, Noah. Despite it lacking that special something to elevate it to brilliance, Exodus is an enjoyable old-school romp that is ripe for the big screen.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
70,RNMorton,But Why Oh Why?,5,12 December 2014,"Bale does a nice stoic rendering of the Moses personality. I thought Edgerton was a fascinating and powerful Pharaoh, consistent with the Biblical story. Valverde was a stunningly exotic Zipporah and played the limited role very effectively. Some of the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. The story ran pretty well without a lot of lags. So why do I give this just a five (a very very low rating for me)? Because they forgot about the actual Biblical story along the way. Why do they do that? I HAVE NO FLIPPING IDEA. With Peter Jackson I complained (somewhat mildly) about the plot deviations from Tolkien but here we are talking about the Word of God. Which they co-opted and then told in their own incorrect way. And it might look like some of the deviations are subtle and unimportant, but once you start changing the Word it can go places you didn't expect. And picturing God as a small child and having that child say things God never said is simply blasphemous. If you want to make stuff up, make it up for areas not covered by the Bible (what Pharaoh might have said to his wife), but don't contradict the Bible and absolutely don't make up stuff God said. Or just get away from our Bible, do a non-Biblical story and make up whatever you want.I almost left with my 9 year old (who was asleep) right before the plagues because the movie at that point was so irrelevant, but I hung in from then on to the bitter irrelevant end. What is the REAL irony here? They could have told the story straight out of the Bible and it would have played even better (besides, more importantly, being accurate). Instead they laid this trash on us. I have a lot more to say but I think that sums it up.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
71,brchthethird,"Handsomely mounted, but emotionally sterile",6,23 June 2015,"Ridley Scott could do epic films in his sleep, and his sense of scale in storytelling has few equals these days. However, EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS is definitely one of his lesser efforts. To begin with, it was a fool's errand to try and remake Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Secondly, a lot of choices he makes in the details of the story will not go over well with the a large part of the target audience. By now, the story of Moses leading the Hebrews out of Egypt is ubiquitous in literature and legend. Ask anyone and they'll probably be able to tell you part of it, if not the whole thing. So, the onus was on Ridley Scott to do something new and innovative to justify this new cinematic interpretation, and what the writers came up with is good and bad, in about equal measure. One major change which will certainly turn off Evangelicals is jettisoning the supernatural aspects of the story entirely, opting to ground it in history and reality as much as possible. So, the 10 Plagues and the parting of the Red Sea are straightforward natural disasters/occurrences. Then there's the portrayal of God as a petulant child, again, which will not sit well with the religious segment of the audience. Too bad for them that such a characterization is apt if you read the Old Testament thoroughly. What doesn't translate so well is the relationships among the central characters. I never quite bought the bond between Rameses and Moses, nor between Moses and his wife Zipporah. In general, the acting was fine given the talent involved, but none of them felt truly invested in the material, such that occasionally it came off more stagey/contrived than THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. The film also as a dreadfully slow pace and staggers from setpiece to setpiece with little or no emotional involvement or stakes beyond what is conjured up through some admittedly awesome visual effects. Ah, the visual effects. This is where the film comes out head and shoulders above its predecessors, and is really the only legitimate reason for seeing this. As stated before, Ridley Scott can do spectacle like no other and he doesn't disappoint here. There are a few well-staged battle sequences, and the 10 Plagues and crossing the Red Sea must have been jaw-dropping in theaters (I watched this on a Blu-ray). When all is said and done, the only reason I'm being so generous with the rating, or even really bothered buying it at all is because I'm a Ridley Scott fan and completist.

I am a movie critic. I do admire a good story, well directed and acted presented professionally in every aspect and will usually see a movie of these qualities as much as three times followed by the purchase of a blue-ray disc for my library. I am not getting that vibe here. I am suspecting that the Directors cut will be worth buying and viewing as it will have the entire filming and story line to help appreciate it.

In movie-making today, you really can't go too wrong unless you purposely do. There is absolutely no excuse for all these A players to turn out less that an outstanding film. I am hearing and sensing otherwise. Sadly, I will not be going to see this on the big screen. Rewarding unrewarding behavior just isn't right nor does it feel good. Amazing too if you consider all the negative write-ups coming in. It is not a conspiracy but a wake-up call. Guys, please earn the ten dollars I am paying to go to the movies or I won't go...I also have hope for the better...which puts it squarely in the hands of the players",Exodus - Gods and Kings
73,marcin_kukuczka,Warrior/Prophet Lacks Charisma,5,22 February 2015,"Ridley Scott once pointed out that part of the job he does is ""creating worlds."" He has proved that these 'worlds' of his may win the viewers leaving them dazzled and heighten the feeling of grandeur in a similar fashion as Hollywood pioneers used to do a few decades ago. With this in mind, I went to see EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS. And in spite of its first half, which is sort of visual journey into ancient Egypt, the film is rather a serious disappointment which lacks a charismatic protagonist and leaves a viewer constantly tormented by suggestion and indication. And not at all do I express this opinion as one of the Christian audience who ""distrust and dismiss the movie at the outset looking only for what it gets wrong"" (with reference to Brett McCracken's words). I am not going to enumerate the innumerable liberties taken with the biblical source but highlight certain important points.What strikes me most about this movie, and perhaps most of the viewers will agree with me, is the depiction of the protagonist, Moses, for many a key prophet of the Old Testament. Here I would not merely consider the portrayal by Christian Bale but the complex notion of this hero. With no reference to the predecessors on screen, including Theodore Roberts, the ultra famous Charlton Heston (whose characterization was inspired by Michelangelo's masterful sculpture) or Burt Lancaster, Bale's Moses lacks any continuity or charisma. Steven D.Greyfanus has concluded Scott/Bale's Moses most memorably as ""a skeptical humanist."" It is not only revealed in the modern approach to Biblical material but, primarily, in the 'almost' secular interpretation of the events. Everything, including his mission, appears to be at war within the character who is concerned with the solution and intellectually involved in it. Although he seems to undergo certain development, the stature of the leader is that of a warrior (his sword and never a rod), a revolutionist, an activist and, from a tempting but extremely modern and individual point of view, a man like any other man, a husband (here he comes and proves to his wife Sephora that he has brought his people) rather than a prophet supplied with the divine means. Here comes, naturally, the interpretation of God.Israel...the one who wrestles with God (not the one who fights with him)...this may display certain resemblance in Moses' acts but leads to greatest torments at the depiction of God in the film. The arguments in many reviews revolve around the notion whether the boy we find in the film is God of Israel, any 'god' or a divine messenger, a 'Malak.' The prelude tells us: the Hebrews have not forgotten their God for these 400 years and God has not forgotten them. What kind of God and His Image do we find in the boy? Many reviewers are intrigued by this concept. The boy is ""petulent in what he wants"" (Carl Kozlowski), manifests a ""daring move, perhaps, but also one that courts ridicule"" (Mark Kermode), he is ""a scowling boy with a curt manner and a temper"" (Greyfanus) - a postmodernist vision of a member of an interaction rather than a Creator. The liberties taken with the Biblical material appear to evoke most noticeably in the scenes of Moses' encounter with this boy.That is also manifested at the scenes of the plagues. Although we cannot skip the visual merit of these scenes, it is interesting to quote John Mulderig of Catholic News Service who points out: with ""computer-generated effects to spare, its human interaction is stilted and uninvolving."" So many scenes, more to say, the entire movie has too many general scenes, almost master scenes and, consequently, there is no room for the characters. We do not see particular characters of Hebrew slaves, we do not get the psychological burden that is put on men, women and children in captivity, we do not see the very real cry to God for help, for salvation. While the Pharaoh's court has some 'spicy' depiction, the slaves are totally neglected with few exceptions like Nun played by Ben Kingsley (but we purely see that the reason behind it is more give a chance of on screen time for an actor than any development of a character). As a result, ordinary viewers do not exactly get the point of the cause, why in fact 'this Moses' wants to set them free from Egypt and lead them to the land of Canaan.Here it is necessary to mention the two Pharaohs: Seti played by John Turturro and Rameses played by Joel Edgerton. While the former one does a pretty fine job echoing much of Sir Cedric Hardwicke's character (including the sympathy for Moses and disappointment with his son-successor), the latter one is a Pharaoh with little power and little appeal. Any remarkable depiction (if there is any) begins and ends with the scenes of the battle with the Hetites, then, Rameses goes more and more pale. Visual effects seem to take over and shadow his even more pathetic screen presence. To some extent, his character might bring to mind Commodus from GLADIATOR but the performances do not bear any resemblance.Nevertheless, I am not going to say that this film sums up as a total waste of time and money...EXODUS is a film which is worth seeing, anyway. Its first half seems to have very high expectations and seems to lead us to something ambitious, yet, from the moment of 'prophetic mission' it goes pale and offers a flawed storytelling. Perhaps Mr Scott does not feel at ease with Biblical content and, in his epics to come, he should consider warriors rather than prophets...5/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings
74,PartialMovieViewer,It's a Miracle...No...it Really Is. I Watched The Whole Thing,3,30 March 2015,"It's a miracle - compared to much of the fertilizer splattered across audience's eyeballs over the past few years - this pant-load wasn't completely putrid. I am no Biblical scholar so my criticism is far from faith-based. That being said, I did read Exodus once (another miracle). I never fully comprehended it though, so whatever I read went into my eyes and out of my ears and quickly splashed against my living-room floor. I obviously missed a lot of the miracle-meaning behind the story. Some old guy with a staff; a couple of stone tablets; the parting of the sea, and he did not get along with one of the Pharaohs. I know there is more to the story, I mean, come on, I did watch Charlton 'The Miracle' Heston couple of times. Anyways, when I was a kid, I think the Sunday Penguins rushed us through the 'Old Testament' so fast, using palaver gibberish to explain it's meaning, with an obvious intent to quickly finish the topic so the class could concentrate more on the 'New Testament'. Honestly, for me - to even realize there was an 'Old Testament' - is another of those miracles. So this critique has nothing to do with any of the flick's religious aspects...which is - yet - another miracle in itself. Christian Bale was his typical self. Interesting character acting void of depth, but miraculously fun to watch. Either you like the character he brings to the screen or you do not, I thought he was miraculously fine. I found Sigourney Weaver was in this movie - somewhere - but you really had to dig. She might have had two scenes with almost two lines to muddle through, a far cry from the 'Ripley' character - but still earned her a sarcophagus full of cash. Joel Edgerton and Ben Kingsley, for their parts, both did miraculously above mediocre jobs. Alas, even laden with all this huge talent, miraculously, CGI once again takes center stage. Unlike 'Gladiator', 'Exodus', surrendered center-stage to special effects, and that should not have happened. Sadly, and un-miraculously, this usually indicates the living, breathing actors are struggling with a substandard script. Regretfully, this was so true about this movie. 'Exodus' did seem to move along very well 'in the beginning', but fell apart pretty quickly. The story was fine, but the scripting was not polished - the writers needed their own miracle. In closing, the movie was not horrible...but far from great. I have seen it once...and I am good with one viewing. I may see if again though - miracles do happen",Exodus - Gods and Kings

76,Quietb-1,Some interesting takes on the Bible,6,12 December 2014,First you have to get past a guy named Christian playing Moses. The movie has some moments but it is unsatisfying. Ridley Scott has done much better. It starts with one of those battle scenes that you don't know who is fighting whom and why. A lot of time and money was spent to show Moses save his brother.The plagues are great. It is too long at 150 minutes. The film deserves a slew of technical nominations. There are spectacular visuals. Fifteen thousand people worked on the production. It deserves an award for creating jobs.The film plays well on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. The 3D didn't add much and it's a long time to sit in glasses.,Exodus - Gods and Kings
77,Anurag-Shetty,"Great special effects but, an average movie.",5,8 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings tells the story of Moses(Christian Bale). Moses rises up against the Egyptian pharaoh, Rhamses(Joel Edgerton). Moses & Rhamses used to be really close. Then, Moses gets fed up of Rhamses' cruel ways. Moses takes 600,000 slaves on a journey of escape from Egypt & its horrifying cycle of life threatening plagues. Exodus: Gods and Kings is an extremely dragging & mediocre film. The special effects & 3D are the only two highlights of the film. The effect of the plagues look even better in 3D. Apart from the special effects everything else in the movie is either bad or mediocre. The editing of the movie is particularly bad. The transition from one scene to the next happens at the most unexpected time. The film is generally dragging & doesn't start picking up till the second half. The weak script prevents the viewer from sympathizing with any of the characters. I can't believe such established actors would act in such a mediocre film. Christian Bale is impressive as Moses. Joel Edgerton is effective as Rhamses. Aaron Paul & Sigourney Weaver's talents are totally wasted in the pointless roles of Joshua & Tuya respectively. Maria Valverde is good as Sefora. Indira Varma is adequate as High Priestess. Ben Kingsley is great as Nun. Exodus: Gods and Kings is proof that great special effects & an all star cast don't necessarily make up a good movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Cinematography was great, visual effects as well, acting did not really go up to par with the rest of the film. Some different casting would of been better. I think this is a main weakness with of this film.I will recommend this film, especially if you like historical spectacles. This is a film for you.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
79,ersinkdotcom,"A soulless and humanistic attempt at rehashing ""The Ten Commandments""",4,20 March 2015,"I'm not entirely sure if Ridley Scott even read the story of Moses and the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt found in the Holy Bible before agreeing to climb behind the camera and direct ""Exodus: Gods and Kings."" Here we have an extremely fallible attempt at re- visiting what Cecil B. DeMille already perfected twice in two different decades with ""The Ten Commandments."" While those movies still took artistic freedoms, they were one hundred times more close to the source material than what we see here. In ""Exodus: Gods and Kings,"" Egyptian Princes Moses (Christian Bale) and Ramses (Joel Edgerton) are raised together as brothers. When Ramses becomes pharaoh, Moses is his most-trusted adviser. However Moses soon discovers his Hebrew parentage, and Ramses banishes him to the desert -- often a death sentence. But God has a mission for Moses: Free the Israelites from slavery. Moses returns from exile and demands that Ramses let his people go, but the arrogant ruler is unmoved, leading to a battle of divine wills.I can't believe it took four writers to completely desecrate and butcher what many would consider one of the most vital stories found in the Bible. Even if you consider the Holy Bible just to be another great piece of literature, ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is a terrible adaptation for the big-screen of what many believe is a cornerstone of their faith and some respect as great fantasy. If Ridley Scott were Chris Columbus, this is his ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" versus ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" as far as imprecise and exact book adaptations go, respectively. The acting in ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is all over the place in regards to performances. Christian Bale is completely wasted as Moses. He walks and stands around most of the film acting like a helpless bystander. Every once in a while he'll lead a revolt against the Egyptians, but for the most part he just observes God's spiteful punishment from afar. John Turturro plays the King of Egypt and does his very best in the dramatic role. However, the entire time I watched him on screen I kept waiting for him to exclaim, ""I'm very sneaky"" in a weird accent. Joel Edgerton's performance as the Pharaoh Ramses II shows he has the acting chops to take on better big-budget productions than this tripe. Sigourney Weaver floats through her fleeting appearances in the movie as if she's doing Ridley Scott a favor portraying the Queen of Egypt. I won't deny it was cool seeing the plagues come to life through the use of modern CGI. The alligators ravenously devouring the fisherman and turning the Nile red with their blood is a fun scene to watch. It was also an impressive sight to see all the frogs and locusts invading Egypt and wreaking havoc. The parting of the Red Sea was a bit of a visual disappointment, however. The primitive visual effects from 1956's ""The Ten Commandments"" were more stunning than what we got in ""Exodus: Gods and Kings.""""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is rated PG-13 for violence including battle sequences and intense images. There are some gory scenes of Egyptians being eaten by alligators and animals throwing up blood. We also see the lifeless bodies of Egyptian children as their parents cry in agony over their deaths, which will be disturbing to some. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" completely belittles its reluctant hero and makes him nothing more than a raving mad bystander instead of the obedient instrument of God's just rule. On top of that, the once powerful God is whittled down to a spoiled child who is arrogant and prone to venomous temper tantrums. The supernatural plagues found in the scriptures are reduced to natural disasters for the most part, easily explained away by convenient scientific theory. When it's all said and done, the entire production is nothing more than a soulless and humanistic attempt at rehashing Cecil B. DeMille's original masterpiece ""The Ten Commandments.""",Exodus - Gods and Kings
80,Likes_Ninjas90,A grandly staged but soulless and mediocre retelling of Moses liberating the slaves of Egypt,4,6 December 2014,"Ridley Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings is a grandly staged but soulless and mediocre retelling of Moses liberating the slaves of Egypt. It is one of two Bible films released in 2014, following Darren Aronofsky's Noah, which envisioned a corrupt world cleansed of evil by a violent God and where a single man was enlisted to salvage a group of people. This description is applicable to Exodus given the over familiarity of its plotting and characters. The return of these Biblical epics is not only because Hollywood is heavily influenced by Christian values and religious groups in the industry. The popularisation of epics in the vein of Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments and William Wyler's Ben Hur is also political. Currently, violence and extremism are perpetuated by radical fundamentalists misinterpreting religion. Bible stories are as current as they are ancient, relaying the Old Testament's brutality and reflecting perpetually violent attitudes of modern extremists.While Aronofsky's film gambled on bleak, moody stylisation, Exodus' treatment is safe and unsurprising, adhering to a fault to past filmmaking traditions. Prior to the film's release, an online boycott was launched, attacking the decision to cast White actors in major roles of Middle Eastern characters. White imitation, where Anglo- Saxon actors impersonate ethnic roles, is an unproud, archaic Hollywood practice. Ridley Scott defended the casting in a Variety interview: ""I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such."" His insensitivity doesn't account for how White actors today would be forbidden from playing a Black character, particularly in America. Similarly, given Hollywood's oversaturated marketing budgets, would it be too difficult to sell the film on Scott's name alone or introduce new actors to the world?Casting recognisable stars detracts sharply from the film's period rendering. Featuring Englishmen Christian Bale and Ben Kingsley, Americans Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro and Aaron Paul and Australians Ben Mendelsohn and Joel Edgerton, there's a wave of familiar faces and accents jarring with the setting and typifying the film's homogenisation. Rarely does an image, a line of dialogue, or character feel unique to the film either. The opening quarter particularly mimics Scott's Gladiator too closely. Moses (Bale) is a more skillful warrior and tactician than his half brother Ramses (Edgerton). He saves Ramses life in an early battle scene and Ramses' father Seti (John Turturro) seems to favour him more even though he is adopted and unlikely to become the next Pharaoh. After investigating the thieving shonky practices of Hegep (Mendelsohn), Moses's true Hebrew heritage is explained to him by Nun (Ben Kingsley). Hegep reveals this to Ramses, who forces Moses into exile. Moses starts a family of his own in a village, with a wife and son. After hitting his head he is plagued by visions of God inhabiting the body of a young boy (Isaac Andrews), who encourages him to free the Hebrews from enslavement. His fate of being exiled, his goal and motives are highly similar to Maximus.Bale's inclusion accentuates the derivativeness of the archetype. Instead of a cape and a mask, Moses wields a gold sword. But like Bruce Wayne, Moses's arc is typical of Hollywood characters searching for individualism. He predictably transitions from denying his legacy to liberating his people and reuniting himself with his family. The script rewritten by Steve Zaillian from Bill Collage and Adam Cooper's drafts takes Moses through unnecessary detours. Ramses only considers killing Moses long after he's exiled and a training montage where Moses teaches soldiers to fight is wasted when God unleashes the plagues instead. Moses becomes displaced from the story, except for a tangent where he disapproves of God's methods of justice. The plagues of Egypt are admittedly disturbing and visceral, but the literal interpretation diminishes possibilities of Moses imagining God. One unsettling dramatic touch is cutting to Ramses' family life before the plagues, which builds tension knowing his son's fate. But Ramses isn't a juicy villain but a weak symbol of hubris. Joel Edgerton doesn't have a firm grasp on what angle to take, meaning we don't entirely feel the emotion of his blindness and rage.Once Exodus escapes its stifled first half, the rest of narrative from the plagues onwards is overly familiar, bloody and brutal and supplies the actors with predictable, punchline dialogue spoken in plain English. There was a chance here to touch upon refugees escaping war and enslavement. These are issues dramatised only through the rhythms of action set pieces. While Scott's Robin Hood cut a new origin story into an old tale and reinvented the characters, there are fewer surprises about how this film develops because of how risk-averse it is with the narrative and the casting. While the scale of the film is huge and cinematic, it's the finer attention to detail in the screenplay and the period which feel lacking. Imagination and distinction are not qualities one would expect missing from the director who made Alien and Blade Runner. But in his twilight year Ridley Scott is determined largely to make epics of numbers rather than people.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
81,Laakbaar,"Rich, evocative and moving portrayal of the Exodus story",9,25 December 2014,"This epic movie succeeds spectacularly at retelling the Exodus story. It's hard to find fault with any of it. I particularly enjoyed Scott's grand vision of ancient Egypt and Egyptian society. I've been to Egypt several times, so it was interesting to see the ruins and people come to life. The all-too-familiar scenes (the plagues, the messages from God and the parting of the Red Sea) were all done particularly well, I thought. The casting, acting, dialogue and writing worked perfectly for me, with the exception of one or two lines. The story came to life for me. I was deeply moved at times. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it is an excellent movie, one with a theme that resonates deeply in Western culture.I see from the voting patterns that this is one of those polarising movies that get a lot of 1s and a lot of 10s. I also see that people give it an average of around 7, reciting a long list of various grievances many of which do not relate to the movie itself. I can't be bothered to read the reviews to get into the politics and cultural issues behind this review scoring.All I can say is that the two of us thought it was an excellent movie and you'd be crazy to miss it. Movie-making at its best.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
82,nicholls_les,One of the worst accounts of a great story,1,27 June 2016,"It is hard to know where to begin, but this movie is a travesty.First it does not keep to the Biblical account at all and makes Moses look like a demented idiot who has no idea what he is trying to do.The Movie started out quite promisingly but it deteriorated very quickly. Moses knew he was an Isrealite as he had been partly raised by his Mother and sister who told him who he was, this was not shown at all/ He killed an Egyptian who was mistreating an Israelite and this led to his exile to Midian for 40 years (but in this film Moses rarely ages)But he very worse part of the entire film was that God is depicted as an unruly child with a speech impediment. According to the Bible, Moses heard God's voice from a burning bush, he was not stricken by rocks and laying under a mud slide as the film depicts.As for the Ten Plagues! Each one of the plagues was an insult to an Egyptian God and Moses and Aaron (Aaron was the one who spoke according to the Bible but is not even featured in the film as more than a bit player) gave the Pharoah an opportunity to release the Jews before each one. But in this film Moses himself seems unsure what God is doing and the scenes of Lambs blood over the doors etc, he says, 'If I am wrong about this', as if it was his idea or he was trying to guess what God was doing. The Bible clearly states that God instructed Moses exactly what was going to happen.Then the scene at the Red Sea, where was the pillar of smoke by day and fire by night? And the Bible says that the Isrealites walked through the Red sea on 'dry' land, not waist deep in a low tide.I would suggest Mr Scott stick to making films about aliens or gladiators and avoid trying to re-write the Bible.As for the casting, how wrong could it be? Christian Bale has zero presence, Joel Edgerton is a weak confused Pharoah and the rest are not much better. Ben Kingsley would have made a better Pharoah and his character of Nun was a non event. Although María Valverde was very good as Zipporah, the Bible mentions that Zipporah was a dark skinned Midianitess, not Latin American.So if you enjoy Biblical epics avoid this like it was an eleventh plague.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
83,SquigglyCrunch,Enjoyable but still bad,5,1 May 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings was an entertaining movie at best. I enjoyed watching the fighting scenes and the plagues were a lot more fun to watch than I thought they'd be. However, as a Christian who loves the story of Moses, I found little in this movie. Ridley Scott poorly adapted this Bible story into a movie. It felt more like a re-imagining than an adaptation. I understand what Scott was trying to do, but that doesn't mean that he should have done it, nor that it was done right. God is portrayed very incorrectly, and so is Moses. I feel like if Scott had bothered to read more of the Bible that he would have better understood what kind of god God is, and therefore would have been able to better portray him. However, other than the length, as a movie it was pretty good. If I had never read the story or wasn't a Christian, I think I would have liked this movie more. But as part of the targeted audience (which is Christians) I found it hard to like.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

85,TheSquiss,Biblical epic that defies belief & looses the plot. Better than Noah. Marginally.,2,5 January 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings was a perfectly apt film to finish the year with, coming as it did at Christmas; you know, that time of year loosely based around a biblical story that has been messed around with, diluted, corrupted and made to fit the limited understanding and excessive desires of the masses. And so it is with Ridley Scott's latest epic.For those who have never opened a bible, read the book of Exodus or heard the story of Moses, fear not; Ridley Scott has made Exodus: Gods and Kings just for you. Starting slowly, just so that you keep up, he introduces us to Moses (Christian Bale), adopted brother of Ramses (Joel Edgerton), shows how close they are, highlights the jealousy from Ramses and sets in motion the evil actions that lead to Moses struggling to free 600,000 slaved Israelites armed with God and his/her/its various plagues.If you have even the vaguest understanding of the 'true' story, as depicted in the bible, or even a passing knowledge of the generally accepted history of the time, step away. To say it is anachronistic is to claim the Titanic took on some water. God, if he has a celestial screening room, is either preparing a Hollywood-bound bolt of lightning or giggling hysterically. Exodus: Gods and Kings is better than Darren Aronofsky's Noah, but only marginally.Forget any hint of the miraculous for a start. All those miracles (the plagues, the serpent and staff, the gift of the ten commandments) you've heard of? Nope. All either absent or explained by visions, delusions and science. Oh, except for the final plague. Hmm, I guess Scott ran out of ideas and logic for that one. So lost is the director that he doesn't even explain what the final plague is until it occurs (despite his source material sating Moses spelt it out in advance) just so that you, oh unenlightened viewer, can revel in the surprise. Oh boy.Moses, meanwhile, has his own mental health issues visualizing God not as an omnipotent entity in a burning bush or a tower of flame but a petulant child with the acting ability of a recently slaughtered goat. He also seems unsure who or what is causing the plagues, at first threatening the Pharaoh with yet more unless he frees the slaves and later claiming he has no control or influence over them. With the final plague, he virtually shrugs his shoulders and says ""Nothing to do with me, mate. Even I think God has ballsed this one up."" Oh, the pain.Scott has become known as a director who matches his huge success with some terrible clunks. Surely we're due at least one phenomenal film soon. Please? Why, when the man is capable of creating original yarns that thrill and excite decades after release (Blade Runner, Alien), has he chosen to take a story familiar and loved by millions more than will ever watch his films, and trash it with his own invention? I like Scott. I'm one of the few who 'got' Prometheus, one of the fewer still who paid to see Matchstick Men. Furthermore, I'm not a paid up member of any church, but even I can see what a mess he's made of Exodus: Gods and Kings.What begins as an arduous plod quickly becomes a rush as the plagues are whizzed through and the forty-year trek to Canaan (Yes, I know you and I could probably crawl it in six months) flits by. Characters are lost with barely a look down the lens; Sigourney Weaver and Aaron Paul might just as well have been played by mannequins for all the attention they are given.And let's not delve to deeply with the laughable melting pot of accents on display within the same tribes and families. At least in Scott's Robin Hood the ludicrous variation in accents came, largely, out of just Russell Crowe's mouth.So why two stars instead of just one? For two reasons: 1. Some of the sets and CGI are beautiful, though lacking in depth and scale to make Exodus: Gods and Kings truly an epic; and 2. Because Noah was worse.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Granted, Ridley Scott showcased some awesome visuals, I though the special effects were incredible, and the cast was filled with talented people. However, a lot of the cast didn't feel right for the roles—beyond the fact that this film is clearly ""white-washed""—and the whole story just felt like it was going through the motions and wasn't bothering to put the effort in.

87,davidgee,The face of God (at summer camp),6,30 December 2014,"The Old Testament gets a makeover in this Ridley Scott revised version of Cecil B. De Mille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS which also borrows from Scott's own GLADIATOR and BEN HUR (which GLADIATOR richly pillaged). If that sounds like a mishmash, it's because this movie is a mishmash.The story of Moses in the bull-rushes is skipped, so it's never quite made clear why Pharoah Seti (John Turturro in high camp mode) has reared Moses (Christian Bale, mostly looking rather bedraggled) as a brother to Ramses (Joel Edgerton, mostly looking like a baseball player). Anyway, the two fall out after Seti's death and Moses does a few years in the wilderness before returning to Egypt to lead his people in the direction of the Promised Land. Moses's people are called 'the Hebrews': the Biblical name for them, the Israelites, is studiously avoided: ho hum. As the poster makes plain, the movie's big moment is going to be the parting of the Red Sea, although this is a slightly low-key climax in CGI terms. The plagues that God visits on the Egyptians are a lot more vivid, especially in 3D.In THE TEN COMMANDMENTS God was an American-accented voice who ""spake"" to Charlton Heston and punched out the actual commandments with bolts of fire. In EXODUS we get to look on the very face of God, but since He is portrayed as a young boy at summer camp, holiness and the wow factor are conspicuously lacking. Bale has to chisel the commandments out for himself. I also felt slightly chiselled.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

However the casting is bad and Bale and Edgerton are completely wrong in their parts. As expected it is visually arresting but that is not enough to carry the viewer along. I am about a third of the way through the film as I write this and the fact that I am writing as I watch shows how uninvolved in the film I am. Special effects are terrific but they are no substitute for good storytelling - the script is too modernistic and so it loses authenticity, the actors are mostly merely saying their lines with no meaning behind them. The Cecil B. De Mille movie had a real majesty about it and although Heston was never the greatest actor he carried his role and was Moses. Likewise Yul Brynner inhabited the part as Pharoah Rameses.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
89,bbickley13-921-58664,At least black actors will not be blamed for the flaws of this movie.,6,14 December 2014,"I could talk about how politically incorrect it was for a huge director like Scott to not use his power to demand that the movie be more ""historically Accurate"" to where the events took place, but to be honest, this movie was so lackluster, that I would not want the edition of more black and Brown actors (not playing bad guys and slaves anyway) to be the a reason behind why it was so average.It's no Gladiator, though Christian Bale did play a great Mosses, in comparison to Russel Crowe's Maxim or his go as Noah. Or even to compare him to Charlton Heston in the Ten Commandments. I'm guessing Bale put on the weight to look more like they would have back in the day, but what really caught me was his portrayal of Moses as a man who is truly having a conversation with God, and not just worshiping him blindly. I really liked thatJoel Edgerton is no Yul Bryner, but no one is, so it would be unfair to dwell on that.It did come to a delightful surprise to see John Turturro in the film as Seti, but having him there as well as Sigourney Weaver in a small role, proves the point everyone is trying to make.The real problem with the movie is that it's very emotionally distant, as it just went by the numbers to tell the story with out giving it much passion, so no matter how good the white actors were in this pic, it all went by too fast to truly notice.The action sequences were amazing of course. Ridley is a visual master so that does not surprise me.If this is all Scott had to offer, once again I'm glad he bowed down to the studio who told him black actors don't sell. Cause then they would have been blamed for his like of Depth.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

All-in-all it is a very pleasant film to watch and follow, but it is dragged down by the story, you can't really change it that much, so it suffers from what other Biblical movies does, it isn't really about the story, because we know that one and in many cases it is actually not an interesting one.You can see it for the good acting, for the extensive differences, the beautiful grand sceneries and that will be it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
91,PyroSikTh,A more grounded look at a timeless tale,8,29 December 2014,"It's a story we all know, religious or not. Moses freed the Hebrew slaves from their Egyptian overlords after a series of plagues, crossed the red sea, and carved some rules into some rocks. Literally nothing of that core foundation has changed. Moses still frees the Hebrew slaves, there are still a series of biblical plagues, they still cross the red sea, and there remains rocks with words carved into them. What makes this adaptation a little different are the details. It's a grounded interpretation. There's still the presence of gods, obviously, but the plagues for instance aren't a set of ten unrelated plagues. It's one plague that produces another that produces another; the red rivers kill the waterlife, the frogs escape and overrun the city, they die and produce flies, the flies bring diseases that manifest as boils, which then transfer to the cattle and livestock. All right, there's also the locusts, hailstorm, and death of the first-borns by an ominous shadow that don't fit in, but it altogether makes the events a little more believable. This is how God would act. There would be no pillar of flame or pointing finger from the sky, just natural events that can be reasoned with science. It can be argued that this is how he still acts to this day (unless you've seen any pointing fingers from the sky, of course?).Another big difference that sets this version apart, and perhaps the most crucial, is it's treatment of it's characters. The most affected by this direction is Rameses. No longer is he the cruel, evil dictator, hated by all. Well all right he's not a saint, and he doesn't prove particularly popular or competent. However he is shown in a bit more a sympathetic light. It reaches it's most apparent with the deaths of the first-borns. It's a harrowing watch, more harrowing than I've ever seen it, and I'm convinced it's not just because I'm now a father myself. The shot of a distraught Rameses holding a limp, pale baby in his arms is heart-wrenching. He's not a nice guy, but he didn't deserve that. Neither did his wife as she sits on the floor rocking an empty cot. It all comes to a head when he confront Moses to tell them to leave, asking ""Is this the kind of god you worship? A murderer of children?"" It doesn't paint the Christian deity in much of a good light either, but that's the God of the Old Testament; vengeful and angry.If I had one complaint with how the story was adjusted, it would be the plagues. The chain-link of them is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but I often found myself wondering if the acts of god were a bit too over-the-top. The example that springs to mind is the river of blood. It's actual blood from a handful of guys on a boat being ripped to shreds by a swarm of crocodiles. It's dramatic and thrilling to watch, but there are much more believable routes to be taken, such as that of the red tide in Iraq, where the waters are full of an overabundance of red algae that cause a toxic environment in the water and kill all the fish. It would've had much the same effect, albeit have been much less thrilling and not as easy to explain.It all looks great though. The CGI use is at it's absolute strongest, lending some of the most detailed and crisp renderings I've seen on film. The manipulation of the clouds to make some epic skylines always looks great, but it's the panoramas of crowds of people that really show off the attention to detail on display. It's as if every person is rendered fully, individually. Whether it's overlooking a mile-wide quarry, or watching chariots cascade down a crumbling cliff-edge, everything is just so clear and detailed.Acting is on the nose as well. Christian Bale manages to make the most compelling Moses yet. Much like Russell Crowe in Noah, this hero is not an infallible saint who follows blindly and knows all the answers. He's a human being like the rest of us. He's confused and lost and doesn't really know what he's doing, and when God intervenes with something he disagrees with, he doesn't just politely bend the knee. Joel Edgerton's Rameses is much the same, and the chemistry he shares with Bale absolutely forges the brotherly bond we're watching develop (or unravel). The rest of the cast list is impressive, but I can't say they're all put to good use. Shout out to Isaac Andrews who plays the child embodiment of Malak (God) though. His performance was spectacular, particularly when he manages to bring about the angry, vengeful side of God to perfection. Watch out for this kid, he's going places. He almost put Christian Bale to shame, just on that one scene alone.Like every religious movie (apart from Passion of course), Exodus will meet it's fair share of closed-minded Christians who decry it for not perfectly adapting every detail of the bible, or non-Christians who have no interest in having the concept of God shoved down their throats (it's a biblical story, what do you expect?). From this unbiased viewpoint who is not religious, but has read the book of Exodus, this is probably my favourite adaptation. It makes strides in trying to be a more realistic look at what is an otherwise tale of fantasy. It's a look at brothers, a look at freedom, a look at vengeance and desperation. It becomes even more poignant when the credits come up at the end with ""Dedicated to my brother; Tony Scott"". It's a fitting tribute from one brother to another. I award this a thoroughly enjoyable 8/10.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
92,CinematicInceptions,Looking to provoke thought rather than enjoyment.,7,3 November 2015,"I admire the work that went into this movie in the sense that the filmmakers, primarily the writers, likely knew that people wouldn't like the final product. By getting past this, they were able to make a thought provoking story out of something that you would expect to be rather religiously conformist. I had issues with it as I know everyone else did with deviations from the bible and what we generally expected the movie to be. But honestly, we've heard the biblical version of the story before and it's already been made into a movie, so to make it the same as the others would be sort of pointless. I think that it was a deceptively good call to advertise this in a way that would make Judeo-Christians and the people who go to see religious movies want to see it, and then spin the actual themes around on them. Again, it probably didn't make a lot of people happy, but I'd be surprised if it didn't make them think a little. They certainly weren't trying to convert atheist viewers, because it would be almost impossible to follow the story without knowing how the events of Exodus line up. The overall story would make sense to non-religious viewers, but certain scenes like Nun's revelation that Moses is a Hebrew and the resulting encounter between Moses and Ramses would be very confusing.The events are the same as we know them with Moses leading the Hebrews out of slavery and God sending the plagues. However, in this case, we get a closer look into the character of Moses, which is something we haven't really seen before. For everything it might be able to do, the bible is not the place to go for complex and well-written characters. We can see that he is a righteous man as general of Egypt and has an aversion to the whole idea of prophetic signs and higher beings. His conversion takes time and is not really complete even at the end. In fact, Ridly Scott and Co. seem to want us to question God's actions quite as much as Moses' reaction to them. I think there is a lot of value in this, exemplified by Moses and Zipporah's (his wife) exchange about whether their son should believe in God or himself. I think that is the basic point of the movie, or at least it's what I took from it: you need both faith in yourself and in some higher power. Both have their limitations and so are unreliable on their own, but the key is to blend them. Granted, most of his argument's with God stem from the Egyptians' treatment of the Hebrews versus God's treatment of the the Egyptians. There is also the added factor of Moses' feelings for Ramses, which brought his pleas to release the Hebrews to a new level that felt a little more believable. Similarly, the plagues were made to seem a little more plausible, both in their initiation and their progression. It would make sense that God would only use the medium of plagues to achieve his end after using Moses did not work. Several of the plagues themselves stemmed from one another too.In terms of execution, it turned out nicely. There were a lot of very vast settings with similarly expansive numbers of people to fill them. The plagues and other natural miracles were obviously CGI, but good CGI at that. The images didn't look realistic, but they did look clean and sharp. Christian Bale did a great job acting, and the other actors contributed decent performances as well, though people might get annoyed by the kid who plays God (perhaps that's making a point). I liked the script for the most part, though some of Ramses' lines felt a little inconsistent with his character. The story follows basically the same progression as Gladiator and Robin Hood, which is likely why Scott directed it. He seems to have a thing for outcast military commanders, incompetent princes replacing dead monarchs, old-fashioned warfare, and hints at spirituality in his movies (though it's a bit more than a hint here). He did a good job directing, and you can see some of the same camera-work in the opening battle sequence as we've seen in his other works. I would recommend that pretty much everyone who knows the story of Exodus to watch this, but make sure you release whatever expectations you have. Don't expect to like it because you most likely won't, but have an open mind. Don't take the trailer too seriously either. Even though much of it depicts battle sequences, there is really only one of these at the very beginning. So in a nutshell, you have to decide for yourself what to take out of this film. Overall Rating: 7.7/10.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
93,MattBrady099,Ridley Scott why?,5,21 December 2014,"Oh Ridley Scott why?. Why do you always keep doing this. I know you're a great director, you proved that back in your gold age of films, but now you make such forgettable and mostly terrible films like: Hannibal, Robin Hood, The Counselor and now this.The story is about a Moses as he rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues. Judging by the trailers of this film I was pretty excited for the movie, because it looks exciting, epic and looks like a lot of fun. Until I sawed the reviews for the film and on RT it had 2.8% and on Metacritic it had about 5.2% and let me just I was really disappointed from hearing that, I thought Ridley Scott finally got his mo Jo back but really he hasn't. RANT Time: Once I sawed a article about people complain about the none Egyptian actors playing famous Egyptian as known today, and the director himself has come out and said that he can't work with actors from different county's like Egyptian, because it's to hard work and he doesn't get a long with them. Hearing that I give up on Ridley on this, you can't work with people that are from different country's? I'm sorry but are you not the man who bough us Alien, Gladiator and Blade Runner. Dude your know has the master of directing and you can't work with people from different country's because ""It's to hard work"", well judging on Alien and Blade Runner which looked really hard to do and probably took a long time to finish. That's easy to you but you don't want to work with people from different country's, F**K you Ridley, but I still love you other movies. Anywhere I still kept a open mind going into this movie, even with the news like that which really bothered me but still maybe the actors might pull it off, and let me just say after viewing the film it's not as bad as the critics are describing it to be, but it's really disappointing.Christian Bale did okay as Moses as Mr. Bale can nail every role his in, but this one is may not incredible but he didn't do a bad job. Joel Edgerton did okay as well. That might sound really uninspiring and not very creative words to use for these two performance, but as I said their performances wasn't incredible or anything special, so yeah I'm sticking to it's okay. The visual effect's were pretty good and the red sea part I have to say was pretty well done. The directing by Ridley once again was pretty damn good, even when I'm not that happy with him for making such a poor decision, he still mangers to win me over. Now for the big problems: The story of Moses and the red sea had to be the most interesting and the most imaginative story I've ever seen, but in this movie it gets over shadowed by the action scenes and to don't get me wrong the action sense were pretty bad-ass, but don't forget you're telling a classic story of Moses. Sigourney Weaver was wasted in this movie and that's just sad to see that, has she is a freaking damn great actress being in roles that just put her talent to waste. Aaron Paul as well was wasted in this movie just like Weaver. Exodus: Gods and Kings has to be the most blandest and the most disappointing movie of this year and I really wanted this movie to be good, but it just turned out to be a disappointment from a director who use to have his spot light.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

95,Al_The_Strange,Exodus: Gods and Kings Review,7,20 December 2014,"For thousands of years, the Book of Exodus has stood as a awe-inspiring account showing how Moses, united with God's power, liberated the Jews from slavery, and set them on the path to form their own nation. It's always been an inspiring tale of faith, power, and liberation. Plus, the characters have always been compelling archetypes; Moses, much like Maximus in Gladiator, is a man who serves his country, is banished, but comes back with a vengeance. Ramesses, much like Commodus in Gladiator, is a man whose ego is so bloated, he is driven to betray his most loyal followers. Put the two together, and you have a dynamic, intense character-driven conflict, which touches on timeless themes of loyalty, the nature of power, and the nature of faith.Exodus: Gods and Kings promises an epic, visually-lush retelling of these classic characters and events. It bears something in common with Ridley Scott's earlier work with Gladiator, especially in regards to the characters. However, as it is with Kingdom of Heaven's theatrical cut and 2010's Robin Hood, the experience of Exodus is not always perfect.The film definitely delivers on the visual front: each scene is laden with beautiful landscapes, highly-detailed sets and props, and lavish visual effects. There is one major battle scene in the beginning, which is fairly satisfying. After a long stretch of slower-paced drama, the ten plagues are shown as a montage of widespread chaos. It's portrayed less as a direct action of God, and more as a chain reaction of nature, with God's oversight; some audiences won't like this depiction, but I personally loved it. The passover scene is appropriately somber. When the exodus finally happens, the famous Red Sea scene offers a fantastic vision of a giant wall of water crashing over the Egyptian army, and it is quite the impressive sight.Unfortunately, in-between all these exciting scenes, the film slows down drastically to a crawl, wadding through character-driven drama. It makes the pacing really herky-jerky, and if you don't care for the lead characters, then the film will be a total bore.As it is, I found the characters to be decent enough. I could appreciate the conflict between Moses and Ramesses, which has a lot of push and pull that keeps the plot moving through its projected course. What might make the story iffy, however, is the details and how they compare to the source material. Moses is presented as a man who ""wrestles with God,"" rather than simply doing God's bidding or wielding God's power. God appears as a character, and it's not even clear if He's meant to be taken literally or as a figment of Moses' imagination. God's goal throughout is to upstage everybody else, to humble them. It's in line with the Old Testament view of things, but on-screen, it feels off, because God's relationship with Moses is purposefully strained. Bible literalists will find this movie distasteful, thanks to the unconventional way the characters and events are handled.Fortunately, the film looks splendid, with fantastic photography and editing. Acting is great: I thoroughly appreciated Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton as the two leads, I loved Maria Valverde, and everybody else is not bad. Writing is pretty bad; most dialogue is blunt, unrefined, and it feels oddly modernized. This production uses spectacular sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The music score is really beautiful too.Despite the quality of the production, the quality performances, and the visual grandeur, the film has messy pacing and messy content that won't sit well with most viewers. I personally feel that the film has merit, and deviations from the Bible don't bother me that much, but it does feel a little off, and I'd love to see if a director's cut will rectify these problems the way it did with Kingdom of Heaven. As it is, anybody looking for a straight biblical adaptation should stick with Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. Rent this only if you're a fan of historical epics, and you're not too hung up over biblical accuracy.3.5/5 (Experience: Average | Content: Marginal | Film: Very Good)",Exodus - Gods and Kings
96,Offworld_Colony,"With nowhere near the auditory or visual pop and splendour of Kingdom of Heaven,",5,14 February 2020,"With no lessons learned from the much better paced Directors Cut of that film and with none of that film's current social relevance, Scott's Exodus is not as well written as Gladiator and relies on its star power instead of its character development. And while Bale is excellent, and whitewashing is a complicated issue that I won't touch, the moments brown-face does go a little too far. Was there ever any legs in the idea of a gritty realistic Moses story? I don't know. But what I do know is absolutely every ounce of Scott's magic is absent in this film, save for a few decently constructed scenes and the requisite good design.

From acclaimed director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Prometheus) comes the epic adventure ""Exodus: Gods and Kings,"" the story of one man's daring courage to take on the might of an empire.

98,p-jonsson,Unimpressive rewrite of a good adventure story,5,25 July 2015,"This movie was rather disappointing as far as I am concerned. The original story has been rewritten rather drastically. This in itself do not bother me too much. I am not one of those fanatics that get a fart stuck the wrong way if someone messes with the holy bible. However, I really do not think this was a good rewrite. A lot of the magical moments had been removed and that took away a lot from the story.The movie starts off good enough with some nice and fairly impressive battles. Then it slows down a lot and sometimes I got a ""get on with it damn it"" feeling. When we finally got around to the burning bush part I got rather underwhelmed. God as a vengeful kid? Come on! The disasters and the special effects are not too shabby but the entire bit where Moses confronted Ramses and warned him about the disasters that where to befall Egypt are taken out. They where just thrown on Egypt one after another in ways that could be explained away as natural disasters. From one point of view I can understand the wish to do this but to me it took something away from the movie.Later when Ramses decides to go after the Hebrews it continues in the same way with Ridley Scott downplaying the magic in the story. There is no pillar of fire and Moses is not holding out his staff to split the see. The sea just decided to recede and Moses takes advantage of it. Sure the effects when the water returns where quite cool but again, the magic was gone.Technically the movie is quite well done and the acting is quite okay but the biblical grandeur and mythical aspects are no longer there. This grand adventure story is simply reduced to an ordinary, fairly mediocre adventure movie with a high budget. I have to say that I enjoyed Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments more even though the special effects in that one is hopelessly outdated and the acting is a bit awkward.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

It's not a masterpiece, but it's a very decent movie, which keeps you interested in the story.The movie is a bit too long but it has some good visuals and I like the approach of (partially) trying to explain some the events in a rational way (but they don't do that fully and they also feed you that with a spoon).Most of the characters has no development. Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver are completely wasted in this movie.Some good bits of score by Alberto Iglesias.All in all, it's an OK movie, especially for children.

100,scottshak_111,"Insipid, bland and weak.",6,18 December 2014,"We all know the Moses story, right? Now take that and start abruptly with a war no one cares for, a prophecy that isn't theatrical and the crucial intricate past that gets narrated via the lips of Ben Kingsley. Disaster huh? Okay, so Exodus: Gods and Kings was quite next to it. The fact that Ridley was making this epic saga into a movie was a big adrenaline rush per se. So we naturally turned up with mighty expectations.The tale starts out of the blue from a mere conversation about Hittite wars and a prophecy that comes from Seti entailing a man saving another who would become the leader. But unfortunately the movie lacks focus. Where story building was important it lacks focus as we jump on to different frames without a proper closure. Heading towards the interval only let out a lot of gasps and yawns.However, there are some crucial elements in Ridley's direction that simply cannot be shaken off: Plagues that plagued Egypt were subtly shown. We find a guy who endeavours to reason everything happening with a logical explanation. Scott as an atheist does try his best to manifest Malak, the messenger of God, subtly after a blow on Moses's head knocks him out. A couple of shots of Joshua sneaking in to find Moses talking to nobody, depicts that Malak could only be a figment in his head and that everything happened without a Godly venture. The practicality of the low tides, the sea drying out and cyclones seemed to usher in a new age thinking that Ridley perfected. Yet, there was a subconscious Hebrew-helper that seemed to work in Moses's favor all the time. Bits of the eventuality of the flick were great to watch. The ending wraps up with 'For my brother Tony' that takes you some years back to the unfortunate death of Tony Scott. It was a warm gesture. And Respect! Even though the visuals were great, most of the movie ran dark. Aaron Paul is simply there. A mere observer. He has the most limited lines and gawks at Moses madness for hours. Falling for Zipporah is sour. It lacked drama. Edgerton being a great actor ends up moderating perversion. Bale looks great as Moses but doesn't impress much.There are so many minute details in the Exodus story that has simply gone unnoticed owing to the compact tale Scott wove. My advice: Make it a TV Series instead and justice shall be done! Haven't watched The Ten Commandments but from what I gather it was still better. From my recommend-box, if you want to watch a good Exodus story, just watch the animated flick 'The Prince of Egypt'. Way better than this one!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
101,OttoVonB,Subtle Brilliance or Fatal Indecisiveness?,8,4 May 2015,"Ridley Scott seems to be on an odd roll, one that perhaps has been foreshadowed by the rest of his career for some time: ideas have now come before structure. This is the root of why people seem to be very conflicted about Prometheus, The Counsilor and now Exodus, and while the later is by far the better film, its religious component makes it an obvious magnet for controversy.But forget about theology, how does it measure up as a film, as entertainment and art? Easy question, difficult answer. Bale does an unexpectedly tender and likable Moses, and the always-dependable Edgerton might well be the best Ramses I've seen so far. For all the epicness unleashed at times and implied by the advertising, it is a very intimate film, much more-so than any version of this tale we've seen to date, and that is a good thing. It is beautiful to behold, but in a way that screams of a seasoned hand at the tiller, mostly absent self-conscious pyrotechnics. The presentation of the plagues and more supernatural occurrences allows you to believe, but also strongly doubt, and are perhaps all the more terrifying for it. On paper this has all the makings of a stellar masterpiece, but... what happened during editing? At 144 minutes, the film manages to feel both overlong at times and too short, and we can safely assume that an earlier 4 hour cut has something to do with this. This is most keenly felt in the film's first half-hour, where Moses (Bale)'s relationship with adoptive parents Seti (Turturo) and Tuya (Weaver) is hinted at but very rushed, as are these two fine actors' screen times, proportionally to their billing, another sign of problems in post-production. There's a longer, and better film in here, much like there was with Kingdom of Heaven, and hopefully we will see it one day. If we do, the result will surpass even the aforementioned film, unhampered as Exodus is by a weak leading man. Finally, a word on the religious orthodoxy of it all. As an areligious viewer - one who really liked the much more conservative Prince of Egypt (1999) and Ten Commandments (1956), by the way - it's easier for me to take the events as presented here at face value, and to accept them within the context of a very real world, whereas the two other cited films seemed firmly rooted in legend or myth. And fundamentally, the film accomplishes that by virtue of sticking close to its main character, whose development a longer, richer cut would have further emphasized.This is nowhere near the fiasco many claimed it to be, nor is it a 100% satisfying experience. It is a very intriguing portrait with some interesting ideas, one that would be much easier to accept were Scott to play his cards with the frankness of say, Peter Jackson, and pick his battles in editing more decisively.Keep your fingers crossed for that extended cut then.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
102,Danny_G13,Underwhelming and lacking substance,6,12 May 2015,"*SOME INCREDIBLY MILD SPOILERS*As a huge fan of Blade Runner, Alien, Gladiator and even Prometheus, I have always been a great admirer of Ridley Scott, and it goes without saying he's one of the most respected directors Hollywood has to offer, with a CV few can match.Which is why I trusted him implicitly with an epic as big as this, and with a cast including the mighty Christian Bale.Unfortunately, while not atrocious, Exodus is a criminally underwhelming tale which leaves very little impression on the viewer at all.As other reviews have stated, it is the tale of Moses and the Ten Commandments, essentially, and how he was deceived as a child about his heritage and origin, and how discovery of this led the Emperor Ramses to exile him from Egypt, as thousands of Hebrew slaves continued to be controlled by the ruler.And their escape.It isn't much of a spoiler to reveal that, given that is the Biblical tale in a nutshell already.The problem here is the woeful miscasting, surprisingly passionless direction and bland cinematography.Bale doesn't do a BAD job as Moses but he, without sounding 'anti-semetic' here (I'm Jewish myself) can't really pass himself off as Jewish without tanned skin and a beard, apparently. Until then, it is hard to buy him as a Hebrew.Joe Edgerton's Ramses is unconvincing - initially overwhelmed by everything, he turns into a monster for no real reason, and turns on Moses, who only wants his people to be safe.Sigourney Weaver is the most wasted casting I have ever seen, she barely qualifies as a cameo. Did she just take the money and run here? Ben Kingsley's Nun is actually OK, not brilliant, but OK - you will never get average from such a stellar performer, but strangely the best cast character is John Torturro's Seti, who does carry an air of authority about him.And Dar Salim is ludicrously likable, for Ramses' second in command Khyam, and seems to be on the wrong side. A very confusing portrayal but it's not Salim's fault, it's the script and direction.And we come to Scott. This just lacks bite, passion, and fails miserably to be compelling. While it doesn't quite plod along, it certainly doesn't flow especially well, and the editing is especially disjointed. Certain events happen too suddenly without smooth transition and it can be quite jarring. And Scott's plain dislike for courtship is evident here as Moses goes from looking at a girl he's just met while she weaves twine, to literally in the next scene marrying her. There's no time for the relationship to become believable, and I am as against drawn-out relationship building as anyone else. But it has to be plausible and fleshed out.Lastly for an epic the cinematography is absolutely feeble. Few cascading landscapes and well-shot scenes, and mostly fast-faced frenetic action with slow and ponderous interludes.This is just a messy film and way below Ridley's expected standard.You'll find better ways to spend 150 minutes of your life.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
103,shawneofthedead,A misfire that manages to be daring and mediocre at the same time.,5,14 December 2014,"There's no such thing as bad publicity, or so the saying goes. The producers of Ridley Scott's latest epic, Exodus: Gods And Kings, would probably beg to differ (though, one might argue, they should have seen it coming). In the weeks leading up to the film's release in cinemas, Exodus has been dogged by criticisms of racism and whitewashing: specifically, the casting of Caucasian actors like Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and Sigourney Weaver in the roles of ancient Egyptians and Hebrews. It's a wave of controversy that could cast a pall on a truly excellent film - which Exodus, unfortunately, isn't. Miscasting aside, the film boasts some thoughtful, interesting ideas and incredible production values. But the script also meanders for too much of its running time, increasingly trading depth, complexity and logic for empty, if effective, spectacle.Moses (Christian Bale) knows no life other than that of the wealth and privilege of the Egyptian royal family. He is raised as a brother to heir apparent Ramses, leads Egyptian armies into battle, and turns a blind eye to the plight of the Hebrews - hundreds of thousands of people labouring in quiet slavery to build the great monuments of Egypt. But Moses comes to learn of his true lineage: he is himself Hebrew, brought to the palace by his sister as a baby when an order goes out for the mass slaughter of first-born Hebrew boys. Exiled from the empire after Ramses uncovers the truth, Moses wanders in the wilderness, finding first a wife and child, and subsequently his faith. Compelled by his God, Moses returns to warn Ramses of the catastrophic misfortunes that will plague the Egyptians if they continue to deprive the Hebrews of their freedom.To its credit, Exodus is more thoughtful and daring than you might expect. Scott has crafted an origin story for Moses that doesn't treat him simply as an iconic figure to be venerated. Indeed, the audience is invited to question whether Moses' convictions - which spring from a vivid dream involving a burning bush and an omniscient presence in the form of a child - might be the delusions of a madman. He's shown speaking furtively to thin air as grand plans for war and escape are constructed around him, while murder and death accompany his campaign to unsettle Ramses and the Egyptian people. It's a brave move to suggest that a just war blessed by a god can still leave a trail of horror and bodies in its wake: that terrorism and zealotry are never far away when faith is the battleground upon which people fight.Production values are, of course, top-notch. This is old-fashioned, large-scale movie-making at its finest. The Egyptian palace is grand and sweeping, while the crush of battles fought feels bruising and devastatingly real. There's a crunch of veracity here that you don't get from pictures wreathed in CGI (though there is plenty of that in this film as well). In a very real sense, Exodus is a spectacle. Scott practically dares you to breathe during a heartstopping mountain- side sequence, as Ramses forces his army to navigate a tiny path with death awaiting just over the precipice. When the inevitable happens, men, chariots and horses tumble through a landslide of rocks and mud, and it's almost terrifying to watch.But Exodus also struggles with a mediocre screenplay, one that's credited to four writers - with two more reportedly having done uncredited polishes. The good ideas are lost in a steady stream of trite, ponderous dialogue, while character development seems to be forgotten as the movie goes on. There's a half-hearted attempt to give Ramses some layers at the beginning: he may be the stereotypically callous, spoilt heir to the throne, but he at least seems to have a true kinship with his adopted brother. This disappears around the same time that Moses shows up to warn Ramses of the plagues that will soon befall Egypt - an almost literal trade-off between depth and spectacle. Those plagues are stirringly brought to life, as the rivers run red with blood and crocodiles and locusts leech health from Ramses and his people. But the film never quite manages to reconcile this very Old-Testament rage from the heavens with either science or emotion.In any other film, the heavyweight cast Scott has assembled would be reason enough to head to the cinema. That doesn't work out too well in Exodus, since his best actors are either struggling with leaden dialogue or given next to nothing to do. Bale soldiers sternly through the film, shouldering the weight of it all well enough but never really forging a credible emotional connection with either his character or audience. Edgerton is buried beneath plenty of make-up and eyeliner in a role that loses depth the longer he remains on screen, while Weaver and Aaron Paul are consigned to thankless parts that could have been played by just about anybody. It doesn't help, either, that they are all generally miscast: beyond the evident whitewashing of the times in which the film is set, there's also an almost hilarious irony to the fact that Bale, bearing the first name he does, is playing Moses. In retrospect, it's easy to find fault with Exodus - there are very few more depressing examples of how a big-name director can rush a film into existence despite a middling script and a questionable casting policy. The final product isn't quite as disastrous as the many plagues that befall the Egyptians. But, for a film that would, by its very nature, already be a lightning rod for controversy and religious debate, it really did itself no favours in sacrificing complexity for spectacle and justifying racism with box-office considerations.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

105,fil-nik09,Hmmm...,5,29 March 2015,"I was hesitant about the note to this movie... I find so many things bad, but, on the other hand, i can see its adventure side and good scenography. So, it is neither good, not bad. I am not a religious person, or not much. I know this story from the Bible because I do like artistic side of the book, but ... God as a child? God who punishes in order to get revenge? God who guides the people to leave them? Not to get into political and religious aspect, but I find the movie to have pictured one side in a very bad way...purposely or not.The biggest minus for me in the film is: people cross the sea and they are HIGH on the rocks with abyss of 20 meters or something...and then Moses and others come on the sandy beach???!!! Like what the hell?! If you don't have anything better to do, it is entertaining.But if you do, skip it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
106,disinterested_spectator,Rendering the Exodus Suitable for the Twenty-first Century,5,23 October 2016,"One of the first things we notice about this movie is that it follows ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) in making Moses an Egyptian general or at least a high-ranking officer, even though there is no indication of this in the ""Bible."" This may be a way of staving off the idea that Judaism and Christianity are, as Nietzsche argued, religions suitable for slaves, which is to say, those who are weak. To counter this, Moses is portrayed as a mighty warrior.There is a big difference between these two movies, however, in their attitudes toward the supernatural. In the 1956 movie, we never have any doubt that God exists and is actively causing all the miracles. At one point, Rameses dismisses the plagues as a sequence of natural phenomena. But we know better. The plagues are God's doing. In ""Exodus: Gods and Kings,"" on the other hand, the story is naturalized and secularized, God's existence not being required: Moses is told by Zipporah that he was hit on the head, and so whatever he thinks he saw was just a hallucination; the plagues of Egypt seem to unfold in the manner described by the Rameses of the 1956 version; and the Red Sea parts owing to a tsunami, perhaps caused by a comet. I suppose the idea is to make the story acceptable to a modern audience. But this is misguided. People who believe in the literal truth of the ""Bible"" will find this rendering disappointing, and people who do not take these stories seriously don't care. It's not as though once we have purged God from the ""Bible,"" what is left over is historical fact; so you might as well tell the story in all its supernatural glory, much in the way we do with any other mythological tale. Who wants to see a remake of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963) in which all that happens is explained as natural phenomena?Is it my imagination, or were there subtle allusions to the holocaust in this film? When the Egyptian soldiers were searching for Moses's relatives, who then hid in a secret place beneath the floor, it called to my mind scenes in which a Jewish family would hide from the Nazis when they came to their house. This ties in with a scene toward the end of the movie, just after the parting of the Red Sea, in which Moses expresses his misgivings about what will happen when all his people enter Canaan. In other words, he is worried about the genocidal slaughter described in ""Joshua,"" ""Deuteronomy,"" and ""Samuel,"" in which everyone in a conquered city is killed. And this raises a question I have often wondered about. It was a common practice in the ancient world for the conquerors of a people to kill all the men of military age, and then sell the women and children into slavery. But were the Jews the first race to kill all the women and children also? If so, that would be an ironic bookend to the holocaust of the twentieth century.In any event, the people that produced this movie apparently liked the idea put forward in the 1956 movie, that it was Rameses who first threatened to kill all the firstborn Hebrews, making it looks as though he started it, thereby precipitating the tenth plague as a kind of turnabout's fair play.At the end of the movie, when Moses seems to be very old, I cannot tell if Zipporah is still around or not, but in any event, there is no Ethiopian wife to be seen. Now, it was one thing for the 1956 version to avoid divorce and miscegenation, but this is the twenty-first century. Moses could have divorced Zipporah and married the Cushite woman, as she is sometimes called. Or Zipporah could have been the Ethiopian woman all along. But these matters are avoided here just as carefully as they were sixty years ago.Finally, there is the matter of God's being a child. Several theories have been advanced, and there are the reasons given by Ridley Scott, but I have a pet theory of my own. When the 1956 version of the movie was being made, the heroes in movies were typically bachelors. The hero might get married at the end of the movie, but as often as not he remained a bachelor. As the years went by, however, and the baby boomers got married and started having children, heroes in the movies began to follow suit. And so the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies featured a married cop with children and widower cop who is almost suicidal with grief. The ""Die Hard"" movies featured a married cop as well, estranged from his wife, at least in the first one. A child played a big role in each of ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2."" And so on. This is not an absolute distinction between then and now, of course, but rather a question of frequency. In a similar way, political speeches back in the 1950s were relatively sparing in their references to children, whereas politicians of the last thirty years or so have really been laying it on thick when it comes to families and children.And so, in a society that seems to be saturated with the importance of family and children, a bachelor God seems a little out of step with the times. I suppose the movie could have given God a wife (the future Virgin Mary, perhaps?), but that might be a little too much. Instead, making God a child was not only a safer way for the movie to conform to this recent trend, but also acts as a metaphor for the way our society sometimes seems to worship children.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
107,Figgy66-915-598470,I like this film,9,30 December 2014,"30 December 2013 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Exodus Gods and Kings. Dedicated to the memory of of his Brother Tony Scott, this is Ridley Scott's Biblical epic of gigantic proportions reminiscent of those epics of old such as Ben Hur, Spartacus and The Ten Commandments. Whether accurate or not, and the debate rages on, this version of the story of Rameses and Moses is brought vividly to life making full use of modern technology and know how to produce, battles, plague, swarms of locusts and raging storms. We see Rameses increasingly desperate as grip on his kingdom is weakening and his increasing rage as he tries to prevent Moses leading his people into freedom. Moses was played admirably by Christian Bale and Rameses by Joel Edgerton. Lesser roles but by no means smaller characters were played by Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley. This had a running time of 150 minutes and every single minute was filled with minute details of biblical history. The sets were magnificent and we see-sawed from Egypt looking at it's most opulent best, to a decimated city emerging from the aftermath of much death and destruction. Add a beautiful soundtrack and you have an extremely watchable film. Nice horses too!!!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
108,Rendanlovell,*face palm*,5,11 December 2014,"Going into exodus I had decently high expectations. I mean you have an all star cast and a master of a director, what can go wrong? A lot, a lot can and does go wrong. I will start by saying, it's nice to see that it's doesn't start in the typical beginning. Instead opens on an already aged moses. Ridley Scotts distinct style of cinematography is on display and is as good as ever. This helps to capture Egypt and all it's CGI glory. While the film is suitably epic in a technical sense it fails in nearly every other aspect. While Christian Bale is superb as Moses and brings a fresh take on the character, Ben Kingsley, Aaron Paul, sigourney Weaver, and Joel Edgerton are horribly under cooked. Either not having any kind of development or so little that it makes no difference to the character. Every iconic thing that Moses does is ripped to shreds or not featured. Including, His staff turning into a serpent, parting the red sea, HIS STAFF, turning the Nile into blood, and the 40 years in the wilderness. So, basically everything that people are going to see this film for is very poorly executed. Instead focusing on making the plagues and whatnot feel like they actually could happen. An all around lazy effort in very sense save for the technical side. And can someone tell me why GOD was a dirty child with a bad haircut??",Exodus - Gods and Kings
109,akash_sebastian,Famous Epic Director Ridley Scott fails to create an epic out the already famous and established Biblical epic.,5,16 December 2014,"The year began with the not-so-interesting adaptation 'Noah', and now ends with the weak and ineffective 'Exodus'. Ridley Scott is known to create epic movies, but I wonder how he failed to propel this already existing biblical epic to such heights. The story lacked proper character-development, and didn't have a heart at all. It didn't feel like an inspiring tale of freedom or punishment.And the whole ambiguity he tries to create by creating doubt in the God part was seriously ridiculous and didn't work at all. Moses keeps talking to God, in the the vision of a child shepherd, who is visible to no one else. So one might wonder whether he is actually there or they just Moses' delusions, but that wouldn't make any sense at all because such events like the plague, death of first-borns, dieing of crops, etc. don't easily happen by chance or nature.The biggest disappointment of them all was the omission of the splitting of the Red Sea' by Moses staff, and I really wonder why; I felt like pulling my hairs out. The water level decreases and these people cross the sea, but why was it omitted? I mean, that's the main thing people expect to see on screen when they're watching a movie on Moses.In every aspect, the movie is mediocre at best, except the visual effects (which are quite few and scattered apart). If one wants to watch a movie on Moses, I would still recommend them to watch 1956's 'The Ten Commandments' or 1998's animated musical 'Prince of Egypt', both are better than this film in all regards.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
110,trublu215,A complete mess of a film,1,12 January 2015,"Exodus tells the story of Moses getting the Jews away from Egypt and out of slavery. Everyone knows the story, it has been engraved into our memories through the Bible, through films and countless other platforms. Why, in 2014, would we need another version of it? Is it because Ridley Scott wanted a blockbuster? Is it because CGI could put a more modern spin on the age old story? We could argue why all day but the biggest ""why"" of them all is why in the hell is this movie so bad. Exodus seems like a sparknoted version of the Charlton Heston classic and it packs even less of a punch. As it trades set pieces for green screen, it pretends to care about the story, it pretends that these performances are good and it pretends these effects are realistic (they're not). Starring Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton, Exodus is melodramatic, ridiculous and corny. Directed with, what feels like, no passion, it stands as Ridley Scott's worst film. There isn't much more to say about this film other than that it is terrible, and a waste of its 2 plus hour running time and $165 million budget. Viewer beware!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
111,cinephile-27690,Very good IF you have an open mind.,9,26 June 2019,"As a Christian, I take the Bible very seriously. In Deuteronomy 4:2, God tells the Israelites: ""You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.""When Bible movies add things God did not place in His words, it can be bothersome to me-though I do enjoy movies like Noah and The Last Temptation of Christ. I have realized overtime that these movies are not intended to be the Bible onscreen, but rather inspirations from the director's mind, and not literal adaptations. That's all I will say on that here, before I get off topic or, perhaps, controversial.Exodus: Gods and Kings was directed by Ridley Scott, who's an atheist. His interpretation of the classic Moses story was originally one of the 10 worst movies I had ever seen, and I therefore gave it a 2/10. You can tell that from older reviews I have written.I mentioned that last month at a church youth group meeting when we compared the Burning Bush scenes in The Ten Commandments, The Prince of Egypt, and this. We all cringed at this version of it, which has many changes, such as Moses falling in quicksand and breaking his leg and a little boy talking to Moses, not the bush. But we compared it to the book of Exodus and found similarities between the Biblical narrative and the movie.However, on June 11th, 2019 I rewatched Exodus Gods and Kings and realized that it very much requires an open mind-and one with a movie in mind and not The Bible. It does follow the overall skeleton structure of the story, but it puts new flesh on it. I gave you the Burning Bush example, and I'll leave you to the others to examine yourself.I have heard that the effects are dull, but I highly disagree! The Red Sea Parting looks awesome, and I'm sure Cecil B. DeMille is rolling in his grave that Scott could make it cooler! The Plagues are nice too, I truly believed that all the water turned to blood and that insects and frogs were covering Egypt. Exodus Gods and Kings has set the standard for epic film-making in the regard of special effects!I also think the pacing is nice. It runs for exactly 2.5 hours and it felt more like 2. Some think The Ten Commandments(a nearly 4 hour movie) felt shorter, and AT TIMES I could see that, but it definitely does not apply to the whole film.On a grade scale of A+ to F, I am going to have to give this a simple A. I did have a couple of inaccuracy and other minor issues, ones I would rather not mention in favor of how much I admired Exodus Gods and Kings my 2nd time around, and they are also rather hard to put into words. But that is besides the point. There is so much good it overshadows any issues.In respect of Ridley Scott's vision, I admire and recommend Exodus Gods and Kings. Like I said, it requires an open mind to watch it, not a Bible to movie comparison. It's astonishing effects and unique storytelling(which I should note make you wonder what Moses's life was like out of the Bible's teachings) and interesting casting choices make this a pretty good Bible movie for the modern audience who want a fresh take on Moses.It's epic, it's grandly shot, and it's Ridley Scott's interpretation of Moses. Take it or leave it. I took it, and now I admire it! I could make more comments in favor of the movie, but for now I'll take an Exodus from this review! Exodus Gods and Kings is a spectacular vision and one worth experiencing if you are interested.As of 10/8/19: Movies I ""Really Like"" and ""Liked"" will be 9/10 stars.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
112,badajoz-1,"De Mille (twice) and Chuck Did It So Much Better, Ridley.",1,7 January 2015,"I really do not know why this film was made - it is just such a boring mess! I know the director Ridley Scott would have been brought up on afternoon long epics in the Fifties and Sixties, and it would appear that he thinks he can do them better for modern audiences, eg Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and this concoction. But he is terribly terribly wrong. He makes long movies with some thrilling visuals, true, but his films (since Blade Runner) have mostly lacked anything like a decent script and absolutely no characterisation. And here it happens again. The story of Exodus is re-imagined with an existential, faith all over the place Moses troubled like some latter day Marlon Brando figure in On The Waterfront; Ramses is some SS thug from a concentration camp circa 1943; and God (after a nod to the burning bush) is represented by a young boy. None of this works at all! So why bother, Sir Ridley? The classic confrontations between a rampant Old Testament Charlton Heston and a proud, domineering Yul Brynner are replaced by silly, sly meetings between Bale and Edgerton down in the stables, where Bale sympathises with his 'brother' but apologises for all the plagues because God is so vengeful! Most of the dialogue is confusing, and other smaller matters like the character of the High Priestess ( who must be putting the cause of female bishops in Africa back another millennium by being such a cheeky chops!) and the role of the Palace females who pop in and out to no effect (how Sigourney Weaver had the cheek to take the money I don't know). No, don't go to this mish mash, unless you want to see Scott take more than a few swipes at rampant Zionism and the irony of modern day Israel oppressing the Palestinians. Instead sit back and revel in some real old fashioned spectacle with the King of the Epics - Charlton Heston - as he frees his people from tyranny - all with a commentary from Cecil B de Mille himself in the remake of 'The Ten Commandments.' There is no tapping out on stone here at the dictation of a lad of those commandments, but a full blooded bolts of fire from Heaven,",Exodus - Gods and Kings
113,rehmankhilji,A bad presentation,3,16 March 2015,"10 commandments is an all time classic movie. Not only it was presented in an authentic way, that is according to ancient scriptures but the movie was a treat even if watched now. When you have Christian Bale as an actor and a renowned director, you for all the obvious reasons want to watch the movie. This one however from the minute start was utterly disappointing. I don't know on which lines were they presenting the movie. Was the director has his own literature with respect to Prophet Moses? Not only the story was out of line but i was presented in one horrible way. There are many religious scriptures which describes Prophet Moses and His story, an adaption of the same, with such good actors and with modern technology it could be a treat to watch. However, this was disappointing and utterly boring movie to see. Prophet Moses staff was the key, not shown and replaced with it a sword. Many other events were also changed and were presented in one bad manner. Christian Bale was acting more like Batman rather then Moses, same looks, same expression and same way of delivering dialogues. Prophet Moses though was a prince of Egypt but not this kind of super hero as shown. Rest of the cast was just time passing, non of character were having looks of Egyptian and the casting is horrible. I wondering why even i am giving it a three star, should be a minus 10 for what i have seen. In short bad movie, badly made and good waste of some actors and technology.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
114,higherall7,Hollywood Moses is interesting and fun...,7,14 December 2014,"Just finished going to see 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' and enjoyed its fresh and novel interpretation of Biblical events. We wore the 3-D glasses and the film excels when it comes to relating the miraculous events of Exodus involving animals and the forces of Nature in CGI.Oddly enough, I liked it more because of the liberties it took with the original source material and it efforts to relate the story of Moses in a more realistic and naturalistic way. There are, of course, historical inaccuracies galore, but I could easily see how director Ridley Scott was trying to relate this to modern times. The symbolism of replacing the Staff of Truth with the Sword of War was also not lost on me, though it represents somewhat spotty and specious reasoning to me.Christian Bale makes an impressive Moses, but I'll always be partial to Charleton Heston and how he made Michelangelo's Moses get down from his pedestal and come alive. Ridley Scott's version of the story is less beautiful than De Mille's 'Ten Commandments' and the character interaction isn't as poetic and romantic as the 1956 version, but it was great to see what you could do with this story using state-of-the-art 21st Century movie technology.We went to the Star Theater and one of the things that was interesting was the ubiquitous use of computer technology to serve the patrons everything from popcorn to lemonade and even to locate the seats where we would be sitting on their monitor. You don't even have to dry your hands anymore or push a button on a machine in the restroom. You just stick your hand down between two metal shells and hot vacuum style air does it for you! All of the seats in the Theater bore buttons on the side you could use to turn the place where you sat into a reclining chair and I thought how all this was a far cry from those sticky floors covered with the gummy residue of Ju-Ju-Bees candy in the Admiral Theater. Into this milieu of labor saving and comfort enhancing devices comes the story of Moses and indeed it seemed to me such an environment required at least a stab at a new take on an old idea. How outside of the Church and personal experience do you make the message of Exodus relevant to a new generation and new age blessed with so many technological advantages? Why focus on the spectacular with the latest in special effects! Joel Edgerton makes an interesting, brooding Rameses, but Yul Brynner is a tough act to follow. This, even more than 'Ten Commandments', is a spectacle driven entertainment rather than one driven by the transformations involving the characters. Both Bale and Edgerton seem pretty much the way they were at the beginning of the story albeit a little more beat up, but this is no real criticism. Both present characters who struggle with the meaning of God in their own way and at the end find themselves on opposite ends of the fence or should I say shore? The death of all the first born of Egypt during the Passover scene does not have the emotional impact it could, and here the responsibility for this rests solely with the writer and the director. But the flight from Egypt across the Red Sea, though lacking the magic of 'Ten Commandments', is thrilling and suspenseful and may seem more plausible and realistic to devotees of the History Channel.All in all, I found it a good afternoon at the movies, and for something even better you can always crack open the Good Book and just start reading with a friend...",Exodus - Gods and Kings
115,the_wolf_imdb,"Disgusting, sickening adaptation of sickening propaganda",1,16 August 2016,"Let's say this in a simple manner: Exodus is really sickening part of the Bible. It is not only horrific lie, it is a huge insult of a entire nation of Egypt. For starters - there were no slaves in Egypt. You could be captured in the battle or you could be sent to the forced labor, but there was no legal concept of slavery as in Greek or Roman times. You could always become a part of the Egypt society if you would accept their rule.The entire story of Exodus is a story of hatred, supremacist, intolerance and genocide. It is a sickening part of Jewish culture, basically the first holocaust ever mentioned.But this movie takes this insult to a very new level: It is not only story of intolerant and hateful God who strikes his punishments on innocent folks of Egypt, but also story of Moses creating his own Taleban. To add insult to the injury the authors describe ""the pharaoh"" as historical figure of Ramesse The Great and what's more, they portray him basically as a nazi dictator.This movie is described as ""historical drama"". It might be a drama, but it is not historical. It is like Himmler and Goebbels wrote ""The history of Jews"" - blatant, disgusting insulting lie.

Their acting abilities become diluted by the overly-serious tone, restricting them to playing only a fraction of their character's potentials.It doesn't get any better at the film moves forward, relying on the biblical storyline to carry the rest of the production: more famous actors and panoramic scenes are exploited, but nothing makes any meaningful impact on the viewer whatsoever.

When you have a plot interesting as Exodus has, lead actor as good as Bale and visuals as stunning as Exodus has, then result should have been great but Exodus misses the bus because execution is dull and chemistry is missing between the key characters.Ridley Scott fails to infuse the high energy level in Exodus that we cherished in cult Gladiator. Rather portraying it as a faith movie, he could have opted for showing the human spirit that goes against all odds. Apart from Bale, there is hardly any other memorable character. The length of 150 minutes feels too long. However, great visuals and great CGI work especially in the climax help movie in not being a complete disaster. I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for Exodus. What could have been a great cinematic experience turns out to be an underwhelming one.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
120,MickeyTheConstant,Not Really Sure About This One,6,4 January 2019,"I was really confused how to rate this movie. As a spectacle and action movie it was good. Good battle scenes, great CGI, decent performances especially from Bale. But I am Catholic and no matter how much you view this as an action movie it is very much aimed at being a historical masterpiece and it's there where it fails. It is really inaccurate and bordering on offensive. Sometimes there is a degree of artistic licence a director can use but I think where religion is concerned they should not stray as it such a sensitive subject and means so much to many. A decent action movie but no more than that and if you are Christian or Catholic I would probably give it a swerve",Exodus - Gods and Kings
121,krzysiektom,not good,2,25 December 2014,"It seems that Ridley S. has been directing films for too long. His every next movie is weaker than the previous one. ""Exodus"" offers some nice vistas with lots of extras and special effects to boot, but the film is poorly written, cowardly and compromising in its depiction of the biblical controversial story of Moses and the Exodus, with mediocre acting, weakly directed action scenes and an irritating musical score. I saw it on Christmas Eve, the theater was packed full with people and they laughed loudly during several scenes and these scenes indeed felt awkward, out of place and time, ridiculous. What makes the Moses and Exodus story interesting in the Bible are its controversies: God says there are other gods too but smaller and inferior; God says he is for Hebrews exclusively and not for other people; God says he will confuse and stiffen Pharoah's mind so that he will continue to reject Moses' offers to let Hebrews go, therefore there was no fair play with the Egiptians from the start; God punishes first-born children of all Egiptians no matter how innocent; God needs Jewish houses to be marked with lamb blood for that, as if he could not tell them apart; the Jewish Passover turns out to be a celebration of the infanticide of non-Hebrew children; God says that Hebrews should plunder their Egiptian neighbors before leaving Egipt and Moses has 3000 fellow Hebrews slaughtered for praying to another god. However none of this you will find in the film, which is a pity. In the film it is Moses and his troops who initiate the plagues and attacks on Egitptians. Why? Because allegedly ""only the Egiptian people can force Pharoah to change his mind about Hebrew slaves"". Apparently this film is for the viewers stupid enough to think that the ancient Egipt was a republic or a democracy, and not a monarchic dictatorship.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
122,Bento_de_Espinosa,Excellent to expose the stupidity of biblical literalists,10,6 March 2015,"I'm giving this film a 10, not because it's an excellent movie (it's a OK movie). I'm giving it a 10 for the courage of its makers to deviate from the biblical narration, although it could have been an even looser interpretation of the Exodus story, since it never happened in reality anyway.I'm amazed and amused at the same time by the many negative reviews given by angry religious people who are mad at the film makers for not sticking to the ""historical facts"". Are you kidding me? These people read a story that for centuries was orally passed from generation to generation, until it one day, some 2,500 years ago, i.e. many centuries after the supposed events, got written down, and they call it ""historical facts""?!If this story happened the way the Bible tells it, then biblical literalists really are worshiping a sadistic tyrant, who kills innocent people and even children. Is this what they want?Please think: You have 400 years of Hebrew presence in Egypt and about 2,000,000 people (600,000 men + their families + a number of non Hebrews) walking for 40 years in the desert, and despite 200 years of intense search absolutely nothing has ever been found that shows that this biblical tale really took place. Zero, nada, niente! Even many Jews don't believe in it anymore. In the 1970s archaeologists gave up searching for evidence.So, why should a film about the Exodus stick to the ""facts"" when this story is not based on facts?If religious people want historical facts, how about this one: according to the Jewish Encyclopedia, fact is that the Hebrews were polytheists. After the Babylonian exile (around 500 BC), the prophets compelled them to stick with Yahweh (Jehovah), who was just one of their many gods, but had become the main one.And if you think Moses was a man of God, then open your Bible now and read Numbers 31:13-18. That was Moses! And in Deuteronomy 13:6-10 Yahweh himself commands the Israelites to kill their own families, if they turn to other gods. If you believe in the Bible, this is the god you are following!Again, the film is not superb, but not bad either.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
123,JohnWelles,Beautiful but Dramatically Flawed Epic,7,25 February 2015,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" (2014), directed by Ridley Scott is a return to the oft-told Biblical story, most famously filmed by Cecil B. DeMille in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), of Moses liberating the Israelites. However, Scott, currently cinema's foremost director of historical epics with ""Gladiator"" (2000), ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) and ""Robin Hood"" (2010), attempts to bring a fresh approach to a sporadically revived genre that has lain largely dormant for decades.""Exodus"" though, only partially succeeds. Despite running for two and a half hours, the film still feels abbreviated and characters unnecessarily abandoned (Scott has claimed his preferred cut would another ninety minutes). Many of the fine supporting cast, including Aaron Paul, Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver, have little development and merely deliver exposition of the picture's plot, serving more as ciphers than real characters. Even the adventurous decision of having God portrayed as a petulant child by Issac Andrews backfires, lacking the requisite gravitas. The film is left feeling oddly diminutive despite the massed thousands of slaves or Egyptian soldiers, brought to life by some uneven computer generated imagery. Worse still, the script (by Steven Zaillian amongst others) seems to evade Moses himself; Bale is convincing but he's asked to create nuances that just aren't there. Joel Edgerton, as Ramesses, and John Turturro, playing Seti, fare better, embodying the complex court politics of the pharaohs' rule.However, all is not lost. If the cast are left to fend for themselves by the script, then at least we can regale in Scott's beautiful craft. Early scenes, of Ramesses extracting venom from snakes or Mosses visiting a slave encampment run by Ben Mendelsohn, show his grasp of the power of images, the positioning of the camera, the instinctive knowledge of when to cut, revealing Scott's visual complexity. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski uses digital photography to convey the harshness of the desert light, the unblinking intensity of the North African sun (the film was shot on location in Morocco as well as in Almería, Spain), that admirably shows the dirt and grit of the ancient world. Scott's movies always look extraordinary and this is no exception: the film's stand-out sequence is the ten plagues overwhelming the Egyptian capital of Memphis, the Nile turning red and the waves of all-consuming locusts and flies, a visual coup that belongs to a better thought-out film.""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is undoubtedly a flawed film, belonging to the lower tier's of Scott's filmography, and yet in its pictorial richness, it becomes strangely fascinating despite the neglect of a host fine thespians and the erratic quality of its special effects. An intriguing misfire then, that becomes more interesting than more tonally consistent studio pictures. Maybe the Director's Cut will be worth waiting for.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
124,headly66,New Find Shows Slaves Didn't Build Pyramids,1,18 December 2014,"Newly discovered tombs more than 4,000 years old and said they belonged to people who worked on the Great Pyramids of Giza, presenting the discovery as more evidence that slaves did not build the ancient monuments.The series of modest nine-foot-deep shafts held a dozen skeletons of pyramid builders, perfectly preserved by dry desert sand along with jars that once contained beer and bread meant for the workers' afterlife.The mud-brick tombs were uncovered in the backyard of the Giza pyramids, stretching beyond a burial site first discovered in the 1990s and dating to the 4th Dynasty (2575 B.C. to 2467 B.C.), when the great pyramids were built on the fringes of present-day Cairo.The ancient Greek historian Herodotus once described the pyramid builders as slaves, creating what Egyptologists say is a myth later propagated by Hollywood films.Egypt's archaeology chief Zahi Hawass said the latest finds show that the workers were paid laborers, rather than the slaves of popular imagination.Most importantly, he said the workers were not recruited from slaves commonly found across Egypt during pharaonic times.One popular myth that Egyptologists say was perpetrated in part by Hollywood movies held that ancient Israelite slaves — ancestors of the Jewish people — built the pyramids.Amihai Mazar, professor at the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says that myth stemmed from an erroneous claim by former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, on a visit to Egypt in 1977, that Jews built the pyramids.""No Jews built the pyramids because Jews didn't exist at the period when the pyramids were built,"" Mazar said.Dorothy Resig, an editor of Biblical Archaeology Review in Washington D.C., said the idea probably arose from the Old Testament Book of Exodus, which says: ""So the Egyptians enslaved the children of Israel with backbreaking labor"" and the Pharaoh put them to work to build buildings.""If the Hebrews built anything, then it was the city of Ramses as mentioned in Exodus,"" said Mazar.Dieter Wildung, a former director of Berlin's Egyptian Museum, said it is ""common knowledge in serious Egyptology"" that the pyramid builders were not slaves and that the construction of the pyramids and the story of the Israelites in Egypt were separated by hundreds of years.""The myth of the slaves building pyramids is only the stuff of tabloids and Hollywood,"" Wildung told The Associated Press by telephone. ""The world simply could not believe the pyramids were build without oppression and forced labor, but out of loyalty to the pharaohs.""Hawass said the builders came from poor Egyptian families from the north and the south, and were respected for their work — so much so that those who died during construction were bestowed the honor of being buried in the tombs near the sacred pyramids of their pharaohs.Their proximity to the pyramids and the manner of burial in preparation for the afterlife backs this theory, Hawass said.""No way would they have been buried so honorably if they were slaves,"" he said.The tombs contained no gold or valuables, which safeguarded them from tomb-raiders throughout antiquity, and the bodies were not mummified. The skeletons were found buried in a fetal position — the head pointing to the West and the feet to the East according to ancient Egyptian beliefs, surrounded by the jars once filled with supplies for afterlife.The men who built the last remaining wonder of the ancient world ate meat regularly and worked in three months shifts, said Hawass. It took 10,000 workers more than 30 years to build a single pyramid, Hawass said — a tenth of the work force of 100,000 that Herodotus wrote of after visiting Egypt around 450 B.C.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
125,abouhelier-r,Exodus: Gods and Kings,7,26 December 2014,"The defiant leader Moses rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues. Exodus: Gods and kings is directed by Ridley Scott, stars Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as Ramses. There are a lot of controversy around this movie. I really do love Ridley Scott. I have a huge respect for his work as he made some of the best sci-fie movies of all time and he continues to make a tone of films. First of all the opening battle sequence is spectacular and beautifully filmed. Everything from the ten plagues to the end of the Red Sea sequence is absolutely fantastic as well; though somethings in between are a bit hard to get through. Secondly, Joel Edgerton's character is good and he is a great actor, but not for that part; John Turturro stands out as an actor, he's almost comical. It's great to see Sigourney Weaver back in a Ridley Scott film even if she has like two lines so there's not much to be excited about. Plus, Ben Kingsley and Chistian Bale deliver really good performances. In fact Christian Bale ads a lot of emotion to Moses' character, as you can perfectly understand his family position and his life once he discovers about his youth. Moses is depicted differently than before as he really is human in this film and not this faithful unbreakable rock. However, it missed something about the brotherhood relationship between Moses and Ramses as they never really get to face each other till the end of the movie, we don't get to see their evolution. Finally, the last scene of the Red Sea is so well done, Ridley Scott genuinely knows epic and clearly understands how to show an awesome battle scene. The scope of this film is huge displaying a modern tale of Moses story in which Egypt never looked so big and grand; just like it should have been at that time.Overall the entire film looks beautiful with great performances from leading actors, I loved the epic scope but it may be a bit too long.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
126,Come-and-Review,"Not The Gladiator, but not that bad either",8,24 April 2017,"This film can be compared to some of the other ""minor"" historical films by Ridley Scott, particularly Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood. Both those movies, in my opinion, were saved thanks to their director's cut editions. Exodus yet didn't get this treatment.I cannot but disagree with anyone who gave a review worse or equal to 6. I have seen far more terrible historical films (300:rise of an empire, for example). What I did feel, was that some parts were missing. I can only guess for example that Sigourney Weaver had more than two scenes in the first place.I really appreciated the two leads: Christian Bale, and Joel Edgerton (even though I do agree that Ramses with blue eyes is rather strange), particularly Bale. It's not that he had a difficult role, but he really could fit the character of Moses, especially with that beard. The film did make me feel sympathy also for Ramses. For certain aspects, his character felt indeed motivated.Let me clarify: this film was not planning on being historically accurate. The only fully accurate things I recall were Ramses fighting at Qadesh, and the mouth opening ritual. Everything else, starting from the pillows, all the way to Abu Simbel being a Temple and not a tomb, were wrong. So don't expect this film to be historically accurate.On the other hand, the film was 85% accurate to the biblical account. Scott is an atheist, but that didn't prevent to the story being told with some religious accuracy. I found intriguing that, from certain points of view, it also lets the skeptical viewers distrust the depiction of the events. Moses could be hallucinating (only him sees the manifestation of God), most of the plagues have a rational explanation delivered by an Egyptian adviser. I personally would like to think that this was intentional. That said, the story was told the way it was written in the Bible, more or less accurately. I believe the criticism the film got for being too flat (something I personally disagree with) came because of that: the original story didn't have long dialogues or descriptions, it simply delivered the plot. Hence, the screenwriters had to figure out how to implement that in a motion picture, rather than figuring out ways to make the story less 'flat'. Some original elements were omitted, e.g. Moses' stammering, or the role of Aaron to the story. It is possible that the original cut had such scenes, but they mist have been deleted, because of time restrains. !aybe, in the future, a director's cut will bring justice to this down rated film. I enjoyed the film. It wasn't an outstanding or a top 250 film. It was an averagely good film, filled with stunning visuals. My actual rating would be of 7.5/10, I've put an 8/10 to balance out the current rating a bit.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
127,apjc,Had promise but failed miserably.,3,16 February 2018,"First hour I was thinking this is a good retelling of a great story. Moses and Pharaoh were portrayed as men, both with faults but neither good or evil. I usually hate religious epics sooner as I feel I'm being preached to. But then around 75 minutes I saw the creation of the Israeli Defence Force, you can push history so far, but not by centuries. After fleeing Egypt they did hold a small area for awhile, but then fell under the domain of all the great competing powers in the area. When the superpowers exhausted themselves in war, Jerusalem was theirs. Until the Romans arrived, then the Muslims followed by the Crusaders. Israel is a powerful state now, but only due to the diaspora or more importantly those in the USA. Why ruin what is a great story by rewriting it and history.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
128,stephendaxter,An attempt at an epic retelling of the story of Moses that falls short of being great,6,4 March 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is the latest adaptation of the story of Moses and his feud against the pharaoh Ramses to set free hundreds of thousands of slaves. The events explored in this film are ones that many would be familiar with, especially those who are religious, and seeing some of these events on screen made for the most memorable scenes of the movie. These historical events such as Moses' interactions with God (which i thought were done in a very interesting way), the parting of the Red Sea (also done with a different approach), and the 10 commandments were the movies attempt to stay as accurate and relevant even though some of these events were featured more heavily than others and some not at all. So from a historical standpoint i did like parts of this film. But these moments, the more significant ones, were spaced out very far apart and a lot of the in-between sections weren't all that interesting, it felt like at times the movie was just unnecessarily dragging on. The 2.5 hour runtime was definitely way too long, having this film sit at just under 2 hours, at 1 hour 50 minutes would have made it much better. It wasn't fault of the performances that made it very uninteresting, just that there was not enough going on to spend so much time at each of the two camps. In terms of the performances, i thought that Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton did pretty fine jobs, nothing too spectacular. But the inclusion of a mostly white cast as these historically non-white characters initially threw me off a little and was pretty noticeable but as the film went on i gradually became used to it and didn't end up hurting the film too much. Visually this film was epic, the scale of the cities that they built through CGI was stunning and even the minor special effects went unnoticeable. Also the battles i thought were relatively entertaining, it was too bad that there wasn't a whole lot of it, the film could have benefited from that. I must say i was a little underwhelmed by the final confrontation between Ramses and Moses, there was not a whole lot of build up prior to it but i still expected a little more than what i got. In the end Ridley Scott's epic retelling of the story of Moses some right historically, visually and in terms of the plot, but the way too long runtime and lack of interesting content brings this film down, nowhere near one of Ridley's best. - 6.5",Exodus - Gods and Kings

130,Spartan_1_1_7,"If nothing else, you can't deny the grandeur and epic scope of this film.",7,8 March 2015,"Exodus is yet another big budget Hollywood movie, the other being Noah, to be based on a biblical story. This time, it is about Moses. Christian Bale stars as Moses, who I believe was a good choice for the role and did pretty well. Can't say the same for Ramses, the evil Pharaoh. Joel Edgerton wasn't bad per say, but he didn't give this bad evil-ish vibe that I wish was present. The movie's writing is at fault here too. The second half of the movie, starting from the plagues till the end, was great. I loved the plagues and their presentation, they were thrilling and frightening. Would have been even better if there was some breathing room given to them and if there was more suspense created, but oh well. The finale was again Epic, with the red sea rushing back and all. Being a Ridley Scott film, you can surely expect a visual spectacle, and this movie certainly had many. Beautiful views of Egypt, epic scope, great overhead shots, great cinematography all in all. The CGI was mostly great. Egypt was beautifully realized and we get to feel its grandness. There were a few instances where green screen use was apparent. Soundtrack was decent, but I was kinda disappointed by it. Was hoping to have at least one great track that really gets you going.Now, the movie had it fair share of flaws. The first half or so got slow pretty soon after the epic opening battle and kinda got boring. The personal stuff, aside from Moses and Ramses conflict, wasn't interesting and bogged down the movie. Also, a child messenger representing God and all the talks that followed was really underwhelming. Would have been better if it was just a voice or something, they could have used Liam Neeson's voice. But my biggest complaint with the movie is that how anti-climatic the quintessential moment was, and I'm of course talking about the splitting of the Red sea. I was in so much anticipation about finally seeing that moment realized perfectly thanks to modern CGI and with Ridley Scott at helm, only to be extremely disappointed by seeing it reduced to nothing but a steady receding of the water. WTF Ridley Scott. I get that they were going for a more realistic approach or whatever, but CMON, somethings aren't meant to be changed/meddled with. Overall, even with the flaws, I still did like the movie. Don't hesitate to watch it because of the hate it got as majority of it is from extreme religious people or extreme atheists. Just go in with an open mind and you might enjoy it. If nothing else, you can't deny the grandeur and epicness of it. 7.8/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings
131,michaelhirakida,So Moses Didn't part the Red Sea? God Did?,8,12 December 2014,"Fine go ahead people thumbs down this review because I gave it an 8. I'm not that religious type of person. I am a huge Epic Film fan though with my favorites being King Of Kings, Gone With The Wind and Lawrence of Arabia. I have lots to talk about for Ridley Scott's newest Epic Film named Exodus Gods And Kings. There is going to be some heavy, heavy spoilers in this review.The telling of the book of Exodus and Moses is well known to many people. From what I understand from not reading the bible and looking at other peoples reviews, This film is mostly faithful to the book of Exodus. But I have some bones to pick with which will take up lots of this review.I think Christian Bale did fine as Moses. But it was Joel Edgerton's Ramses that I didn't like. Whenever he tried to be intimidating, his face looks like a freaking puppy. It might just be me, but who knows? What I don't understand about Ramses (I have not Watched The Cecil B. Demille version so just saying) is that when every single one of his men die when the Red Sea drowns them, he is the only one alive. Shouldn't he be dead? Why was he kept alive? To show his failure? I have not read The Bible or Exodus so I apologize for anything I don't understand.God as a child was another thing that bothered me. I think the kid did fine, but to be honest, I thought it would have been better if they had not had him at all or put him at the very end when Moses was craving the Ten Commandments. That would have been a great reveal if they did that. Not showing God as a Child following Moses around would have made it look much better in my opinion.The Parting of the Red Sea.... oh boy. So Moses Throws his sword that he had gotten into the water, then all of a sudden the next day, the seas part by god? From what I understand in the Demille version, Moses parts it himself. Also, wasn't it parted in two? Here, they have the whole red sea go to the east coast!Just a nitpick here, but the end where Moses is old, The Makeup on Bale is horrendous.OK. So enough about my problems with the movie. Let me talk about the good stuff. The sets are amazing and really look fitting for an epic. This is one of the best looking films I have seen in a while. Scott got many extras (4000 to be exact) to make the feel of the film look classical. Although the dialog doesn't have as much flare as movies like Gone With The Wind or Spartacus, the actors did the best job they could with the film. The battle at the beginning is great also showing the big scale of the whole film. But the ending where the Red Sea crashes into Ramses men was just predictable.The disasters that occur in Memphis are grand. With Thousands of Flies and Locusts attacking, Egyptian Children dying and animals dropping dead for no reason (Animal Cruelty happens A LOT in this film) makes the film more suspenseful and emotional. So I don't know if this is the Epic that will revive the genre, I didn't expect Ben Hur or anything, but for me, I liked it. From what it looks like, it is not being well received by Christian audiences, but judge it for yourself. Don't let the majority bother you. Its a grand film but it has its issues.88/100 B+",Exodus - Gods and Kings
132,rprince-832-6294,Epic with a side of missed opportunities,7,12 December 2014,"-This Ridley Scott epic tells the story of the exodus from Egypt, but from a little bit of a different interpretation. Read the rest before you judge just that though!-Imma get right into it and say that the pace is a little slow and the film could have been a little shorter.-One thing I did like was, in one scene in particular, there are a few minor time jumps that are like 'woah, what?' but then I realized the Bible does that, so it seemed cool.-The acting is pretty good Christian Bale does a great job and Joel Edgerton does a great job.-I love the music. It's like if you took the score from The Prince Of Egypt and made it longer and a little more authentic.-One of the best things about the film is that it is epic. The scale of Thebes and pretty much everything you see in it is massive and awesome to watch. There were probably some missed opportunities to look at the culture they were in, but Ridley Scott usually doesn't do that because it detracts from the story a little.-So let's go into the Christian part of it:1. There is no massive battle at the end. Told you! There is a battle at the beginning and some other intense scenes throughout, but it is not how the trailer looks.2. The interpretation of Moses in the film is probably not as strong as he really was, but he did have a lot of doubts and reservations that make him human. God also chose him as a general I guess, replacing the staff with a sword, which was unnecessary and not as cool or symbolic.3. The interpretation of God in the film is much better than in Noah! I'm going to go ahead and give a very small spoiler here: God appears to Moses throughout the film as a small child, which I find has some symbolic meaning about the nature of God and how He describes we should have our faith. That said, when child God is saying things, he sounds like he is complaining because it's a kid. I did like a lot of the things that child God did though! He grabs Moses and is like 'Hey, I need you.' and Moses is all 'Fine, but let me do it my way!' Doesn't work. God: 'You done?' Moses: 'I guess' God: Let me handle it my way now."" Plagues. So I liked the look at Moses trying to do things his own way and God waiting for Moses to humble himself before He helps him. God is also portrayed as a little brutal in the eyes of the Egyptians, but Moses explains it quite well and I don't want to give it away, but he basically tells the Egyptians 'Hey, my God saved us, what did your gods do?' -So let's talk about the events: I thought the killing of the guard was done well. It was a little different, but it left more suspense as Moses thought he got away with it, and then found out that he had been seen. The burning bush was cool, but I wish Moses would have been able to interact or take off his shoes or something. There is no turning the staff into snakes. Why? There are some obvious missed opportunities there. The plagues were pretty sweet though! Now I will say that they start somewhat different, with freaking huge crocodiles eating everything in the Nile, turning it to blood. Which causes frogs, which causes flies, and so on. Now as sweet at the crocodiles were, they were somewhat unnecessary. I did feel like they were put in there to show how God uses nature to accomplish His will, but it is not left unexplained, which God leaves many things. Aside from the crocs, the plagues were pretty sweet! -Let's move on to the actual exodus. They left and there are hundreds of thousands of these guys, but they did a good job as showing that. They got to the sea and pretty much everybody doubted but God, who helped reassure Moses. The current takes all the water away and in the biggest missed opportunity, there is no massive parting of the sea. They do cross on fry land and are chased, causing the massive sea to roll back in on the Egyptian army. Spoiler alert. Jk, story's been around for a few thousand years. But yeah, I missed the parting of the sea, but the sea going back was really cool! After that, God mas Moses make the commandments and then it jumps to older Moses in a wagon with a box behind him, presumably holding the commandments, which he puts his hand on. This can go one of two ways: Either this is before they officially make the Ark of the Covenant in the wilderness, which makes sense except that Moses is old; or that is the Ark, and Moses touched it, which doesn't make sense from Ridley Scott. So I like to think the former.-That's about all. So Exodus is a massively epic movie with some great acting, great music, and a lot of missed opportunities in it. Its faith story is much more intact that in Noah and there is nothing demonic, although there are some deviations from the Bible. In a fair rating, I would really only give Exodus a 7.5/10, but I am glad I saw it. So if you are looking for an epic 'interpretation' not 'adaptation' in which you probably will probably nitpick, but not get offended, Exodus is still worth seeing in theaters. If you are not sure, it's probably not to you. I would say it is though.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This an attempt at a revisionist version of the story. Here it is very much implied that he is a schizophrenic. I have no problem with that but what they do is done so badly on every level.Out goes the spectacle and scale. The film has one of the most trite and really bad scripts ever, the acting by everyone is beyond crap, i was not impressed with the visual effects. God is some 12 year old obnoxious boy. Moses is just agnry all the way through. The film was lifeless and just plodded on and on. i like Christian bale but he was no match in any way for Charlton Heston and Joel Edgerton was really pathetic compared to Yul Brynner. you feel nothing for anyone, this was like a badly done school play put on by 10 year olds.

134,metalrage666,"Disappointing, tedious and meandering garbage.",1,1 January 2015,"Oh dear, Ridley Scott you are certainly no Cecil b Demille. The much loved and acclaimed story, The Ten Commandments, was lauded for its originality, screenplay, portrayal and the sheer magnitude of how such a project could all come together particularly during the 1950's.Back then, rightly or wrongly, there was not the same emphasis or consideration placed on matters such as white versus black actors and how much screen time were given to minority roles, or that actors had credulity in roles where they didn't even look the part. No one in Hollywood cared whether or not a biblical movie would even be heard of let alone seen in certain parts of the world, but in todays modern climate where everything is interconnected and public opinion is shot around the world in nanoseconds, it's really surprising that a movie telling a story such as this could be done so haphazardly.Even if one were to overlook the fact that the Egyptian and Hebrew roles were given to all white Australian, American and English actors or that Moses' Kushite wife was portrayed as an almost modern scold and played by a Spaniard. If you can overlook the sheer number of anachronisms with the story or the so-called artistic license taken with the nature of the plagues that befell Egypt or overlook that Moses (once he learned his true heritage), allegedly became incoherent and abrasive to everyone around him, you may actually enjoy it.Although knowing all that still won't prepare you for the moment where God is played by a precocious and argumentative child with a BBC accent no less, which I just wished Moses would've have put over his knee at some point. And it won't prepare you for the moment where Moses, not God, actually writes the Ten Commandments. It won't even prepare you for the movies supposedly biggest moment where Moses parts the Red Sea and leads his people to freedom as according to Ridley Scott, that never happened. We are led to believe,(if you look at all the signs), that a comet crash landed somewhere, caused an undersea earthquake and the Red Sea became ""drained"". This opportune turn of events gave the Jews their chance to cross the now empty sea bed. Of course the Egytian chariots were summarily consumed by the tsunami that inevitably rolled in and wiped them all out; that is except for Ramses AND Moses who both somehow survived getting hit by a hundred foot wave traveling at hundreds of miles per hour and still managed to make it back to opposite shores. There is then only a brief depiction of the hedonism the Jews engaged in after their exodus of Egypt and no reference to the punishment given to them for their self-corruption. God the British boy-child simply looked down from the mountain and shook his head like any kid would when he's told he has to eat his greens before dessert.In almost 60 years since the Ten Commandments you'd expect Exodus to outshine in every way, but instead we get a washed out, lacklustre affair that seems to want to offend everybody at the same time. There is simply no excuse to skimp on authenticity under the guise of wanting to make a quick buck by putting in the alleged huge draw-card actors, knowing full well that what may have been irrelevant back in the 1950's simply isn't now. Exodus is a real disappointment.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
135,zacpetch,Did anyone involved with this movie even read the book of Exodus?,1,13 January 2015,"There's a very clear anti-religious agenda to this movie. It decides to take a story that is key to some of the biggest religious groups out there and drop the authenticity of the religious elements to it. Moses is important to the Jews and Christians for writing the Pentateuch/Torah and is one of the most frequently mentioned individuals throughout both the Old and New Testaments.What's so wrong with it? Well it focuses on the Biblical account as expected... supposedly. The truth is that you'd be forgiven for wondering if anyone who worked on this movie had even glanced at the source material, not even at Sunday school! There are too many errors to list, but I'll try my best:Moses was an elderly man in his eighties when he went before the Pharaoh having been on the run or in hiding for about 40 years but this film ignores that.The Pharaoh's identity cannot be identified for sure but we can say for sure it was not Ramses (admittedly I blame this one on ""The Prince Of Egypt"", but still... error!).God is portrayed as a mean-spirited child not the almighty divine YAHWEH (more often referred to as The LORD) who created the universe from nothing in six days by just speaking.God appearing to Moses in human form is incorrect too: He appears as a burning-but-not-burnt bush at this point, not a little boy with a bad temper.The movie tries to explain away the plagues as a series of natural phenomenon and this takes focus away from God and downplays his infinite power (only the plague of locusts comes even close to this in the Bible stating it was due to a wind but Exodus 10v13 makes it clear it was God's doing and not natural). How it manages to do this when the plagues are done in such a rush shows the clear intentions of the filmmakers to undermine the authority of the one who gives them life and by his mercy allows them to keep living.In a similar manner, the parting of the Red Sea is explained away by use of a convenient earthquake rather than the immense power of God.These errors are HUGE and some are blasphemous. Though the film is well made and has a great wealth of talent both sides of the camera it is not enough to make up for its many missteps. This is an insult to everything it touches and I'd advise all Christians, Jews and anyone who respects the beliefs of such people to stay well away from this. If you want a decent take on the Exodus story I'd refer you to ""The Prince Of Egypt"" instead, though that's not without fault either. Val Kilmer is a better Moses than Christian Bale (unlike that other famous role they've both played; I'm talking about Batman. Compare ""Batman Forever"" to ""The Dark Knight"").This movie looks and sounds great and is technically really good but it deviates so far from the source material it's sure to offend everyone who even slightly cares about it. This movie seems determined to reject any power the Holy Spirit has -- which is unforgivable if that truly was the intention (Matthew 12v42). I give this movie credit for displaying the dark elements of the story but it's nothing new that we haven't seen done already, both before and better.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
136,elenaphysics,Nothing different,6,12 December 2014,"Around Easter time in my country, a lot of movies about the Christ and the Bible are on TV. So, apparently is the story about Moses and the exodus of Israelis from the Egypt. I have watched since childhood a lot of movies on this subject. So I will compare this movie to those old classic Moses movies.. Well.. For me it was nothing different to those movies. Nothing too special. It was a tale from the Bible, narrating the way to exodus from the Egypt. The direction part was OK, the special effects were OK but just about that. It was nothing extraordinary. The actors for Ramses and Moses were a good choice I would say but just about that.. The scariest part of the movie was that little kid playing the voice of God. He truly was scary as he appeared in the desert by the night. In some cases , there were parts where you could feel they were trying to add a kind of humor in the movie.It was a bit disastrous. For example, the part where the 'scientist' tries to explain the reason of the plaques.. The only moving scene was the part of Ramses, saying goodbye to his little boy. That scene brought tears to my eyes and it is the reason I am giving the movie 6 stars. Because the actor playing Ramses was so good. About Moses, I have watched many movies with Cristian Bale.. I am not a fan of his. Out all of his movies I only enjoyed the Prestige.He was OK for the role though. If I were to judge the plot I would say it is OK. Only a few things were changed from the original story. But of course the story itself is obsolete.. I do not know why someone would enjoy a Biblic tale nowadays you know.. It was too hard to watch the Plagues of Pharaoh on the big screen. The reason I went to watch it , it was the free tickets I had. I do not think that I would be tempted to watch again a movie I have watched in so many variations since my childhood. And when Easter time comes, this movie would be a perfect fit for the TV. But nothing more you know..",Exodus - Gods and Kings
137,Freedom060286,Compares Poorly to The Ten Commandments,5,15 January 2016,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is inferior in every way to Cecil B. DeMille's great ""Ten Commandments"" epic.The acting is comparably poor. Christian Bale, although a great actor, was not the right person to play Moses (compared to Charlton Heston). And Joel Edgerton, although ideal for many other roles, was a poor choice as Ramses, especially compared to Yul Brynner in ""The Ten Commandments"".The first 30 minutes were very good, but afterwards the movie deteriorated. The scenes of the plagues were not properly directed, with the special effects being overdone and appearing amateurish (again, compare to DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments""). The Red Sea scenes were likewise rather unimpressive.Ridley Scott has done some great work in the past (such as in ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Gladiator"") but ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is not one of his better movies.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

139,C22Man,"Visually stunning, Emotionally shallow",3,19 June 2015,"When you hear that Ridley Scott is doing a retelling of the famous Moses story with Christian Bale in the lead role you already expect something special. But that is the main problem with the film. You expect something great because of those involved and instead what we get is another version of the Moses story that, though visually stunning, adds nothing new to the tale. Reviews have been pretty poor overall, but this isn't a bad film by any means. It's just a boring one and for many people that's probably a worse offence. Scott is so concerned with creating an 'epic' which looks spectacular that he completely does away with any decent character development and just repeats the story we have heard many times over with very few variations.So are there any differences to the famous tale? Well there are a few, but they aren't carried off that well. The Moses presented here is a much tougher one to begin with as we see him engaging in swordplay and making sure his commands are carried out. Moses is then informed that he is in fact Hebrew and after some reluctance believes this to be true. The problem here is how rushed it all is, Moses goes from being told he's Hebrew to accepting his heritage to being exiled in ten minutes and there is not enough time for these parts of the plot to be developed. I've never liked the whole Moses being away for nine years part and I don't like it here either. It gives us no insight into his character and you're just left wondering what he's been doing every day for this long, why does one vision after a bang on the head make him want to return? It's laid on thin ground.It was an interesting idea to have God represented as a child and in theory sounds like a smart idea, yet I don't think it is put to full use. The dialogue in those scenes is clunky and the child actor isn't convincing in the role. As I've acknowledged, the pacing throughout the film was off. At times it felt like it was rushing through key parts of the story and at others it felt as if it was dragging a straightforward scene out just for the sake of it. If Scott wanted to do a lengthy epic then that's fine but the right balance has to be found and it never is.Christian Bale was very unmemorable as Moses. Bale's problem is that he seemed to love playing Batman so much that he brings that to most of his films since then. His Moses flip-flops from calm and caring to angry and intense, like the film he never manages the right balance. I also have big problems with his accent in that it keeps changing , at one point he sounded Cockney and that only distracts from the character further. Joel Edgerton was miscast as Rameses, he looks too much like a thug to be convincing as the pharaoh. This Rameses doesn't have much to do either because he starts off as an arrogant crank and just gets madder as the film goes on. In fairness Edgerton does grow into the vengeful aspects as things move along, but he does nothing else with the character.This leads to another issue, the characters are all one dimensional and aren't developed. Moses is conflicted and stays that way despite God's guidance, Rameses is narrow-minded and remains like that, and even Ben Mendelsohn is wasted as he gets nothing to do as the stereotypically slimy Hegep. None of these characters change and they aren't all that interesting to begin with. A solid supporting cast in Ben Kingsley, Aaron Paul and John Turturro are given nothing to do with very boring side characters who are demoted to the background. The film can be as big as it wants, but if the characters are dull then it harms everything else.Elsewhere the score from Alberto Iglesias could have added a lot to the film but in the end it sounds too generic. I'd be hard pressed to remember the main arrangement and for the most part it has that middle-eastern flavour that too many films use once there is a shot of the desert. The action was also quite underwhelming, most of it was just a gritty swords and sandals affair with some blood shown for effect. The parting of the Red Sea suggested that some big encounter was going to take place and it never does which is fine, but why propose it in the first place.So was there anything good? Well there were many good things, but all on a superficial level. The film does look absolutely stunning and Ridley Scott shows once again that he is a master at getting amazing visuals. The cities look fantastic, the desert villages look appropriate, the sets are all very well constructed and all of the CGI blends in seamlessly. Scott's directing is still impressive, he knows how to get shots that generate atmosphere and he does this on a frequent basis. The parts featuring the plague are done brilliantly and are probably the highlights of the film, with a real ominous tension hanging over everything.So this is a retelling of the Moses story that is all surface and has little underneath. The two key elements of the tale are its plot and its characters, which are both underdeveloped and not engaging enough. There is no faulting Scott's eye for a good shot and it is visually epic in the best sense. Yet it does nothing interesting with the story, nothing is done with the side characters and the two leads both fall flat. It all ends up feeling like a pointless experience when it really could, and should, have been so much more than that.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
140,lois-lane33,Blah Blah Blah.,5,4 May 2015,I have some relatives in the UK called Scott that I wish I was not related to. Why? They are the type of people that if you travel 3000 miles and happen to be in their area and knock on their door-open their door and then act rudely. Whenever I see that director Ridley Scott has made a new movie I think of my stupid relatives called Scott in the UK. Perhaps I am being too cold-but I think its really that bad-this film for example is a dramatization of the story of Moses from the Bible. Personally I don't think Bible stores are very interesting-never mind big screen adaptations of them. Never mind that they went out of style after Ben Hur. Ridley-or rather- Sir Ridley Scott came into the public eye after utilizing the artwork of Swiss artist HR Giger for the 1979 film Alien & then utilizing Syd Meade-another artist-as the visual driving force- behind the 1982 blockbuster Bladerunner. The rest they say is history-but those films only worked because of good ARTISTS supporting the films. The director was acting as a catalyst. I saw Exodus Gods and Kings free online. I would not have paid to see it. Its a great movie if you don't mind seeing something totally irrelevant. I think there are messages being sent by many of Ridley's movies but I disagree with a lot of those messages-American Gangster was like suggesting ordinary families are often involved with crime-in North America-even if they are not 'crime families.' It's the exception to the rule: not the rule. Even 1979's Alien was basically just saying Aliens are probably just monsters. Deep stuff. Thats no further forward than The Creature from the Black Lagoon. I suppose it irritates me to see someone who basically doesn't really have anything to say being given such a huge soapbox to say it on.,Exodus - Gods and Kings

143,FilmMuscle,An Epically Bloated Spectacle,5,14 December 2014,"Biblical epics seem to be making a promisingly grandiose comeback, helmed by respected filmmakers like Darren Aronofsky and Ridley Scott. Well, as for the latter, it's quite heartbreaking to witness the downward spiral of a man who once graced us with one of the greatest, if not the greatest—most perfect, epics in Gladiator. Scott's famed production values surely haven't deteriorated since then, but his creative vision certainly has. Exodus: Gods and Kings retells the classic biblical story about the ferocious rivalry between two regal ""brothers"": Moses (Christian Bale) and Ramses (Joel Edgerton). They grow up together under the wing of Egypt's pharaoh, Sati I (John Turturro)—their support and love for one another never defied until their differences on the state of Egyptian slavery materializes and their dutiful father passes away for Ramses to take the throne. On completely opposite moral ends of the spectrum, Moses accepts his destiny as God's prophet to aid the people while Ramses only worsens the citizens' situation—in their poverty and captivity—during his mercilessly tyrannical reign. To most audiences, this tale is already very well familiar, not just for those who have read the religious text but also for those who witnessed the narrative unfold on the big screen before through classics like The Ten Commandments and The Prince of Egypt. Yes—first and foremost—Exodus' production design and sheer visual splendor is simply impeccable. Like with Gladiator, Scott seems to have built an entire kingdom, permeated with astonishingly imposing ornate structures and gaudy decorations. It took me back to the first time I saw Ben- Hur's jaw-dropping, larger-than-life sets and reminded me of this particular genre's current drought in the industry. Still, nothing you see in the first hour and a half of Exodus remotely compares to the wildly entertaining segment that bedevils Egypt with the infamous ten plagues. It's not every day we see a studio film with the disturbing imagery of dead children; Exodus dares to be that uncompromising in its few thrilling moments.On the other hand, those occasional scenes are interrupted by painfully lengthy stretches of walking and then some more walking. At 150 minutes long, the film is overly bloated, smugly comfortable in its every minute (or just unnecessary) story arc and overly reliant on its spectacle to entertain the crowd throughout its never-ending duration. The exciting specialty of Homeric battle sequences is utterly diluted herein; the amount of executions and monumental clashes is innumerable to the point of forgetfulness. The finale's runtime extends far beyond necessity and eventually strikes you with boredom. Now, we can question the correlation between a truly boring story and one's attention span; frankly, I hate that entire (condescending) argument because it's purely subjective to the eye and mind. If I were to assume that mentality, a moment of hypocrisy would soon follow. For instance, I honestly found Transformers: Age of Extinction and The Expendables 3 to be incredibly soporific while finding myself totally riveted by a slow-paced European film like Force Majeure. Actually, the first half of this picture appeared wholly by-the-numbers and fairly predictable in its direction without any unique events to justify this modern remake. The premise and story are spectacularly compelling indeed, but the execution is acutely poor (again, the pace and uninteresting Hollywood tropes stand out). ""Let's waste a considerable portion of the movie on a romance that's, funnily enough, unconvincingly rushed in its first stage and seriously dragged out post-marriage."" So, the plot of the film isn't handled exceptionally well, but does Exodus at least offer something thought-provoking— something profound to say about religion or societal traditions? There's a clear opportunity for that sort of material, but it's either incoherent or downright nonexistent. The ambiguity in interpreting one's (religious) faith/god—intriguingly presented in Noah— is largely absent in this biblical entry. There are hints of an insane man rambling within Moses (seeing a messy-haired, heavily bearded, and gritty personage in the climax, for one), but it doesn't go anywhere from there. With Bale's recent comments on Moses' frightening mania, I was expecting something more of a new, nuanced rendition of the character—again, something like what Aronofsky pulled off with a renowned character like Noah and put quite a topical, stimulating spin on it all. In addition, yes, the level of whitewashing here is utterly transparent (with the striking presence of Sigourney Weaver as an Egyptian particularly laughable), but I'm not going to pretend like the performances didn't make up for it. It's up to the Hollywood system to birth more colored actors/stars in order for the future ridiculously expensive blockbuster to cast them. In short, this might be too profound and controversial of a topic to sufficiently cover in a film review, but there's yet a silver lining in all this: Christian Bale's and Joel Edgerton's performances are definitely notable as usual. Ben Mendelsohn and Ben Kingsley also make disappointingly brief, but absolutely memorable, appearances while Aaron Paul's talent is completely wasted.In its closing, the end result that came of Exodus: Gods and Kings frustrates me because I really desired to like this film more—in this day and age, it's undoubtedly an ambitious task to produce a film of this scope. There are only several filmmakers that Hollywood entrusts with this kind of mountainous project, and unfortunately, it fell into the hands of Ridley Scott—a director whose peak is far behind him.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
144,tinovalkki,Too long and too Biblical,5,3 January 2015,"Many movie, which is based on Biblical stories are doomed to fail. Earlier this year Noah was great disappointment and now even Exodus won't make big surprise. In these days you should have more courage to abandon Bible and dare to handle the story more earthly. It is just plane stupid to bring burning and talking bushes to big big screen, because that is not what the people want to see. You need to have dare to take story out of big book and mode it more dramatically. Make it more historical spectacle than Biblical story. Exodus works quite well when director tells action and drama, but feels quite embarrassed when it talks to God who seem to appear as a kid. Set is beautiful and 3D works quite well, especially on aerial shooting. Christian Bale manage his role as Moses when story is telling historical drama. But as a Biblical Moses he won't convince well. As a historical spectacle movie works quite well, but as a Biblical story it feels quite discomfort. Now the movie is just a average historical movie, but if Ridely Scott ever makes a Director's cut, I just hope he cut it half an hour shorter and takes out all indication to Bible. That's the Exodus I want to see.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
145,douglasmcbroom,Led Out Of Bondage,6,3 October 2021,"Director Ridley Scott knows how to make an epic. He knows how to stage gigantic set-pieces and battle scenes. This film cost $140M and every bit of it is on the screen as glorious eye candy. It is an incredible mix mastery of CGI and location shooting. It's long, but it does not drag.Why then did I only give this film a 6 rating? Horrible casting! The lead actors, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton, as Moses and Ramses, are both fine actors, but they are roughly half the age of the characters they are playing. Until, mysteriously, at the very end of the film, Moses miraculously ages 50 years. And the accents? My God, they are all over the place. Bale's is kind of British-sometimes. Edgerton's is a muddled mush with the odd Australian creeping in. Sigourney Weaver's is jarringly American. American John Turturro is doing a British accent. Ben Mendelson plays Viceroy Hegep as a impish British Gay doing pantomime. Ewan Bremmer gives us a Scottish brogue. I have no idea why Aaron Paul is in the film, as he grunts and utters only a couple of dozens words until his scene on the beach with Moses, when he gives us a few words in what sounds like Irish Cockney.I would have cast Anthony Hopkins, as Moses, and Ben Kingsley, as Ramses. Kingsley is the stand-out actor in the film in the far too-limited role of Nun. The screenplay suffered from too many cooks. Just as 4 cooks cannot make a stew, nor can 4 writers collaborate on a screenplay.

It just didn't work for me.When the plagues start to take over, I think it relied a little to much on CGI. And obviously how else can you make a billion frogs and a billion flies.

147,rjsf96,The Biblical Equivalent of 'The Lone Ranger',3,21 January 2015,"'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is the type of movie that if you pay little attention to what unfolds on screen then you may fool yourself into thinking that you had a good time. Unfortunately, this is not it. Not even a guilty pleasure and that's what is sad about it, this movie had potential. A great Actor and Director behind it, what more can you ask for? A substantial amount it would seem after viewing this heap of dung.It does still have its good points, they are just too few and too far between to satisfy. Take Christian Bale, he demands our attention from the onset and holds it – he gives us what we crave above all else, charisma. It's only fitting then that Moses' brother Ramses, his bipolar opposite, acts in a contrasting manner, badly and unfathomably ridiculously, it becomes clear that Joel Edgerton was miscast. Whenever he dons the Egyptian head wear I had a chuckle. The thing is we are supposed to take the film seriously and I cannot for the life of me.What baffles me most is that although the film is based from Biblical events it comes across as a complete rip-off of Ridley Scott's other considerably greater epic, 'Gladiator', and that film excels. They both feature virtually the same key plot points; they have an outcast from society whom is banished, a brother for a rival who oppresses the people, a family who love the protagonist dearly, and the hero must regain their former glory. 'Gladiator' was always entertaining and never become stupid or even unwatchable.Seriously, what happened to our beloved Scott, who brought us classics like 'Alien'? I truly fear that he has become lost and self-absorbed by his own ego. Much like the fantasy filmmaker Peter Jackson. I guess that it is because Scott is the Director of 'Exodus' (and unnecessarily long title) that it still has technical merit. As the film in fact looks astounding. Scott has not lost his visual flair but his eye for absorbing scripts.The fact is that there is too much familiar on offer here. Even the action scenes drag like the whole sorry affair. It's just we have seen them done better before and it always boils down to one key ingredient. This is character development and has held back populist filmmakers like Michael Bay ever since he first pressed record. If I am not given a sufficient reason to care about our hero in peril, then I will just observe the film from afar, never truly interacting, just gazing in dumbfounded disbelief. The relationship between the two brothers should be the centre and emotional core of the film. Yet it is neglected, I never felt that the brothers bonded and therefore I could not care less when they became enemies.The runtime also stabs this film in the heart and covers the already gaping wounds with handfuls of salt. There is no forward momentum. 'Ben-Hur' was an epic with depth and that came to a monstrous 225 minutes. Exodus runs for seventy five less, but feels in excess of four hours. That's when you realise something went fatally wrong.There is one point which particularly irritated me, but will anger Christians even more, the handling of God. He is portrayed by a young actor who sounds as if he is giving a stilted rehearsal from cue cards for a lesser tier soap opera. I could not stand him and when he continued to crop up, I could take no more. Scott's drivel had driven me to the edge. Enough was enough.Once we arrive at the plague section of the film, ninety minutes in, we are exhausted and although the sequence itself does entertain, it is too little too late. It becomes clear that Scott has been deluded throughout the entirety of the production and it will take some doing for the film faithful to forgive.'Exodus' (The never-ending epic) begs comparison from Scott's previous formidable body of work and it blunders in, unawares that the audience wants its money back after the first hour. We are given the equivalent of 'The Lone Ranger', which is to say; ham-fisted, dumb, never ending, dull and fatally without characters who contain an ounce of depth. Scott come back to the light, you have become truly lost.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
148,MattBirk,Exodus: Exit Now,4,14 December 2014,"Unfortunately Ridley Scott continues his streak of disappointing movies with Exodus: Gods and Kings. The movie is just plain boring for the vast majority of the film, even with an all-star cast, the movie just doesn't shine. Where as Noah had an abundance of style in it (thanks to the brilliant Aronofsky), Exodus seemed to be lacking on the stylish flair (which it definitely needed). The story of Moses is epic, but the portrayal of that story in the movie didn't do it any sort of justice, it was long and tedious. The movie offers nothing new to the story of Moses, the emotional level in the film was not as strong as it should have been. The actors were a huge drawback for the film unfortunately, too many high profile characters made the movie feel more 'fake' than it should have, it would have been more beneficial to hirer less known actors. Another very odd feature in the film was it's dialogue, it had a way too modern feeling to it, I noticed that almost immediately. One might not think this is a huge deal, but it's very noticeable and again, makes the movie seem less biblical in a sense. In the end, I would definitely say Noah is the better film of the two (the two biblical epics of 2014), it's not as grand a story as Moses, but the amount of style in the film pushes it ahead of Exodus.

A wise old sage once told me that if you can't tell the story right, don't tell it all. There is only one story as it is told in the Bible Chapter Exodus and that is the story. The way it is told in this movie about Moses, it ain't the way it was written. It is a mockery of the original story It is pure blasphemy and nothing but an attack on the Bible and religion. No right thinking Jew or Christian should watch this movie. It is obvious that its producers do not understand in the least the spiritual message the story the Bible tells.For example, where ""a snarky, querulous 13 year old boy"" becomes the voice of God rather than ""an unseen voice in the clouds."" This shows the producer's lack of understanding of the Scripture. Moses was praying in a very humble and unselfish way for guidance from God and his prayer was answered. When God answers our prayers, the answer comes out of nowhere and the clouds simply were a metaphorical way of stating that. Anyone that has had that experience knows this but obviously the producers of the movie have not, so not believing in that that God's voice could come out of nowhere, they substitute a boy.Not only that, the movie adds to the story and in so doing becomes quite silly at times and that is another reason not to watch the movie because it is just another effort to undermine and distort the story of the exodus.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
150,Rawal_Afzal,A film that can be fully enjoyed by sidelining the religious angle of things and also how the narratives in the religious scriptures go,9,4 June 2015,"I watch this film back then when it was released, so I am writing a review a few months after. Let me highlight the controversial and the objectionable stuff:The overall plot and the story is based on Moses and the Pharaoh, but the details of the events differ a great, great deal from what the Bible states. A lot of Biblical inaccuracies and contradiction are there, the most noticeable of which is the absolute non- existence of the miracles performed by Moses. I think these are the main reason behind the not-so-great reviews, and I can understand a lot of believing Christians and Jews being disturbed by it. 30 minutes into the film, you can at least tell what not to expect: the conformity of the Bible narratives and the miracles.Regarding the miracles, it was quite clear what the film-makers were trying so hard to do: he tried his level best to bring down the miracles to the extent of them making sense to the human thinking and tried to be logical. An example being how the blood-in-the-sea miracle was credited to the crocodiles and their pure madness. Irrespective of how successful it was, I am not too dismissive of the idea and instead commend the film-makers for such a unique attempt and approach to miracles, all though there's room to argue that the miracles themselves formed a great part of the whole legend. There's not much justification for the other inaccuracies though. So that should have been kept in its original form.I must add here though that it's a lot easier for me to take a rational approach, sidelining the beliefs, being neither a Jew nor a Christian. So I can fully understand the negative reactions by those whose beliefs have been compromised. One thing that I still found to be offensive at a personal level was, God was shown as very cruel and blood-thirsty, referring particularly to him killing all the children of the Egyptians. God being referred to as a ""fanatic"" by the Pharaoh of all the people looked very odd.However, there's another aspect to look at it from. Treat it as a film, just creative work of fiction without keeping anything in mind of how the narratives in the religions are, I would then give it nine out of 10. A great film I thought! I loved it! Having watched it in 3D, this was something that I will never forget. There was something about it, definitely!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
151,vistheindian,Exodus: Gods and Kings – Special FX and boredom,6,27 December 2014,"Quickie Review:Moses, a born leader must fight the Egyptian Pharoah Ramses, who he once called brother. With the help of God, Moses unites his people, the Hebrew slaves, to fight for their freedom and in the search for liberation the people endure the deadly plagues. Although Ridley Scott has been known to make incredible movies, his reputation has faltered in recent years due to some mediocre to poor films. Exodus should have been a reminder of Scott's capabilities, but instead he delivers yet another mediocre movie with a lot of visual spectacle and little emotional impact. Even the actors feel underused because too much time is spent on Moses alone rather than building his relations with other characters. In the end, I'd only recommend this for the plague scenes and the finale, everything else will force you to check your watch multiple times.Full Review:I'm no expert on biblical stories but I do know the movie The Ten Commandments from 1956, and how it left people in awe with its special effects. Now that we are near the end of year 2014 (Happy New Year to those reading this in 2015) visuals are no longer a challenge. So I knew I'd be satisfied in that department. What concerned me was how the story telling was going to be, because that's where director Ridley Scott has been questionable the past few years.First off if you are concerned that famous American and British actors in Ancient Egyptian costumes would come off looking silly, you need not worry. To be realistic, this movie is catered for the worldwide audience and for that you need recognizable yet talented actors, and there are plenty of that in Exodus. Most notable performance is Christian Bale as Moses. His character could easily have been played as an all-powerful prophet making him completely unrelatable. Instead Bale effectively shows his inner conflicts and doubts especially during the plagues, whether the end justifies the means. Admit it, if he was completely unfazed by thousands of people suffering and dying from the plagues he'd be a major jerk. On top of the acting, the scale and detail added to the setting of Ancient Egypt is impressive. The cities and lives of the slaves are well realized, so you are completely immersed into that world. The CGI during the plague scenes felt real and disturbing, which of course added to the immersion.Even with the positives there are several problems with the movie that prevent it from being an enjoyable experience as a whole. There were some odd pacing issues; a rushed introduction, a dragging middle, then a rushed climax and end. It felt as if the introduction only served to showcase visuals of Ancient Egypt. Not much time is spent on the relationship between Ramses and Moses, which should have been the emotional crutch of the entire film. So there goes the opportunity to add any depth. As for the middle, the story comes to a crawl concentrating only on Moses and his wife. To make matters worse we don't see her again for the last 1hr of the movie, so the time spent on building their marital relationship was completely useless. Then the filmmakers must have realized they had some budget left, so they through it all on the visuals for the climax rather than concentrate on the storytelling.Basically, Exodus: Gods and Kings is a case of story serving the spectacle instead of spectacle serving the story. There were misplaced priorities by the filmmakers when developing Exodus. Christian Bale may have a redeemable quality but it's not reason enough to see it in cinemas. If you want, it is certainly stream or rental worthy.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Exodus - Gods and Kings

And yet, three bong tokes in, I can't take my eyes off of it. The special effects are amazing. And Christian Bale buried up to his crusty beard in mud as he pontificates with the god-child? Priceless. And everyone in this movie, it appears, has access to a dentist specializing in teeth whitening. And everyone, it seems, is blue eyed and White—especially John Turturro, who we intuitively realize is laughing his ass of in his trailer after every contrived and rigid take. There is no soul here, no passion, no vestiges of Alien or Gladiator. No, only Prometheus remains, this time in the form of ancient Egypt.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
153,Barev2013,THE BIG RED SEA TSUNAMI Lots of nice landscapes but little character,5,30 January 2015,"EXODUS. GODS AND KINKS By Alex Deleon, January 28 in Paris. Finally caught up with Ridley's version of The Ten Commandments at the magnificent viewing facilities of the MK2 Bibliothèque cineplex in Paris -- Well, at least we got that one Out of the Way, or as sagacious Armenian colleague. HAGOP Bedoian in L.A. would say: DEGHEN ELAV! To start with, the questionable casting -- Christian Bale as Moses is No Charleton Heston and was far more believable as a bloated con artist in ""American Hustle"". Aussie actor Joel Edgerton is somewhat more acceptable as Pharaoh but is forced to utter ridiculously anachronistic dialogue like ""economically unfeasible"" ~ Ben Kingsley as Noun, father of Jonathan, looks like he was cloned out of Schindler's List, John Turturro and Sigourney Weaver, are both unrecognizable in this makeup masquerade, and, above all -- my main reason for sitting through this film -- was to catch sight of great Iranian top star in exile, Golshifte Farahani -- in her second Ridley Scott casting -- but I must have blinked or dosed somewhere along the line because I missed her -- or didn't recognize her in her Exodus rigging.DIVINE KINKINESSThe other important character is of course GOD ~ who lapses onto the scene before a bush vaguely burning in the background (one of the few concessions to the actual Biblical tale!) -- in the form of a sassy wise-ass blond blue-eyed Anglo Saxon boy of ten (estimated age) who prompts a dazed and feckless Moses, up to his ears in mud, into action -- kinky to say the least -- followed by dazzling Plague administration -- voracious Crocodiles churn the river Red with Egyptian boats men's blood -- as a storm of locusts hits town BIGTIME --leading up to the Let My People Go-Go Grande Finale-- Which segues to a National Geographic Low Tide allowing the scampering ragged Hebrews and their flocks to make it across the Red Sea to safety with Pharaoh's remaining charioteers in hot pursuit -- Half of them croaked when the narrow mountain road under their spinning wheels collapsed -- (cheers from Audience) -- But when they hit the shore and enter the shallows they are swallowed up my a massive Tsunami of Fukushima proportions -- as cyclones waver menacingly in the air -- presumably sent by the Hebrew God -- and Moses himself nearly drowns --glub-glub. Dénouement: Moses goes and finds his beautiful Bedouin wife, whom he hastily married but temporarily abandoned ten years before in the line of Duty -- but Waitaminnit! -- maybe THAT was the shifty Golshifte I was looking for, although this was not confirmed in the final credits. If Golshifte is ever going to make it Big in Hollywood -- as she certainly deserves to -- she'll have to sign up for some meteor roles than this.Much of the picture was shot in Morocco and accordingly was all set for release there in December -- but was pulled at the last minute because some ortho-fanatic on the Casablanca Censorship board felt that any representation of GOD ( the One they call ""Allah"") in human form -- even if he's only a kid -- was BLASPHEMY -- and we all now know what that means .... However, after excising the offensive God scenes the picture is now out in Morocco -- but probably not in other Islamic countries where Egyptians talking with British accents is probably also considered to be blasphemous.

154,ahegde3149,Tedious and bland CGI-fest,3,2 July 2015,"Director Ridley Scott has lost his touch. Among his recent works only Prometheus was appreciable. With Exodus: Gods and Kings he offers nothing more than monotonous uninteresting characters void of any passion plus a poor script which doesn't do any justice to the epicness of the tale being told. Only thing appreciable is the eye-candy visuals and the high profile cast. The plagues loaded with CGI were done quite nicely. Actually the cast with names like Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Aaron Paul ,etc all are wasted with characters which pop- up once in 30 minutes just to show they are in the film. The character development is poor and characters themselves pretty much one-dimensional. Christian Bale tries his best to bring something out of the paper-thin Moses but it doesn't work. After the stern monotonic ""I am"" child god I completely lost my faith. All we have is flat story telling lacking interest. The 2 and half hour run time is an abomination and makes it utterly tiring experience. By the time it reach the last wave-sequence I just didn't care about anything happening. RATING: [1.5/5]",Exodus - Gods and Kings
155,winak,Exodus from the Reality,4,8 January 2015,"This movie does not hold a candle to the Cecil De Mille's 1956 epic ""The Ten Commandments"". To ensure I know what I am talking about I fished out the DVD of the Ten Commandments and watched it again. Yes, sure ""Exodus"" has the special effects, 3D graphics & sound but it does not have the soul or authenticity that made the older version an all-time classic. Ridley Scott is overly zealous in showcasing the technological advancements instead of focusing on the message of the movie. Mr. Scott borrows this story from the holy books, but shamelessly attempts to be secular in representing the story. There are lots of historical & biblical inaccuracies, bordering blasphemy. Here are some of the discrepancies. Moses slay-ed a slave master when he saw him beating upon a fellow Jew; In the movie they show Moses striking down two sentries when he emerged from a house. The biblical staff of Moses which changes in to a serpent at the Pharaoh's court, parts the Red sea & strikes the rock to bring forth water in the desert is conspicuously missing from the movie. There is no Pillar of cloud barring the path of the pursuing Egyptians nor a Wall of water rising from the parting of the Red sea. God is portrayed as a child, when there is no such reference in any of the holy books. In fact, Exodus 33:20 in the Bible says ""You Cannot see My face, for no man shall see Me, and live"". Exodus 31:18 states that the Commandments was written by the finger of God, while the movie shows Moses chiseling the commandments himself. The Plagues are quickly done with as a formality without dwelling on their significance, as if it were mere anomalies of nature instead of an Act of God. Most unconvincing is the characterization of Moses who is portrayed as a rebellious warrior instead of a prophet. He has no adhering characteristics that make him stand out as God's chosen messenger. He's depicted as a whiny, constantly dissenting individual, unlike the real Moses from the scriptures.In short, Mr. Scott tries to put a spin on a story from the holy scriptures just to pander to commercialism so I'll say this, Creativity should never tamper with facts. If Mr. Scott wishes to embellish, he should reserve his talents for his action adventure flicks",Exodus - Gods and Kings
156,clarkmick33,This movie is not the Biblical Exodus - it is Hollywood Exodus.,5,22 March 2015,"I just had to write a review of this movie. As a Christian I feel deeply offended by the way God was displayed in the movie. Displaying God as some sort of weird east Asian child monk. They seriously look like they just recycled the character from the movie ""THe Last Airbender"". In no way is God EVER mentioned as a child. The movie also portrays ""God"" as some sort of pathetic angry little child. Ridley Scott should stick to making Hollywood blockbusters instead of watering down powerful biblical stories. I hope no one expects to learn any actual historical facts from this movie.This movie is just a big bloated Hollywood popcorn blockbuster. The acting was empty, forced and unemotional. The European accents of some of the actors just took me right out of the setting of Ancient Egypt - you get, British, American, Irish, Scottish and Eastern European accents. I feel as though I was looking at some weird alternate historical reality where ancient English had been captured and enslaved by ancient Egyptians.As a blockbuster that has nothing to do with the Bible the visual special effects were top notch, many details of ancient life were displayed very well. But as we know from Michael Bay films no matter how well you do CGI its ultimately a great inspiring story that people want to see.Ultimately I think this movie is an insult to Christians, Jews, Egyptians and anyone who has read the Bible.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
157,filmtravel101,Scientific Moses and terrible script a waste of money,1,17 December 2014,"It is hard to imagine that Ridley Scott would make this type of film to begin with plus one of the worst scripts and horrendous dialogue imaginable. It makes Noah look like a good movie where at least Russell Crowe's character of Noah has some conviction and decent dialogue that made you realize he was a lunatic obsessed by his mission. Moses exodus story is based on Ridley Scott's secular scientific, and a slew of British actors rendition that is so blatantly blase and vanilla bland that you almost laugh throughout the movie wondering what Ridley and his writers were smoking when they wrote it. As a comedy it would be wonderfully farcical but unfortunately it is a 140 million dollar budget movie - that makes no sense, and the actors dialogue is almost all meaningless except the main character of Moses who never gives any impression of feeling like he is a Hebrew - or that he is performing anything worthwhile or a prophet. I will not even go into God being a spoiled argumentative brat that seems almost straight out of a Monty Python/Exorcist bad rendition.There are so many holes in this story that surely others can blast it forever, but the best ones are: Moses not only uses his golden sword to be thrown in an Excaliber like style into the Red Sea as his last resort to find a solution..and voila... a tsunami starts to happen....and just after his followers don't believe him and once again debate if it is a good idea to follow this mad man, since he never refers to them as his tribe or people that really believe in him as a leader or profit. Yet the best part is, after getting pummeled by a massive 150 foot tsunami wave...he miraculously survives and nobody comes up to congratulate him in his distressed, bloodied ripped open body condition - but instead...he brushes it off like no big deal..just another day surfing some killer waves dudes, and Ramses also survives with his 50 pound golden necklace still attached. And to make matters even more funny... he tells his brother .. oh by the way.. i have a wife and a kid.. you think its cool they come along for our 40 year trek across the middle east to the promised land? His brother replies. You're married? It is so funny.. making one realize that they have not talked at all or had any connection during the super long walk aka Exodus from Egypt to the Red Sea.. they never once talked about anything and are total strangers. Ridley and his writers surely smoked some good weed to write this garbage that is just so pathetic you truly wonder what made them make this script get approved.. unless maybe.. just maybe there is 2 hours missing on the cutting floor.Too many spoilers to mention besides the total lack of dialogue of any meaning for any of the poor foolish actors that signed up for this hogwash film.. which is even more ruined by a wide array of British blue eyed actors...who make more of a farce of being Egyptians. Not sure where Ridley got the memo that Egyptians have blue eyes yet and all happen to also have British accents.. i mean at least try to hire someone that looks slightly Egyptian... and Paul Aaron with a smeared on self tanner looks so laughable that it is hard to take him serious as Ramses senior adviser. At least John Turturo looked the part but acted like an effeminate moron throughout the film but had more lines than almost any other character.. and poor Joel Edgerton was given no meaningful lines and just looked pathetic..sitting next to his son.. with no servants, maids, or concubines.. and given.. Ramses had over 100 kids.. but no.. he is a dad sitting alone at night watching over his son..truly hysterical, and i will not go into how lame Ridley and his writers make the Egyptian society and their beliefs seem like ignorant fools. And he dares to use some scientific explanation of the plagues as if Ramses advisors at that time had any clue of scientific deductive reasoning for a society that worshiped every animal and astrological symbol and the after life. Anyways, you sort of get the general gist that Ridley was given a huge paycheck and tossed a terrible concept probably by some Hollywood exec that loves bible stories around the same time Noah was being made, so it makes sense he would take the money and laugh to the bank. Pathetic story and sad to see him make such a terrible film with no meaning or heart to it.. just another Hollywood special effect empty film. 1 star.. mostly accolades to Christian bale and the DP and CG team.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

I would have added this movie to my collection, but it is called the *parting* of the Red Sea, not the ""refilling"" of the Red Sea. How do you mess that up???? They had the special effects budget to create the parting, and it would've been a great movie. But noooooo, they had to completely fictionalize that scene.

159,moviescoundrel,A ROYAL Disappointment,6,16 December 2014,"The review: Difficult to believe but certainly possible apparently. Scott apparently has taken certain liberties and translations that were clearly not evident in the Bible. In the Biblical story, Moses goes to The Pharoah multiple times to give him an opportunity to release the slaves. The Pharoah says ""no thank you"" and then Moses attempts to convince The Pharoah by showing him some miracle of God. In this version, there is not as much convincing. Moses (Bale) goes to the Pharoah (Edgerton) puts a sword to his throat and says release the slaves. This does not happen, but instead of multiple chances and great lines exchanged by these actors, we get nothing. The events just happen. Moses gets his wisdom not from a bush but from a boy that is only visible to him. He doesn't seem to ever be too convinced of his faith but he does listen to the boy for the most part. The events happen, and they don't happen as they did in the Bible so much. The water turns to blood, but it is caused by thousands of hungry crocodile that eat everyone in the water and every living thing in the water and this makes blood. Then there are flies, and disease, and many of the other plagues. Just not a lot of conversation and relevant dialogue in between. It's like there was a budget for special effects but they ran out of time to film the scenes between the main actors, and the result is a mish mashed series of events that don't feel important, poignant, or accurate. I feel there was so much potential left on the floor here, and it just doesn't make sense. There are some artistic liberties and expressions that are possible to take in some areas of the Bible that maybe are not LITERALLY EVIDENT...and those events and things would be interesting to see fleshed out according to Scott's vision. Most of the events here though, not so much.The effects were pretty to watch. The crocodiles, locusts, etc. were entertaining to watch and done well, I just didn't care as much due to the way the story was executed. Bad form.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
160,DogFilmCritic,Mr. Scott what is wrong with you,4,10 March 2015,"This movie was a train wreck even before it was in theaters since I saw the posters I knew this was going to be bad, a sword wielding Moses with armor my jaw drop as I saw it I thought they wanted to make Moses in to Braveheart were was the sense in that but it gets worst once I saw the trailer I knew this was going to be pathetic, so even after the two warnings I got my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to see how one of the greatest directors of all time the man that gave us Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, American Gangster would mess up is such a way that you couldn't tell he actually knew how to tell a story right, the only good thing I will say about this movie is how beautiful the stets and the effects look( I didn't see it in 3D but I was told the effects were awful) that's all I thought A good year was Ridley Scotts worst movie I was so wrong it hurts even more knowing this wasn't a poor made movie a lot of time went in the production of this movie but non to interpretation of the actual story.The acting in this movie is just awful specially from the two main actors Bale and Edgerton, there are a lot of talented supporting actors in this movie that are completely wasted Ben Kingsley John Turturro , Sigourney Weaver she has one scene in this whole movie and it was better that what Chistian Bale brought as Moses, Bale a man known to go the extra mile every time he steps in a role but in this one he is so dull and his character at times is so emotionless to his surroundings, there are parts in this movie that make him a complete jerk as some of his actions (that are completely out of the actual story) causes the lives of Hebrew family's as in this version of the story he is more of a general that a prophet I'm not kidding God in this movie actually says to Moses I need a general he doesn't use his staff at all I mean he has one but he only carries it in a few scenes the Moses in this film uses a sword his a warrior , yeah I remember how in the bible God recruited Peter and Paul to be his hired assassinright, this idea of Moses being a warlord is ridiculous, Moses himself wrote the exodus in the story he dose kill an Egyptian for brutally whipping a slave and that's it in the movie he goes killing any Egyptian he encounters it feels like he wanted to be remember as an action hero ,Moses recruits Hebrews in the art of archery for no good reason sure they burn some boats but that's it after that God says I will do my business, I'm not kidding that is his exact words he sounds like a mob boss at this point.The antagonist Ramses (Joel Edgerton) he feels so out of place, he would over act in some parts and in others he would lack the emotion for the scene still he is a better character that Moses, Ramses feels like a real person torn with the love of his brother and the rebellion he has to face, he becomes mad with power but at least his trying to act like a human, his not this one dimensional character that focus on exterminating the Hebrews he genuinely cares for his people.I'm not a religious person, I do believe in God as a kid I loved learning the story of the exodus and how God chose Moses to do his miracles, when I saw how God was interpret it was horrendous not his physical appearance but how he talks to Moses it's a semi-stable relationship, Moses disagrees with God and In the movie I could see why God kills more people than the Egyptians even the blood plague affects the Hebrews by the way the reason how the blood plague comes to play its just absurd you have to see it of yourself , worst of all when they see Moses talking to God he is seen as a crazy person talking to himself rather than a chosen prophet, and that's the main problem nothing in this film feels epic as it should, you see all the biblical movies and you get a sense of a larger than life events but recent biblical movies chose to go in a different path making there protagonist a bit dark such in the case of Noah (2014) if you saw both movies it feels like they were done the same way both take to long for something to happened and the rest of the story is really bored. When they get to the red sea you see it in the trailer and you keep guessing how exactly is going to work out, there are a lot of good effects if you're really attached to horse's you probably wouldn't like this scene actually in many parts of the movie horses get the worst. As Ramses approaches the Hebrews they make it look like it's going to be a fight scene in the middle of the red sea. In the end if you're looking for an inaccurate historical/biblical movie this one is for you, not recommended for any religious person it's a pass, looking at this film with a religious perspective you probably will feel offended.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
161,drael64,Suspension of disbelief required - Good retelling of bad story,5,17 March 2015,"It took me a great while to get into this film, because of the inaccuracy of the biblical myth. Firstly, there is no evidence of an exodus, and if it occurred, that would certainly be obvious archaeologically. Secondly, the pyramids were not built by slaves, but by volunteers and paid workers - as archeology has proved. Slaves in ancient Egypt were treated very well, better than slaves elsewhere and they had better lives that the poor in Egypt.Thirdly, the biblical tale has such an emphasis on Yahweh, and that angle of the story, that is portrays the Egyptian mystic religion and culture as in some regards quite primitive or barbaric. It would have been amazing to see an historical account of ancient Egypt, that portrayed its music, incense, drug use, temples, neters (which does not mean Gods, it means 'natures') and technology in a way that did the golden civilization, which is one of the base roots of our own civilization, justice (even modern incense and altars, and church facing derives from Egypt. The Isis cult is remarkably similar in doctrine and ritual to the Christian religion. Make-up, perfume and aromatherapy too. It's influence is still there in our own)This biblical story probably has less truth than Robin Hood or King Arthur. Which is itself hard to look around, because it feels like a betrayal of history. But, waving away all the inaccuracies, the set pieces are compelling. The acting is competent. The plot seems to move in a natural compelling manner, even if the movie is a tad too long. The non-omniscient, childish and vengeful god does seem to be the Yahweh of the old testament. But the story is not an emotionally compelling one, nor is it an particularly entertaining one.I can only say that the makers of this movie did pretty well with the source material, but that is what let them down. The bible has great allegory, but it does not make a good collection of short stories.I am giving it a 5. It's a good retelling of a bad story (that does its part to pollute peoples view of history).

It's full of historical and biblical errors - History and Scriptures are two different things conflicting many times, so it would be best to stay truthful to the story' original source, but no...

This movie won't create any atheists and won't create any believers. What it mostly does is use the known framework of the story for the framework of the movie. Little deviations here and there but on the whole it takes the myth and brings it to life. Some want to argue about the fine points like what did god look like or sound like or who 'actually' carved the Ten Do's and Don'ts but the bottom line is if you're familiar with the myth you'll recognized the movie.

164,sujanfaster,A Magnanimous Failure,5,27 December 2014,"I have a little knowledge about the Moses-Ramsay history. Well with a director like Ridley Scott involving such a big star cast, I would care less whether or not if he gets the fact right. But I expect an epic movie if it is shown in such a way as shown in the trailer of this movie. But Exodus: Gods and Kings is more of a collage rather than a movie. The screenplay just keeps moving aimlessly. Ridley Scott probably is confused whether to make an award entry movie or a commercial blockbuster. The movie tries to be both but ends up being nowhere. There is no point in giving the brief description of the story here. Most of the people know the historical part and it may be inaccurate as well. The movie is long and tests your patience. You feel as if the movie was desperately made to show off the visual effects and the epicness. But yes, hats off to the visual effects team and the technical staff who would have had a lot to work definitely more than the screenplay or dialogue writers in this film. The same cannot be said to the editors.One of the reasons I went to watch the movie even after reading horrible reviews is because of Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton. After seeing Joel Edgerton's performance in 'Warrior' I have been a huge fan. But this movie casts him into a typical negative role and does hardly use his acting talents. Christian Bale is an actor who has set very high standards in his recent movies, be it a low budget one like 'Out of Furnace', yet he gives his best there. Here he is like a guide at a tourist place moving here and there and explaining things. Aaron Paul is just like us, a spectator in the movie. I am huge fan Aaron, I need you to choose better roles. I don't even know what to talk about the roles of Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley. Maria Valverde looks really beautiful . There is a lot of emphasis to star cast given by the production house only in vain.Exodus is a movie that you can watch if you are really curious about the Moses story and if you probably don't have anything better to do (but try finding something better to do;-)). Ridley Scott has dedicated this movie to his brother late Tony Scott, but watching a Tony Scott no brainer is a better idea of timepass.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Holy Bible, Exodus, chapter 15 verse 11: ""Mi Kamocha, Ha Shem, who is like you amongst other gods. Also Tehillim, chapter 86 verse 8 ""Amongst the gods, there are none like you."" All other gods or so called gods are false gods and idols.Christian Bale does a good job as Moses, but Charleston Heston was the greatest in all Biblical roles. My first question is with all the talented Jewish American actors {including the ones who have changed their birth last names} in Hollywood and Jewish Producers and directors, why didn't the producers hire a few Jewish actors for such roles as Moses and the role of Nun, played by Ben (Ghandi) Kingsley?It would be nice to make a movie about a land and people where the actual race and nationality of actors/actresses would be in the roles instead of hiring any race to play them.To top it off, the producers could have hired real Jewish actors and actresses from Israel to play major roles in this film. After all Jewish people believe in the Old Testament of the Holy Bible and Moses is 100% old testament, all about Jews and Israel. If a movie is going to made about events in the Holy Bible, then it should be done 100 percent correctly. Case in point, When Moses is talking to God at first as a ""burning bush"" then every subsequent scene, the little boy appears to be God. That is incorrect. According to the Holy Bible, God only appeared as the burning bush. God is a spiritual being, the Holy Bible says that ""No one can see God's face and live"". Refer to: Exodus, chapter 33 verse 20. It is like no human can look directly at the bright sunlight without going blind.Joel Edgerton is okay, but he can't top the brilliant deceased actor, Yul Brenner as Pharoah. The rest of cast is okay. However the interior and exterior settings are well done.I like director Scott movies, but this movie could have and would have been much if the producers and director believed in God and not an atheist.Toda La El.

Nothing special at all!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
167,russellingreviews,"Ridley, what were you thinking?",2,13 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is based on one of the most important stories in the Jewish and Christian traditions. The film begins with Moses (Christian Bale) as an adult. He has been raised as a prince of Egypt, a brother to the future pharaoh, Ramses (Joel Edgerton) and he is a general of the Egyptian army. He has been blessed with leadership qualities and has the respect of the Egyptian nation and his uncle, Seti, the current Pharaoh (John Turturro). After proving himself on the battlefield and a series of events, he is confronted with his actual familial history and the prophecy of his role in the salvation of the Hebrew nation. Due to the death of an Egyptian guard, Moses is exiled from his home country and eventually comes to Midian. He marries and takes on the role of husband, father and shepherd in his adoptive homeland. While chasing stray sheep on Mount Horeb, he is confronted by God who comes to him in the form of a child. He is charged with freeing the Hebrew nation from 400 years of Egyptian slavery. He is chosen because of his leadership qualities and abilities as a general. Leaving behind his family, he goes back to Egypt and confronts Ramses. Moses threatens the Pharaoh with the message from God to free the Hebrews. The Pharaoh's pride does not allow the slaves to be freed. Moses speaks to the people and trains them for battle. Moses is confronted with the eventual torture of the Hebrew slaves and he wrestles with his ongoing discussions with God. Eventually, due to the lack of response from Ramses, the plagues begin. The powerful nation of Egypt is destroyed through the decimation of it's water and food sources. Flies, frogs, locusts, boils and darkness plague the nation. When the final plague is to come, Moses goes to his adopted brother and pleads for mercy for his people and the nation of Egypt. Pharaoh does not listen and the horror of the plague occurs falls on the Egyptian people, while the Hebrews are spared the impact of the plagues. The Pharaoh relents and the slaves are set free. They journey out of Egypt, which then sets up the conclusive battle at the Red Sea.          This might be a slight revision of the story that many will know from tradition or Sunday school and church stories. Even with the reliance on good special effects for the retelling of the Biblical narrative, there was not much that could have pull this film out from under a poorly written and executed screenplay. Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien) has revised the the story to bring it to the big screen and the question has to be, why? There is always room for artistic license to fill in the gaps of the biblical narrative, but to rewrite the core of the story is inexplicable. The Bible provides a wealth of content for the writers and director, but the artistic license taken was unnecessary. The number of scriptural challenges in this film were innumerable: God depicted as a child, the role of Miriam and Aaron, the management of the plagues and the Moses' belief in God. There are enough scriptural problems for theologians to tear apart the film for days and there will be a multitude of articles written. Analysing the theological content is not the main point of this review, but some have to be addressed. The notion of Moses as a warrior has a masculine appeal, but even this nuance does not fit in the end. The depiction of God as a spoilt and vindictive child showed the lack of understanding of the story and of God. One of the biggest questions would be, where was Moses' staff? The staff that God had equipped him with for the sake of delivering the message and leading the people. The staff was not the means of salvation, but it has come to symbolise the message and how God would assist Moses in the delivery of the message and lead his people to the promised land. This detail was missing in the film and epitomised the lack of effort by the screen writers for the finer details in telling the story. Rewriting essential elements of a tale that is so familiar to many around the world will cause an opposition to the believability of this film. Sadly, the drama is provided by God for this epic tale, but in trying to minimise his role in the story takes out the heart of the story and shows Scott's lack of care to the source material.          Exodus: Gods and Kings will be inevitably compared to Noah and to a lesser degree to Son of God. To have three biblical epics portrayed within a calendar year is unprecedented and the comparisons are hard to avoid. The biggest disappointment with Exodus: Gods and Kings is not the merely the poor usage of the original narrative, but with Ridley Scott. He is a film legend and has directed some of the greatest films in history. His ability to direct is without question, but this film failed beyond Aronofsky's Noah, because of the poor use of original content. The book of Exodus is full of rich content. With the resources that are available to him, Ridley had the opportunity to put forward an epic film and to redefine the later part of his career, but he did not achieve this with Exodus. If only he had just told the story and added his artistry to fill in the gaps. It could have been great, but this film fell short. For Ridley Scott fans, this film will not put faith back into the work of this master filmmaker. For the fans of God's story, you will be frustrated by the misrepresentation of the story, but instead of railing against it, reread the account and be ready to clarify what really happened in Egypt with all that go to see this film.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
168,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,A great movie that's missing that special something,7,30 December 2014,"Throughout the years I have seen a lot of movies on this subject. Some of them were grand (The ten commandments), some of them were good TV movies (the Bible series) but this is something different. I knew Ridley Scott would do a great job, and he didn't disappoint. He had a lot of things working in his favor - a great cast, a great story, magnificent CGI, fantastic runtime and pace. So, when everything is combined, is this the best exodus movie? Unfortunately no, but it comes really close. What went wrong? Actually nothing. This movie was made as an epic spectacle and it is exactly that. But it has the same problem as the Hobbit movies - it lacks that special something that made movies like Gladiator or LOTR historic masterpieces. Bale was a good cast for Moses, and Edgerton was a really good choice. The two have great chemistry and the antagonism between them is shown and acted really well. Still, Kingsley and Weaver were so underused that it is a shame. Their roles were almost cameo roles and I believe they could have been used a bit more. The characters were a bit underdeveloped so more could have been done there (but that is the screenwriters fault and not the actors'). Turturro did a good job giving the best supporting role in the movie. The acting itself is flawless and the chemistry between the actors is superb, but the characters themselves lack layer and depth (and for a movie of this sort that is a necessity). The pace of the movie is well done (a classic Ridley Scott). It is a bit slow in the beginning and until the burning bush scene it sort of drags but at that point the second part of the movie starts and from that point onward leaves one breathless. The catastrophes were brilliantly done, fast paced, almost unnoticeable CGI (unlike the Hobbit), extremely disturbing, and the best plague sequence I have ever seen! The third part is the climax the movie was building up to. The Red sea splitting and the drowning of the Egiptians was powerful and frightening. The CGI/3D was brilliantly used and it was the best I have seen so far. Musically nothing special, no grand scores or tear dropping notes. Almost generic and forgettable. A shame for a movie like this. All in all, by reading the review one could get an idea of what this movie is made of. Technical perfection, superb acting, great pace and the best Moses movie since The ten commandments. But it is nowhere near the best Scott can do. More could have been done in character development and some characters could have been more used (Kingley, Weaver and Paul). If that was the case we would have had maybe the best Moses movie ever. Still, it is a movie I will enjoy watching more than once, I will see it often and it will not bore me even the slightest. Go with an open mind and a box full of popcorn and you will not regret it",Exodus - Gods and Kings
169,because-of-him,Wait for the free TV version...,1,25 December 2014,"Christian Bale is absolutely horrible in this movie. Why? To answer, one must look partly at why the movies 10 Commandments and The Passion were so successful. In both movies, the actors were religious, one Episcopalian, one Catholic, and believed in God. So, they had an extra kick to their acting which Christian Bale, whose heart is dark, does not.At an interview discussing Exodus: Gods and Kings, Christian Bale, an avowed atheist or agnostic, definite commie-socialist and God-hater, says this about Moses: ""I think the man was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life...He was a very troubled, tumultuous man and mercurial. But the biggest surprise was the nature of God. He was equally very mercurial."" Mercurial means, unstable; subject to sudden mood changes; volatile. In the awful movie, you will strain your eyes to find miracles. Most plagues are natural, chain reactions of events.You won't be able to reconcile the God of this movie with the God of the bible. In one bizarre moment, this Moses is at the Red Sea and yells at God while rubbing his Egyptian ring, a curled-up snake. I won't spoil the ending but to say that Pharaoh and Moses would easily win the first platinum medals at the Olympics. My suggestion, wait for the free TV version.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
170,prospectus_capricornium,Visually Epic But Utterly Boring,4,18 December 2014,"There is no denying, how mammoth and grand Exodus: Gods and Kings' ambitions are. It delivers an epic production and jawdropping visuals, but even that grandeur couldn't save the film from its failure to present a compelling and sensible story.Exodus: Gods and Kings starts proving itself as an unmistakable visual force. From the beginning it effectively transports the audience to the ancient Egypt, but as the film progresses, it gets evident that the narrative is too weak to escape the wrath of its ambitious source material. While utilizing Moses's story, his banishment from his homeland, and his friendship with Ramses are riveting enough to ignite interest, the several subplots tangled around the film's core story make it impossible to present a decent script. There is no clear path as to where the story is headed, as numerous sidestories and conflicts loom here and there, but never get resolved or establish a firm connection to the central story. Even the 'Exodus' itself, which is supposed to be the biggest turning point and climactic event in the film, isn't as exciting enough to spike attention. And even Christian Bale's not so great and unrealistic portrayal as Moses is evident. It is hard to imagine that this film is helmed by Ridley Scott, director of some of the biggest and most acclaimed movies of all time. Both Scott's towering ambition to bring the biblical event into the big screen and his failure to deliver a riveting result are both epic.This Ridley Scott's movie gets 4 stars for its phenomenal visual achievement, alone, but that is all. In general, I can only say one word about this film: BORING.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
171,slayerjmk95,"Extremely Bold and Epic, But Devoid of Power",7,7 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is Ridley Scott's most ambitious film yet, and his boldest (but not biggest). Another biblical epic after the recent releases of Darren Aronofsky's Noah and the television series- inspired film Son of God, Exodus tells the story of the exodus led by Moses from the Book of Exodus in the Bible. In the film, Moses (portrayed by Christian Bale) defies Ramesses (Joel Edgerton) and stages an uprising to escape Egypt before God's wrath is brought down upon them.Like Aronofsky's Noah, this is simply one man's (significantly) different view of the story. Except in this film, instead of adding to the mystical elements of the story, Ridley Scott instead makes the plagues out to be natural occurrences, including the parting of the Red Sea. While some will find this absurd, i find it intriguing. It must be said i am deeply spiritual, but remember, this is a movie, and movies are an art form. With that aside, now down to film details.Ridley Scott's direction here is eerily similar to what he did with Kingdom of Heaven, and i have a feeling the theatrical cut is not what Scott had in mind, as the script seems to be lacking in nearly every aspect, especially when trying to have us care for the characters and their struggle. It's not that the film is bland, but seems to be focused on the scope and scale, not what happens within said scale. The visual effects are top-notch, though, and well- deserving of the Oscar nomination (Interstellar is still the best by far). The acting is spectacular, with the two leads (Edgerton and Bale) shining bright. Even Aaron Paul as Joshua was good, who added more emotion to the film than one would expect. Sadly, though, Ben Kingsley is under-utilized in a very short performance that i feel we would see more in a director's cut. The production values are astonishing, the musical score helps to solidify that 'epic' atmosphere, and the cinematography is gorgeous, as one would expect from a Ridley Scott film.In the end, Exodus: Gods and Kings is a stunning epic that lacks the power its story is supposed to bring, but like Kingdom of Heaven, will probably surface in an even more epic director's cut (hopefully). Is Exodus one to be seen on the big screen? Yes, but should you pay top dollar? Depends. Happily, the film isn't a bad movie, unlike most blockbusters. Just don't expect a captivating, full-blown epic but instead a more visually gripping and valiant effort that falls short.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
172,bonniejoy-978-68763,Hollywood on Repeat,4,14 February 2015,"When I went to see this movie I knew what to expect (mostly), because this film came out in 2014, the same year Hercules (not Disney) did along with other Greek myths made into intense war movies. Also they took stories from the Bible like Noah and made it into an unneeded war movie when it had nothing to do with it; so why should I be surprised that some director/screen writer would be dumb enough to take the story of Moses and turn it into a war movie despite it had nothing to do with war?The story is about Moses and his brother who would later become Pharaoh of Egypt. According to a prophecy, Moses would become a leader. After receiving a call from God, he goes back to Egypt to face off his brother and free his people who had been enslaved for 430 years.Movie-wise there is just so much wrong with it: 1) My main problem with this story is, how do you turn this story into a war movie? Also, we've had so many war movies shoved into our faces in theaters. Sure the effects and the weight of the war films can be cool, but at the same time, I personally want to see something new and original. This is one of too many war films and just gives me more proof that Hollywood is not trying to be original anymore, but is throwing at us the same clichés at us, and war and love movies are currently their obsessions. It becomes annoying and predictable after a while. 2) Christian Bale might have made an okay Moses, but Joel Edgerton as Rameses (Moses' brother) was bad in his acting. I'm sure he's a great actor, but he was just not that believable in his role. 3) And the biggest stupidity (which does tie into the fact it's in a war movie): As the Red Sea is about to come crashing on the Egyptians, Moses and Rameses pose under the wave for a one on one combat. SERIOUSLY? RUN YOU IDIOTS! It may be a cool shot, but it is also a foolish move.Now let's get to what Biblically bothers me: I love the Bible and there's just so much in here that's insulting: 1) It's a war movie. The story of Moses had nothing to do with war, so why did that have to be forced in? There was no point to it. 2) God is a child. Well I don't mind that He's portrayed as a child, but this ""god"" acts like a savage killer. In fact when Moses first encounters the ""burning bush"" (which does nothing more than make a cameo, you see God more than the bush which is another error) he causes an avalanche that breaks all of Moses' bones, and he speaks to him with his body sinking in mud and doesn't care that more than his legs are broken. 3) God gets no credit for what He does. Like the plagues - actually the only plague done wrong was turning the Nile into blood. Moses' brother (true brother) Aaron dipped his staff into the Nile and it turned into blood. In the movie, crocodiles have a fight and it causes blood. No, that doesn't work. For one, blood from crocodiles wouldn't flood the entire river, and also it takes away from the story that God worked this through Aaron (btw him having little to no part in the movie counts as an error). However, despite all the bad things I've listed, there is some good from it: 1) The special effects are really cool! The scene I was excited to see was the Red Sea, because I wanted to see just how good they did it. It was relatively disappointing at first, but when the sea comes back it's impressive. 2) The scenery can be very beautiful. Around the sea it is so gorgeous. I think that shot came from some kind of island (I can't remember). 3) When the Israelites were evacuating Egypt it was intense. I don't think even 10 Commandments had that many extras! It literally looked like all of Israel was leaving! 4) I did say Joel was not a great actor in this movie, however the one or two scenes he nailed was with his son. I felt sympathy for him and his family, but for the rest of his acting I didn't buy. 5) The other scene that hit bullseye was the Passover scene where the angel of death comes. I was hoping for special effects for this creature, but we had a passing night shadow instead, but whenever it covered the first born son of Egypt, their lives were over, and I could feel chills down my spine. What makes it even more unbearable is when the mothers are wailing hard. In other Moses movies I've not really heard that kind of mourning, I guess it got glossed over, but this movie doesn't fail to show how horribly painful it was to lose a loved one. I was fighting tears at that scene, it was just that powerful.Some critics have said that this film shows the human side of Moses and how he had to learn to trust in the Lord, and while I can kinda see that in this movie I've seen better versions with that lesson done right. This movie was just so predictable, so unfaithful to the original story, and reveals Hollywood's weakness for no originality. I don't mind seeing stories I love on screen (sometimes I don't mind remakes if they're done right) but what I do mind is seeing the same thing over and over, and that's what Exodus: Gods and Kings gave me.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
173,med77_99,An Honest Review,5,14 December 2014,"I have to say that trying to make a film based on religious and Biblical stories is never an easy task, and i like that Ridley Scott accepted that challenge, though the odds where always against him. I see a lot of negative reviews here, and i can see where they come from. the biggest problem with the film, is that we all know the story already, we read it so many times and watched several older film based on the same story, this really takes out a lot of the intrigue associated with watching a film. for example, as the movie goes on, i was constantly thinking, OK so when will Moses be banished, and then after that, OK so when will the plague start. so basically i was waiting for the next event to occur which eliminates the joy of watching this.Other people are not happy with the religious aspects of the film, this is of no bother to me, because it is just a movie and the director is trying to take his own vision on the story. I am not going to be upset with changes from what is written in the scriptures, it is just a movie!Having said all that, the movie still suffers in certain areas in terms of film making. As many have already mentioned, the casting director did not do a great job with the cast, for me, i did not mind seeing Bale as Moses, he is a great actor and can blend in any role, and at least he has a dark complexion and dark hair. My problem was with Aaron Paul, the guy just does not pass as a Jew in anyway, he is white, blue eyes, blond hair, tiny body! he just does not fit as a Jew in anyway! i was distracted by his presence in the movie, not that he is a bad actor.the Cinematography and Direction, were brilliant, so were the special effects. However, we all know that these alone do not make a great movie. the film suffered from pacing problems, midway and around the end, the pace was very slow making the film feel boring at times. again, us knowing and constantly waiting for the next event might have also contributed to that! acting was also very good, Bale was excellent.so to summarize, i think the film is unjustly being bashed as the worst film in history, which is not the case, it is still a watchable film but it does have flaws, ending up being an average film. could have been better. But i am not sure how to make such a story better?? do you?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
174,dinalt10,Utter tedium,4,11 February 2017,"I'm not religious, but how do you take a story with so much potential and make it boring ?I'm not sure, but they managed it with this film.Despite some big names in the cast, the actors are never really utilised. Ben Kingsley gets an easy pay cheque, and Christian Bale's capable of much more than the script offers.And we never actually see Moses as any kind of leader (except right at the end). He just has the occasional chat with 'God', then doesn't do much else. We see no action or even interaction with the slaves. Closest we get to that is setting some boats on fire.And the plagues of Egypt are dulled down to the point they make no impact.The ending's the worst though. No dramatic parting of the seas, just a leisurely stroll over the seabed.Save your time and watch older versions if you want spectacle, and definitely acting.Honestly, seen more drama and spectacle in some TV documentaries about the subject.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
175,dutchs-1,"Don't Expect ""The Ten Commandments""",8,19 December 2014,"Not only is this a different retelling than The Ten Commandments (""10C""), it studiously avoids anything that might even remotely seem like a reference to the film. The pace of this film is a lot faster - within five minutes we're plunged into a battle between Egyptians and Hittites. Moses is exiled for murder but is given a horse and also kills two assassins sent to finish him off. He ends up at a Bedouin camp where he meets and marries Zipporah (played with exotic beauty by Maria Valverde). Their mating ritual is so complex it almost comes across as a parody of overly cautious consent rules. And he goes up on the mountain and meets God in a torrential cloudburst (and something only a geologist like me would notice, he gets caught in a very realistic debris flow). I concur with everyone else who finds it unconvincing to see God portrayed as a child, though it helped to be shown that only Moses could see him. A disembodied voice would have been much more effective, but maybe too much like the DeMille film. Moses goes back to Egypt to confront Pharaoh. DeMille's Pharaoh was haughty and arrogant, but had a nobility and grandeur about him. Well of course - he was Yul Brynner, who played every role that way. This Pharaoh is soft, whiny and sniveling. The Plagues are shown in far more and graphic detail than in 10C and the final exodus, though lacking the pageantry of 10C, nevertheless has its moving moments. The drying of the Red Sea is well envisioned and the returning water is a lot more menacing than 10C. And in contrast to the relentless blue skies of 10C, the skies in this film are almost entirely gray. Watch this film as a telling in its own right, because Ridley Scott is not Cecil B. DeMille.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
176,Molongirl,Dreary,2,4 December 2015,"Godless telling of the story of the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. Godless in the sense that there is no resemblance whatever between God who speaks to Moses in the Bible and the spoilt brat child figure who pops up in this dreary movie every so often to have a cuppa with Moses. Is this how the atheist writers imagine ""god""? I wouldn't believe in him either. The lighting, the music, the script, the acting even the special effects are just plain dreary. There is no passion or love, and especially no belief just a soulless enactment of a cardboard story very loosely based on Exodus. It hasn't quite plumbed the depth of Jon Voight's Noah so that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. Why oh why not actually tell the real Bible story which has life and soul and powerful characters. A Moses who knows he is Hebrew, who kills then runs, who learns wisdom over 40 (not 9) years in Midia, who reluctantly returns to Egypt because he feels inadequate for the task. A Moses who ends up speaking to God face to face as with a friend. And a Pharaoh who realises it's a battle between his gods and the God of the Hebrews, each plague representing one of the gods worshipped by the Egyptians being systematically defeated. I do hope Ridley Scott doesn't tackle the plagues of Revelation (coming to a planet near you soon), maybe he'd have aged God slightly and have him throwing teenage tantrums. You could write a book on the problems with this movie whereas it could have been so good if they didn't mess with the original story.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This weekend we watched Ridley Scott's take on the Old Testament on our mighty plasma TV and it looked great but of course lacked the impact of that ancient movie. Times change, we get inured to the special, novelties all too rapidly become a given on life's ratchet.
Without giving the game away even though most know the story from Sunday School, I thought it was well done, well acted, well photographed etc. It ticked all the boxes but somehow fell short. It seemed like a sequence of alternate flash and dialogue, talking exposition then crash bang wallop or is that how all movies are made these days?
Plus of course, we have LOTR and GoT to poison the well of our expectations... and for me another attempt to get my head around Scott's Alien Covenant and failing.

178,TheMovieSnob247,"Underwhelming and miscast, Gods and Kings is a woeful representation of the biblical tale",4,27 December 2014,"Well that was disappointing. I loved the trailer for this film (specifically the 3rd trailer as it was excellent) so I was really looking forward to seeing this. Even though the casting choices seemed ridiculous (for obvious reasons), I still wanted to see it. Even after the reviews came in mostly negative, I still held out hope. As much as I hate to admit it, the critics were spot on.Exodus Gods and Kings is the biblical story of Moses. Born a Hebrew, but raised as an Egyptian in Pharaoh's palace in secret, Moses (Christian Bale) was raised as if he was a son of Pharaoh (John Turturro) and could even be his successor. Eventually the truth of his roots are revealed and he's cast out of Egypt by Ramses (Joel Edgerton), who assumed the throne after his fathers death. After wandering in the dessert for a time, Moses eventually begins a new life and starts a family. However, one night as he was while tending his sheep, Moses encounters God and his life's purpose is revealed: he must return to Egypt, defy the Pharaoh and free his people from bondage.While I think the movie followed most of the biblical elements, there was definitely some use of artistic license and glossing over of key story elements. I found Ridley Scott's (Gladiator, Prometheus) interpretation of God and Moses' encounters with him to be very flawed. Moses rarely feared God nor was he in awe of him. It seemed he as if Moses was speaking with an equal and not an all powerful, all omnipotent being. This was one of the main flaws for me, as I found this to be a bizarre and puzzling interpretation. Scott also essentially relegates The Ten Commandments to a footnote, which is a glaring omission (to say the least). Admittedly, I understand that in this day an age, it's impossible to make a 4 hour movie (unless you split it in two and Hollywood has no problem doing that these days), but it just seems there wasn't much exploration of certain aspects of the story and maybe this is the rare case where two movies would've made sense. The story was at times engaging, but far less so than this year's Noah. Both of these films are based on biblical stories I'm well aware of from my childhood, yet Noah was far more compelling and suspenseful regardless (Rocket Launchers and rock Transformers aside). The performances were sub-par; at no point did I feel lost in the characters. Egerton (Animal Kingdom, Gatsby) lacks the screen presence and the authority as an actor to pull off Ramses. His performance is tame and really unconvincing; it's clear he was miscast in this role. This performance pales in comparison to that of Yul Brynner in Demille's 1956 adaptation (and it's not close). While Christian Bale (The Fighter, American Hustle) is serviceable as Moses, serviceable performances are not what I've come to expect from him. I'm not sure if Bale just couldn't find a way to relate to the character, but this has to be his least convincing performance in some time. Charlton Heston and Jul Brynner commanded the screen and delivered believable performances. Bale and Edgerton pale in comparison, to say the least. Whether or not actors need to believe in Christianity is irrelevant; great actors make you believe their struggle, their experience, draw you into the film's world. Bale and Edgerton fail to do that here and the usual passion that's undeniable in Bale's performances is noticeably absent. While it's clear it has numerous flaws, the production team was not one of them. The special effects were very well done; the film did an excellent job of portraying the plagues that descended upon Egypt and this is where the 3D shined. The way the parting of the Red Sea was not quite how I expected it, but it was stunning none the less at times. The battle scenes with chariots were fairly entertaining, but too scarce in my opinion (again, I wished the movie was longer). The musical score was not very effective in really driving home powerful scenes or significant moments. Maybe I was wrong to expect a booming score similar to what Hans Zimmer did in Scott's epic Gladiator, but that would've been more appropriate here given the grand tone this film was attempting to convey. I'm usually a huge fan of Ridley Scott's work, but not here. The film seems to lack a consistent theme and doesn't have any kind of vision for what it's trying to impart. The one thing you can say about Noah, was that it's theme was clear: while Noah obeyed God, it came with a great personal struggle. Bale's Moses at times lacked passion (one way or the other). Even worse, God's and Kings does feel like it's going through the motions. As in OK, at this part of the Moses story this happens and then here, this happens and oh, let's not forget to throw this bit in as well (with little or no elaboration). There was no real cohesion to the story. I left the theatre realizing just how good The Ten Commandments was and wanting to watch it again to get the bitter taste out of my mouth. That film inspired me, wowed me. Exodus Gods and Kings left me feeling, well, nothing. For an epic film, I can't think of a more damming indictment. Very disappointing and not worth seeing. Unfortunately, Cecil B. Demille's The Ten Commandments (1956) remains of the definitive film adaptation of the story of Exodus. Amazingly, after almost 60 years it still has no equal.Was my review not horrible? Great!

179,gianlucamarzano16,Wait for on demand.,7,14 December 2014,"Exodus: gods and kings is the story about Moses going against Ramses and trying to save 600,000 slaves. Now I understand many people had problems with this movie(casting). It didn't bother me but if you do have a problem about it,you will not enjoy it. Back to the movie, the acting was great by Christian Bale(Moses) and Joel Edgerton(Ramses). Big under use of Aaron Paul and sigourney Weaver,they had like one line in the whole movie. What I will give this movie probs for is the visuals. They were amazing and Ridley Scott always does a great job with that. Overall Exodus: gods and kings is good movie with okay story and great visuals but you can wait for on demand to see it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
180,blufrog49,S-l-o-w,5,13 December 2014,"Give me Charleston Heston and Yul Brenner any day over this emotionless, boring re-telling of the Jews escape from Egypt. While not nearly as ridiculous or offensive as ""Noah,"" if you react as I did, you'll feel like YOU have spent 40 years after just a few days of the story.At first, I was willing to give it a pass, for taking so long to set up for the conflict, thinking, well, even though this is one of the most well-known stories of the Bible and Torah, maybe some people need the narrative's basics. But even that is poorly done.(Do I really need a spoiler here?)The plagues were the best part. The only chemistry was between Moses and his wife, and those scenes were minimal. (And what happened to Miriam?) Scott pretty much stuck to the traditional story--no transformer boulders, no magic stones. But it's also not ""Gravity""--the long sweeping cinematography, the lack of dialogue--does not work for the dessert. Get to the point, already! While I am loathe to say it seemed the rest of the audience was equally bored, the folks I spoke with had pretty much the same opinion as I--or worse.Read the book.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
181,thomas-w15,Long and boring,3,24 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings- Directed by critically-acclaimed director Ridley Scott, who has been known to make some pretty epic movies(Gladiator, Prometheus...), Exodus: Gods and Kings looks epic in spectrum of the film. Great director, great actors, and a seemingly great story of Moses. The trailer portrays the film as a non-stop thriller with not a single boring second allowed. The trailer is the definition of misleading. Although there are some relatively epic moments in the movie, Exodus: Gods and Kings suffers from an over- written and boring script and even Batman cannot save this film. The trailer advertises the film highlighting the ten plagues as the main story line of the film. The plagues did look spectacular because no film has shown how the plagues would actually look. Everyone in the theater was in awe during this period....which lasted about ten minutes. The plagues that almost everyone in the theater probably came to see lasted for about ten minutes. Yes, there are also a few decent battle scenes, but those are also short and the rest of the film suffice to say, is boring. The person who adapted this film for the screen really did a poor job because with the exception of about twenty minutes, the entire film makes the audience fall asleep dreaming about seeing a Exodus film worthy of Christian Bale's acting. I was still thankful Christian Bale was the lead role because without him, people would have literally walked out of the theater. He plays Moses down to a tee. He doesn't play the nice, gentle savior who freed hundreds of thousands of slaves. He plays the firm, decently- minded leader who does the best job he can trying to free 600,00 slaves under God's very vague instruction. Joel Edgerton plays Rhamses the Great, one of the biggest biblical villains with ease. He makes you hate him right away. The rest of the cast were not given enough screen-time to show depth and development in their characters which was upsetting because I was looking forward to seeing how Aaron Paul would play Moses's right hand Joshua. If the director used all the talent he had in his film, the movie would have been at least twice as good.Although the trailer looks enticing, I recommend you wait until the DVD release to see Exodus: Gods and Kings.

182,sjensenstrad,40 minutes in an I am quitting,2,18 November 2015,"as I state in the title I am about 40 minutes in the movie or something like that and I will stop after I have written this review.The story is superficial, boring and the casting is a failure. I cant recall in the old testament that Moses did not knew he was Hebrew.The story jumps in mysterious ways. Then Moses suddenly got married, where did that women come from, while I writing this he is living as a sheep farmer and now he is walking in the mountain and suddenly covered in mud.I do not really care at all See you exodus",Exodus - Gods and Kings
183,hou-3,Enjoyable romp with some nice touches,7,29 June 2015,"We have to accept that Ridley Scott's glory days have gone and there will never be another Alien or Bladerunner, maybe not even another Gladiator. But given a decent script he is still an effective director and I thought this film was better than the hostile reviews suggested. I like the way the script writer didn't even try to avoid anachronism, embracing modern language. That was audacious but it worked. I liked Moses's abrasive relationship with the primary school aged God. And I really took to Iglesias's score. The film is well paced, until the closing scene, when Scott seemed to just shrug his shoulders and run the credits - 'that's all folks'. Of the great set pieces, the plagues are outstanding, really well managed. The crossing of the Red Sea is pretty effective. The ten commandments ... well, by that point Scott was putting his coat on and turning off the lights. Christian Bale plays Moses with a credible mix of heroism and self-doubt. Shades of Russell Crowe both as Maximus and as Noah. Actually there was quite a lot of Gladiator recycled, including Ramases Senior saying Moses should be his successor and the flaming arrows zooming in on the Nile. Why not? If it worked in Gladiator ... And how wonderful to see Sigourney Weaver being directed by Scott a full 35 years after Scott directed her dodging the Alien!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
184,seashellz,Interesting....,4,16 December 2014,"most of the first 8-10 pages of reviews were 5 star or less. Then the later reviews up to the present go to 7-8-9 stars. Company shills forced to write good reviews if they want an Xmas bonus? I have not seen the film, But watching the previews, i thought ""This looks a bit schlocky- over the top"" and then, with the non stop ads and entire programs devoted to EXODUS on TV playing 24/7 before the opening....i knew this would be a flop.The thing is, I love all of the other films by Ridley Scott all the way back to THE DUELLISTSI also really liked ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER",Exodus - Gods and Kings
185,ricardopthomaz,"An OK film, but I rather take the 1956 DeMille version any day!",7,27 December 2014,"In 1923, the great cinematographer and director Cecil B. DeMille did his first version of The Ten Commandments. Decades later, in 1956 Mr. DeMille remade his movie into a huge and epic production starring Charlton Heston as Moses, the one version that we remember the most. This way, Mr. DeMille not only became one of the few directors, along with Alfred Hitchcock, to remake his own movie, but also marked his name in movie history forever. Recently, The Ten Commandments earned lots of remakes, including one in 2006, another one in 2007 starring Ben Kinsley (by the way, he's in this movie too) and even a musical version starring Val Kilmer. As many other adaptations from the book of Exodus that were also made time and again getting different titles across the years, but the essence and legacy from DeMille to make those other versions never disappeared and never will. Now, in 2014, Ridley Scott takes the responsibility to again, render this biblical tale to the big screen, this time, known as Exodus: Gods and Kings.Is it any good? Yes, but not that good either. In fact every other Ridley Scott recent movie venture has been from OK to pathetic, none of them were even good. This movie is his best one since his 2008 Body of Lies. The photography is great, but with the 3D glasses, it gets dark in some scenes and that affects your experience. The other good thing is the cast. Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton were good as Moses and Ramses, but I think they lacked some qualities inherent to those historical figures. The make up was also close to perfect, as it was difficult for me to recognize actors like Sigourney Weaver as Tuya, John Turturro as Seti and Aaron Paul as Joshua. Another thing that called my eye and it doesn't have in the classic DeMille versions was the figure of God as a little boy. I just think this was a great touch to the story! The historical reconstructions from the scenarios to the wardrobe were also beautiful.But, the movie fails in its edition, which is too cracked at times and too fast, not giving us time to reflect about what we just saw. There's also war right in the beginning, which I thought to be a very displeasing misstep. I think it was one of the most unnecessary scenes that I saw in my life, I got myself thinking, ""what? Action and war right in the very beginning? What a ripoff! Couldn't they just wait a little longer to give us the spectacle of flesh and blood? The DeMille remake is so patient, calm and collected, it's just so fluent, and that's because it doesn't rush the action to the beginning of the movie!"". I caught myself telling those things to my wife and she also found unnecessary having that action fragment so soon. Plus, I understand that it was to establish that Ramses and Moses were like ""blood"" brothers and one would do everything to protect the other, but... again, I can think about a thousand other ways to establish all that without that war scene!I also understand that Scott was entitled to give a different approach to the way things are and happen, in order to not look like he was copying and pasting De Mille's version. For example, Moses didn't have his stick and, instead of the sea being divided, its water amount is just reduced to the bare minimum so the Hebrews could cross it. But still, it looks like it's missing something to this modern translation of the tale.Bottom line: a good movie, but it could've been much better. I still prefer the unbeatable and close to perfect 1956 version from Cecil B. DeMille. It's bigger, it's better, it's so much more concise, coherent and addressing and it certainly still holds a spot in the heart of every people who watched even to these modern days. Just watch the scene from Charlton Heston holding his stick and opening his arms so God could open the sea to the Hebrews and you'll get the idea of the magnitude of this rendition of the story.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
186,vav-61764,Astonishing Visual Effects and Christian Bale's Great Performance Are The Highlights of The Movie,7,28 June 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is the latest movie about Moses's story and it's directed by Ridley Scott. The scenarios and landscapes, either created by CGI or real places, are something to be recognized, because they're astonishing. The creation and setting of them are spectacular, Ridley Scott once again proves he's a mastermind in creating the movie sets. The immersion in the Ancient Egypt occurs in such depth which is something really interesting to have, even seeing that one of the greatest civilization of human's history was built through the slave labor of thousands of other people subjugated by the Egyptians. The characters's clothing and makeup is another positive side of this film, over all, the production of this movie did a real nice job.Even if is based in a Bible's story, the movie tries to please both science and religion. It presents not a benevolent God, but a powerful and mean God, that when He has to do some actions which will make the people suffer, He won't hesitate, a similar God with the Old Testament. In the other side, during the plagues and all the acts of God, there's an effort to explain with logic and scientific reasons the happenings. But there's no doubt that religion is something very powerful throughout the whole movie. The plagues are the aspect which stands out, they're so vile, you feel agony watching them, surely is the best part of the movie.Christian Bale is the one who gives the best performance of the cast, he presents not an unbreakable and blind guy due to his faith in God. Surely he has a huge faith in God, but in some moments he questions Him and feels uncomfortable with the acts of God.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
187,koen_smit,The only aspect that made this movie bearable to watch are the special effects.,6,9 January 2015,"I am a little bit sceptic about the biblical stories put on film. Not because they are not interesting or dramatic enough, but because they tend to become very pretentious and humourless. Exodus: Gods and Kings is unfortunately no different. The first 60-90 minutes of the movie rushes by, there is little character development, you have no idea what the wars are all about and whose role is what within the political settings of Ancient Egypt. People meet, get married and you don't know why. It feels like they made the movie, but it was a few hours too long and they decided to cut the so important character development and kept only the action scenes. I was actually getting bored after a while and starting yawning. It was somewhat entertaining, yes, but with none of the characters having any charm or at least being likable, it was just screen-filling waste. Maybe if I did read the story before, some things will have been more clear, but my biblical friend I took with me to the cinema felt exactly the same. After Moses went back to Egypt it got a little more interesting, we got the plagues, a quite brilliant child-actor and the actual Exodus. And the sea, that was the best part of the movie. But if a splitting and rushing sea is the best part of the movie, what does that say about the rest? You have a great actor who plays Moses, but he is a servant to the oh so important story, instead of giving Moses the heart and soul that would make it interesting. And there we have it: what this movie lacks is a heart and a soul. Ridley Scott made an overproduced, shallow and heartless debacle, which everyone will have forgotten within a year. The only aspect that made this movie bearable to watch are the special effects. Please next time put some humour and heart into a biblical story.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
188,CharlieGreenCG,Ridley Scott's best since Gladiator.,8,18 December 2014,"God has made a couple of movie appearances in blockbusters this year. Firstly, there was Darren Aronofsky's Noah, showing how Russell Crowe takes on the bearded wise man in God's footsteps. In between was Son of God. Now this, Ridley Scott's Exodus: Gods and Kings. A new take on the great biblical tale.It's a well-worn story – certainly one that has been passed around for a few thousand years at least. But, fresh with Scott's auteur film-making; spectacular effects and stellar casting, it feels like something new entirely – and easily secures itself as the best biblical story to arrive on the big screens for at least thirty-odd- years.For those who missed Sunday school, Exodus is based on the feud between Moses and Ramses as God directs Moses to lead the 600,000 enslaved Israelites out of the Egyptian empowerment.Granted, the effects in Exodus are incredible and encompass real God-like abilities on the screen. Teamed with recent collaborating cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, Scott supersedes any of his films made over the past ten-years and claims this as his greatest film since Oscar-winning Gladiator.Similar to Gladiator, the lead-cast taking on the swords-and-sandals sub-genre are incredibly well performed – but often do not fit into the roles likeness. In Exodus, taking on the Eastern and African roles are Americans, British and Australians. But more specifically, Christian Bale as Moses, Joel Edgerton as Ramses and co-starring likes of Sir Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver (although, she only has one line – completely underused), John Turturro, Aaron Paul and Ben Mendelson.For 150 minutes, Exodus tells the story between Moses and Ramses. It's a tale many have heard before, in fact done masterfully by Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments some sixty-years ago – but Exodus gives it a fresh perspective. Moses' perspective more so. One that chronicles how he beings a strong atheist and military general alongside Ramses as a brother, through to how he accepts that there is a God and leads thousands in this vision.Throughout, and not even attempting to diverge from the detailing in the bible, the film shows Gods savagery within the ten plagues, right down to the one where he kills small children as they sleep – yes, it happens, Old Testament God was not very nice. It also shows Moses' portrayed as a freedom fighter come terrorist against Edgerton's tyrannical portrayal of Ramses, which is powerful to witness. But, positively, there are no signs of giant CGI rock creatures appearing to save the day – oh, Noah.More hindrance than help, Exodus does not just beat around the (burning) bush, but it follows every detail. As many will know, the Red sea parts where Moses and co' cross through. This is where the film should have ended. But it didn't. It continued on for another twenty-something-minutes with freedom scenes and the Ten Commandments tablet written some years later. Which is great, but leaves the gripping epic in all its entirety to finish in such anti- climactic style.Exodus: Gods and Kings is Ridley Scott's best film since Gladiator. Not as good mind, but still damn entertaining in biblical portions.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
189,Randy_Dreammaker,This has to be the most boring and inaccurate retelling of the Exodus story in filmmaking history.,2,20 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) is so off track from the Torah or biblical story that like the Noah (2014) movie, it becomes an entirely different story altogether.One would imagine, that with four screenplay writers and access to the Torah and Bible, that it would be near impossible to mess up such a popular and well known story for a major movie picture. Instead they present creative and imaginative solutions to twist one of the greatest stories of all time into an uninspired story.Christopher Bale as the lead actor in the role of Moses unfortunately was a poor selection, despite Bale being a great actor. his role seems more medieval rather than Hebrew or Egyptian. Bale also lacks any accent that would prevent the film from portraying Moses as an Englishman.The god of this movie is definitely not the Hebrew God of the Israelites; instead appearing as a bald-headed Buddha or ""The Last Emperor"" like child. A democratic and indecisive god who lets Moses figure out how to pull off the greatest rescue of all time, on his own.This movies child god lectures and rationalizes with Moses, randomly appears, and even throws a temper tantrum when Moses doesn't comply. The writers Exodus god is introduced as though a hallucination or delusion experienced by Moses after he is engulfed and survives a massive mudslide.Moses remains in this delusional state as he takes it on his own accord to raise up a group of Hebrews whom he trains into terrorist to lead into battle against Pharaoh. And what about Camels, instead of camels you get horses, Lots and lots of horses. until the end when a few camels are shown.When this Moses is evicted from Egypt, instead of taking a camel into the hard Egyptian desert, he takes a horse, which of course would and did die of thirst. To resolve the problem of Moses now being horseless, two bandits appear whom Moses gleefully kills and acquires fresh horses.The plagues in this particular telling of the Moses feels disassociated from the rest of the story, lacking any real purpose other than being a series of strange events that occur when Moses shows up alone to confront Pharaoh. When it comes to the Passover, Moses tells the Hebrews to put lambs blood on and over the door posts of their homes, but when asked why, he has no clue. It just seemed like a good idea to him. He seems to be winging-it.Unlike the Biblical or Torah accounts of the story of Moses, the plagues in this movie are not preemptive warnings, nor forewarnings of things to come, nor a prelude opportunity for Pharaoh to consider releasing the Hebrews from slavery.Perhaps most amusing in this fantastical retelling of the Exodus story are the giant Alligators who eat everyone sailing on the Nile River (and their ships), which turns the water bloody. Not just in that area of the Nile, but the entire Nile. This is almost as amusing as the Giant Rock People in the 2014 NOAH movie.A giant mistake in this movie is the lack of the power encounter and showdown between the power of the Hebrew God v.s the priests of the many Egyptian god's. But I suppose with the way the rest of this movie retells the story, the audience should be thankful that these writers in particular didn't bother to included it. They would have just messed it up. However, being a key element in the Torah and Biblical account of the Exodus story, this movie's plot line is fragmented.This has to be the most boring paradoxical version of the Exodus story ever told on film in the history of filmmaking. Think of Will Smith's and M. Night Shyamalan's movie failure ""After Earth"". If one can believe it, or believe anything after watching this movie, it makes ""After Earth"" an enjoyable movie. Maybe when it comes time for DVD and Bluray release, they can sell it as a combo pack of Exodus, Noah and After Earth.... that's sure to be a winner. (Sarcasm)If Hollywood wants to be taken serious in the making of religious movies based on the Torah or Bible, it needs to learn from Mel Gibson and ""The Passion of the Christ"". A movie which was phenomenal, was true to the essence of the story and didn't distort or rewrite the story by taking unnecessary creative freedom and liberties.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
190,jan_kalina,"""Who worships such a god?""",10,15 January 2015,"For a biblical epic the religion isn't presented in a positive light. In fact it is presented in a quite neutral way. And I have to say I enjoy this fact that no religious propaganda is being forced down my throat. In my opinion seeing these biblical characters as normal men and women brings them closer to feel for them, to start to sympathize with them. Which might also bring people closer to religion.The story skips the obligatory baby in the basket rescued in the river beginning and jumps right into action which might seem necessary but that is what the audience came for. Christian Bale carries the film on his shoulders from the start and he proves once again why he deserves to be called one of the best actors of this generation. He is one those actors who you believe every word that comes out of their mouth. Joel Edgerton is not very convincing in the start but when he turns into the arrogant pharaoh he becomes a lot more fun. Ben Kingsley can not be missing from a historical film like this and Sigourney Weaver is absolutely redundant. She is in the film for two scenes and says like two lines. Issac Andrews comes as the biggest surprise in the film. I just don't understand where does Hollywood keep finding these talented child actors. He plays God's messenger (or is it God in person?) who is depicted as malevolent, mysterious, mischievous boy, who gives answers in a very ambiguous way.From the start it seems like Ridley Scott will bring a usual standard historical fare but when The Plagues kick in you can bet you will get yours money's worth. They are visually creative, filled with ideas and immensely entertaining.From the beginning the film seems like a typical sword and sandal film but then the film turns into a biblical carnage of epic proportions that is fun, creative and a perfect film for the holidays. This the proof that Ridley Scott is still an amazing filmmaker who will hopefully keep on bringing great films.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
191,thedukeofmovietown,Totally betrayed the spirit of the story,4,31 October 2016,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is the telling of the famous story of Moses and the liberation of the Jews from Egyptian rule. It's also a remake of a Charleton Heston classic so the makers of the film were pretty gutsy to even attempt to tackle this film, even though some would say that this film is due for a remake. Luckily for this movie, it has a lot of talent to back this massive undertaking including Christian Bale, Ben Kingsley, Joel Edgerton and John Turturro.Let me start by saying that I did like a lot of this movie. The special effects, especially the scene with the plagues, are pretty intense and the way Moses is portrayed by Bale is pretty good for the first half of the film. It syncs up with the source material pretty well and though Bale might not look the part(I'll get to that in a minute), he gives an unseen yet accurate portrayal of the ex-general's demeanor. Joel Edgerton also does a good job as Ramesses in this. His arrogant yet somewhat insecure nature plays very close to the way one would assume he must have been according to the story. In fact, the relationship between Ramesses and Moses through the first act of the film is perhaps the best part of the movie.I've said a lot of good things about this movie regarding the first half and with good reason because unfortunately, all of this movie's many problems show up in the second and third acts. The core of the movie's problems come from poor writing. There are a lot of changes made to the original Bible story and albeit they are tiny changes and the intent behind them is to try to make a more interesting story and I understand the want to make it more action packed, but the changes that they made weaken some of the characters and undercut the power in the whole story in general. For instance, Moses carries an Egyptian sword with him throughout the movie instead of his famous staff, sure the sword looks cool and it makes Moses look pretty gangsta when he pulls it out on people but the depth of story and the overall strength of Moses' character are lost because of it. It's changes like these that weaken the narrative of the story and later provide problems in keeping the movie's tone correct. Now to address the elephant in the room, the casting in this movie is absolutely ludicrous. All the extras in the movie are tan and brown skinned people who look indigenous to the Egyptian setting, but the lead roles are all the whitest white people that there are in Hollywood! Christian Bale, Sigourney Weaver, Aaron Paul, and Ben Mendelshon are all in this and seeing their faces in contrast to everyone else in this movie is just so jarring that in every beat of dramatic tension I kept asking myself, ""why are they SOOO white?!"" Even the little kid they get to represent God in this is just the whitest British kid ever and I'm sorry, but it just took me out of the movie! I would have loved to see someone like Dominic Cooper in this or Faran Tahir or ANYBODY slightly brown to bring a little realism to the film.Overall, even though I did like some parts of the film, ultimately I can't really in good conscience recommend anyone rush out to see it especially with this winter being packed so tightly with better films. Exodus: Gods and Kings gets a 2...out of 5.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
192,joris-nightwalker,Better than expected,7,12 January 2015,"The sole reason why I went to see this film was Ridley Scott. If there's anyone who has proved himself a master of (semi-)historical epic movies, it's him. From his debut The Duellists to 1492: Conquest of Paradise to his modern classic Gladiator to more recent epics Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood, Scott just knows how to visualize stories like this. That doesn't mean all those movies are good movies. As a matter of fact, personally I only like 1492: Conquest of Paradise and Gladiator. But they are entertaining and often nice to watch. Exodus: Gods and Kings isn't any different. Some captivating scenes (like the one where the Egyptian army, lead by Moses and Ramses, attack the Hittite settlement) and a nice adaptation of the generally known biblical tales of Exodus make this a fun movie to watch. Due to the great lack of drama Scott succeeded in preventing to romanticize too much (except for the character of Zipporah), but it can also be seen as a huge flaw: female actors are ridiculously underused. Especially Hiam Abbass, Sigourney Weaver, Tara Fitzgerald and Golshifteh Farahani are barely more than props... There's some irony in that, but at the same time it's a missed opportunity to make a biblical film with strong female characters. While the drama in Exodus: Gods and Kings is low, the semi-historical approach is quite pleasant. Ramses II, Seti I, Tuya and Nefertari are all historical characters, while Moses, Joshua, Zipporah, Bithiah, Miriam and Aaron are all biblical. The mix of both makes Scott's views on the matter quite interesting, both for (moderate) Christians and (moderate) atheists. After seeing the ten plagues semi-rationally explained (including some ecological lessons, which are much more subtle than in Darren Aronofsky's Noah) and God depicted as a vindictive child, I couldn't help but enjoy this movie more than expected.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

196,cmcastl,Everything depended upon the casting of Moses,6,28 January 2018,"Ridley Scott has never made a bad looking film but he has seldom made an excellent one. Several reasons, including: * He seems incapable of discriminating between a bad script and a good script. * He is dependent upon the casting.But this was a film worth watching. It caught the majesty, simultaneously barbaric and spiritual, of its Biblical source.The script was variable but had its moments.But what let this film down was the total miscasting of Christian Bale who showed no depth in the role of Moses, at all. Charlton Heston was more nuanced in the Ten Commandments and Charlton Heston was not noted of being a nuancing actor! But the film, for those of us interested in the Bible, was still worth watching for its production values, some powerfully mystic moments, such as the falling star precipitating the parting of the Red Sea, and the utterly gorgeous Maria Valverde as Moses' wife Zipporah.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
197,eucalyptus9,Life of Moses,1,2 May 2015,"Ah, I get it. Ridley Scott and Christian Bale got together and said, let's make a comedy about Moses. A kind of ""Life of Moses"" in similar vein to Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"". Well, it's not as funny as ""Life of Brian"", but probably funnier than a Seth Rogen or Adam Sandler movie. Like the Hebrew slaves (who are working double-shifts in their spare time) training to be warriors by learning to ride horses like Comanches and fire arrows into effigies of the Hebrew families being hanged by Ramses every day. Har! Har! What a hoot! Or the iron foundry being run by the slaves, with fire and smoke and hammers banging against steel, under the noses of Egyptian guards and Hebrew spies and whoever else passes by, but nobody has a clue! Crikey, cracked me up.The sad thing is that in the face of the endless crap being produced by so many clowns, you hope that you can rely on folks like Scott and Bale for a bit of quality cinema. I didn't see ""Noah"" but heard it was awful, yet Darren Aronofsky and Russell Crowe have been responsible for a lot of good movies in the past 20 years. Same thing. Still, unless ""Noah"" had Seth Rogen or Adam Sandler in it, it couldn't have been worse than this load of tripe served up by Scott and Bale.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
198,agblum,Marginal Thumbs Up for Acting and Visuals,7,14 December 2014,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"", Directed By Ridley Scott is the latest version of the Biblical story of Moses and the Exodus of the Hebrews/Jews from Egypt. I'll say what I said when I reviewed ""Noah"", released earlier this year: A Movie is not a Documentary. While we would like a movie based on events that happened, or believed to have happened (depending on your beliefs in this case) to be the truth or as close to it as possible. In the end a movie is meant to entertain, while a Documentary is meant to give all the facts. Obviously it's impossible to do a documentary on The Exodus from Egypt or any other Biblical Story – We only know what is in the Bible, and Legends surrounding it. For all that I have learned to date of the story - If your looking for a straight forward version – You'll simply going to be disappointed. Liberties are taken with the story. Is Scott's movie entertaining? To a Point - Yes. Christian Bale is simply one of the best actors today in my opinion, and he give a great performance as Moses. His Moses is confident at the start of the film, before his origins are revealed. When his origins are revealed to him – he immediately questions to the validity of it, and his faith in how events play out, is a theme throughout the movie. The rest of the cast generally does a good job as well. The visuals for the most part are also a highlight. I was very much engaged during the 1st half of the movie. During the 2nd, at times, I wasn't as much, as I was trying to role with the changing aspects of how the story goes or has been portrayed in the past. Also – Not completely, but at times, the emotional relationship between characters could have been heightened.If you can remove yourself from the Biblical story – Take the Movie as it is – Not saying it's easy - Not Great, but at times a good, engaging movie – particularly again, for the acting and visuals. Marginal Thumbs Up - 2 1/2 out of 4 Stars.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

200,infoalwaysacritic,Sumptuous visuals cannot save a confusing mess of a story,4,28 September 2015,"One cannot see a Ridley Scott film, and not think of the respect and proficiency of his past work. This attention to detail and visual prowess is not misplaced in the dramatic effects and scale that this film presents. Grandiose settings and scrupulous attention to historical environments are satisfyingly put on display in the locations and sets of the film. The conflict this arises in the mind of this viewer is why the same attention was not given to the characters.Christian Bale wavers between moments of brilliant humanity and sheer comedy, but this is largely the fault of the director and not the actor. The same element that creates such a conflicting view are responsible for what I consider a sabotaging of Joel Edgerton from a truly great performance. Repetitive and confusing uses of the same locations and costumes disturbs the sense of flow and time between events taking place, compressing the story and dissolving the emotions that should have been associated with the plagues and significant relationships. Moses' family is almost non-existent in the film, his romance with Zipporah limited to essentially a single dialogue before they are magically moved from a state of distrust and mystery to marriage.While expected to diverge some from source texts, this film departs not just from events, but undermines and ultimately misunderstands the characters of that text. While there are some that would argue this is not relevant to every viewer, it may not be unreasonable to think that large audiences of such an epic would be offended by Ridley Scotts portrayal of the Hebrew Slaves as terrorists who confusingly waged a guerrilla war while enslaved, or by his portrayal of the Hebrew God as an angry and immature child out for revenge. These offences aside, the portrayal of such characters serves to damage the continuity of the story the movie tries to tell.Ultimately the stunning scope and visual spectacle of the film do not save the film from falling over itself in an attempt to tell a worldly tale of biblical proportions, in an emotionless manner.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
201,Ceredon1,Horrible,1,11 September 2015,"As bad as Noah and that's saying a lot.Honestly, Disney's animated film stayed more true to the basics of the story. To say this was over the top is being kind. It's shows that Scott never read the story nor cared to even ask around what some of the pertinent points were. It honestly seems as though he skimmed some cliff notes, burned the notes and then scribbled a script based on not having read the cliff notes. It's easy to say he took artistic license but if he's trying to tell a well known and well loved story he should at least try to get some of the basics right. Well, I mean he at least got Moses name correct and the country. Pretty much everything was just tripe.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Needless to say about the performance of Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton also had given a good performance. Even with all these, the movie lags in stressing emotions between the characters which sometimes gives disinterested feeling. There are many scenes around 30 minutes that might have been included in the extended version and slacked off. Exodus, is a visual treat in more than few places, though invariably it isn't interesting.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Beautiful scenery, great camera-work (taking us closer to the action) with glorious sound and special effects! Although I personally believe this was a missed opportunity to show what the Bible tells us (hence why I don't give it 10 out of 10), the story portrayed in the movie is still amazing, and the way all actors and director did their job make this movie an enjoyable one (regardless of personal faith).",Exodus - Gods and Kings

No bloody substance whatsoever, instead, let's get white A-list actors and Ridley + 150 million and produce a fantasy tale with the typical mesmerizing special effects. We all know that this will at least be a hit at the boxoffices. Bloody hell how ludicrously waste of no brain at all. But it sells, right...Secondly, all i read in the user reviews are two types - wannabe-movie-knowitall-brats and biased christians.. everywhere. The christian reviewers are especially notable for their ridiculous outrage for this movie not following their vision and version of the bible haha. Well, if you nutjobs didn't know by now, there's never been any historical facts presented that 1. Moses even existed. 2. He got supernatural commanments from a supernatural being. 3. And lastly, there are zero evidence (except from being written in the bible) that jews walked for 40 years in any desert, nor that there existed any pharoah from Egypt who owed jewish slaves.So dear readers, in conclusion.. an objective and genuinly movie loving individual, who also loves and respect and love actual historical context - why would one even contemplate of watching this piece of crap of a movie, but also, not be disturbed by the ridiculously inaccurate tale of historical storytelling?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
205,Incendid,Underwhelming.,6,17 December 2014,"I am so very disappointed in Exodus: Gods and Kings, it could have have been an epic, just like the biblical epics of the 1950's, however it was not and it really fell short of what i was expecting. I expected more Sigourney Weaver instead she said two lines and sat in the background just looking at nothing, i expected more Aaron Paul instead he said one line and for the rest of the film, he communicated via eyebrows, i expected a duel between Moses and Rhamses, while two waves tower over them, instead they ran towards each other, stopped about 10 metres away from each other and had a conversation about the wave coming towards them. Also the film was 150 minutes long, which was way too short, i heard Ridley Scott say the film was originally meant to be about four hours long, yes, that's good, give me that version then the film might actually be awesome. Exodus: Gods and Kings is a mixed bag kind of a film, some elements such as Christian Bale as Moses are good, while, John Turturro as Seti was a terrible idea. The battle sequence at the beginning of the film was awesome, while the fight scene at the end of the film (sorry lack of) was horrible and underwhelming. The effects were great, the writing was just okay, the directing was great, the character development- rushed. Exodus: Gods and Kings could have been a really awesome film, and already parts of the film were awesome, as i said Ridley Scott did an excellent job directing the film, the casting choices of Christian Bale as Moses, Joel Edgerton as Rhamses and Ben Kingsley as Nun were all fantastic (because they all provided good performances). The costumes and visual effects were great, both did stumble a bit, in different parts of the film however that is forgivable, however something that isn't forgivable is the lack of run-time (this film really should have been four hours long) and the really sloppy writing.In conclusion, Exodus: Gods and Kings was an underwhelming 150 minute blockbuster that with some work and a longer runtime could have been an interesting and superb four hour epic. So Exodus: Gods and Kings receives a 6/10.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Don't fanny around with trying to make things logical and reasonable and scientific. What's needed are miracles with big M. The plagues...that bastion of Biblical Epics, were flaccid and looked more at home in a Wildebeest Migration documentary. Most disappointing of all was the 'Angel of Death' scene which was no Angel of Death but a mothership limp wristed shadow that cruised hither and yon, taking out all the firstborn with a sighing little catch in the throat. Compare that to Cecil B DeMille's Epic of Epics, the Ten Commandments where the same scene showed a Hammer Horror of a long fingered claw like Hand of God that dipped into the city with furtive, grave mist menace to strangle and smother amid screams and wails from grieving parents. The parting of the Red Sea was the final anticlimax. It didn't part so much as slither away as though embarrassed to be in the movie.

Next, the acting was not even mediocre, at best. Very clichéd and schlock ridden. Parts that should have been moving, once again, relied more on special effects than quality acting. To many new movies are doing this, especially ones they want to call ""blockbusters"". You'll have no more actors such as Charlton Heston, Tyrone Power, etc. You'll have to depend on actors that can't hold a candle to good ole fashioned acting. The movies depend more on the audience waiting to see the sea open up, things of that nature. So, combine bad acting, schlocky dialogue, and really poor quality of the movie itself and you have a movie really worth missing. Avoid this at all costs.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
208,xristoff93,Oops!Hollywood did it again!(spoilers),4,7 May 2015,"I give this movie a 5 only because I saw an effort in it.Not an effort that impressed me but still....I see there were a lot of money spent in this and for what? M for Moses...Moses appears as a war tactician,a cold blooded killer who would slaughter some guards just because he wasn't having a good day,a Moses who resembles Robin hood at some points,a Hebrew vigilante.God appears as spoiled,vengeful brat who gets to your nerves.The story was deviating a lot from the original.The actors were putting up a poor performance to say the least.At most points you wouldn't feel anything.It was as if the center of the movie were the visual effects,which OK,they were very good but that means nothing when the plot/script is so poorly written and the actors act worse than the protagonistσ in ""Spy kids"".The characters don't get any development and there are so many hand signs.What was that all about?Ramses was almost all the time absent minded or too troubled or seen doing chores like lighting lamps.For the love of god,he doesn't even walk on his own,he is a Pharaoh,why would you have him do that? In many cases reluctant or even cowering before moses.Besides them almost no other character gets any essential action in the movie. And I mean this is Ridley Scot.That part with the crocodiles in the river brought me tears from laughing so hard.COMEEEEE ON!!! All in all,low quality acting,no character development,bad script,very good visual effects but you get bored after the first 10 minutes.That awkward moment when Disney's movie is much better than this.....Hollywood wake up,stop making shitty movies or we'll stop paying to watch them.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
209,meelaleks,"Visually great, but with changed story and without a soul, sadly.",6,19 February 2019,"As a visual spectacle its a treat, really. 8 stars. So if you are not a Christian its entertaining. Else you are in for a shock: parts of the Biblical story are rewritten!
To a degree I can understand adding a few sideline stories and adding in the Bible unmentioned details, but altering the main character, Mozes, baffles me. In the book Mozes is humble in a way but Bale (a good actor) turned him into anything but that. He's a warlord kinda person. Worse, Bale played like if he hated the role. Hence his character feels hollow.
The pharao has a more interesting character but is depicted as a bit of a crazy madman. Why? Also puzzling: God is... a kid. Personally I can live with that chouce but weird it is.
And then there is the famous scene at the red sea. Its spiced up with a dozen tornados (luckely they left out flying sharks...) Oh and Mozes and Ramses have a sort of 1on1 standoff in the middle, seconds before the tsunami (!) hits and... both survive. Its downright crazy.
This could have been a great movie, now its pretty good fun, but only as simple entertainment without the Biblical perspective. If you count that in 4 stars would be the max.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
210,beorhouse,Plusses and Minuses,2,2 October 2017,"For the plusses: The Creator is shown to be the true God who is listened to while the gods worshiped by the Egyptians are deaf to their cries for help. Too, the CGI effects are fantastic to see and very realistic. For the negatives: primarily, the story does not follow the written record in the Bible. It does not matter whether you believe that written record is historical or not. You may believe it is purely fictional. Your opinion one way or another is insignificant. The fact is that we have four very ancient documents--the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy--that have inspired a number of films about Moses, and for this film those documents seem to have only been studied cursorily while the imaginations of the writer and director--and maybe even the actors themselves--were allowed to go off on tangents. Why not tell the story as it appears in the documents? Not freaky enough? Moses not tough-guy enough? Moses wasn't a tough guy. He was, and I paraphrase from the documents, the most humble man to ever walk to earth, speaking with God as a friend would speak with another friend. Where's his son's foreskin being smeared all over his feet by his wife Zipporah? Too graphic for a wide audience, I suppose. Why does his brother Aaron just stand there and not do what he is traditionally supposed to do, which is to speak for Moses whenever the latter has anything at all to say? I guess that would have taken the spotlight too far away from Bale. Where's Moses' powerful staff that can part waters and make the land between dry enough to walk across or coax much- needed water from a rock or turn into a serpent-swallowing serpent? Oh, I see. The snake-eating part of the story couldn't be explained as a natural occurrence like most of the plagues are. Maybe there was a natural chain reaction for the plagues. Very possible. Until, of course, we get to the blackness that covered Egypt when the Angel of the Lord (not seen in the film) killed all of the firstborn children and livestock of the families that did not cover their door-posts with the blood of unblemished lambs. Then the natural explanations sort of fall apart. Anyway, you see my point. There was some good stuff, but most of it was action film garbage. Bale plays a better Batman than a historical Hebrew leader who is seen by most Jews as a precursor to their idea of the Messiah and by all Christians as a primary archetype of Y'shua (Jesus) the Messiah. This is not to say that Charlton Heston was ever a great anything that he played, but at least Cecil B. DeMille made an attempt to follow the received documents. I give this one a 2 out of 10, but only because of the really great CGI effects. Guess that might show you in yet another way what I believe is the most important part of telling any story received from our ancestors and ancients.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This decision does not affect the quality of the movie for me.What the F^%! is happening to Ridley Scott!? First Prometheus, then The Counsellor, now this!? It's hard to believe the same guy who CHOSE to direct the scripts for Alien, Blade Runner, and GLADIATOR would think the script for Exodus was good enough to pass off as a decent movie (or maybe he didn't care?).Anyway, what you get with this movie is a pretty standard and predictable epic. If you're already familiar with the story of Moses and the Ten Plagues (or any other adaptation of this story), don't expect many surprises... The character development was weak. Although the relationship between Moses and Ramesses is fairly well-developed, I don't think I remember any of the other characters in this movie - probably with the exception of Joshua (I was like: Holy F^%!, it's Jesse Pinkman!!) and that one guy played by Ben Kingsley. The only reason why I even remember them is because I kept seeing the actors themselves, rather than the characters they were portraying. On a side note, the actor they got to portray God was not only unusual, but also very incredibly ANNOYING (both in the fact that they chose that actor AND in his acting). That being said, this movie's runtime of 2½ hours just DRAGS. There will be parts in here that will have you checking the time. But... when the spectacular action scenes do hit, you will BE satisfied (or wondering whether the wait was worth it or not).This is one of those movies that demands your full attention, but rewards you with little throughout. If you're either a HUGE fan of Ridley Scott or epic movies in general, I suggest you check it out. However, if you're looking for an engaging character-driven story with an exciting plot and even more exciting action sequences (like Gladiator), then watch something else (like Gladiator)....

A re-imagining of the The Ten Commandments, Exodus absolutely delivers on a what it set out to do. Its structure is similar to Gladiator with a grand opening battle at the beginning, which is truly immersive when viewed in 3D. Ridley continues to state that he is the contemporary master of Historical Epic movies.The movie creates a time travel experience to ancient Egypt like never before. All actors deliver excellent performances however, i felt that Sigourney Weaver and Aaron Paul were tremendously under used. Exodus does stay true, for the most part, to what's in the bible however, the parting of the red sea was anti climatic and it came across as more of a coincidental natural disaster than an actual miracle perform by God.I notice some reviews on here complaining of how slow and boring the film is. I must say the movie is being sold on ""from the director of Gladiator,"" which is to say Gladiator was pretty slow and so does every Ridley Scott movie ever made. Ridley demands more from his audience and he's one of the few directors who refuses to be rushed into the fast paced saturated movie zeitgeist. Whether you believe in the bible or not Exodus is still a great stand alone dramatized biblical interpretation. It's the best bible movie ever made so far.

One could question having Bale in the leading role, and based on this result with good reason. Unlike Scott's other epic the Kingdom of Heaven, memorable verbal exchanges between the characters, are non existent or any good. Having quality C G I effects simply cannot hold flimsy screenplay together.

So Christian Bale is not brown skinned.I felt,nevertheless,he did a great job as Moses.(Moshe)Some of the maids in the palace were non Caucasians and many of the Egyptian soldiers were also non white. Oh yes,crocodiles were part of the plagues which is not written in the Old Testament.So what? This is Hollywood.Even scholars of the Old Testament and researchers in Egyptology do not agree on all the biblical writings.The main story was told very realistically and maybe with a unique interpretation. But nothing took away from the brilliant special effects.I would have appreciated a more striking and powerful scene when Moses received the Ten Commandments from God. You must see this movie in 3D.I felt as though I were inside the chariots racing along the desert sands to stop Moses and his people from leaving for Canaan. God is portrayed as a young boy.His name could not be said,only ""I Am"" because God is too spiritual to be seen or have his name spoken.True,it is a different take on the original movie,but still very powerful.I think Charlton Heston would approve.I found Moses to be very emotional in the movie as was his step brother Ramses. The plagues were totally amazingly portrayed.The visuals in this movie including the land of Egypt in 1300 BCE, and the plagues,especially the Shadow of Death enveloping the country were breathtaking.For a complete movie immersion and not forgetting that this isn't a religious production,you will be totally entertained.The 3D effects were worth seeing above all else.Run,don't walk to this entertaining,informative movie this holiday season.Imagine,no sex and not too gory violence in a movie today.

215,ETO_Buff,Alternate Interpretation of Previous Exodus Films,4,28 December 2015,"I checked the spoiler box in case this is read by someone that hasn't seen the film and has never seen or read the story of Moses and the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. This film began with a lot of potential. The acting is excellent, the sets and costumes are stunning, and the story seemed to be accurate. Then it degraded into just another Hollywood attempt to separate God from Biblical events via a screenwriter's reinterpretation of previous films about Moses and the Exodus. As such, this one also portrays Moses and the Egyptians not knowing that Moses is a Hebrew until shortly before he departs Egypt. This is a fallacy that was introduced by Cecil B. DeMille in his first ""Ten Commandments"" film in 1923. He repeated the error in 1956, and every film, except one, since then have just copied his version of the story instead of having writers actually reading the book of Exodus. This film has God represented by the personage of a young boy, for some reason, and Moses, instead of being a reluctant, but obedient prophet, argues with God and is completely oblivious to the plagues that are inflicted upon the Egyptians until he sees them happening. Aaron's role is also reduced to that of an observer instead of the faithful voice of Moses to Pharaoh. Contrary to the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea on dry ground as described in the Bible and correctly portrayed by DeMille, this one has them wading out into knee-deep water at the beginning of the crossing. These are just a couple of examples of the many problems with this film. People who enjoy alternate versions of history will probably enjoy this film much more than those who believe in the Biblical narrative as written by Moses.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
216,gogarrett,Large canvas with no emotional detail,7,15 December 2014,"Pluses were the fantastic spectacle, the sets, the props, the costumes. I guess the music was fine, but I don't remember it two days later. I didn't think Christian Bale's acting was that bad and Ramses acting was much better than I expected. The story did not follow the Bible very closely - but then, my head kept comparing everything to ""The Ten Commandments"" with Charlton Heston, which threw in characters which did not exist in the Bible also. I love Ben Kingsley, but why was his character there? Just because having Kingsley in the movie would make everything seem more believable or weighty? I also disliked seeing Sigourney Weaver going to waste in this movie. It is such a tease to have her there and yet only give her a couple lines. My favorite character was the dying Pharaoh, although he and his family would have been more convincing if of a darker hue. He expressed the truest emotion in the entire movie, with his love for Moses and disappointment in his own son. I also liked the ""gay""? Viceroy but don't remember him at all from the Bible or other variations of this story. He got a juicy part though. I was not happy with the choice to show God as a scolding child. This Moses did not show the range of emotions he should have, which could have happened if he had truly converted to belief in the ""God of the Jews"". He was their leader and yet I could not sense he was a true believer himself. He seemed to maintain self-absorption throughout the movie. The Aaron character could have been expanded upon. Perhaps it is silly of me to want the story to more closely resemble the one told in the Bible. The Bible did tell a great story though, as it was written. It was full of action, tragedy, redemption, emotional impact, well developed characters, fantastic storyline, etc. What was the true focus of this movie? Moses as General - War Hero of the Jews, rather than leader and liberator of the Jews and mouthpiece of God in his time.

218,Wrapper30,Entertaining Hokum,8,30 December 2014,I watched this after suffering through Noah on Christmas Day and was pleasantly surprised. Very well acted and well paced biblical epic which was very entertaining. Yes there are a few historical and factual errors in the story but are we not entertained? Bale is his usual broody menacing self and Egerton is excellent as an almost ashamed villain. The angst he suffers whilst exiling Moses is well done although Sigourney Weaver is underused as his unpleasant mother. The idea of God as a 10 year old boy works well in my eyes as it is different from the usual booming voice and guise of an old man. The plagues could have been explained better and given greater clarity. Ewen Bremner's character could perhaps been used more in this respect. Maybe a little long but overall very entertaining as a modern biblical epic and vastly superior to the hilariously bad Noah.,Exodus - Gods and Kings

I sat through this film feeling real sympathy for the pharaoh and bordering on dislike for Moses. And that is not the story I remember from childhood! The creation of God as a petulant child takes away any respect you have for his commands. Yes, you see the fact that the Isralites are slaves but the pharaoh has been made so human that instead of wanting his downfall, the viewer is shocked that Moses, a man brought up as his brother, can be actively involved in the destruction of every aspect of his life. Even the old pharaoh is shown as a 'nice guy' and I'm sure he was pretty horrendous in the original stories! Maybe these Old Testament stories do not translate in a modem world, maybe it was the writing. I was not, however, cheering on Moses throughout.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
222,BecauseIAmBATMAN,"Visually Magnificent, yet a flawed and incomplete Epic",6,7 December 2014,"Let me start by saying that I am not a Christian and I have never read the Bible. So coming from someone who is unaware of the Source material, I found the story interesting. Exodus: Gods and Kings is a visually magnificent story and entertaining overall. The Acting by Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton was excellent. The plague scenes were beautifully done and were the best part of the film. In-spite of these positives it feels flawed and incomplete.The editing was poorly done which affected the pacing of the film at times. It is pretty apparent that this wasn't Scott's final vision of the film but a heavily cut one. You might get the feeling that the film is incomplete. This film also lacks an emotional punch. While the characters certainly some depth to them, we never connect to them on an emotional level. Aaron Paul and Sigourney Weaver are wasted in the film. These cons are something I believe might be rectified in the 4 hour final cut Ridley promised. Watch this film on screen for the magnificent visuals. 6.5/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings
223,bob-larrance,The Biblical epic updated for your pleasure,7,5 March 2015,"A movie need not be a mirror that you gaze into to somehow discover your own soul, the human condition or much of anything at all. It is quite alright to watch a movie for a little harmless entertainment. Ah, but there are those of our species that wish each event could be crafted to teach a lesson, or right a wrong or bend the mind of the uneducated to a certain point of view. They are happiest when they exert a little control over you, citizen! Those people just bore me to tears.I found this to be an enjoyable 'Biblical Epic' type of film with above average acting, cinematography and direction. I believe that if a person has two hours to spend and wants a little diversion this will do. It is a work that represents the 'spectacular' genre these days and is well worth the time and rental fee.On the other hand, if a person wants historical accuracy they should probable seek out a documentary and cross their fingers – the era handled by Scott isn't all that well known and there is much disagreement about the Jewish migration out of Egypt. At the time, nobody was taking pictures or tweeting about the experience. As a result, almost all we know about that time is either speculation or mythology or both. (Those that argue about the 'accuracy of this movie really tickle me.) Of course, this movie deals with religious topics. You already knew that I bet. If you are going to watch Exodus for religious reasons look out! If you are really devout, you will find it weak. If you are without religion, you will find it too strong. If you practice the faith of Rameses you will no doubt be offended. Happy entrails to you.Ff you like to get your religion from someplace other than from a Ridley Scott movie you will be OK on the faith issue. I was neither converted nor offended.And, if you are looking for cinema that will either reaffirm your political beliefs or teach you something really, really deep then bypass this. It is a movie, not some sort of brain add-on that will make you a better person or symbolically pat you on the back for being so accurate, either left or right, in your politics.Chris Bale is good as Moses. I know, easy for me to say (I never met Moses) but I think he is good. Bale's character develops and grows as the story goes on and though he's a little young I can buy him as the patriarch. Joel Edgerton is a good Rameses. No, he isn't Egyptian by birth. But, he is all the Rameses I looked forward to and he's appropriately cruddy when the need arises. Pharaohs are a spoiled bunch and Joel conveys that quality well. Maria Valverde is effective in her role as Mrs. Moses. She is a model, by the way, and a woman that is skilled at appearing glamorous. Ben Kingsley gets to play the Ben Kingsley part. I really have no problems with his casting and he does his version of Ben Kingsley quite well.Several of the named talents have very small, insignificant roles. That is too bad for them, I am sure. But there screen time doesn't harm the movie.The more spectacular elements of the story are done well. Plagues, parting waters, theological discussions with you-know-who, all pulled off skillfully. Sex is quite muted (less than pre-Hayes stuff)and the gore isn't all that gory (for the most part) so I think it is OK for the kiddies. This isn't history a la Pasolini.Way back then things were probably quite rotten for many of the residents. This movie shows the conditions without bleeding all over the screen. I think that is a plus. But the sense of struggle for an oppressed minority is effectively conveyed.In short a rather good movie! If you wish, you can believe those that would rather (ahem) make your thoughts their concern to the point that they direct your behavior. Or, you can trust good old me, I promise that for a modern day Old Testament epic this one is dandy.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
224,patbradley435,Garbage in the extreme,1,28 December 2014,"Where do I begin? This movie is a total train wreck. It is an insult to any cinema-goer and definitely the worst biblical movie ever committed to film.The script is truly abysmal, the dialogue awful, as well as the acting from Christian Bale and Ben Kingsley. Awful, just awful. Ridley Scott needs to refocus, take some time off and reconsider his career as a top film maker, because he certainly isn't after this disaster. Did he actually have advisers on this turkey. Actually, turkey is a good expression for this movie since it was released at Christmas time, allowing people to digest it and rid themselves of it the next day through natural functions. I thought Noah was a terrible movie, but in comparison to Exodus it is a cinematic triumph! I could eat alphabeti spaghetti and the next day produce a better script than Exodus. IMDb should allow negative ratings, and this one would definitely receive many. I think in the future people will have parties where they will watch this movie and laugh at it, just as they did with Plan 9 From Outer Space. However, Plan 9 is a much better movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
225,SandeepLoyalka,Mostly disappointing!,5,6 December 2014,"Having always loved Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Ten Commandments', I was quite looking forward to Ridley Scott's version of the story. Scott is a director I admire, & one who can never be faulted for a lack of vision. The trailers looked impressive & the cast even more so - Christian Bale, Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro, Joel Edgerton. On seeing the film however, I have to admit at being disappointed. There ARE things to like in it - the opening battle against a rampaging Hittite army is stunningly staged, & the climactic parting of the Red Sea - despite the generous use of CGI - is quite a spectacle. It's everything in between that's a bit of a problem. The friendship & rivalry between Moses & Ramses - so well depicted in the DeMille epic - is barely developed here. Consequently, one is never emotionally invested in the proceedings. Also, the film moves at a snail's pace. Despite being over an hour shorter than the 1956 version, it feels as long. Never a good sign! Scott goes for a gritty, real feel, & his depiction of Egypt circa 1300 BC is far removed from DeMille's sanitised, colourful version. Talented actors like Kingsley, Weaver & Turturro barely get adequate screen time, though Bale & Edgerton make the most of their substantial roles. Bale is particularly good as the conflicted Hebrew leader, torn between the Godly visions he sees, & his own wavering mind. Edgerton, who could so easily have gone OTT, is adequately restrained & thankfully downplays the tormented Pharaoh. The production design is excellent, but the abundance of CGI was a bother - though that's an issue with most films nowadays. Overall, the film should work better with those not familiar with - or fond of - the older movie. Also, going in with lowered expectations would probably help.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
226,Man-Behind-The-Pen,Nice Fantasy,1,16 March 2017,"I watched Gods of Egypt and it was actually a very nice mythological story with a modern take on it. Then I watched Exodus: Gods and Kings The story is often taken as history with only the bible claiming that Exodus did happen. I dispute this movie as historical, because there is NO historical evidence that Exodus ever happened and that Jews were ever slaves in Egypt. Abrahamic religions have perfected martyrdom and playing the victim card in order to weasel their way into people's lives and take over their essence. Story of Exodus is nothing more than propaganda and any and all religious movies are to be viewed as propaganda and NOT history. It never happened. Anyone taking the bible stories to be true without actual evidence, just because the bible said it is in my opinion a willful ignoramus and is intellectually dishonest.As for Ben Kingsley, he seems to be playing Jew roles very well. The whole movie mediocre if you forget that it is another biblical cow dung put on the big screen.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The background of Moses is shown in a different way, having the director filling the blanks of the Bible.

228,maue-19674,Ridley Scott's modern Re-telling of a Biblical Tale,7,8 February 2021,"As someone who recognises Ridley Scott as a force in Cinema and a fan of many of his Films, I have to say that 'Exodus: Gods & Kings' is not among his best. Scott has decided to modernise the Biblical tale in ways that make the entire story more 'plausible' to a modern audience. Thus, he starts with the Battle of Kadesh to give the film an exciting opening before moving on to the Moses/Ramses face off and the well known aftermath. Religious purists criticised the Film for 'inaccuracy' and changing the 'known facts' of the story - absolutely astounding thinking as the Bible is not an 'Historical Document' and, indeed, there is no mention of a 'Moses' in any surviving texts of the time. Even the idea that the Hebrew slaves 'built the Pyramids' etc is now seriously in doubt as Archaeologists can find no evidence at all for this assertion. Even the inclusion that the pharaoh referred to was Ramses II is a total guess as the name is never quoted in the biblical texts.
Leaving aside the source material, the Film looks fantastic - ancient Egypt looks fabulous and the cinematography is superb. All of the main sequences are well done but the entire Film suffers from a curious lack of emotion and connection. The Cast does it's best - Christian Bale tries to convey Moses as more of a rebel leader than a spiritual one and Joel Edgerton struggles with the role of Ramses. The real issue here is that the Script does allow the two main protagonists to really gel. I do give credit to Scott for attempting to make the tale more realistic for today's audiences but for a number of reasons this film doesn't quite work as well as it should.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

230,keithbrown-90195,Shiny but Passionless,4,11 September 2016,"What a slog. When you adapt the bible and remove all the fantastical in an attempt to make it more 'realistic', you lose all sense of wonder and it becomes something akin to watching a history lesson. As the most personal book in human history, this adaptation feels strangely impersonal, as if the filmmakers had no love or attachment to the story, no real reason for wanting to make it. Since I have no personal connection to the story, it just became a chore seeing this play out. I doubt even a believer would be taken with this adaptation.Trying to recreate the success of Gladiator, Ridley Scott has turned ancient Egypt into a civilization with shiny new monuments and elaborate costumes, and a chanting choir on the soundtrack to add some drama to the proceedings. The plagues that descend upon the Egyptians are given real world explanations, and shot in ways that undermine the attempts at ambiguity with Moses and his visions/hallucinations of a boy god.i liked the score during those scenes with god, and the parting of the red sea has some thrilling moments, but this really doesn't believe in itself.Also, it felt longer than the 150 minutes.

231,azcoppen,"Just add 300 more horses, or something",3,19 December 2014,"No wonder the critics hate this film.Someone needs to sit down and have a very honest conversation with Ridley Scott. Along the lines of: ""you can add all the horses you want, but if your story sucks, eventually the audience slowly get that your whole film just sucks"". I can't remember seeing so many people drip out of a cinema one by one over 2 hours.This disaster is what happens when closet Humanist types decide to ""polish"" up what is already one of the greatest stories of all time by removing the central theme (err, God). When the Bible is given the Hollywood treatment, everyone loses: humanists, naturalists and atheists look cynically manipulative (and/or ignorant), entire audiences are lost because it deviates from the original (rightly or wrongly), and everyone else is just standing there wondering why Hollywood is yet again hoping the spectacle will make up for the lack of substance. The only thing worse is Christian filmmaking.Whoever came up with the idea of representing God as a psychotic, vengeful 10 year old boy from a Japanese horror who drinks tea, isn't actually there, and gets moral lectures from Moses, is an idiot, pure and simple. It's creepy at best, and offensively cynical at the other end of the scale. Likewise for the ""brotherhood"" narrative that ends in a needless tsunami stand-off without any authentic emotion whatsoever. At least he didn't utter the horrifically awful ""i'll do what i have to do to protect my family"". Just plain bad ideas where the ""drama"" is laughably phoney. You can almost here the development execs berating the writers' room to ""add more conflict"", ""change it to be a saga of 2 brothers"", ""put in a love subplot"", etc, etc, ad nauseam.More interesting angles the 4 (yes, FOUR) screenwriters might have looked at, if they'd put down their conceit and taken a few weeks to speak to a Rabbi/historian or two in advance:A people enslaved for 400 years were conditioned and beaten down into helplessness, never having even known anywhere else other than Egypt - not a 1949 Palestine terrorist militia in training. Moses' story is of constant struggle to lead a people who continually turned their back on him.-Moses was so enthusiastic to lead a revolution that he cold-bloodiedly murdered an Egyptian guard - not a ""faithless"" man needing to be convinced, or the calmest guy in the room.He was also so badly-spoken that Aaron had to speak for him, making his leadership extremely mysterious - not a highly articulate philosopher type.Pharaoh was a bloodthirsty, unbelievably stubborn man who ruled the known world, and was being humbled into submission - not a cutesy brother with daddy issues;The Hebrews were kicked out so fast under such unbelievable pressure that they got to leave with the contents of the Treasury - not just slovenly marched out in rags;Women were possessions, and religious belief was all-encompassing, not some philosophically-liberal free-for-all where relationships were Dr Phil sessions.The death of the first born was carried out - so the story goes - by the unbelievably terrifying idea of the Angel of Death, not some eclipse shadow: WAY more imagination- provoking. The plagues weren't Starbucks coffees that finished after 5 minutes: the suffering was horrific.He led a journey he never finished, started when they didn't know where they were going, didn't want to go, and had no hope for: one that took 40 years of wandering in circles for no reason.Why point these things out? You could literally have taken almost any of those points from the classic, with its phenomenal story - whether you have a Judeo-Christian world-view or not - and made it a more interesting and challenging dramatic story that the development tards here ended up writing. The historical character of Moses is 10,000x more interesting as-is, compared to this American Hero template.And as visually fantastic as Scott's epic's almost always are (if you don't count the disastrous casting in other spoiled gems like Kingdom of Heaven), no amount of sandals or sweeping landscape shots is ever going to fully make up for the fact that your story and its character don't work like homoeopathy, in that they don't get more profound the more diluted they are.There's an old Hollywood adage - a desperately thirsty writer and a producer are in the desert sitting about to drink from the only water puddle for hundreds of miles. The producer unzips his fly and starts urinating in it. ""What are you doing????"", the writer asks. ""Making it better"", the producer replies. You can't polish a turd, but you can take a diamond and cover it in turd.If there is a lack of character development, story compulsion, or even emotion: it's simply because the team behind it either a) didn't actually read the source, or b) never *got* the intensity of what they were reading. I'm inclined to believe it was b), and still is.

The criticism that points at how this is not ""historically accurate"" may want to revise their position since the bible is not a history book. Yes, the story how it happens departs from the bible but all in all it reflects it very well. In particular the relation between God and Moses. Some critics are upset because God is represented like a ""spoilt brat"", but the God of exodus in the bible is a spoilt brat hell bent on vengeance. Perhaps it doesn't come out in all the translations but he did ""hardened the heart"" of the Pharao so that he could send more plagues.

It was devastatingly boring when you consider the ""story"" that was it's source material that is an almost impossible feat.Ridley Scott has made some of the best movies I have ever seen including Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator. Mr. Scott has had his failures but this movie bears the title of Epic only because it is an example of Epic Failure. I don't know if anyone who was connected with the writing or production of this movie ever even glanced at the story. The depiction of God as some nasty little kid who sounds like he is doing an imitation of Jason Statham in Transporter was ludicrous.I actually expected that at some point he would tell Christian Bale to just call him ""Frank"" instead of ""I Am"". They did this movie in 1956 and the role of Ramses was played by Yul Bryner. Mr.Bryner looked like a God with a physical appearance that was terrifying. The dude was ripped and looked amazing. Bryner(look him up) was a former circus acrobat and played scary cruel better than anyone ever has. This current Ramses looked like he's lived on a diet of macaroni and cheese with extra bacon bits his entire life. His flabby face and body made me nauseous as well as his grammar school level acting ability only further detracting from his histrionic portrayal. Christian Bale, one of my favorite actors of this generation, was equally awful as I watched his strange Don Draper haircut prevail as his beard changed from scene to scene. The ponderous score was intensely annoying. The endless scenes of people running blindly doing God knows what were a horror.The Israelites are engaged in some kind of guerrilla warfare where they were apparently able to enlist the aide of the Nile Crocodiles to help produce one of the plagues was reminiscent of Sharknado. Now lets get to Charleton Heston. HESTON WAS MOSES! Bale was running around with some weird ornate golden sword instead of a staff which is an integral to the original story while he was riding a horse WITH WESTERN STIRRUPS (not used in any form in this area until at least 1200 years later). Bale, despite the suggestion of his Father-in-Law,apparently never heeded his suggestion to bathe. This movie was a failure on every level. Acting, Direction, Writing, Musical Scoring and even the Photography was appallingly bad.Moses's wife was attractive and also had the ability to never age between her insipid acting attempts despite the passage of many years.This movie also showed how the special effects were BETTER in 1956 I paid to see this movie,four plus hours of my life I will never get back (I had to rewind it when I dozed off several times) and at age 63 I can not abide the loss of any more precious time.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
235,ZChrisJ1995,"An acceptable, but not outstanding, modern Biblical epic",7,8 December 2014,"The second film this year to provide a revamped action-oriented take on a Biblical story after Darren Aronofsky's ""Noah"", ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" maintains Ridley Scott's strong dedication to visually impressive set-pieces, while also unfortunately continuing his recent reliance on average writing and plot structure. ""Gods and Kings"" seems to take a more historically and geographically accurate approach to the Exodus story, presenting supposedly miraculous events in a more realistic manner, with massive parting walls of water being replaced by receding tides, etc. This may irritate certain religious groups, but events such as the Ten Plagues, as well as Moses' (Christian Bale) early siege on a Hittite army, are all still highly captivating and visually stunning sequences. Though the dynamic between Moses and Ramesses (Joel Edgerton) could have been explored in more depth, especially in regards to their childhood and youth, which is unfortunately not depicted, both actors still give it their all, ensuring that their deep rivalry is captured strongly. While not ranking as Bale's strongest role (he works better in smaller productions such as ""The Machinist"" and ""The Fighter""), he is still a solid Moses, though perhaps not as brilliant as Charlton Heston's depiction of the character. Joel Edgerton is also commendable in his role as the Pharaoh, clearly having a blast as the sadistic uber-dictator. Though the two key characters are great, a large percentage of the supporting cast feel either criminally underused or horribly miscast, and sometimes both. Though Sigourney Weaver and Aaron Paul have impressive portfolios, they receive barely any speaking lines, and even when they do you can't help but feel that there were many other capable actors who would have better suited the roles. The film tends to meander and slow down around its prolonged second act, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if the film had a better screenplay. This, however, is redeemed largely by Bale, who remains engrossing to watch. Though let down in certain parts by some poor casting decisions and some weak writing, ""Exodus: Gods and Kinds"" is still a worthwhile experience, with the performances of its two leads and a gorgeous visual style redeeming some of these flaws. It's definitely not Ridley Scott's best film, but it's certainly not his worst.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

But my feelings towards it did not impact my opinion on the movie, as a movie. As a story and a technical achievement etc. etc. etc. I judged the film purely on its own merits, and how I felt about the actual content. And the actual content bored the Hell out of me. Ridley Scott has had highs and lows and various middle-grounds in between, but he hasn't helmed a project I've truly LOVED in fifteen years, and that concerns me. Any other director I would have long given up on, but for some reason I keep drinking the Ridley-Kool-Aid and I keep being disappointed. The problem is, there's not a soul in the cinema-going world who doesn't intimately know the story of Moses inside and out since childhood, so there's no surprises to be had from beginning to end. Maybe if they brought a fresh twist to it, or maybe if they did every single part of the tale the best it had ever been done, then maybe we'd have a worthwhile endeavour on our hands, but instead Exodus just sort of... is. The Abrahamic religions' mythology just by and large isn't as exciting as the others'. And here we see the story of God's primary prophet, who's greatest achievement is moving water from one spot to another so he can run away better. Impressive to an extent sure, but we've been spoiled by Gods like Thor and Darkseid in the zeitgeist this past decade, so I guess bizarrely casted wait-around marathons just don't impress me as much as they might have in say, when The Ten Commandments came out which covers the same junk in 45 minutes as Exodus in TWO AND A HALF HOURS and that was NEARLY A CENTURY AGO. There's plenty of things I didn't hate about Exodus, sure, but there's nothing to really like either, which for a story that was already retold to death before even the advent of film, just won't cut it. It's been done so many times before, it's been done better before, and with the exception of one crocodile-related scene in about the middle, it's not worth your time. Because again. It's two and a half hours, and that is A LOT of your time for ""sort of okay"".",Exodus - Gods and Kings
239,barbb1953,Future audiences will appreciate this hugely,7,8 September 2015,"There are a lot of disappointed reviews here and the film didn't do that well at the box office, but I think this version of the exodus out of Egypt will stand the test of time for its exploration of what it means to be a Jew, as well as for Bale's performance, which drew me in despite my initial lack of interest (somebody I know was watching the DVD). I checked it out, wanting to compare it to the 1960s epics that I'm familiar with, and Bale turned Moses into a relatable human being for me.Much better than the Sixties-style Hollywood epics (though I enjoy those for the spectacle).There was also that bit of dialogue that summed up the general thrust: being Hebrew means ""wrestling with God"" rather than ""chosen of God,"" it was explained. The interactions of Moses and the child (which, incidentally, summed up this Buddhist's view of the god in question better than any I've seen on film) were the most obvious form of wrestling, but it was a many-layered presentation in which several lesser-billed characters and unnamed extras did wonderful work.Finally, it may take years before people can see how much Scott has reflected our current culture in the subtext to ""Exodus."" That's a brave move on his part - such awareness is not at all popular right now. I especially enjoyed the Expert.This movie also made me realize how monolithic and ""dead-god""-like post-Sixties western society today is.I took two points off. The CGI was awesome but impersonal (big problem in many movies) everywhere but the end sequence crossing the Dead Sea. Then - SPOILER - Moses got hit by the wave and Ramses survived. I like the traditional version better.But the ending was perfect, absolutely perfect, and so was Bale in that last scene (he didn't say a single word...and no word needed to be said. The man is a master, and so is the director).",Exodus - Gods and Kings
240,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,Interesting and Spectacular - a work of art!,8,21 December 2014,"I loved it for all the good it has. It's an upgrade to the older versions of Exodus—very spectacular and it makes an effort to take the audience into an authentic experience of 1300 BCE. Yes, it is imperfect, but it's interesting and stimulating. It's a film that puts questions in your mind that you want to find answers for. Overall, this movie fulfills the promise of action, adventure, disaster/science fiction, and drama, all within an imperfect biblical framework. Most of this movie, over 60%, is about the plagues, battles, and the parting of the sea. The one emotional thread you will find is the romantic life of Moses—it is sweet, it is filled with poetry. The brief romance is a lovely contrast with the rest of the movie, it adds balance. There's also the relationship between the two brothers, Moses and Ramses, but this is not explored as much. Pretty much, the focus of Ridley Scott is on the justice brought up by God over the reluctant Pharaoh by means of pseudo-natural disasters. Exodus will delight your senses with the amazing special effects and the realistic details and settings built for the movie. You will feel like a time-machine traveler for the 2 hours-plus of the movie. One thing you might not find satisfying is the lack of the Supernatural about God. Well, God is supernatural. So Scott lowers the Supernatural ""volume"" as much as possible, but that's the angle he wants for this movie. And also, the portrayal of God is a little strange, but interesting. After all, God can manifest himself however he wants—he's the creator! The one thing that has a more supernatural feeling, is the angel of death sequence (quite emotional too). Regarding the characters,Christian Bale's Moses is very much human--a warrior and a smart man with great challenges. Christian Bale puts such emotion and realism in his character. He gets all sweaty and dirty. You can feel his anxiety,his doubt, his anger, his fear. He fights with God. In turn, Joel Edgerton's Ramses is a rebel, punk, irreverent, cynical, a ""gum-chewing"" indolent that later becomes insatiable for power and glory. The confrontation between the two brothers adds an additional dramatic layer to the movie. Let's be forgiving here, shall we? Sure, there are inaccuracies. Sure, Scott omitted and added things for the sake of the story he wanted to tell. But let's focus on the important things: Hollywood's intention, albeit imperfect, of bringing the Bible and God to the general public. If the supernatural had been more relevant, and the story had been more focused and in track with the scriptures, it would have been loved by all audiences.Give it a chance.Enjoy.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
241,B RUBBLE,"Not as good as Cecil B, DeMille's version",6,6 January 2015,"While I liked the movie overall, I felt that it fell well short of the ""Ten Commandments"" version done by Cecil B. DeMille. I do not think the main characters were as good as Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner, nor were any of the supporting cast as good as the ""cast of thousands"" in the ""10 Commandments"". There was not as much interaction between Moses and Ramses as depicted by DeMille. I expected the Special Effects to be quite an advance over ""10 Commandments"", but even those fell short of expectations. In addition, the narration that Cecil B. DeMille did at times in ""10 Commandments"" kept viewers apprised as to what time elapsed between some events and what was happening. None of that in this film. I see why this film has left most theaters in this area so soon. Obviously not a hit with enough people to keep it around with so many other and better films out now.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
242,julian-640-544058,Don't be tricked...this has nothing to do with the bible!,2,14 March 2015,"The 2 stars are for the acting and the filmography and that is it. I personally found the reference to the Bible to be offensive, since this story (and I do mean story) was unlike any version of Exodus that I have seen.For example: ************spoiler alert**************** 1. In every Bible I have seen (Jewish, Catholic, King James etc), Moses approaches the Pharaoh before the plagues and warns him what will happen if he does not set the Jews free. Here Moses approaches the Pharaoh only after the last plague has ended and his son is dead. In fact, Moses turning Aaron's staff to a snake is never mentioned in the film.2. In the Bible, each of the plagues is initiated by Aaron raising his staff, here Moses is as surprised as the Pharaoh when each plague come, and Aaron plays no part at all.3. In the movie, Moses gets lost when trying to get everyone to the Red Sea.4. I have no idea where the writer got the idea that the God appeared to Moses as an arrogant 10 year old serving him tea.5. The burning bush in the movie is little more then background art and the little brat gives Moses the commandments.And I could go on.It is disgraceful how Hollywood continues to bastardize and mutate religions. This is another example of what what I believe to be and intentional policy of misrepresenting and mocking beliefs that many hold sacred.Bottom line, is you want an fantasy movie that has some reasonable acting and decent scenery and effects, then this is for you...If you are looking for a story that even remotely resembles the book of Exodus from the Bible, then look elsewhere.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
243,Sahl_95,Visually Great. Not Much Else.,7,26 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is about Moses (Christian Bale) and Ramses (Joel Edgerton) and the uprising of the Hebrew slaves against Egypt.Visually, this movie was fantastic. The opening battle scene was brilliant. The plagues were intense and exciting to watch. The look of ancient Egypt was great to see. And the parting of the sea was epic. Pretty much loved the movie visually.As for the story, the beginning was great. I enjoyed watching the relationship between Ramses and Moses. Unfortunately there isn't much of it later in the movie (apart from one scene). I felt the movie would have been better with more screen time for those two to explore their deteriorating relationship . The middle part when Moses is exiled felt quite slow and didn't keep me interested and took until the arrival of the plagues to hook me back. From there I enjoyed the rest of the movie. Another thing I did not like was how Moses went from a sceptic to a believer (although I did like the fact he did not believe blindly).I felt Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton were great in their roles. However, the supporting cast didn't really do much for me. Apart from a couple, they didn't do a whole lot.This movie was still enjoyable to an extent, but I felt it could have been much better.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The horribly miscast actors are going through the motions, the cinematography is murky and ugly, and that goes for the CG special effects too.This film is symptomatic of how misguided modern Hollywood is.

247,tan1415,Unfair criticism...most underrated movie,10,13 January 2015,"Unfair criticism makes me very cautious of the movie.Quite a few people have not seen the movie yet. can't blame them after the NOAH debacle. But this is a MUST SEE move. If you are an action, a history buff or wants to see a different kind of biblical story.I can very much assure that you will not be disappointed by this movie. Matter of fact...IMHO it's even better than The Hobbit 3 or even Gladiator. Definitely better than the original Kingdom of Heaven. If there is a directors cut of this movie like with koH...it will be even better.Ridley Scott delivered a quite unique movie. A biblical themed action movie. I guess is more a based on movie than an actual refilming of the biblical story. Even though he is not following the biblical story 100%...all essential elements are in it. I bet in a Directors cut...more of the original stories will be fleshed out. like the breaking of the 10 commandments.Moses is my favorite prophet from the old testament and exodus one of my favorite stories. I really like how Christian Bale seems to capture moses. Sure he is not as (melo)dramatic as Charlton Heston. But his style works. Especially his arguments with the child god speaks to me. he was not a blind follower but argued to. I liked that. Because lets face it...when the plagues are quite graphically and the impact is truly stunning. The movie conveyed how disastrous it all was.I also love how the whole grandeur of the Egyptian culture and the battle scenes are Truly impressive. Ridley Scott has outdone Peter Jackson and even himself from KoH and Gladiator. It was so realistic.Let me discuss some critiques of the movie.1) To many white/Caucasian actors. That's a silly argument. As far as i know...Charlton Heston is 100% Caucasian. 2) More local actors. That's equally silly. Maybe can use them as extras. But come it's 3000 years on.if you ignore the address where they live, I bet the locals in Egypt are as different to ancients Egyptians as the Caucasians are. Everyone of the actors and actresses acted faultlessly. Even Turturro as Seti.3)Historical inaccuracies. Well it's noticeable for history buffs. But didn't really distract to the story. Like I said above..|Ridley Scott made ancient Egypt come alive like he did with Ancient Rome in Gladiator.4) he didn't exactly follow the Biblical story. I think a directors cut with more minutes would do the story justice. But his artistic choices doesn't bother me. To me this is a biblical action movie.Anyway if you have not seen the movie yet. Run to the nearest cinema. This movie in all of its magnificence deserves to be enjoyed in the cinema. You will be in awe of the world building and the battle scenes.I loved it. And I wonder how it will look if i see it more.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
248,mr-abarton,Average,5,30 December 2014,"Its 1300 BCE and Moses,(Christian Bale) a member of the royal family is preparing along with Prince Ramesses,(Joel Egerton) to go to war with the Hittite Army. Ramesses's Father, Seti, (John Turturro) tells them both of a prophecy in which it's said that one of them is destined to save the life of the other and become leader.The prophecy seems to come true, as Moses ends up saving Ramesses from certain death on the battlefield, leaving them both somewhat troubled. Moses goes to the city of Pithom and meets Hegep, (Ben Mendelsohn) who is over all the Hebrew slaves and finds himself disgusted by the conditions they're living in. Whilst there, he is told of his Hebrew parents and learns how he was sent as a child ,by his sister Miriam, (Tara Fitzgerald) to be raised by the Pharaoh's daughter. Two Hebrew's had been eaves dropping outside and rush to inform Hegep of their discovery.Shortly after Moses returns to Memphis, Seti dies and Ramesses takes his place as the new Pharaoh. Hegep arrives in Memphis and reveals Moses's true identity to Ramesses, who finds it difficult to accept. However, Ramesses questions the servant girl Miriam and threatens to cut off her arm, if she lies about Moses's past. On hearing this, Moses jumps to her defence and admits that everything is true, which fills Queen Tuya, (Sigourney Weaver) with rage. Ramesses, decides to banish Moses, which doesn't please Queen Tuya, who wants him executed. Moses prepares to leave Egypt and meets his natural mother and sister Miriam, who refer to him as Moishe, his real name.His journey through the desert brings him to Midan, where he is befriended by Zipporah, (Maria Valverde) and her Father, Jethro, (Kevork Malikyan). Moses, who is now a shepherd marries Zipporah and together, have a son named Gersham, (Hal Hewetson). Nine years pass and Moses lies injured in the mud. However, he begins to discover that God has a plan for him as he is contacted by a young boy by the burning bush named Malak, (Isaak Andrews)......Gods messenger.The movie then moves through the numerous events that form the legend of Moses. Ridley Scott apparently said the original cut of Exodus: Gods and Kings, lasted for 4hrs, that being the case, 90min have been chopped before it's release to cinemas. After watching Exodus, I couldn't see where the 90min of footage would fit in to the mix. That being said, the movie does have it's good points, with some impressive special and make up effects. The sets are enormous and lavishly constructed, with some of the halls and corridors seeming endless. I thought the movie had some reasonable performances, with Christian Bale giving it a good go as Moses, Maria Valverde: Zipporah, Tara Fitzgerald: Miriam are my pick. The Exodus: Gods and Kings is a reasonable account of the story of Moses.......Is it as good as The 10 Comandments?.....I'm afraid not.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
249,scottyxl,What a PoS...,4,6 January 2015,"What bothered me the most about this movie was that it was casted very very badly. Even Christian Bale was wrong for this role. Most of the acting felt forced and unnatural to me, the relationship between the characters felt fake.On top of that the plot is rushed and just not very good story wise. I am an atheist but that does not keep me from liking movies and films about religion, this one on the other hand...Like everything else in this movie the score was not good either, it felt misplaced and IMHO sometimes at the wrong moments.There where only two positive things about this movie: - The boy who played the messenger of god (who for some reason is uncredited?) - The visuals (even though 3D added nothing of value)Maybe its just me and its just because I don't like movies that occur in the past, but I entered the theater with an open mind expecting a lot more from this cast and director.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

It's not historical, it's not Biblical, it's not anything more than a twisted director's spit on what both history and religious documents say about the people involved and the time period. The movie also has some idiotic elements: Sub Saharan blacks in Egypt ruled by Nordic Europeans, Jews building the pyramids (lol, the Great Pyramids were build at least 1000 years before Moses was even born, wtf), Jews burning (lol), Ramses (one of the best rulers of Egypt) portrayed as very dumb and as a stereotypical Nazi villain, etc.What I'd say to the director: cool story br0, at least you tricked religious people into giving you money for some bs.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Bale was good he's always good but I wasn't drawn to his character like I have been in American hustle or the fighter.I vaguely remember this story being told to me as a child in assembly in junior school and reading it in children's books. I remember the story of the river turning red,the plaque of locusts,golf ball hail stones and Moses parting the sea. In the film they seemed to come up with logical reasons why these events occurred, apart from when the Egyptian children died. For me it should of either let us believe that god did everything or come up with a logical reason why the children died, it was a bit confusing.Also the child who played god, one to watch for the future sparing with Christian Bale was impressive he held his own.All in all it is a good film, the slavery sections of the film was tough to watch because you know that actually happened and unbelievably still is.

Christian Bale was great in this movie, I think he was the perfect choice for this role.But the movie lacked a proper depth in storyline. I don't understand why the Biblical account wasn't followed.

Exodus: Gods and Kings, is based on liberation of Hebrews from Pharaoh slavery. The problem with directing epics is that story cannot be fictionalized to suit audience preferences. Taking cue from Gladiator, Kingdom of Heavens and Robin Hood, Ridley Scott creates a large scale theater with gigantic scenery and king size 3D effects which will surely make your eyes wide! The movie fares well in beginning the story where it gives a curious flavor to events, however the drama that ensues leaves us bewildered. Most of the movie-goers know the epic and did not expect a retelling. It's a good watch on a weekend because of its 3D effect especially when other options include Action Jackson/ Ungli, however Exodus can be avoided due to a lackluster drama.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

They totally changed the character of Moses, and show God as a little-spoiled kid and have silly explanations for the plagues. Is like someone tries to remake star wars and explain the force like a bunch of several coincidences and, natural cause and effect explanations or to show Obi Wan Kenobi as a hallucination of Luke, or replacing the lightsaber with a laser gun. That movie will be a disaster. Well, this is what is going one here. Changing the portrait of Moses and God. Also, Costumes looks from the middle ages rather than ancient Egypt.

256,dunfincin,Diabolical,1,7 May 2015,"I saw this movie last night and felt I had to review it today.Without doubt one of the worst films I have ever (partly) seen.Not just because,as other reviewers have said,that it is not faithful to its biblical roots or that there is little or no characterisation, it's just plain bad in almost all respects.It was like going back in time 50 or 60 years and watching some bible-based epic with Charlton Heston or Victor Mature - barely watchable now but this dross has the same effect and it hasn't even reached its first birthday.Bad casting (I think the actor who played Ramases is Russian and was a hit-man in Smoking Aces),turgid storyline,acting that would have embarrassed one of my floorboards and meaningless dialogue rather like the lyrics of a Bowie song (he used to write his stuff,cut out the lines into individual strips and mix them all up so they made no sense).I don't in any way comprehend what was going on in the Director's mind or the idiots who put up millions of dollars to fund this drivel but I am consoled by the fact that they will lose a fortune and that Mr R Scott will one day be having nightmares over it.I like big epic maybe old-fashioned films as a rule and tried to keep an open and tolerant mind having read the very mixed reviews on this site but after thirty minutes I felt that my intellect was being systematically insulted and after an hour I was hurling abuse at the TV screen and switched it off.When I think of the many hundreds of young talented people trying to make a living in the movie industry and the amount of money wasted on this one film,I just despair and I daren't go into my thoughts about the number of starving and sick African children who might have been saved by the donation of one tenth of what it cost to manufacture this gigantic, misguided, self-indulgent ego-trip.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
257,t_kam,Mixed feelings,3,10 December 2014,"The movie can be viewed in one of two ways. The first is one with a action packed spectacle laden with action scenes on the grand scale, massive vistas and a (CGI) cast of thousands but ultimately lacking in likable characters. On the other hand, if you were wanting a remake of The Ten Commandments with modern sfx then you're going to be very disappointed. From the use at the very beginning of the atheistic BCE as opposed to BC (but ironically still reliant on the birth of Christ for it's dating) you just knew the movie had as much to do with the Bible as Darren Aronofsky's Noah, i.e. not a lot with it's complete re-telling of the character of Moses to God being represented as a petulant and vindictive child. Did the screen writers even bother reading Exodus? Based on this, then the answer has to be no. Everyone has an off day and this is Ridley Scott's off day. I hope he get's back to his glory days of Alien, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down and Gladiator. I hate to think what his mini-series 'Killing Jesus' and forthcoming feature 'David' of David and Goliath is going to be like.

'Exodus' focuses on plot, intense detail, and extravagant cinematography. Like Gladiator, 'Exodus' shows not only a great film, but a great morale example, and reason. Christian Bale is finally pulling away from his trademarked Batman, and expanding his acting career. With movies like American Hustle, The Fighter, and now Exodus, he has a full foray of acting successes. Joel Edgerton, who plays Ramses, also gets his name out there after being in Warrior, and Zero Dark Thirty. VERDICT: Overall, this movie truly brought the book of Exodus to the big screen, and did a good enough job of explaining it visually. Sure the movie forgot some portions, but all in all, it was a great film. RATING: I give it a 7/10, only because, like all movies, there were some cheesy CGI parts, but thanks to the great plot, and cinematography, it pulled me in, and I couldn't stop watching. AGE: 13+.

259,rawkidd,Mediocre,4,26 December 2014,"Let me start with the actors first.Without any doubt, Christian Bale is a great actor, but in this movie he's totally misplaced. I wouldn't say his acting is bad in this one, no, but the way he portrays Moses is too much of an action or warrior figure but eventually, I think he's done what he's been told to do.Then there's a heavy weight like Ben Kingsley in the movie, but has almost no game in those few scenes. And why Sigourney Weaver? I mean, why throwing a classy actress into this pot but giving her no lines? What's the point in that?Overall the movie ain't bad, but it ain't really good either, let alone being epic. In my opinion the storytelling is too shallow at times it wastes too much time on by plays and has big gaps between important happenings. I don't know what Ridley Scott's ambition here is, but the movie lacks every ingredient to be epic or monumental. At the of the day it's a mediocre, at times CGI driven thing, with too little emotion, depth and drive (besides the war scenes)",Exodus - Gods and Kings
260,rasketeer,CGI movie with historical setting,3,25 January 2019,"The movie does not meet any criteria that comes with this heavy topic and fails everywhere.
Three stars because I like the CGI and the actors because I know they can act good, in other movies though.It is probably one of the most famous biblical stories and I would expect the movie will thematise aspects like faith and struggles in difficult situations, the fight between god's will vs individual will, morality, ...
Moses as the key figure with his change from pharao's royal family member into leader of Isrealites and prophet of the one true god.
But what is shown is a Moses who doesnt believe in his god, who does not know why he is doing what, who is unwilling to follow god's way ... and all started because Moses had an accident and was hit on this head, really?!
OK, who wouldnt doubt like Moses when god is portrait as unreasonable, angry and vengeful little kid... while writing this review I noticed that Ramses is more multifaceted portrait then Moses.At some points the movie tries change perspectives, tries to show situations from different view point, question but also fails as it doesnt go enought into depth, doesnt give the characters the opportunity to develop. Instead characters change from scene to scene with contrary behavior.Actually I cannot remember having seen a good Ridley Scott movie for quite some timeSome examples:
Struggle with faith is portrait as two people openly questioning Moses decisions and his reply is something like: follow me because I say so or die. So the Hebrews dont even accept Moses as his prophet but just follow him as he is less evil compared to Egypt slavery.Moses is secretly watched when talking to little child god, creating the perception of mentally ill person.Moses always only talks to 3 Hebrews but convinces all of the thousands others.Moses leaves his wife and kid because of his visions after head insury and because he was told he and his skills are needed for what to come. Actually Moses does not do anything except of displeasing little child god, not knowing what is happening, not knowing what to do, not agreeing with god's will, not really caring about what is happening.Moses grew up with Ramses as brothers. Ramses doesnt hesitate to cut off the arm of Moses' foster-mother just because some guy said some rumours about Moses. Then Ramses exiles Moses but gives him his sword as help for survival. Later Ramses orders Moses' death not thinking twice but always keeps a welcoming tone when they speak to each other.Ramses",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Production values through the roof as we have come to expect from Ridley with a 'Red Sea ' finale which did everything to live up to its illustrious predecessors.The way all the plagues were dealt with I found utterly plausible and the build up of angst in the Egyptian sufferers was more than believable as was their cruel stubbornness in accepting their need to give in to the not unreasonable idea that the Hebrews would like to go home after 400 years of slavery. I noted and enjoyed several tributes to the 1959 film, but others who haven't lived with it for sixty years nearly might not notice. I thought both Joel Edgerton and Christian Bale as the sibling rivals were superbly cast and gave stellar performances that even Chuck Heston and Yule Bryner would have applauded if they were around today. Well done Ridley, a man never fearful of doing what he knows is right.

They tried to explain everything with poor kindergarten stories.Another thing: having God being portrayed as a kid and the burning bush just being there as decoration... funny.Ah, and the best one: the miracle of splitting the waters... as washed down to a tide... funny.Anyway.

People who have seen 'Ten Commandments' or at least knew the story of Moses will like it (for most of the part). Others can sit through and experience the spectacular battles and plagues. Scott portrayed them as natural causes and depiction of God may not satisfy some believers. I found it better than Ten Commandments version where God is shown as an invisible person, preaching. Red sea partition is also different from the source material and the earlier film.Bale was good but not his best. The film lacks balance and editing is uneven sometimes. Scott shined at his strengths i.e visuals but we don't feel for anyone, neither the Hebrews nor the Egyptians. A story of this kind will not satisfy everyone but Scott should have done better at giving some emotional highs. He did well directing the romance angle of Moses and his wife. Of course, the best part is the plagues.CGI was fantastic. Musical score was good but lacks variety, someone like Hans Zimmer or James Horner would've elevated the film.

Address was good, Ritley Scott, no guilt, are the writers, the acting Bale was pretty good, not serious for an Oscar, but did a good job, I can salvage from the movie are the scene where they try to highlight the value of the partner or spouse is trying to sow loyalty and to imply that when we joined a woman that is where the new family is created.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This film did nothing for me and just left me numb (even though it did have some talented actors). Ridley Scott should never touch historical films. This is another Alexander ! I should always check user reviews and not the critics reviews as they are more truthful. A director should never attempt a topic like this unless they can make a better version than earlier ones.

Tony was more akin to the action thriller and may not have been overjoyed at having this dull lifeless so called epic directed his way by his brother. The characters were hollow and unlikeable and it leaps from stage to stage so quickly that it's hard to believe it was just on two and a half hours long. It does feature a pretty spectacular last twenty minutes or so but it done't make up for the first two hours. Regardless of what's been said about historical accuracy, Ridley Scott hasn't done sufficient with the story to make it interesting.

270,chloeurc,"Exodus, but not prince of Egypt",6,29 May 2020,"Like anyone who watches a movie based on a true story or even based off a book it's never 100 percent accurate, ask any movie goer. What this director and writer forgot is that it was targeting a Christian audience (for the most part) and needed to stick to the story! There are significant meaningful parts of this story that are forgotten and replaced. Moses's staff for one, not a sword. The entire relationship between God and Moses was pretty much absent. They basically filmed it as if the two never liked each other. The movie almost seems to be half on the side of the murdering villainous Ramses and half on Moses's. SEVERAL scriptures of the story weren't shown, including some of my favorite parts or they were heavily altered. I will say though there are parts in the Bible where it doesn't go into detail in which the writers had to get creative, and they did, but not in a very accurate way. I went to see this movie because I am a Christian and also a fan of Christian Bale, he is a great actor and they are moments where he and Ben Kingsley do a great job. Unfortunately because this lacked faith, heart, knowledge and respect of these biblical heroes and God for that matter, it wasn't a success.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
271,therocksbarneyreviews,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" simply doesn't earn its stars.",5,3 January 2015,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is a perfect representation of its director's/Ridley Scott's career. Hit and miss. Although Scott has done well with ""Alien"" and ""Gladiator"" in the past, films such as ""Robin Hood"" or ""The Counselor"" haven't. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" unfortunately falls into the latter category. But it's not because of whether it's poor or not, it's because it simply just doesn't earn any more of the stars than I have given it. How the film does earn the majority of its stars is in its visual effects and cinematography. Ancient Egypt looks real/seemingly historically accurate thanks to this (I can't confirm whether it is or not as I have no clue about the era) and we can also praise those in charge of costume, makeup, set in regards to this. All of this made me want to go and read up on everything Ancient Egypt. And it's not just the landscape that looks great either, the film's visual effects and cinematography really shine when we see the 10 plagues, or rather the highlight of ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"". First comes the river running red with blood, then the frogs, the lice, the flies, the dead livestock, the boils, the hailstorms, the locusts, the darkness and then the death of Egypt's first born. These each looked incredible and I really do mean that. The films visual effects and cinematography are on par with those in ""Interstellar"" and therefore the best I've seen and experienced since I started reviewing. I really felt like God was having his way. But this is where things turn sour. The use of that one word. God. Obviously he's going to make an appearance in the film. And he is portrayed as a kid, played by the British 11 year old Isaac Andrews. Now, I had no idea how they were going to portray God in this film. And I was surprised when this kid ominously appears to Moses (Christian Bale), speaking fluently and suggesting he go free ""his people""/the Hebrews. This works initially. But what begins to develop is this really annoying character. And halfway through the film, it seemed even Moses was annoyed at him. But it is when Aaron Paul (playing Joshua) (yes you read that correctly, and yes he's terrible, stick to the meth Jesse) when watching Moses talking to God sees him talking to nothing, even though it's clear that God is there because of the massive hailstorm in the background, that I realised that Scott is perhaps trying to say something here in regards to God. This is a difficult point to explain. Let me start by explaining how Moses never seems like he really is a Hebrew and I don't recall Moses calling himself a Hebrew at any point in the film. There is no flashbacks to say that Moses is a Hebrew neither. We can only trust what people are saying. Now, for me, this raised a question of doubt in regards to whether God was meant to be seen as real in the film, or as just one of Moses illusions? Let me point out that there is no question as to whether God is real or not in this film. He is meant to be real. Hence the plagues and the sea parting. But to a modern viewer, such as myself, I found myself asking the question as to whether God was real. As to whether in our society we should be praising this petulant kid who wants his way or Moses. I mean, what kind of God would realise 10 plagues like that on anyone? The film poses that question well. So it can be commended for that too. Now, that's all that's good in the film, unfortunately. The rest is poor. Neither Joel Edgerton (playing Rameses) nor Christian Bale save the day. The script is terrible, again not quite living up to its source material. Yet that is, to be fair, all that ""Exodus Gods: and Kings"" does poorly. The rest is simply below average. It is not a good film. Films have to earn their stars and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" simply only earns 5. OUT OF 10. Jeez.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Seriously this most wonderful of actresses appears fleetingly in a couple of scenes near the beginning with NO DIALOG, then in two more very inconsequential scenes later where she actually gets to say something that pretty much any character in the film could have fulfilled. Obviously Ms. Weaver and Mr. Scott have a past working together and is why she appears here but you would think Mr. Scott would have more respect for his friend and colleague to at least give her something significant to do. I hope Ms. Weaver laughed all the way to the bank because it must have been the easiest pay check she ever earned. While there is much to be disappointed about in this Exodus, I am most disappointed by the extreme under used of one of the industry's most talented and respected actors.

I got to FINALLY see Exodus tonight & I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. Exodus is an EPIC MOVIE (I'd give it an 8 out of 10)! I'd highly suggest it to anyone who wants to see a really cool interpretation of Scripture. (don't see it if you're a Biblical puristyou will be disappointed) Biblical accuracy? Ehnot TOO bad by Hollywood standards (hence why I gave it an 8). Attractive actors playing key roles? CHECK! Moses portrayed as a BA prophet of Israel? CHECK!

Needless to say, this movie was, in my opinion, a horrible misrepresentation of the Bible story and the people producing it should stand in shame before God for releasing it! Here is a good example of what I am talking about: Parting of the Ocean Scene There was no real parting of the ocean scene. The tides just receded and the Israelites sort of waded to the other side as Moses led them with his Egyptian sword in hand (didn't see a staff?) and he kept waving that gold sword around like it was His holy scepter. Then he goes out to try to save the Egyptian king from drowning and they both got bombarded by the ocean rolling back in like a Tsunami, but somehow, they both survived a hundred foot wave crashing on them and both swam ashore to opposite sides.My Conclusion: 3D effects really sucked and the movie was not worth the $16 matinée price I paid. There were only two other people in the theater and they rushed out before the colossal mess was finished.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Ridley Scott fails to show spiritual aspect of the story completely .You never really see the feelings between 2 brothers . Aaron Paul , Ben Kingsley , Sigourney Weaver they hardly do anything on the film .And though Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors and he do decent job in this movie i think Jim Caviezel would fit much better for the role of moses ( more spiritual and less fighting moses though ). a lot of scenes felt rushed even thought he movie wasn't short . 7 sins looked fantastic but lacked the emotional power you see in ""prince of Egypt"" and the last sea scene didn't actually looked that cool , which should have been best scene of the movie :) overall it's a good blockbuster movie and you will have fun watching it on a big screen but don't expect much or you will be disappointed . 6.5/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings

A lot of story telling ad-libbing going on with really terrible outcomes. I want to give this movie some credit for the effort the actors put in, along with the everyone else involved. And for them I do appreciate the effort...butThe story is about the relationship between God and his chosen people. That's the story! When God speaks to Moses, Moses falls flat on his face. When Moses asks God who He is, God replies authoritatively, ""I am"", you can say to them that ""I am"" sent you. The ""I am"" is one of the most powerful sayings in the entire bible.

283,erhen-o,"Moses, the prophet warrior",4,4 January 2015,"Another warrior movieOh no. Just another warrior movie. I spotted it from miles away with the movie posters of course, but I went to see the movie anyway because it was made by Ridley Scott, the same who made the ingenious Prometheus (it was really the only reason to see it). I avoid warrior movies like the recent Noah where the Gladiator actor was starring, because it is just pathetic. It is a failing pathetic and reducing view of what manhood is and should be. Why do they always have to be brainless warriors??! Moses is supposed to be a prophet, a leader, a wise person, all the contrary of a warrior.Unmotivated MosesMoses doesn't seem to like his people, he's just guided by a creepy kid in his head, and even weirder he has sarcastic comments about religion itself like he doesn't believe in it at all. I mean it is the story of Moses, the Bible prophet you are making a movie about! You get the feeling that the modern philosophy was projected on the story, it produced a distorted and phony movie.Weak storyI didn't dislike that every single ""miracle"" was rationalized and not made in a spectacular, fireworks and over the moon way, but I regret that all the plagues were just succeeding each other in sequence like programmed from God's supercomputer. Ramses was just a victim, the movie never showed how strongly he refused to free the slaves even when warned about the God's punishment. He seemed really powerless. Also, the burning bush was totally pointless. If you didn't know the original story, you would think what is that? Why is there a burning bush behind the creepy kid? It feels they just copy pasted it from our imagination to the screen, it served no purpose at all.Typical Hollywood fairy taleI also went for the visual effects. It was described by the marketing as spectacular, but I didn't see where the show was. It's no more than any other Hollywood blockbuster, it was OK. But you get all the Hollywood typical fairy tale narrative. For example, Moses gets back to his wife who has been nicely waiting for him all this years but hasn't gotten any older at all, of course.What's with Sigourney Weaver?So why didn't she get more than a 3 words line? It was really disappointing that Sigourney played such a small and invisible part in the movie, I mean why did she accept it? She's great she should be accepting greater roles.How to improveThe movie could have been so much better if it insisted on relationships. They should have developed the relationships between Moses and Ramses, Moses and his people, Moses and God. Put more rivalry perhaps between the brothers, develop Ramses character, show how torn Moses was to chose his people and how his relationship to God was (beyond the creepy kid metaphor). Moses story is really incredible and beautiful, yet the story of him being left in the river was told to him just like that in the movie, no emotion, no flashbacks, like it's not exceptional. Anyway it's too late now for feedback I think, it's not like they're gonna make ""Moses II, he returns"", please don't do that.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
284,SIshh,The book is much better,1,5 December 2014,"Some ***SPOILERS***Amazing visuals aside this was a poor movie. When will filmmakers realise the MAIN reason the majority of people watch films is for a story to be told and to relate to the characters involved - NOT to see amazing visuals, as entertaining as they are! The story of Moses in the Bible is rich, amazing and epic. Unfortunately the story in this film is slow, lacks heart, but more importantly, completely betrays the original ""true"" story. The scene where Moses kills an Egyptian was flat, empty and over before you could blink. What should have been one of the biggest moments in the movie to help understand Moses passion for his people, character, disdain for Egypt (according to the movie he LOVED Egypt) and origins ended in a flash. Moses showed zero remorse in what was more an act of self defense over empathy. When you don't tell the whole truthful story the characters involved are ultimately betrayed. The movie suffers from this particularly in God's character. Ridley Scott seems determined to focus on the supposed relationship between Moses and his supposed brother. But we never really care about either of them or their relationship. Not to mention the Bible never mentions this, in fact it implies that the Pharaoh at the time of Moses return didn't even care about him or perhaps even know him?Ridley Scott would have done well to concentrate on staying true to the story and establishing a connection between the audience and the two central characters: God and Moses.

It's good for 10-12 years old who doesn't even know what ""taste"" means and how much the song is actually wrong about the reality it's describing. Acting is the weakest of this movie elements. It probably started with very poor cast: John Turturro (great actor but very unfitting here), Aaron Paul (since when he can play?), Sigourney Weaver (maybe it was the fault of characterization...). Even Christian Bale was paid to just show up and that's exactly what he did. Actor known very well of his ability to become the character he is playing, here he simply reads the lines like the rest of the actors. I was surprised by Joel Edgerton performance. He actually was pretty good. Screenplay... Well I do not understand why Hollywood directors are so persistent in making already good story ""better"". Braking the logic behind the motivations of main characters is unbearable. You simply cannot watch this move and not ask yourself ""what the hell?!"". Theological incorrectness is not what I'm aiming for here. I'm talking about simple logic, consistency. Main character (Moses) is very vague and dull. I just wanted for him to stop whining. It was so frustrating watching him progress through the story. Terrible. I read this story once now and then I pretty much liked him. But Ridley made him totally unlikable. Scott did not explored any of intriguing elements of Moses motivations, problems, dilemmas. Overall this movie is bad. Very poor performance of most actors created very artificial world.

The 2 stars are purely for the VFX since it is fairly good... the rest is a lot of western humanistic rubbish! I accept the Hebrew Scriptures but not Christian Scriptures but would feel as appalled if I watch a story (i.e. Crucifixion) and it was not true to the story. Now here we have an amazing story (whether some believe it or not), but changing it from what we know in the Hebrew Scripture, even one minor point, makes it idiotic and not fit for consumption by anyone.It starts already early in the story. Moses (Mosheh - at least they got that right once or twice) kills a guard?!? It should have been an Egyptian fighting with a Hebrew. The errors are too numerous to mention all.Moses is 40 when he flees and 80 when he returns. He looks close to 40 when he is exiled (imagine -he does not flee!) and wanders in the desert and then meets Sephora (daughter of Reuel/Jethro - priest of Midian). He married Sephora and stayed until he was 80! He took, his wife, and sons and they did not stay behind. He spoke to Pharaoh before every plague.It is quite obvious this movie was made and written by people who have no respect for the truth or how a story was originally written and believe that they can make change as and how they please.It is time that a story should be told correctly.The additions such as a Jewish Chuppa and typical Jewish marriage ceremony combined with typical western humanism were rather atrocious.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

For example:***minor spoiler...I guess***The 1st plague, turning red of the Nile River, was not done with a staff in the water. Giant crocodiles came up and...well...acted like the shark in Jaws. Along with the death of all the fish, the water turned red with blood.I am alright with this. It stayed rather close to the 1st plague, and kept the same mood. The beginning of the end for Egypt, signified with blood. The upcoming doom that they would bring upon themselves. ***end of spoiler***I am a Christian, and I hated Noah. It was disrespectful in every sense. Exodus: Gods and Kings was not this way. It was unique, and it was good.

But this retelling, in Exodus: Gods and Kings, is as classic and beautifully directed and told, having captured the same noble, epic history, values and morals as the original. It is as grand-standing as the original, yet modern technology and Hollywood's penchant for sensationalism did not corrupt the basic tenet of the awe-inspiring greatness of the most world-renown men in ancient Christian history.I used to love Christian Bale, but lost all favor when I watched his real-life epic, vitriolic melt-down, caught-on-camera, on the set during the filming on one of his movies. His dynamic performance in this movie and portrayal of Moses is nothing less than awe-inspiring and demanding of respect. Regardless of what Bale's real-life nature is, one cannot help but find him worthy as a divinely-gifted actor. His role as Moses has made me forgive and let go of that horrible violent tantrum, and what better way to have done so than to remind us all, by playing one of the Bible's greatest men in Christian history, that we are all prone to sin, yet we are also all divine and working our way back to God.THIS is how much watching this movie affected me. And I'm committed to re-reading the Old Testament, so much moved by this incredible movie and performance.The ratings may not reflect my awed opinion, but as we must always strive to remember, let YOU be your own judge, and not influenced by either the approval or disapproval of other viewer's opinions.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

291,christineyoon,Excellent,7,12 August 2016,"Tons of thrilling battle scenes, unexpected twists on the story, and eye-opening effects complete the Biblically-inspired film, Exodus: Gods and Kings. In the Old Testament, Moses and Ramses were princes of Egypt. However, Moses discovered that he was born a Hebrew and was floated across the Nile River and was adopted by Queen Bithia into the Egyptian royal family. Moses' impact was that he led the Hebrews out of Egypt, where they were under bondage.The opening scene captures the bravery and strength that Moses, the general of the Egyptian royal army, already has, as the army battles against a foreign tribe. We come to see that Moses and Ramses are brothers, living lives in privilege and luxury as the Egyptian royal family in the city, Memphis. Moses soon learns that he is not the person that he grew up his entire life. When Ramses heard word of Moses' true identity, he exiled Moses. Years later, Moses received prophecies from God, which told him to lead the Hebrews out of bondage. Moses left his home and family to return to Memphis and lead the Hebrews. Moses led the exodus out of Egypt on his original path, iconically parting the Red Sea for the Hebrews to pass safely.Ridley Scott, director of such award-winning, successful films as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Prometheus, and The Counselor, creates a twist on the story of the exodus led by Moses. Christian Bale (Batman) stars as Moses, alongside Joel Edgerton (The Great Gatsby) as King Ramses, Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) as Joshua, Sigourney Weaver (Aliens) as Queen Tuya, and Ben Kingsley (Ghandi) as Nun. Released on December 12, 2014, Exodus earned $24.5 million on its opening weekend, beating out Mockingjay for the top box-office spot.Scott's depiction of God is distinct and unprecedented, and the special effects are stunning. Whether you know the story of exodus through and through, or are familiar with it, or don't know it at all, you should try the film because it will be very different than what you would expect; it takes a turn from the Biblical story.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
292,Franco_Strydom,"It's epic and long, but that's it.",6,5 January 2015,"Exodus is an impeccably crafted film. Everything is big and beautiful (or equally ugly where appropriate). I quite enjoyed the casting and the acting was engaging but for one or two moments. It achieves the grandeur required with excellence and is also most definitely a Ridley Scott film. Turning religious stories into films are dangerous as it can very easily draw ridicule. At the same time, removing yourself from the spiritual aspect of a story (as the story teller) is necessary if your aim is for the film to be accessible to a wider audience; for whatever reason. This narrative stays true to the greater biblical tale of Moses, the ten plagues and the Hebrew exodus from Egypt. The ten plagues are presented in a very non supernatural way, allowing the godly influence to be called into question. That is until the tenth plague strikes, which is ominous, unexplained and beautifully captured in the visual expression. The pace and tension between the characters and in the narrative is so tangible that there is no need for an explanation, it happens and resolves a greater story which drives the film forward. This was impressively done even if the first nine plagues became a little dull, going from one to the other for no other reason than, it needs to. My biggest grip with the film, beyond the tragic cinematic resolution of the Red Sea, is the character development of Moses, or lack thereof. Considering the life experiences Moses had to endure and with the great changes in scenery, there could have been a greater development in the man. The film stretches over multiple decades, which it goes quite well, but it doesn't come across in the character of Moses. From being an upper class citizen in Egypt to a shepherd in rural community, surely a person's character, or at least his demeanor, would change. I enjoyed the fact that the audience is warmed up to some of the Egyptian characters, it makes for perspective. The portrayal of the Hebrew God was strange. You can't really tell the story of Moses without involving 'God' and 'God' is a difficult character to work with. 'God' is all knowing and all powerful and we as human beings can't comprehend that, so having that in a film becomes problematic as it's not filmic. Scott did a good job at it though and the only thing that could have made it better was greater and more meaningful interactions between Moses and 'God'. The amount of interaction was fine - that played well to the concept of faith - but in the interactions I wanted more. Here is a mortal man, with his opinions on life and the world faced with the all-knowing all powerful but merciful and loving 'God'; now that has the potential for some incredible film and some incredible acting opportunity for Christian Bale who could handle it. The physical portrayal of God is effective; it works well with other Christian elements while also being a little strange. Technically Exodus is what you expect it to be, solid, beautiful and clean. The characters are mostly what and who you expect them to be and they act the way you expect them to act - especially if you've heard the story before – but that's it. There's nothing 'new'. There's no insight, no angle on the story to get you thinking on something other than the obvious hitting points of the greater story. I enjoyed it, but I wanted more from the film than just a visual telling of a story I'd heard before.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
293,Lesego-Madisa,A very warming and artistic film about an ancient era.,8,15 January 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings (director Ridley Scott) has been a brilliant and exciting experience. The journey that was filled with sweeping shots and CGI ancient village slums was a wonder to see on the big screen.Though filled with historical inaccuracies like Noah. The movie is played by former Batman star, Christian Bale (Plus his real name suited him for this movie) using a sword to part the Red sea instead of a staff. He wasn't even trying to part the seas but only just throwing his weapon because he was angry that him and his slaves were trapped.Moses' vision of God was done poorly and was completely odd. God is played by a grumpy young British kid who has heavy mood swings. No one except Moses can either see him or make direct contact with him.The kid never answers Moses' burning issues but talks at him. This would make sense because even the original God does not have any more Q's and A's with modern people. He works in mysterious ways.The 10 plagues were unforgettable and beautiful to see. That was what the whole movie was about. Seeing modern day technology recreating the biblical plaques.Like the Red Sea turning into blood. Ridley's justification was that crocodiles eat each other up. Even God must have been impressed.Ramses did an amazing job when he wept for his first born child as part of the plaques. I've noticed that men better express themselves when saddened by a passing of a child. Parallel with Shutter Island when DiCaprio wails for his three children which were drown by his crazy wife.The combat in the beginning was awesome and had quick reflexes way better than Troy (2004) when Moses saves Ramses from a chariot that was about to ram him. The romance between Moses and his wife was cute, unique and original. They had their own unique way of relating to each other. Truth be told, the absence of a heavenly body bothered a lot of people because we never get a sense of the almighty structure that is above Egypt.Another thing is it wouldn't have made any sense for Moses to carry a dumb staff and path the seas with it. The movie was just trying to justify events we'd conclude as miracles.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
294,warriorspirit,Unsympathetic and unrealistic portrayal,4,23 January 2016,"First and foremost, if you are going to make a biblical or religious epic, then you should be faithful and sympathetic to the scripture and not try to retrospectively rationalize it. In the biblical worlds miracles, God speaking to man, sorcery, magic are integral parts and to remove them for a more secular interpretation is to do violence to the text. It is somebody making LOTR without wizards and elves. This is the biggest ""sin"" Ridley Scott commits he tries to present the mythological drama like a real life historical drama and the supernatural elements are reinterpreted; God spake to moses becomes a hallucinatory vision of a scary young boy; Moses's plagues become a series of chance incidents and Moses parting the red sea becomes a freak meteorite strike, leaving it open for secular interpretation And there is no Moses turning staff into a snake(how would you interpret that secularly?) Mr Scott should have first decided whether wants to make a mythological epic or a historical epic. The latter is already a fail with the historical community as there is scarce if any historical evidence for Moses. So Mr Scott should have made a mythological epic and pulled all stops.The other problem I had with this film was the casting and the language which I felt were anachronistic .You can tell this is a modern re-telling of the story, it almost like Alexander set in biblical times. Moses is portrayed more like a war commander than a prophet and his supporters are portrayed as rebels rather than people with love for the Messiah. I also don't understand this bizarre convention in Hollywood that to make a character evil, make it speak Queens English. The evil characters in this movie speak English. I understand that the movie should be presented in English to get a wider audience, but at least try to adding some ancient historical character to the speech, rather than making them sound like James Bond.Technically, I felt the movie used a lot of dark depressing tones and looked barren and dull. Some the VFX work was blurry.Overall: forgettable",Exodus - Gods and Kings
295,redwingsm,Exodus shines in its magnificence. Sour reviews unfounded.,8,7 March 2015,"First, I would like to address the naysayers and 'hate' reviews I've seen for this movie for being historically inaccurate. I find this reason for a poor review to be, unfortunately, historically accurate. As nobody has firsthand experience from a story told over 4000+ years ago there is no possible way to actually make a movie based on the life of Moses and those around him, historically accurate. It is all based on a translation of documents (books) passed down through generations of re-writes and embellished stories written in a time where true knowledge was scarce and the lack of a print press meant everything was written by hand by man. The bible goads over the imperfections of man yet relies on man's interpretation (vis-à-vis; The Bible) to be factually accurate. The hypocrisy is self evident to anyone being truthful to themselves and others. This is why so many poor reviews have made it to the light of day because so many people out there take the story of Moses (from The Bible) to be a factually accurate account of his time on Earth.Anyway, I digress. Exodus: Gods and Kings has wonderful acting and direction and should be lauded for such. Any reviews lower than 5 stars are simply false and should be ignored due to this. That being said, I found this movie to be superb in many ways that off-put many Christian moviegoers. They took an old story and made it fresh and believe it or not, somewhat believable and much easier on the stomach than its original material. Without going into detail they have taken the story of Moses and made many changes that could rightfully explain some of the more outrageous claims made by The Bible. While this made many hard nose bible thumping Christians raise their arms in disgust, this Christian applauds the effort and yearns for more.Christian Bale does a fine job as Moses and really shows he still has it and will likely end up with the greats such as Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood and Robert De Niro who have stood the test of time and, in many instances, gotten better with age. While I'm not a fan of Christian Bale as a person, I am truly awed at his acting ability. Joel Edgerton as the antagonist also does a fine job of showing the conflict within himself of having to deal with his ""brother's"" new- found God and people. I loved him in Warrior and he does a great job here, as well.Unlikely TV personality turned silver screener Aaron Paul shows that he can actually do something outside of Jessie from Breaking Bad and was much better than I expected, albeit not perfect.John Turturro, Ben Kingsley & Siqourney Weaver also have roles and each do a fantastic job with the material they were given. Sadly Ms. Weaver did not get near enough screen time and I sincerely hope there are many deleted scenes on the DVD/Blu-Ray that involve her.In conclusion, Exodus: Gods and Kings is a great movie with a good story, great actors and superb direction. The CG is top rate with some real breathtaking scenes showing what civilization may have looked like 4000+ years ago. Just be warned, the story has been changed to reflect miracles in a different, more palatable light. Go in with an open mind and not an open Bible and you will enjoy yourself immensely.*This review is of the NON-3D version of the film. I felt adding 3D to an historic account may have taken me out of the movie so I chose to see it in normal format. However, from what I'm hearing from others, I may have made the wrong choice. Either way, I am very pleased with my experience and would gladly recommend Exodus to others.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
296,ajsf_2,Meh,5,10 March 2015,"Where to start? I was actually enjoying the movie, until the last 30 minutes. For the reviews I saw, I was not expecting a very good movie, and in the last minutes I realize why the movie had so bad rating. I actually think it has more than it deserves, that's why I'm giving it 5 out of 10 stars. First of all, the movie was being good. Even though the dialogs were very poor, specially in such a good actor like Aaron Paul. He barely had the chance to show his talent in this movie. Even for Christian Bale, there was not very emotion in his role as Moses. I was expecting bad CGI, but during the movie I enjoyed it, except in the last scene, in the Red Sea. That one was terrible. Also, the movie sins for not telling the storie exactly as described in the bible. A lot of stuff is different from what people learn as Christians. I was going to give this movie a 6, but the last minutes, like I said before, really ruined the movie. Don't recommend it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
297,ajknexlang,Watch the original,4,28 March 2015,"As far as movies go, meh. I have no idea what the purpose of this film was supposed to be other than just another Hollywood flick. I found the plot rather flimsy and whimsical and while I can understand ""a different point of view"", this wasn't one. The story was rewritten to focus on humanity and it's failures and recast God as a vengeful bitter child, completely forgetting the reason why there was a story in the first place. Instead of a story about the Israelites rediscovering their faith and putting their trust back in their creator, you get a confused exiled man being encouraged by a vengeful entity to go on a personal vendetta for something he knows nothing about. Oh wait, we don't want to offend any religious folk, so lets throw in just enough religion to make it confusing and misleading.You're far better off watching the original ""The Ten Commandments"" from 1956. Very long movie but it doesn't leave you scratching your head at the end.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
298,lemuel1985,"Decent movie, nothing special but not bad at all",7,17 December 2014,"I have to start by saying I am a huge fan of Bale but this was not his best movie. As always he gave a strong performance but the movie was nothing spectacular. I went into this movie with low expectations based on previous reviews but I have to say that it was a decent movie. By saying it was a decent movie I think it can explain a lot about this movie. Everything about this movie was average except the visuals, the visuals where really good. It had a decent storyline, they didn't take to many risks or stayed totally true to the story, the acting apart from Bale was average, the action sequences where average and everything else was average, I think I made my point. I really liked the way they portrayed Moses, and the way they portrayed his struggles between helping his people and the feelings he had for the people who raised him. On the other hand I think that the use of the boy to portray god was an interesting twist but it was kind of silly.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
299,rwatt92,"It Looks Epic, Just Doesn't Feel Epic",4,13 December 2014,"The most has it's problems but ambition is certainly not one of them. Acclaimed director Ridley Scott has had his share of flops but even those films are always great to look at and ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is know exception. The overhead shots in this movie are breathtaking and as much as CGI was used in the film, he is done competently and wisely. Visuals like the a massive quarry where the slaves are working and the massive city of Memphis with it's monuments are something that needs to be scene in theaters. Though it certainly has the ingredients of a great epic reminiscent of Cecil B. DeMille, it definitely doesn't live up to it, due to reasons I will explain.In telling the classic story of Exodus, the movie makes the interesting decision of starting with Moses as and adult and skipping him as an infant being dropped at the Pharaoh's palace. Instead we soon see an epic battle between the Egyptians and the Hittites not dissimilar to the way Scott's ""Gladiator"" began. Although the battle looks epic, it is edited in a way that I couldn't tell what happened until it was explained afterward. Including battle scenes is an interesting idea to put in an Exodus epic but by skipping Moses's childhood I feel like a missed much of he and Ramses's history and chemistry. They were brothers after all. By explaining other events from the movie I don't feel I'm spoiling anything, since they're so common knowledge. The ten plagues are each filmed brilliantly but they are presented in a way that's just one after the other. I was reminded of the underrated 1998 animated film ""The Prince of Egypt"" which presented them in an epic musical montage. And also the parting of the Red Sea which should have been the film's money shot. Granted it is epic in scope, but it's edited in a way that you can't really tell what's happening. I don't even remember Moses actually parting it. Instead, we just see the Hebrews walk across only to have enormous waves crashing on the Egyptians.As Moses, I feel that Christian Bale is a mixed bag as him. In earlier scenes it doesn't seem like he was giving much to role. However later in the movie when he's has much longer beard after discovering his true identity, he does bring some psychological complexity to his character as he faces the moral dilemma of having the people he grew up with suffer until his people are released. Joel Edgerton I felt could have had more fun as Ramses. The other great actors in the film Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver, and Aaron Paul (as Joshua) get so little screen time I feel their presence was wasted. There were some other questionable decisions made like the way God was presented. I won't spoil that but I'm just not sure how I feel about it. However another key problem with the movie was the pacing. There is a sequence where Moses starts a family that gets dragged on. Much of the time watching the film I was bored but said to myself ""At least the movie looks great."" The trailer for this movie looked amazing and considering the potential it should have been so much better. Christian Bale needed to flat out say ""Let my people go!"" in the guise of the late Charlton Heston. Usually with this kind of rating I would suggest people to see it for free on demand if they feel like it. However, while it isn't the great epic it should be, I will say that if you decided to see it- It should be on the big screen.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
300,cerca-sonia,What happened to Scott?,5,11 February 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is a huge disappointment. This story, which has been told and retold for thousands of years, deserved something better than this. And it really means a lot coming from an atheist. Ridley Scott brought to the screen his own interpretation of the Bible, and is it good? No, it isn't. $140 Million probably spent for special effects, costumes and a cast full of stars, but surely not on the script. I was expecting a spectacular Red Sea parting, but there is no trace of it. It is a mystery how Scott did such a poor movie.Christian Bale is mediocre, delivering an emotionless performance - I wasn't expecting this from him at all. Joel Edgerton is surprisingly good.More at: afilmadaybysonia.blogspot.com",Exodus - Gods and Kings
301,ggallegosgroupuk,Darling! Moses is on the phone....,2,21 April 2017,"What, in God's name, was this? Everything reeks of commercial operation without any real thought behind it. Of all the puzzling elements in this bizarre epic, the most inexplicable is Christian Bale as Moses. Not the choice of Christian Bale - commercial operation, remember - no, that I understand, what's inexplicable is his performance. We know now Christian Bale is a great actor. Great. The Fighter alone puts him right up there with some of the best of his generation so why then he's so bad, but so bad here. His Moses is absent. Not a moment of truth, not a moment of real connection. Was he a hostage, performing against his will? That's what I felt, that he didn't want to be there and that alone made me watch the whole film with disdain. What a disheartening experience. I give it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for the crew, because their work is real and present on the screen.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

It definitely wasn't because of some religios motivation because it exceeds at missing the point. So in the end all we have is a cliche action movie based on the bible made for no one.

303,Drogan-Hex,Emotionless,5,8 April 2021,"The defiant leader Moses rises up against Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II, setting six hundred thousand slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues.Before I get into this review, I want to stress on a subject first. The storyline of this movie is based on the biblical story of Moses, but it is not his story and does not reflect the story as it is in the bible. I have seen a lot of wrongly based reviews and incredibly low ratings because of this.Directing: Ridley Scott needs no introduction, but I must say that he took a noticeably big leap with this movie. I am not disappointed with his vision and the crucial changes he made to the original story because that his own vision and he has the right to do whatever he wants with it. When it comes to stories that have a deep historical and religious following one must be careful when relaying that story especially in a high budget international movie which is something Ridley did not take into consideration.Production: One thing that jumped out to me was the numerous Egyptian producers and executive producers that worked in the team to make this movie as historically realistic as possible with extensive attention to detail. With Ridley on set, I would expect nothing less than perfection. The Hiring thought was not accurate to say the least and this showed drastically throughout the movie.Script: The script plays the most important part in movies such as this one, especially when it is based on a true story and more importantly when it is referenced biblically. Extreme caution needs to be taken when writing such a script. I can't say the writers did a bad job, but what I can say is that they approached this movie as they would any other, and I suspect this was the intention of Ridely.Acting: I am not sure what happened here, Bale is a phenomenal actor, so is Sigourney and Kingsley. I must say that the acting overall was bland. Throughout the movie I felt there is something missing, I can't wrap my head around what it is exactly, but I had this constant feeling that there is something missing in their performance. I am also not fully convinced that Turturo was the best decision here to take on the role of Seti. To be honest, I didn't feel any of the main actors fit their roles except Edgerton whom I think did an amazing job as Ramses.Cinema and sound: The numerous nominations, the 140 million plus thrown at this movie should be the ""enough said"". Visually stunning, amazing sets, extreme attention to detail in everything and some of the best camera work I've seen. I would expect nothing less with Ridley on set and they deserve the praise. I especially like the score by Alberto Iglesias and felt it fit this movie very well.Conclusion: I was excited to watch this movie, but I am saddened to say that I ended up leaving disappointed. Movies such as this need to have a deep emotional connection with the viewer, and the lack of it makes it bland and only watchable for the stunning cinematography.I give Exodus: Gods and Kings a rating of 5/10.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
304,ideorium,see it if you wanna see how far a film can be disappointing,1,20 December 2014,"It was as disappointing as how far a film can be... Seems like there's a tendency in Hollywood that Prophet films need to be tied up natural causes, a little bit self-interpretations of main character's imagination which can be mistaken by the Creator's will etc, All these turns out to be a very boring prophet film when you claim it as a prophet film. So Rather see this film as another version of historical boring fiction... Moses has a very rich story in all Abrahim religions and finally in Quran, having not seen those points presented and carried properly, makes the film a bit shallow...

It was so long ago that no person can be sure what exactly happened. Furthermore, it doesn't blindly glorify god, like the bible, is not the full truth anyway, tells a more realistic tale, of how one man goes from Egyptian royalty and brothers in arms to Jesus Christ a leader of the Jews.

Had the visuals not been so eye-catching, this movie would've been a 3-rating for me. I know the Moses story well, and while I am OK with some adaptation and interpretation for dramatic effect - this film is a poor shadow of the story in Exodus.

307,kari-lh,History put into a flashing costume,8,8 December 2014,"It's the late bronze age, the Egyptian empire continues to flourish under the rule of the godlike pharaohs. Ramses the crown prince and Moses grow up as brothers. With a swift turn of events they are turned against each other in a war that would affect everyone in the kingdom.This film delivers a clear insight of the ancient Egyptian kingdom. The sets are truly amazing. The city itself is highly detailed where every aspect of it seems to be carefully thought of. The costumes are also amazing. In order to create a city of this scale, a lot of it is CGI animated. I think it is well done and it doesn't look unreal. Although CGI are used a lot in this film and perhaps it might have been less, but it is definitely not a flaw.The story in this film is not an exact copy of history. However it gets all the facts right and it follows history quite accurately in terms of major actions. The rest is not described exactly as it is supposed to have happened but from a new view. Moses is a very interesting character and a bit controversial. He doesn't believe in omens and other types of superstition. All in all Moses is a very intelligent man, a great general and is overall good at managing things. Those are all qualities fit for a great leader. What I like most about Moses' character is that he is just a regular man with great ambition.There is one theme in this movie which is very unique and unusual. I don't think it has been done in a religious film like this one. That is that God is portrait as a sinister being. He only cares about ""his people"" and is ready to kill as many Egyptians as he likes to ensure the welfare of his people. Not to mention the vast numbers of Hebrews he also kills with his plagues. This attitude is difficult for Moses as he doesn't approve of many things his god does. I think that is an interesting view on these biblical stories. God in this film is not the same god as appears in the bible but the one that exists in a lot of peoples minds. Although I believe in God myself, I think this is a good portrait of God as religion is the source of most wars and evil in our world.There is one flaw in this film. Although it is over 2 hours long, some scenes are cut too fast. At one point you think Moses is leaving and then suddenly a few months have passed and when you are still trying to figure things out another few months pass with a single cut. Then after a while a message comes to the screen telling you 9 years have passed. It was a bit confusing and in a film like this you often need time to relax when there are scenes with less action. Another thing is that the ending is rather dull. I'm not going to go in detail why the ending isn't great because otherwise I would be spoiling it for you.Overall it's a very good film. It delivers what you expect, fantastic sets, good storyline, great acting and action. But it also leaves a lot behind for those who know about the origins of religion. For an epic film like this you need a strong ending. Sadly that is not a case in this one. A powerful ending similar to Scott's Gladiator would have made it even better.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
308,artyyeo,Fair,6,22 December 2014,"If I consider it just purely as a movie, it's above average but not the best from Ridley Scott. The dialogs were nothing to boast about compared to Gladiator. Cinematography and special effects are well above average. The story line is not inspiring; mainly, it is too human- centric.With the couple of big stars (Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver), I felt quite bad for them actually, Their roles were minuscule and did not reflect the full potential of what they can say and do. They seem to be playing the role of light garnishing.Here is the bulk of the review. Since this movie is derived from the Old Testament (OT) of the Bible and the Jewish Torah, the crux of the story is deeply religious and must be judged using the Scriptures as a reference.As a believer, this movie depicted a zero (on a scale of 0 -10) for the fear of the LORD coming from a human. In this area, it was exceptionally disappointing to see how little Moses fear God as a major prophet in the OT. I do not know of any prophet in the Scriptures who did not fear the Living God. Moses' conversation with God (represented by a mean-spirited boy) was beyond redemption. I simply cannot picture a prophet yelling at his God; perhaps, this only happens in the 21st Century.The depiction of God using a boy to represent Him is off-base. Yes, I understand that Ridley said he wanted the innocence of the boy to represent God's purity. But, the unfathomable Creator, the supremacy of the Almighty, was shrunk down to a little boy. In the conversations between Moses and God, the boy displayed an attitude that commanded no respect from a mortal. There was not a sense of pure holy judgment but more of a spoiled brat talking. This is approaching sacrilegious in dimensions. No where in the Scriptures was God ever depicted that way in those passages relating the story of Moses. I believe the Ten Commandment movie had a far more accurate depiction.Not a single Scriptural quotation was uttered in this 2.5 hour long movie. If Ridley really wanted to make this movie to have more punch, some fair amount of authenticity must be adhered to. For example, the conversations just simply did not display majesty in all of the conversations between Moses and God; unfortunately, even when the Pharaoh was talking. There is a large element of authenticity missing.The conversation between Moses' newly wedded wife and him on their first night together is human-centric again. In fact, what she asked of him were heresies even for her Bedouin tribes who were believers of the same Abrahamic God.The accuracy of the story was far and wide inaccurate. In particular, the identity of Moses as a Hebrew was muddled beyond belief. Also, Moses being washed away by the collapsing waves was again unscriptural. Same with Pharaoh. The reasoning behind the 10 plagues were straight out from the humanistic National Geographic documentary. I sense Ridley's internal struggle as an atheist attempting to make a biblical movie. Because of this struggle, the movie of this scope has lost much of the authentic punch yet again.What is also missing was the notion of Sin. The OT is filled to the brim about this idea and many of the disciplinary actions executed by God were tightly-coupled to the sins committed by the people. The worshiping of the Golden Calf was a 1 second scene and nothing else was talked about it. In short, the notion of what is right and wrong was not touched.====================================================================To Hollywood directors who intend to make future biblical movies ==================================================================== Lastly, I hope that if there are more Hollywood directors and producers who intend to make more biblical movies in the future, please do more research into the Scriptures: 1) Understand the relationships between the humans and their God of the Scriptures 2) What is the single most important focus of the God in the Bible? 3) Scriptural quotations and authenticity mean a lot to believers 4) Right and Wrong, sin and righteousness are almost always black & white in the Scriptures. Evading from this subject matter or blurring things will make the foundation of your movie collapse to the ground. 5) Try experiencing God yourself before trying to depict His Words in movie will give your movies that much more influence on the viewers. Trust me, it will be displayed in your movies.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

But I found that oh yes you can! I'll make no bones about the fact that I am a Christian and read the Bible daily so I am more than familiar with the biblical version of Exodus. This was about as similar to it as chalk is to cheese! There are so many issues, I'd need an entire page on this website to list them all! But one that really stuck in my craw was when the Hebrews finally left Egypt. Rather than the many thousands organised under their 12 tribal banners (all the sons of Jacob, if you remember) it became a mindless troupe meandering through the streets - probably a number that would shame a Harrod's sale! And Moses declaring himself lost when so near the Red Sea? What was that all about? And no pillar of fire to keep the Egyptian Pharaoh and his army back. I could go on but I think you should be getting the picture! I watched it through to the end out of a sense of astonishment and was reminded of the other Biblical travesty ""Noah"" played by the infamous Russell Crowe - about as believable as a pantomime dame!

311,rhemie,Epic! Grand! Spectacular!,8,21 July 2015,"I can but think of one word - however short it might fall - to describe it: epic! Closing comments: Wow! That's pretty much all I can say. I've been rendered speechless after two and a half hours breathless.Unfortunately, it's not completely faultless. It is a little hard to chew in the beginning - a bit like old gum. It's too lose and feels a bit rushed. Too many lose ends. Too many unexplained metaphors and imagery. This can seem to go on forever as it does take a while to get to the good part: the start of the plagues. It's epic, large scaled, phenomenal and gripping. So much so, that by the time all the action comes to an end and the end credits role, you've forgotten about the lose ends and all you know is: it was a great film (especially in 3D - Wow!)Naturally, we all love villains. And even if you don't, there is absolutely no way you can walk away from this film and tell me you didn't like Rameses II. Joel Edgerton's performance and portrayal of the pharaoh was just stunning. A little too good actually. So much so, that it's very easy to admit Rameses was more likable that Moses. Which is actually quite sad. Not to say Christian Bale put on a bad performance, but... yeah, something was just totally wrong there. However, all those glitches are just minor downfalls. The creators of Noah could and should have learned something from the Exodus team.Closing thoughts: a definite must see. To really enjoy it, try and not compare it to The Prince of Egypt (however tempting that might be). I think Ridley Scott did an exceptional job!",Exodus - Gods and Kings

313,doctorcd2005,More a statement of director's view of the world today...,7,22 March 2015,"Rather than simply trying to tell an old testament biblical tale, this movie was another of Ridley Scott's exploration of human ideology and draws many parallels with what are experiencing in todays world of religious, political and economic extremism.Moses is a man outcast by affluent society because of his religious origin, stripped of all privilege and wealth and left to fend for himself in the desert. As the discontent grows, he finds motivation in a revelation by god of his role in life. From here begins a journey of piety that drives a revolution to overthrow his oppressors.We see one side, wealthy and prosperous, being guided by prophecies handed down by generations and another who are enslaved oppressed and hoping for salvation and delivery to the promised land. Ultimately their belief is this will come from devout obedience to an enigmatic leader who himself is guided by by a supreme being.The parallels of what we see today are striking. We see secret militia training camps. Tit for tat killings. Wars of attrition.If you were an Egyptian citizen, you might view the Pharoh as your leader and enforcer of law and order, whereas Moses would be the leader of a group of a brutal and violent regime of religious extremists that threaten the very fabric of what you call normal society.The scary part is that Moses' acts have the backing of a 'real' god.... which is exactly what extremists today believe support and drive their actions and is the message I think Mr Scott was trying to get across to the audience.Delivery wise, I found the visuals stunning and worth the experience in 3D. Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and Ben Kingsley deliver excellent performances, and we know Mr Scott, likes Sigourney Weaver, but she is simply too typecast for me to fit in the role of Queen.......",Exodus - Gods and Kings
314,daniell san,little disappointing,6,24 December 2014,"I went in to the movie with an open mind. I knew the story, but didn't know anything about the movie aside from having briefly seen the trailer once.The movie starts off with Moses and Ramses already as adults. I was glad to see that they didn't start from the beginning with the baby being put in a basket and so on...The acting in the movie was good. Most of the movie seemed to be good. There were problems with character development. I didn't feel any empathy for Moses or any of the other characters. You don't really get to see the suffering of the slaves and you don't get to understand why Moses feels he has to save his people, aside from God telling him to do so. I did like the parts where Moses and God were disagreeing on subjects.The movie also seemed to be skipping time a lot, like when Moses meets a girls, sees her twice (once from behind) and then they get married. When they got married, I didn't even know why they were both walking there and what they were about to do until the ceremony begun and then it didn't make any sense, since there was no courtship. I think the feeling that the movie skipped parts might have contributed to the lack of character development. Maybe important scenes were cut and somewhere out there is an extended director's cut that makes more sense than this version does.I read about complaints that white actors were cast in the roles of Egyptian people. It didn't really bother me that much. In the final scenes with Ramses however, Joel Edgerton really looks way too pale to be living in Egypt. Especially compared to the people surrounding him. It's not Joel Edgerton's fault, I think he's an amazing actor. But at the end he was almost glowing in the dark, that's how pale he was...I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's not terrible, but it just doesn't feel like a finished movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
315,xxXStarWarriorXxx,Ridley is Ridiculous,1,16 March 2015,"I was excited when it was first announced and wondered if it could be better than 'The Ten Commandments'. After seeing Noah (2014) I lowered my expectations but again I didn't expect it to be that bad as it was directed by Ridley Scott.This is just another money maker where Hollywood doesn't give a toss about story telling or following the book. The idea behind was to use the name ""Exodus"" to sell tickets to Christians, Jews, etc. Before they realise it's a load of rubbish, our folks in Hollywood have filled their pockets.In this version Moses has a freak accident on Mt Sinai breaks his legs and suffers head injuries and becomes delusional. You may think he's suffering from schizophrenia as he begins talking to an imaginary child.There is no God in this version, Moses is almost acting on his own. He decides to go back to Egypt and train Israelites in battle. In the meanwhile a bunch of crocodiles invade Nile and begin to devour every living creature, as a result it turns blood red. Flies come out of dead fish and frogs jump out of the river and so on, you get it. There is no parting of the Red Sea, the sea level just drops.This Moses has no staff but he's always carrying an Egyptian sword. He has a modern day haircut but sports a beard, which is ridiculous by the way. Bale is below average but I don't blame him, he wasn't really sure about his character and neither are we.Ramses looks confused from the beginning, no character development or emotion. You will find other brilliant actors wasted like Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver, with less than five mins of screen time. I don't know how it managed to get a rating of six plus, it doesn't even deserve a one.The character of Moses was completely misinterpreted and messed with. This is not the Exodus from the scriptures. There is no depth in this story or any of the characters. Most importantly God has no part to play in film. I saw Ridley Scotts' interview on TV when I was flipping channels and remember him saying, 'I can't do GOD'. This was unbelievable, then I wonder why he bothered with this project.I wouldn't recommend this anyone, religious or not. 'The Ten Commandments' remains the best Exodus movie ever. I would also recommend the animated version, 'Prince of Egypt' which is great for kids and adults.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

There are some people who consider that this movie should have been split in two parts but I say that it is quite good how it was made so far. The story is great, the movie captivates you from the beginning and even tho you know the story line you will still have some moments when you will wait to see what happens. There are some impressive scenes which I don't need/want to describe here, but trust me that it will surprise you in a good way. Maybe you will not take the movie as rated with 9 as I do, but at least an 8 I hope that you will find it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
317,platomd,Exodus: A Movie Lost in the Wilderness,5,15 December 2014,"Radically different than prior versions of this story Exodus brings great shame to a magnificent biblical saga. Scripted to deviate from prior incarnations Exodus wanders through a series of sequences looking for a story that never develops. With horrible acting and poorly designed back lot sets the audience is degraded as the movie unfolds. Christian Bale should have remained with the Batman series instead of sullying himself with this dreck of a film. John Turturro plays Seti, ruler of Egypt and beyond. He should have stayed in Brooklyn making bagels in Transformers. God has been diminished to a tertiary role, which will make all atheist viewers happy. To reveal these sequences would spoil a film that spoils itself. As the cast moves from scene to scene the thousands of extras appear disconnected from the director's cues. For biblical purists I am still searching for a scene that comes near one event as originally told in this great work. Charlton Heston, the renown Moses of the 1050s, would have laughed off this script if offered to him. In a sense we have one of the best biblical tales treated to some of the worst Hollywood has to offer. My vote of 5 out of 10 is stated not to offend the acting of the mass numbers of extras. At nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes this film is 2 hours and 30 minutes too long.Mark Davis President of Davis Writing Services. www.daviswritingservices.com.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
318,gabriel_kh,"Rod, not a sword",1,12 December 2014,"I like Ridley Scott's movies. Actually I went to watch ""Exodus"" only because he was the director. However, in my humble opinion Ridley Scott shouldn't even thought about filming this movie. It was ridiculously inaccurate in many details. Eg. Moses didn't kill two Egyptians but one, he fled to desert and was not exiled there, he spent not 9 years but 40 yrs in the desert, the Bible never says that Moses used a sword! Aaron used to talk before each plague to Pharaoh and in the movie even Moses doesn't do that, and that humiliating image of God being a child and that kiddish dialogue between Moses and God, etc. So the whole interpretation of the story of Exodus is pretty much diverted in this movie. Now the question is, why take an information from a certain source if you are going to completely divert it? Better be more creative than just diverting a story. Pass.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
319,carolynpickering,"Poor casting, lack of emotional depth",3,5 December 2014,"Why would Ridley Scott cast an Englishman, an Australian, an American and an Irishman in the biblical story of the Exodus? Does the previous line sounds like the start of a joke? Well unfortunately the joke is on the audience with this visually stunning but shallow 3 hour flick. While the performances were good, the casting was way off. I like Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and Sigorney Weaver but they are just wrong for their roles and so was the Irishman within Ramses' group of advisor's. I could not get past this miscasting (why not cast Middle Eastern actors in these major roles?). Character development was almost non existent and in the end I cared more for those being smited than any of the main characters which came off as petulant war mongers (including the child representing God to Moses). Perhaps that was Ridley Scott's point. A disappointing ticket purchase from this respected Director. Barely DVD fodder.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
320,Nitesh_Singh,Short of Troy and 300 but watchable.,7,13 December 2014,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is for the audience who are interested in history of religions and civilizations. If one does not come under this category he may not enjoy the movie.The title could have been Gods vs Kings to justify the storyline. In the starting it appears that the story will revolve around fight between Moses(Christian Bale) and Ramasses(Joel Edgerton) but is actually clash between the God and Ramasses.The story may have been derived from Abrahamic Religion's books but in the movie the act of God against Egyptians alone is not justified. Why God has suddenly started feeling for Hebrews and killing every other creature in the process is questionable. Egyptian children are killed on a night by some magic shadow in the sky, instead the goal could have been reached by killing Ramsses alone.The first half of the movie is gripping and interesting. The second half starts becoming dull and the end of the story is over extended. Had the movie been made on the footprints of Troy or 300, it would have been more interesting to all audience. In the end it seems like story of some religious movement.All actors have performed their roles very well and it could not have been done any better.The set and the graphics used for the movie are mind blowing and at par with big-budget movies.

The Godly horrors known as plagues are a cinematic jaw dropping experience but when it returns to the actual drama. Oh brother. How can it possibly be?

322,pluslife,Save Your Money! Though does show God as the Petty Child it is...,3,21 December 2014,"Ignore the fear the movie is rated low just do to the Religious Fanatics; it is just very badly made movie and total waste of time.I only went to see it do to Christian Bale speaking out on how nuts much of the bible is and figured there might be some quality versus indoctrination into books full of myths, hypocrisies, perverted truths, factual inaccuracies with a genocidal God who favors one people over another written by no one which the books are named for or by anyone who saw, experienced or knew those which they write and promote as God's very word and yet knew little of what he created obviously. But hey lets not allow facts to get in the way of conditioned beliefs used to control people by Constantine and his council of boot licking stooges and has been used ever since then by governing bodies if religious or not to control and manipulate society with fears of some God's wrath. Movie does show how God of the Bible is no more than a 10 year old brat with psychotic mood swings at best and likely a psychopathic murderous failure; whom either knows and knew everything but failed or could careless about his creation anymore than a child with a fish tank. Gotta have it and then has lost interest at best and likely if true is no more than a petty nut job who toys with his creation for sadistic enjoyments. Since he claims to made it all then he made sin to and he allows sin for his own desires of which even man can see is sin and criminal. Sadly we have the so many conditioned to see God only when good things happen and blame the devil/Satan or mankind when bad things happen; which means they the deity wants it both ways like a child or petty tyrant. Guess we are his whipping boys for this Biblical God; he gets all the praise and favor but we pay for all his errors and mistakes! So this is supposed to be God the Father, which if God was on earth today it would be convicted for war crimes, criminal neglect of his children and many other atrocities... Sheesh!!!Being I knew the Foaming at the Mouth Religious would be unhinged towards the movie since Christian Bale spoke out about how he felt Moses was mental; as such I ignore the ratings! Wow; gave the nut jobs to much power, the sad rating for the wealth of actor resources and millions wasted on this movie is too kind. Seen better made for TV Specials than this movie. The only value I saw was a lesson for future cinematic students on how to waste millions of dollars with tons of acting talent at hand, while leaving you audience aggravated having wasted precious time in peoples life and ones limited financial resources.Now I remember why I stay home and wait for stuff to come out on some other media format besides going to the cinema rip off scheme we are dealt by corporate America today and they wonder why such is failing. Low quality movies; nasty germy sticky accommodations, 20$ for 2$ worth of snacks and rude peers whom can not show manners much less even put their silly cell phones down long enough to watch a movie they paid for and other have paid for to see without being harassed by frenetic spoiled brats in adult bodies often so obese they are the size of livestock. I did not go to see the movie sitting next to a cow infringing on my space I paid for with mooing on their cell phone and frantically poking away on it while lighting the theater up like the starship enterprise from digital devices in the hands of childish adults. It does not cost a penny to show decency, have common sense and shut your distracting activity's down; grow up instead of out. And no I am not old; I am in my early 20's and tired of spoiled and rude adults and people blame the kids when they need to look right at where such is learned and allowed, parents who refuse to control their kids they brought in this world and expect us to care for them and tolerate their rude behavior forced on us!Keep your fat rolls in your chair, your legs on your side, shut up, clean up after yourself and your cell phone is your business and keep it that way we are not interested drama and you do not look or seem important yakking on your cell or pecking away at it; such behavior is pure low brow and sign of low class which has nothing to do with financial wealth but social values which I find the worst and rudest offenders often are those who claim some deity as their savior.So movie is a 3 and people attending movie is a -10!PS: Yet what can you expect from a society which still holds fast unto fables and proved falsity as their truths and allow themselves to be used by manipulative entities as if they were still some peasant from the 3rd century with no access to knowledge! No wonder we take one step forward and 2 backwards; such needless dead-weight dragging us back into ignorance and the refusal to learn from the past regardless if near or far away!

323,sdfnhwpfwgwlgv,TOP CLASS HISTORICAL FILM,8,7 November 2020,"What Ridley Scott has delivered here is just great. Emotionally upsetting, with epic scenes and a damn good soundtrack. And yes, I see the length of 150 minutes as the only real point of criticism. Because hardly any other biography like that of Moses is so epic that a Hollywood blockbuster is the only right one. But here a length of over 3 hours would have been more appropriate to deepen the individual characters, of which there are quite a lot, which unfortunately was only mediocre. Otherwise, one can easily feverish the story, although one knows it and although the first half of the film is only ""good"" from a dramatic point of view, which is above all because the sufferings of the Hebrews are not shown intensely enough. Some people criticize Ridley Scott for not exactly sticking to the biblical facts here. I think he's doing it just right. Just as he showed new approaches with Alien, which were not particularly well received, he is going the same way here. This gives a film whose story is generally known a certain unpredictability and freshness.
Thank you Ridley for this movie experience.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

325,under-represented,Exodus: Slow and boring,2,12 December 2014,"I didn't have high expectation from this movie. The trailer was unimpressive and the reviews on IMDb and Metacritic were low. Sometimes having such low expectation is good thing, you set your expectation so low that movie may surpass it. This, however, was not the case with Exodus. First, the lighting was low for first 30 minutes or so. The battle scene in the beginning was ruined because of brightness issue. I don't know if it was my theater or movie itself.The bad thing about making movie based on a book is there is no excitement about the events. If it's a modern day novel you can avoid spoilers by not reading the books, but it gets worse for mythology like Exodus. It may sometimes be interesting to know a director's take on a particular character (like Nolan's Batman). Here, I didn't know the back-story of Moses (sorry, I am from India, our mythological stories are different) so I thought may be I'll like how Moses became what he is. Except, it was like Gladiator all over again.Without an interesting story and banal characters, there was nothing to pull off the movie. Yes, there were some interesting special effects, but they didn't show anything extraordinary (no, new world like Avatar or space like interstellar). I was amazed by the Egyptian world in Mummy, however fake it was, but it was the first time. Now it just look obvious.The acting was OK, the story didn't provide enough meat to showcase good emotional moments so no standing out acting moment from anyone. Dialogs felt so modern that it was distracting. Every now and then I was wondering would someone from that period will use this phrase? The accent was inconsistent. The God character had a British accent! Why?? Finally, most disappointing thing was to see Aaron Paul doing such insignificant role. Man! that guy has so much potential, this movie was almost mocking him - take my money and be indistinguishable in a beard.I didn't like the movie but my wife did.

328,chantal-ashford,Exodus: A Mockery,1,22 December 2014,"I was truly disappointed with this film. I wasn't worried about the whitewashing with this film. I didn't care about that at all. When I went into this film, I was believing it to BE the story of the book of Exodus in the Bible, BUT I didn't get that. If you don't know what it is: it is about Moses, the man who was raised by the Pharaoh and his wife, but as the child becomes a man, he learns the actual truth of him being a Hebrew, killing a man because he was beating a Hebrew slave before running away, and later down the line he was chosen by God to come back to his ""brother"" Rameses and have him let his people go... What did I get? I get a man's interpretation of this story. It was nothing like what I was taught from the Bible. When people go to see this that hasn't read the Bible and go see this film, they're going to believe that Moses was some crazy man after getting his head knocked and come to, speaking of speaking to God with this mission, going back to free the slaves, but with war and not peace. I mean, this is what I get when the director is an atheist...Yes, I am a religious person, and this film is a disappointment.

330,rid-diego,Exodus: Gods & Kings - or how Fox funded a revisionist take on the Bible,8,28 March 2015,"Let's make things clear: this is -most definitely- not you Sunday school story on Exodus. Yes, it is made by an atheist/agnostic (Ridley Scott, director of Kingdom of Heaven) and, possibly, written by another one (Steven Zaillian). At first, considering Noah was, even without the controversial material, a very religious-themed movie, I wondered how Ridley Scott, the man who directed the very atheistic/agnostic character of Balian in Kingdom of Heaven, could make a straight up religious movie in Exodus. I feared it would be a remake/update to The Ten Commandments. Boy, I shouldn't have doubted. Being an atheist myself, I actually find movies like Ben-Hur and the aforementioned Cecil B. De Mille's film like grand, sweeping (and tediously long) epic masterpieces. I do have conflict with the overtly obvious religious message but I shield myself from them. But after watching this movie I stood in awe, among other things, how FOX, a notoriously conservative entertainment corporation (see the scandals about an alien side-boob on Mass Effect a few years ago for reference), funded a $140 million (without promotion) revisionist take on the Bible. Because what Scott and Zaillian do here is just masterful. Not only they play with the notion that ""God"" is a manifestation of Moses conscience (after discovering himself a Hebrew he probably feels guilty about how the Egyptians mistreat his people) and, representing him as a child, as an immature entity susceptible to mood swings and tantrums; they also play with the tendency people have to find patterns in isolated events: for instance, the plagues (scientifically explained by Ewen Bremner's character), a storm and a tsunami happening relatively close to each other, may present a pattern to an outside observer. On the other hand, I think that the strongest part this movie has lies on the fact (apparently lost on most reviews I've read) how the Egyptian people suffered during the plagues, including Rameses (one of the most emotional scenes is the moment when he founds his son dead on his bed, an angle of the character never before explored in previous renditions of the story), and the inner conflict it causes on Moses (he grew up among them, after all). But, despite the high concept, this is the tale about two brothers that, despite their differences, you can see they still care for each other and how every decision they are forced to take against them is painful to make, something completely unexplored in previous versions of the story. And so, you find so fitting and touching that this movie is dedicated to Ridley's late brother Tony who died in 2012. This movie is not perfect though. As thoroughly noted in IMDb's goofs section, there are several anachronisms and factual errors that are mostly cosmetics and should not deter your enjoyment of the story, especially when you find yourself absorbed on the world Ridley has created and the way he shoots it (most of what happens on screen is real, even when you take into account the huge amount of visual effects this movie has). More glaring though, is the fact that you can see that this movie was trimmed before release and it surely has a ton of material to flesh out some characters (some of the important but barely there) and fill the reported 4 hour cut Ridley Scott submitted first. But, despite these flaws, Scott and co. have crafted a thoroughly enjoyable epic, way above his effort on Robin Hood. I recommend watching this movie if you are not offended by a more ""factually focused"" point of view and/or don't expect to see a faithful rendition of the Bible. If so, this movie is definitely not for you. Otherwise, this is another of Ridley Scott's underrated gems in his filmography.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
331,shrikar-v,Painfully boring,4,15 March 2015,"Wow this movie was so boring. It was rather painful to try and sit through the entire thing, so I spared myself the last 30 minutes of what seemed like 14 hours. I suppose it was well shot, but there was entirely too much drama, all of which was contrived. There were too few plot building shots, for instance his marriage, and his 5 year old kid in the next scene, it was all a bit randomly paced. Bale's acting was good I suppose, until he tried to seem paternal which was a spectacular failure. It was funny that Moses resorted to what may be defined in modern day diction as terrorism after training the Jews how to fight as an army. I choose to stray away from the aspect of religion completely, I don't care whether the script followed the book in this case.. it would probably still be boring anyway. Bottom line, I'd recommend this movie if you were on a first date and trying to get some action, the girl would probably take any distraction to save her brain from being wasted away by boredom.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The plot is heavily focused on Moses, rendered in this movie as a somewhat reluctant crusader than as a prophet with a purpose by Christian Bale. The other actors, and there are some big names here, seem very superficial. It almost seems like Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver and Aaron Paul are jobbers because they appear at a particular moment, say their lines dutifully and make a quiet exit. But the one thing this movie has going for it is the special effects. They are an absolute treat. I also liked the touch of reality added to the ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea making them appear as though they are believable natural disasters. But the character of God seems like a misfire at times. I feel the movie could have benefited from the thunderous voice used to perfection in 'The Prince of Egypt' rather than the surly ten year old who represents the Lord and his infinite majesty in this adaptation. There is nothing wrong with this movie and I would always go back for these kinds of special effects but a healthy dose of emotion is what it basically lacks. This movie doesn't care that you don't care about its characters. So that guy just parted a freaking sea? Meh.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

How delightful to actually see sarcasm, cynicism & defiance in them...everyone from Pharoah's son to the rather excellent slimy Viceroy for a change - far more truer to human nature.I don't expect to see a religion-based film & be converted to that faith or walk out of the theatre turned into a 'true believer' & that's not what I saw here as the intention...just the best version of the classic tale so far retold for the modern age. Less of the thunder bolts & lightning / booming voice of god routine & more focus onto a far more believable simple, honest man that took some convincing as to his origins, but then gave his all to the cause (with some top FX thrown in)...well I enjoyed it, lighten up guys!",Exodus - Gods and Kings

335,jhilton0907,Great take on the Biblical story,9,30 August 2015,"Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to review the 2014 Biblical movie, Exodus: Gods and Kings. After the failure that was Noah, I was worried that this movie would follow the same path as Noah took. I was very glad, that I was wrong. Exodus was not just a good Biblical movie, but also a good take from Hollywood. Now this is also based on my Christian faith, so I will try not to reveal a lot of spoilers but do be warned.One, the story was amazing... the begins with the Egyptians going into battle with the Hittites. Then we see the land of Egypt and Moses learning of his heritage. The movie clearly follows the story of Moses, but presents us a different version, a realistic take on the story. If you are familiar with the story, then you should be able to see the story in the movie. So, main question... is the completely accurate to the Bible... the answer is, sadly no, but it is more Biblical than Noah in every way possible. The Battle with the Hittites is clearly added to make the story epic or in my view, a way to show Egypt going into battle. Another addition is Moses attacking the Egyptians to force Ramses to let the Hebrews go. That part was not in the Bible, same goes with the battle of the Hittites. Another scene I did not like much was the scene when the waters of Egypt turn to blood... I find that part to be completely unrealistic, as if it was crocodiles that help turned the waters to blood, then there needs to be a lot more people shown being eaten by the crocodiles, making the scene more realistic. How it was shown didn't bring any justice to the movie, but believe me, this movie is worth watching.Second, the cast was outstanding. Christian Bale did a fantastic job as Moses. It ain't no easy job playing Moses, so we all should give Christian a break, as he did fantastic and made this Moses just as lovable as the Biblical Moses. Joel Edgerton was also amazing as Ramses. Ben Kingsley did a great job as Nun, but I do feel that some of the bigger characters like Joshua and Aaron deserved more of a part in the film, but the actors that played them did a good job as them. I also feel that people should have worried about the Biblical accuracy rather than race of the characters. In my view, as long as they played the characters good, it doesn't matter what race they are. To me, anyone can be a good actor, it just takes time and lots of work, and everyone in this movie has earned that.So how accurate is this movie to the Biblical story... well, here is my valuation. There is some major changes to the story such as how the Red Sea was split and the prior changes I mentioned. Overall, I give this movie a Biblical Accuracy of 75%, making this way better than the accuracy I gave Noah, which is a low 15%. My final thoughts on the movie are this, I was completely amazed by how Ridley portrayed the events. If there was a director that could make a good or descent movie about Noah, I would have preferred Ridley Scott over Darren Aronofsky... at least he respects the Bible more. Now for my final rating on the film... I give this 9 out of 10 stars. It would have been a solid 10 if it wasn't for the Biblical inaccuracies, but sadly, no movie is perfect. My advice to those who want to see this movie, please be sure to read the story as well, since there is some major differences between this and the story.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
336,spavlakovic-934-975905,Visually genius but overloaded movie spectacle,7,12 July 2015,"Firstly, when I prepare myself for the movie, I was picturing older movies with the religion in the forefront. Watching this movie is like watching an Jurrasic park, visually spectacular and everything is going allong the religious plan but all of the time you have a feeling that religion have been put on the side. Although this is much better for the movie profits and don't get me wrong, this is the best Moses movie till now, I would still prefere some part of originality and biblical authenticity in the movie. Parts which looks authentical are those which give you inside what was like to be a pharaon or peasant at that time and you will enjoy it.Go ahead, watch the movie and have fun, especially for the kids it will be awesome so it will be maybe trigger to read the real story.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
337,BeavisMoon,"Enjoyable film--ignore the bible-thumping haters (it's Hollywood, what do you expect?)",7,12 March 2015,"After deciding to ignore the bad reviews on IMDb, I watched this movie and was thoroughly pleased. Sure there are parts of the story that they could have done a better job with, (the plagues seem kinda rushed, and are a really cool part of the story), but come on-- trying to pack thousands of years of history into a 2 hour movie is very difficult, and I think they did OK. Who cares if it doesn't stick exactly to what the bible says etc, again ITS A MOVIE meant for visual enjoyment, not for studying historical accuracy (well not really historical, as none of this really ever happened). The movie relies heavily on Christian Bale's butt-kicking capabilities and overall badassery, and he, as usual, does not let us down. Honestly, this movie was entertaining, and made me interested in the tale itself (im not much of a bible- reader, obviously). Sure its kinda cheesy, being a Hollywood blockbuster, but again, that was to be expected! I will probably watch it again to show it to my girlfriend. Overall, I liked it, and think it's ridiculous how angry bible-thumpers got about it.. Don't let the reviews dissuade you-- Enjoy! :)",Exodus - Gods and Kings
338,mcdopeshow,What a Wasted Opportunity,5,15 March 2015,"It's the next day and I'm still wondering if it was just me and a tired after work Saturday. I gave it a good night sleep to digest and eventually headed here, my (our) bible of movie lovers to read what others made of this movie. I now hold a mix of feelings.It's indeed amazing looking. When it starts, it grabs you by the eyes and imagination. Egypt is back. Richly colored, amazingly sumptuous, perhaps an exaggeration of our best dreams - but then again, Cinema is entitled to such exaggerations.Then the movie starts. And it mostly starts to disappoint you at every turn. Indeed Bale is beyond his best performances, Sigourney Weaver barely has two lines (what a waste) and all in all the performances are soulless, empty, on a storyline that seems to be more worried about rushing to all the events that God casts - don't even get me started on the figure - than in adding depth, caring to these same characters.It's in fact and my feeling that this was an enormous wasted opportunity, whereas the lack of movies touching this subject has been silent for years and finally, once you gather such a director, cast and budget, you go and waste it in ridiculous-looking CGI and under performing movie stars.It's not a bad movie, no. It's just average. And average is the least you expect when you combine all these things together, where you had so many chances to dig deeper and make a great movie.I'm indeed sadden. And as I've read, so many of you are too.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
339,brin-t-murray,Lacked the final spark for greatness,7,11 July 2015,"As other reviewers have said - great CGI and visuals, terrific world building, and a fine leading actor despite the carping that he didn't look Jewish enough. The way the story was taken, treading a fine line between biblical magic and realism - every event could theoretically have been explained by natural events, almost, except for the death of the first born sons - was creative and for me worked better than a magical miracle approach. Moses and Exodus is a great story, taken simply as a story: it spoke to the slaves of the American South and became symbolic of their predicament many centuries later. So why did it fail to completely grab the heart and appeal to the emotions, in say the way Gladiator did? Two simple reasons. First, poor secondary characterization - we never get to know any of the oppressed Hebrews. Ben Kingsley is woefully underused, he makes a brief introduction and then disappears. Moses' mother and sister have a brief reunion with him and then disappear. Aaron is introduced to Moses as his brother and then virtually disappears. You can't care about freeing people if all you know of them is cities and hillsides of ant-like multitudes swarming, with the occasional close-up of corpses burning or bloody floggings. You need to know them as people. The Hebrews are essentially faceless, invisible victims. This is no reflection on the actors; it's poor screen writing. Second, the music. Flat, boring, without power or affect. Every really powerful movie has music that moves: the soundtrack is pedestrian.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
340,edubarca46-1,Confusing and not very accurate,2,14 March 2015,"It is inevitable to compare this movie with Cecil B. DeMille's masterpiece ""The Ten Commandments"" of 1956. DeMille's version is full of rich filming and dialog with an impacting soundtrack and wonderful acting. It is a coherent film and its special effects are now legend. This 2014 version has a bad script, is very confusing and needs a lot of concentration to follow. It also misses very important happenings according the the Holy Scriptures. The Moses character is way out of the Bible's description and the acting is not very convincing. Charlton Heston's rendering of Moses is perhaps the best. Let's do not forget that the Ten C. was made in 1956 as a big film made to compete against TV so it was really a full spectacle. The parting of the Red Sea on Exodus is not at all convincing and as stated before, the plagues are poorly made. Also, I missed the scenes when Moses received the Ten Commandments from the Lord and when the Jewish corrupt before the Holy Mountain both beautifully filmed by DeMille. Moreover, I think that a small child is not the best representation of God. Remember the beautiful scene in the Ten C.with the voice of Heston and the burning bush. They just don't make them as they used to.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
341,sverige-icebaby,Ridley Scott has misfired.,1,8 December 2014,"Awful, awful movie. Christian Bale is mediocre, Joel Edgerton is surprisingly good, but the rest of it sucks. The whole thing lacked any kind of oomph. No spectacular Red Sea parting, none of the atmosphere of such a great and legendary story. Just an atheist agenda pushing along a sad little pram of replacement theories. Truly, truly dreadful. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. Don't waste your money. People with Scott's attitude toward the Bible should steer clear of anything to do with it. He has some personal issues he needs to deal with inside a therapist's office, and not with the funding provided by movie backers. Get over it, Ridley. You're a sad little man.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
342,siru-tirronen,Pomposity became the destroyer of gods and kings,7,6 January 2015,"Exodus: Gods and Kings has had very bad luck during the whole filming time and now when we see the final result we see its effects. Ridley Scott has had critics because of the lack of middle east actors/actresses in main roles. But still the movie isn't not so bad. It has very much potential but lost it before half way the story. The movie starts slow but when the first battle has been won the story really begin. And if the movie would have been only a history film I think it could have been very good film. The relationship between Moses and Ramses was interesting and if Scott had focused more on it than describing their use of power by using force this movie would have been completely different. Exodus: Gods and Kings are not Ridley Scott's masterpiece(for me it is always Bladerunner) but he can play well with the visuals. However they are one of the movie's weakness because this film has way too much special effectives on it. Too much war scenes, I would prefer this movie just be a drama film because Moses was not a warrior, he was a speaker and believer/prayer. And for me it almost looked like he had copied some of the visual effects/meanings from Aronofsky's Noah like when Moses was buried under mud in the scene of the burning bush etc. The acting in the movie was good. Christian Bale played his role pretty well (few scenes were bad still) but overall he made the film worth of watching. Actor who played Ramses was not bad, he started well but his character stayed only lazy, cruel and careless. But I must say that Sigourney Weaver could have been out of this movie because of her role. It was so small and she didn't talk much and was she in more scenes than 5 in this movie? Such pity, it really smelled more like advertising this film than acting. But I think the movie is not so bad than everybody says but it has serious flaws on it. But nowadays every time when you're making movie about religious story you will get bad reviews. But that I can't understand that if he starts the movie boldly for making us to believe that Moses didn't believe religious things why he couldn't keep that up in the end of the movie? He was criticizing but suddenly in the middle of the film he stopped it. WHY? Wasn't he brave enough? If he had been, I would have given more stars for him.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
343,neighborlee_fromPalmer,Inspiration tale of faith not for children,9,1 November 2015,"I watched movie regardless of 'critiques', because while its often helpful to see opinions from others, we aren't all created equal in terms of how we all turn out, and have vastly divergent upbringings not to mention lives created by various circumstances , so having said that: First off I am a Christian, which is most certainly not a prerequisite , just a fact and wanted to be transparent.I've seen 'Exodus' before when Charlton Heston wowed us in the first version but has ruined it or me with his visible support of certain issues. Your mileage may vary, but that's how it affected me, and my father was a hunter so its not like I've never seen a gun, but I was also raised to consider personal responsibility.We all have a responsibility to present not just ourselves but truth forward as well, and while I was enjoying watching this exodus, I became horrified during certain scenes , mainly the crocodile scene.We all know the bible contains war and death, but also compassion and a sense not of only a GOD ever present and hopeful for mankind's evolution and a present parent guiding ones children into a often dangerous but life full of possibilities and beauty.I am not a bible expert, but I knew the 'crocodile' scene was nonsense, and I knew why.I knew it was a insert, and thus accepted it for that given audiences often desire action scenes and few might not give high ratings to a otherwise 'boring' movie without it (?), but this Christian could have done without them because most everyone knows unless they were there to witness Exodus and provide proof, that the inserted scene was Hollywood.History, yes, is written and filtered through a lens of as much fact based observation as man can draw upon and surely sometimes we may well get it wrong , but this scene and no other, assured me I could not give it a '10'.Ridley Scott claims his reason for the crocodile scene was information he obtained from a consultant, and though for factual purposes I not show that here, do yourselves a favor and do a internet search for verification.Given that, my criticism of the 'crocs' will be tempered , but given the bible has no mention of any of this means I will place it where it belongs, which is 'one' source believes this, they may or may not be correct, and it just adds to theories put forth as part of a narrative of history we are all trying to grapple with.Apart from the few places where 'GOD' as the child is willfully wanting to see them 'on their knees' and let the slaves go as a result, the depiction of GOD as a child should concern no one, as God being our creator of all we know, we can all assume has liberty with form , and considering children are often sadly innocent victims in not just war but community injustices of all kinds, I felt the portrayal very appropriate and moving.One scene which as a vegan I found rather disturbing, was when the lambs( Passover) were being slaughtered and the writers make it clear to showcase that, I felt possibly in the producers viewpoint asking questions about why this action would be necessary to 'filter' a group of people from harm , was a purposeful insert to acquire reaction, and I feel deservedly.I later thought to myself as movie was coming to an end, how does a teacher, an adult or here, GOD, 'teach' compassion to one another, how is it done to usher in new eras of respect for oneself and ones neighbor and all others we share this earth with, in ways that will be everlasting and hold back violence all at a time when such barbarity was present ? Thankfully today we raise our children without force but love , firm but loving discipline and lots of otherwise TLC.I can't be the judge of that time nor do I want to, but what I am sure of is that once we got past the plagues and Moses spoke of not being a conqueror and more a man of peace and civility out of practicality ( liberal writing freedom?) the desire at least for peace had a foothold.I loved the ending as God as the child merged in with the crowds, and C. Bale as Moses looked back for support, and knowing God was leaving him now to be on his own, hopeful for a bright future for mankind all while wondering if he could really pull it off was a scene that tugged at my heart.I go forward myself , alone in one respect that my parents are gone yet ever present I feel somehow, urging me on into a yes often violent world, yet full of capacity for compassion and empathy.These are the things I think of as relates to a parents wish for their children or in this case, a God ; and while the movie is too harsh for young eyes, it certainly warms the heart for the promise of a hopeful, kinder future where we all thrive, together with all our uniqueness toward a future of equals, on the hopeful nudge from a loving yet firm creator that the wish for humanity yields success.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

345,whistler118,Unremarkable - The Fall of Ridley Scott?,6,6 March 2015,"Like any Ridley Scott film, Exodus promised big budget, big action, big story culminating into what can only be described as a traditional'epic' blockbuster. Unfortunately, Exodus fails to meet this status, bringing to question whether the stigma attached to the director is still justified. The film, based on the story of Moses, follows the same beaten track of films and stories before. The story is both familiar but repetitive with only small twists which attempt to relate to a modern and largely un-religious audience. Its on this I must make a side note, films based on religious beliefs instantly ring alarm bells; they either are ridiculous (Noah for example), overly religious or tame. Exodus is the latter, tame. It attempts to carefully tiptoe around anything that could be controversial resulting in a product that falls short of even the 1998 cartoon 'Prince of Egypt'. However, a familiar but tame story can usually be saved by inspiring acting and interesting character development. Unfortunately, this is exodus' biggest failing. The story focused on two individuals, Moses and Ramses, with almost no development of any other character. Christian Bale's performance as Moses let much to be desired and was completely unsuited to the role of an inspirational leader. Its because of his un-remarkable acting and script that results in large pieces of the film being instantly forgettable. The same can be said about all of the main supporting actors whose only role was to provide exposition when the story required it. The multiple award winning Aaron Paul barely has a line of speech throughout the one hundred and fifty minute film as an example. In spite of this Exodus does have a few redeeming features that return it from a disaster. The graphics and special effects are fantastic and coupled with the more down to earth and modern portrayal of the ten plagues of Egypt its creates a more relatable film. This results in that feeling of grandeur and 'epicness' one expects from such a film. A special note must go to the acting of Joel Edgerton, Ramses, who breathes fresh life into the film, or at least his part of it, through immersive and inspiring acting. He plays the role of an increasingly desperate king perfectly and is a joy to watch. Overall, Exodus leaves the viewer with mixed opinions. It is not a bad film, its well constructed and had a mixture of good and bad points, but its not a good film either. The biggest criticism is that its boring. I was very rarely gripped and never excited as to what might happen next. Too often does the film descend into slow, uninteresting and unnecessary plot development scenes which became a chore to get through. After the similarly disappointing releases from Ridley Scott in the last few years I have to conclude that he may have seen his best days. I have given this film a 6/10 as it does have the essence of an 'epic' blockbuster but its delivery poorly done.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
346,ba-842-642958,Noah was bad..... this is even worse.,1,11 March 2015,"There's a clear trend in Hollywood these days, discredit and distort all of the great stories in the Bible. Tell them the way you want them to be, not the way they are written down.Exodus: Gods and Kings is the latest effort in this quest. Noah was pretty bad, but this is even worse. What's wrong with these directors in Hollywood? Can't they just stick to the story, which is great in itself? It's very obvious that whoever wrote the script for this movie has no respect for God at all and doesn't even understand the concept of God. Which fool would even follow the god displayed in this movie? Seriously.... God displayed as an annoying, proud brat... a mean and creepy looking child? Wow.... I just wish they left the whole word exodus out of the title and changed the characters names, since this movie has nothing today with the story in Exodus at all.On top of that, the cast is just wrong and there's something wrong about all of the characters. Moses (contrary to the real one) tries to play the hero, but utterly fails. Farao is such a wimp that they would have replaced him (to put it nicely) ages ago. I'm not even going to mention the rest of the badly chosen actors and characters.A complete waste of time, I just can't believe people even are willing to see this kind a junk..... they should all ask their money back.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Well spoken Bale in anciet Eygptian times using proper queens English just sounds and feels odd.The film then labours through Moses early life, armed battles, brotherly love, betrayal, marriage, messages from God (first one strangely handed down whilst being buried in mud and by a young boy) to Moses fumbling - never leading - his way to Eqypt to free the slaves. It is awful in every possible sense and puzzling for it being delivered by the hand (no pun intended) of Ridley Scott.Along with Aronofsky, Ridley has failed terribly to bring a biblical story to the modern day audience.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
348,ajaysinghjaswal-133-244502,The Great Ridley Scott Touch is Missing Here...,5,7 December 2014,"With the advancement of creative world and growth of technology, the great directors and actors feel the need to jump into the realm of old scriptures and gods. And why should they not? They have the money, resources and already available audience to deliver whatever the previous makers lacked in rendering. Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe, Darren Aronofsky, Christopher Spencer were all succumbed to this desire. So what stops a director of brilliant motion pictures, such as Blade Runner and Alien, to adore the gods with his own innovations? There is nothing wrong in doing so, especially, when you want to praise 'thy lord' with the best available resources you have. The problem becomes when these resources get more praise than 'thy lord.' And this is the ill-fate of this movie. Spectacular visuals, detailed imaginativeness of the Egyptian palaces and Hebrew slums, as well as convincing special effects of war scenes, especially Ramses chasing Moses and the party. I am also of the mind that it was a right choice to make movie in 3D. Screening of magnanimousness of Egyptian structures, cities, armies and the plagues of god would not have been possible otherwise. Unfortunately, the very core of the story is submerged under all of these elements.The movie lacks in every way that motion pictures are mainly known for. Lack of emotions failed to bind the audience to the story. The story itself is quite straightforward. We all know the story anyway but the Ridley Scott touch of Gladiator has apparently escaped from this narration of history. It is difficult to relate to the characters when the whole persona is represented by Hollywood cast. I can understand that you cannot sell such high budget movie by putting it on the shoulders of unknown non-Hollywood actors. But give me a break here. Not every actor is made for every character. Except Ben Kingsley, of course. Don't get me wrong, Sigourney Weaver is also a great actor but can you imagine her as an Egyptian queen. I think she got this role only for the old time sake (Alien resonance, I believe).Even bigger joke is John Turturro playing the character as a pharaoh. I can't even imagine him besides being an FBI agent or a con artist. But the saddest part is Christian Bale is not very convincing in his role. Remember the feeling that 'no one else can play this role better than Bale?' Unfortunately, this feeling is also awry here. Anybody could have played Moses. Or for that matter, even better.Joel Edgerton, on the other hand, met the needed expectations of a tyrant pharaoh's character. In some parts, I could see him overwhelming Bale, with his exaggerated volatile expressions. Just what he had done in a scene to Leonardo DiCaprio in The Great Gasby. If you compare this movie to Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ you will see where this movie lacks and will understand that you certainly don't need great technologies to narrate a great biblical episode. Besides the visuals, the originality of Egyptian and Hebrew hostility is greatly missing in this movie. I'd rather recommend to watch it on TV when it comes there. It will help you to sleep.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

I did get a different take of a fairytale but other than that, it didn't entertain me.A very dull story to begin with, became even duller. All the 'cool' effects of bombardment, that a large portion of the audience was waiting for, failed to materialize before them. At least in any interesting and dramatic way that we were all imagining.

After watching the movie, all I can say is the latest venture of this popular filmmaker has failed to impress me. This is probably the worst film made by the ace director.The movie does nicely in showing the vast kingdom of Egypt. The huge and fantastic set pieces depicts the ancient city of Egypt beautifully. The 3-D is nicely executed and the battle sequences with the horses and the chariots flying with speed and vengeance are brilliantly shot and is a treat to watch. The CGI developed for the last scene with a vast swelling ocean in the background is breathtaking. The costumes are well designed. But that is it. Baring the effects and the enormous set pieces, the film fails in all other departments. The direction of Ridley Scott lacks depth. Even in Robin Hood (2010), without all the visual effects and CGI, I was able to sit throughout as I felt the story was flowing, which is not the case in this movie. Even though, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton do a commendable job, the storytelling was so weak and clumsy, that you will lose interest. I feel the story has been dragged at many places. There are scenes which slow the story telling process and it is quite boring at times. Then again in the second half, with all the CGI sequences riding over one another, only showcase the poor editing in this movie. At certain times, it is felt that the scenes are just placed one after another without much thought or meaning. The story itself lacked conviction and failed to hold the audience. Even the music is not so enthralling. Now, I don't know exactly the true story about the Hebrews and my judgment is based only on the movie. Even though I like some scenes, my overall experience is not satisfactory. As for me, this is the worst Ridley Scott movie where most of the things doesn't seem right.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Many great talented actors and actresses took the roles of significant characters, but their performances were shallow and they lacked genuine qualities portraying their title roles. The dialogs were meaningless as there were no emotional content visible or otherwise noticeable from the main lead actors, and the supporting roles were just basically flat! The invested efforts in the special effects department did not make up for the lost qualities aforementioned. Director Scott cut down the original movie by 30 minutes, and it was a blessing to bring the film's end much sooner. It stopped one from watching this agonizingly boring production! Despite the fact that I am writing this critique more than a year after the movie's initial release, I wrote my critique to those who may want to watch the film on a DVD rental or on other Media as I did. I hope that they would chose a different biblical epic for their entertainment than this flop! Best Regards, Steve Horvath",Exodus - Gods and Kings
354,KeithNg,No Blockbuster but enjoyable,5,12 December 2014,"In short, this movie felt like a usual TV drama(but with exceptional CGI) with no ups or downs. It had this monotonous feel throughout. Those who yearns for a great climax, don't get your hopes high. Nonetheless, the movie was still able to keep me awake and alert for the full 156mins. The movie followed the original story most of the time and other than a few great moments, it was mediocre.Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on the movie, was just expecting more after seeing the epic line up of actors they have. To start of with the good, the cgi was great, especially when the red sea parting was concerned. The part where the red sea parted and closed back in gave the 'climax' of the movie a great closure. The acting by Christian Bale was pretty good too which made the movie pleasing to watch and follow throughout. Also, the way they portrayed God in the movie was unique. Wont say more about it!Now coming to the parts where I had mixed feelings about. The flow of the story. I expected a brief build up on Moses growing up and his he came to meet God and all. And then the main focus of the story would be on the plagues and trying to free the people. Instead, lots of time was spent on the period before the plagues. Some fighting scenes, scenes of slaves, lots of talking , finding out about prophecy and his true race, getting married. God only appeared after way more than an hour n the show. Then, just when I thought the interesting part, what they had build up for so long, was about to start, the plagues passed by quickly. There wasn't much scenes of the Egyptians begging the pharaoh to release the people or even confrontations between Moses and the Pharaoh like there was in the bible. Perhaps Ridley Scott was trying not to be too predictable and cliché. On a side note, what disappointed me was the little screen time given to most of the actors. When I saw so many big names in the movie, I was puzzled too how they were gonna have a part to play. In the end, many of them such as Aaron Paul and Sigourney Weaver were there just for a couple of lines. Nothing too serious here though.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
355,Quest_Shield,A movie in conflict with itself,5,18 March 2015,"The story of Moses and his conflict with Ramses, Pharaoh of Egypt, as Moses endeavors to resolve his inner turmoil and lead the Jews to the promised land. Turmoil. Conflict. That must have been how Ridley was feeling when his brother committed suicide. I'd say that's what drew him to this project, about 2 brothers who part ways. I'd say he wrote it in big letters on the white board. Turmoil. Conflict. Egypt in conflict with the Hittites. Moses in conflict with Ramses. Moses in turmoil with himself over the seven plagues wrought upon Memphis. Ramses in turmoil with himself over what to do with Moses. Moses is even conflicted about God's revenge, killing innocent children for example. Conflicted emotions abound. And that's the problem with this film, it in turn appears to be in conflict with itself. Is it a fantasy or is it historical? Is it a big epic or a character study? Real or imaginary? Even the casting seems to be in conflict..Aaron Paul as an almost non-speaking Hebrew, Sigourney Weaver as an Egyptian royalty, Ewen Bremner as an Egyptian..expert on things? And of course Australian Joel Edgerton as the Pharaoh Ramses. The film seems to cover the usual ground without much in the way of impetus. It's like it was perfectly story-boarded beforehand, and of course if very well shot, it just seems to connect the dots. I yawned a few times looking at the pretty visuals. Like when I watched the theatrical version of Kingdom of Heaven the first time. The editing didn't do it any favours, it's like it was cut down from a 5 hour version which would fill in the gaps but I don't think I could watch a longer cut of this even if it's better edited. I'm sure Sir Ridley was sure he hit gold with this, probably a new Gladiator but not to be. It just didn't know whether it was religious fantasy, or gritty reality, and fell between the two stools. So my rating is appropriately 5/10.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
356,divinemetamorphoses,Disappointed,5,12 August 2018,"I love Ridley Scott and his vision. A big production that lost elements of the story. Mistaken juxtaposition, bits and pieces felt passionate, as is Mr Scott's usual storytelling. Mismatched, plenty of holes, character development fail. The actors weren't genuine to their roles. Felt all over the place. My reveiw pretty much sums up my discombobulated view, broken. Was it the way it was edited? Love Christian Bale for all of his other roles. Perhaps Moses would have been better cast with someone unknown. Or lesser known. Just a thought.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
357,jonasmarkussen,"IMDb reviewers, we need to talk",7,20 September 2021,"There's a current problem with a lot of the reviews on this site, that continue to annoy me. There's no discussion, that whether or not you like a movie, art is subjective and you can feel about art what you like. But I can't understand why people rate so extremely, giving okish movies a 1 or a 10 to either drag the rating down or bump it up, for the wrong reasons. I find it more often that reviewers tend to the more hateful 1-star reviews to drag a movie down because there was a little thing they didn't like. For me a 10-star movie is an absolute masterpiece and a 1-star movie is unwatchable garbage and should be considered as one of the worst movies ever made. Again, that is a without a doubt a matter of subjectivity, and you have the right to say whatever you like, always! But in my opinion, the problem is when you are giving a movie a hateful review for all the wrong reasons, which, for me, is the case about Exodus.Saying this is a 1-star movie which a lot of reviewers does, in my opinion, is like saying that this is one of the worst movies you've ever seen, which I simply don't believe. It should place right down there with The Room (2003), (which is fun to watch in all it's badness, but still a horrible movie in all aspects), Robot Monster (1953), Disaster Movie (2008) or Cats (2019), to name a few movies that are considered some of the worst of all time, and I agree with that consideration. That, for me, is close to being objectively wrong.So, is Exodus a bonafide masterpiece? No, we can agree on that, and Im not giving this review because it's even close to being my favourite movie, but because I've seen it two times, once in 2015 and again yesterday. This time I read the reviews, and saw a lot of reviewers hating it for reasons I find to be just nonsense. First of all, to all of you who dislike this movie because it's not completely true to the myth and story of ancient Egyptian Ramses and his brother Moses, and the plagues released upon the Egyptians by God to punish them: May I remind you that movies as well as most forms of art and culture depends on creative freedom? Exodus never claims to be an exact replica of the story that have been told so many times before. This is a fictional movie, and not a documentary, which I guess you can find a lot of regarding Moses and ancient Egypt. I don't believe that Ridley Scott didn't knew that, and that he just thought ""I don't know anything about this. But I will just do it like this"". And without commenting on anyones believes and religion, there are scientifically doubts that Moses ever existed (look it up), so who knows how the story really unfolded. But again, whether or not, it doesn't matter, because this is not a movie that's made to be anything close to religious propaganda made for a specific group of religious people, as I saw one said about Exodus. I don't necessarily believe in different types of religious viewpoints being portrayed in different movies, but that doesn't mean I don't like a given movie. I also like Inglourios Basterds (2009) and Argo (2012), to name a few examples that alters or completely diverges from history. Exodus, for me, is an 'historical' and biblical adventure movie, and should be seen as that.Next up is the criticism about acting and CGI. All actors are doing fine, without being absolutely brilliant I'll give the critics that. Bale is not giving his best performance as Moses, but he delivers as always. This man could play Meryl Streep in a biopic, if you ask me. The rest of the cast are doing well too. My biggest point of critic is, as many already wrote, that because the fact that this movie is taking place in Egypt, they should've considered casting people that looked Egyptian or is of Egyptian descent. That would be the right thing to do, but that's a longer debate and again, it's acting and Hollywood is moving in the right direction when it comes to representation. I think it was done respectfully and I didn't thought that much about it, which I normally do. Regarding effects and CGI, I must say that the people giving a low rating based on the 'poor' CGI in this movie, I really want to know what movies you normally see as good in their use of CGI, because they truly most be using an insane photoreal technique I haven't seen yet for a movie that's from 2014 or older. The effects and the cinematography is stunning and Scott really knows how to make a movie look insanely expensive. It's simply beautiful and the best part of the movie, no doubt. It has a big budget, but I actually thought it was a little bit bigger.Exodus is a fine movie, not a masterpiece, and I think most reasonable film loving people can agree on that. Then one might ask why did I write such a long review for a movie being just 'fine'? Well, Im just tired of reviewers using rhetoric leaning towards the hateful that drags a movie down. When people looks to IMDb for reviews before seeing a movie because they want to know whether is good or not it gives a disproportional and wrong picture of the truth, when a fine or even a good movie has received so much hate for reasons that, in my opinion, are close to being plain stupid. I hope IMDb'ers someday will rate and review a bit more fairly so that we all can trust the ratings to a little bit higher degree than at this moment. I bet a lot of people didn't see this when the rating was 5,7 or 6.0 as it is today.Although Exodus is not the masterpiece it wants to be, it's a good adventure movie, with a big scope. It's very pleasant to look at and the acting is just fine. It moves a bit slow sometimes and could have been a little shorter, for my taste, but it's still very suitable for a rainy day on a big screen with a good sound system. EnjoyPlease rate fairly.6.9/10.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
358,flyboy852,I didn't mind this movie at all... as compared to NOAH,6,9 December 2014,"Do the math. 1 part of Sharknado + 1 part of Final Destination + 1 part of Lost + a lot of eye liner and bad British accent (as spoken by 'Egytians') = ?????? That's how Exodus feels like to me.God wasn't there most of the time, he only sent a messenger. And God is one relentless killer. I am sure people will argue God is full of LOVE, blah, blah. Get over it, he kills. I feel that he's such a coward that he never shows his face.If you want to talk, then talk. Why is everything a riddle and a fuss? COMMUNICATION. DUH. And you are GOD? Why play the guessing game? If you want to talk to Moses, talk to Moses. Call him direct or collect. Why make him guess? Don't give me God gives you a choice BS. There's no choice when you are dealing with God, you die if you don't do what he says (or can't figure out what he wants). Tell him what you want him to do! Wouldn't it be a lot easier? That's amazing to me. And I suppose that's the major issue with a lot of people. They simply fail to acknowledge that bible stories are actually quite bloody. When you string a series of bloody events together, it's a horror movie.Another amazing thing is, the cut of the movie seems very abrupt at times. Or maybe they've spent too much money on the visual, but they forgot to make the effects cohesive. The movie portrayed the plague one right after another. To my surprise, the palace was full of frogs, flies and blood in one frame, as soon as another plague starts, the palace was immediately immaculate. Shouldn't there be blood stains or pieces of bodies hanging here and there? It's a plague!! Perhaps they hired some very efficient cleaning crews in ancient times.The part I loved most about this movie was, Moses was quite polite when he wanted to have sex. He always asks his wife before ""proceed"". Can you imagine if somebody's daughter or son is that polite before they get knocked up? ""Hi mom, it's Janice, is it OK if I want to have sex tonight with Jason?"" That part to me didn't show they were in love, it just shows that they want to make the movie 5 minutes longer. That was used twice in the whole movie even, so it's a good 10 minutes to ask for sex.I can't wait to see a full director's cut or uncut, or whatever version they are going to come out with. Oh, probably cut... I mean the Jewish, if you know what I mean.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
359,thethomasfamily-79545,Why was this made?,2,7 July 2020,"The director sure did create an ""epic"" environment. It feels big and looks great but that is where my positives end. When you name your movie ""Exodus"", people have a specific book in mind and that book is not what this movie was based on. I'm pretty convinced that Hollywood has a different ""god"" and a different ""bible"" than the rest of us do. This version of moses was arrogant and murderous. Not the meek and humble (but still human) man working on behalf of God for the Israelites. It is obvious the director, writers and actors have a certain special disdain for God.On the secular hand, the characters lacked all emotion besides loud and arrogant. I'm not sure if loud is an emotion, but this movie thinks it is.This movie isn't worth anyone's time and energy. Read Exodus, it's a lot better.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
360,oystermanproductions,A Fight With God,10,19 April 2015,"Speaking as a Christian, I just want to say this movie rocks. It's amazing. Yes, Ridley Scott took some liberties with Biblical text. The staff of Moses was turned into a sword. But he captured the heart and soul of the story! Moses was a fighter. He fought with God and struggled to follow God's will. He fought with the people he was trying to lead. And he fought with the authorities. We like the staff because it's symbolic of Moses as a shepherd leading his flock. But the reality of it was that this was a very hard struggle, and the sword symbolizes that struggle. And throwing the sword into the sea symbolizes how Moses has stopped fighting with God, and he has surrendered his will. Exodus captures this struggle, this fight, in beautiful fashion.The ultra-realism of the movie reminds me of The Passion of the Christ. But I'm also reminded of The Passion of Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc, like Moses, has been called by God to do something incredibly difficult. Moses has to lead all the Jewish slaves out of Egypt. Joan of Arc has to drive the English out of France. And these artists who are representing these struggles on the big screen are inspired. They want to share these stories with us. I thought the acting was magnificent. The way the actors held it in, like men trying to be tough? I love the minimal dialog. And I felt the pain of Ramses at the loss of his son. I want to thank the financiers, who spent $140 million bringing this story to the big screen. To spend that much money, on a Biblical epic, in this day and age? God bless you. It made me cry, this film. It touched me. I am very appreciative of this beautiful work of art.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Too long, absolutely religion-free and not following even a single line from the Bible.

Since we missed the cinema screening of this, my wife and I opted to watch the DVD of the movie with much anticipation, when it was released. The actors included some big Hollywood names and quite a few international actors to lend realism to the portrayals of the Middle- Eastern characters that the film called for. However, the mediocre script-writing, lackluster acting and the overall insipid production left much to be desired. Despite the modern special effects and CGI technology, this film was intellectually non-stimulating. Woefully, this film could not hold a candle to the 1956 Ten Commandments for dramatic intensity, acting and direction. Even though Cecile B.

It gave me a feeling that I had done something right coming to this movie. From 31st minute till 100th minute, I felt like when is this movie gonna get over. It was too slow, too Vivid.

When I first watched this movie, it had an IMDb rating of 8+ now it came down to 6.8 and when its released out in US, it would go down again. A total let down was Christian Bale.

I was right: it is something of a failure.... It is not that it is not sticking to the Bible says, as some would say and have said here. Finding the roots of what is considered by many as a legend is not so stupid an idea....Everyone who has followed the Israelis new historians, the archeologists' findings, know there is a minima a great part of exaggeration (as there is in the Iliad, as an example. Just visit Jericho and wonder where the walls of the city were..... It is not entirely stupid, either, to try to find an explanation for the crossing of the Red Sea, albeit depicting the lake Menzala, or other explanation, would have been better...... It is simply that, except perhaps the 3D, which in fact does not bring much to the film -the flies sequence reminded me of ""the day the earth stood still"" -, nothing really works...... It is neither faithful to the bible neither to history. The Battle of quadesh is not mentioned anywhere in the Bible, nor does anything in it nor in the Egyptian archives -which are pretty detailed, as well as depicted- is there anything stating that Moses was there (in fact, Moses is not quoted anywhere there). The battle itself started by an hittit attack, and the Egyptians first lost their camping site which was partly looted....Here we are presented with a spectacular all out chariot attack by the Egyptians....... This is perhaps the best part of the movie, however, for afterwards it becomes boring..... Nothing works....Aaron .... is there for what ? he does not, nor does Moses, confront Pharaohs and Pharaohs Magicians....The flaming bush is ridiculous. The idea to present GOD (or is it an angel?) as a young kid does not fit at all , especially if he ""seeks a general"" and let Moses conducts first a ridiculous guerilla (Moses = Che Guevara, may be ???. I am a total atheist (of Marxist lineage, in addition), but if you make an epic involving something as important as GOD for the Hebrews, it has to be palatable and believable. In fact, one does wonder if the authors do not want to suggest that Moses just has visions coming from his psyche, until, of course, the plagues come...... The plagues themselves are ridiculous. One wonders why is there no warning from Moses to the Pharaoh, nor is there the regular recall ""let my people go"", since anyway Moses enters the palace almost by (nightly, it seems ) burglary. To suggest that the blood from the bites from the crocodiles attacking the feluca would be enough to turn all the Nile into red or blood polluted water is utterly laughable.... etc... etc.... one could spend hours about the scenario....... The worst is to come : Moses carves himself the 10 commandments, of which we ignore the contents......... Nowhere is there mention of the gold calf, nor of the column of fire (if you depict miracles instead of making a full atheist peplum movie, depict THEM ALL). The passover plague is ridiculous........ etc... etc.... The worst is that it is almost boring.... I nearly felt asleep The deception was enormous....

368,oceanofblue,Exodus: the story of Moses like you never wanted to see,3,25 December 2014,"I don't know what's up with Hollywood the latest years, but when it comes to historical or biblical movies they really took a downfall to the earth. In the early years you had The Ten Commandments, Cleopatra, Ben Hur and many other movies about the old ages. All of them as close as it could be to the actual settings and with decent monologues and a good told story.Nowadays they take lot's of fails with more recent Pompeii and now Exodus. I applauded Riddley for Gladiator as it was eye candy with a well done story-sauce. But this movie's like a blamage to the story of Moses, almost blasphemic even. The first minutes of the movie showing Ancient Egypt was simply breathtaking and a premise for greater stuff to be shown. But as the first lines came out of the actors mouths, I started to cringe, not sure whether it was a joke or they were serious about it. There was no acting, no depth, just bland dialogs that could easily be muted and still you could follow what was happening. In fact, it would've made the movie far more pleasant to watch. To hear Egyptians with British accents and see them as pale as a brides wedding dress it's one the things I'd reckon to get that straight. However, the pile of cartoonesk Egyptians grew larger and I wasn't sure if I was watching Exodus or a spoof movie on you-tube. The plagues followed one after another, no meaningful dialogs in between, no response from the people, nothing... Just happened in a fast speed like it was something not worthy to be mentioned. The parting of the sea didn't occur like it ended up being a giant tsunami wave crushing pharaoh and Moses, each surviving the impact. And what was it with the tornado's in the background doing nothing. It was clearly meant to make it more epic, however it diminished the moment to an anti-climatic event. There was no pillar of fire stopping the Pharaoh and his army from reaching the Hebrews, instead, they fell from a cliff. And concluding from the shot after they fell, Pharaoh's left with nothing but a few chariots. However, God's probably remorseful because a few moments later it looks like Pharaoh's army's at full force again. About the story itself, I can't tell everything wrong with that, since it would take a whole page, but if you know the biblical story go find out for yourself. But don't be disappointed, you were warned.Eyecandy = a job well done. Story = they should paid me money to hear that one.

Still, I think that Scott could've done better with such story. The implementation just completely falls flat on its face and the characters are awkwardly unwieldy. And, let's face it: Christian Bale just does not look like a Hebrew, and neither does Aaron Paul, in my opinion.After the movie I felt that I had seen something totally pointless; the movie and it's story just make the viewer ask: why was this movie made in the first place?

His role as Moses, portrayed as the general he always was, grant a different view of the classical Moses.Also, there was an attempt to give the ten plagues some sort of logical explanation, but with their root in God Himself, and the great landmark of the Hebrew Exodus, the parting of the Red Sea, was presented in a more, let's say, less divine way. All of this gave the movie a different atmosphere, with Moses and all the events related to the liberation of the Hebrew people a more human touch.It might not be a great movie, but the way the Exodus is presented, and the performance of Christian Bale, make it at least interesting to watch.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
372,miguel-p-fernandes,One word: Average,5,29 December 2015,"An epic should always avoid one adjective: boring.Yet that's how I felt when I watched Exodus: Gods and Kings. Bored. I could not believe this was directed by the same guy as The Martian. What happened, Ridley Scott?There are some good parts to this movie. First and foremost, the long shots that establish the film's setting. They're awesome, they felt very real and natural, and they are what kept me hooked to the movie. For every 5 pieces of bad dialogue, there's a beautiful shot of Egypt and its slums, or one of the hills of the Middle East, and that was, for me, the best part of this movie. Christian Bale delivers. In the first half of the movie, I felt like his character could have been played by anyone, but he shines in the second half of the movie, and he actually made me care for his character. The combat and the CGI were also decent, but they were not employed well: the first wasn't in the movie enough. The first fifteen minutes of the film display a really cool battle scene, but then there's barely any actual battle, which really sucks. The CGI, on the other hand, was overdone. It was beautiful, but I think there was too much of it (especially during the plague scenes).Exodus sins the most in a vital part of any film: its story. It's just not interesting. At all. And because I don't really care about any of the characters except for Bale's (and I only really started to care for his in the second half of the movie), there's very little to keep me engaged. There's no clear narrative direction for the first two acts of the movie, and by the third act, when the narrative starts to get better, I'm already bored and not really caring for anything that's happening. Take Gladiator. I cared about every character, so I was deeply engaged and rooting for the characters. That, together with a great story, acting, and action, made for an epic movie experience. Exodus: Gods and Kings had barely any substance to it, and I felt what I should never feel in a movie experience: boredom. It's, plainly told, an average film.

The movie was excellent.What I enjoyed most were the portrayal of Moses as a mere mortal man that continued to question god, that Moses actually carved the 10 commandments, that Ramses survived the Red Sea and that the plagues were explained scientifically. It is funny that many of the poor reviews said the story was bad but the acting was good. I felt almost the opposite. Christian Bale was a bit weak for the role - Russell Crowe would have been better.Now, how Interstellar received such a high rating and this a poor one is beyond me. The only explanation is that people misread the system and thought that 1 was good and 10 was bad.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

NOBODY It is Christian Bales worst movie without question, and really... I was almost asleep at one point... THAT NEVER HAPPENS, I LOVE MOVIES AT THE THEATER AND I NEVER EVER FALL ASLEEP. This movie is just... there is nothing PG rated to say about this movie. Christian Bale should be ashamed of being in this film, and I am saying this as a huge Bale fan. I am sorry if I am being harsh, but if you see this movie you will regret the 18 dollars you spend on it. Please do not see it.... Go see Heaven is for Real if you are looking for biblical.

375,Decker187,Exodus toward the nearest exit sign...,1,27 September 2016,"...if you're looking for anything halfway entertaining, whether you be Christian, Jew, Atheist, Agnostic, Muslim or anything that breathes. Bento must have been watching a different film entirely. Bale, both as an actor and in his portrayal of the great Hebrew leader, falls flat on both accounts. In fact, he is never portrayed as the leader of his people. Instead he is like a reed tossed about in the wind, never concrete in his faith, continually dissenting with God (ridiculously portrayed as a bratty child for some unknown reason), never directing or channeling God's power to bestow the great plagues upon Egypt, never directly interacting or sympathizing with his people or their plight, etc. Call me superficial, but I was really looking forward to the parting of the Red Sea but that turned out to be nothing more than a low tide excursion as if they were digging for clams. It closed in on the Egyptians, to be sure, but even that was, ahem, watered down. The tornadoes or waterspouts or whatever they were, were simply thrown in for show. None of the characters lept off the screen, some were just simply worse than others.So, since there was no story, plenty of terrible acting, mediocre special effects and an outrageous budget, what are we left with? I'm not quite sure, to be honest. I don't know what this film was trying to accomplish and it seemed to me that neither did Ridley Scott. Try again Hollywood. In the meantime, go and re-watch The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston. It still can't be beat. Speaking of which, the Ten Commandments in this film are literally a footnote, thrown in during the last ten minutes of the film, seemingly meaningless in the overall scheme of things. Weird.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Depicting God as a brat little kid, having the Nile go red in blood because of alligator fight, these are just hiccups of what is wrong in this movie.The only thing that was good in this movie was the effects and the settings. this, it appears, is what the director was focusing the entire movie, neglecting completely about the true magic of the events, the story!I ask my self why, why Hollywood is going down this horrendous road of completely distorting the bible in every chance they get. i wish for a brighter and wiser days for the Hollywood factories.Steer clear of this farce, its only going to disappoint you.Figure out your issues Mr. Scott. till then, please stop making bible epics.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
377,tomburke-62033,Review for Exodus: Gods and Kings,10,1 August 2016,"This movie is a 10 out of 10!!! This is one movie that isn't about keeping the image up of an actor so as he or she looks great all the time through the movie. In fact, it's just the opposite. The reality of everyone having their moments of looking tired and over worked and actual dirty looking from working, from the slaves all the way to the top Ramses's himself. The Mose's character was in my opinion spot on as being human with greed and power and then with coming to grips with settling an inner knowledge that surfaces as his main objective throughout the movie. The movie still left an inner quest for us all throughout the movie as far as the God character is concerned. It is nothing as described in the bible and the contour of this story, compared to the bible version, is more accurate and believable because it has a human story and not a overly dramatic version as told in the 1950's movie version. Of course there are some unbelievable happenings in the movie that makes us all shake our heads in disbelief but that's what a 5000 year old gap between us and them that gives rise to should we or shouldn't we consider to be put in the movie that makes it or breaks it. Some things are better left to the imagination rather than explain through a story line in a movie. Great movie and awesome acting on all levels and production was believable which made this movie a keeper all the way!!",Exodus - Gods and Kings

At least they stayed with the story (with some reasonable poetic/artistic licence). This lugubrious 3-D fest is totally unsuitable for Christian children as it messes with the story and there are numerous laughable historical inaccuracies.

379,jacobburbidge,"A visual treat, yet something is sorely missing",5,24 August 2019,"I was hesitant to watch Exodus, despite my love for Ridley Scott and his style, as I heard many stories about the filmmakers and actors not fully grasping the story of the Book of Exodus. Scott, as an atheist, was a strange director to make a Biblical story. I was pleased with Exodus as an exclusively epic scale film, however it's Biblical aspects are thoroughly lacking.For a start, the story is only slightly partially faithful to the Exodus narrative and there are many, many, many small aspects that are changed. For example, Moses kills two Egyptians in an alleyway instead of one and he does so to protect his identity not to save a beaten Hebrew. Another aspect is the lack of Moses' staff and its use in the crossing of the Red Sea. What is worse is that there are many more essential details that are missing: Moses and Aaron meet far too late into the story, the plagues occur out of order, the burning bush IS God (not the angel). So many things are left out and they seem small to regular audiences but to the Christians watching, it is quite a travesty.The movie is largely centred around its visuals, which is fine for an epic to do, but there has to be an underlying substance to hold all that spectacle up. And sadly Exodus has very little substance. I found it very hard to relate to anyone in the film, even the enslaved Hebrews. It was a struggle to empathise with the characters. I want to say the visuals and production design make up for the lack of characterisation, but I cannot. I love Scott's visual style but it cannot float without good characterisation. But I must say... my goodness is this film a beauty to look at. Both computer-generated and practical, the production is truly great. Expected for a Scott film.The acting overall is fine. No one really stands out to me apart from Joel Edgerton. His broken character is all that makes this movie more than an empty eye-candy fest. Bale is a very strange pick for Moses, but I grew on him as the film progressed. Everyone talks about Bale's casting being strange but I find Ben Mendelson's casting as the viceroy the weirdest thing I have ever seen in an epic film. And I've seen some weird Epics (also can we just point out that Ewen Bremmer, the guy who said in AVP ""now this is like finding Moses' DVD collection"" is featured in an Exodus film? I genuinely think Scott hired him just to make that gag).I wanted this to be so much more, but I guess having a Biblical film directed by an atheist, this is the best kind of result we could have gotten.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
380,widescreenjoe,Excellent Epic retelling of a familiar story,10,3 January 2015,"Ignore the detractors; this is a stupendous and entertaining visual retelling of a familiar story. The film was never intended to be The Ten Commandments all over again, what would be the point of that? Instead it is an original take on the story of Moses filmed on an epic scale with stunning visuals. At 150 minutes, the film just flew by and is well worth seeing in IMAX for the visuals alone. Purists and those annoying politically correct reviewers do not seem to appreciate that Ridley Scott set out to produce an Epic retelling for modern times and keep all the baggage that goes with this genre of movie to the minimum. I found the acting naturalistic and the attention to the detail of life in Ancient Egypt superb. I was so relieved we were spared the site of the baby Moses floating in the Nile but that part of the story was quite adequately covered though. Not a masterpiece but certainly one of the best epics made in recent times. Miss it on a giant IMAX screen at your peril.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

I understand it's hard to accept a different vision or view from the makers but for me it was a great movie with special effects I have not seen much of before. I didn't see this movie for religious reasons, I like the way they made me believe I was looking at old Egypt.

After all, we really don't know a lot of those details.Then came the burning bush, which was really disappointing, and pretty much unforgivable.But the part I just couldn't get past was when Moses returned to free his people. There's no Aaron. The Hebrews train for battle (WTF??), and the plagues are all caused by some crocodiles, and the details quickly glossed over.This is where I had to stop watching, as it is completely unforgivable. First they added completely unnecessary fictional embellishments to invent a story where more details really aren't needed, and then rush over the parts where we actually DO know the details? No way is that acceptable.I gave this a one-star rating because I cannot rate it lower. This film is worth neither your time nor your money.I cannot understand how this managed a 6.1 rating, as even considering it only on its own merits and ignoring the fact that it is supposed to be based on history, it is mediocre at best.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

There's some lovely cinematography in there and I find Bale as watchable as ever. Some of the scenes were breathtaking, others, as other reviewers have said, rely heavily on CGI to the point of being off-putting. My feeling is this all comes down to editing choices. There is a lot of story to cram in to 2 1/2 hours and perhaps a lighter, slower touch would have done this film some good. Moments of thoughtfulness and reflection are absent in this cut, and even though a four hour film would be too much, Peter Jackson has already solved this problem, twice, and I think Exodus could take a leaf from it's book, be a bit more soulful and let the excellent cast do the rest.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Wonderful sets, accomplished actors and great storyline and directing. This one was just sad and dark and ugly. No acting emotion to get your juices flowing. Yeah, it had some cgi and other phony stuff but not enough to convince me to waste any more of my time with it.

This was hyped up to be an epic film and by no means does it even come close to the film Cecil B. de Mille did in 1956. I'm also trying to figure out what Bible they used. You never see Moses real mother or family. It shows Moses having no part at all in the 10 plagues. You don't see him telling Ramses what is to come only that the plagues start happening. You don't see the trials they had to go through to get to Mt Sinai and everything after that.

I would give it 8/10. It doesn't really follow the old story. Moses has showed some personal aspects where a human being would act. The movie has talked about his own family (marriage and child) which is probably my favorite part. When the god approached him, the battle between his own belief and god made him struggle whether he should join his people or continue refusing to recognize himself about who his true identity was. The CG in this movie has demonstrated a great presentation of this epic story. All the punishments are so vivid. What I would the director to spend more time in is the relationship between Moses and his mother and sister. It was a bit too quick for him to accept that he was brought in by his sister. There should be at least 5 mins about how Moses struggled internally yet still wanted to find out his past by talking with his mother and sister before he was forced to admit the relationship. It is weird at first when I saw the actors are all white people and speaking English just like in all other US movies. Anyway, I like this movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Perhaps the most ridiculous and disturbing part of the film was substituting a young child for the Burning Bush, a.k.a. the voice of God, who has a running conversation with Moses which made no sense whatsoever.It is one thing to take a few artistic liberties. In this epic disaster, they added events that never existed anywhere in any retelling of the Exodus story such as a group of Hebrew resistance fighters which Moses trained himself.The acting was awful and the dialogue was even worse. The actor who played Ramses could have mailed in his performance. It was the most underwhelming portrayal of a central character in the story that I had ever seen. At least Christian Bale can act when he has to. However, the only thing that this movie got correct about Moses was the retelling of his birth and how he was placed in a basket and sent downstream on the River Nile to the Pharaoh's Palace, etc..

Ridley Scott and the actors did their best to recreate the despair and triumph told in the bible. The God that Moses (Christain Bale) sees in his visions left much to be desired. For one, if He must have a form, I'd rather God to appear as a man, not a child- it came off a little awkward. Christain Bale was an interesting choice for Moses, but I don't really understand why Moses would have an British accent. I've grown really tired of British accents used in movies, for people who came before Britain or have no connection to Britain. I am almost never disappointed in Christain Bale, even with this flaw, I can appreciate the level of effort he puts into his characters. Good cinematography, graphics and great detailing of the city.

The second thing is that I for one am tired of seeing movies with characters who are supposed to be of Middle Eastern or African descent played by white actors. Scott had gone on record saying that the 'public' isn't interested in movies with casts that are predominantly 'non white'... Well Ridley Scott, I'm not interested in any of your movies now. Ridley, you have been a powerful and influential movie maker and fortunate to be in a position where you can reach people to break the ignorant and selfish 'traditions' that have always overlooked people of color in the main hero roles and you have thrown that opportunity away, deliberately and repeatedly and now, as far as being a director goes, you are irrelevant for me.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

397,michael_sutherland,Is Exodus: Gods And Kings Worthy?,6,16 December 2014,"When established directors make a mediocre film, you tend to give them a certain amount of leeway, because they've earned it. Even Spielberg has lain an egg or two. Ridley Scott is no exception. When looking at some of his bad films, you might balance it out by saying that one of his other films was better. When Prometheus failed to satisfy the fanboys- ""At least Alien was good"". When The Counselor left everyone shaking their heads- ""It would have been better if it was more like Blade Runner"". And when Kingdom of Heaven bored us to death with Orlando Bloom using a bow & arrow for the hundredth time- ""Thank God he made Gladiator"". His most recent films have been more on the side of lacking lately, and his newest one is definitely that. But don't fret. We'll all look to something greater from his past to once again right the wrongs.Exodus: Gods and Kings is another of Scott's films that looks great, but has a black hole at the center of it. And no matter how much sand or eyeliner that you throw into it, it will never be filled. The biggest problem with this movie is that its two and a half hour run time isn't long nor smart enough to contain such a large story. For a film that focuses entirely on Christian Bale's Moses, it's not completely sure what to do with him. Every time that there's a moment that needs to grow between himself and another character, the film shifts to days or even years later. How can we care about the man who ""let his people go"", if we are not shown his development with those people? I'm also still trying accept Bale (who's Welsh) as a Hebrew. He neither looks nor sounds like it. But he's not the worst. Joel Edgerton (Warrior) as Ramesses II, is almost laughable. His spoiled brat of a performance is only surpassed when he has the constant look on his face of ""who dealt it?"". Oh wait, that's because of the large amounts of eyeliner that was applied to him and the other white as hell actors in this (I thought that Tammy Faye Bakker was dead). My other big problem with this movie is the cast. Good to great actors like Aaron Paul (Need for Speed), Ben Mendlesohn (The Place Beyond the Pines), John Turturro (The Big Lebowski), Sigourney Weaver (Paul), and Ben Kingsley (Sexy Beast), are relegated to a mere few scenes, and/or are mostly quiet when shown. With such a powerhouse cast, wouldn't you use them to the best of their abilities?Those major problems aside, the movie looks really good. The location filming is beautiful. The costumes are beautiful. And so is the cinematography. The visuals are impressive on their large scale. The battle scenes aren't bad but, the film's PG-13 rating hurt their effectiveness, and I swear I saw a guy fake like he got stabbed by holding his arm to his side. The overall look of the film really clouds its shortcomings and, some scenes are shot so well that you might temporarily forget about another one the film's many missed opportunities.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, of Exodus: Gods and KingsThe Good- Bring on the plagues! The large scale crocodile attack and the chariot chase through the mountains were very cool.The Bad- I guess the whole ""ten commandments"" and ""wandering the desert for forty years"" thing was only worth devoting about five minutes to. What????????The Ugly- If blackface is so frowned upon in this society (Tropic Thunder excluded), then how in the hell is it socially acceptable for them to makeup people who are pastier than thou into Egyptians?Final Thoughts on Exodus: Gods and KingsExodus: Gods and Kings is a good looking, large scale spectacle that left me emotionally unsatisfied. There was so much more depth into the characters that we should have seen. Scott himself has said that he originally filmed this at four hours long. If that's the case, then waiting for his final cut on Blu Ray may be the best way to go. Either way, it still doesn't make up for all of the honkies in it. If a ""racist"" like Mel Gibson can be more authentic by using appropriate actors (Apocalypto), then why can't Sir Ridley? Rating- 6 out of 10",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The process of deception starts when they fail to distinguish clearly between these two terms: (1) The Egyptians: the residence of the country named Egypt: Egypt, as a country was founded and was built during the six century by the Arabians, and still being built by the Arabians in the modern times. (2) The Faraons (3100 BC – 30 BC); known for some as ""The builders of the Pyramids"": are the residence and the rulers of ""some"" few cities in Egypt.

It's impossible for me to not compare it with ""The Ten Commandments"" since it's exactly the same story, so here goes...""The Ten Commandments"" movie of 1956 at 3 hours and 40 minutes, with No CGI, and No battle scenes is easily 10 times more enjoyable than ""Exodus Gods and Kings.""Every moment of ""The Ten Commandments"" is so captivating with top quality story, scripts, acting, directing, sets, costumes, visual effects, and music that time really flies by when watching it. ""Exodus Gods and Kings,"" however, is so desperately dull, with horrible script, cheap looking sets, lack luster performances, I can honestly say that it's the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. Even the music was forgettable (except when it sounded like the original ""Stargate"" movie soundtrack, which it did a lot of times). And don't even get me started on the visual effects in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" The plagues are done so well they're stomach churning, but they don't even happen in the way that the original Bible stories say they happened. But the ONE scene in the entire movie that's really spectacular CGI is directed so completely without thought that it makes no sense whatsoever...SMALL SPOILER ALERT: The water in the Red Sea is rapidly receding to the right, sort of like what happens before a Tsunami. It only takes a few minutes for that area of the Red Sea to be shallow enough for the thousands of recently freed Hebrews to start walking across. This is disappointing as far as visuals go, but does make sense so far. Then just before the giant wave comes we see absolutely spectacular storm clouds and multiple tornadoes and waterspouts develop. These visual effects are some of the best ever in the history of CGI, but the tornadoes didn't actually do anything at all in this scene. They did not pull the water away in the first place, like the storm clouds created by God (or spaceships) did in ""The Ten Commandments."" They simply appeared in the distance for no reason, just before the huge Tsunami wave crashed down on Pharaoh's soldiers. To show the outright sloppiness of this movie again, in scene after scene there are one or two guys spying on Moses, and nothing ever happens as a result. It's a big set up to a big nothing. LAST BUT NOT LEAST: If you happen to be a fan of the ""Ancient Aliens"" show or believe in Hebrew Mysticism you will be sorely disappointed in ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" Mostly because, the only reason Moses sees a burning bush or talks to God the first time is that he just got conked on the head by a huge rock. Then, every time a miracle happens, this sassy little boy (who is just now angry at the Egyptian Pharaohs after 400 years of Hebrew enslavement) is the one doing the miracles, not even through Moses. Moses really does none of the miracles in this movie. He has a sword through most of it, and never even carries a staff. In the Bible, when Moses came down from Mt. Sinai his face was shining. This is important no matter what your beliefs are. They at least touch on this in ""The Ten Commandments"" but in ""Exodus Gods and Kings,"" the only thing that happens on Mt. Sinai is that the little boy dictates the ten commandments to Moses as he carves them onto the rock tablets. And they don't even show him actually saying any of them. He's just sitting there watching Moses work. Finally, I have to say that it would have been very nice to actually see the Ark of the Covenant in a movie about Moses. Moses is shown riding with presumably the Ark in a basket on a veiled wagon, but still the only time in the history of the movies that we get to see the actual Ark is in an Indiana Jones movie, which is also easily 10 times better than ""Exodus Gods and Kings.""So if you feel like seeing a Biblical movie or a movie about ancient Egypt, definitely buy or rent ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). Also, ""The Robe"" (1953) is not a Bible story, but is the best portrayal of true Christian principles of faith and unconditional love that I have ever seen. Both have amazing, high quality stereo and surround sound for their time. Their original soundtrack albums are two of the all time best in the history of Hollywood also.In fact, as inaccurate as it may be, I even found the 2008 adventure ""10,000 BC"" hugely more enjoyable than ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" Likewise the 1994 sci-fi film ""Stargate.""",Exodus - Gods and Kings
401,Tayrick,Don't waste an evening watching this.,1,22 January 2016,"I needn't go into much detail of why I feel this film is so awful, as other reviewers have covered it all. Previous film versions of the Exodus story (such as Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Ten Commandments') have been so much better, so why this dreadful remake was even considered is beyond me. It is Hollywood at its worst — at times ridiculously over-dramatised, at others just plain boring, and a severe distortion of the biblical account. In the scene about the burning bush, for instance, instead of Moses kneeling awestruck at the incredible sight as the majestic voice of God calls out from the bush, he is depicted as lying submerged in mud (on Mount Sinai?) while God appears as a young boy. The pathetic way the plagues are portrayed is ridiculous, and the details of the Passover are so minimal that I must have dozed off for half a minute and missed it. It was 2 hours 24 minutes of my life wasted.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
402,andredvalera,"it's not a perfect movie, but it's good entertainment",7,23 January 2020,"I really don't understand why people dislike so much this film. Although we know its flaws - like the plot being very similar to Gladiator or Bale's not so convincing acting -, it is always a film that I watch when is on TV. The production is great and the film pace keeps you enterntained for the whole movie. Bottom line: don't just go watch the film based on the very bad or very good reviews (in fact, be aware of film reviews that says the films are ""horrible"" or ""wonderful"") - it is not the best film directed by Ridley Scott, but for sure it deserved a better score in IMDB.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

404,Tyler_Durden-BG,"Great Visuals, Pointless Movie",6,3 December 2014,"This is my first review but I wanted to write it because there aren't other reviews. So...this is a Ridley Scott movie and my expectations were very big as for all of Ridleys movies, but I was very disappointed. I'm a huge fan of Gladiator and other movies that he has made. The truth is that the movie looks amazing - beautiful landscapes, great effects, very good use of 3d, good music and sound effects but it don't adds anything new to the story. We all know the story and if you make a movie from it, you should add something new that you want to say. Also I think that it would have been great if Scott add something crazy in the movie as I don't care how the things are in the Bible. Usually I don't pay big attention to the character development in the movies, but Exodust has none. Moses is completely underdeveloped and has no clear motives for his actions. So as a Ridleys movie it's bad, as a movie about this story, it's very good.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
405,doubleshoot,Hmm....Not really,3,4 April 2015,"I know, now we just wait for him to get back to Egypt and set things in action, meet Aaron and negotiate with Pharaoh regarding the release of his people. But you will be shocked that this Moses is neither the one who stammers with tongue nor with his sword. He secretly ambushes Pharaoh in his palace and threatens him in the name of God.For whatever reasons, Moses here trains an army of handful of Israelite men the basics of archery, for what? to take down the entire Egyptian army? I doubt that! To deal with this adamant Moses, God says I will do my business, you can stop fighting, only to dampen the Moses's mighty spirit to save his own people. I can't believe they showed the plagues to have had fueled from the river full of crazy crocodiles eating 10 men!! Whatever the director thought of the original story of Aaron using his staff on the river to change it into blood, he came up with this idiotic picture in his head. And all the other plagues are the effect of this blood plague! Clearly there was no effort made while narrating this story to convey that Hebrew people are not being affected by the plagues. On top of it, Moses is telling God to fall in line with the story by saying that everyone is getting affected by these bloody plagues can you like stop? Thanks to the disobedient Moses, it helped the director not convey God's repeated messages to Pharaoh, warning him to leave Israelites from his country. Good God! Somehow, Moses cryptically warns Pharaoh that his son might die that night if he wouldn't let his people out of country by night. I couldn't stop wondering if it not for the actual Pharaoh, this Pharaoh would have listened if Moses just spoke the words as absolute God's word.By now, we should know what to expect from this Moses, but I was totally unmoved by his concern for lambs over the preparation for Passover. We see that the movie might end soon when Hebrew people start to leave Egypt with anticipation about the great Red sea scene. Another disappointment greets us there as well, no amount of joy is shown on the faces of people who have been slaves for 400 years once they got freedom, I am sure the director very well knows how America celebrates 4th of July! I think I need to let go of some more failures of Moses here and just come to the end, yeah there is no parting of the red sea! You will be aghast to discover the reason for water to recede, Moses flinging his sword into the water! Moses has absolutely no clue where he is going, no God to talk to him. Pharaoh hasn't lost the lead, follows him soon. Given the confused emotions of Moses about his love for his Pharaoh Brother putting him in turmoil, fighting his own personal battles he waits and waits to be drowned in the flood. Oh no, they didn't kill him and our hero comes out of the sea to the side where Hebrews are waiting. Now, who led who exactly! Sigh!!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
406,parker22002,Hollywood just doesn't get it,1,21 September 2015,"I went into this movie having expectations that they would take some dramatic license, after all that is what Hollywood does with anything that they adapt that has an original idea. I knew it could not be worse than Noah, and I was right, but it is not much better. The movie started out OK, even if it did not follow exactly with the bible, but then it just went south as soon as Moses went to talk to God for the first time. They got right with the burning bush, but why on God's green earth did they have to project him as some kid? And then Moses is seen arguing with ""God"" and acting like he is some sort of task master that is asking him do things that are unreasonable. The kicker is at end for the parting of the Red Sea. Moses does not even do anything, he just sits on the beach like he has no clue in the world, takes a nap, and then suddenly the water is receding. Then when Pharaoh's army follows after and the water comes back and is supposed to kill all of his army, most of them retreat and are safe, and Moses rides back to try and save pharaoh and gets caught in the same deluge of water and miraculously survives himself along with the pharaoh. I guess it is safe to say that when it comes to the Bible, Hollywood should just keep it's grubby finger off of it. No good can come from it",Exodus - Gods and Kings
407,arthurmansolf,Another perspective of Moses - Exodus: Gods and Kings,6,4 March 2017,"This is biblical story made into a movie. I like it because it seems to be well made. Whether the story is correct I don't know. If producers and directors want to make movies about the bible or Hebrew Torah then why don't they just follow those words written so long ago. From what I remember from the bible this touches on some of the story but strays a lot trying to fill in the feelings of those characters involved. This movie looks good, has a good cast and has a great director and technical staff, but it just doesn't feel like a biblical story. Seems more like the movies made about the Roman Empire or stories set in the B.C. of history. I believe the last movie I saw about Moses was with Charlton Heston as Moses and he seemed to fit the role while Christian Bale does not. Bale did a good job, he just doesn't make me see him as that bible character or any biblical Character. I have to admit that Christian Bale though a good actor did not seem right for Bruce Wayne and his Batman half is covered with the costume so that part was okay. So movie kind of good and follow the bibles for future projects. Why do they keep making bible movies?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
408,salieri_21,Ridley. You are no Mel Gibson!,3,8 December 2014,"What a waste of my time and money this movie was. Just feels wrong from start to finish. A fake epic devoid of any real emotions and soul.Wish Mr. Scott has the courage someone like Mel Gibson had when he made this movie. Passion Of The Christ & Apocalypto are prime examples of a director willing to risk everything for what he believes in(even if you disagree with it). And after watching this film. I can safely say Ridley only believes in money.Moses & Ramesses should've been played by middle eastern actors. Christian Bale should've played Moses' brother Aaron(according to old scriptures, he did most of the talking for Moses). While John Turturro & Sigourney Weaver casting was just plain wrong!The story has been told so many times and it would've been much better if Ridley told the story of the Hebrews after leaving Egypt. Their 40- year Sinai plight for example. Started the film with the plagues & the Red Sea parting, then took off from there to show us events not many know of.Don't waste your money on this. Wait for the director's cut then rent it. Maybe Mr. Scott can save this from the $4.99 shelf.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

All you had to do was stick to the script! But something went terribly wrong, and if i have to guess it was the 4 writers Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine and Steven Zaillian. I mean feel free to change the Exodus Story a bit, if you can make it better, but those 4 writers, maybe thought, why make it better, if we can make it less interesting, and less epic and less cool.I Just feel sorry for Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton, who worked really hard on this movie, it just seams they were the only one! a 150 minutes movie, that should have been 100 minutes long! By the way, great idea with God being a Kid, just you picked the wrong kid!

410,yesterdayman2002,Ridley Scott's best since Gladiator,8,12 December 2014,"I am a bible-believing Christian who was able to walk into this film with my head pulled out of my bum and give this a chance as a movie in its own right and not demand it be 100% faithful to the source material.I saw this at a promo screening and sat in the front section which i like to do for movies that are a visual spectacle.I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end, somewhat off-put by the voice of God being represented as a small child but later realized it was an artistic choice that worked better with the atmosphere of the film than a loud booming voice speaking to Moses would have.What this film had that DeMille's interpretation lacked was atmosphere, the kind of atmosphere that only the director of Blade Runner could do. I felt soaked in the world of ancient Egypt (whether it was accurate or not i did not care, it still felt like a believable world and from a movie standpoint that's all that should matter)Christian Bale was absolutely lovable and you people crying race can go get bit, no one else would have nailed the character as he did. (BTW I'm reading the tales from the Arabian nights and even the medieval Arabs knew and declared the hebrews were white, so I believe nothing here is whitewashed, but i also believe it is not what this movie should be judged on regardless).My favorite scenes (that made the film worth going) were the opening battle scene, the plague scenes, and the mountain collapse scene (you'll know it when you see it).As for the non-effect driven scenes, i enjoyed the final scene with Moses and God, the final scenes with Moses and his wife, and that shocking scene when the Egyptian people raided the Pharoahs granary reserve.A job well-done Ridley Scott, this is one person (among many with me in the theater) who was thoroughly entertained by your work.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
411,amdhamm,A Stunning Fall,5,17 March 2015,"I usually enjoy Ridley Scott movies. Not so much this movie. I gave this one 5 stars for good cast, costumes and scenery. Special Effects were decent but nondescript. When all is combined, this movie falls flat. For a movie of this length, one should not be left with a feeling of emptiness when the credits began to roll. Holes in the story, insufficient emotion and lack of impact. Perhaps if this movie were shorter and better edited, it would have improved. It appears that some still fail to understand people often go looking for the spectacular in familiar places. When you don't find it, you are left deeply wanting. Even though we all know the Tin Man gets a heart, the Scarecrow a brain, and the Lion his courage, we still get excited every time we follow the yellow brick road.

I still fell asleep around the time of the start of the plagues. I would have had a very restful sleep had it not been for the massive sub-woofer effects surrounding the subsequent scenes. I have never ever fallen asleep before in a theater.I will say this. If you are looking for a story line somehow depicting events as recorded in the Bible, then be prepared for an alternate universe.Really, the admission price is not worth watching this movie. Go rent ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (consistently and annually voted the the worst movie ever). It's money better spent.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
413,MilezDas,A movie where the story should have been nurtured carefully...,5,26 July 2015,"When I hear the name Ridley Scott, I have a image of Blade Runner in my mind with the atmosphere of Alien and the epicness of Gladiator.But for the last few years Ridley Scott has lost his way in the imagery of movies. His recent movies are a visual treat but when we think of the content he is presenting it isn't what he was showing 10 years back.Exodus Gods and Kings is a story about Humans and God. How the human considered themselves god and above all. And how one God tends to show his power with the help of Moses who I thought through this movie was just an messenger free the people who have been slaves for more than 400 years.This movie is visually stunning with great effects and the feel of Egypt but when we look for a depth in the story it drifts apart. I don't know why but it was an empty effort as there are four writer for this movie. And I think this story has so many layers originally and I think the writers just pealed it out as fast as they can.Christian Bale and Joel Edgarton were amazing in their roles.This movie could have been great only it would have been nurtured carefully.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
414,archaon_91,"Comparable to Prometheus, but i expected worse from it!",7,12 April 2015,"I truly love Ridley Scott movies, but since Prometheus it's been going slightly downhill for him... maybe it's his age, maybe he's just losing his touch, i don't know.All i know is that it doesn't match the shock and awe that Gladiator had for me. However, it's not the terrible movie like some here make you believe. The movie jumps in halfway the life of Mozes and doesn't really tell the background story from the beginning, so it already jumps into action with a big battle early on in the movie, which sets a high pacing for the movie. But unlike other movies of Ridley Scott where you build up to a climax in the end, the movie does it the other way around, it actually slows down in pacing the further the movie progresses. And THIS is the main problem i have with this movie: it begins great and the plagues halfway the movie are done nicely, but after that it feels like you've been through the best part of the movie and the last hour of the movie is dragged on and on for no reason. Other than that i think Christian Bale did an OK job with the acting and the story/script was done fine, just like the visual effects and the cinematic photography of the sets they filmed in (as you would expect from Ridley). But i think that for the average film viewer this movie won't leave a big impression behind.I do admire and respect the movie for being truthful to the biblical story and trying to tell a proper story. But for some reason i feel like it's been stretched out too long.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
415,john-roberts-326-143561,Too many holes,3,29 March 2017,"There are so many holes in this story that surely others can blast it forever, but the best ones are: Moses not only uses his golden sword to be thrown in an Excaliber like style into the Red Sea as his last resort to find a solution..and voila... a tsunami starts to happen....and just after his followers don't believe him and once again debate if it is a good idea to follow this mad man, since he never refers to them as his tribe or people that really believe in him as a leader or profit. Yet the best part is, after getting pummeled by a massive 150 foot tsunami wave...he miraculously survives and nobody comes up to congratulate him in his distressed, bloodied ripped open body condition - but instead...he brushes it off like no big deal..just another day surfing some killer waves dudes, and Ramses also survives with his 50 pound golden necklace still attached. And to make matters even more funny... he tells his brother .. oh by the way.. i have a wife and a kid.. you think its cool they come along for our 40 year trek across the middle east to the promised land? His brother replies. You're married? It is so funny.. making one realize that they have not talked at all or had any connection during the super long walk aka Exodus from Egypt to the Red Sea.. they never once talked about anything and are total strangers. Ridley and his writers surely smoked some good weed to write this garbage that is just so pathetic you truly wonder what made them make this script get approved.. unless maybe.. just maybe there is 2 hours missing on the cutting floor.Too many spoilers to mention besides the total lack of dialogue of any meaning for any of the poor foolish actors that signed up for this hogwash film.. which is even more ruined by a wide array of British blue eyed actors...who make more of a farce of being Egyptians. Not sure where Ridley got the memo that Egyptians have blue eyes yet and all happen to also have British accents.. i mean at least try to hire someone that looks slightly Egyptian... and Paul Aaron with a smeared on self tanner looks so laughable that it is hard to take him serious as Ramses senior adviser. At least John Turturo looked the part but acted like an effeminate moron throughout the film but had more lines than almost any other character.. and poor Joel Edgerton was given no meaningful lines and just looked pathetic..sitting next to his son.. with no servants, maids, or concubines.. and given.. Ramses had over 100 kids.. but no.. he is a dad sitting alone at night watching over his son..truly hysterical, and i will not go into how lame Ridley and his writers make the Egyptian society and their beliefs seem like ignorant fools. And he dares to use some scientific explanation of the plagues as if Ramses advisors at that time had any clue of scientific deductive reasoning for a society that worshiped every animal and astrological symbol and the after life.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The actors is also great. Christian Bale is perfect for this role. This movie is the best Ridley Scott ever directed.I give it a 10/10.

It starts of well, knotting your expectations higher, ultimately falling into a boring, clichéd drama. It could have been a watchable movie if the screenplay had been better but all you see is people mindlessly walking for 30 minutes being followed in the last few minutes. Direction itself is poor so howsoever Moses has gulped down the character it goes in vain. It's a boring saga of two brothers turning into rivals.

421,no_imagination4815162342,Gladiator Episode I: The Pharoanic Menace,7,26 December 2014,"If I were judging this movie on historical accuracy, it would probably get 0/10. However, my enjoyment of it increased when I realised that so, indeed, would Gladiator and that is a brilliant movie. I therefore checked my inner pedant at the door and approached this film the same way as Gladiator - a fictional story set in the ancient world in which some characters have a historical basis. With this approach, all the controversy and fuss melts away and you are left with an enjoyable well-made epic that entertains even if it never quite reaches the epic heights of Gladiator.The main strengths of the movie rested with three people: Ridley Scott, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton; and ten plagues. I have always been a big fan of Ridley Scott's style. I have seen many interviews where he says he enjoys ""creating worlds"" and those skills are on full display again here with Ancient Egypt. Everything looks sumptuously epic from the battles to the palaces, the costumes and sets. (I am sure there are many people who deserve a lot of credit for these things but I don't want to start listing them like an Oscar acceptance speech.) I always believe in Ridley Scott's worlds whether or not they are historically accurate and once immersed in the world, I am ready for the story to unfold.The other main strengths of the film are the two central performances from Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as Pharoah Ramses. Bale is reliably good as usual but I am prepared to give slightly more praise to Edgerton for making Pharoah an interesting and sympathetic character - to the extent that I think it would be unfair to call him a villain. The best scenes of the film are those between Ramses and Moses and I fully believed in their relationship.The plagues were excellently executed!Now for the problems. This is no Gladiator. Not even close. Unfortunately, some of the plot points and themes of these two films are so similar (especially at the beginning), it is hard not to be mentally comparing the two while watching Exodus and Exodus comes up desperately short in comparison. One problem is that, aside from Ramses and Moses, the other characters made very little impression on me at all. The truth is, no one else was given much to do. Periodically, quite famous people would turn up and explain some of the plot but they weren't really given any character of their own.An even bigger problem is a somewhat sluggish second act. There is a section which I felt could have been shortened or cut entirely. In the interest of keeping this spoiler free, I won't say which one but if you find yourself wriggling around in your seat, looking at your watch and wondering when the plagues are coming then you have found it. This is a long film and I won't deny that I felt the length at times. Fortunately the first and third acts are action-packed enough that this can almost be forgiven.Overall, an enjoyable but imperfect film and well worth seeing on a big screen at the cinema.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

It seems they wanted to show Moses (Christian Bale) was a real person...falling in love, getting married, having a family and even tried to show he didn't much believe in God.They had God being portrayed by a little boy with an attitude...very strange. Moses and the little boy (God) didn't agree on much...maybe about as much as this movie wanted to agree with the Bible.This is a biblical movie with a Hollywood spin, made for income - not to bring people closer to God or to believe in God.

Well the movie starts at a decent pace, builds drama and excitement to a certain level. Unfortunately it starts to loose its plot gradually, becomes monotonous with flimsy and poor dialog. Though the movie has some visually stunning scenes shot in ancient Egypt, it fails to combine these with a solid and compelling story. The actors did a pretty decent job but the real highlight of this movie was Christian Bale's acting.

I believe that all Christians should boycott these so-called biblical movies that are produced by secular producers because they don't know what they are doing. 4. They make themselves look foolish because anyone that knows the story of Exodus can see through this. 5. The movie was written from a secular humanism standpoint to deceive those that haven't read the Bible. 6. It lacked quite a bit - everything was wrong - even the color didn't look realistic. 7. All the plagues of Egypt were cleverly explained away from a secular standpoint to make the movie appear as of the Exodus never occurred. 8. Characters were too obvious and too contemporary. 9. Very pale-skinned actors portrayed scenes, which occurred in very hot sunny climates. 10. No more spending my time and money to see any biblical movies produced by secular producers who could care less as to how they portray the sacred text of the Holy Scriptures. 11.

427,ericjakobs-1,Technically solid and entertaining but not for biblical purist,7,31 December 2014,"I felt compelled to review this movie looking at the huge number of people who gave this movie a 4 or less. I rated it a seven though a 7.4 would be closer to the final mark. Technically the movie is astounding with very realistic backdrops. It seems to me that this is the way Egypt, or at least parts of it, must have looked like at the time. I have visited many of Egypt's monuments and at least these appear to be well represented. The cinematography is remarkable and the 3D works well for the first 20 minutes (the effect always wears off for me after that) The acting of the leads was very effective. Christian Bale was as intense as ever portraying Moses and his reluctance to lead as well as his inner struggle became apparent. Joel Egerton gave a very nuanced performance as Ramses. All other roles are rather small and some of the talent could be regarded as wasted but why view it like that? Ben Kingsley, Sigourney Weaver and Aaron Paul do more than just make mere cameo appearance so things could have been far worse. This story does not allow much time for developing all the characters and in my opinion it does not need to. So the story-line is not one on one with the one in the old testament. That hardly means it is offensive and certainly not that its less history accurate.-Spoiler Alert- What is interesting is the way one of the Pharaohs consultants explains the plagues. This may not be to the liking of all Christians. Perhaps some of them would have preferred that Dinosaurs would have been included to help create the grand monuments. Talk about historically accurate ;-). This is clearly not a tale of submission to religion. It is more a tale of doubt and it may perhaps inspire people to take a fresh look at ancient writings and question the occurrences in much the same way Moses is doing in this movie. All in all the movie is entertaining. It may not be Scott's best but than again he has an awful lot to live up to.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
428,bohar06-1,A MOVIE! and a rarity-a thought provoking movie,9,28 December 2014,"Like the title says this is a thought provoking movie,if your looking for a film watch the excellent 12 Angry Men or Tom Hardy's latest ""The Drop""I'll break this down into Pacing Story Acting and Direction,the CGI without the need for saying was top notchPacing:was quite good,there were few points where I felt like if I had the choice,I would fast forward through,the opening battle was perhaps a bit rushed as well as parts of the ending,overall the runtime feels acceptableStory:The most difficult part,I genuinely believe that Scott considered two things regarding the story FIRST:everyone knows how it ends,so tension can be hard to build here when,haha spoilers cannot be providedSECOND:We live in secular times,so no matter how hard he tried,it would be nigh on impossible to make the audience feel about Moses and Ramses the way they should or used to.ACTING:For me the art of acting is being able to move from character to character and BE the current character.In this regard Bale,kind of fails,it depends.He had one of THE hardest roles to play,considering the actual history of Moses(not a great public speaker and so on) he did an okay job,but there was some Bruce Wayne-esque mannerisms especially with his family.That said his scenes with Edgerton were quite well done,understated. Edgerton had a very meaty role in Ramses,one of Histories great villains,and for me he just about pulled it off,make-up or no he didn't go OTT which would have been extremely easy.Watch ""Warrior"" and you'll understand my point of moving from character to character. On a side note the 12 year kid playing God?Steals EVERY scene he is in,great performance with little time.Kudos. Also John Turturro ?Better than the booming Heston version Weaver was a bit wasted,although not a central character,so forgivableDIRECTION: this section will be incomplete until the 4 hour version comes out,but seriously this is the best director of our time the Hans Zimmer of directing.I do believe he had to get a Caucasian cast to get funding for the film and appeal to Western audiences thats just pragmatism,sometimes,there is a whiff of The Life Of Brian,but his hands were tied in that respect.I especially liked how he tried to apply logic to the plagues through Bremner(come on every film needs a bit of humour,Scottish accent in Egypt or no) without trampling on peoples beliefs.It is interesting also to note how logic cant be applied to the First Born child bit,versus using Natural occurrences for the Parting of the Sea bit.All in all I enjoyed this movie,I think eventually it will be remembered for the right reasons,PEACE TO ALL HINDU'S,BUDDHISTS,MUSLIMS,CHRISTIANS,HEBREWS AND ATHEISTS <--not in order btw,hopefully no matter what sect you belong to,we can all enjoy a decent flick now and again",Exodus - Gods and Kings
429,mjmspano,totally confused--I loved it,7,19 December 2014,"SoI almost didn't go all the bad reviews all the anti-Biblical, anti-'DeMille' criticisms. I really liked it. It covered a part of the Exodus story in a well thought-out and believable way. It addressed a part of the story that we all wonder about-- like how does a man raised in the Egyptian court of the Pharaoh, as the son of the daughter of the Pharaoh, come to lead the Hebrews out of Egypt. What talents does he require? How does he acquire a faith he was not raised with? This would be the same man that leads them for 40 years in a desert peopled with other tribes they would have to defend themselves from.As far as the idea that G-d wasn't present in this film-- that is patently ridiculous. While the idea of G-d as a small child at first seemed strange, it is not that strange considering we are currently in the Christmas season. I enjoyed how G-d challenges Moses, and Moses speaks to G-d. It is reminiscent of Abraham arguing for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. I found it especially touching at the end when Moses sees G-d walking among His people.As far as the 'it's not DeMille' criticism-- it is a beautifully filmed movie. The large shots of Egypt and the Sinai area were breathtakingly done. I saw it in 3-D (which always gives me a headache) but it was worth it. The action scenes were just what you would expect from Ridley Scott and it didn't remind me of Gladiator at all (which was a change from some of his other scenes.On a side-note, the music was lovely as well.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Sure it could have been better, and of course it has some big historical mistakes and miss-confused some religions thoughts, but come on! it's an action, adventure and drama 150 minutes movie.. So grow up and ignore the newbie IMDb negative comments, I give it 7.5/10 .. and may be 8 for Christian Bale & Ridley Scott. I will keep it on my DVDs lists.

Oh dear oh dear... special effects do not a movie make. Despite obviously an epic budget this was an epic yawn... I hate not watching a movie to the end so persevered but wish in hindsight that I hadn't. Sorry to all those who made this but it really is very dull and boring... I didn't feel any attachment to the characters, Aaron Paul was totally wasted whilst Bale and Edgerton are capable of so much better. I suspect the lure of being in a Ridley Scott movie perhaps enticed them? Anyway... I don't normally bother to write reviews but felt a sense of duty to try and warn others not to endure this film.

A great movie draws the viewer in and compels him to viscerally participate in the unfolding drama on the screen.This film does neither.In fact, it appears to have been framed by the writers/directors to intentionally and repeatedly remind the viewers that they were sitting in a theater, watching a sophomoric parody of well-known story, with grotesque caricatures of well-known historical figures.Rather than watch this thinly veiled attempt to deny the divine, you would be better off watching or re-watching the ""Great Movie"" and epic production directed by Cecil B.

I simply went to ""go and see"". The first part (up to the moment when Moses returns to deliver his people from Egypt) was too long, quite annoying to my taste. The second part was a great mash-up of effects and epic sceneries but none of that can make up for the fact that all the characters felt somewhat estranged to the viewer. None of the the actors made me feel compassion nor excitement. In conclusion, all I could think of was: thank god, we have The Prince of Egypt. Despite being animated and perhaps having simplified the biblical story, this interpretation of Moses' story managed to deliver a wave of emotions and deep impressions. Unlike Exodus.

434,silahsor,thou shalt not watch!,4,24 March 2015,"""Exodus"" is like a bag of mixed nuts, just as Ridley Scott's career. Not great, not bad. He always favored big-budget, big-cast movie-making; prioritizing visuals and ambiance over narrative and characterization. His films always do look good, but they don't have much depth at all. So, transforming the Hebrew mythos into $140 million cinema spectacle seems just right up his alley. But once again, no surprises! The result: just another glossy and stylized junk; heavy on style, light on substance.Cinematically, the movie does rely too much on the CGI crutch. But, I must say that visuals are feast to the eyes, going far beyond Scott's previous epics ""Gladiator"" & ""Kingdom of Heaven"" in detail, depth and scale. Ancient Egypt and grandeur of its architecture are recreated beautifully. Panoramic vista of Memphis is spell-binding; indoor/oudoor set pieces are meticulously made. Outfits of all kind are top-notch too. Moody lighting and color grading give the picture a fine-art painting feel. But, visually what I most like is the unleashing of the ""Ten Plagues"" –especially sequences of giant crocodiles turning the Nile red with blood, swarm of locusts, and plague of hail which pelted the Pharoh's palace–, all rendered in gorgeous digital details.But, in 21st century CGI-laden movie-making terms, these are not a big deal! Visuals grabbed my interest for only the first 30 minutes. That's all. From now –another crutch, a much more sturdy one– is needed to too keep the movie fresh, engaging and gripping. But, unfortunately the rest of the movie fails to deliver a memorable retelling of the story of Moses, and in the end, it turns into a messy, stereotypical action flick filled with equally stereotypical character archetypes, and overly distorted plot devices.The most overwhelming eccentricity is that Moses is portrayed as a sword-wielding warrior, rather than a staff-carrying prophet. He was depicted as a cutthroat liberator rather than a divinely-inspired leader. At first, he was busy with slaughtering the Hittite army like ""Leonidas"". Then he turned into an insipid mixture of Braveheart & Maximus who waged an armed insurgency and fought a guerilla war with Pharoh's forces, and finally he turns into Spartacus as the years and the hardships pass! Even worse, Christian Bale is a total miscast with his British accent, disappointingly lacklustre performance, zero chemistry with the others on screen; he shows absolutely no believability, credibility and depth as a prophet.Not finished yet! The choice of ""whitewashed"" cast is another big oddity. All lead roles; Royal Egyptians, Moses, and petulant 10- year-old God's messenger (Malak) are comprised almost exclusively of white people, while slaves/thieves/servants are all from non-whites. Hold your laughter: John Turturro plays Pharaoh, Sigourney Weaver plays Egyptian queen! Turturro looks far more ridiculous as Pharaoh Seti than his memorable role as Jesus Quintana in Big Lebowski.. All these peculiar choices and the racially discriminatory approach prevalent in the movie is nothing but insulting the viewer's intelligence.Lots of deviations from the Biblical narratives too. No ""baby Moses in a basket in the Nile"", no ""staff-to-snake"" scene, no ""God speaking from within the burning bush"", no ""parting of the Red Sea with the staff"".. More amazing is that the movie implies ""Ten Plagues"" are results of natural phenomena, rather than a Divine interference in the form of miracles and/or mysteries. The very first plague –water into blood– is caused by crocodiles ferociously attacking to the fishermen and feasting on each other. The river running with blood triggers an ecosystem impairment, and other plagues (swarm of frogs, lices, locusts and flies, outbreaks of boils and murrain) follow. Even, the parting of the Red Sea is not a divine splitting of the waters depicted in Biblical accounts per se, but it is due to a quick drainage of sea bed. The following hurricane that brings water in from afar, and drowns all Egypiant charioteers is a result of a tsunami wave spawned by a meteor strike that Moses saw a night ago. Thankfully, the only hint that Scott gives us that the deaths of the Egyptian first-borns is ""God's doing"" –a favor for the Hebrews– when Moses tells Ramesses that none of the Hebrew children died that night. By demythologizing the sacred texts, Scott –a self-proclaimed agnostic– makes a controversial choice, and it seems he tries to make a murky balance between the demands of devout viewers and tastes of typical Western/American moviegoers. May all these help his box office prospects in the same way ""whitewashing"" does? Maybe, but I am not sure..Apart from unfaithfulness with the Judeo-Christian texts, another problem is that the movie focuses mostly on a cutthroat rivalry between Moses and Ramesses, and it doesn't invite anything in the way of his spiritual struggles and emotional challenges. No any single scene about the transitions he went through as a prophet during his life. This makes ""Exodus"" a superhero-vs-villain sort of fully Hollywoodized, action-filled flick using every possible kind of trite clichés from beginning to end. Let's take the battle scene with the Hittites, during which Moses saves Ramesses' life. Zillion of times we saw such ""cheap"" formulae to elevate the director's superhero(es). Remember ""300"" where fearless, valiant and admirable Greeks, led by invulnerable Leonidas, are pitted against freakish, tricksy and evil Persians. In ""Exodus"", the same applies: Glorious, courageous and invincible Egyptians, led by invulnerable Moses, are pitted against sleazy, ugly and clumsy Hittites. Furthermore, it's quite interesting to see that Scott and his screenwriters dare to degrade the Hittite army to a horde of tribal riffraff, in fact who were the greatest and mightiest military force of its time.To sum up, ""Exodus"" is a 'trademark' Ridley Scott movie; fully employing all cinematic tools at its disposal, but lousy treatment of wonderful source material in general. Suffering from a sense of superfluousness from beginning to end, and overly obsessed with boosting box office takings, what's missing in ""Exodus"" is a sense of sincerity and genuineness.

Typical of Hollywood to create a time period film a with a cast of Europeans pretending to be the first generation of humans on earth despite that fact that science and scholars have proved otherwise. Now many of you will argue that race and color doesn't matter, when clearly, nature disagrees and obviously appreciates creating living things in a variety of colors. It is utterly shameful in this day and age for producers and directors to exclude historical facts or assimilate cultures. Then when asked why the main characters were played by a cast of white people, the producers claimed that if they had cast Africans or 'black' people for those roles, they would have lost funding.

436,noviembrex,Not for Bible fanatics,8,11 January 2015,"Im sadly surprised of the low ratings and bad comments that many people had write about this movie. Did we saw the same movie? Its not a master piece from Ridley Scott like Gladiator, but otherwise, was a very enjoyable movie.What I think is the main ""problem"" with Exodus is that is about one of the most memorable biblical tales, and many people are Bible fanatics, and they cant forgive if the story teller take some liberties and change some things in order to tell a history.I suppose that this people (bible fanatics) where expecting -naive idea- that Ridley Scott will film the life of Moses according to what is told in the bible, without changing anything, in order to keep those people happy and be political and religious correct. I am not a bible fanatic, actually I'm agnostic, so I'm very open to stories like this one or (Noah) that take a biblical tale, but don't take the bible like and unchangeable source that is not open to cinematography interpretation.None of us was there when Moses liberated the Jews from Egypt, so, how can somebody really argue that this movie is not ""accurate""? The bible is just a narration of some facts that may or may not happened thousands of years ago. And is open -like most of the historical tales- to interpretation. And I liked what I saw in Exodus. By far, Ridley Scott was and continue being one of the best directors in the business. Just a few days ago I watched Kingdom of Heaven (and its DVD extras) -the last epic movie of Scott before Exodus- and after seeing Exodus, you cant help but admire the work of Scott. His dedication to details, his guts to use and film in real environments against blue screens, how he has mastered the epic historic films like nobody else (Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, Exodus) and the fact that he have the GUTS to interpretate the history of Moses and make HIS VISION of this biblical tale.The bible is not a history book, I really doubt that most of the things mentioned in the bible really happened. Those tales are just that, TALES where some historical facts may had happened, but the bible is not a reliable source if somebody is only interested in the historical facts. Im sure that many of the things mentioned in the bible are legends, fables, and if those histories really happened, where, in fact, very different to what is told in the bible. So, is not a sin if somebody like Ridley Scott did his own interpretation of the life of Moses. You don't like it? Well, you are in your right to disagree, but don't rate this film so low just because it won't fit with what you learned at Sunday school in the church. Is not a perfect movie and have flaws, but historical accuracy is not the biggest of them.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

It was the same with Noah. Why, why, why, would you do that. Name your movie by amazing story from the Bible and then completely neglect written testament of this event. By the way, Moses was according to the Biblical writings, the meekest of all the people alive. He was all but arrogant, as he was portrayed in this movie.

Well that is what this movie is. Except the chain of events are explained even better. Ridley Scott does it again with this epic tail, told by a master film maker. It's not quite as good as Gladiator but very close. Christian Bale (Moses) and Joel Edgerton (Ramses) do an amazing job as friends and then obsessed enemies. John Turturro as Seti was a bit hard to take but he convinced me later in the movie that he was Seti. I think it was hard to take at first because of the other roles I have seen him do the past. Sigourney Weaver was a waste of an amazing actress as she only had what seemed like one or two lines.The movie has an amazing way of telling how all the plagues are a chain reaction to one another and really makes it all very believable. Ridley did everything he could ""in camera"" there are really some great full size sets in this. Everything else was photo real HUGE CGI effects that looked amazing and really kept you in the story.

443,andrei_balint92,Could have been so much more but in the end it ended up a mediocre movie,6,16 December 2014,"Watching this movie was like going to the most expensive overrated restaurant in town, you expect a miracle ,you pay a lot , you wait a lot and in the end all you are with is a feeling of self-loathing, boredom and the thought that maybe you should have stayed home and play some Dota instead . Unlike Noah , Riddley Scott's movie ""Exodus"" takes a less sci-fi view on the religious story of Exodus. It is based on the original story and does not want to distance itself too much from it but that doesn't actually mean it doesn't do it to some extent. The main plot is anchored to the original story and the changes done to it are only minor but here is where the movie is starting to send mixed messages.The depiction of Egyptian civilization and the 7 plagues start out as being realistic and the director wants to add a sort of cause-effect justification both to the 7 plagues and Egyptian policies ( alligators eat fish, fish rots , toads don't like water and come to the surface----etc) but that quickly fades away half-way through the movie being replaced with divine will(in the case of the 7 plagues) or stupidity( in the case of Egyptian policies). Judging from the plot you are left with the idea that this movies is written by two people in separate rooms with no communication whatsoever .The touch of originality is better underlined when it comes to the characters and their relationships(The relationship between god and Moises , between the Pharaoh and Moises, between Moises and the Jews and between Moises and Moises). This is where the movies just walks away from the biblical view-point and it does so in a way in which you are left with the question : "" What did it want to tell me ? "" . The type of messages it sends through these characters and the relationships between them are kinda mixed. Moises is presented as a more logical and agnostic type of person which relies on his own morality. God is presented as a spoiled brat who doesn't make any sense. The pharaoh is presented as person with some serious inferiority complexes and daddy issues. The Jews are just there looking for salvation. The relationship between god and Moises is tensed to say the least , god wants to free Jews by any means necessary after letting them be enslaved for 400 years for no reason but Moises wants the same thing but does not believe that ends justify the means. This relationship underlines a few interesting philosophical themes such as : morality and the aspects of divinity but they don't go in depth on any of them. In the end you are left with the impression that god is just a kid doing what he sees fit and Moises just deals with it and tries to make the best of it. The relationship between Moises and the pharaoh is totally underdeveloped from the start , you just start the movie with the fact that pharaoh hates Moises because he is better than him .So the pharaoh is constantly looking for reasons to remove him from the kingdom. Why ? Just he hates his face probably ...The relationship between God and the pharaoh ( Egiptians ) is a one sided one . Gods just hates them for enslaving the Jews . That does not make sense tho god being god by the way. He is portrayed in such a way in which it seems he likes killing innocent Egyptians which makes you wonder how bad Satan if god is that of a sadist.And finally the relationship between Moises and the Jews is portrayed as a totally standard leader-mass of oppressed people relationship .Nothing new added aside from the they want freedom , he promises freedom and they follow type of leadership.All in all the movie tries it's best to offer a new perspective on the story of exodus but it sticks too close to the original plot to be original and does not go in depth enough into the new aspects of the story so they can present a coherent message. After 3 hours you are left with the image of a movie which wasn't sure of what it wanted to be and couldn't be nothing more than mediocre at everything.Reminds me of my college days....",Exodus - Gods and Kings

447,thomas-r-jackson,Why not Mel?,6,4 January 2015,"The main problem with Exodus was the casting of Christian Bale as Moses. While clearly an actor of talent (e.g., American Psycho, American Hustle), especially in portrayals of less than admirable Americans (which he can do so well since he is Welsh), this was not a role suited to his limited abilities. Moses, of course, is just about the largest dramatic role conceivable. Richard Burton and Charlton Heston are now lost to us. Given that the director is Riddley Scott, we can only assume Russell Crowe was occupied in other projects. The obvious political correctness pressure to avoid offending powerful religious communities pretty much explains all the reasons Mel was not offered the part. Because it is hard to think of an actor who would not be more capable of playing Moses than Mel especially since in Scott's interpretation, Moses is arguably deranged. You really see the weakness of Bale's characterization in scenes with his wife and child. He is just about incapable of convincingly displaying anything remotely like passion or love for a human being (beside himself). He looks into his putative wife's eyes deeply as he is about to ""know"" her (in the Biblical sense) and that look has all the passionate intensity of a man trying to choose between ordering a cheeseburger or a cheeseburger with fries. Later, when he tells her he needs to leave for an indeterminate amount of time he has the look of conviction and the resolve of the man who has decided, yes, it will be a cheeseburger with fries. His scenes with his putative son are similarly passionless. After 10 years away he reunites with him by throwing stones into a trough and smiling weakly. This is a pretty sad display of paternal devotion. Most of the rest of the acting was pretty good, especially Sigourney Weaver as Ramses' mother and Joel Edgerton as Ramses. While Edgerton does OK with creating a not entirely one dimensional villain, everything Scott has done since Blade Runner only makes you wonder where the two geniuses went: the one who directed that movie and the actor Rutger Hauer who played the Replicant leader Roy. Now there was a villain! The 3D was pretty lame, the special affects good but not great and the movie dragged a bit in the bloated middle parts. It probably would have worked better if pared down by 15 or 20 minutes.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
448,zacktheman-175-161208,Christians are mocked,1,21 December 2014,"I say, either Hollywood or Ridley Scott thinks Christians are idiots that they would buy into their atheistic version of Moses. True scripture of exodus story, God is the ONE who free Israel from the Egyptian slavery, literally. This includes many miracles and no Hebrew army is required. Another word, God single handed did the job. But this film outrageously distort it so that any miracle (plaques) is naturally explained away, and any that can't be explained, like staff to snake and the pillar of fire and cloud, is eliminated from the film. Without these miracles, the Hebrew can't be released from bondage. In its place, the film would have an army to do the job. Another word, it was not really God, or so Hollywood and Scott would have us Christians believe. Yeah, the Christians misread scripture and the film is telling how an atheist would interpret it, like R. Scott (he's an atheist). With such distortion, what makes Hollywood and Scott think that they can attract Christians to this film, unless they truly think Christians are idiots. Here's an advice for Scott. It's a joke for an atheist to attempt to direct a biblical story to a movie. Stick to something you're good at. The film is doomed to fail, in monetary term. Hollywood should take heed, again.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
449,stcaudle-184-246708,Wow what a dud!,1,12 December 2014,Where to start. Acting was poor and unbelievable. Characters seemed to not reflect Mosses or Pharaoh. No reverence for God what so ever. It seemed like they were trying to leave an option that Moses imagined God and was possibly a bit crazy. God was played by a creepy child. Why make this movie and take that route? Moses is a powerful known story whether you believe or not. This does not work on any level at all. This movie was boring and mild as a kitten. Why try to be politically correct and appease the atheist? Make a powerful movie so everyone is happy. Why not part the Red Sea instead of draining bath tub? Don't waste your time.,Exodus - Gods and Kings
450,Vaduen,"What Could Have Been An Awesome Film, Is Simply Mediocre",4,15 December 2014,"Now I'm not a religious person at all, so this will be strictly from an objective point of view. We are told not to compare this movie to the original Ten Commandments from 1956. But, trust me, if you've seen the original film, that's all you are going to be doing during the movie.I enjoyed aspects of this movie, but, not all of it.The cinematography was awesome, the CGI graphics were absolutely great however, for a 2-1/2 hour film, they left just about everything that was important in the story completely out. It felt as if the film was jumping here and there in the storyline.The actors in the film didn't seem to be engrossed in their characters, just going through the motions. I found the most believable character to be John Turturro as Seti.This film didn't leave me pulling at emotions as it should have. At one point, I even asked myself ""When is this going to be over?"" Unlike the 1956 version of The Ten Commandments, which made me run the full range of emotions as I watched the film. That film flowed into a coherent storyline. Exodus: Gods and Kings did not.You don't see how Moses got into the palace as a family member, you just generally have to assume you already know. You really don't have any background on Moses. You don't see Moses repeatedly asking Pharaoh to let the ""people"" go, the plagues generally just show up. There is nothing biblical to me as to HOW the plagues of Egypt began.God is played as a small boy, about 10, and appears to Moses throughout the film, while those watching Moses talk to God, must surely think Moses is crazy, just standing there talking to himself since the others can't see God.Once Pharaoh frees the people, it's the usual trek out of Egypt, parting of the Red sea, well, it doesn't part, and, you have no idea why, nor is it even mentioned that the ""people"" had to wander in the desert for years to cleanse that generation which had sinned in the eyes of God.I suppose the biggest disappointment for me, is that you don't know, at least in the film, that Moses spent 40 days and nights on Mount Sinai. This was completely left out. Also, Moses is carving the Ten Commandments of God on stone tablets. This I feel will come as a slap in the face to most Christians.I suppose a generation that's never seen the Cecil B DeMille film from 1956 will probably like this film, but, they have taken way too many liberties with the actual text from the Bible. This is another film that yet doesn't follow scripture at all, being that Moses is a general in the film, instead of using the power of God to release the people, they go to war.Save your money, if you have to see it, wait for the DVD. This movie, it's gonna bomb at the box office after the opening weekend.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
451,rayadrian96-187-468568,"Superb Visual Technique, Bad Story...",5,16 December 2014,"As expected from Ridley Scott's movies, the visual effects in this movie are stunning and beautiful. Ridley Scott successfully recreate the Ancient Egypt with great details in both customs and cultures. The significant acting of Christian Bale and the casts also helps the audience to immerse themselves in the settings and situations that surround the Ancient Egypt. I must also praise the movie's visual effects on the Ten Plague because they are so believable and realistic.However, the superior aspects of the movie end here. The story of this movie is, in a sense, ordinary with unexceptional dialogues and dull climax. I am disappointed with Scott's interpretation of the story of Exodus from the Bible, especially with how God acts and works. I know that Scott tries to make all these aspects (especially the Ten Plague) as realistic as possible in order to combine them with the theme of the b, but they just don't work well with the story that actually tell how God free the Israelites from the oppression of Egypt.As the result, this movie might provide enjoyable entertainment for the audience, but it doesn't really work well with the main theme of the original story of Exodus.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
452,jlmunoz1,Spectacular,8,17 December 2014,"This was a very patient and well planned movie. These days movies cannot do without special effects, but they do a great job, and everything looks very real. Despite what people's complaints are about how the characters aren't real Egyptians, or anything else that's supposedly inaccurate, it's time for people to take a step back and see these movies for what they are. They bring out the importance of marriage, and they create an idea about God taking the form of a child, instead of being a booming voice. There isn't anything too different that throws off the main story. Biblical movies will always get the brunt of all criticism, but it's way better than watching yet another satanic movie about possession or human carnage.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
453,jenniferkf,"Entertaining, but it's not the story from the Bible.",5,7 March 2015,"I thought the acting, special effects, action scenes, and script were good. Overall I was entertained by the movie and if I was the usual viewer who had no knowledge of the actual story, probably wouldn't have many qualms.Instead of just looking at it the way anyone who actually believes the story would, seeing the incredible supernatural elements, Scott tries to explain everything away but then leaves you weirdly not able to explain the biggest parts.Bible: God turns the Nile to blood. Scott's movie: Crocs come out and kill a bunch of people, and apparently there's SO MUCH BLOOD that it kills all the fish. Then blood sends out the frogs and gnats, etc. The things he doesn't seem to be able to find natural causes for but still includes (strangely), are hail, boils, and finally the ""Angel of Death"".So many missed opportunities for incredible special effects. Honestly, this movie just made me long to see a much better and more accurate version of the Moses story: ""Prince of Egypt"".Did it even make it's money back? Huge budget and not a huge turn out right? If people are trying to appeal to the crowd who appreciates the Bible, they might want to find directors who don't dislike the Bible.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
454,Eyesalt,NOT Accurate..,1,19 March 2015,"It makes me wonder if anyone involved with the movie read anything at all from the book of Exodus, or maybe they just wanted to purposefully make up their own version of what they wanted it to be instead of actually basing it on the Bible.I mean, they have Moses fleeing for the wrong reason, a kid at the burning bush after some freak accident leaves Moses dazed, Moses not knowing he was Hebrew until he was grown, and many other things. They have a vengeful Moses with an attitude, which is the opposite of the Biblical one.. Moses was called the meekest man on earth (Num. 12:3).The bottom line is: if you want the real story, read the book of Exodus (KJV, IMO).",Exodus - Gods and Kings
455,pitcherpark,Inaccuries,7,24 May 2015,"The only reason I didn't give this movie 10 stars is because of the biblical inaccuracies. There was never any type of plague that involved alligators. This is just a movie about a man of God who the writers were curious about and then wrote/made something up. Just like there is no mention of Jesus from the time he was 14 until he was 30, never was a story really told in detail in the Bible about Moses and his dealings with his adopted father, Pharaoh. This is a fabricated fictional story of what the writers ""think"" happened while having Pharaoh as a father and what that might have been like. Moses never went into the desert like the movie portrays. He went of his own accord after he killed two Egyptians. Even in the movie they had that all wrong. He never met with anyone in the Hebrew camp that told him where he came from and that's not how it went down with the Egyptians. If you know your Bible, then you'll know that this is a fabricated story. If you don't know the Bible, then know that this is a fictional story about what ""might"" have happened to Moses and even then, what the writers have portrayed is a wrong story of what actually did happen. To me the movie is a lie about a great man of God that led people out of Israel. His legacy is in the Bible and not in this movie. Trust me. You know, God is very clear about adding to or taking away from His Word (Revelations) so I actually fear the fact that someone would write something up that is so far from the truth of what actually really happened.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
456,michaeldasilvapearce,A plausible and enthralling interpretation of the Biblical story,8,28 December 2015,"This is not a film for those who have a literal belief in the Bible. It needs to be viewed with at least an open mind. Atheists will really appreciate Ridley Scott's interpretation here. At face value it attempts to retell the Biblical story, but there are subtle hints pointing to Moses being a power crazed political activist who invents a god to give himself added authority. He is an opportunist who is able to use old prophecies and turn natural events into 'acts of god' to further his cause. Scott presents us with an image of God but portrays him a petulant boy and even goes so far as to suggest, he is figment of Moses imagination. Here, Scott is revisiting the main criticism that atheists make of religion i.e. a device for controlling the masses. This comes through very strongly at end of the film where we see Moses chiselling out the 10 commandants on the tablets of stone. God is present but by now we know this is just a personification of Moses' alter ego. Given this backdrop, the film is riveting to watch. The direction and acting are brilliant but if you are looking to relive some mystical religious experience I think you will be very disappointed. It does not attempt to do this so you will not find it. I can therefore understand some of the negative reviews on here although I rather suspect they are coordinated by a group of closed minded christians bent on undermining the success this film wholeheartedly deserves. Personally I may have wanted to see something that is more critical of the god concept and religion, but I think in this instance it would have undermined the plausibility of Scott's interpretation of the Biblical story. If a Moses ever did exist this may very well be something closer to the truth.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
457,adamhoulding,Keeping It Simple,7,14 May 2015,"This film is good. There, I've said it. It's not the best biblical film, but it's certainly not the worst. It tries to give a 'realistic' take on the bible story of Exodus and at times it really really works. The cinematography is great, the acting - while at times only passable - is sound and the narrative is good. The idea of the Parting of the Red Sea as a tsunami is my personal favourite idea, as the idea that Ramses is simply evil or only envious of Moses.Some find it controversial that Moses uses sabotage tactics akin to modern guerrilla groups, and that the plagues affected everyone both Egyptian and Jewish. They don't bother me as a Christian, but I can understand why some might. The overuse of white actors does bother me a little, but it's simply Hollywood politics. Charlton Heston was as white as they came, but nobody complained about him or the fact he visually clashed with the 'ethnic' Yul Brynner.Overall, a decent bible movie that tries something fresh. Not everyone will like it, but it's certainly different. It's no Prince of Egypt, but it's absolutely not the Innocence of Muslims. It is a good Ridley Scott movie, akin to his Robin Hood interpretation.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Red Sea scene powerful and even believable; sets a lot more realistic than Charlton Heston's 'clean' version of the slave pits - and the plagues were easier to believe as natural consequences of a corrupt system than a magic staff wielded by a former NRA spokesperson.Not a film for Bible literalists, I'm afraid, though that actually made it that much more interesting to me. And I disagree with those who found the presence of some recognizable faces as 'trivializing' - the thrill of seeing great actors in tiny roles was wonderful. Thought both leading actors did a great job.

460,FMeekins,A Review Of Exodus: Gods & Kings,7,31 May 2016,"****May Contain Spoilers***** It wasn't that ""Exodus"" God & Kings"" was that bad of a movie.It is more that it could have been better.The narrative did succeed in creating dramatic interpersonal tension between Moses and Pharaoh by emphasizing the intertwined family relationships of the two characters.While the film strives to acknowledge in its own way the broad strokes of the Biblical saga, the producers could have done a better job of honoring and adhering to the specifics of the text.For example, though Aaron is given a supporting role in the story, he tends to look on as Moses haggles with God.The audience is left to wonder if deity is actually communicating with the prophet or merely a delusion initially induced by a cranial trauma.Given that the director was Ridley Scott, for all we know the entity manifesting itself in the form of a young boy claiming to be God could have been related to the creatures from the Alien films and alluded to in Prometheus.With special affects advanced as they are as evidenced in the scenes depicting the assorted plagues, it was a disappointment that there was not a scene depicting the encounter where Aaron's rod consumed the rods of the Egyptian magicians that turned into serpents.But I guess it was more important to focus on extra-Biblical details like raids on Hittite encampments and characterizing Moses as some kind of guerrilla in the tradition of Che Guevara or Emilio Aguinaldo.by Frederick Meekins",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This story has always fascinated me, from a non-religious view. And I truly enjoyed the action-based scenes, which often are my favourites. I do feel as though some background story should have been provided with more screen time. And I did not much care for Moses and his character as it developed throughout the film.

However, unlike most, I'm an even bigger fan of his critically panned epic ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and with that in mind I thought this film would be great regardless of the bad reviews...Boy was I wrong...this was nothing short of an epic steaming pile of sh!t with a few redeeming qualities that gave it an extra star. Let's start with the GOOD. The acting by Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton was top notch as you would expect. You can tell these two are doing the best they can and actually managed to create some interesting characters. Also, the visuals were very well done. I've never been big on CGI but the quality was not the problem here, rather it's overuse. The size and scope of the production was massive and quite impressive. The costume design was very good as it is with all Ridley Scott films. The cinematography and landscape shots were quite beautiful to look at.

Whenever Biblical material is tackled, there are two groups the director must please: religious folks, who expect word for word Biblical accuracy, and non-religious folks, who just want an action packed movie, which is not overtly religious. This film doesn't please either of these two groups. So Exodus was destined to receive bad reviews, which is a shame, because it is a spectacular film.

There were no ""let my people go"" moments. Director Scott has done his utmost to present the plagues as occurring due to natural phenomena.I wonder whether he tried to think of a way to make the killing of the first born seem natural too, although to his credit, he didn't attempt such folly.His presentation of God as a nasty, vengeful, precocious brat was unsettling, to say the least and I must admit to being slightly offended by his choice of metaphor.Aaron too, a central character in the biblical account, was relegated to the level of an also ran, despite his having been accredited as Moses' 'mouthpiece'.The film was overly reliant on (in my opinion mediocre) special effects, and very thin on getting the best out of the actors, all of whom have, and could have, done much better.This is an ideal movie to showcase special effects but Scott's need to retell the story with his own (anti?) biblical slant, missed many opportunities to create a spectacular epic.Raining hail and fire was missing, the plagues being presented as a natural course of events.We also didn't get the snakes, Moses starting the plague of blood or any of them, he was relegated to the role of a spectator.No clouds by day and pillar of fire by night.In leaving out so much of the original story, Scott has relegated what could have been a grand epic to 'just another movie', one where I found myself hitting the fast forward so I could get to the end and then to bed.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This movie had excellent visuals, and the integration of CGI was welcomed and not too too overbearing... But that's where the praise ends. 1) the basis of this movie is supposed to be from Exodus (hence the name) in the bible. Was there not a single bible believing person to oversee the script? Much like how there is a weapons expert, martial arts, military personnel, or scientist for other movies to maintain authenticity, this one had none. Completely blatant liberties taken that make me wonder where they writing fine script from memory from when they were a kid? 2) Casting. As you've heard, there were many people boycotting this film because of the fact that Egypt is in North Africa and not a small village in Greenwich England. The British accents, I mean Australian accent, I mean American... You get the point. The cast was horrendous. It made me feel like I was watching marina, troy, or some other tale. Problem is... Marina was closer to the books than this is to the bible. 3)God. The beauty of the bible for those who don't understand is that God does what he does out of his love for us. Not out of some form of a grudge and spite. In this movie, Ridley Scott made the British accented boy a bit of a huge prick. He seemed to be doing everything out of wrath and to upstage Moses instead of to show he is supreme and free his chosen people. I struggle to understand how a movie such as this could be so far from the truth when it's produced by an industry full of people that is from this lineage. It would be like a group of NBA players ruining a basketball scene in a movie. Regardless to ho you feel about Mel Gibson, he would have done a much more accurate job of capturing the essence and telling the story.. If this movie was just called Gods and Kings, I would have graded it higher, but when it's supposed to be based on the bible, it has to hold up.

Not a lot of build up and excitement despite the escape from Egypt and pursuit. No stand out music. It left me feeling flat. So much money must have been thrown at this movie and so little of it was spent on script development or even research. What really jarred for me were characters tearing around on horseback with modern bridles and saddles. Come on that is pretty slack. It strayed a bit from the Bible story, but I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing of itself, it is just that some more religious viewers may be disappointed.

Exodus is one of those movies which has been written thousands of years ago and it just spoils the fun when Hollywood decides to change the plot and the real story of the movie.Exodus is the story of Moses(peace be upon him) and the real story does not match the movie story even by 50% which was a total disappointment for me because i expected some truth from this movie.So what are the major faults of the movie ????? Moses and Ramses were never friends because in the real story Ramses does not exist and hence he never claimed to be the GOD. However Pharaoh himself did want to be the GOD so the story has been totally changed in this case. Moses does not defeat Ramses in the sea because once again Ramses does not exist, he however defeated Pharaoh. Another mistake that made me sad was GOD never ever kills innocents nor he punishes them, he never killed the kids with the plague or darkness, this is mocking god because he did not do that.The story of the movie was a total disappointment for me, i did love the effects and the graphic but the story was totally altered which is why i think the movie was a disaster and rated it only 2.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The scenes of war in which the Bale saves the Ramesses , plagues spreading the Egypt , huge construction sites in the kingdom and the panoramic view of mountains are some of the manifestations of brilliant visual effects.Perhaps, the best visuals of the movie is the way storm is shot.

He gets across how much of a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully Yahweh is in the Old Testament. That being said, the movie it self has many problems. Even though it has very good visual effects, the movie and characters leave a lot to be desired.

As my research and articles I've read showed me that pharaoh can't be him. So, who was the pharaoh died into RedSea while following Prophet Moses? They say that pharaoh was Ramses II but he reigned for 67 years during the 19th dynasty of the 12th century BC. He known as one of the Egypt's greatest warrior, but also a peace maker and for the monuments he left behind all over Egypt.He was the first king in history to sign a peace treaty with enemies. After the war of Kadesh the Egyptian –Hittite peace treaty was concluded between Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II and Hittite King Hattusili III. This peace treaty was written the wall of Abu Simbel Tempels and the wall of some Hittite Temples which are not being able to see this times but a copy of peace treaty stone is being in Istanbul Archaeological Museum.In fact that, that pharaoh can't be Ramses II, Idk why Hollywood insist to use his name but he was just a successful pharaoh whom also known Ramses the Great.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This movie HAS got to be funded by some Scientology movement. God has been completely removed from this movie altogether. Moses carries a sword, not a staff and has nothing to do with the plagues. I felt they were trying to leave the impression that Moses was crazy and these ""random"" occurrences just happened to coincidentally happen around him. Or Moses was crazy and lied about most of the story. In another sense, fortunately, they failed. Very, very late in the movie you add everything back up and realize there's no way this many ""random"" events coincidentally happens to one person. It's a terrible movie.

To be honest I don't think he will direct a really great movie like Blade Runner, but his movies after this were not that bad as this one.I am not going to discuss about errors in the story, since there is no real history in that time, but the story even as it was told has flaws (can't discuss them to avoid spoilers). But this is not the real problem.I really couldn't figure out what the movie is trying to do: Is it a epic movie based on special effects?

482,bugman160,Not as bad as people make it out to be....I was entertained....which is what Studio Movies are meant to do!!!,7,2 June 2015,"Watched Exodus: Gods and Kings last night. Given the reviews and laments of THE INTERNET, I thought it was pretty entertaining and relatively accurate (given my Bibilical knowledge). Many complained that it wasn't The Ten Commandments, which I found to be overacted and Hollywoodized (e.g., ""Kiss me Moses. Kiss me. Hold me in your arms.""), because they didn't depict the ten plagues and parting of the Red Sea with more grandeur like The Ten Commandments. In fact they went with very subtle, naturalistic miracles (even to the point that one of the scholars in Ramses' court was trying to explain away all of the plagues with ""Egyptian scientific"" reasoning that could be plausible). Other's complained about the depiction of God's interaction with Moses (lookup Malek which is in the credits people), which I took to be artistic license that did not detract from the story or contradict the source material core story. Others complained about some statements that Christian Bale made about Moses, which I took to be about the character Moses and how he was portraying it...his realistic acting approach for this film, and not necessarily about what he thought about the Bibilical figure of Moses beyond the scope of the film. I found it to be a very serious portrayal that attempted to be somewhat archaeologically accurate (at least compared to The Ten Commandments) given what we can piece together (I suggest reading From Eden to Exile by Eric H. Cline, published by National Geograhic, for an accurate depiction of the limitations of Biblical Archeology for corroboration of the accounts of Exodus, etc.) despite several historical object anachronisms and some unimportant divergence from Biblical accounts. It was not overly brutal, but it did deal with the treatment of the Hebrew slaves in a serious manner. Far more enjoyable than watching Noah, which was filled with tons of artistic interpretation due the lack of source biblical text to base the story (a few chapters of Genesis for Noah compared to the whole Book of Exodus and some potential supplemental material from 3 other books of the Torah for Moses).",Exodus - Gods and Kings

And I won't comment on the plot because it is basically what we have been taught in schools about the Hebrews being slaves to Egyptians (only a tad bit stretched because a movie needs its ""wow moments"" as I like to call them. If anyone wants historical accuracy about what happened back then, better read a book.

It's a movie that is worthy for at least 7 Oscars, because Hollywood normally tells Christian stories in a dark negative way, but this movie can stand in a church, and be shown to people that don't know so much abut Christianity, because the movie tells so clear how the story is.

Poor writing and dialogue. Having modern dialogue in an ancient setting just makes each scene laughable. Poor cast selection. Never bought in to any of the actors as the characters they were portraying. John Turturro as Seti and Christian Bale as Moses, really?How do you make a movie about God, faith, and miracles, and try to downplay all the exciting elements just because of their biblical nature?

Save money and watch something else. I recommend ""The Ten Commandments"" by Cecil B. deMille.I am familiar with the story of Moses, having been brought up with the Bible. But there is nothing I recognize in the two-dimensional character portrayed by Mr. Bale. There's no emotion, no alignment of purpose, no raison-d'etre, no compelling argument why this man was able to free the enslaved Jews from Egypt.We see Moses talking to God, which is what he does, but he is witnessed by others and they don't make anything of his strange behavior, apparently talking to himself. Why? It confounds me. Similarly, the plagues that ravaged Egypt appear out of the sky, with no mention of the threat Moses made to the Pharaoh that these would befall Egypt if he did not let go of the Jews. Where did this come from? How come all these people are suddenly following Moses? I don't get it.This movie comes in 3D for no reason, like many movies these days, totally unnecessary and only serving to fleece customers.I was disappointed. I am no follower of Mr. Bale, I just don't like him as an actor, but Mr. Scott, who directed my favorite music video and for whom I have high respect, I expected more. It's not here. It's not awful, but doesn't deserve any stars.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
488,Loly_liker,Extremely Overrated and Easily Dislikable,5,26 December 2014,"You may be wondering, why I'm rating this movie a 5 instead of 3 or 2. Well There were some really good aspects about this film. Those include Christian Bale's acting. He delivered an excellent performance, gave the best he could, but it wasn't good enough. Christian Bale's acting is fantastic, yes, but he absolutely does NOT suit this type film. The way I would put it is that, it doesn't not suit his type of profession within the acting industry. Secondly, the CGI was great. Excellent job on that and especially the action. Now lets get to parts I hated about this movie. It had no proper storyline. The script was so poorly written that it made the great actors, i.e. Christian Bale, look like a bad actor. The casting was ridicule. As a full blooded Egyptian, I am disgusted by the casting of this movie. They should have gotten it right by not casting actors as white a sheets for Pharaohs and only casting Black people as slaves (Hmm, doesn't that remind you of something? Wake up America). What was also extremely unnecessary was that they casted someone as great as Sigourney Weaver to play a role as a character who only stood there for 2 minutes of the entire movie with only very few lines. It's just sad. Lastly what annoyed me so damn much was that Moses had a sword instead of the wooden staff. What made is worse for me is that the sea wasn't split the way it should have been. It should have been with a bloody staff in which Moses should have had the power to control.Man, this film was a huge disappointment. I expected more than this.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Christian Bale and Ben Kingsley don't get involved in many bad movies, so this caught me by surprise. Despite the title, the movie has virtually no resemblance to the biblical account in Exodus. So the faith-based audience is not going to like it. For the rest of those watching, the storyline is hard to follow and doesn't make sense at times. There are subtle messages that people won't pick up on unless they are knowledgeable of the actual Exodus account. For example the scene in the distance with the gold calf idol. Character development fell short. The one redeeming quality is some cool graphics, that will save the movie ratings.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

While watching, especially when the Israelites are fleeing Egypt, it feels very different than what one reads in the Bible.The special effects are one of the movie's strongest points, especially when the ten plagues are brought in. The parting of the Red Sea was brilliantly done as well, although in a very different way than expected.Overall, this movie is fun, but if you want to learn about the Exodus story as told in the Bible, it might be a good idea to take the events in the movie with a grain of salt.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Moses did not fight and argue with God like displayed, from the very beginning he fell to the ground at the burning bush and trembled, but this movie would have one believe he argued with a child, which in itself is a lie since God spoke personally with Moses and didn't go through a messenger. Moses went to Pharaoh directly and warned and demanded Pharaoh before any plaques which the movie ignores, showing that God always give man a chance to repent before being judged for his transgressions, Pharaoh brought these plaques upon his people by choice, so as it will be with you the reader who mocks the living God, sooner than you think the day of your accountability as my own will come upon us.

From start to finish, the intensity never changes, and is personified by Ramses character, who just seems to go from being Moses' friend to being his enemy without so much as a snarl or raising his voice or an eyebrow.The script is lifeless and this movie just goes through the motions of getting from A to B without ever getting us to have the slightest care for the characters. Moses gets the boot from Memphis, meets a hot farmer chick, marries her, gets permission to ""proceed"" and as a result has a kid on the way in the space of 15 minutes. My eyes rolled.Bale isn't bad given what he has to work with but the rest of the cast is an ensemble of well known actors essentially playing fancy dress. Sigourney Weaver is just Sigourney Weaver with a funny hat, Ewen Bremner is ""Spud"" in a funny hat, Ben Mendelsohn is ""Dickus Biggus"" and John Turturro (while not to bad in his brief role) also gets in on the laugh.

496,joeernie26,"As movies go, Exodus should've gone into Exile",3,27 December 2014,"While I may be a Christian, I do enjoy a good movie like anyone else. And so, I didn't go into this movie expecting it to stay true to the biblical story. Ridley Scott revealed most of the miracles as semi-natural or simply as a coincidence. I was expecting that. But, here's my main critique: First of all, God as a child. That just seemed strange that they picked the person who talks to Moses as God to be a child. There were a few times when it just seemed weird. Hearing a child say the things God says felt almost laughable. The God who inspired Moses to speak to Pharaoh is a child.Second, Moses doesn't believe God at all. I mean, even after the plagues, he still barely believes in or follows God until the Israelites cross the Red Sea. It felt as though the filmmakers tried to make this a climatic event, but it kind of fails. I know, it's a movie.Third, it was way too long for its own good. Too many shots of people going places, and after the first hour or so, Moses isn't even exiled yet. You could've almost had two movies because there was more of a build-up to Moses' exile than there was to the crossing of the Red Sea. Also, the editing was sloppy, sometimes scenes were cut too quickly and at other times you were left there wondering ""How long is this thing?"" A good movie should never make you ask that question.Fourth, the Red Sea crossing. This puzzled me, because it felt like the filmmakers couldn't make up their mind. The sea is shown to recede because of a natural occurrence, okay. Cool. But, suddenly when the Egyptian Army starts to cross the sea, a huge wave engulfs them. Natural occurrence? Water gently recedes and then suddenly appears as a 12-story wall of water that somehow Moses survives? (Yes, Moses is still crossing. Actually he's waiting to meet Ramses one last time) So, miracle or not? The filmmakers didn't seem to know the answer to that question.I was expecting a better told story. Exodus: Gods and Kings has a lengthy script that never climaxes, and characters you truly never care about. Character development is so little that everyone seems shallow. The only 3-dimensional character we have is Ramses, and you never once feel sorry for him. Sorry, Ridley Scott, you get three stars for story.

I do like how Ridley Scott used the little boy as part of the communication of God to Moses. This was certainly a different twist to move along the story of Exodus. In the original Ten Commandments with the fate God reigned on the Egyptians, in detail, took up lots of time.

Christian Bale's performance was shameless. He should not have taken this role. Moses & Ramesses should have been played by middle eastern actors. I could not believe how bad this movie was.

502,timothykirk0,"Scott chooses his faith over his art, and his art fails.",4,25 December 2014,"Divorced from its supernatural moorings, Exodus: Gods and Kings becomes a curious, episodic feast of special effects, but too much of the story is either cut outright or lost in the hurry to get to the next ""epic scene."" Character development is arrested, dialogue is stilted, and there are lapses and holes everywhere. One glaring example: the missing pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. The source material is rather clear on this point: ""And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night"" (Exodus 13:21 – KJV). Why was it cut? Well, it wasn't cut. It was never made. Don't miss the logic here: If one's intention is to do a ""Thomas Jefferson"" to the Old Testament, one cannot excise the supernatural everywhere and leave in a glaring example of unintelligible divine intervention. So the CGI effects are cool but the pillar gets the boot. Without the Scripture's clear sense of mission, the narrative bleeds out at points, and although one gets a sense of trajectory, the pacing staggers and the story trudges along mechanically.Not only does it plod along, but the subtle but observable undermining of the story's lifeblood ""stings""—it offends the sensibilities of religious adherents. The storytelling is fragmented, not only because of ""liberties"" taken, but also because the story has been robbed of the power of its grand narrative. It is a thumb in the eye for anyone who believes that something of grave significance (something in space/time history) occurred between the historical figure, Moses, and the Creator of the universe, God. For that audience, the film is not just a disappointment: it is an affront. There was a shadow in my mind as I exited the theater, but I eventually had an epiphany and embraced the irony: In Scott's Bible story—God is dead. Scott pierces the heart of the enduring story by killing off its very source of power—hence, why it plods and stings. The central protagonist of Scott's story is Moses, but the protagonist of the biblical epic is not a man; it is YHWH. In Scott's attempt to tell the story from a naturalistic, godless vantage point, the Great ""I Am"" is reduced to a figment of Moses's imagination. The story's great protagonist is replaced by a diminutive, delusional Moses, who wields a sword instead of a staff and who is a half-ass prophet instead of a whole-ass servant of the Most High God. Scott's ""god"" is a coy, sniveling, vengeful bully—a petulant child (by design); his hero (Moses) is a delusional everyman. God is a myth; Moses is a fool. Scott has replaced the God of the Old Testament with the god of Richard Dawkins' shriveled, bedeviled imagination. What should have been an epic drama is replaced with a collection of cinematic shards. Ridley Scott knows better, but as a filmmaker, he chose his faith over his art. And his art failed.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Not that it HAS to be, but it was almost nothing like the real Biblical account of this story. (Just tell us that so we can decide if we want to go). The part I REALLY don't get is that the real story is so much better than the contrived story in the movie. They make Moses look like he and God disagreed about everything, and they added characters (one throughout the entire movie) that were just bizarre and had no place in it. The plagues look like nothing more than a string of natural events. I hate to say it, but the movie, almost from start to finish, was set up to make God look like a bully. (I mean, poor, poor, nice Pharaoh who was just misunderstood in his torture and enslavement of millions of people).Maybe Mr. Scott's next movie will be about the Holocaust, and will portray God and Jewish people in general as bullies trying to escape for no reason, and Hitler as a misunderstood victim.

There was no connection established with any of the characters. I mean, for me, this missed every opportunity it had to be something memorable.

505,meego11,Worth it for the effects,7,21 December 2014,"The effects in this film are phenomenal. I don't understand why this film got such a bad rap, I thought that this film was very enjoyable to watch. The opening scene is very gripping and sets the story well, however the downfall is how Moses perceives God as a young child, this worked at the end but was too confusing at the beginning, I didn't know if it was a random kid or actually God. Despite the constant dispute over how the story was inaccurate and poorly constructed, this film is still thoroughly stimulating and captivating. Possibly the worst part of the movie is how slow the first chunk is, when Moses gets banished and finds his wife, the story slows down, but is made up terrifically by the fast- paced suspense scenes of the plagues and the epic finale of the wave. The acting is absolutely awesome, Christian Bale is on point as he always is and Joel Edgerton is a little wooden at times but compelling nonetheless. However the character that stands out the most is Viceroy Hegep played by the ever talented Ben Mendelsohn, the subtle gay undertones and pure nastiness of this character make the movie that much more enjoyable, plus Mendelsohn pulls the character off tremendously,by adding a slightly sassy edge to all his dialogue. This character stole the movie for me. Growing up on a healthy dose of Ridley Scott and the 'Alien' franchise I was slightly disappointed by this movie, however the good points (for me) outweigh the bad.

Don't waste money.Total miscast, Rameses looks like half-Korean. Moses and Rameses wives' look Indian. I think Rameses' wife is really an Indian actress. Moses and Zipporah's wedding look like a Bollywood wedding, I was waiting for them to dance Jai-Ho, because seriously, with so much ridiculous things in the movie, this won't surprise me. The Hebrews look like barbaric, drug addicts who have no respect for themselves and don't want to check themselves in rehab... I didn't see a legit middle eastern in the movie. Man, they've got nothing on Yul Brynner, Charleton Heston and the ladies in the 1956 movies.Emotionless - And it affected me... I don't really know how I would feel watching the movie. Not sure if i would leave or sleep or stay or what. I didn't know the right answer. Maybe that emotion is not invented yet.God here is a bratty little boy. This is an insult to the true God and to the audience...The burning bush looks like a bonfire in some lame camping ground..Don't ever wait for parting of the Red Sea, the water just receded like it was low tide and the Hebrews swam/crawl in the flood .. it was corny Moses had no staff. He had a sword.Moses never wore a Levite dress, He wore a gladiator outfit.Moses hairstyle keeps on changing inconsistently thru the movie.The Hebrew faces' look sad while marching leaving Egypt... after 400 years of slavery, they probably miss building bricks.I'm not sure if the movie wanted me to believe whether or not there is God. It is not the real story folks. You'd be extremely disappointed if you would like to see the actual Bible Story in the Book of Exodus.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The trailer promised it as the biggest release of the year but actually the trailer showed everything there was to see in the movie. There's never a full fledged actual fight/war scene among the oppositions..Moses doesn't even have to fight..God does everything for him. And I can never tell how the hell all the infants just died under an overcasting shadow.Seriously this movie is not worth the time. The only thing that has been looked into is the 3D screenplay, which was the only thing that helped to watch the movie completely.Looking at the star cast of this movie having so many big names..it was a waste for their acting as they didn't have much to do.

The cinematography and visual effects are spectacular to behold but the script is very nondescript.2) I love Christian Bale and he didn't disappoint. He is quite possible the only good thing in the movie aside from the visual effects. 3) Whilst I understand the necessity for back story in order to create a contextual setting, this movie feels a little heavy on back-story. Two thirds of the movie is spent concentrating on Moses' life story and then it feels as though the plagues that befall Egypt and the freeing of the Israelites is subsidiary.4) The most disappointing part of this movie is that I personally came out of it feeling like i neither liked or disliked it. It smacked of mediocrity.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The cast looked fairly impressive. Christain Bale has done some fine work lately so I was expecting a pretty decent movie. Joel Edgerton was completely unbelievable a Ramses. And come on... what's with all the English accents? Special effects were average. Story line was what you'd expect. Acting was pretty weak in parts. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up.

I also want a plot to be intriguing, and the dialog smart. The movie ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" provided none of the attributes I look for: plot is trite and the interactions are cliché. The characters seem to be modelling the latest ancient Egyptian fashion throughout a very predictable series of events. Two warrior heroes, brandishing slick, ornate steel swords (in the Egyptian bronze age) just doesn't cut it for realism, and the overall effect of the flick was to leave me wondering why I wasted the time.

513,olhwatson-22336,filmbuffer.com,2,3 May 2015,"Directed by Ridley Scott and staring, Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, Sir Ben Kingsley and Aaron Paul. A retelling of the famous Biblical passage from the Bible depicting Moses rising up against his Ramses in order to free the Hebrews from Egypt.There is no doubt that no one can argue that this film is not absolutely breathtakingly beautiful with some really well designed and developed shots such as visually seeing Egypt from high in the sky, to the effects of the plague as the city is rampaged numerous times. It begins with as an interesting adaptation of a famous story as we jump straight into adulthood, however as strong as it begins narration is not quite enough to maintain our attention for the full two and half hour long journey.The issue that many had when viewing this film was large amount of white actors taking roles that some felt did not belong to them. Whatever yours issues may be, the cast has bigger issues with the likes of Aaron Paul and Sir Ben Kingsley hardly used which seems a crime onto itself. Christian Bale is good, but this role is not a stretch for him in any shape which is frustrating as he could have played this role bigger, better and with more of an interesting presence. Joel Edgerton on the other hand suffers in a different way, his tanning sessions become increasingly odder throughout as he begins the film looking incredibly tanned and ends by looking like the whitest man on earth. Now some will argue that this is due to his extensive travelling over different lands to chase Moses, why then is he the only one to be effected by the lack of tan.God plays a role in this film, as you would expect from the passage in the bible. No Morgan Freeman this time but instead a small child depicts the angry God. Some would argue that this works and it is interesting that we see Moses and God's interaction from a third person which refreshingly is quickly accepted rather than simply accused of being mad which would become the focus.The plagues themselves are quite clever and interesting to witness, however I feel this summarises the film to a point. Visually this film is excellent, baring the 'parting' of the red which feels anticlimactic when the apprehension as been built for some time that you expect a more faithful scene to the bible. The narrative really struggles to maintain interest for the two and half hours.OVERALL ** Though visually stunning, the narration begins as an interesting adaption but it not able to maintain our focus for the full 2 and a half hour film with an ultimately unsatisfying finish.RECOMMENDATION - Not the best adaptation but by no means the worst, it simply lacks a finesse that makes this film either memorable or stay with you long after having watched it.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
514,skidberna,Inaccurate,3,4 July 2015,"I don't think someone could have made a more unrealistic movie of Exodus if it contained Darth Vader as Pharaoh. Really, this was bad. It had many inaccuracies, many of which were vital to the entire plot of the movie. Moses never has his staff turn into a snake and does not talk to Pharaoh as he does in the real account. Plus it portrays god as a ten year old boy???? Moses is portrayed as a haughty leader rather than a humble follower of God. I saw over 30 inaccuracies and I'm sure I missed a few. Moses never even parts the read sea and Pharaoh does not die! This movie leaves much out and fabricates much in. It is not even accurate historically by secular standards, much less accurate to the biblical account.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

They take something out of the Torah or Old Testament (however you want to put it) and completely mess it up. Its borderline sacrilegious and disgusting. They most despicable part of this flop is that Moshe is taking to G-d through a boy not a burning bush. On top of that throughout the entire movie he argues with him and even yells at him (the kind of arguing you would have with a sibling). There is very, very little mention of faith and only alludes to the premise that G-d is causing these plagues and that G-d has the upper hand in all of this. The plagues are not even in order and they only show a few. They did very little research into the book of Exodus. PLEASE Don't WATCH THIS. Watch ""The Ten Commandments"" instead with Charleton Heston. That is at least more in line. Then again Charleton Heston is Jewish and he would never had played in this total train wreck of a movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
517,alfalfa116,Good but needs to be longer,8,6 December 2014,"This is an exceptionally well made movie but it needs to be at least 30 mins longer in the first 80 mins where character development and political & personal subplots can be fleshed out. As previously discussed scenes seem short and end abruptly where in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS they had narration to help the story along and it also helped that it was over 3 1/2 hours long and this movie is way short of that. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in this version and the political intrigue and descent from the rank of brother to outcast was too quick. On the plus side the plagues are well told explaining in a more logical manner how and why the plagues happen. The chariot chase along a narrow winding mountain path is awesome when the inevitable crash and fall of the cliff happens and then parting of the RED SEA occurs, not so much the sea leaving but the return in the form of a giant tsunami (which beats the INTERSTELLAR one) and the tornadoes (which leave the ones in INTO THE STORM for dead) are fantastic. Both our stars face off in front of the tsunami as it swamps them both and they survive swimming to alternate shores, this was purely ridiculous as they should've drowned. The end is quick and abrupt, ticking the boxes (the gold bull and the ten commandments written by Moses in stone) but I still felt this was easier to sit through than the recent heavier movie NOAH but they would make a great double bill. The 3-D is very good in the depth of field range, it felt very real but when seeing it in IMAX the ratio was 2.35:1 all the way through and I payed $30 and I got no IMAX footage, so see it on a giant screen but don't get ripped off.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This movie is one of, if not the worst, depiction of any Bible narrative I have ever seen. The inaccuracies in this movie are almost immeasurable in comparison to the real Bible narrative of Moses and the Exodus. There is such a thing as poetic license and then there is just straight Hollywood pablum. If you are a Christian and love the beautiful story of Moses and the Exodus and have yet to see this movie, please don't waste your time or intelligence. If you are not a Christian, this comes nowhere near depicting the events of the story of Moses in the Bible. If you are still inclined to watch this horrible abomination, read the book of Exodus in the Bible first, then you will see how terribly skewed this depiction is.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

If you cannot read, then watch the cartoon, the Prince of Egypt, it is way better. Not worth renting... So you think you are going to see one of the great stories of the Bible by watching this, guess again. Why, why, why, would you alter the 2000+ year old account of the Exodus that still amazes, to present some rubbish twist of the account that WAS written by Moses. So to tell it otherwise with Moses as main character is frustrating. Also, to portray God as a emotional child who always bickering with Moses and vise versa, not the humbled man Moses is told to be, it is not the God of the Bible or the man Moses (shows complete ignorance of the writers and those involved in the production). God uses man to accomplish his goals, he used Moses and demonstrated his power through him, from the burning bush to using the staff, to parting the water... This movie just gets it all wrong, visual affects are great, acting is good. So why one star? You can't allow ignorant people to just rewrite history to give your own twist on events that is totally an unnecessary change, and get away with it because of technology and CGI.

It suggests it's a portrayal of the account in the Tanach and Bliblical Old Testament of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt. The story is almost completely made up in the mind of author and is not taken at all from the manuscripts in which the account actually exists. It is insulting to the devout Jew and Christin alike.

524,bulletswimmer,"Horrible movie - Coming from a fan of ""Kingdom of Heaven""",2,12 December 2014,"I went into this movie for the most part ignoring the bad reviews. Like most, I have always been a big fan of Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"". However, unlike most, I'm an even bigger fan of his critically panned epic ""Kingdom of Heaven"", and with that in mind I thought this film would be great regardless of the bad reviews...Boy was I wrong...this was nothing short of an epic steaming pile of sh!t with a few redeeming qualities that gave it an extra star. Let's start with the GOOD. The acting by Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton was top notch as you would expect. You can tell these two are doing the best they can and actually managed to create some interesting characters. Also, the visuals were very well done. I've never been big on CGI but the quality was not the problem here, rather it's overuse. The size and scope of the production was massive and quite impressive. The costume design was very good as it is with all Ridley Scott films. The cinematography and landscape shots were quite beautiful to look at. From the visuals alone, starting from the very first battle scene, you would think you were in for a masterpiece.....But you couldn't be more wrong. The BAD: ...Horrible casting choices. I had heard about the casting criticisms since the arrival of the first trailer. A lot of people complained about Ridley's choice of Orlando Bloom in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" saying that he was too young and whimpy to be a convincing commander of armies. I disagreed with this. Even though I am not a fan of Bloom I thought he did a fine job in the role...Another criticism I had heard about Exodus was that they should have chosen Egyptian actors instead of white English/Americans. This reminded me of the criticisms surrounding the film ""Prince of Persia"" in 2010 which featured non Persian actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, exc). I was one of the few people who was not at all offended by this at the time even though I am of Persian descent. The west simply has better actors....So I went into Exodus with the same mind set, but this time the critics were right. The casting choices were horrible and borderline offensive. I mean really John Turturro?? Ewen Bremner?? Ben Mendelsohn?? Aaron Paul?? Sigourney Weaver??. No one looked like they actually belonged in this film. Hours worth of professional makeup cannot disguise this cast as Egyptians. When we watch Gladiator we do not see Russle Crowe on screen, we see Maximus. When we watch Lord of the Rings we do not see Viggo Mortenson on screen, we see Aragorn. In this film we just see a bunch of random actors in makeup. Not saying that there was no effort given, just that it did not work. 2nd: The plot. One problem with the theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven for Ridley was that he was forced to trim his film down to a manageable length which made the film confusing. With over two and a half hour running time you would think Ridley had more than enough time to flesh out Exodus and give it pacing and character development, but the film just felt like it was rushing along while at the same time taking too long to get to the point. Sigonie Weavers character showed up out of no where 1/3 way through the movie and was supposed to be someone important but it was never clearly established who she was. The same goes for several other characters in the movie. While everyone knows the tale of Moses, establishing, your main character is still an essential part of any film. In the far superior film The Price of Egypt, the opening scene shows us how Moses came to be brought up in the household of an Egyptian Pharaohs. In Exodus we are briefly told about Moses true origin in a boring dialogue scene with Ben Kingsley.....Show me Ridley. Do not tell me. One of the most basic rules of filmmaking... If I had not already know the story of Moses the revealing of his prophetic origin would have come out of no where. I could literally pick apart every scene in movie like this but I will not go into spoilers. This is a horrible and distasteful film that I would avoid seeing in the theaters.

Having Moses commit multiple murders is totally inaccurate. Also, a child god? Obviously Ridley Scott hasn't studied history or read the book of Exodus. Preparing an army to fight goes against Moses' faith in God. The Ten Commandments movie was overacted, but at least it had some semblance to what actually occurred based on historical documents. This movie obviously was made for the action scenes and thinks faith in God isn't possible. I wouldn't recommend wasting anytime watching this poor excuse of an account of Moses.

Christian Bale as Moses was an odd choice, given his recognizability. His star=power does not help the film. The effort to naturalize the story by de-mythologizing the characters and settings fails because the story really actually is a myth, at least in terms of what we are accustomed to experiencing in our own lives. Think for an instant how you would react to those special effects were they actually to occur. So, which to choose? Myth or history?

I would highly recommend this movie The special effects for the plagues and parting of the seas are wonderful. Christain Bale is great as Moses and Joel is a great Ramses.

537,cyanide-af,Naggers Nag!,7,6 December 2014,"This is the first time I write a review since I felt like I needed to. I reads lots of BS about this movie on how all the cast is white and why the story is not as it is the old testament, and acting is week and so on... Some people out there are pathetic! Visual effects were stunning, the story was cleared of religious BS as much as possible. They transformed Moses from an imaginary personality with a stick that turns into a dragon into a real and believable character. Battle scenes were epic and setting is pretty much impressive. The famous red sea scene was so impressive that many people in the theater just uttered word like wow or holy sh..., as an atheist I really enjoyed the story,SFX and especially lack of the usual BS that you would expect to see in these sort of films.And last but not the least Christian Bale rocked, don't fall for the film parasites AKA movie critics. They have to bash a good movie to get credit and praise garbage films to show how they are different, alas they are nothing but a bunch of elitist morons!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
538,jlzekk,A decent film for what it sets out to do,7,18 February 2019,"If you're looking for an enjoyable action/adventure/drama movie based on Exodus then this movie is worth a watch. I feel a lot of the low scores are unjust and must be because of other people's impossibly high expectations given what Exodus means to them or they wanted deep drama with character development (something the actual book was no good at either). I just read Exodus for the first time recently (I'm not religious) and decided to watch this movie. The movie follows the book quite closely with only a few minor changes which I felt actually made the story more believable and compelling. The boring parts of the story have all been kept out or displayed rather, in a manner that requires very little scene time but enough to pay homage to the original. Overall, the movie finds a decent balance between action, adventure and drama to tell its story but doesn't excel in any category. A slightly above average movie that is worth a watch but this movie doesn't bring anything exceptional to the table.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Not at all!,5,6 December 2014,"What was Ridley Scott thinking?..Give audience, a visually pleasant film and put Christian Bale as a lead and it will turn out to be epic?...well Christian Bale's performance was good (he has done much better movies) and that was it. How can you make a movie on Moses and disregard the accuracy of events that are already documented and are readily available (read the Quran and Bible)...Even Dreamworks did a pretty decent job portraying a far more accurate version of Moses in their animation movie 'Prince of Egypt'...The messenger of God, played by a kid was such a led down...extremely disastrous experiment...and at the end Rhamses survived the red sea?..oh come on Ridley!

I am a Ridley Scott fan but this movie, which should have been filled with awe, was simply awful. It should have been titled either ""An atheist's contempt for the Book of Exodus"" or ""A psychiatrist's analysis of the guilt driven, grandiose-delusions of a privileged Hebrew slave."" Give me a break!God is portrayed as a 13 year old boy, angry, unsettled and direction-less. Neither God nor Moses had a plan for freeing the slaves, so nobody seemed to be in charge. The 10 plagues (regarded by Christians, Jews and Muslims as miraculous), are portrayed as being the result of natural events (alligators started the whole process), as opposed to the power of God.The movie has two redeeming qualities: 1. CGI (pretty impressive), and 2. The depiction of the formal, respectful prelude to wedding-night intimacy between Moses and Zipporah.I still want my money back",Exodus - Gods and Kings

He was too freaking smart... Too good at Management and Marketing Both.. What he did is amazing... He managed To become a leader of the 400k Slaves! leading them for years.. wondering in deserts.. You can't pull that off without inventing a nice religion.. and Hell Yes! Moses Did it!So That's what I liked about the Movie... It portrayed the biblical version of course.. But you could see how smart Moses was... You could see him use ""word of God"" as he wished.. The character was terrific.. I also Liked the visuals and the portraying of the everyday life in Egypt..

542,shikhar_chauhan2009,"Although the climax was a bit disappointing, a brilliant movie in total!",1,18 January 2015,"Well, I am not the kind who writes things on the internet but when I watched this movie, I just had to do this. This movie captures the behaviour of a schizophrenic person so impeccably and shows the irrational disposition of society in such a beautiful manner that I had nothing but praise for it.To start with, the conversations that the protagonist has with an imaginary entity, just like that girl in paranormal activity, have been represented really well. But it was his ambition and bravery that captivated me. The fashion in which he is able to allure and form a retinue, who help him to exasperate the whole town is commendable, especially given the fact that they don't have a strategy to follow. Even more enchanting is the way in which he is able to convince an immensely huge group of people to leave the town with him and walk in the desert for an indefinite period of time.What should be noticed here is how thousands of people leave the town with him, where they had been well-settled as slaves, on a journey that apparently takes them nowhere. It depicts a very intrinsic feature of the human mind, that is irrationality. Instead of trying to convey the rightness of their belief to the rest of the community and overthrow the king, they decide to leave into an open desert. I was expecting that given the mood of the whole movie, the ending would be more precise, like showing the people repenting their decision and asking the protagonist to provide them with a plan, which he would have failed to do, and then they all become miserable, and a few of them survive and go back to where the come from.But regardless of it flaws, the movie has given us a lot to think over and I am sure that we all will find a lot to learn from it.

543,vividhkothari,What's up with Hollywood?,6,5 December 2014,"I have never written a review in IMDb. This is my first time. Why? Because the movie hasn't been released in USA yet, and I just watched in India. Seeing just 5 reviews, I wanted to give mine too.What's up with Hollywood? Other than spectacular visuals and 3-D, they don't seem to care enough about anything else. In Exodus, by the famed director Ridley Scott, he surpassed many elements in visual effects. I have never ever seen so detailed visuals of ancient buildings, slums of slaves, and huge ocean waves and what not. 3-D adds a lot of pleasure in viewing such effects.That's it! There is nothing more that I could appreciate. It feels very empty. No emotions at all. Acting by Christian Bale is quite alright, but it is nothing special. Some scenes are memorable. But the lack of good writing, script, and no contribution from other actors diminish the effect of Bale as well. It is hard to imagine the same guy directed Gladiator (I haven't seen Aliens and blade runner). But there is everything missing in Exodus that made Gladiator a hit.At many places, it is boring, even if the cinematography and visual effects are great. In the beginning, you would feel as if Ridley took you to the ancient Egyptian world, just because of the small details shown in the effects. However, any interest or so will end in next 10 minutes or so, when the story starts lacking.So, my question remains. What's up with Hollywood? Is this much technology and huge funding to such directors destroying the creativity. Why no body cares about character building and good script? At one level, it feels extremely sad that with this budget and this talent in technology, even a slight efforts and honesty towards script, story, and dialogue can take such movies to a masterpiece level. But...no! ""We are going to earn a lot of money. You are going to enjoy watching the magnificent sequence of millions of frog jumping in ancient buildings. Call it even?""

544,TonyRojas2000,Worst Ridley Scot Film ever,1,7 October 2015,"Not only a manipulated version of the Historic Bible facts but a bad way to tell any story. a film for the regular action, Hollywood trasher fan. Nothing to appreciate here of a filmography value. 2 hours wasted in telling nothing relevant, new!. I think the Jew's most rebel against themselves telling Hollywood that their religion is not a book of misinterpretations for creation new version like this and Noah. The things that teach us the Bible is for understanding God's mind through the holy spirit, not just tales of specific human fathers las Moses. God's as a kid? It was Jesus but he grew up. A God that kills kids? and then Moses just says "" No Hebrew baby was killed last night"" Leads more to enlarge the so bad called Anti Semitism that they seems to like to do another things. What's next, Adam and Eve homosexuals?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
545,Segarr,Terrible Schlock,3,9 December 2014,"I went into this film with an open mind. I have enjoyed Ridley Scott movies in the past, particularly Gladiator which is the same genre of film as this. Unfortunately, I was left feeling extremely disappointed. Although this is a classic, biblical story that most movie-goers are likely already familiar with, the film-makers have decided to pad this ancient tale with over-the-top action scenes, as well as one-note characters that feel more like cardboard cut-outs as opposed to actual human beings. The most shameful aspect of the film is the part that I was most looking forward to : The Actual Plague. While I was hoping to see harrowing images of Egypt being decimated in a genuinely frightening tale, we are instead bombarded with fake looking CGI that simply left me dry. The plague feels more like a computer montage than an actual scary event.Terrible script. Weak performances. An over-reliance on CGI instead of CHARACTERS and STORY! Overall, just a bad film. Didn't help that they chose big named actors instead of people that looked more like Ancient Egyptians. Pass.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This is the only movie of him that I didn't enjoy. He didn't impress me as Moses. And what to say about Ridley Scott!? I really had big expectations about this movie, but I'm totally disappointed. He tried to be some kind of Mel Gibson, but to ""tell"" a story on his own way, with few guides. My opinion is that this movie is waste of time and money. I rate it 4, cause on effects,creative art. Beside that...I really cant find any good reason to watch this movie. As I can see, reading reviews, I'm not only one with that opinion.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
547,swapp11,A realistic portrayal of a made up story.,7,21 December 2014,"Sure it is fun to imagine Moses with his staff parting the red sea and the winged angel of death slashing the throat of children, but is it realistic?This film makes the best out of a silly story. God punishes the Hebrews for leaving the land he gave them. Not by letting those that left suffer until death to then help release their children back to the promised land. Naw, he lets them suffer for 400 years. Then he decides to take action after a series of unlikely and unfortunate events(all Hebrew children killed one particular year, Moses ending up in the palace, cast out). Once Moses got it good. Well, Good makes him free the slaves. He does not pick someone back in Egypt. What a dick.God is portrayed as a child in the move, that makes sense. He acts like one. He gives poor and interpretative instructions to Moses and does not show up when needed. Moses does what he knows best, strategy and tactics, training soldiers and making it cost to much to keep the slaves(see the American Revolutionary War ), but suddenly Good gets inpatient.The Good we meet in the film has control over the elements and celestial objects, over life and death and can talk to people in their heads. He starts a series of plagues by increasing the water flow and sand in the Nile. When that does not work he moves on to extreme weather.-God could have handled this in any other way for a better result. Talk to the Pharaoh directly, hit the large statue outside he palace with 10 blasts of lightening, then threaten to kill his mother, wife and son then the Pharaoh. Repeat with new Pharaohs until desired result is gained.The point is that none of this happened. The Hebrews being slaves in Egypt can not be proved and by every archaeological dig it becomes more and more clear that the story is a far fetched tale. So the inpatient child Good does not show up to guide Moses once his people is released. Then he sends a meteor into the sea to create a tidal wave to draw of the water so the Hebrews can cross. If the Exodus story is to be slightly realistic in any way. The way it is done in this movie is the only way. In this aspect it's a pretty decent film.The prince of Egypt is a more magical story, and more fun to watch as a fantasy film. IN the same way that the fairy tale of Noah was fun to watch with the stone monsters and other ridiculousness.White washing? Yes. Would you get the budget with an all ethnic cast? Probably not, do you need the budget? well..?. It makes it weird though when the main cast is white and all extras are ethnic.

I liked the great visuals and the pace of the movie. Although the screenplay and the acting/character development was not as strong as it could have been. Also there were only two characters that the story explored making the first half a little tedious.I went to watch this movie with little to no expectations and I had already seen The Ten Commandments and The Prince of Egypt.

The problem I have with this film is the story line. The writers added to and subtracted from the original story in Exodus. Moses knew who he was and about the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. His mother was his care taker not his sister. Moses slew an Egyptian guard who was mistreating a Hebrew man not himself and it was after his brother Aaron advised him to leave that he fled. The timing is all off it was forty years after he fled Egypt the God spoke to Moses and he did not break his leg. God didn't show himself as a child. Moses did not train an army of Hebrews. Moses and Aaron spoke with Ramses after each plague. Where did the pillar of cloud by day and pillar of fire by night go?

553,robertrizkin,Flip or Flop,1,20 April 2015,"Hollywood has the opportunity with every year that passes of making a movie that is more powerful, more visually stunning, that will have more of an impact than they did the year before. In this case 55 years after the fact this movie should have been jaw dropping with people sitting on their seats. It was not. It was more like watching a drunk movie star accept a grammy, we appreciate the skill and effort put forward to be eligible for the reward but we wish that the actor had the restraint to not get drunk and make a fool of herself in front of the world and her fans.Something that needs to be understood from the start is that this movie in now way follows the Historical text of the bible. It contains some very loose arrangements of some of the events that occurred in the story of the Isrealites being freed from slavery, but then excludes a couple of the more spectacular ones that would have made this movie a rockstar hit. When Moses chases a couple of stray goats up the mountain and falls into a pit of mud The Lord appears to him in the form of a boy. Not once in any text does The Lord appear as a boy, show himself as a boy, portray himself as a boy. Moses also argues with The Lord when they have their random impromptu chat sessions and The Lord argues back and makes himself look as if he really isn't who he says he is, an all knowing, all powerful being.Hollywood often tries to make a movie shorter than it should be and / or not as long as it needed to be. With Exodus they should have gone longer. Much longer. The audience that watched this movie I would assume for the most part to be Christian in faith and already know the biblical version of this story. There were huge gaps in the storyline as the director assumes that his audience already knows what is happening in the story and skips over points that needed to be made for the story to make sense if the viewer were not Christian and had not read The Bible.Casting was amazing, there were a ton of amazing big name Hollywood actors. Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Ben Mendelsohn, Maria Valverde, Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Ewen Bremmer ... and the list goes on. If the director Ridley Scott had been able to harness the power of the story that he was trying to share and tap into the full talents of these actors this movie should have had me standing and clapping from my bedroom where i had rented it from a redbox instead of paying box office prices because of its meh par reviews. It did not. I was not. Its going back to redbox.Its sad that a movie with such potential in actors / director and the historical strength of the story flopped like a fat boy eating the last crumbs of his chocolate cupcake spilled all over the floor. The promise of excellence was just that, a promise and it has left us the audience wanting more but not in the good way.

559,vitorcampos,Be aware,3,26 December 2014,"Okay ... we all know (or should know) that the story of the escape of the Hebrews from Egypt is an absolute and completely fictional story. Using just one of the countless arguments that could: THERE WASN'T that kind of SLAVERY IN Egypt (See Mountains of the Pharaohs: The Untold Story of the Pyramid Builders, 2006 written by the most renowned Egyptologist currently and Head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt, Dr. Zahi Hawass)!Ridley Scott's film is based on this tale (of course) and, therefore, I was already hoping to find a strong distortion of the true history of Ancient Egypt. However I went just to have the opportunity to attend a beautiful and realistic reconstruction of the buildings, clothing etc etc etc. At this point, it was not a total disappointment. Although some details quite erroneous and unnecessary (as Ramses personally doing the Ritual of the Opening of the Mouth in his father's funeral, the fact that appears more than one Pyramid of Steps, a colossal statue of Ramses at Luxor - there were several in real history... I do not understand why put one that does not exist -; an ugly Nefertari - who understands a bit of Egypt understand that this is relevant -, in addition to several Egyptians with blue eyes and some other minor things).Someone might be reading this review and thinking, if he knew that the film would not be historically correct, why is he talking all this?I decided to write this because of a sacrilege that Hollywood did, in my opinion. In addition to the ridiculous performances (except for Christian Bale), the Bible already mischaracterizes Ramses II and Egypt enough, but for some reason this wasn't enough to Ridley Scott and his screenwriters. They have even directly ridicule the title ""Ramses the Great"" in a certain scene.Ramses II, the Great, considered by most historians as the greatest pharaoh of Egyptian history in various aspects (economic, administrative, cultural, diplomatic and military). The man who made the first peace treaty of humanity (Treaty of Qadesh). It was so different that, at a time when people lived on average 30 years, he passed away over 90, and his empire lasted 67 years.In the film he is a heartless asshole and a weak and ignoble Pharaoh feared but not respected and much less worshiped. To me it only remains to hope that all the people who watch this film not to be left with that image in their memories because, unlike, Ramses II should be remembered with respect and as one of the most important figures in the history of mankind.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Entertaining? Whatever the reasoning, it was faulty to say the least, it certainly didn't make the movie more interesting or compelling. In addition, the decision to have some bratty kid interact with Moses throughout the movie, presumably representing God, was a terrible one. I don't normally get annoyed by God in a movie but that was a continual emotion here! Frankly, the primitive special effects in The Ten Commandments, where God speaks to Moses from the burning bush, was both more Biblicallly accurate as well as dramatic and satisfying as a movie watcher.

It's important since hear in Brazil leftist movie makers are doing films where alternative religions actually ""work"", at the same time they mock of Christianity (Ernesto: O Político Honesto).Interesting point: Moses is an atheist!!! Well, at least in the beginning of the movie...There is a battle, in Kadesh, where Moses takes part. The interesting point, that took my attention, was a sutil scene where: a) Moses screams something; b) some soldier throws fire at a hut (that may be with someone inside), and c) they go away. It's important because it's very clear Moses WAS NOT the kind of man that'd have done that!!!There is not that part of the bible where Moses kills some state employee because he was to kill a Jew: I think it is to take this ""care about human lives"" that Moses had... The Moses of the movie wouldn't stop a murder: EVEN IF HE HAD A GUN, got it???Well, ONCE MORE, the movie turn away from bible showing a Moses that sees Jews being mistreated and going away without doing nothing!!! After all, Moses is known for not giving a s* about lives!!!Well, actually Moses only kills when some guards took him for a slave... He MURDERED in the biblical sense of the word... In our culture, people like that COULDN'T BE chosen by God...I mean: people shouldn't go around killing who took them for slaves, BY ACCIDENT!!!After exiled, Moses kills in self defense!!! I agree!!! I agree!!!At least, he is a HUNTER as well!!! Deal with it, leftists!!!I believe that something The Blaze didn't catch is that Moses get married in another religion ritual!!! Yes... There's nothing Jewish about it... And I guess the director tried to show some Muslim points in it (I KNOW MOHAMSHIT WAS BORN SOME 600 YEARS AFTER Christ!!!)... And in this marry, Moses says that it's his wife that is the most important thing in his life (not God!!!)...More than that: the God Moses sees is ""another people's God""!!!

I'll admit that I had really low expectations going into it but sometimes movies surprise me. But then the movie went way off course from the Bible story. The worst part of it was when they showed God being a little boy. Really?! Instead of God speaking through the burning bush to Moses, he is shown in the form of a little boy and he keeps popping up throughout the whole thing. He says ""I am"" like he is God but there is no conviction behind it and it was totally sacrilegious. And then I got to the part where the people were taking up arms against Pharaoh. They were literally sharpening swords and preparing to fight like they could take on Pharaoh's army. This happened instead of God sending the plagues and being the one in control. The whole thing was ridiculous. Just like with ""Noah,"" Hollywood ruined another great Bible story with a terrible movie. Sometimes it is okay to make changes to an original film to make it a new ""work of art"" but in this case it was completely wrong since it was about the Bible and besides it left out fundamental parts.

The director tries rather pathetically to convey the miracles as natural phenomenon. The parting of the sea was also nothing more than receding of water. You will come out of the theater rather flat and uninspired. The 1956 version is far superior to this debacle. The studio committee (script writers) must have foolishly thought most of the audiences would be atheists. You would have to possess at least some faith to watch these biblical stories in the first place. The God himself talk to Moses by imprinting Moses' own voices to his head. But this film depicts a middle person as an intermediary. Moses' brother Aaron (who had a major role in the Bible) was hardly mentioned in the film. The special effects were also nothing special.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
564,mutrahhotel,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (contains spoilers),1,31 December 2014,"I was so excited to see this movie. However, I felt I wasted my time and money on it. I do understand that Ridley Scott is Atheist, but if you are making a religious based movie, you should stick with the original religious texts and don't add your own logic to it. for example the major errors are: Moses never yelled when speaking to God, God did not appear in a form of an annoying kid, Moses had a staff or stick not a sword, Ramses was known for his strong character but in the movie he had a weak personality, Moses did not stand in the middle of the sea waiting for Ramses, he just crossed while Ramses drowned. Very awful story and directing! don't waste your money on it!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
565,tonywin64,A bland and missed opportunity to make a exciting and good movie.,5,28 December 2014,"I will start by saying I am not religious but when I see a story based on literature I expect a movie to convey the excitement of a story and the clash between two gods mentioned in Exodus what lets face it a rather interesting power struggle with exciting fantasy elements lends itself very well to make a decent lively movie.Thus I was hoping to see something on the lines of the 1956 movie The Ten Commandments, but instead it was a disappointing movie that missed simple things that could have added to the impact of the movie such as the interaction between Pharaoh, Moses and Aaron, also the majority of the plagues where far too rushed and well as for the Red Sea scene well that was based on scientific theories rather than the account as mentioned in the bible which was far more interesting.I really think that Ridley Scott has made a bland, uninspiring movie and that he missed an opportunity to make a great movie rather then an average movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Where is Moses staff?? and God is a snotty nosed little boy!!! Absolute insult!!! do not waste nearly 3 hrs of your life.. Terrible film.. Ridley Scott you should be ashamed of yourself! The plagues have no oomph to them.. It was the work of God so should look like it. And where does it say that when the red sea was parted Moses didn't make it across and ends up being washed away for a dramatic swim???

I did not even finish watching it because it just belittles our Almighty God in so many ways. Just because you don't believe what the bible says doesn't mean you have to make up your own ""logical"" theory on how things may of occurred. God makes it very clear about the burning bush, He makes it very clear on the plagues, the sea turning to blood and just how He instructed Moses to handle those situations and it was ALL left out!!! God warns us about adding to and taking away from His Word. Just sick that someone would distort the Word of God in this manner. It gives those who don't know the Word of God an unrealistic depiction of God's Word. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

568,wahabd92,Please read this review before seeing the film,1,2 January 2015,"First and foremost this movie does not deserve the extreme generosity of getting a 1 out of 10, but I am forced to select this option as this is the lowest rating available. I normally do not write reviews as most people generally cover the good and bad things there are about films, but I feel compelled to share my opinion of this movie to the public. I will review this from two points of view, that of a religious person, and of the non-religious movie-goer who's seeing this for a good movie experience and is a fan of the ""epic"" genre.From a religious point of view, and I speak of this as a Muslim (although all Abrahamic religions have a somewhat similar story), the story was completely deviated from, and a modern interpretation was adapted (that was also used in the movie Noah), which is a deviation from the true message the Prophet Moses had as a messenger of God, to worship the one true God only, and turn it into a political message with absolutely no emphasis on religion whatsoever, skipping essential parts of Moses and the miracles he had to show Ramses that he was truly a messenger of God, the use of which would have been translated beautifully as a movie scene, while inexplicably misusing other miracles out of context of the original message. What did the movie ""Moses"" want from Ramses? He surely didn't want him to believe in God. Another grossly underemphasised point was the sheer evil and arrogance of Ramses, who is considered the most arrogant human being in history and the worst dictator to ever live (he declares himself a god). Instead he is portrayed as an average typical dictator who at some point in the movie you actually sympathize with, in contrast to how he should've been developed as a character who'd make Joffrey Baratheon and Adolf Hitler look like saints.The character of Moses was also inexplicably meddled with,, he is portrayed as an antihero, and essentially passive to the progression of the plot (All events that happened could've happened without him in this film). None of the aspects of his true personality were shown, he was depicted as a bystander who happened to be a former Prince of Egypt which somehow gave him the right to lead the Israelite's. He's also white and British for some reason, and also has excellent public speaking skills (a trait his brother Aaron had, whereas Moses suffered from stuttering). Moses was one of the most humble servants of God, yet he is shown to have adapted the pride of the Egyptians, and develop this rude personality. Aaron isn't shown in the film as a prophet, he was basically an extra and was there for completion's sake only.What I also didn't like was how everything had to be explained with at least some pseudoscience ""for it to make sense to the 21st century viewer and so the story doesn't look ridiculous"", well this interpretation is utterly ridiculous. What the writers fail to see is that most viewers actually believe in the original story, and those who don't are open minded enough to see a movie which they may consider fictional and enjoy. So really there's no satisfying anyone with this pseudoscientific politically driven modern interpretation which fails to deliver.The film contains unnecessary blasphemy which I don't even have the stomach to describe, it was really painful to watch and had me cringing throughout.For non-religious viewers: The film is CGI heavy, doesn't get you involved emotionally, a huge waste of acting talent, mediocre script, drags for too long. If you're interested in a good story I suggest you read the source material instead of wasting 2 and a half hours on this. It fails as a movie as much as it does with it's story.If you're expecting to see ""epic"" scenes which you know from the source story such as the splitting in half of the sea, even that part is meddled with, and they decided to make it ""explainable"" by involving tides and storms instead to appeal to the ""intellectual 21st century viewer"". This is utterly absurd. With modern filming technology a visual masterpiece could have been made, especially for that final scene. So it really is a shame to see all that acting, money, and really inspiring story go to waste.One last thing, this interpretation deliberately fails to include the most essential aspect of the story, the drowning of Ramses II. In the original story, after all his arrogance and all the proof that Moses and Aaron had, and after his continuous refusal to believe in God, he finally does acknowledge his belief as he is drowning, but it is too late to repent by then. Instead, in the film, he does not drown, and he simply walks away while all those who were with him died.To summarize:From a movie-goer's point of view: An absolutely pointless film, one does not enjoy a good story, nor good expected special effects. From a religious/historical point of view: This movie is an insult to anyone who believes in the true story, and is no where near close enough to what actually happened.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

But movie itself is really entertaining and that's what matters not some fictional or maybe close to truth story that for some reason offends this really well educated people, who know exactly what happened to Moses and hebrews.I really liked this movie, well there's lot of CGI but not out of place.Acting is good, could've been better but definitely not bad.. Story telling is decent..Portrayal of god is not clichéd and that was really great, for some people if god's in the movie, it should talk from clouds or something with deep voice..well it was not great choice but acceptable..Pharaoh was IMO best thing of this movie, he was well developed, with mixed feelings and questioning decisions, not like some menacing or diabolic guy who kills just because he's evil. No everything is in place for this character.Overall movie is watchable, entertaining, interesting..

I shake my head in disbelief that anybody would even release a movie this awful. Why is Hollywood releasing these kinds of movies in the first place? I started to fall asleep early on in this terrible movie and had to walk out. I'm sure the director and every actor was paid millions of dollars for whatever this movie was about. I will never support a movie in theaters again especially after this one. It's very disappointing. It's not even worth renting the DVD.

According to the Book of Exodus in the Bible, the staff used by Moses was by his side throughout important milestones.The staff was used to produce water from a rock, was transformed into a snake and back, and was used at the parting of the Red Sea. **Ridley Scott never shows a STAFF like that**I can only give 1 Star for this movie.

Pfff, masterpiece.But...Acting is not on a level expected for this kind of Hollywood stars. You can see that there is huge urge to spend a lot of money in movie, but you can also see that there is no adequate reason for doing so. Bale looks tired of acting, and someone should tell him that the Batman voice is for Batman. And here he is Moses. Joel was better. But just that - better.

If you are Jewish, Christian, Catholic, or have any respect of the beliefs of others at all, you should not see this movie. I hope any other directors or screenwriters considering Biblical texts for their films will realize they are portraying stories that are sacred to hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is a shame to see Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors and the man behind Alien and Gladiator, make this terrible film. It is a shame to see Christian Bale, Sigorney Weaver, and Ben Kingsley, some of my favorite actors, involved in such a terrible film.

First, Ancient Egyptians were not Europeans but Africans as their practices, murals, customs and beliefs are African. Depicting Ancient Egypt as European when the African Egyptians called them Typhonians or People of Seth because of their love of violence and destruction wrecked havoc on their societies for thousands of years. I suggest if you are a history buff please do not purchase a ticket for this movie.

You cannot believe the costumes, you cannot believe the facial hair or strange haircuts that are never paralleled in Ancienct Egyptian scriptures or drawings. Let alone the twisting of history and the unnecessary changes to the Biblical scripture upon which the story is based. I have no idea why God is played by a child, making it impossible to really believe he is the one behind those plagues.

I also had a laugh looking at those poor reviews from religious fanatics that the movie is not an accurate interpretation of biblical events:) funny stuff, who can give you an accurate interpretation of a fairy tale, you people are just pathetic:) All in all a good movie, I've watched it in 3D, some nice effects but nothing special.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

579,gstuartcox-720-639908,A Masterpiece for the Ages,10,14 December 2014,"I was wary about seeing it because the critics hate it 3 to 1 (saying it looked like ""pure product... without vision""), and audiences almost 2 to 1 (""heavy-handed.... slap in the face""); and Scott has a checkered past in my book (Prometheus); but it's an astonishing achievement; more than meets the eye. I love all films that create that 'time machine' feeling of really being there. I've studied ancient Egypt for fifty years, and have been to tombs and temples. This a very real film. So why are many rejecting it? The discrepancy is based largely on the fact that most viewers are Bible-illiterate these days, and have no idea what ancient life and people were really like. Fact is, the real Exodus story is ""heavy-handed"" and a ""slap in the face"" if you're a worshiper of power, a lover of wealth, and can't stand ""judgments"".Exodus is long and difficult to watch at times, but is a genuine and powerful drama - as life often is. Scott pulls out every stop, and creates an almost shockingly realistic and soul-wrenching psychodrama. Nobody in it is wooden or uninvolved, and the cast is masterful and engaging. Christian Bale is at his best, along with Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, and a cast of new actors who look like they stepped out of the ancient world already formed. More than 15,000 people were involved in the production. It's the perfect film for our age in that the core issue facing us right now is exactly the same core issue dealt with in Exodus: Power over Truth. Which will win? Do men with power define truth or does God? I can hear some of you saying that's the core issue of the whole Bible, and you're right.Pharaoh Rameses never would give up, nor would his armies, even after the ten plagues that were so horrible they almost defy description. In the same way our modern Ruling Class will NEVER give up. They prove it again and again as our modern plagues have no effect. We must - somehow - escape from their malevolent influence. Like the Egyptians, they're doomed to suffer in their hell forever, and we can't let them drag us down with them. How can we escape from this psychic Egypt?

Why is that, that Ridley is having this spectacular production, charismatic actors, wonderful costumes and scenery and ends up completely telling nothing when you leave the cinema? Well i could say its the fault of the script and mostly the editing. There are huge chunks missing from the movie, important points, there is no drama, because everything seems seriously rushed. We get to know basically nothing about the relationship of Ramses and Moses, which should have been one of the core of the story. They are just painted there, but there is no heart even if the actors do what they can. Ridley must love Gladiator a lot, he quotes exact sentences from it, angles, shots. But Gladiator had a heart. There are some flashes of good moments - the opening battle for example,The Red Sea part, some look in the eyes of the characters, but those are not lasting for long because there is no weight, no emotion. I can tell the exact same about the score as well. The ambition is to respect but half of the movie ended up on the editing room probably.

Now I am a huge Sir Ridley Scott fan, having being a big fan of Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, even Prometheus. Lets's start with Acting. Now I've seen a lot of stupid complaints about their being a dominantly white cast in a movie that takes place in Egypt. Aside from that bullshit, Christian Bale gives a great performance as Moses. Playing a character that is conflicted between his faith in god, family, and his followers. And Bale blends all of that together beautifully. You can feel him struggle trying to do whats best for everyone. The other role of Ramesses, played by Joel Edgerton is sort of plain. The one thing he does well is showing how cruel Ramesses can be. Aside from that their isn't much else to him.Next is visuals Scott does this beautifully every time it calls for it. Seeing Egypt being built was amazing to see as well as the fighting sequences. Not much else to say but A+ for scale/visual. The Pacing/Plot of this movie is the weakest part. The opening act does a pretty good job of engaging you in the movie, about mid way through it does drag a lot, but towards the end it does pick up and brings you back in. Overall this movie has good acting, thrives in visuals, and lacks in pacing. I give it a B-.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

The whole movie is a big lie on Allah -The one God-, prophet Moses -peace be upon him- and the history. I don't know how this movie went on cinemas. It is aggressive to all religions. Also how do you dare to represent God as a child. And how god is so aggressive to kill children and to torture an entire nation. It is ridiculous.

It is based on a story that has no historical evidence. That leaves the story open to interpretation.Christian Bale was excellent as always. My only gripe with the film was the odd changes to the plagues and supernatural events. If you are going to make a film about a fictional event then there is little point in trying to make the supernatural events more believable. Just part the sea, it would have made this version of Moses more interesting to see the superhuman side rather than a simple messenger.As someone who does not believe in god and finds religion silly, it was still a very entertaining movie.

I can definitely see that 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is not Ridley Scott's best film, however it does offer a fresh and commendable perspective upon this well known biblical event. From the get go, Scott grasps and transports you to an Ancient Egyptian world so incredibly monumental, that it is hard to believe it even existed.Throughout the entirety of the movie the cinematography is flawless. The visual effects are the quintessence of Hollywood's technology today. The costuming and props are admirable. The acting is simply fine, I mean Christian Bale doesn't deliver the strongest performance of his career, but he is certainly deserving of recognition. The music is intense and captivating and lastly the historical and biblical accuracy is well, as accurate as it needs to be.Don't get me wrong, as I said before, it is not Scott's best film. There are a few given problems. For example: the casting is unquestionably controversial, the pacing is poor at times and the story does lack a bit of detail in emotion and general depth.But does all this make this film pathetic and terrible?

In the Bible, up until crossing the Red Sea, Miriam's only ""role"" was to watch Pharoh's daughter rescue Moshe and arrange for Yocheved, Moshe's mother, to nurse him. She assumes a more active role only after crossing the Red Sea. Aaron should definitely have been given a big role. In addition to the above glaring omission, there are lots of anachronisms in the movie. The churning Red Sea scenes are unrealistic and the costumes of the Egyptian warriors are from a a different era.

What a Magnificent movie you have created, so much so that I will be back tomorrow to see the SPECTACLE again, but this time on VMAX. The action in the first 10 minutes, is worth the ticket alone. And the CHARIOT rides are so much fun. I always have had a yearning to experience Egypt the way it was in all of its glory, and you have certainly captured the essence as it must have been. The Temple of Karnack, still the largest ever built by man looks fabulous in 3D. The sets, locations, costumes are so VIVID, that I wish I were there now to see it for real. But to the story of Moses, it is very realistic and true to the story that I have known, but even more so. Of course you have made a literal interpretation, but the God boy called ""I AM"" is a refreshing idea. From my interpretation ""I AM"" is equivalent to ""AMEN"". All in all... ALL GOOD",Exodus - Gods and Kings

To me it is an empty film, despite the grandiose Scenography and special effects.There is not one event that has the depth and meaning that relates with the old Testament, not from the religious point of view, but what this mean to the Jewish people: the exit from Egipt under the guidance of their prophet Moses and his brother Aaron, to receive God's Law, and seal the pact between God and the Jewish People. It is a distorted story that does not mean anything, and may be confusing for people who are not familiar with the Old Testament.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This better improve"" and as the movie continued to get worse by the minute i began to wish i was home doing laundry or cleaning old drawers- anything but this boring nonsense. I couldn't get into it, Firstly because I kept going ""wow- thats a stretch. Did the writer even read the Bible or even a chapter in Exodus??"" Ridleys story is a tall tale, not even close to being an ""accurate"" interpretation if you could even call it an ""interpretation"". There seems to be an underlying pc/Democrat agenda- again boring.I knew from the previews of Zipporah (whos supposed to have dark skin and doesn't) that the film was going to be off, but this far off!?!? They cast is hard to watch, not only for their uninspiring acting (i kept thinking of blue avatars after seeing S. Weaver), but they're ethnically challenged so to speak- i saw white Americans and Britains with 2013 hair in really ornate Egyptian looking modern costumes. It was like watching a cheap play except there was No culture, no life, nothing to draw you in and only popcorn to keep you- if your lucky. God was not the focal point at all, and newsflash God is Always supposed to be the protagonist in ""His"" stories. Ridlwy either didn't get or ignored that memo. Prince of Egypt, the cartoon was way better than this defamation. This didn't discuss God's loving character, or His consistent presence, His foresight or preparation or any of the attributes that makes God God. This movie puts the ultimate God in a man made boring unbaffling box, even the miraculous plague s were stifled. If Ridley doesn't believe in God and cant give Him the honor He deserves then he really has no business making a movie about Him. It lacked heart. Emotion. Anything worthy of note. Even if he doesn't believe it, respect it. Like Noah, I would not nor could not recommend such a ""blashemic"" movie -as prince of egypts hotep and huy would put it. Read the Book, its way better, naturally accurate. And wont take up nearly as much time as this long stupid movie took to get through-seriously is it over yet?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
596,sagarika-ravulapati,"Exodus retold, an Epic's epic failure",1,11 December 2014,"First, I have a question about the title itself, the movie clearly claims to be based out of the bible. So, who are the Gods here, isn't it one God who brought His people out of Egypt which the movie boasts about also? Has the director taken the words of Pharaoh too seriously when he says I am God? Let alone the title,as I walked into the theater late, I only saw Christian Bale saving some kingly dressed Egyptian. And the next thing I see the Egyptian man calls him Moses. Where is this coming from? Sure, Moses lived in the palace raised by the Pharaoh's daughter but when did he save Pharaoh's son in the war? Moses, the author of Exodus himself would have remembered to give himself that credit if he did that, wouldn't he? Well, the director tries to make a point about the 'valiant' Moses, But later you find it is little too much exaggeration of thought to give screen time of around 20 minutes to the whole act of Moses discovering about his nationality, when Bible just conveys that he already knew he is a Hebrew.Absolutely ridiculous thing is to use Ben Kingsley as Nun, who is the father of Joshua for the dramatic effect of letting the cat out of the bag that Moses is a Hebrew. All this successfully blurs the actual details of the character of Moses through the way he was raised. Truth about his nationality and race helped him choose the side and kill the Egyptian in the first instance he saw his people troubled. That is what truth does; it will aid you in judgment. The most disappointing scene in the movie has not yet come until you see a bush burning and a small boy saying that he is the I AM. I was looking forward to this entire dialog between God and Moses but apparently this Moses was sinking in mud hit by stones and he wakes up getting convinced by his wife that it is all in his head. Yeah, as this Moses doesn't go with a staff on to this mountain like the one guarding the sheep, also misses God's instruction to use staff to work wonders to convince his people. I know, now we just wait for him to get back to Egypt and set things in action, meet Aaron and negotiate with Pharaoh regarding the release of his people. But you will be shocked that this Moses is neither the one who stammers with tongue nor with his sword. He secretly ambushes Pharaoh in his palace and threatens him in the name of God.For whatever reasons, Moses here trains an army of handful of Israelite men the basics of archery, for what? to take down the entire Egyptian army? I doubt that! To deal with this adamant Moses, God says I will do my business, you can stop fighting, only to dampen the Moses's mighty spirit to save his own people. I can't believe they showed the plagues to have had fueled from the river full of crazy crocodiles eating 10 men!! Whatever the director thought of the original story of Aaron using his staff on the river to change it into blood, he came up with this idiotic picture in his head. And all the other plagues are the effect of this blood plague! Clearly there was no effort made while narrating this story to convey that Hebrew people are not being affected by the plagues. On top of it, Moses is telling God to fall in line with the story by saying that everyone is getting affected by these bloody plagues can you like stop? Thanks to the disobedient Moses, it helped the director not convey God's repeated messages to Pharaoh, warning him to leave Israelites from his country. Good God! Somehow, Moses cryptically warns Pharaoh that his son might die that night if he wouldn't let his people out of country by night. I couldn't stop wondering if it not for the actual Pharaoh, this Pharaoh would have listened if Moses just spoke the words as absolute God's word.By now, we should know what to expect from this Moses, but I was totally unmoved by his concern for lambs over the preparation for Passover. We see that the movie might end soon when Hebrew people start to leave Egypt with anticipation about the great Red sea scene. Another disappointment greets us there as well, no amount of joy is shown on the faces of people who have been slaves for 400 years once they got freedom, I am sure the director very well knows how America celebrates 4th of July! I think I need to let go of some more failures of Moses here and just come to the end, yeah there is no parting of the red sea! You will be aghast to discover the reason for water to recede, Moses flinging his sword into the water! Moses has absolutely no clue where he is going, no God to talk to him. Pharaoh hasn't lost the lead, follows him soon. Given the confused emotions of Moses about his love for his Pharaoh Brother putting him in turmoil, fighting his own personal battles he waits and waits to be drowned in the flood. Oh no, they didn't kill him and our hero comes out of the sea to the side where Hebrews are waiting. Now, who led who exactly! Sigh!!The onward journey began, and there comes the Mt Sinai, God called Moses to write 10 commandments, the futility of the movie became crystal clear as God serves him tea and asks him to write a commandment if he agrees on the validity of that particular command. In conclusion, it's a story told but the truth left untold!",Exodus - Gods and Kings

That said as I settled down, I was disappointed within the first 5 minutes, because it showed Rameses and Moses as grown ups and the plot for me ran downhill from there. If you are going to run a 2hr plus movie why leave out, what I think are the important bits? Fromt he looks of things Hollywood believe that people no longer read bibles so they can just make it up as they go along...WRONG. There was no Moses basket in the Nile, no beautiful actresses looking Egyptian at all to play Nefeteri! You got Sigourney Weaver like she's about to pop a semi automatic for Alien, Joel Edgerton looked like a very sundried prune as Rameses not a handsome fellow for that role. I mean the whole cast did nothing for me, the only person that was good but looked bored was Bloody Hell Ben Kingsley..No Ridley you messed this one up big time. This is why Hollywood will always get a blasting from Muslim countries because they don't take religion seriously. You cannot just change the story and make it up as you go along, you got CB dressed up like some Roman Centurion, you got him finding out he's a Hebrew by I don't know idle gossip? by this time I was getting ready to leave and couldn't give a ounce as I'd lost interest.

While the stage and effects were cool, as they are in most films these days, it was, much to my expectation, inaccurate, showy, and just plain sad. The only reason why I watched it past the 10 minute mark was cause Christian Bale is in it and the Ramses guy was hot. Other than that, this movie was a huge disappointment and confirmed my decision to never again watch a movie based on an amazing true biblical story. But then again, that's just my opinion.

There may be a spoiler in this, but they tried to do this Bible story, while eliminating God...totally explaining away all the plagues as just natural events..so much of the Bible is left out changing many of it to fit in with a humanistic religion inserted.

Very good, good actors, good visuals! The reason why I gave the film a 9 and not a 10, is the way Moses is portrayed. In the Bible he fears God, however in the film he does not fear God, instead bargains with him and disagreeing at some points. Overall an amazing film in which I thoroughly enjoyed!

602,perrinepullicino,"All in all, a very good entertainment",10,31 December 2014,"What is wrong with you people those days ? I'm quite shocked when I read most of the reviews about this movie.Just for the record : reviewing a movie shouldn't be about comparing it to a book (read the book a second time if you are so happy with it, there's nothing wrong with that), or about your wishes for a cast that fits your preconceived ideas. It's about judging as fairly as possible the quality of something that has been brought to you, then add your own opinion and that's it.Let's begin with the beginning : The film is gorgeous. I found Avatar very very good looking (its one redeeming quality), and I found Exodus even better looking. Maybe because I found it more believable. I don't really know but I can only say that the visual team is one of the best out there. Truly stunning. (I watched this on the IMAX 3D in London, it was just perfect, a delight for the eyes).The cast, one of the main point of displeasure for people out there apparently, wasn't perfect, but certainly not as bad as those same people think or want to think. Bale was convincing enough, and I found him attractive enough to believe he could unite and lead 600,000 slaves to cross the sea. The same cannot be said for the guy playing Ramses. I didn't have any problem with him NOT being black (truly guys, who cares ? You know what Ramses looked like ? Good for you.) It's not about accuracy, it's about being able to carry the character, and that was not as good as it could have been. Perhaps my biggest disappointment of the whole movie. I don't believe it to be because of the actor himself, just that he didn't have an occasion to truly ""shine"", to build something with his character. In all honesty, I found him good during the first half of the story. The other half, he was a little too plain for me. Too bad. The rest of the cast, even if girl-lacking, but that's to be expected if you consider the era, was good. Not brilliant but good. Perhaps the lack of one or two other big, engaging characters could bother some. It did not bother me but I could understand. To be very honest, I believe the story to be more important here than the characters playing it. It's universal. The story in itself is freely adapted from the book(s), and YES, that's for the best (!). Come on, who cares if Moses did have a staff or not, if he was 80 or 40, or even if (Yes, I'll say it) he opened the sea or not. The story is about freedom, the quest to achieve it, and the relationship between God and the Hebrews. I find it way more convincing that the sea doesn't open up, but instead create a little (not so little at all might I add) tsunami than the usual by-the-book scene where Moses raises his staff etc... The story is made in such a way for an audience to appreciate it during 2 hours and a half, so some things are left apart and that, again, is to be expected. It is a movie after all, the book is something else, you just have to accept another way of telling a story. I just wish there was one more big scene between Ramses and Moses, or perhaps two. Just to see them interact a bit more.The question of God being played by a little boy is more interesting, in my humble opinion. It's a bold move, one that has already banished the movie from some countries, and maybe it could have been dealt with better. I still liked the idea. The first scene with the boy is not the most convincing one, I truly preferred his acting during and after the pleas. There is something singular and quite well pictured about God being portrayed by such a young boy, as if He was crushing ants without even thinking about it, and at the same time being able to feel very close to the people He loves. It was interesting, I cannot say more, that is a personal feeling I guess.To wrap it up, I found the entertainment proposed quite good. It was stunning, epic when it needed to be, perhaps a little too bland at times but nothing outrageous. Those who want something to watch to forget the weather outside or even simply to enjoy themselves with an honest movie, go ahead, you shouldn't be disappointed. No it's not Gladiator, but it could very well have been with a proper villain, and that is no reason not to watch the movie for itself, for it gives you pretty much everything a Hollywood production should give you. I never asked for more.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
603,tbado-107-181333,A Total Flop,1,23 December 2014,"Scott should stick to sci-fi it's clearly his forte. His attempt at making a biblically based movie was a complete mess to say the least. Cecil B Demille's ""The Ten Commandments"" so blows this film out of the water in every category from the script to the casting it makes Scott look like an amateur out of film school with some CG technology to help him along. Christian Bale was no Moses, he acted like he was a sidenote as he sat to the side on the beach next to the people after the Red Sea scene. Charlton Heston had presence and exuded leadership and manliness playing the same role. There is absolutely no comparison. The same applies for the Rameses role, Yul Brynner is how you play a Pharoah, Edgerton just acted like a punk that you can find anywhere. Neither of these modern lead actors projected any sort of presence in their roles that the earlier actors did. And then there was the depiction of God as some petulant boy. Really? One more huge insult/miss of the biblical text. Why don't you just call this drek ""Exodus: SouthPark version""? It was so bad you could barely mine any comedy out of it. There is so much ""artistic license"" taken with this film it has no form or function except maybe to mock Christian and Jewish beliefs. With all the modern day technology at his disposal Scott could've easily made and epic along the lines of the ""The Ten Commandments"", the script and film was already there, just get the right cast and do a modern remake but noooo had to try something ""different"" ie... make a total flop. What a waste of a film budget etc... There is so much more to be said about this pathetic excuse for a film, but what's the point? The film had none.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Not only he miserably fails to take advantage of the acting talent of Christian Bale but he even fails to properly layout the Epic story of Moses & Ramases. He had totally skipped the important details of the story and just concentrated on Visuals. I just want the readers to not waste their time on this movie just because it has Christian Bale in it....

The burning bush scene was just plain weird, and totally different than what actually happened. God is portrayed as a little boy, and there is very little actual dialogue from scripture in that scene. It was mostly made up. Ridley Scott took what actually happened and took out things he thought wouldn't be good and replaced it with things he thought would be better. Excuse me, The Bible is very clear what happened. Can you imagine if he did a movie about the Quran, and changed things the same way! Muslims would be so angry there would be terror attacks. God's word is Holy. Thats not all through out the movie, where was Moses' staff for crying out loud!!! In the movie before Moses leaves to go back to Egypt he gives his staff to his son!!! So Instead he had a sword!! Then all the miracles where all explained by natural causes. For example the parting of the Red Sea. It says clearly in scripture that the water was parted in two halves. It says that water was as a wall on the left and right sides. A miracle is a miracle because you can not explain it, it breaks the laws of physics. For God there is no laws of physics. To finish it off, at the end it shows Moses going up to get the Ten Commandments from God. It says in Scripture that God wrote this with his finger. Instead Moses writes it himself and God the boy child stands an talks to Moses. This is not right what so ever!!! The end result...I do not like this movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Forgive my hard criticism but we are talking about a guy who has directed awesome movies in the past. Well, there' you go. ""In the past"". I had hoped that the guy who has filmed Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator and American Gangster was quite able to do a movie about Moses. Well,.. he was not.

The grand shots with seamless CGI are the best visual recreation to date of the sheer magnitude of the exodus. Scott artfully brings to life an ancient world that is beautiful to watch. Unfortunately good looks, great actors and a big budget don't equate to a great movie in this case. Christian Bale and the entire cast's excellent performances were overshadowed by the poor casting choices to hire them.

What I don't get is that the whole story is laid out in the bible, all he had to do was follow it and it would have been epic. I understand when a director embellishes the story to make it better for the audience, more exciting more action etc. But if Ridley had read the story from the bible he would have found out it was WAY more epic then his movie. So many scenes that he left out that showed the immense power of God! And Also he kinda makes you angry at God in this movie and really makes God out to be a bit of a jerk. Not to mention making the plagues just seem like a random act of nature instead of the divine intervention from God and skipping several KEY biblical story points.

Moses had more than one wife in reality, but Sarah didn't get a look in in the movie. The Pharaoh character was weak, and the distortion of Moses' relationship with God was idiotic - making God out to be an unwise brat.

That's why I implore all brehs and brehettes to boycott this film and do not patronize or support this bigot director.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
618,nncardon8,There was nothing uplifting or edifying about this film.,2,12 December 2014,"We went to see the new movie Exodus at a theater here in Spain on Monday. When we came out, I was very angry. I was so upset by the treatment given in the movie of the Exodus from Egypt by the Children of Israel that I wanted to set up a protest right there. I wonder if there is any way to protest this movie in time to boycott it so the producers don't get so much money from it. These are my observations:1. God was left out of it. He was represented as an emotionless young boy. This made Him seem to be less powerful than Moses, and certainly not omniscient omnipotent or omnipresent.. 2. Moses, although handsome and a good actor, was not represented as a man with a prophetic calling. 3. No words were spoken by God to Moses. In the Bible, God speaks to Moses. Moses was not even told to take off his shoes because he was on holy ground. 4. Moses did not have a rod like the Bible says. He had an Egyptian sword instead. 5. The Red sea was not parted by the rod at God's command. Moses throws his Egyptian sword into the water and the water, for some unknown reason, slowly sinks down around it. 6. In the movie, the Children of Israel do not walk across on dry ground, as it says they do in the book of Exodus. They are up to their waist in water. It is made to look like God couldn't quite make the water stand up and he doesn't care if the small children get drowned. 7. The Bible says God puts a cloud and a pillar of fire between the Israelites and the Egyptians so they can all get across. None of this is in the movie.. 8. Aaron doesn't go with Moses to talk with the Pharaoh. In fact, Aaron, the spokesman, doesn't say anything to the Pharaoh. 9. Moses doesn't talk to Pharaoh much, or warn him about the plagues, either, which he does in the Bible. 10. In the movie, Moses leaves his family behind in Midian. In the real Book of Exodus, he takes them with him. 11. Never once does Moses tell pharaoh to let his people go. Why leave that out??? That really makes me mad. 12. Never once does God speak and say who He is. The young boy who is supposed to represent Him doesn't even have a kind or holy look about him. He just stands there. This is an insult to God. 13.When Moses goes up on Sinai to get the tablets with the Ten Commandments, the finger of God doesn't write them. Moses himself chisels them out on the stone tablets while The young boy sits down and watches. WRONG!! 14. Not once is it mentioned that there are Ten Commandments of God on the stone tablets. 15. We don't have any idea what the commandments are, even after watching the entire movie. 16. Moses does not turn the Nile to blood in front of Pharaoh. Some big crocodiles bite each other (all portrayed sensationalistically in 3 D) and that is what supposedly turns the Nile to blood.We are left with no feeling of peace or closure. The main chances for spectacular special effects have run dry, so the story must end.There was nothing uplifting or edifying about this film. Maybe the title of the film made my expectations too high. Why should film producers choose a Biblical account and then desecrate it? Why not be accurate and then let the audience have an opportunity to know the real story? They should do special effects on some other genre of story. One can see that the object of the movie was to sell special effects. Its side effect (intended or unintended?) is to give the audience the idea that God is weak and that Moses was only an unholy bystander. I am angry that we spent 11 euros (about 15 dollars) to be insulted and offended. I hope people will think twice before spending good money to reward the folks who concocted that spiritless travesty.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
619,tuttlm27,Strong Review,1,11 December 2014,This is one of the most historically inaccurate films in the history of cinema.Where do I start? Not only was the film filled with horrible direction and acting (minus a few scenes with C B).Overall the film was impassioned.I was generous by giving it 1 star; although zero wasn't an option.With this type of budget - they could have created a more accurate film with better directing.I hope that next time a Hollywood movie is made about religious or historical events they at least make the minimum effort to create something worthy of even being viewed.,Exodus - Gods and Kings
620,lil-reaper,Terrible movie,3,11 December 2014,"The Hollywood whitewashing of black history has to stop. People constantly argue that the Egyptians are not black, they are middle eastern, well that is a very weak argument because the middle easterners who are Egypt were never indigenous to Egypt. Similar to how the white people in South Africa are not indigenous to SA. Many writers and philosophers who traveled to Egypt prior to the sphinx being vandalized have noted that the features of the sphinx matched the people of Egypt who were black.Vivant Denon says this in his journal after going to Egypt and seeing the Sphinx before Napolean damaged it. ""...Though its proportions are colossal, the outline is pure and graceful; the expression of the head is mild, gracious, and tranquil; the character is African, but the mouth, and lips of which are thick, has a softness and delicacy of execution truly admirable; it seems real life and flesh. Art must have been at a high pitch when this monument was executed;...""Greek writer Herodotus also said that the sphinx had black features. ""The People Of Colchis Must Be Egyptians Because Like Them They Are Black-skinned And Wooly-haired."" Why are people LYING and saying that Egypt was anything but black? Even Aristotle (Greek philosopher) writes in the 4th century B.C. in Physiognomonica that the ""Egyptians and Ethiopians were very black."" I bet you the people claiming Egypt is non-black would have a hard time arguing that.""Though its proportions are colossal, the outline is pure and graceful; the expression of the head is mild, gracious, and tranquil; the character is African, but the mouth, and lips of which are thick, has a softness and delicacy of execution truly admirable; it seems real life and flesh. Art must have been at a high pitch when this monument was executed"" - Vivant DenonThere are tons of literature and hieroglyphs that suggest that the Egyptians were black yet there is no literature that remotely suggests that the Egyptians were white or had light skin. So why is there still a debate?Saying that Ancient Egypt was populated by Middle Easterners is like saying Ancient South Africa was populated by white people. The middle easterners didn't arrive until the 7th century.The reason why Riley made an all white adaptation of this movie is because Hollywood knows the power of propaganda and they know that the more they lie about Egypt being non-white the more it will be accepted as the truth, the same way we used to accept the lie that Columbus discovered America..",Exodus - Gods and Kings
621,koopaling,"Save your money, wait for the XXX version instead",3,11 December 2014,"I expected to see a historically accurate drama about white power running rampant through Ancient Egypt. This was a snooze fest all the way through. What a disgrace to our people. Christian Bale's acting barely topped the Spoon from the Matrix. Why were their accents British? This isn't the freaking Land of Narnia at least try to be legit here. Why didn't anyone give Joshua(Aaron Paul) some Nike sandals? Watching him struggle to walk in those flip flops was appalling. Best part of the movie was when Megatron came from the heavens and liberated the slaves with Energon cubes stolen from Ramses chariot. Oh, that didn't happen you say?

622,DBryars09,This film should have been titled Ducktales,1,11 December 2014,"This movie was a desperate attempt to white wash the history of Egypt. Egypt originally was filled with blacks 500 years ago, but yet there's barely any of them in the film. The great desire to turn Egyptians into Caucasians is baffling. They can keep making these films over and over again but it will not change true history. If this film bombs in the box office, I'm going to laugh. More and more people are getting fed up with these lies. They don't even look natural in that environment and cloth. One of the black actors I've seen listed for the film is playing an Egyptian Thief.White Historians kill me with this Egypt being black as a ""Hypothesis"". Stop. It's in Africa, look at all the countless drawing from their own people. EVERYONE was as black as day. Maybe even a little light skin black but overall they were clearly Black. Ridley Scott is one of my favorite filmmakers. He's a living legend. I'm sure the movie is still probably good as Ridley is great with historical subjects. But the Whitewashing has to stop. And if people continue to not speak up this will still happen. For 100 Years Hollywood has constantly portrayed Egypt as being White. I never want to pay for a white movie ever again , no matter how good it is.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

About 20 minutes in I was already regretting my decision to spend my hard earned cash on this film. Bale's acting is laughable and looks better suited for a SNL parody. Before I got up and left after I had my intelligence insulted for 30 minutes I made sure to dump my popcorn on the floor to punish this theater for even playing this.All in all I'd say stay far away from this film. Unless you are an insomniac and low on Nyquill, or need a laugh. Then watch it. Again, who casted this film? This depiction of this era in time is not only inaccurate it is hilariously played out on the big screen.Save your money and see something else. Trust me.

The movie drags on and on until it ends leaving you feeling worse off then when you came in to watch. I thought it would be better from the previews and all the hype (which clearly is unmerited) but it's not. Bale should stick with the Dark Knight roles he clearly did not know what he was doing attempting to take on the role of Moses. Bland dialogue, slow paced. You know what's coming, everything is already there for the movie to be a blockbuster and yet it amounts to an utter failure. This movie had potential to actually be done well but whoever green-lighted this should be fired. A waste of time!! Uninspiring film. Choppy. I don't think children would even enjoy watching the movie beyond a few special effects here and there. Not family- orientated, poorly executed. Would not see again.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
626,b256920,cast too white...,3,12 December 2014,It wouldn't have been a problem if the people responsible for making this movie just admitted that having white people play ancient Africans is pure fiction but Ridley Scott and Rupert Murdoch insisted on calling ancient Egyptians 'white' or 'middle eastern' or anything except African or black. I cant support this perversion of history. having Joel Edgerton play Ramses then the producers of the movie insisting the real Ramses was a white man is analogous to having Jude Law play Malcolm X and the producers insisting the real Malcolm X was a white man. According to wikipedia Ramses means Ra (is) the one who gave birth (to) him...being birth by the sun isn't a concept white skin people would embrace...also Europeans didn't have the capacity to create such a prodigious civilization in ancient times...they thought the sun revolved around the earth only 500 years ago and burned any books or people that said otherwise...,Exodus - Gods and Kings

The right people were not chosen for the job and that includes Scott and Bale. A cinematic *shaking my head*. There are other movies coming out today as well as for the remainder of the month which will hopefully help me forget this ridiculous piece of cinema. The studios got it wrong.

Doesn't that seem like a good idea? It is a pretty good book after all. Just like the movie Noah this movie pretends to be something that it isn't. Trying to cash in on what seems like ""the year of the Bible movie"" and yet not much biblical truth to be found in this movie. The people, the relationships and even God are portrayed as quite different from what is told in the Bible. The effects are impressive. You can't deny Hollywood is great at special effect.

I think people are critical of this movie because they want to see it exactly as the bible tells the story. Well . . . Consider this, the Old Testament's earliest papyri that have been found are written in Greek around 300–100 BC in fragments.According to the movie this is around 1800 BC. So that is one thousand five hundred years after the fact!!! The New Testamant's manuscripts they've found are written much closer to the actual time it took place which is with-in a hundred years. They find manuscripts written after those that are different then the earliest copies. So don't be so critical if this movie is different than the good book. Okay?

630,charitable-184-236254,"Bland, lazy and arrogant",1,12 December 2014,"We all know Scott can bring a vision to the screen with ease, create a sweeping vista and bring a dream to life. In part he does that here; a version of ancient Egypt is brought to life, superficially it seems right, until you realise this is all this movie has going for it.Its empty, like a chocolate cake with sawdust inside. I feel cheated, extremely disappointed, and unenlightened.Apart from the incredibly distracting casting choices, we know ancient Egyptians were brown to dark brown, the costumes and setting just didn't ring true and continuously brought me out of the movie and into the increasingly monotonous script that lacked any originality, spark or wit.Yes, this is straight by the numbers; even including a more 'scientific' approach to the story that I think was supposed to be clever or original, but just fell flat and drained even more life from the movie.Performances I felt were very ordinary; Bale played his usual character role, serious faced throughout, as did Edgerton, although yet again and again I found distracting his manicured eyebrows and shaven head, clearly a poor attempt to look 'other', when his role should have clearly gone to another. The so called must have big names Scott whined of, such as Weaver, had hardly a word to say.Its also overlong, or seems it. Large segments between set pieces drag on and on, you check your watch and instead of 30 minutes gone, you realise only 4 minutes have. This is nothing like gladiator. Scott has gotten old. Hes not going to get better.Only watch if you like a biblical epic with no originality and dour presentation.

While there were complaints about the absence of any actors of color, I'm grateful that no Black stars will be associated with this cinematic disaster.""""Here are several reasons why you should buy a bootlegged copy from Blackbusters instead of giving your hard earned cash to Rupert Murdock and Ridley Scott."" - Anthony Browder1. Rupert Murdock recently tweeted: ""Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are. They treated blacks as slaves.""2. Ridley Scott said that he didn't hire any Black leads for the film because, ""I (can't) get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up.""3. ""Exodus"" took more liberties with the Bible than the film ""Noah,"" which featured giant talking stones that helped Noah defeat his enemies.4. God is portrayed as an 11 year-old white male with a British accent.5. Exodus distorts known historical facts.  The film opens in 1300 BC with the battle of Kadesh which actually took place in 1275 BC King Seti I died in 1279 (4 years before the battle of Kadesh) and was buried in the Temple of Abu Simbel, which was built by Rameses II about 25 years later, and is not a tomb. The film shows pyramids being built during the reign of Seti and Rameses (who ruled during the 19 dynasty) when in fact the Egyptians stopped building pyramids in the 6th dynasty (about 1000 years earlier).6. :Exodus"" reinforces and amplifies old racial stereotypes. All the powerful people are white and all of the blacks are servants, slaves or security guards.

All those that complain is because they are wanting to support a side. It is about enjoying a good film not politics. It is ridiculous these days people still believing in god and complaining when others don't. And so what if mainstream known actors are used to depict Egyptians or hebrews...

The graphics and artistic view of the director were amazing, I don't think I would have enjoyed it in 3D, it would have made me dizzy. I will say that the beginning of the movie was a bit slow for me but after about 20 minutes or so, I was drawn in. I'm not sure why the reviews are so harsh about the film. Even though it didn't follow the biblical story to the word I found it to be just enough. Christian Bale did a great job in the film, the one surprise to me was seeing Sigourney Weaver in it, she had very few lines, I think an unknown actress would have been better.

637,Mudgutz1313,An unfortunate version of a historical moral lesson of freedom,1,14 December 2014,I have longed to see this story revised in today's age of movie making. What a total disappointment this version of an over 2000 year old story has become. Why try to change the image of truth to our new generation of future leaders. All they need is confirmation in the movies to understand the stories of their past. Sometimes doing something different isn't better. My reasoning for this is due to all the change in details. With the technology of today the original awe-striking story would have won an endless place in history. At many points I felt as if the story lost its direction with confusing omissions and additions.The lesson teaching points appeared to be from the opinion of a modern brain from 2015 instead of the perception an actual time lived character. The mystical image of the impossible becoming possible should not have been altered. Unfortunately my family will not be viewing this piece ever again.,Exodus - Gods and Kings

Christian Bale is a much better batman or American psycho than royalty. I would really hate for any of you to make my potato salad at family functions. I t would not be widely accepted nor eaten. Why have no descendants of royalty in this movie? Are you guys really proud of this portrayal of an alleged real story? This is watered down malarkey and I want no parts of this fanfiction mess.

I have enjoyed many movies by Mr. Scott but in my own personal opinion this movie was a complete waste of time and a false portrayal of the actual events of Exodus, Moses, God, the plagues, etc. How can an Atheist understand let alone direct an epic event in the Bible when he alone does not believe. I just hope that those who have never read the Bible do not for one minute think that this movie is a good representation. Yes, it is just a movie and Mr. Scott has enough money and power in Hollywood to make such a movie, but to be honest this is a slap in the face to true believers.

Those who expect this movie, which is supposed to be based in the Bible, to stick to the story as told in the Bible, will be very disappointed. Moses is portrayed as a terrorist and political activist. God is portrayed as a impetuous child, the dialog between God and Moses is largely left out and we are left to see him as a helpless, brain damaged, delusional caricature and not a hero at all. The producers seemed split between trying to portray the plagues against Egypt as natural events and God smiting Egypt. Oh, and Egypt is portrayed as a victim of Moses rampage. The ten commandments were apparently only carved once by Moses (as seen in the film), and the Israelites are portrayed as human cattle and nothing more. This film is anti-semitic, anti-Bible, anti-Christian and a total waste of time. The story is watered down to pointlessness. I found the film offensive at times and just plain boring at other times. Guess this is just Hollywood making another misguided attempt at a big budget movie themed (VERY) loosely around a Biblical hero.

641,mariabrownhearingclinic,Give old Moses a break!,8,14 December 2014,"I really quite enjoyed watching this film. I think for me it falls somewhere between Gladiator and Kingdom of heaven on the Ridley epics scale. I am not an overly religious man, so the bibles version of this story had little to no bearing on my thought processes going into this film.While I can agree with some of the feedback about some of the characters and back stories being slightly shallow. I was probably more impressed that a Ridley Scott film (usually a 3 hour affair) that was set in the desert, with most of the cast looking like some night club cross dresser or some homeless vagrant was able to not even once make me feel as though he was lingering around in any of the scenes! Not only that, I felt the pace of the film at times felt downright snappy. Which I really enjoyed. He told the story he wanted to tell, didn't waste my time, and still managed to make me care in most of the right places.It was lacking places however. I never got a true sense of the hardship of being a Hebrew slave. I like to have a bit of meat on my bone when it comes to these heavy issues. So I was not as motivated to see them be free as I would have liked. Also, I felt that Christian Bale, who usually delivers 10/10's for me, is simply so good, I at times had trouble seeing him as Moses in the first half of the film (the beard helped). Hats off to the casting for his wife however. I loved that no matter how drip fed she was for dialogue in this film, she still just nailed it. She was the emotional hook for me, but sadly she had little to nothing to do with the main storyline. This element alone meant that Exodus could never be as good as Gladiator.I felt the plagues and parting of the sea stuff to be handled in the mode plausible and logical way they would be occurring in Egypt. I have never thought of Gods work as something you just flick a switch on, so it was nice to see it all sort of come to town over and over. Also, some of the final scenes in Egypt were just amazing to watch. Best recreation of Egypt by a mile I have ever seen. This was all wrapped up in just truly insane production value which I am sorry, when your source material is as locked in as the story as Moses, it DOES make a difference to the final score. Ridley had to work with what he was given on a few elements and in my opinion he performed at a very high level as a director. Also, I have to applaud the soundtrack. I listened to it after seeing the film and its even more beautiful that it was in the film, to the point I actually felt moved on many occasions. It is put to great use towards the end of the film. Especially some of the scenes with Moses and his wife.Overall Ridley delivered a well paced, beautiful, aural, wonderful story of Moses. Yes he threw incredible amounts of money and talent at the screen and cheated slightly the get it over the line, but it was still a joy to watch.7.5/10",Exodus - Gods and Kings
642,bjhanford,not true to scripture,3,15 December 2014,"This movie, like Noah did not stay true to scripture. Disappointing. Hollywood needs to realize Christians that read the bible will pay attention to key elements omitted from the story. I give up on Hollywood trying to portray biblical events. What a shame. The actors selected were impressive but portraying God as a small boy is offensive as was Moses arguing with the child (God). The staff that Moses used to give him confidence bestowed upon him by God was completely left out of the movie. The idea that God made a pot of tea and served Moses, appalling.

Seriously how could you leave out the scene of the water rising and the people walking through. I was waiting to see the special effect for the scene but no this depicted that they were able to walk through because of low tide.I came with an open mind knowing some details would not be accurate but this was a boring inaccurate storyline. Also only the beginning seemed like it was in 3D.,Exodus - Gods and Kings
645,sel-shapiro,Terrible waste of time,1,16 December 2014,"One of the worst movies I've had to endure. Ninja Turtles combined with the biblical Exodus story. Lots of galloping horses and weird ""plagues"" but no intellectual content. Actors did their best with a shocking script and story line. Same crowd scenes repeated. No empathy with characters established. Proof that spending huge amounts of money doesn't make a good movie. Hope they lose money on this one so that they don't attempt a similar formula again Don't waste your precious time on this one. Surprising thing is that Bale and Edgerton, both excellent actors, agreed to be part of this. I guess they must have been paid very well. No other reason could be possible.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
646,renchica,Very ordinary,2,17 December 2014,"After seeing this film I asked myself why Ridley Scott made this movie. It does not portray the well-known characters in a new light, there is no new perspective added to this well-known ancient biblical story. Watching this movie was like reading the Bible. This story is in its essence, similar to the one developed in the Gladiator. While in Gladiator viewers easily relate to the destiny of a slave/gladiator and empathise with him and cheer for him when in danger, in Exodus, we are struggling to feel the same way for Moses. Ridley failed to connect the audience with this movie. Telling this epic story while trying to remain faithful to the Bible did not work out; the story remained flat and the characters one-dimensional. Moses in this film remains a relatively dry figure although there were opportunities to show his doubts, pain, uncertainties and other more interesting emotions and thoughts in a number of scenes: when he meets the Hebrew elders, when he fights the Egyptian guards, when he meets the Egyptian Viceroy, or even when he talks to his Mother and sister. The character of Moses is depicted in too symbolic terms which is not helping us to identify with him at the same levels we identified with the Spaniard in Gladiator. There are aspects to the story about Moses that could have been developed in such way that would make this movie more interesting to watch. I hope Ridley finds a way to go back to his old self and continues making great movies. Prometheus and now Exodus did not provide a great cinematographic experience. Perhaps Ridley's dedication of the movie to his brother Tony is in a way his admittance that he misses him not only as a brother but possibly also as a mentor, a soul-mate, someone who was there for Ridley all those years being a part of his making movies art. Yes, we miss you too Tony.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
647,cbbshopper,Stick to the Bible if you are making a movie about a Bible story. *Spoilers*,4,17 December 2014,"I am no movie critic but I was disappointed in this movie. I am always upset when a movie strays from the book it is based from. If you are going to make a movie from a story in the Bible here's a hint; stick to the Bible. Moses is told by God to use his staff to do the signs but in the movie he gives it to his son and tells him to watch over it. Another mistake because Moses did not leave his family, he took them with him. And the water is turned to blood because of crocodiles? Oh geeze. There is no pillar of fire, Moses doesn't part the sea because it disappears because of a current. I was looking forward to this because I felt it could be amazing scene since the water was ""a wall to them on their right hand and on their left"". I was also looking forward to Moses' encounter with God on the Mount with the burning bush. God is a boy and talks to him while Moses is sinking in mud. His wife then tells him he hit his head and whatever he thinks he saw/heard didn't happen. It was an alright movie but a terrible ""Bible story"" movie. I'm learning to not expect much from Hollywood when they make movies about the Bible. Dreamworks did a much better version of Moses in their animation movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
648,christopher-c-fisher,Christians should embrace this,10,17 December 2014,"I have to admit, as soon as I saw that Ridley Scott was directing an Exodus movie I was thrilled. I know Scott is not Christian. But with the care he treated Robin Hood and his visionary creation of Blade Runner, I knew that if anyone were to create a moving Exodus story it would be Scott. Exodus: Gods and Kings definitely did not disappoint.The story stars Moses (Christian Bale) as a cunning and brave adopted son of Seti. Moses fights Seti's wars and solves Seti's problems. Seti even considers Moses his true heir to the throne. But events go south soon after Seti dies and Ramses ascends to the throne. After Moses takes a trip to Goshen, a kleptocratic overseer learns that Moses is the son of a Hebrew. The overseer turns this information over to Ramses and Ramses banishes Moses.While banished, Moses meets his wife Zipporah and begins living as a goat herder. When a few of his livestock head onto God's holy mountain, Moses follows. He is subsequently hit on the head with a rock and begins seeing visions of God in the form of a little child. Before this time, Moses was an atheist, but now he returns to Egypt under the direction of Yahweh. He attempts guerilla warfare until ultimately allowing God's miracles to destroy Ramses.The film takes a few liberties. Moses is bold and courageous (this is actually a step up from the History channel Bible miniseries where Moses is depicted as a psychotically happy guy). Contrary to popular depiction, the Exodus narrative depicts Moses as reluctant and afraid (he was, after all, an eighty year old man at the time). Moses uses all sorts of petty excuses to try to avoid service to God. God gets angry at Moses and eventually is forced to recruit Moses' brother (Aaron) to do the heavy lifting. Aaron is almost entirely absent from the film.One criticism is that the film cannot seem to make up its mind if God is real or not. Moses only sees visions after a head blow (visions only he can see). And for a while all the miracles have real world explanations. But then the movie shifts to the angel of death, which has a none other than divine cause. For this, Scott adds a cutting remark against Christians ""Who can worship such a God who kills children."" The quote is placed well after a moving scene which should help Christians re-evaluate their understanding of Yahweh.For those who believe the Bible depicts an abstract God outside the bounds of space and time, this movie will do a lot of good to solidify a Biblical portrait of God. God is depicted as vengeful, powerful, and passionate. God is depicted as willing to compromise, but intent on harm. Moses is even shown to be less willing than God to resort to violence (consistent with the Biblical narrative). The scenes go as far as to show some of the tension between God and Moses. At one point Moses asks God what He has been doing for 400 years. Moses is accusing God (a common theme in the Psalms), which God does not answer except with ""Tu quoque"".Towards the end, the movie hints at the Exodus 32 narrative where Moses convinces God not to destroy Israel. But sadly, the movie skips what would be an interesting twist in the narrative where God plans on killing the people He had just saved.The character actions and motivations are believable. Ramses is shown as arrogant and strong willed. Ramses lets Israel go in a fit of passion after his son dies, but quickly changes his mind due to his pride. Moses is practical, and attempts to use his practicality to win God's campaign. The people react to the plagues with riots and pillage, as would be expected. Even Moses' wife and son are shown hurting as Moses leaves on a quixotic quest of which they are skeptical. One missed opportunity was the Exodus' narrative of the elders of Israel opposing Moses while in Egypt. There is little hint of Israel's reluctance for freedom. Israel's rejection could have easily shown what odds Moses faced, even from his own people. Instead, Israel is shown as steadfast and unified.Most other complaints are petty: the number of Israelites freed, the number of consultations with Pharaoh, the reason for the Nile turning to blood, the way in which the Egyptian soldiers were killed by Moses. The film is faithful to the narrative and spirit of the Exodus account. I would recommend it to all Christian families. If your children are allowed to watch The Passion of the Christ, they should be old enough to see Exodus: Gods and Kings.Now the real question remains: how do we get Ridley Scott to direct a fitting Noah film?",Exodus - Gods and Kings
649,ronjes100,what a waste of time and money.,1,18 December 2014,"It was so inattentive to authenticity of any kind that I am surprised that they did not have the Jews eating pork chops in the movie. Moses was so far removed from the original character that they might as well also have put the historical location as the North Pole instead of Egypt. Moses' imagination of God was portrayed as the result of a suffered head injury and represented by a boy with a British accent. All the miracles were portrayed as natural phenomenon. Whether the original story was true or not is not the issue here. The original story is great and this movie was a missed opportunity to portray that. Ever seen an alien? I have not, yet we have great alien movies. Ever seen God? I have not, yet Hollywood can't seem to apply the same logic and art to religious movies as they do to science fiction.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

I hope he continues to create more biblical renditions because as of right now he is the best there is out there!None of you know how the story actually happened.

651,fides-ramos,its like ripping the Exodus pages from the Bible..,6,19 December 2014,"Alright. Let me first breath deeply! OK, here we go. I just watched Exodus by Ridley Scott and I must say that I am completely disappointed with the adaptation. If you are a God believer and you really want to see the film just because you have read the story in the Bible and have seen The Prince of Egypt by Dreamworks and, want to be surprised and feel proud of this generation's adaptation, well get ready to be pretty disappointed! The movie script was awful. Miriam became an awful Hebrew who denied her nationality twice! She did not even joined the Exodus! AOL. I was really looking forward to see the conversation of Moses with God in Mt. Sinai and I was shocked to watch Moses getting hit by an avalanche of boulders and mud! Then there was this boy who is definitely not God at all to me! AOL and the burning bush behind the boy..silent..no whispers..no whooshing silver flames wrapping Moses or whatsoever..just there acted like some sort of a lamp to shed some light while Moses' body was buried in mud in exception of his face..ha ha, what a great and very inconvenient way to talk with quote God end quote. When he was back to his tent, the script made the story worse when Moses' wife says he's just being delusional about God as a boy. Next, when it came to the plagues part, it was no match compare to the Prince of Egypt which by the way, a ""cartoon"" version. I wasn't moved at all and I even felt sleepy which never happened to me before inside a movie theater! OK, so let's get on to the parting of the Red sea part...Moses, wasn't granted the staff of God because it was pretty obvious in the movie, that there is no God, and its just yourself and you look crazy when other people see you talking to yourself. Yeah, so Moses hurled his sword to the sea and it was just a coincidence that it stood straight on the sea bed and it became a sea level indicator. When Moses woke up, he saw the sword and realized that it was a very low-tide and they crossed the sea..without the chasing of the Egyptian soldiers and the panic..well there was panic but it was a little late panic. Come on, every one wanted to see how this generation's parting of the Red sea will beat the vintage and the cartoon versions! Lastly, I think it was really poor to see Moses chiseling the ten commandments on chunks of cold tablets and not with the hands of God. Seriously, the makers of this movie, didn't create any of the scenes where God in the Bible showcased His great glorious power. I read somewhere that R. Scott is also working on a movie called The Son of God.. in an atheistic view. Let's see how Jesus would perform miracles in the movie..on stage with a couple of Mary Magdalenes... oh Gee... I rate this film: 4/10 and the points goes to the costumes and the CGI effects.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
652,bmoore8663-190-390546,Movie would have reaped more money if it stuck to the scriptures,4,19 December 2014,"I was reluctant in seeing this movie after being so disappointed in the movie Noah. However, I had hoped that the writer would have not made the same mistakes in making Christians mad by tearing apart biblical truths. This movie could have been so much better if it had used Moses' brother to speak and his staff/rod to bring forth the miracles. I did not understand why the movie was complicated with a child speaking in the place of God. The whole Red Sea deal made me want to scream! There are ten plagues mentioned in the bible (whatchristianswanttoknow.com /list-of-the-ten-plagues-in-egypt-from-the-bible), so why did they have to make up some? Even the exit from Egypt (which is what Exodus means) was anti-dramatic - no gold exchange? The best things about this movie were the costumes, cinematography and the trailer. I agree with other reviews that casting was poor. In summary, I got suckered into believing that the film writers actually referenced the Old Testament scriptures for the source in writing the script to gain acceptance of bible believers and increase their chances for box office profits.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
653,mladen-bradac,Expensive mask ball,3,19 December 2014,"One of the first scenes in a movie, and there it was, like in many historical movies (not talking fantasy like Conan)i found a mistake.To be more specific the clang of modern forged metal (swords), and we know it was a bronze age (3300bc-1300bc). Another thing that struck me was way to many white (pale) people, and its known for a fact that ancient Hebrew's were dark skin people, not to mention Egyptians, and they put Sigourney Weaver and Christian Bale in it. Another problem i had watching this movie was English language, caused by Joel Edgerton staring Ramses, who's physical appearance perfectly embodied his character, but his interpretation both physical and lingual suited more for some cowboy in a western (reminded me of John Wayne). Mistakes keep piling up, so you get bothered with every little detail. I was bothered with writers, and their rational explanation of plagues Moses prophesied will fall upon Egypt, but stick to a story in some other accounts, such as death of first born children as gods punishment etc. The god appearing as a little boy was less then unconvincing, oh and did i mention with distinct English accent. Aldo Christian Bale was trying very hard to live up to his role, and Ben Kingsley did the job impeccable, this adaptation was poorly done leaving me in regret for all those millions spend in vane.

As a Christian, my husband and I thought we were going to see an inspirational Christmas movie only to be disappointed in how the movie was so far from the true Word of God, that we left saddened instead of inspired. The movie portrayed natural occurrences in the place of the supernatural. The movie featured God as a young boy who constantly argued and competed with Moses to see who best could get Pharaoh's attention to free the Hebrews. Moses carried a sword instead of a staff and killed 4 men. There was no parting of the Red Sea of which Pharaoh survived the Red sea instead of drowning. Crocodiles were used to turn the water into blood. This was a scene similar to the movie ""Jaws"" in which the crocodiles were launching out of the water and biting men. The bloody water caused the frogs to leave the water, which then caused the flies to come once the frogs started to die on the land. One scene after another displayed the accounts in the bible so different than what we read in the Word of God that I pray that if you do not know the truth, find out for yourself and pick up the bible and read the truth instead of believing what you see in this movie.

First, the scale and visual impact of the movie is what I had hoped for. Christian Bale portrayed a Moses driven by conscience and destiny yet equally overwhelmed by the loss of his former princely status and a God whom he had never encountered before. The plagues are horrifying but presented in a way that does not descend into a protracted display of ""ancient magic"" the way it could so easily have been perceived.

I do believe that it is important in todays world, to be as close to the Truth in creating stories of the bible. It is the Word of God, so why change it. ????? It would've been a nice touch so that the younger generation could see and enjoy such great special effects as many of us enjoyed watching the Ten Commandments in our day. It's not a movie that I would recommend to my students to see a bible story created into a movie.

But I figured that in this day and age, they can fix all the inaccuracies that were in ""The Ten Commandments"" and make it awesome! But...Hollywood is plastic. They feel they can improve on a story that's endured unchanged for thousands of years. So their numbers, ages, and side stories are way off.I won't go into all the details, but during the montage of ""Moses training the Hebrews in archery"" I thought I was watching Robin Hood. And while I love the ""infamous sword"" as much as the next guy, when they replaced Moses's staff with an Egyptian sword like Excalibur which he toted around the whole movie, it was a little ridiculous. Moses technically was about 80 years old when he went to Pharaoh, not a 40 year old warrior in body armor.They totally diluted G-d's character in this biblical story. So instead of Moses talking to G-d, he was talking to a little boy, apparently in his head. I guess this gives Atheists an out. And instead of Moses and Aaron going to Pharaoh and warning him of each plague if he didn't free the Hebrews, they made the plagues seem like a series of unfortunate events, starting with some wild crocodile attacks. But G-d (the little boy) did make some tea for Moses while he was carving the tablets. That was so nice of him!The casting was way off! Sigourney Weaver popped in for a few unnecessary scenes and looked so out of place, as well as Jesse from Breaking bad. Aaron's character played a useless role, and everyone in the movie had different accents. Christian Bale had an American accent, while many others had English accents, though there was the occasional Spanish accent.I know, movies aren't reality, they're supposed to be ""heightened reality"". But personally, if you read the 3,000 year old story, it's already such an awesome story as it is, and needs no embellishment! That's why it's still a bestseller for thousands of years!

They were of African descent Hebrews and Egyptians were Afro/Asiatic not ""White Europeans"" as portrayed in the movie.‪#‎Moses‬ was born in1393 BCE and lived until 1273 BCEIn the first minute of the movie the paragraph reads: ""1300 BCE, for 400 years the Hebrew have been salved to Egypt, building there statues, its cities, its glory.""This posts expands on some of the history behind the people who actually built the pyramids.The Great ‪#‎Pyramid‬ of ‪#‎Giza‬ (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu) is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids. It is the oldest of the ‪#‎SevenWonders‬ of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. It was constructed from 2560-2540BC.Most of Egypt's large pyramids were built over a 900 year period from about 2650 BCE to about 1750 BCE.It is of note to mention that during this time there were no Jews in Egypt. But there were lots of ‪#‎Canaanites‬ who were in Egypt for various reasons. Canaanites regularly fled to Egypt during times of famine in their own land. Some were merchants who traded with Egyptians. And some were sold as slaves to ‪#‎Egyptians‬.So, if ‪#‎Jews‬ were not in Egypt at the time of the ‪#‎Pyramids‬, what about Israelites or ‪#‎Hebrews‬? Israel itself did not exist until approximately 1100 BCE when various Semitic tribes joined in ‪#‎Canaan‬ to form a single independent kingdom, at least 600 years after the completion of the last of Egypt's large Pyramids. Thus it is not possible for any Israelites to have been in Egypt during the time the pyramids were constructed, either slave or free; as there was not yet any such thing as an ‪#‎Israelite‬. It was about this same time in history that the earliest evidence of the Hebrew language appeared: The Gezer Calendar, inscribed in limestone, was discovered in 1908. And so the history of Israel is very closely tied to that of Hebrews, and for the past 3,000 years, they've been essentially one culture.But wait wait wait; they claimed in the movie that ""Hebrew People"" build Egypt's glory, cities and statues and they were ‪#‎slaves‬ So let's talk about the labor force that built the Pyramids. The best estimates are that more than 10,000 men spent around 20-30 years building the Great Pyramid. They lived in good housing at the foot of the Pyramid, and when they died, they received honored burials in stone tombs near the Pyramid in thanks for their contribution. This information is relatively new, as the first of these worker tombs was only discovered in 1990. They ate well and received the best medical care. And, also unlike slaves, they were well paid. The Pyramid builders were recruited from poor communities and worked shifts of three months (including farmers who worked during the months when the ‪#‎Nile‬ flooded their farms), distributing the pharaoh's wealth out to where it was needed most. Each day, 21 cattle and 23 sheep were slaughtered to feed the workers, enough for each man to eat meat at least weekly. Virtually every fact about the workers that archeology has shown us rules out the use of slave labor on the #pyramids.What I find it really interesting"" based on the movie statement that the Hebrew People build Egypt's glory, How come since the Exodus and the ‪#‎HebrewPeople‬ left ‪#‎Egypt‬ with Moses, there's a number of ""Big zero"" of Pyramids, temples, statues as big as what Egypt have?!?Movies such as ‪#‎ExodusGodsandKings‬ can be founded on some factual basis in an ancestral memory but most often are joined with exaggerated mythical accounts. In this instance leading to the foundational story of the Jews.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

This film you can not compare it with the ten commands for production, acting, story chain, respect for every part written in the Bible.

The picture was more about his ability as warrior than him being a person given a divine mission to free an enslaved people and teach them the will of the Almighty. The image of a child given Moses his mission is a joke. The splitting of the sea did not happen and many other biblical events ignored. The 1956 - Ten Commandments was far better and Christian Bale is no Charlton Heston! I was totally surprised as to the disrespect shown Moses and totally inaccurate account of that which is stated in the Hebrew Bible and other other reliable sources! The special effects were nothing to marvel at and there is no character in the movie which gives the story of Moses end the Exodus any inspiration!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
670,stxmassive_2000,Fail: Thank God I didn't Waste Money on the Imax 3D version,1,31 December 2014,"This movie is a Major fail from any angle: Christian, Non-Christian, Atheist, Religiously, Historically, Biblical, Imaginatively, cinematography, etcetera, ANY angle--FAIL!. OK. I saw the movie. And that was before I read these comments. I went into the movie with an open mind thinking ""it's Hollywood, it's not going to be accurate or correct"" that way I wouldn't be too disappoint as you know how these ""biblical movies"" go. I must say that although I went in with that mindset hoping to not be so critical and disappointed, I still ended being critical and somewhat disappointed. First, I really don't care about people who use Hollywood as their source of information rather than reading the bible or other sources for themselves. So, my disappointment or concern is not regarding telling the truth as it is written per se.I think Hollywood missed a great opportunity to do some really good effects, and also painting the picture of how God used a humbled Israelite (in a magician ""Hollywood"" type of way). It would've have been a better plot to keep the historically written text as is--God speaking to Moses (audibly not as some white monk looking kind of Dali lama kid), then Moses speaking to Aaron, then Aaron raising Moses staff to carry out the sign of YaH's sovereignty over Egypt to the world. Too much time was spent on filler narratives that weren't even accurate or true at all. Most people would think that if you're going to spend time on something, it's probably true and worth it—definitely not this movie at all. More time could've been spent on the signs. I was very disappointed in the sign of thick darkness--don't even think they really showed that part come to think of it. And alligators eating up people and other alligators made to water red? Really? That's factually harder for even an atheist to believe that what's actually written in the bible. Besides many other things, that was the big ""oh-C'ome on"" moment in the film to me.So, there's my point of view. Considering the brief 20 mins or so used to *rapidly* show the plagues/signs I'm giving this movie some bonus points—brings this movie to about 10% accurate. That movie was sad, knowing all the missed opportunities to really bring it to life. This really makes one wonder what was the real intent in making this movie in the first place. This movie should've been named ""Slavery in Egypt: Retold"", or ""Egypt's Pharaoh"" anything as long as it doesn't have a biblical connection, or ""Exodus"", ""Moses"", or ""Israel"" in the title. I have to agree with you all--just more blatant and willful propaganda. Such a shame and disappointment. I am blacklist these producer/author/director: Ridley Scott, Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine, Steven Zaillian-- No more movies from you. smh.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
671,ebiamonte93,"Exodus Gods and Kings, had promise, but was reduced to creative nonsense by its writers and director.",2,1 January 2015,"I watched the movie Exodus Gods and Kings yesterday evening. What I viewed had promise, but was reduced to creative nonsense by its writers and director. The Good: the struggle the children Israel had to endure as slaves in Egypt. The Bad: creative nonsense, through the character of Moses. A poor script that reduced one of histories most powerful story lines to an action adventure movie with poor editing. The removal of key Biblical elements. This movie gets TWO STARS at best. What could have been an epic movie for generations to come will go down as an epic Hollywood failure.

This movie has a poorly written script, and absolutely some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I don't know maybe I expected too much from the film. But I can't help but believe, that with a better script and actors, the movie could have been an epic. Sigourney Weaver was never a great actress, and now that her looks are failing her she is even worse. Christian Bale was another poor choice,he makes an absolutely terrible Moses.

673,kokujin_21,Book Was Better,1,3 January 2015,"If there was a 0 on this scale, it'd be there, but I guess I can give it a one for the excellent use of 3D as well as the film score.I looked at this film partly for enjoyment and more with a critical eye. I read the reviews, so I knew what to expect, but at the same time, I didn't. From the opening scene, I already knew the intent of the filmmaker was to push some kind of social justice/political theme served with a side of Gladiator. Fortunately, I wasn't really feeling this theme or the Gladiator gore for that matter. The characters were flat and lacked all the complexity and depth that could have been there. Ramses was portrayed to be a laid-back son with no interest in kingdom other than the luxurious aspect. Moses seemed to be disconnected between the two parties: Egypt and Israel. He appeared more like some faithless unrelated outsider who felt some kind of moral responsibility for rescuing the margined and abused children of Israel. There was no deep or noticeable connection with his people, and the only real relationship he seemed to have maintained was with that crazy hallucination of ""God"" he kept having--I say this because he's been hit on the head quite a bit.Then there's the issue of God--God who is portrayed as a bratty ten- year-old kid giving tea parties. Every time he shows up, it's like something out of a horror film: creepy. The kid himself is more like an adviser, fumbling his way through the film, which I am sure is the filmmaker's intent. The miraculous that was so heavily reliant on God's power is less than lackluster and is portrayed more like a series of random coincidences. Ridley Scott even takes a page of the National Geographic's Exodus discussion years ago about the Red Sea parting: a leaf blower and an eight hour tsunami.Overall, the movie is terribly inaccurate; there's so many other things I can point out, but I will keep my review short. I can settle for SOME artistic license such as filling in some historical details of what Moses might've been doing in Egypt, such as in the Ten Commandments. He might've been a general; he might not have, but the extra added fluff is just overdoing it. Instead of a film focusing on the true power of the Living God, Scott serves a film reliant on self-effort, coincidences, and tea parties, giving audiences a strange work of fiction.If you want the TRUE story, you're better off reading the book of Exodus and finding out who God really is (and Moses, too).",Exodus - Gods and Kings
674,yaakovtheyid,This is absolutely terrible from research to entertainment,3,4 January 2015,"Outside of some cool effects the movie was rotten. First off the Jews built storage cities, not pyramids and tombs. Moses was connected to G-d from birth. He was not an agnostic who came to believe. He had a staff which was a pivotal part of the story that the movie missed. So many factual problems its not funny. And if he would of kept with the facts, hired a Rabbi to supervise, this movie would of been way more amazing. And nowhere in anyones estimation did G-d show himself as a child. He was a bush, a cloud and lightning on a mountain. But this movie tries to pass him off as an angry child and not a loving G-d. I can see why one commenter chose to say Ridley was anti xtian. Because he made the story into a big boring joke. And anyone who doesn't know the story will be led to believe the real story cannot be true based on this account. It seems that was what Ridley was trying to do. And Ridley certainly never studied with a Rabbi to be sure.Noah on the other hand was mostly factual and therefore much more entertaining. Many religious people who haven't read Jewish commentary thought it not factual, but almost everything in it had a source. It may not have been the generally accepted version, but he had sources. It was a much better adaptation of the bible story, and it was a pretty good movie. Not a 10 but I'll give it a 7. While Exodus gets a 3. Ridley, this goes to show you that your name is not strong enough to make a crap movie and sell it. And poor Christian Bale is ruined from this film. Please, if your thinking of watching this movie, please do not waste your time. It's a big disappointment.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
675,gwilliamsjr12,"Okay it was inaccurate, but look deeper",8,4 January 2015,"All right, I can see what everyone is complaining about now. Yes, this movie was very inaccurate and it seemed to skip through a lot of important parts. For instance, there was such an anticipation for the whole parting of the sea scene and it wasn't even in the movie. I'm thinking that it would have been the climax of the movie; however, all you see is the water returning to drown Pharaoh & his soldiers and then Pharaoh somehow recovers....(really!). Also, the Ten Commandments and it's creation was covered but it seemed rushed. No breaking of the tablets, no mention of the gold idol the Israelites created, or anything. It appeared that they shot ton of footage, but found out they had to make a ton of cuts as well to preserve time. Well, I guess to tell the story right, it would have had to be longer or they could have done it in segments. What I was impressed about was the deeper meaning of the movie. God, portrayed as a child, developed a relationship with Moses. He showed/told Moses about his plan and also showed Moses his awesome sovereignty. It was tough for Moses to swallow and their times of disagreement felt very real. Many times we disagree or get mad with God due to trials or tribulations. I really appreciated seeing that relationship dynamic between God and Moses in this movie. Also, the plagues were depicted very well. Even though it was CG mostly, you felt the anguish they were going through. So if you're looking for historical accuracy then don't go see it. Remember it's Hollywood. Sit there and view the movie like it's a story based on the real thing. The point is this...God can do whatever he wants to do and sometimes he does things that we don't understand. This is because his way of thinking is not our way of thinking. Our minds our finite, HIS mind is infinite. ""Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths"" Proverbs 3:5-6 (KJV). Regardless of how it looks, God is in control!!! Be blessed.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

What I liked most about the movies is how they balanced drama, action and adventure. This way, many watchers would want to see the movie.

Completely detached from the correct version of events and details. With a clear intention to minimize God (represented by an arrogant brat who only serves tea).Everything is twisted.

679,simone-nehme,Historical point of view..,8,9 January 2015,"This review does have some spoilers** This movie was actually quite good. While there were a couple of inaccuracies there were many accuracies. Many people complain about the staff not being in the film but I believe that the staff was replaced with the sword and the director used it as a symbol of brotherhood. Both for the Hebrews and with Ramses. So with that cleared up I'd like to talk about how people don't like the idea of the plagues sprouting from the first which was the blood. I didn't like the fact that crocodiles were used but other then that I thought it was good. No one liked how the plagues were narrated as nothing more than just a mere sequence of events that spread because of each other.. However you must keep in mind that the ancient Egyptians always tried to find a reasonable explanation for every event so of course the advisor's are going to advise that these events are no more than consequences of the first event. Don't feel bummed about the way they tried to make it a matter of nature. Another thing I really enjoyed about the movie was the costuming and set up. I thought it was pretty accurate so i liked that about it. I do believe that middle eastern actors should have been used. I don't mind that the Egyptian pharaoh was a bit weak. I assume for many men a son is the most important thing for him so for an Egyptian in a time where modern medicine did not exist you can feel his pain when his son and only heir to the throne dies. To add his a king of a massive empire so he can't really show emotions. I like how the director allowed it in this movie. There's an interesting point you all might like to hear before I make my last point. The symbols used are accurate although inaccurate to their time. I'm not quite sure if the time period is right but the symbol you see on the piece of parchment is actually a Phoenician letter that in modern times translates to ""M"" so it might mean ""Moses"", ""Meeting"" or even the place ""Memphis"". I don't know but I was pleasantly surprised to see it considering I myself am Lebanese - Modern day Phoneician. One thing I'd like to explain before i finish off is the title ""Exodus God's and Kings"". Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh's believed that in life they were in fact gods. God's on earth. They also believed that once they entered the afterlife they would become a God among many of the other gods.. so I like the title and think it's appropriate. As it was a battle between gods and kings. God's as in the Pharoah and the Hebrew god. And the kings as in the Pharoah and the people who are ""the chosen ones of the Hebrew god"". Over all nice movie. Good graphics and pleasing screen time.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
680,nkopelias,It's just a fiction and not even a good one,2,11 January 2015,"The story of Exodus written in the Bible is treated by the script writer, as if it is just a myth. Bible is an historic book. So anyone changing what is written in it, is just making a fiction. Well this fiction is not even a good one. The facts of Exodus are not described correctly and the way they are presented seems fake and excessive. Did God kill thousands of innocent fishermen just to make the river bloody? Why would He do that, since it's was easier for Him to say just the word. Also it seems that Moses had no part in the negotiations with the pharaoh and he was just an observer of the facts. The role of Aaron is also omitted. The significance of the stick of Moses is deleted. Finally God is represented by a boy. Why? We all know that God did not present Himself to Moses or any one else in the Old Testament. Only His voice was heard.

684,blwriting,Not bad.... but expected more from such a great and ancient story!,6,8 March 2015,"The movie was decent in many aspects, but in my opinion lacked some necessary scenes to make it complete. Even having great actors, retelling of any Biblical story is not an easy task and will come under great scrutiny as it is 'sacred' to many of the viewers. Still the feature held my attention with great makeup and costume design along with believable CG effects. I feel that the plagues deserve mention on a cinematographic level, as they were done quite well. I also think the choice made for terrestrial embodiment of God was an interesting choice. That being said, I would have liked to have seen Moses climbing up Mt. Sinai (as was hinted that he would earlier in the movie) to receive the first set of Commandments. But his trek up the mountain was never shown. It was lacking to just show him in a cave scribing the tablets...a missed opportunity for affect and to keep with the traditional Biblical story. I would have liked to have seen him smash the first set of tablets upon learning that his people had built a false idol while he was on the mountain and for the length of time he spent on the mountain to at least be illustrated to show why the Hebrew people were losing faith which lead to their transgression of idolatry. Ridley Scott did choose at least to show Moses' physical transformation after his time with God on Mt. Sinai, but as for the making of the Arc of the Covenant, that was auspiciously left out. Aaron being made high priest was left out as well and I feel that it was a missed opportunity in the telling of the story and a missed opportunity to show his unearthly, jeweled breastplate that had a connection to the Arc and the tablets. Finally, after all of Moses' sacrifices for his people, I feel it should have ended with his death at the border of Canaan, after the 40 years of wandering which was never mentioned either. To ask about four decades of desert survival by the Hebrew people thanks to God's gift of manna I know would have been too much, but if you are going to tell the story of the Exodus at least mention the baking of unleavened bread, which we still traditionally eat today at Passover in commemoration of this ""Exodus"" journey. I am more a student of religion than a devout practitioner, but I do feel that even though the movie was a bit long, tell the entire story if you are going to attempt any retelling. Some other scenes could have been omitted or just realize that it's a Ridley Scott production and that it will probably be lengthy. I rather have a better, more in depth and accurate account than a film that just ends before the story is over. So I guess I feel it should have been more accurate at the expense of it being a longer movie or that other less important scenes could have been deleted for an accurate retelling. I do realize the movie was not called ""MOSES"" but the entire story of the Exodus was not achieved. It is still worth a watch, especially when we are usually drowning in a plethora of foolishly bad movies about increasingly ridiculous topics. Look at the cast and realize that these actors are generally not choosing worthless scripts. I think everyone had higher aspirations for this film and it's a shame that it fell short in some (not all) areas.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
685,fabilation1,Fantastic movie!!!,10,18 January 2015,"The movie is excellent! I went to the cinema without giving credit to this movie because of some reviews I'd read on the internet that said it was heretical since it was different from the bible. The movie really only omitted very important biblical details, but the essentials that have the capacity to provoke reflection about God and men through the many generations in which this story has been told, remain.The movie is fantastic because it has portrayed in the figures of Moses and Pharaoh, how some men can accept God's commandments and justice, even in a hesitant way, in a simple act of faith, and those who do the opposite.In the character of Ramses I could see the difficulty that we, as people, have accepting the idea that the justice of God exists as a consequence of the terrible acts committed by humanity. Normally justice is more acceptable when meted out by men in the form of the state using methods such as prison, hanging, lethal injection or even by vigilantes. However when the ""hand of God"" is mentioned it's deemed as heresy, His existence called into question, where He's presumed bad, where His existence couldn't be possible if He allowed this or that misfortune. What if the state isn't able to intervene? What if the state is the tormentor? What if the tormentor to the human eyes is invincible? What if only a miracle could end the oppression?The Ramses dynasty enslaved the Jews for more than 400 years using them to build their empire and, in the attempt to curtail their growing strength, killed all the new born babies, firstly killing them when they were just born, then throwing the babies in the Nile. So, when Ramses having inflicted just a bit of this kind of pain (without having man or nation as provocation), speechless and impotent when facing his own suffering, instead of taking into account his own previous actions, presumes God as evil and does not repent, or see himself as evil. Quite the opposite, he therefore suffers, fuming like a spoilt child. He is his own god: holder of judgment, life and death. That's why the gospel can be seen as being all about repenting and changing. The insight is that even from someone acting badly good can come. The lesson gleaned from this is that God's justice, even if it takes a long time, comes. Despite the fact that it is terrible, it is still a thousand times better than the justice of man. As David said in his psalm: ""I would rather fall into Your hands than my enemies', because even in your wrath you show mercy"". I read several reviews saying that in the movie Ramses was obtuse with no expression, but for myself, that's exactly the way people with a hardened heart act.Moses, ironically, was Israeli and through his mother's act of faith was put in a basket and left drifting in the Nile instead of being killed in the moment he was born, then eventually was found by the pharaoh's daughter who raised him as a son. Despite being an Egyptian prince, for some reason and at some point, he left all behind and went to the desert to live as a Bedouin until the time God called him. It is fantastic how the movie portrays the growing relationship between Moses and God. From the moment they first met until near the time of Moses death: Moses was hesitant, suspicious, sometimes believing, sometime doubting and almost always questioning. Besides the dualism, the constant negation, Moses ends up launching himself into the adventure proposed by God, just like Jesus's example in the parable of two sons: the one that says to the father that he is going to do as he is asked and then turns his back and does not obey; and the other that in the first moment denies obedience to the father, but straight away repents and does what he was told.In the end of the story, it seems that that servitude is put aside and agreement happens. Moses, gradually, says that he understands and agrees with God. The servitude seems to fade away and the friendship is established. I found it very similar to what Jesus said to His disciples after they had spent a good time together: ""Today, I don't call you servants anymore because the servants don't know what the Master does, but I call you friends, because friends know what the Lord does"".Moses goes back to Egypt trying to free the people by his own ways, making use of his war strategies learnt while he lived there. However, God demands that he only observe and see what He was going to do. Then, the plagues that devastated Egypt, historically proved, begin. The movie, in a fantastic way, tries to show that one event has initiated another. Nothing problematic in that since the actual science cannot deny Gods existence, since it does not prove the opposite. But even science becomes silent after the last plague which established the Hebrew Passover and consequently the Christian too, even if their meanings can be opposite for some and complementary for others.Despite the initial shock, the idea of God assuming the form of a child can be seen as coherent. After all, Jesus said that in order to inherit His kingdom we should become like them, perhaps because only children have the ability to believe this kind of story. Moses had to be like one! Going back to Egypt, a place where people wanted him killed! Just children or crazy people would act this way. Written by FAbiola Ribeiro and Collin Meyes",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Omg say about cut out loads I did not realised 2 hrs was cut until I read reviews of it. The original 10 commandments was just over 3 hrs and even if you believed it to be true or not was an excellent film for its time. This version did have more realistic content like the 7 plagues and the waves and given and Ramses surviving the waves, the way the 10 commandments was foreseen but my good it felt rushed. Watching this version I was very disappointed Did not even start with baby mosses even the dealth of children was rushed. I really hope I get the extended DVD version of this. For a film by this director I had high hopes but it was a very sad disappointment.

687,emmetkellyactor,fantastic movie,10,23 January 2015,"Despite what fanatics will have you believe this is a remarkable movie. Why this movie is being slated is beyond me. The writing is natural. The cinematography is beautiful and exciting. The score is riveting. The sets, costumes and props are spot on and the use of CGI is warranted with some very exceptional and exciting scenes. Ridley Scott Brilliantly paces the movie with great story telling and bringing out some great performances from the whole cast especially Christian Bale. The score and the CGI is mind blowing. The character and story development is exceptional and o was on the edge of my seat throughout. I see every movie that comes out and I cannot understand how this movie has such low ratings. Get yourself to the cinema and watch Ridley Scott do what he does best with a fantastic cast",Exodus - Gods and Kings
688,plkbox,Not so bad!,6,29 January 2015,"O.K. it's not a brilliant movie, but the (biblical) story is interesting enough to watch the movie anyway. The best part of the picture is, the fragment about the plagues and the worst the splitting of the sea. It's funny but the film characterizes Ramses far better than Moses. Especially the story with Ramses son, that is present the biggest part of the film. You learn a lot about the Egyptian part of the story in contrast there is almost nothing about the Jews. In fact Moses in the movie is also an Egyptian general. You can say that it's primarily not a movie about the Jews but about old Egypt. Beside of that I fully agree with all the criticism about the movie.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
689,murteza-afg,Worst Account of Moses,1,2 February 2015,"This was by far the worst account of the story of Moses I had seen. The cartoon ""The Prince of Egypt"" did a much better job.Moses, God's messenger was made to be a barbaric tyrant who fights, argues and yells at God. God was depicted in the movie as literally a little boy, who is hell bent on destruction of everyone and anyone until Pharaoh listens to him. Pharaoh actually seemed more humane that Moses and the poor depiction of God. At one point the little boy who is suppose to be God starts serving Moses tea...Needless to say that this movie was extremely full of blasphemy.Moses kills more people than I have fingers to count. He tries gorilla warfare against Pharaoh, something he never did according to scriptures. He's depicted as very violent and aggressive. The story of Moses going up the mountain for the first time and seeing the burning bush is wrong too. He supposedly hits his head and the movie tries to imply that because of that, he was seeing and hearing things, which was God in the form of a boy.Basically this movie tries to logically explain all the miracles that happened with Moses. The sea didn't even part, the water went down SO low that they could walk on it, and then raised back up.Absolutely worst account of Moses. Clearly the director has no belief in God or the story of Moses.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
690,silviadipastena,Exodus and the God you do not expect.,8,1 March 2015,"To change the air, you do not always go too far. Sometimes a movie can suffice. Exodus-Gods and Kings, is a film that takes you two hours to walk through time and space, of the Pharaohs in Egypt and slavery, injustice and passions. It takes you in the pages of the Bible and its questions, the discovery of the leader Moses and his relationship with God. The director, Ridley Scott does not need any introduction and Cristian Bale seems to have overcome of Batman's fear and is faced with many other missions: to bring his people, the Jews, in the Promised Land, freeing them from slavery. The film hits in the colors, landscapes, nature while you watch, but opens to reflections once the curtains closed. First of all: how much truth there is in the film than the Bible? I do not deny that the film makes you want to open that dusty book in the library, to see if the memories of the years of the catechism or not match up with the script. And then the relationship of Moses with God can not leave you indifferent saw the boldness of choice: Scott from a face to God, God is a child, yeah, God is an irreverent child (the eleven British Isaac Andrews) from the look sharp, decisive, and sometimes disturbing and incomprehensible (may God punish the people of Egypt by sending the plagues?), A God who does discuss, a God you do not expect.The figure of Moses is compelling, and it'is told his story, his sense of belonging to the Egyptian people, the people who will be punished by his God, the people who will have to leave to fulfill the divine mission and save the people Jews. Moses emerges in the battle of their own faith, discover what it means Israel (the man who struggles with God); a faith between light and shadow, certainties and discouragements. Gen. Moses, fighting multiple battles: from research / acceptance of their identity (but not more Egyptian Jews), the reception of the call of the Boss (go and free your people, that until recently did not know it was yours), to ' abandonment of his family, a series of acts of custody. After all this, walking in the Red Sea and divide the waters ... it's a joke!",Exodus - Gods and Kings
691,user-247-505363,Big Disappointment,4,9 December 2015,"The movie ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is based of one of the books in the Old Testament called Exodus. It follows the life of Moses and how he lead the Hebrews to freedom. Moses and Ramses were brothers but that ended when Moses found out that he was a Hebrew and was sent to exile by Ramses. After that he lives a quiet life, where he gets married and has a child. He is told by god to go back to Egypt, save the Hebrews and take them back to the ""promised land"" called Canaan. After the ten plagues Moses finally takes the Hebrews back to their homeland of Canaan. Lots of people went to this movie with high hopes, considering that Ridley Scott has directed several famous movies and Christian Bale is known for his good acting. For the first ten minutes or so you were left stunned by the fantastic visuals and cinematography. These positives could be viewed through the details on things such as the some of the slaves' houses and Egyptian monuments. Nevertheless besides the cinematography there wasn't much going for it. Most of the actors lacked emotions. In fact Christian Bale was the only actor in the movie that gave a decent performance. There are a few memorable scenes, but at the same time there's a huge lack of writing, script and overall just a good story. When people went to watch the movie they were expecting some great acting, emotion and story. But instead the film makers put lots of pointless action scenes and not enough emotions from the characters. There should have been more of the biblical story but they were left with something of a disappointment as there isn't much that the two have in common. Viewers were disappointed by the plagues as people went into the movie expecting some great and harrowing scenes. But instead it appeared as if we were watching a CGI montage rather than a truly terrifying moment. My biggest disappointment in terms of casting is Joel Edgerton as Ramses the Great. He should have made a great villain, but in the end it seemed like he could barely convince us of his role. Another complaint I have is about how slow the movie is overall. To be fair this movie would have been a lot better with some emotion that would have kept the audience on the edge of their seats. But instead we were left with a really slow story that probably made some people fall asleep. Overall it's a visually stunning movie, but it is also an emotionless one. Now let's compare it to the actual story itself. The title itself throws viewers off as in the Bible there's only one god yet the title is ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"". Even though it's true that Moses and Ramses grew up together, the movie shows Moses saving Ramses in war but that never happened in the true story. A big part of the first act of the movie is dedicated to Moses finding out that he is Hebrew, but in the Bible he already knew that he is Hebrew. Another disappointing scene in the movie is the burning bush. People were looking forward to the dialogue between god and Moses, but apparently he just gets in the head and is convinced by his wife that it's all a dream. On top of that they showed that all of the plagues somehow came from crocodiles eating 10 men or so. While in the Bible Aaron (the older brother of Moses) used his staff to change the water into blood. There also isn't any effort in conveying that the Hebrew people are safe as this happens. Probably my biggest disappointment in the story is that there actually isn't a parting of the red sea! The water just decides the recede after Moses throws his sword in the water. You don't actually see the possible miraculous splitting of the sea, and the amazing visual effects it would have lead to. After that the movie quickly ends and we don't see anything from the 40 year journey In the end this movie is a huge disappointment and it didn't even follow much of the story from the bible.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
692,kulpreetchadha,Outstanding Effects,9,26 February 2015,"I am not too sure about the storyline, since i think its a fantasy. However, given that its a fantasy, Ridley Scott has , as usual, made a stunner. The Tsunami scene and the chase of Bale in the end is worth all the money you can spend on a movie. Again, not convinced entirely with the story, but within the story, OUTSTANDING Visuals and super acting.It also raises important issues like Slavery in those times. And we all know that in many parts of the world , slavery was a damn reality. Kings , in those times, considered themselves as Gods, and i was impressed by the Director to put a Grey shade on King character, showing , how Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It was a reminder to current day politicians to know that Moses like Men (AK), can challenge and destroy corrupt and inhuman politicians.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

I have no idea if the story is accurate but it's very well told with very impressive visuals. Even with my knowledge of special effects, I kept asking myself how did they do that? It's one of a few movies that I'd actually like to watch a how it was made documentary on it. The details, the flow, the acting, the creative visuals, it's all pretty awesome. This is one entertaining and very well crafted movie. Of course, you have to like the genre. I'm not religious so I don't know and don't care if it's accurate.

It did not come close to following the biblical account. I'm not even religious and was put off by this movie, if you'd call it that. Big names with small parts; I wonder if the asked to be cut out.

They haven take God out of a story that is completely about God. Seriously, this is like taking Jackie Robinson out of a story about Jackie Robinson. I understand artistic liberties. This is not an example of artistic liberty. It is a blatant, shameless attempt to remove God from history by making Moses the ""victim"" of head trauma, the plagues coincidental, and still no ""other-than-God"" explanation for the departing of the Red Sea, though we are supposed to accept that Moses was completely shocked that it happened. My advice - read the book. In every movie based on a book I have ever seen, the book is always better. This certainly is no exception. Besides, reading is better for you.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
698,efuapraise,Beyond disappointing (contains spoilers),1,10 March 2015,"I am completely disturbed, disgusted and annoyed by the distortion of a great biblical story. This is a story that people all over the world, Christians and non-Christians know about. I saw the trailer of this movie and had some hope that it would be better that the Noah movie which was the most awful movie I watched last year but Exodus: Gods and Kings really took the cake. It surpassed my expectation of how horrible it would be. Before I go on to state the many disappointments of this movie, I just want to warn anyone who has not seen this movie to just not bother especially if you're a Christian and if you have or know any children that want to see this movie please discourage them from witnessing such evil. I grew up watching biblical stories and I know that sometimes they get some facts wrong but this wasn't the case here. The makers of this movie took a biblical epic story and twisted it beyond recognition. In fact I am convinced that this movie was not really about Moses, they even kept calling him Mosher at some point and I have no idea why. The most vital detail of the story which was the parting of the red sea was completely left out but beyond the distortion of the original story, the movie itself was a very bad production. The plot had no buildup, no direction and no excitement. I mean after Moses threatened Ramses to negotiate on treating them equally as the Egyptians, all of a sudden we see Moses training people to fight which makes so sense because they actually never have to fight the Egyptians. Then the plagues start with no warning, nothing - they just start happening one after the other. The Moses in this movie is such a coward that he can't ask Ramses face to face to let his people go, he sends a horse with blood written on its side. Finally, Ramses says the Israelites should go and they don't even look happy to leave and from then on everything is just a mess. As a viewer I didn't even know what was going on most of this movie, the Isrealites were supposed to be slaves building Pharaoh's city but they are not doing any slave thing, they are just sitting around waiting for Moses to give them orders which again makes absolutely no sense. The Pharoah was such a softy that if the people wanted to just leave in the middle of the night without warning, they could have and there's nothing he could have done. Bottom line is this movie was the biggest flop of all time and by far the most offensive movie I have ever seen. It is only God that can judge the makers of this movie because it is only with evil minds that a person can set out to deceive people like this. I have never written a review for anything before but I just had to do this. I even had to go back and watch The Ten Commandments (1956) to remember the true story of Moses and remind myself that there were actually good filmmakers in this world. Filmmakers who respect the story that they are telling and do it justice by staying true to its message. God bless Cecil B. DeMille for giving us a classic for all time.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
699,pferreira_pt,Why such bad reviews when... Gladiator won an Oscar?,7,10 March 2015,"I watched this movie with very low expectations, based on the discouraging reviews i've met. I was expecting something as bad or even worse as Noah. At this point i must leave a disclaimer: I believe in God, i'm catholic and i've attended a catholic school during 10 years and although i'm not a ""sunday mass"" attendant i have faith.(spoiler alert)Based on the previous disclaimer i expected religious beliefs and specially the lack of tolerance that some of my ""faith colleagues"" apply every time one of these movies comes across. Of course having Moses writing his own commandments is a big stone in the sock of less tolerant believers, even if this is just a movie. So let's leave the religious criticism aside since what i don't get is why such a bad cinematographic review in the first place.Yes moses doesn't create the kind of sympathy other Scott's characters have done in the past (should he really?). Yes the Ramses casting could probably be better. But as an epic movie at the end of the day is this movie that bad? I don't believe so, specially remembering some epic movies from the past with plastic characters (and actors) still regarded today as classics and masterpieces. I even think the movie tried (with success) to become watchable for both believers and non-believers, addressing some issues (eg. the plagues) in a way that the movie wouldn't become a comic relief which only ppl who take the texts too literally would regard in a serious way.I like Ridley Scott epics for what they are: fun epic movies to watch. Probably the problem in the first place was having a great(but obviously not Oscar material) movie as Gladiator taking awards like best picture and best actor (?!) awards, taking epic movies to an (unjustified) level where they should not be.So to people who like epics, religious or not, and take them for what they really are.. Exodus is pretty OK. It's not the best but it's surely not as bad as being portrayed by a mix of religious literals and over demanding Scott fans.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Awful with Great special effects They managed to successfully massacred the story and it took them a good two and an half hours to do so.

They have put together a cheesy story with big actors and actresses that do nothing! It does not need an expert to know that the production of such films in these ways do not have any artistic or financial gain. Why then bother with it? The only reason comes to my mind is this; The non-Jewish sector of the business somehow tries to send a message to the Jewish governing body: Do not mess with us other wise we will mess with you through your weak and soft point. So far we have at least four movies based on the story with great actors and fantastic special effects that were available at the time of production.

702,tamara-267-485234,NOT a Biblical account,1,19 March 2015,"I had heard this was a good movie, and from a cinematography perspective, I suppose it was, but NOT from a Biblical perspective. The movie didn't just deviate from scripture -- taking some creative license, but rather made a mockery of it. God was basically turned into an opinionated child, Moses became a terrorist in his approach and the story lacked the guts and the glory of the real story.Points to note: 1. Moses killed a guard who was beating a Hebrew -- not two guards in the street. 2. Moses fled when he realized that the Hebrews knew he killed the guard and Pharaoh wanted to kill him. He FLED to Midian -- he was NOT exiled. 3. Pharaoh's daughter sent one of her maids to get Moses from the water and she stated that he was one of the Hebrew children, so she was NOT the only person who knew (besides Miriam). 4. Miriam was not hired as his nurse, she offered to find a nurse for him (who ended up being his mother). He was taken back to his mother until he was weaned. Then he was brought to the palace to grow up with Ramses. 5. Moses was not encased in mud and rock, with a broken leg, when the burning bush event happened. He was on his feet. God called to him from the bush and told him to removed his sandals for he was standing on holy ground. He told him that He'd heard the cries of His people and of his desire to free them. He told Moses His plan to take them to a land of milk and honey. He spoke with Moses at length. There was much more depth to this than was depicted. The picture of God that was created was almost creepy or even frightful. I was surprised how far they went to make Him the scenes with God that way. 6. There was no sword in Moses' hand when he approached Pharaoh... only a staff. A staff that would turn into a serpent and gobble up the magicians snakes. A sign from God. He didn't need a sword, nor did he need to create an army to fight, as depicted. The exodus was not gained by force of man's hand, but rather power of God.These are just a few of the early scenes. In short, this is just another travesty of Hollywood (just like ""Noah""). My husband and I couldn't even stand to watch the whole thing. What a waste of time and money.I wish the people in Hollywood would try to follow the scriptures when creating Biblical movies. It seems their desire is to twist the characters into something they're not, and create a picture of God that is completely incorrect. Perhaps create a picture of Israel that is incorrect even. But they do NOT seem to be interested in creating a good movie with the REAL story.It's very sad. If you want to know the real story, read the book of Exodus. It's the second book in the Bible.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Moses went to Ramses and told him to let his people go or the river would turn to blood, but not because of crocodiles or alligators (whatever the case may be), because he touched his staff to the water's edge. When the people were not freed he then went back and told of the next plague and the next. Where's the staff that turned into a serpent? And gum???

709,korzjsk,Ten Commandments was better,7,28 March 2015,"Warning. Spoilers.ABOUT THE COMMENTS THAT ACTORS PLAYING EGYPTIANS SHOUDN'T BE WHITEIt's true that the Egyptians were not white. But it's false to say that they were black. The Egyptians on their wall paintings, depicted themselves as red. Other Africans (Nubians) were represented as black with negroid features. Semites and Libyans were represented as lighter in color. There were black ruling dynasties (the 25th dynasty) in Egypt, but a long time after the Exodus period. These black rulers were not native to Egypt, they were Kushite conquerors.In any case, I understand the objection. Perhaps the casting directors should have employed Egyptians (not Arabs, who are Semites and therefore white). The problem is that the producers probably needed some big names to attract audiences and other than Omar Sharif who is 82, I don't know of any Egyptian actors who would be instantly recognizable to American audiences.As for black actors playing Egyptians, why not? Denzel Washington would make a great Seti. Blair Underwood would make a beautiful Moses. Jamie Fox would serve as Ramses. But, historically speaking, these guys would be no more appropriate for playing Egyptians than white actors.AESTHETICSThis contemporary telling of the Moses tale pales in comparison to The Ten Commandments. It has no compelling love story (Moses and Nefretiri), no rejection of a loving adoptive father (Seti I), no Dathan and Lilia-Joshua subplot, no disembodied thundering god. And the color palette is quite dark in contrast to the brilliant hues of The Ten Commandments. The monumental musical score of the 1956 production is not matched by the Exodus score, which is intimate. All in all, Exodus is a more gloomy movie.Nevertheless, the CGI in Exodus is awesome. The opening battle scene is impressive. Especially the archers firing their arrows as the Egyptian chariots race toward the enemy at breakneck speed. The external shot of pharaoh's palace, the long shot of Moses traversing the hypostyle hall and pharaoh's apartment are powerful in their scale and detail. The funeral at the mortuary temple at Abu Simbel is visually stunning (if historically fanciful). A lot of loving effort went into these shots. Scott is certainly going for realism.Even though realism is one objective, Scott's films are artsy. As he does in A Good Year, where he uses a lovely rich blue in his depictions of London to contrast the warm Amber of Provence, Scott employs the same technique in the governor's palace in Goshen. He does it to set a mood. That mood, although beautiful, is imperial, powerful but not warm or nurturing. Look at Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, Prometheus. The sun is rarely a direct source of light; it almost always obliquely illuminates shadowy spaces.ON WHETHER THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IS MORE TRUE TO SCRIPTURE THAN EXODUS.I can see why many people interested in scripture, would be disappointed with Exodus. If you view The Ten Commandments, you will see how the entire film is centered on the ancient texts, beginning with the title itself. In the exposition, Cecil B. De Mille reads from Genesis, then from Exodus. There is no question that the escape of the Hebrews from Egypt actually occurred and that this act was divinely inspired. Hence the copy in the exposition which says that the audience will ""...make a pilgrimage over the very ground that Moses trod more than three thousand years ago."" De Mille follows this with a burning bush, rods turning into snakes, a pillar of fire, the parting of the sea, and the fiery finger of God burning the law into hard granite. Watching The Ten Commandments is not just entertainment. It is a sacred act. Exodus, dispenses with all of this. There is no reading from scripture, no privileging of the Bible. The Ten Commandments begins with Genesis and the creation of light. Exodus begins with Seti and his war council discussing the Hittite deployment at Kadesh. In The Ten Commandments Moses is a prophet, in Exodus he is a skeptic. The divine is not completely missing from Exodus. But what little there is presents in the form of a young boy. But even this figure is fraught with ambiguity; Zephora explains that all of Moses' visions of the divine are a result of a blow to the head. She thinks Moses is hallucinating. In Exodus, God does not command, he does not thunder. He discusses, debates, and persuades.In Exodus, with the exception of the last plague during which the first-born die and the scattered cries of anguished mothers meld into a wailing wave of grief, we miss the passion. In The Ten Commandments, what can be more passionate than Nefretiri's all consuming love for Moses? Or Lilia's shame in giving herself to Dathan in order to save Joshua's life? Or Seti's palpable suffering from the grievous wound inflicted by Moses' betrayal? What can be more grand than the kettle drum roll and deep rumble of the tubas accompanying the Paramount Pictures logo, a blood red Matterhorn, followed by an epic brass fanfare and an orchestra in full voice playing the overture as the intro credits roll? If there was ever a doubt expressed in The Ten Commandments, it ended on the cutting room floor.Exodus is less assertive, more psychological, and, in some instances, more faithful to the biblical text than The Ten Commandments. The film is worth seeing, if only to contrast it with the vision offered by Cecil B. De Mille at a time of greater American optimism and certainty.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Don't waste your money and time, go watch prince of Egypt instead, at least it's more entertaining and accurate than this. This movie shouldn't even be called exodus at all. All the great moments we know of and expect to see in a movie about the biblical exodus are not here. The story is completely in accurate and portraying God as a small child was just utterly annoying and inconceivable. I didn't get to complete the whole movie as I was utterly dismayed, not to mention that it's just plain boring. I didn't like the Noah movie either but this movie dwarfs the issues in the Noah movie a 100 times over.

Once they showed the Nile turning red due to crocodiles attacking people, I felt it went down hill from there. The effects were good. The acting was good. The roles were good, except the insult of portraying God as a mean little boy. I did not understand why they would have inserted things like the small boy as God or having Moses write the commandments. Or Moses fighting with and hiding from the king or taking the liberated Hebrews to his family. I really wish they would have followed the real story in the bible it was a much better story and the true one. I do think it was a step up from Noah, which I couldn't finish watching. I felt as though they were making a mockery of the Bible. I wonder if they would be bold enough to take such liberties with a story in the Koran. I believe you should stick to fiction or tell the real story from the bible. It's been written for a long long time and has never changed will never change.

714,dajinelo,A Biblical movie with massive effects but with huge inaccuracy,3,22 April 2015,"First off, given the technology we have nowadays, Biblical stories crafted into a movie can be really impressive, given the fact that such stories contain a lot of supernatural events and miracles.I am a visual effects enthusiast, so I can say that the movie portrayed the story as realistic as possible.But the thing disappointed me the most is its inaccuracy. A lot of scenes went out of context.1) All throughout the movie, God showed Himself as a child. But the book where the story came from isn't saying anything that He came down to Earth ""as a child"". The burning bush was God Himself already at the first place. 2) As the Red Sea was cut in half, while He ""stretched his walking stick (Exo. 14: 16). No sword. 3) No walls of water was shown all throughout the Crossing at the Red Sea. Except for the time when the Egyptian army came across the sea floor, and the waters came back. No visible walls of water here. 4) No accident was supposed to happen as the Egyptian army crossed the mountainside. The only disaster that happened to them, according to the Bible, was the time the Red Sea waters consumed them as Moses stretches His arms. And the chariots' wheels got stuck on the way. No landslides. No armies falling on the cliff. 5) The Lord wrote the Ten Commandments, not Moses. (Deut. 9:10) while Mount Sinai was covered in cloud, which signifies God presence. Again, the Bible says nothing that Moses engraved the commandments on stone tablets, but it says God did. This is the word of God. It has been proved by history and science itself. No doubt about it. At least the movie should have been portrayed with near-complete accuracy together with the stunning graphics, and the movie should have gained a lot of positive reviews from Christian viewers. It is a grave sin to deduct or add something from the words of God itself/what God Himself told the people through His words. (Rev. 22:18-19) ""I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book."" And by what they did on this movie, they are committing that sin. God's word should have been honored, not the glory or the sake of the movie budget or the entertainment business itself.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
715,ilvsv,Don't Waste Your Time,1,25 April 2015,"So we watched Exodus: Gods and Kings last night. I've got to say it was the most disappointing & worst show I've seen in quite a few years. If possible I would give it zero stars or negative stars. Yes, I know it was a Hollywood production; however, there have been quite a few of those that were actually great movies. Spoiler alerts if you want to waste 2 ½ hours of your life on a work of fiction. They took God out of the story-No, 'Let My People Go', no questions or warnings to Pharaoh. No staff which Aaron used as directed by God. You've got a petulant Moses that constantly argues with 'God' who is portrayed by a young boy with a bad attitude and vengeance against everyone. They keep Moses as more of a general – who trains the slaves to fight (ala Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) – rather than the Prophet he was that turned to God for direction in all his doings. The first signs when Moses went to Pharaoh, the staff turning into a serpent-totally not shown. Aaron as the spokesman-nope, in this farce Moses takes care of everything himself. They also took the plagues that were caused by God, thru his prophet, into just mishaps that happened to fit the plagues. The three days of darkness-only the Israelites had light in their dwellings- the Egyptians had no light at all for those three days – Hollywood changed the story again, let's give light to everyone. Cloud by day and pillar of fire by night to lead the Israelites where they needed to go- nope, let's change it to Moses deciding all by himself which way to go. Crossing the Red Sea on DRY ground, again changed-let's start wading up past our waists in the water, also lets have Moses stay behind and almost get drowned as well. All the Egyptians that followed into the sea were drowned and not one remained- changed again that some survived and washed up on shore. The Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses while on Mount Sinai – engraved on stone tablets, by the finger of God; the movie decided to again take God out of the equation and had Moses engrave them himself. If this had been portrayed as just a fiction story and not an occurrence in the Bible, it would have been an OK movie. However, when the storyline and script are already outlined for you, how and what exactly occurred, it's pretty darn stupid to ignore it all. It seems to be an unfortunate attitude in this day and age that God is being taken out of all that happens and has happened and are giving tribute to man as the one who did it. This follows along the lines of other things in history – like saying that the Holocaust atrocities never happened, it's just a story something that the Jews made up; that slavery and the atrocities there never happened. Just because man changes the history books and stories doesn't change the facts.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

As you know the story you anticipate and are excited how the effects will be shown and created but to be fair I was utterly disappointed,sorry! A story that is so old is dishonored and spoiled by a poor interpretation! No one I spoke to actually finished watching it other than the party we went with to see at the cinema. I am not even convinced the acting was great even the legendary Ben Kingsley did not get a chance to shine in his usual way.

Also when the red sea parted....it was clearly on bare and wet ground. They were knee deep due to the winds blowing in this one. Also portraying God to be a child clearly is a mockery of who He really is. We should have childlike faith, but He is definitely not a child.

Just imagine that Ridley Scott decided to make a movie about the Civil Rights era, cast Leonardo DiCaprio as MLK, Jr., Idris Elba as JFK, made the KKK a minority ""social"" group bent on ""helping"" minorities, changed actual historical facts and just took a script written by the smartest baboons he could find and presented it to the public. That is exactly what he did with this huge steaming pile of horse manure. Not only do the main characters look NOTHING like any Hebrew, Jew or African I or anyone else has ever seen (What? Was Idris Elba on another planet when casting for Ramses or Moses started?) but he also takes liberties with the Bible. Instead of Moses Mother putting him in the basket and the Princess finding him as the Bible relates, his sister Miriam is the one who brought him to the Princess as a ""gift"". Instead of a staff, Moses has a sword. The staff doesn't show up until the VERY end. Instead of the burning bush speaking to Moses, a little boy who sits BESIDE the burning bush and is not ANYWHERE in the book of Exodus is the ""voice of God"" and meets regularly with Moses to bring him up to speed on what God is going to do. Instead of Zipporah being portrayed as she was: an Ethiopian, she is portrayed by some Colombian chick and is lighter than any Ethiopian I've ever laid eyes on. EVER. And where the heck do CROCODILES ever show up in the story of the Ten Plagues? Not in ANY Bible I've ever seen. All Ridley had to do was to add ONE sentence: ""Based on the story of Moses and the Book of Exodus as written in the Holy Bible"". That's ALL he had to do. But he did not. As a result, we are left with this hodge podge of a fictional fairy tale. Do not waste 150 minutes of your life that you can't get back as we did watching this. It will only tick you off if you're a Christian or history scholar and make you laugh your behind off it you're not. The Ten Commandments was more accurate than THIS crap. Just WOW!

722,bl-37282,Boring,3,4 October 2015,"Ridley Scott's tendency for cliché can traced back to his earlier work such as Blade Runner: the China Town screen in the very advanced future society; the attempt to portrait Moses as a regal and fierce general who saved Pharoah's son and God's impatient about the passage of time -- so laughable as time only has meanings to mortals. What does 400 years mean to a omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient God who had created an universe billions and billions of years ago? The director's imagination is so limited and bounded limited by his own experience and perception that the movie is nothing but a comic book version of a biblical story with superfluous special effects. Hollywood creativeness is as much as an oxymoron as the superhero comic book authors whose only imagination is turn humans into animals.

But I was always curious about how bad it could be... Should not be worse than Man of God, surely? So after I saw our HBO subscription has this for free, I started watching. OK. Me assuming it not being worse than Man of God... WRONG! I literally had to go back and read the first parts of the real Exodus in the Bible to ""bleach my mind"", if I can choose my own words. Everything just diverts so badly from the Bible that in the middle of the movie, I just feel that watching this is blasphemous. I mean, if the screen writer and director would stick to the Bible, it would be just a wonderful movie even to use the original biblical words and conversations! So there is even no need to have a screen writer. If you really read the biblical Exodus, it's like an adventure storybook. SO, diverting this from the Bible, but uses the Bible's book title, ideas, and protagonists' names would actually be plagiarizing... If you exclude the fact that the Bible is so old now that it is in the public domain. That's probably the only thing that's keeping the copyright police to come arrest Ridly. And this movie is just historically wrong from beginning to the end. Even if you are not a believer of God, just read the ""goof"" part of this IMDb entry, and you would see that the director pays no respect of historical facts, which even the craziest Chinese drama would try to pay attention to. First of all, the pharaoh. I don't think Remesus actually existed; it's just a made-up name. Historically, Moses would have gone through 4 pharaohs and 1 queen until he led the Israelites out of Egypt, with the actual exodus pharaoh being Amenhotep II. So who is this Remesus dude? Secondly, I can't believe it had to take Moses most of his juvenile years to think he was actually Egyptian... The Bible says he was brought up by his biological mother, a Hebrew, as nanny, thus knowing and fearing God from the very beginning. If really as the movie said, he didn't know until Nun, father of Joshua, told him, he should have been a ruthless Egyptian prince like Remuses is. Where did his compassion for Hebrew people come from? This is a logical error, just as Moses' adoptive mother, the princess said: none of the court would have spoken up for a Hebrew. So why would have Moses, if he had no clue who he was prior to Nun's conversation? Thirdly, the plagues. The movie is trying to make all God's work seem like a natural disaster (until, of course, the death of the newborn when it couldn't explain by natural forces anymore), so the plague of water turning into blood was actually started by thousands of crocodiles killing a boat with like, 5 men. Never heard of anything like that in my life! I'd rather believe in one of the Pharaoh's officials in saying that it was the clay in the Nile being stirred by those huge crocodiles!There are so many other scenes that made me cringe: how Moses saved Ramesus, how God is this little boy throwing tantrum, how Moses was sinking in a mudslide when he saw the burning bush, how the role of Aaron, the speaker for Moses appointed by God, is almost non-existent, how Moses didn't know what he was talking about when instructing about the lamb blood for Passover, how there was NO PARTING OF THE RED SEA, and how Moses was swallowed by the Red Sea when God was closing it etc. etc. I cannot even count. And that's why I need to bleach my brain after the movie. REALLY, I do not, and cannot comprehend the director's purpose in making this film as is. If it was titled some other, I would have saved myself for this lengthy review and just say screw it, it was just a historically incorrect film. But this was title EXODUS, in association with the Bible, with my God. So I have to write something. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that the entire crew, especially the director, is demon-possessed when making this movie, for I mistook that little boy (God) as Satan the first time I saw him.

728,sbcardinals,Exodus: The Movie's Worse Than the Book... Again,2,5 March 2016,"First, let me save you a few hours of your life and tell you that ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" was one of the worst movies of 2015. After watching the first 58 minutes of the movie, I had to turn it off. Let me put it this way... It seems to me as if the script writers had never actually held a Bible before. Yes, the first 10 minutes of the film was fairly accurate, where Moses and Ramses are displayed as brothers and close companions. But soon after, the movie took a few drastic changes, or rather a few major leaps. Shortly after Moses arrives to what seems to be an underground Hebrew gathering, Moses first hears the story of how he really obtained a role in Pharaoh's palace (Placed in a basket in the Nile River by his mother in order to keep him alive from Pharaoh, found by the Pharaoh's daughter, and raised alongside of Ramses), which was presented surprisingly accurate. One thing leads to another and Moses is exiled because Ramses discovers he is truly Hebrew. According to the Bible, Moses is not banished, but flees due to being a wanted man after killing a slave master. In Exodus: G&K, Moses eventually returns to the palace only to revolt against Pharaoh. I decided to turn my TV off as soon as I saw a very angry Moses set Egyptian soldiers on fire. Apparently Christian Bale thought that the best way to convince Pharaoh to let his people go was to train a slave army and fight against him. Whether you are Christian or not doesn't matter in this case. When writing a movie based off of the main character of a famous historical event, use primary sources. The one star goes to CBale and the fact that the amount of gore and explicit content were kept to a minimum, if any at all. Overall, ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is a musn't watch for all looking to watch a movie that follows the Biblical storyline of Exodus.",Exodus - Gods and Kings

Why would they do that? A more appropriate title would have been: ""The Legend of Moses: A Skeptics Rebuttal."" The only possible redeeming factor is that it was so different from Cecil B. DeMille's Ten Commandments (1956) that some people will search the Torah or Bible to compare with the original account. I found the movie Exodus (2014) to be shockingly deviant and irreverent.

736,davidlungtau,What is this movie?,1,10 April 2020,Is this movie any related to the biblical stories of Moses? If yes...then the director has to do more readings.,Exodus - Gods and Kings
737,sarahmfrederick,Disappointing,2,9 April 2021,"I mean ... I watched the whole thing just to see what other BS was inserted into this well known story. Above all, the book of Exodus is a story of God's love and mercy for His people shown through His use an imperfect man to perform His miracles. You will find none of that in this mockery of God and those of us whose faith is in Him.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
738,kamelhamdi,Fake,1,12 August 2021,"Fake is the Only thing i can think about, This Movie is far far away from truth, not even a single scene and a lot of the true story isn't even included like Moses miracles with the magician and with his Stick and the sea and his hand changing color and a lot More.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
739,jesseforney-68735,Oh myyy.....,2,29 October 2021,Not since John Wayne as Genghis Khan have I seen a more inappropriate cast. What distresses me the most is that so many Hollywood big names like Bale and Weaver lent themselves to this. A rare miss for Riidley Scott. The only thing justifying the 2 stars is the visual effects were good.,Exodus - Gods and Kings
740,blackdove28,"Good story, wrong cast.",1,3 August 2016,"Here we are again with one of the biggest case of cultural appropriation in human history. Ancient Egyptians were African and Black, deal with it. That goes for the political and the religious authorities too. Most of them, looked like people from countries that we call today Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. Not Arabic, not Asian and definitely not White. Lol. I hope one day all those historical film makers will be smart (and honest) enough to do researches and read the true history of Egyptian civilization before casting white people for leading roles and black people for only ""low class"" roles. Dear White/Arabic/Asian film makers, please, stop the propaganda and give credit where credit is due.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
741,kdyer-22490,just. plain. silly.,2,6 September 2020,"An uncommonly stupid portrayal of what is-as the movie's title and billboard explicitly declare-supposed to be the biblical account of the Hebrews' exodus from Egypt and into the 'Promised Land.' I didn't expect an authentic account of the story. I didn't even expect a loosely-based-on telling of the story. But this film is so off the mark, in every way possible, that it has forfeited any rational and defensible right to name itself after the Bible book it is supposed to portray.I'm no scholar, so I'm not sure how much extra-biblical chronicling of the Exodus exists from antiquity; but unless there is other source material out there that is strangely and perversely contrary to the biblical account, this film certainly ranks among the most perverted presentations of supposed 'history' in the annals of motion pictures.Others have done a fine job of pointing out the silliness in the characters and plot, so there is no need for me to recite those absurdities. Suffice to say that if you're looking for some decent special effects complementing inane content, you might suffer it well.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
742,rdeyeking,Why dilute a good thing?!,1,17 March 2018,I've read the bible narrative and other books that parallel the biblical account and I was hoping to see the updated modern version of the 1965 movie The 10 Commandments. But that was soon dashed to the ground as Ridley Scott seemed to make great effort to corrupt the story with additions so wildly off based like depicting God as an angry vindictive child. I was almost shocked that kept the plagues in the movie or that the Hebrews were even let go by Ramses. Yeah it's one of those type of movies that takes such creative freedom with the story that the True account known by so many is lost sight of. An opportunity was missed by Mr.Scott to make a great classic if he just stayed with the story as told in scripture. I would never recommend anyone waste 2 hrs of their life sitting and watching this story cause not only has it been falsified but the acting in it is bland and sadly one dimensional.,Exodus - Gods and Kings
743,mariewhite-22418,What??,3,28 September 2018,As far as special effects go and action that was good. But it strayed far from the story of Moses and God. If you are going to tell a story than stay accurate with how it is already known. To me it made it seem like they were trying to portray God as vegenful and unmerciful and Moses as this unhearted man that had no real faith. When truth God gave them a choice each time and they turned away.,Exodus - Gods and Kings

745,slotenmakerdenhash,Beyond Ridiculous,1,28 November 2018,"The director has really gone completely overboard on this one, reinventing the entire story and making it positively more ridiculous and incredible than it already was in the Old Testament version. One cannot help but think that this movie was actually conceived as a bizarre form of propaganda to bolster failing support for the Jewish state. (I am allowed to say that, I am Jewish). As (Jewish) historian Simon Shama points out in his recent book dealing with the history of the Jews, Jewish life in ancient Egypt was not as unpleasant as it has been portrayed. Plus, the construction of the pyramids and even more elaborate sculptures and buildings is hardly the work of an unskilled workforce. The notion that the Jews were slaves in Egypt and that they built all the beautiful stuff is patently absurd. Yet that is precisely the impression this film leaves us with.It is one thing to create a work of artistic imagination and something other to criticise or oppose common beliefs. This film accomplishes neither, it simply blows everything utterly out of proportion in a way that leaves one feeling the director should have stayed with the incredible - aliens -, rather than mess with something he and those funding him obviously know absolutely nothing about.The film is patently racist in its portrayal of the Egyptians as primitives and cruel. It lacks in imagination where it comes to attempting to understand the politics and economics underpinning its supposed scenario.Worst of all, with the current rise of anti-intellectualism and hardcore Christian fundamentalism in the USA, this film may reach and young and impressionable audience of youngsters whose education has left them ill equipped to recognise its propagandistic value.",Exodus - Gods and Kings
