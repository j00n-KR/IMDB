0,SnoopyStyle,solid woman-in-peril,7,20 March 2021,"Jessica (Jules Willcox) loads up her U-haul and heads for the open roads. She lost her husband and continues to be haunted. She's leaving the city and her life behind. She keeps encountering a man (Marc Menchaca) driving an SUV. She's suspicious and indeed, he is stalking her.This could have been more exploitative. He tells her to get undress but she never does. It's still not far away from its B-movie sensibilities. Her escape is too easy. That trick is so commonly used that it has become a trope. Also it's too convenient for the man to search for Jessica in exactly the right direction. Now if she had screamed before then, it would make much more sense. All in all, this is a fine woman-in-peril movie. The river swim actually looks dangerous. The water looks very rough. Most of this works well.",Alone
1,kosmasp,But not really,6,8 July 2021,"Why are women afraid if they travel alone? Especially when a man only appears to be friendly towards them ... if you think that here (and the movie sort of tries to give you reason to), you could not be more wrong. There is a line between coincidence and dangerous obsession.Not a thin line, although I reckon for some it is blurry. Anyway, the main character here has it tough ... and while the first minutes may feel like a drag, they are here to establish, that she will not have anyone to lean on, to fall back on. She is ... ""alone"". But is she also easy prey? Well that may be a different story.There are things happening though, that may make you get mad at her (behaviour wise), but it all can be explained and we all react differently to pressure and danger ... also the movie has to happen and continue to happen - because the way she reacts in the first half of the movie makes more than sense to me. You don't want to mess around with someone you don't know ...",Alone
2,westsideschl,Seen Before Script,7,13 February 2021,"The usual cheap, overdone opening scene of overhead & road level views of car on country road. A remake of the Swedish 2011, ""Försvunnen"".
A script done, with variations, many times before. Vulnerable youngish single female is pursued/terrorized by seemingly everyday family type guy. Female makes the usual mistakes of either non-action or poor decision action (enough for 90min). The usual no cell service or not convincing asking for help. The usual wounded to make her even more sympathetic. Contrary to all behaviors prior, still may have one out-of-character last fight in her. Nevertheless, despite all the redundancy, the storyline resonates with our nature & we still watch.",Alone

4,jtindahouse,Seriously tense,9,23 September 2020,"Usually when I don't know any of the cast for a film, and I've heard nothing about it before seeing it, the film doesn't turn out to be all that great. So for those reasons alone my hopes weren't particularly high for 'Alone'. Boy, was I wrong. This film was a blast from start to finish. I kept thinking to myself, there has to be a weak segment of this movie coming up - surely? Nope, it never came. This is a hidden gem of a film.I loved the lead character 'Jessica'. She was likeable, smart, never did dumb things, had great instincts and was easy to root for. A perfect lead for a horror/thriller film. Marc Menchaca as 'Man' was also brilliant in this film. He never overdid anything, but was extremely watchable when he was on screen. He and Jules Willcox are a large part of making this film as good as it is.This is also a very well directed film. A lot of the action sequences are perfectly filmed to create maximum suspense. I was on the edge of my seat from go to whoa in this one. The film finds a perfect balance between keeping the action going, and never making things unbelievable or far-fetched. I had a great time with 'Alone' and would highly recommend people check it out.",Alone
5,stevendbeard,Stay Away From Strangers,6,19 September 2020,"I saw ""Alone"", starring Jules Willcox-Dirty John_tv, Snake & Mongoose; Marc Menchaca-Ozark_tv, Homeland_tv and Anthony Heald-X_Men:The Last Stand, The Silence of the Lambs.
This movie is a remake of a 2011 Swedish movie called 'Gone'. Jules plays a recently widowed woman that is moving away from the city to the country to help soothe her pain. She has a few run ins with Marc-innocently at first-but she soon decides that he is probably stalking her. Sure enough, he drugs and kidnaps her and she wakes up inside an isolated cabin in the woods. She escapes and is in the process of trying to get someone to help her when she runs into Anthony, a hunter. Can he save her? Does she trust him? Or should she just stay away from any strangers, altogether in the future, that is, if she survives this encounter? It's a pretty standard movie, which was made in 2018-I read the end credits-so it's 2 years old. Oh yeah, maybe it's just me but Marc Menchaca reminded me of Jason Sudeikis with a bushy mustache.
It wasn't rated but it contained violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes.
I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",Alone
6,jimbo-53-186511,Minimalist thriller that mostly succeeds,6,28 September 2021,"A recently widowed woman is travelling across America when she finds herself repeatedly bumping into a mysterious man. However, it soon transpires that these meetings are not coincidental and the woman (Jessica) ends up being kidnapped and held hostage by this man. Jessica manages to escape, but this merely becomes the start of her problems...With Alone what you effectively have is a good old-fashioned cat-and-mouse thriller and despite it, narratively, treading a fairly well-worn path it is quite effective at what it does...Plus points with the film lie with the protagonist who is smart and confident giving us a strong persona to root for (the fact that she doesn't trust 'the man' right from the start was also refreshing to see from a narrative standpoint). Her bravery and resourcefulness make her a worthy opponent for the antagonist and one senses that he actually has some respect for her as the film progresses. There is also some tense moments (more so in the middle of the picture when the man is hunting Jessica). Of course, some suspension of disbelief is required to accept what you see here when Jessica is out in the open and is being pursued (one scene involving a tree trunk blocking a road is one such example), but for the most part it works and compared to similar films within the genre Alone does seem to be fairly grounded.For the most part this film belongs to 2 actors; Jules Willcox and Marc Menchaca and both do commendable jobs. The latter was already halfway there with the way he looked in the film, but he backed this up with a creepy performance as well.Alone doesn't really have many surprises nor does it offer much that hasn't been seen before, but it does at least have a protagonist who isn't quite as cliched as many that have gone before her and there are plenty of tense moments in this minimalist thriller that mostly succeeds.",Alone
7,jewelch,Amazing all the way to the end,9,3 January 2021,"[Menchaca's] malicious control, the way he shifts from a damaged bird of a man to a hulking beast, helps put Alone away from the pack of middling modern slashers.

8,joiningjt,"Entertaining!! great lead actor and villain, will watch the sequel!!!",8,29 December 2020,"Read a lot of negative reviews where they say its predictable and already been done. At this point and time what hasn't already been done?? Another alien movie? How about another zombie movie? Or a super heroe movie? Or a movie with a billion dollars worth of special effects but no story!! This movie did what a movie is suppose to do it entertained me!! The actors we believable the story works and the ending kept it open for a sequel which I will watch. Yes it's been done before and wasn't really anything new but it kept me watching kept me interested in how it turns out and i disliked the villian and cared about the victim. End of subject, dont overthink it just watch and enjoy a well made thriller, also excellent cinematography!!",Alone

11,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Blend of Road and Lost in the Woods Horror,8,6 October 2020,"This was a movie that I was looking for a Featured Review over on Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast and saw this was playing at the Gateway Film Center. I checked up a bit to confirm it was horror and from what I read, it fit the bill for me. Jaime and I decided to give this a viewing that night as well. The synopsis here is a recently widowed traveler is kidnapped by a cold blooded killer, only to escape into the wilderness where she is forced to battle against the elements as her pursuer closes in on her.To just build on what the synopsis is stating, we're following Jessica (Jules Willcox). She is packing up her life into a mini-trailer that she can tow with her car. There is the feeling that she is running from something and isn't until later we learn what that actually is. I did notice early on that she is wearing two rings around her neck, her engagement and wedding ring. Before moving on, it should be established this is taking place in Oregon.While on the road, she gets behind an SUV that is going slow. She tries to pass, but when she does it speeds up. There is a near-miss with a semi-truck. The driver then decides to tailgate Jessica, honking and flashing lights. This causes her to go more into a panic and she pulls off the side of the road, allowing them to pass.She calms down and later gets gas. Jessica finally calls her dad, which he is voiced by Shelly Lipkin. She reveals what she is doing and he is shocked. Things get a bit weird though while she is talking to him and she sees the SUV from the highway go by. Speaking that is a bit off the highway in a small town, this spooks her where she struggles to go to sleep that night.The next morning as she goes to hit the road, a man knocks on her window. He is Marc Menchaca and he is the driver of the SUV. He apologizes for what happened and although Jessica accepts it, she is weirded out by what is happening here. She takes off and continues her journey. Later, she comes to the same SUV blocking most of the road and the guy is in a sling. He asks her to help him push it off to the side of the road and give him a ride to the next gas station. She offers to help in other ways, but he is insistent. She finally drives off, leaving him.During all of this, Jessica keeps avoiding answering calls from her mother. She finally calls her back when she stops off at a rest area. This is cut short when the SUV pulls up. Jessica panics as the guy walks toward her vehicle. It gets tenser when a van stops, blocking her progress and she panics. He catches up and knocks on her window, stating that she almost hit him when he was going to the bathroom.It all culminates when she loses control. There's a flat on the U-Haul trailer and the SUV isn't far behind. The man gets out and attacks her, where she wakes up in the basement of a cabin. We get to learn more about this guy as Jessica does what we can to escape and survive.There's where I want to leave this recap of the movie. This is definitely an interesting film, but I will say, we are getting some tropes that we've seen quite a bit of. That's something that I'm not going to say ruins the movie though. To really get into this, Jessica is dealing with the death of her husband. It appears that she wants to start over so she just packs up and leaves for a fresh start. This is really the worst decision that she makes as it puts her on the path of the man who is after her.Now I state it that way, because what makes this scary for me is the fact that she does a lot of things right and it still goes wrong. The writer of Mattias Olsson and director John Hyams know the history of abductors like this. I noticed when we first met the man that he only had one arm. He does actually have, but one is in sling, much like what Ted Bundy would do. It is disarming toward people to see them hurt like they are and shows vulnerability. Despite this though, Jessica knows something is off. She doesn't help him or get out of her car when he stops on her on the highway. She flees immediately when he comes into the rest area. She even calls 911 when a van comes up on her very fast. I just love even though it scares me with the idea that she is making the right decisions, but no matter what she still gets put into a bad situation.For this movie, we really get two different types of movies meshed together. The first part is a road horror akin to a Duel or Joy Ride. I'd put it closer to the former in how it all starts with the man following her, but we get personality of our villain like in latter. It then changes into a lost in the woods to survive movie. This is why I say it is tropes we've seen before, but I do like the conventions that they're playing with.Much like you'd get in a slasher film, I like that we have a broken character of Jessica who needs to find her strength. This is something closer to a rape/revenge film, taking out the rape aspect. I do like seeing that. Jaime told me this is something that really scared her and made her uncomfortable, as this is a big fear for her. I do want to give credit to Willcox for her performance. To bring this full circle, she is broken when we meet her and through this survival, she has to find her strength. We know its there as she is moving to take back control of her life.I really do need to go over Menchaca and Anthony Heald, the other two actors we really get to see. Menchaca I don't think I've seen before. I like the idea that we're getting real aspects pulled from kidnappers and killers to make this character. It makes him feel clinched, but his performance in the role I think helps. His look is just creepy. Heald is an actor that I normally despise the character he plays, but his performance fits well. Here he is Robert, a hunter that Jessica encounters. I like how things play out and I will admit he frustrates me. I can't fault him though as the logic is there. Aside from these two, the rest are mostly just hearing their voice and they do well for what was needed.The last thing for me to go over would be effects of the movie. This is one where we don't get a lot, but what we do is really good. The bit of blood and the bruising on characters looks realistic. There's also a scene where a stick gets lodged in a foot. This made me cringe and squirm. If you can do that, you got me for sure. The cinematography though is amazing. They do some really long shots and takes where they play with focus to where you can see only the foreground or background. This is effective in building tension for sure in my opinion. This is probably my favorite aspect is how well it is used.Now with that said, this movie was one that just popped up on my radar and I'm glad that I got the chance to see it. The concepts aren't new, but I like that they combine a couple of types of films I enjoy and have two great performances to drive it. The movie is intense and really does a great job at building tension as well. Something I didn't really go over would be the soundtrack and how that helps to drive it as well. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, but it doesn't need them either. What we get are practical and work really well. The cinematography is also amazing in my opinion. For this, I'd rate it as an above average movie, just bordering on good and one that I would definitely revisit to see how it holds up.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10",Alone
12,RatedVforVinny,"Marc Menchaca, a name to watch.",8,23 April 2021,"The actor Marc Menchaca is cast perfectly as a deranged killer and is worthy of all the plaudits. Although this movie has been done countless times , it's still wrought with tension and the first part plays like a modern version of 'Duel'. If it proves one thing, it shows you can make seemingly fresh, vital movies from such well worn material and although already typecast, Menchaca plays just about the sleeziest creep, you would pray never to meet for real.",Alone
13,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Alone,8,3 October 2020,"""I think I'm being followed"". Uh oh. I'm pretty sure I know what those words mean.Anyway, Jessica (played by Jules Willcox) is a widow who loads her stuff in a U-Haul and heads to an unknown destination. Along the way, she gradually gets tormented and kidnapped by a nameless psycho (played by Texan Marc Menchaca). That's the blueprinted rub of 2020's Alone. With ample enthusiasm and the need to write at 5 in the morning, it's my latest review.So yeah, we've seen films like Alone before and its title, well it's not too thought out. Still, Alone is one of this year's best. Feeling like Spielberg's Duel in which the antagonist actually talks, Alone's setting of lush, wet Oregon takes over as it becomes a swallowing co-star.The performances in Alone are as it seems, nerve-ending and calculated. Jules Willcox and Marc Menchaca share different sides of an acting coin. They exhibit decent vs. evil and damaged vs. non-empathetic. Menchaca reminded me of a mustached Jason Sudeikis while Willcox gave off a heroine, Winona Ryder type vibe. They are pretty much in every frame and carry Alone with superior aplomb.Directed by John Hyams (son of veteran helmer Peter Hyams) and nifty and compact in its 98-minute running time, Alone keeps you on your toes with devised, inching tension. It's a thriller mind you and it's done with careful skill despite feeling a little familiar (pale, cold-blooded killer stalks vulnerable female). Hyams using rack focusing, low angles, and teeming overhead shots, actually outdoes his pops here. Confidently committing to every shot, he is aided by rich, forestry cinematography from the seasoned Federico Verardi.Alone ends like other violent, heady rides but it doesn't cheat the audience. Every nuanced plot point, every grubby mano-a-mano, and every sense of foreboding shake up is assured. I hope I'm not ""alone"" in this inference.",Alone

15,rivertam26,Simplistic and intense,7,18 December 2020,"Originally a festival fave in 2018, this film became a sizable success during the pandemic benefitting from great reviews ( 94% RT) and a solid audience score. The film is an intense, sometimes frustrating, simplistic theater that focuses on a young woman moving cross country who comes up against as serial killer. It's a survival thriller that takes a bit to find it's stride but when it does is quite impressive. Filmed beautifully with a solid lead performance this stylish horror flick is slick, escapist entertainment. I expect great things from the director and actress moving forward.***.5/5",Alone

18,gedikreverdi,It was a very tense movie with chapters like a novel,7,14 December 2020,"Jessica whose husband took his own life moves to another place 4-day drive away from home. He hit the road with his stuff towed to his car. A man with an old jeep messes up with him on the road and after the night she spent at a motel he apologizes her for being a reckless driver. Then he saw him on the road his car broken down but as him being a creep she didn't help and kept driving. Then at a cigarette smoke break out of his car he saw him again and drove away but as he cut his tire she got out of the road she got rid of the trailer but he broke the window and caught her. She woke up locked up in a basement. He came and mocks her husband committed suicide and then after one night she uses her hoodie under the door and with a nail she dropped the key and took it inside the room and got out of the basement to see the man coming right into the house. That part was extremely tense. She waited in a dark room by the door as he sat down to eat lunch and talked to his family over the phone. She managed to run out of the house and the river part came up. That was a splendid part. She jumped in the river to run away. In the forest she walked over some root and had to take it out it was really gory. She then hit a an old hunter with a stick thinking it was the Kidnapper. The man helped him and they drove away but the road was blocked with a fallen tree. The kidnapper came with
His car saying his ""sister"" had problems. After some hesitation the hunter wanted his phone and the kidnapper beat him to death. And then at the night part he found her inside a cavity and shot her in the arm but she got away and hid. He let her use the rifle but she didn't buy the trick. After that in the daylight they come across while he was dumping and burying the old man. She sneaked into his car but the keys weren't there. She hid in the trunk taking the phone. The fight in the car was awesome. She attacked with a metal bar and they had an accident. She left the car and arrived an area without the trees and a fire that's being put down by a helicopter. She called his wife and told everything which I found a bit too far-fetched as everyone would call 911 once again. Then they fought once again and covered in mud and blood she managed to stab him to death and smiled at him while he was dying. It was one of the most tense movies I've seen lately.",Alone

20,markthomassintek,this does stand out from the other films of this genre,7,24 September 2020,"REVIEW - ALONENot another!YepWe have seen so many of these films recently where a female gets either kidnapped or chased by a nutter what could possibly make this stand out from all of the rest to make this your choice to watch?Well actually it was rather good with the suspense building nicely throughput the film, yes predictable in places and slow in others but what made this for me was 2 very simple things.1st, It's set in the real wild so rather than having an actor pretend to be in a forest in the middle of the sun shine this was actually filmed during one of the biggest rain storms so added that realistic element.2nd, as we see in so many films the complete back story of every character is told just rushing what could have been a great film, answering every question by the end of the film but this film doesn't, you don't know why he is doing what he is doing, you don't know his back story and you are only briefly told the main female characters back story which is relevant to what is happening in the film so this film could concentrate on the story without rushing or explaining everything, keeping you guessing as to his motive or not.So yes this does stand out from the other films of this genre and is one to see if you get the opportunity.Rating 7 out of 10",Alone

He looks like a basic b-flat guy, the better to eat you with my dear. She outwits the villain and then he outwits her, back and forth, in a well-paced hunt.

I spent most of the movie just waiting for the next completely unrealistic event to happen, and one after the other, they kept on coming.I wasn't afraid or 'thrilled' for a single minute... the movie should be classified as a 'sci-fi movie' instead of a 'thriller' due to how unbelievable the set of circumstances are that befall the main character. 4/10, would absolutely not recommend.",Alone

The hunter doesn't fully grasp the concept of a rifle, and that it doesn't work well at close range? The main protagonist is trying survive though out, yet has no kind of survival instinct? Always choosing to be as close as possible to the killer with no real attempt to defend yourself or escape? knife in hand with your attempted killer giving you his back while driving, and an opportunity to stab to kill you take a jab at the wrist?

28,johannes2000-1,"Okay, but not above average.",6,3 October 2020,"The premise is not very original: someone who's on a road trip for whatever reason, is followed, abducted and held prisoner by a maniac for whatever vile purpose and has to find a way to escape. We've seen it dozens of times. So it's important to make such a premise into an exciting, fresh and compelling movie and here this movie fails in my opinion. Sure, the mortal fear of main character Jessica is palpable, the villain is creepy and menacing and there's a lot of running and panting so the pace is reasonably high, especially in the second half.But the point is, that apart from the premise, nothing much else happens, no sudden scares, spectacular twists or gruesome happenings, it's all about someone caught, on the loose again, chased and then: one of the two wins, the end. Even in the details everything is, for a meant-to-be horrifying thriller, rather lackluster. The villain for instance doesn't do anything nasty to Jessica when he has locked her in (his motives stay totally in the dark anyhow!) and Jessica succeeds in escaping in an almost ludicrously easy way.Marc Menchaca as the villain hasn't much to act besides looking creepy and threatening, but the acting by Jules Willcox is fine and very convincing.

33,Just-A-Girl-14,I love survival movies but this one is just not good,6,13 August 2021,"Yes, it's been done before but frankly I don't care. I can watch this story a million times just as long as it's good. This one is not good and here is why. First, the beginning of the movie is kinda boring. There's a woman, she's driving somewhere with her belongings. We get there's a backstory but we don't know what it is. Second, she meets this weird guy over and over again. It doesn't seem he is following her so how do they meet again and again? We don't know. Who is he? What's his problem? Where is he from? No clue. We get it, he's the bad guy. She gets a weird vibe from him too but does she write the license plate number? No. Does she tell anyone about him? No. Does she stay on less remote roads? No. Does she call 911? Eventually yes, but only when she's panicking (with no reason) and doesn't know where she's at (and obviously there's a bad signal). Then she is kidnapped by the guy. This is the point in which we need to really care about her, but why would we? We know nothing about her and she doesn't seem to be very smart considering she's clearly stalked by the weirdo. Then she escapes. I loved what she did with the key and I loved that she jumped in the river. This is the part we need to see some survival skills or at least good instincts but somehow the only one with good instincts is the guy cause he keeps finding her over and over and over again. Is it a forest or a garden? If she was on foot and he was a good tracker maybe, but once she jumped in the river, it should have been it. The Robert character was an interesting addition cause so far there are no other characters and honestly these two can't carry the movie all by themselves. Unfortunately, despite having a gun, he gets himself killed almost immediately. Why was the road even blocked? Are we supposed to believe this guy had time to plan this and cut down a tree? Please! No way. Bad luck maybe? Who knows. Then she does the dumbest thing ever. She gets into the guy's car. Seriously? Who would do that? Then she overpowers him and gets the knife but does she stick it in his neck? No. She gets him in the arm. The car flips over, both survive because... well, why not. Then she gets the phone and calls this guys wife! Not the police, not her parents. Nooo! She calls some woman she knows nothing about. See a motif here? Let me give you a hint: dumb, dumb, dumb! It's hard to care for someone that stupid but whatever. The movie is over anyways after the most ridiculous fight ever considering she got shot, he got stabbed and both were in a car accident. The fight and a lot of the movie was well shot but the script sucks! Watchable? Yes. Good? NO!",Alone
34,Mehki_Girl,"Annoying, But Overall Satisfactory",6,17 January 2021,"While in the end this was enjoyable and killed a Sunday afternoon during covid, I found myself very annoyed at a lot of stupid mistakes the heroine made: spoilersShe tries to pass a car on a mountain road and obviously angers the driver.The driver pulls up that night while she's talking to her mom on the phone at a gas station then speeds Safeway, uh-oh. She makes no mention of this incident, what happened earlier, and that now this person seems to be following her.The same driver confronts her outside of a motel. She engages with him and even rolls her window down partially. Gives him her name.If she didn't mention him to anybody before this would certainly be the time. Napa a picture of that car!!!She takes no picture of the car, she takes no picture of his license plate and she doesn't try to take a picture of him.He blocks your path on a mountain road and she stops instead of just driving right around them and continuing.At this point now it is time to start texting someone and informing them and taking pictures and sending it to them, just in case. Not to mention GPS to the greatest sheriff or had station and report this nut.He later follows her and now she calls the cops on the dark of night on a mountain road she doesn't know where she is and then he passes her. Does she take a u-turn knowing that he already has blocked the road ahead of her in the past?No she doesn't.Then her tire blows and she goes off the road and does she turn off her light in the dark so just in case he comes back he can't really quite see her? Nope.And of course he comes back attacks and kidnaps her.She escapes and just as she's about to leave he's comes back to his cabin and she hides in another room or behind a door. He goes downstairs and instead of tiptoeing out of the house she stomps across the floor slams the door and runs into the woods.She hurts your foot and proceeds to scream as she removes the stick instead of stifling herself. He's headed off in the wronh direction but now she's given him her location.She spends a lot of time looking around trying to decide which way to go, making a lot of noise because she hurt her foot instead of just running headlong, as fast, as far as she can.Wow, the steps choices. This ends up being overall satisfactory viewing again with an ending that I enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon during covid. But you may find this very annoying for all the stupid mistakes that she makes as a woman alone on the road.This is a remake of a Swedish original, called Försuvven (Gone) and maybe that version is a lot better. I'm looking for that movie.",Alone
35,stevenrotherforth,Somewhat of a surprise despite the unimaginative title,7,6 September 2021,"AloneMovie 7.5/10Whilst the title may lack in creativity 'Alone' is a solid kidnap movie elevated by the two lead performances and some thoughtful direction by John Hyams.Hyams is a master at B movie fodder but this latest offering is somewhat of a step up in quality. Hyams has crafted a tense taught thriller that takes its own sweet time to tell the story.There's the odd common trope of the genre scattered throughout but for the most part this movie delivers what it intends to do.Our main character is the victim, Jessica played believably by Jules Willcox. Her performance is never over sold. Instead Willcox plays her character as vulnerable and frightened but with tremendous resolve.Marc Menchaca is the villain. A creepy unnerving individual. Menchaca's turn here reminiscent of Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill in 'Silence Of The Lambs'. I'll say no more as this is high praise indeed.'Alone' once getting into its stride is a good addition to the genre. It doesn't break any new ground but remains believable even in the final act where most movies of this type tend to fall down. It's a movie worthy of your time and available on Sky Cinema at time of writing this review.Picture quality 8/10Here's a turn up for the books! An actual Sky Cinema 1080p presentation that isn't marred by compression issues. There's no sign of banding and dark scenes manage to come across effectively.'Alone' looks sublime even in HD. Detail is razor sharp considering the platform usually falters unless viewing in UHD. Motion is handled well with Bird's eye views of the forest below looking very clean. Colours of surrounding vegetation is impressively rendered making for a pleasant viewing experience.Sound quality 7/10The vanilla 5.1 mix on offer here gets the job done but it's not one to showcase your new home theatre system. Most of the sound stage is steered front and centre with the rear channels left to convey atmospheric sound.I up-mixed the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix using DTS Neural X. This helped push some effects up above. The sounds of chirping birds and creaking trees could then be heard overhead. This elevated the sound mix (pardon the pun) to dramatic effect.LFE on the other hand is a mixed bag.The bass drop which accompanies each chapter of the movie as it is displayed onscreen has real impact, as does the dramatical music score. It is dynamic effects that lack a little. Gunshots are deprived of weight but this is nitpicking. Overall the mix is adequate and mirrors the tight budget constraints of the movie.Final Thoughts'Alone is a good looking movie with some fantastic performances from the two lead performers. The film burns slowly at first before igniting into something of a real surprise.",Alone

The funniest bit was when she happened across a dumb hunter who she attacked by mistake. Once she has explained what has happened all he says is come to my car to get some spare boots !! Really? Then she stands around admiring the trees before she gets into his car.I won't even talk about the part where the abductor catches up with them because that has to be one of the worse scenes for acting I have ever seen.Don't bother with this.

37,Mike_Devine,"A simple, naturally beautiful thriller",6,15 March 2021,"Low-budget survival thrillers can vary widely due to a number of elements. In 2020's indie film 'Alone,' an incredibly unrealistic plot is countered by exceptional cinematography and a heavy dose of cat-and-mouse.Here, we follow a young woman named Jessic (played by newcomer Jules Willcox) as she travels into the northern wilderness to start a new life. Of course, things don't go according to plan once a creepy mustachioed man (Marc Menchaca) and his banged up Jeep Cherokee enter the picture. The reliance on these two actors to carry the film is a lot to ask, but the simplicity actually works out well in this instance, as we have plenty of time to get to know them - for better or worse. This ratchets up the sense of peril that Jessica is in, which adds to the overall feeling of uneasiness.But it's not all about these two distressed (and distressful) characters. Nature is ever present throughout 'Alone' - whether it's the river, the rain or everything else. These elements enhance the film because there's so much that can be done to make for interesting camerawork. Also, seeing the sheer terror juxtaposed against the natural beauty of the flora is something hard to describe.Sure, 'Alone' is by no means a masterpiece, but when judged within its own genre, it's one of the better efforts in recent years.",Alone

41,leesimon-26357,Above average escape thriller,7,6 February 2021,"Not sure why so many of the negative reviews criticize the ""radical feminist agenda"" in this movie. I did not pick up on any gender statements, stereotypes, or even themes. There are literally 3 on screen characters; 2 males and 1 female. At times, the woman does or believes stupid things, and at times there is a male character that does or believes stupid things. Then the kidnapper is a man. Big deal. If you need your movie villains or heroes to be the Human Being from Community (no gender, race, age, religion, etc...) so as to avoid a stress-related aneurysm for you, then maybe movies aren't for you.
Good movies are stories with characters, and characters have characteristics. There may be movies out there that have a strong opinion about ""all men do this,"" or ""all females are this,"" but this is not that movie. This is a very straight forward, slightly above average, well shot and well acted escape thriller. You're not really going to see anyone re-imagine the genre with this movie. It goes basically how you think it will, but it is suspenseful throughout.
There are a couple surprises here and there, but nothing really to write home about. Watch it if you want a couple thrills, and you won't be disappointed. One thing I enjoyed greatly was that it did not have poorly written, stupid or unrealistic dialogue. I'm sure the movie benefits from the fact that 85%+ of it is without dialogue, just panting, breathing, or people holding there breath. The rest is written very smoothly. Granted the characters don't always say smart things, but it is realistic and believable that these people would be speaking like they do; it doesn't feel forced or choppy.

Well, the movie really gives you a hard time with the suspension of disbelief, because of the many incomprehensible actions of the woman and the incredible number of coincidences that happen to make that the bad guy can always find her no matter what. If you manage to forgive that, the film is quite enjoyable.",Alone

49,richardwworkman,Edge of your seat ride,7,19 March 2021,"There were a few films like this during 2020 where a woman was forced to fight for her life against a deranged psycho killer. The Hunted, Lucky, Becky and The Invisible Man all brought the pursuit horror/thriller and psychological horror sub-genre together.Alone is definitely at the top end of the scale and in terms of production this is closer to The Invisible Man than the others.The plot revolves around the dark double life of the man. A nameless figure that gradually grows to represent an archetype psycho killer he is cold blooded and distinctly systematic in his pursuit of his prey.Similar to other films in its genre, Jessica begins as the helpless victim, weak and unsure of herself but develop her character as her survival instinct kicks in.What follows is something of a #metoo allegorical tale of a man so confident in his dominance that he feels entitled to dominate and take Jessica's life from her.

58,RMurray847,"A taut, tense little thriller",6,8 January 2021,"The plot of ALONE sounds unoriginal and like a prime opportunity to cover familiar ground for the umpteenth time. The recently widowed Jessica is moving her belongings and her life away from the city where her life hit this tragedy, and moving ""up north"" into the heart of Oregon. Just her car and her tiny uhaul. On the way, she encounters an aggressive driver who at first won't let her pass and then zooms past her and in general scares her. From that point, their encounters escalate, and eventually she is taken prisoner by this unnamed Man, and hidden away in his cabin deep in the woods. So far, so ho-hum.It's all in the execution, and here is where this little film excels. Jessica (as played by Jules Willcox) is resourceful, and she smells danger immediately. Frankly, she probably would have been okay without having to lug an unwieldy uhaul around with her. In the early going of the film, she does a good job of NOT being that heroine that we want to yell at for being stupid. This makes it easier for us to sympathize with her; she's resourceful but at a disadvantage. Her disadvantage mostly being that she's not a single-minded lunatic. Marc Menchaca (so good and creepy in the mini-series ""The Outsider"") is Man. He does a great job of seeming perfectly normal and perfectly dangerous at the same time. The film is smart enough not to play with our expectations. We see this guy is ""wrong"" immediately and he is, indeed, very wrong.I won't say more about the plot, because the cat-and-mouse game that develops has some nice surprises and even the expected cliches are somewhat refreshed by committed performances and terse direction from John Hyams. Mother nature is also beautifully filmed, making the movie splendid to look at.It's not all perfect. Jessica's behaviors become a little more irrational as the film moves on, and occasionally you DO want to yell at her for the stupid stuff she does. The finale, while cathartic in some ways, also leaves you scratching your head. Would that really have happened? (Sorry to be coy...trying not to spoil.) A few plot points are a bit hard to buy, especially how the two keep running into each other. Aren't the woods enormous? Why do they always seem to be right near each other? (Well, because if they weren't, there wouldn't be a plot.) So yes, there are holes...but it's still a lot of fun, and if you want an edge of your seat, bare-bones thriller, you could sure do a lot worse than ALONE.",Alone
59,trnjamesbond,Alone Is A Blend of Two Great Films,6,28 June 2021,"Alone is of cat and mouse style, the lead female role is played by Jules Willcox, and the male lead role is played by Marc Menchaca. Written by Mattias Olsson and directed by John Hyams, who's credits are mostly from television.This film starts out with an intriguing character Jessica, we don't really know who or what she is about, but the opening scene makes the audience feel that somehting is troubling in her life.We then cut to a road trip scene, where Jessica sets out in what seems to be starting a new life. What she is running from we are not shown at this point in time. During this trip she encounters a vehicle that seems to be playing speed games with her. She eventually passes the vehicle only to meet up with the person later on while she is stopped. It definitely triggers the flight or fight scenario from the viewers prospective, as well as the characters prospective.A lot of people that have seen and reviewed this film seem to ask daunting questions, and knocking the films core. I don't want to give anything away or spoil the film, but to respond to a lot of viewers questions, this is a road cat and mouse film, it doesn't pretend to be something else. The director did a great job as far as cinematography goes, the writer kept you in suspense even though this sort of story has been tackled before. The final scene is definitely shows the strength and originality of the film.This film also gives nods to the films ""Breakdown"" and ""The Vanishing"" from the 1990's, the film meshes those two scenarios well. The performance from Jules Willcox and Marc Menchaca are very well rounded, once again, they don't pretend to be something that they are not.I really like this type of genre, and it was in my opinion well done. It's nice to just sit back and enjoy a film, that is entertaining, keeps you on your toes, even though like I said it's not really anything new, but it's definitely worth a watch.",Alone

This little film made a big impact on me as it was totally a thrill ride through and through. It's advantage? Simplicity. This film doesn't go over the edge, but rather stays centered on what it is. Good old and classic filmmaking proves you don't need capes, and superpowers to make a great film. No big named actors or director, but people who care about the material they are given. Jules Willcox just acts scared the entire film, but it's her bravery when she needs it is when her character and performance shines through. The standout however was Marc Menchaca. He really does a great job at making you believe at first that this guy is harmless and fools you until it's too late. Menchaca goes from harmless to feared on a flick of a switch. Once he does that, he holds your suspense tight and doesn't let go as you have no idea what he's going to do next and how.

The first 15-20 minutes has a very Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"" (1971) feel to it, does anyone else agree? I think it's the whole car in front not letting her past and then when he does, there's oncoming traffic causing her to lose her steering and go off the road.
Then there's just small elements from the movie Vacancy thrown into the mix.The rest of the movie gets more intense and although the ideas have been done before, I like the whole female heroine stuff.

The suspense isn't there, because you assume the outcome of certain characters, and you're always right.

90,nehpetstephen,Fine but forgettable,5,19 September 2020,"ALONE is a finely made film: the paranoid cinematography, languorous editing, and immersive sound design coalesce into an experience that is palpably nerve-racking at times, and the performances, albeit not especially outstanding, are perfectly believable. This film should satisfy you, more or less, as a riveting thriller, but it's doubtful that it'll stay with you long after the credits have rolled.The story is, well, very simple--a classic cat-and-mouse thriller pulled from Serial Killer Plotting 101. There's a freshness to how the main character behaves quite realistically within every situation. She never falls for what's obviously a trap like many cinematic idiots often do; there's a sense that she's always doing what we would probably have done in the same situation rather than simply what the screenwriter thinks would be interesting. While such believability is, unfortunately, rather rare in movies, there's also nothing very surprising about it. From beginning to end, everything is quite predictable.Unfortunately, whatever the film succeeds at in terms of behavioral realism, it fails at in terms of making the situations unfold naturally. The woods of the Pacific Northwest are quite massive, but the number of serendipitous run-ins in this story makes it seem like they're a couple of acres at most. The plot depends upon the characters always being within about fifty yards from each other, which is rather frustrating by the end.What was more frustrating for me, however, was how weak the characterization was. The film never succeeds at making the two characters anything other than superficial ciphers in a very cliched serial killer plot, however realistic their behaviors and the actors' performances might be. The screenplay hints at some possible thematic meanings that a very generous viewer could possibly mine--likening the abduction to grief; comparing the will to survive with suicidal depression; the hint that you never truly know what's going on in another person's mind, whether that's suicidal urges or serial killer urges--but in the end none of these interpretations really resonate.In the end, there's nothing to really recommend this film--nothing that really stands out--despite it being perfectly competent.",Alone

Cinematography was very good as well,except perhaps for a long-feeling period where it is too dark for too long. We get it, it is dark at night in the woods. That's nitpicking though. But back to the story. Full of your typical clichés. The baddie is nearly omniscient most of the movie. Early on, I thought he had a tracker on her car, but he must just have the nose of a super-bloodhound. The actions of Jessica made me think of that insurance commercial where instead of getting in the running car to escape, the pursued decide to hide in a garage full of chainsaws.

Yes, the plot has been used before. Yes, the genre is an old one. Nothing new under the sun in any film. Hitch made at least two of his movies twice, and used the same theme of innocent man pursued by both the police and the bad guys multiple times.Yet when you add good production values, good writing, good direction, and good acting, even an old plot device becomes new and thoroughly entertaining. And that all rings true in this more than adequate suspense movie. It's doubtful that one could even count the number of films about an innocent woman confronted with acute danger. Yet the suspense here is so strong it all becomes rather new and exciting.Here, the woman is alone, with only her own wits, determination to survive, and some Hollywood luck to aid her. The only thing I found slightly distracting were the drone or helicopter shots taken from the sky. Since none of the characters are up in the sky to see these views, such camera work tends to mar the suspension of disbelief.

102,incubus-0914,Love the ending sequence,7,31 January 2021,"In the beginning, I was a bit frustrated because the heroine doesn't really take any precautions although she has a feeling that this creepy guy has been following her. I get that she has some issues with her mother, but maybe not calling 911 yet, but talk to your family about what's happening in case when something actually happens. Certainly not hanging up with your phone when this stranger who's been stalking you is about to approach you AGAIN! Keep talking so that he has to think twice before he does anything (because he wouldn't wanna let the other person on the phone know something fishy going on especially if he is a serial killer, don't you think?).Someone wrote some parts of this film is not plausible and I partially agree with the reviewer. It's uncanny that the heroine and the killer miraculously encounter many times in this seemingly vast woods.
However, you'll forget these small claims once the heroine gets captured. The story starts moving with a good pace from then on.I knew this girl wouldn't give up. She is a survivor! She even reminded me of the scene from Predator (1987) at one point lol.
At the end where she decides to face this psycho killer once and for all, it gets really good. I even rewound the scene and watched it again. The way she stands while holding a crowbar, man! It even has an atmosphere of Samurai movies: you resolve to kill your opponent or you'll die. It was pretty cool. I didn't expect that coming.
It is so good that you'll overlook any minor flaws of the movie.There are tons of movies like this one for sure, but don't stop watching even if you feel like you've watched this kind of movie before. The ending is pretty redeeming.

Still, it was entertaining. I will say that I think she encountered him too many times for being out in the forest for that amount of time, and surely it would have taken him quite some time to saw down a tree to block the road out once the hunter gave her a ride.

In fact if this were a real life situation I'd commend her on her tenacity and general toughness. I'm talking about the her very first couple of moves.1. The place in which you are headed will not run away. It will be there even if you're an hour or a week late. So don't pass any slow moving vehicle on a solid yellow line.2. If Jerk you're attempting to pass gasses on his car the instant you are at his side, don't become Shirley Muldowney... Ease off throttle and fall back behind the aforementioned JERK.3.

Similarly, if you have serial killer at your mercy, pinned beneath a car in a wreck, do not crawl away and leave him alive.6. When running away from serial killer, do not keep finding him in the exact spot you are in a million miles of woods (okay, that's down to the director/writer not the poor lass).So, the poor woman in this movie would have coped a great deal better if she'd leant these simple lessons before getting herself into this awful pickle.

First off, going to the car in the first place is an endgame move. There is no sneaking away. Considering he had the rifle, I would have gone the other way. Secondly, if the keys are in the ignition when she opens the door, it will chime. Game over. Finally, assuming she could really get into the back without him seeing her (no way), did he really bury the guy and leave the shovel right there?

Very good performances from both of the main actors that carried this film to a watchable event. I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised that I was enjoying this tense thriller. One of the better survival movies lately On Demand...worth the $6.99 rent for me. A decent 6 but 8 stars for the two actors.",Alone
126,referenciajoia-46445,to be seen by directors who make garbage in 2020,5,5 October 2020,"A low budget film that should be seen by many of these little filmmakers who are out there doing garbage. When a film has few actors but they are of sufficient quality and there is a good camera work this can work. This is the case, not being extraordinary, it is watchable and decent, not having to endure actors who are not and badly executed scenes without taste. Beautiful landscapes with a simple story but well executed enough to leave the category of a class B horror movie. The rating I give is for the effort made, I repeat nothing spectacular but watchable.",Alone

128,prince_c3,It was very close to be rated 7 stars.,5,21 October 2020,"The movie was very close to be one of the best serial killer, cat-mouse thrillers.
The story was good, the acting was really good from both the main characters,the location of Oregon, the West Coast wooded area was good, the picturization was great.
The good things about the movie was not adhering to the cliche script, there are dozens of these kind of movies come and go almost every couple of weeks and almost 99% flop because of same treatment of damsel in distress cliche scenes when main character make one after the other stupid after stupid moves, scream, run naked through the wood and unnecessary gore, violence and sexually pervertness. This movie didn't even go that route which was the positive thing and probably the only positive thing which is the reason I gave 5 stars and I could end up giving 7 stars easily if it's not for the following negative points.
There was hardly any character development.
Whether its West Coast, East Coast Canadian wooded and forest areas, it's really, really difficult to locate anyone so quickly in thick woods.
But, in this movie, the serial killer was always within a few yards from the victim at any given instance, it was almost like he inserted the GPS chip and following her with GPS device, at one stage I thought when he knocked out the main character, he might have put a gps locator inside, or at least they should have showed that to make it more practical the way he was keep locating her, even after 7-8 hours.
At one instance, she passed out for the entire night and next morning he was just there?
It's almost frustrating and all the real things about movie been varnished with this unrealistic within yards chased.
The second most negative thing about the movie was the motive of a serial killer. Majority serial killers catch their prey for sexual gratification, or make them feel powerful. When the serial killer kidnapped her, he didn't abuse her sexually or physically, also the holding chamber didn't show any past victims were there or any other evidence.
Overall, the movie was one time watch, but it could be a really good movie if it's not for above items.",Alone

130,ShaMana999,"In a world of incredible coincidences, a movie exist like all others",3,29 January 2021,"This movie offers very little of, well, anything. I've watched it before, you've watched it before, at this point pretty much everyone has watched it before. Offers no surprise, no turns, no intrigue, no suspense, no motivation and most importantly no explanation.Literally remove any of the one random occurrences in the movie and there won't be a movie. The bad guy always knows exactly where to be and how to be cool and creepy. The good girl always acts inept until the very end where she suddenly transforms in to Rambo. It's so predictable that I'm writing a review for something that I would usually never bother. It's just something not worth watching.",Alone
131,tankfreak,Kudos for skipping the usual tropes,7,22 January 2021,"This was surprisingly good and definitely maintains tension throughout, both through the acting and situation as well as cinematography and editing.Without giving away any specifics or being blatantly spoilery, what I really enjoyed is that the protagonist, Jessica, does mostly everything that any woman with common sense and a general concept of stranger danger would do. Her responses and reactions are 100% natural and believable rather than just being a walking horror movie trope that misses or ignores every hint of danger just for the sake of plot convenience. Very rarely did I find myself frustrated or rolling my eyes at her actions. Sure, she still finds herself in danger, but that's how actual life is. You can be suspicious and guarded around someone that's making you uncomfortable, avoid the more obvious potential traps, but still end up in danger anyway. As for the serial killer antagonist (who is simply credited as The Man) he's also quite believable in a non-horror trope way. Just a generic middle aged white guy, almost desperately plain looking, that you probably wouldn't even notice if you walked past him. He's very much ""the serial killer next door"" type.Now, I will say if you're expecting a ton of action and violence, you're not going to get it out of this movie. I don't even think imdb has this one listed as horror anymore since it's actual release, although I do personally think it qualifies as survival horror. Mostly it's a cat and mouse suspense thriller that delivers believable characters in a realistic and frightening situation. Very well done for what I assume was a modest budget.",Alone
132,RoadSideAssistance,REALLY!?,2,6 October 2020,"Okay, so this film starts out pretty decent. We are introduced to our main character and she's packing up to leave town early. She's lost her fiance/boyfriend (not sure) and for some reason leaves a day early after her parents said they'd help her move, because she doesn't want to talk to her mom. This is NEVER explored but let's fast forward to the meat of it.She's driving across the country and eventually runs into a car that stays playing games on the road. Long story short the guy driving the car stalks her (how? He just knew where she'd go and what stops she'd make?), captures her, keeps her in his basement and plans on molesting her and killing her. She escapes, he notices, she runs off, and dives in a river.From this point this guy might as well have a honing beacon planted on her because he knows EXACTLY where she is at all times (despite her floating who knows how far down the river, she gets rescued by a hunter who is driving her and he sets up a trap on some dirt road a ways down the river)... like WTF? And he's a psycho with a family... not like some mountain man expert.Basically this was the Terminator without ANY logical sense of how the Terminator knows where to go.The acting by the lead actress was pretty good and production quality was decent (hence the 2) but this movie was absolute drivel. Don't waste your time.This movie kind of set it up like a Rust Creek type movie (girl trying to survive) but the survival was barely even there, and it was COMPLETELY illogical how the 'Terminator' found the main character. Rust Creek did a film like this SO much better and showed how the guys could track the protagonist which made the film logical. This antagonist in this film just 'showed up' and 'did stuff'.Don't waste your time, 2/10, again check out Rust Creek. FAR better film (still kind of a C thriller, but how this has 6+ on IMDB is beyond me).",Alone

The point here is how to make an honest movie with low budget and a 3 person cast in such a classic topic as serial killer-victim chase-escape. A movie not interested in gory stuff (such an easy way to go ...) to enforce an otherwise predictable plot. The camera work was plain but efficient; the photography more than acceptable; the acting professional; the plot somehow surprising in the final scene (don't remember something similar).I am sure I'll forget about the movie in a week, but I don't regret watching it and this is something sooo difficult these days.",Alone

It's also astounding how he managed to keep finding Jessica with ease in his car, almost as if she had a psycho homing device on her. At one point, he even manages to dump a body right where Jessica happens to have stopped to take a rest in the woods!Stupid decisions are, of course, a necessary evil in these types of movies, like Jessica failing to finish her attacker off after a car crash renders him temporarily unconscious.Was it worth the $6.99 I paid to watch it?

172,eaveschristopher,Fresh But Familiar Genre Filmmaking,8,23 September 2020,Alone Micro Review -Alone is masterful genre filmmaking harking back to the classic psychological thrillers of Spielberg's Duel (1971) and Kurt Russel's Breakdown (1997). With a 98 minute run time the film is self aware of what it is and fully succeeded in accomplishing that result. Alone is fantastic at rollercoasting the tension while presenting stunning cinematography and superb performances.While Alone features many creative takes on the genre there are two specific clishies that occur for the sake of progressing the story. These will be self-apparent but are very brief moments that understandably serve as story shortcuts given the budget. The film features a fight scene that is better chrographed than most studio films due to its proper editing and use of longer takes.Marc Menchaca as the disturbed antagonist is a standout. His body language oozes dred and tension. The choice of Menchaca to just be disturbed amplifies the tension in that you never know who you could actually bump into. Alone is a memorable film that walks the line of what genre needs to be but adds just enough new to feel fresh.,Alone

Anyone with half a brain would have escaped without an issue, but no, every decision she makes causes screams of disbelief as she continually makes wrong choice after wrong choice making you wonder if the character isn't actually trying to be caught again.I found the scenes with the kidnapper slow, dull, boring, long drawn out moments which just got you rolling your eyes.

197,Marianne4388,"Great start, bad ending",5,9 May 2021,"SPOILERSIt started out great in my opinion! Creepy, realistic and very tense. Until the victim manages to run away, and it all fell apart.First of all, she ran into what looked like a huge forest in the middle of nowhere. Yet somehow, the creeper manages to track her down so easily. It's very unrealistic and what I think they should have done instead is trick the viewer into thinking he was onto her. Having her hear noises etc, but then reveal that he was actually in another part of the forest the whole time. With some drone shots panning over the forest near the ending. And never have them meet again after she escapes. In stead she would eventually find the road after days out there, and get help from a passing car. I would also liked to have seen the creep searching for her and then hear sirens in the distance drawing closer, and him realising it was all over. That would keep the tension, but be more belivable in my opinion.The whole thing with her getting into his car and calling 911 from the back of it was just stupid. No one would ever do that. And who leaves their keys in the car anyways. If the forest was small enough for him find her all the time, it also would have been small enough for her to find a road to take her back. Or find the dead guy's car and try to start it.I also didn't think the call to his wife and the final ""battle"" at the ending, was any good. It just felt like an attempt to make the leading lady seem more badass then she really was.It was an ok movie, but I would have like to have seen some more realistic things happen.",Alone

For the most part, she acts in a believable way for a young woman, and as a young woman myself, I'm so glad I wasn't rolling my eyes or groaning at how frequently she was putting herself in danger- like a lot of other films might've. A couple little 'hmm maybe thats not such a great idea' here and there, like the cigarette stops in a gas station, but still believable choices. Even after reading some reviews about how she should've 'struggled more' in the house, I disagree, as a girl it is 100% believable that you would hope to win someone over via submission when the odds are stacked so very, very much against you.But then the final quarter. She makes a decision to get into a vehicle and it is just SO illogical that I was almost screaming at the TV. No part of it really makes sense, and is very very almost her undoing, and at that point I felt totally disconnected to the character.There's also the issue of how this guy keeps finding her in the woods? In a huge, open forest after they've been separated? Inconceivable. At first I was convinced he must've put a tracker or microchip on her, because it seems the only way, but no- he didn't.

I was terribly disappointed. This movie was not good. It just wasn't. It was very typical for its genre, like any of these types of movies (bad guy catches girl, girl escapes, bad guy hunts down girl, and then the typical ""girl power"" happens). It brings nothing new to the table, and the worst thing for me was that it was terribly predictable and all the clichés one could ask for are in this movie which means the whole runtime the characters make idiotic decisions.

An all knowing hyper intuitive kidnapper/murderer who seemingly knows where his victim is at all times despite nearly impossible odds and no explanation on how he does it. He lacks this mystical ability for a couple of moments to further the plot.Honestly, we had this magic superpower with Freddy, Jason, and Michael. They're at least supernatural beings. This? This is just lazy writing to create a false sense of security once the viewer thinks the protagonist has an opportunity of getting away. You can make the argument that this person is an expert tracker even though they never eluded to it in the movie. It's honestly just another cheap thriller.6/10 because the movie is still pretty good and the acting is phenomenal. Just cut this hyper intuition BS out. It's over played and lazy.",Alone

The characters gave heart and while the dialogue can be a little stunted the movie provides enough thrills and jump scares to be above the norm.Horror wise there is not a lot there and the movie takes a little time to get moving however patience will make it more than worthwhile. There is one piece of cannon fodder in the movie and it is a shame he is in the film as for ten minutes it does derive from the story.This is a good film with plenty of action.

218,romanandd,Very suspenseful but only lacked two main things .,7,13 January 2021,Nobody really knows who the killer is or why he did what he did . I'm sure he had reasons to do what he was doing . But what was his purpose ? To kill ? Assault ? Or keep hostage until death? Either way he was a poor antagonist . He did everything right before catching her . Such as following her and making himself seem innocent . Until the right time . But once he got her he didn't do much or didn't think through his plans if he had any . And even if he needed time to think leaving someone in your house tied up while you go to the store with a key in the keyhole is just amateur to see . Best part about that she took advantage of his Mishaps and slow moving ways to escape . Then went back to doing what he did best which was following her until the end of the movie . Which just makes him a very good stalker. Not a capture guy or killer guy. With that being said in the beginning she was shaken up with how good he was at following and she got smart when she got away after she was caught . Perfect plot to a perfect escape . But the killer or whoever he claimed himself to be showed weakness too early . Not enough to be like wow this guy is insane . And the last thing was she was being followed and knew it too late and was traveling and she stopped wayyy too much to do things she could have done later such as talk to mom and dad on the phone. We know she didn't have anyone else to talk to but if someone was following me or they shook me up cause they were being weird I'm not stopping until I know I'm safe . It seemed she stopped every 5 -10 miles . Which is still good enough for him to track her easily . The fact she stopped so quick and chilled on the phone smoking was just nerve racking to witness . But I like her character better when she escaped . She was smart and she never got caught again by him and even out smarted him. So way to close in for character intelligence and not just another woman to get killed or taken for hostage for God knows how long . She even fought him when she had nothing else or nowhere to go and succeeded . Very suspenseful and has you glued for sure . But the movie did leave me talking like why doesn't she just do this ? Or do that or omg just do this . It's a 7 because it's a suspense type movie and it did just that. And ended the way we all would hope . Even gave us a slow burn until she escaped and hid in a nearby wood shed while he was on the phone and continued to eat after coming from the store . Good movie and I like adventure movies where it takes you almost everywhere . She went from driving to nearby hotel to gas station to truck stop to on the side of the road to in the basement of a house to in a closet to in the woods to under calm water to suppress breathing and back it up to the water fall she fell into and also back to in a old mans car hoping for rescue . Each moment had suspense so 7/10 . Nothing more or less !,Alone

Lies, lies and more lies!!",1,28 January 2021,"Same garbage done over and over always giving the victim -always a female- the upper hand over a male twice her size throughout the movie. Why don't they change it for once already and tell it how it would really play out. Everything was in her favor except for maybe 5 minutes when he had her in the cabin other than that she was basically Macgyver or Super Wonder Woman throughout the entire ridiculous movie. She had the strength to remove a nail with her bare hands from a 2 x 4 to use to push the conveniently placed key out of the keyhole. Oh, I almost forgot she was able to slide and push her sweater through the bottom of the door without it bunching up where of course the key landed. After his meal she is able run away from him even though she steps into a plant root which basically runs up her leg and she sits there with all the time in the world to remove it easily. Once again, she manages to get away from by jumping in the roaring rapids escaping drowning. Once he catches up to her she gets nicked by a bullet and survives the bitter cold rainy night and days without sustenance but not before pulling another Navy Seals moment almost under water while he gave a speech. The chase resumes the next day after she had a good nights rest nestled underneath a tree like Alice In Wonderland. Oh by the way, I almost forgot she sticks out like a sore thumb in her jeans and purple sweater and this guy, who claims to have done this before can't see her at all. Anyway, continuing on with this stupid movie we see ""the man"", burying the poor man the woman got killed while she gets into the car, steals his phone and makes it to the back of the car and lies there quietly. The ""man"" gets into the car without putting the shovel in the back of his car because of course he'd see her so we can't have that instead we have him be so incompetent by leaving evidence at the burial site. Back to the car, even though he suspects something isn't right inside the car and still even after he's frantically searching for his phone he knows she's in the back even though the car didn't fog up or change in smell after her being in the woods all this time she was freely able to swing and hit him numerous times with a tire iron causing an accident that of course (you guessed it!!!) she survives because remember she's Super Wonder Woman. She manages to get out of the car and walks out into the all of a sudden open area where the helicopter can see her but wait were not done because the final showdown is here! She is able to make phone calls because of course ""the man"" who we all know is incompetent does not have a passcode on his phone she places a call to his wife because she happens to know her phone number and tells her that he is a kidnapper and a murderer and of course his wife is gonna believe a psychotic person calling out of the blue. This ""victim"" like in all the other same bull caca movies like this survives every punch, backhand and kick this ""man"" delivers and is still able to overpower him and finally ram the tire iron in his chest.
I don't understand the purpose of these kinds of movies. Is it to make women out there believe they can actually survive something like this? There is no way in hell that is even possible. 1 out of 1000 maybe but that one time she would be lucky as hell to get away from a psycho like this.

Mark Menchaca is tremendous in everything he does. While the story is fairly simple, the execution is what makes it smart. It's well thought out and beautifully shot.As a producer, the film was a dream in the sense that it only required a total of about 10 actors on camera, including extras, and it really seems they were able to put their budget ""on the screen"".

I really enjoyed the pacing and the cinematography and the chapters added suspense and indie style.I think what I liked most about this film was that the protagonist did everything you'd imagine yourself doing if God forbid, you were in that situation. She was smart and cunning and had both vulnerability and gumption at different points. I think this film hit me differently because it was the film I really needed to see right now after hearing of awful recent events. I live in London, so this acted as some kind of relief and outlet for my anger I think. I wanted the protagonist to not only escape, but wanted her to make him suffer for what he did and planned to do to her, and ultimately that's what I got.

265,Dahbeed,Realistic story of survival that holds to the end,7,28 September 2020,"I enjoy survival movies because I like to put myself in the situation - how would I react? What would I do? This movie is very believable, especially from a female perspective. The heroine, Jessica, is not a ""superhero"" nor is she a victim. She isn't ""blond, buff & twenty"" like most of victims portrayed these days. Instead, she is your sister, daughter, friend - just a regular youngish (30?) woman, moving from one place to another, pulling a U-haul behind her much used car. Same for the ""man."" Average looking, even a little common looking - exactly the kind of guy you see everyday at the store or gas station. Their ""meeting"", too, is an event that occurs a million times a day all over the world. As I watched this, I found myself thinking, ""I've done that..."" Don't get me wrong, this isn't a feminist film at all. The movie keeps your interest simply because it is so believably realistic - Jessica and the man act and react like one would expect - not like a character in a script.

The hunter doesn't fully grasp the concept of a rifle, and that it doesn't work well at close range? The main protagonist is trying survive though out, yet has no kind of survival instinct? Always choosing to be as close as possible to the killer with no real attempt to defend yourself or escape? knife in hand with your attempted killer giving you his back while driving, and an opportunity to stab to kill you take a jab at the wrist? And in the final scene, at last with a working cellphone on hand in the woods you decide it best to stand in the only open treeless area to call the killer's wife instead of the police in an attempt to convince the wife that a stranger who she's never met on the other side of the call is about get murdered by the man she loves?",Alone

I live in Portland, Oregon and the filmmakers did a great job with locations, capturing the beauty of the Pacific NW that can be as foreboding as it is stunning. Yes, there are a few things one can nitpick - mainly that the two primary characters did have an uncanny knack for continuing to run into each other in a vast wilderness area but I would argue that without these interactions there would be no plot.

The man shows up and makes a beeline towards you so you HANG UP THE PHONECALL YOU WERE ON?

I'd like to point out exactly how unrealistic it actually was. First of all if I am traveling alone down back roads to my destination and encountered the same male character more than once and he approached me each time I would respectfully tell him to go f* himself. And immediately find the nearest freeway or major highway to continue my travels . I wouldn't make several rest stops especially not alone in the dark and get out of my car just to find the same guy there AGAIN. I would not stop and roll down my window after the 3rd time seeing him because now he's broken down in the middle of the woods asking for a ride. As this dude on the other review said I also like to put myself in a situation like this woman and think what would I do if held captive and I know for a fact I wouldn't beg to be let go saying I'll never tell anyone. I wouldn't let them freely touch me , I would most def put up a huge fight and struggle way more than the female character portrayed in the film because at that point what do you honestly have to lose if his plans are to kill you anyways.
I understand not all woman are like myself or would have the same strategies but I also believe that now woman are more observant of their surroundings and much more head strong not so submissive to men just because some may be bigger or stronger.

This was in the top 20 for thrillers so I picked it without even reading the description.Spoilers ahead!!The pros? It's pretty, set and filmed in Oregon. The acting is good.Everything else about it is ridiculous. From the very beginning I thought, this girl is so dumb! Why would I want to root for her at all? There's very little character background given so no connection is made there, and she proves really quickly to be a complete idiot with no common sense so it's very hard to want her to win.As another reviewer mentioned, the protagonist does NONE of the logical things women are taught to do to stay safe. She keeps randomly encountering this very creepy guy and doesn't stay off back roads after that? She tries to pass him on a curvy mountain road while speeding and pulling a uhaul trailer?When he accosts her at her hotel after trying to run her off the road, she gives him her name instead of telling him where to stick it? And after he's obviously following her, she stops to smoke in a dark and remote parking lot, and gets out of her car to sit alone to call her mother?It's one insane decision after another. And no explanation or even a hint as to how the Man is able to find her again and again, but leaves her be to escape and leaves his gun on the ground midway through the film, only to pursue her again the next morning?

317,juliencassidy,2hrs of my life I will never get back,1,4 October 2021,"Your typical kidnapp thriller of some girl driving somewhere, gets stalked by some creepy guy, girl does every stupid move thinkable and gets taken. The ending was so anticlimactic. No scary, no thrills, so predictable. All these rave reviews must be from those who get scared with lame horror films such as paranormal activity. Should have listened to the reviews and watched something else.",Alone
318,karlalan,A Suspense Thriller,10,11 October 2021,"Admittedly I read reviews like some of those listed, offering a seed of doubt in my mind and ultimately postponing my view of what is truly, a thriller. I will criticize their lack of insight but, ""hey"" -- I listened to them, too.This was one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen -- including movies from genres that have included horror to suspense thrillers to the purely psychotic.What made this so incredibly frightening is the fact that I've met up with the likes of people who look more like they drive a Subaru than having presented themselves as cold-blooded killers. And I, too, would have rolled down my window to at their request.As with many, many victims in real life, the lead character (""Jessica"") in this movie is well-cultured, educated, and not illiterate in the social graces. She resultingly finds herself a prisoner of her own morals and ethics, choosing to pose a social respect to a vicious, deceptive killer masquerading as someone we've all met on roads, waysides, and sometimes in the dark.A well-characterized fear in this movie that's heavily identifiable with the viewer is Jessica's dismissal of that little voice inside that tells her things aren't right (and they aren't).The movie is a run-like-hell for the lead character through an onslaught of attacks exercised with precision and an un-nerving patience and focus. .This movie is a cut-throat thriller, especially for those of us who understand and have experienced situational entrapment. We are all victims of our own distracted, isolated, and remotely encumbered times of our lives and ""Alone"" wastes no time exploiting in-full, these moments of our lives in a heart racing thriller that I give a ""10"".",Alone
319,StineSnifflington,Uncomfortable!,5,2 October 2020,"I liked the movie because the story is good and I felt uncomfortable the ENTIRE time!What I didn't like was the character in it, she did all of those things you would never do if you were stalked down by a crazy psychopath, which was really frustrating to watch. Another thing I didn't like (SPOILER ALERT) was the fact that no matter where she went hiding he always managed to find her, even though the forest was giant.",Alone
320,kgmfer,Don't waste your time,1,27 October 2020,"It's really not worth watching. Storyline is weak, characters are weak and filming is not to today's standard.",Alone
321,lolerskating,Typical premise packs a punch!,7,9 February 2021,"Yes, the cat and mouse kidnap trope is nothing new here, but you essentially knew what was going to happen in this film when you watched the trailer, where it showed you almost an entire summary of the movie. Ya did it yourself, bud.That being said, the film had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish! Tense action all the way through and engaging movement throughout. I cannot believe some people are complaining about the pace! If this is considered slow paced to you, maybe watch Transformers instead, idk.Main character is quiet and terribly anxious, but like, her husband just died so why not cut her some slack? I thought the acting was good for unknown actors.Overall, this was a lot of fun to watch and just goes to show a solid thriller can be made on a small budget.",Alone
322,danielbergman1984,Lowbudget when it´s at it´s best!,7,29 October 2021,"The writer, the director, the actors - they all got me from the beginning. The guy is obviously a psychopath - you probably need to be a psychopath to miss that.You know what will happen, sort of, but they managed to do things a little bit different in this one.I enjoyed it very much!",Alone
323,SalvadorDaLee,"Love the Simplicity, Hate the Character.",6,28 September 2020,"The tone, atmosphere, setting, and set up all make for a simple, yet effective thriller about a women's survival against a killer and the elements. But my God she is dumb and dumb characters in these situations infuriate me. She has her moments but the dumb ones by far outweigh the smart. That's all I have to say.",Alone
324,tanya517,Don't Waste Your Time!,1,30 January 2021,HORRIBLE!!! Such B.S. this movie is incredibly ridiculous. In a MASS Forest he just so happens find EXACTLY where she is. Come On!!! Then FINDS HER AGAIN! PLEASE!!! I got dumber just watching it! How stupid does the writer think we are!? Don't Waste Your Time and Intelligence on this one. Unfulfilling Ending too!,Alone
325,morsot,The GPS ruined the movie,1,9 January 2021,"The GPS says it's going to take 4 days to reach the destination... she is in her vehicle during the day has the ordeal with the jeep he takes the exit she continues straight and then comes to a stop and all of a sudden it's night time... keep in mind they're in the mountains.... she sleeps in a motel wakes up which again I assume is in the morning and the guy with the jeep is there. She leaves abruptly. All of a sudden it's night and she's smoking a joe at a public rest stop I believe, and he shows up randomly.. she then tries to exit and a random van stops suddenly blocking her in and gets out for no apparent reason then the next frame it appears as the van is going down the highway. There is no way she was in the same damn state for 2 days of traveling. I'll finish the movie but if I was watching this alone I would have turned it off by now. Acting is good though.",Alone

327,angkennedy77,Don't waste your time,4,29 December 2020,I like suspenseful movies but this movie was more stupid then suspenseful. The main character made the dumbest decisions that a child wouldn't even make. Annoyed me more than anything. I was rooting for her to die most of the movie to end my misery.,Alone
328,zajac1661,Intense entertainment,8,19 May 2021,"A simple but solid movie. Solid thriller/horror. The movie potraits a woman being hunted by a human predator, where the Cat and Mouse game brings you to the edge of the seat.Considdering 9/10 of new horror/thriller movies are stinkers, this one deserves a thumbs up. The movie does not bring a groundbreaking story to the table, but has quite a feeling of realism. The acting is well executed and carries the movie alongside a pace that never runs out of steam. Great location settings, with a constant feeling of being vurnerable and away from human civilization.Out of the last 20 random movies i saw, this was one of the more enjoyable and surely worth a watch.Recommended from the couch.",Alone

331,jlundgren-73354,"I get the concept, poor execution.",2,5 June 2021,"The idea behind the film was solid, but the execution was poor. Saving grace was the acting between the main characters. Dont go into this film thinking your seeing an academy worth film.",Alone
332,thomasmoralez,Frustrating,3,16 November 2021,"Tired of watching movies with characters that make stupid decisions for the sake of plot development. The lead character could have avoided this entire situation if she would have just done what any normal human being would have done in the same situation. Only saving grace is the main antagonist. Actor playing this role does a great job. Otherwise, don't watch this movie unless you want to be frustrated and annoyed for over an hour watching people make horrible decisions.",Alone

The guy is not even freaky, just a complete turd. Did he put a tracking device up her butt while they were spooning in the basement? Because despite the fact there are miles and miles of forest in all directions, he finds her time after time after time. Then she finds him and gets in his car while he's not looking! Okay??! Who would do that? The soundtrack was terrible too. So bad. We laughed at all the stupidity, so it was slightly entertaining, which got it 3 stars.",Alone

335,michellecarolyn,Solidly Entertaining,7,23 September 2020,"This is a very well done movie that delivers on the premise presented in the synopsis. The characters could have been developed more. However, I believe that the actual development leaves the characters just ambiguous enough to allow the viewer the ability to ""imagine"" the motivations and background for each. ALONE will not be added to any of my favorite movie lists, but when I come across it again in a few years I will rewatch it. Ultimately, I truly enjoyed watching this film.",Alone

2- no explanation on the motivations of the kidnapper
3- too many coincidences: he manage all the time to find here as a classical cat/mouse chase
4- too many illogical event
5- an end without any explanation.",Alone
