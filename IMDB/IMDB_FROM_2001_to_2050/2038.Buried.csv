0,Leofwine_draca,"Great premise, not bad thriller",6,1 July 2013,"BURIED, a Spanish-made production with US backing and an American lead, is the latest in a long line of shot-in-a-single-location movies; other recent entries include PHONE BOOTH, 127 HOURS (trapped in a canyon) and DEVIL (shot in a lift). This one takes a more extreme approach to the premise than the others, as the entire film is set inside a coffin where a guy has been buried alive.For the most part, this is watchable drama and it's rarely boring, as you might expect given the premise. The writer has carefully worked everything out, so that there's incident at regular intervals (Reynolds has to contend with plenty of dangers, including sand and snakes) and dialogue thanks to the handy mobile phone he's been buried with.I'm no fan of Reynolds as an actor, but he acquits himself quite well with the material and gives a believable performance as a guy driven to desperation and the edge of his mind. The most impressive talent belongs to director Rodrigo Cortes, who manages to keep everything interesting despite the limitations of his story - it's a bravura job, and the ending nails it perfectly.",Buried
1,SnoopyStyle,Good work from Reynolds,6,14 September 2014,"It's 2006. Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is an American truck driver working in Iraq who wakes up to find himself tied up in a wooden box. He has a cigarette lighter, and he finds a cellphone. He was in a convoy that got hit by an ambush. He calls various people but has a difficult time getting help.There is solid acting from Ryan Reynolds and good camera work from director Rodrigo Cortés despite the limited space. However the limitations leave it feeling very repetitive. There is only so much that the camera can do for this scenario. It's relatively dark and it sometimes slip from tense to boring. That's the repetitive feeling as the director continuously try to ramp up the tension. That also goes for the dialog where nobody seems to be that helpful in an obvious ploy to amp up the tension with every frame. It's one long manipulation that either pulls you right in or leaves you tired of all the pulling. The movie's one and only tone also left me worn out.",Buried
2,Prismark10,Going underground,3,13 May 2016,"Buried is a bottle movie. There is only one actor on screen. Ryan Reynolds plays Paul Conroy is an American truck driver in Iraq who suddenly awakes in a wooden coffin.He has a lighter, a mobile phone and a pen knife. Realising he is buried alive Conroy manages to get a mobile phone signal and call for help.He starts to piece together what may have happened to him and remembers his convoy was ambushed by terrorists. Conroy has difficulties getting through to someone at first but eventually gets someone at the State department and a hostage rescue group led by Dan.At the same time his kidnapper phones him and demands a ransom. Conroy needs to give Dan enough information to rescue him but even in his coffin there are hazards such as a snake getting in and even a fire breaking out.The film has a novel premise but I have seen several of these types of films now and Buried is no great shakes. There is the ludicrous premise of Conroy being able to get a phone signal, the kidnappers thinking he is worth a ransom of $5 million, a snake just dropping by while he is underground and all that precious oxygen being used up while he uses the lighter.The director tries to add tension while Conroy talks to various people on the phone including his employer who fired him. I just thought the film got to be silly very quickly and rather dull as well.",Buried
3,claudio_carvalho,Claustrophobic and Tense,6,6 March 2011,"In 2006, the American truck driver Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), who was hired by the CRT contractor to work delivering supplies in Iraq, awakes buried alive inside a coffin in the Iraq desert. He recalls that his convoy had been attacked by rebels about two hours ago and finds a cell phone, a flashlight and his lighter inside the box. Paul unsuccessfully tries to contact authorities in CRT, FBI and state department office to disclose his situation, but he finds bureaucracy or absent people. Then he tries to reach his wife Linda, but she does not answer the phone. Out of the blue, one abductor contacts him asking a 5 million-dollar ransom and a video reading a note that is also inside the coffin. Paul realizes that the oxygen is running out and he does not have much time to survive. When he is contacted by the specialist in abduction Dan Brenner, Paul has high hopes to tracked by Dan and found in time. ""Buried"" is a claustrophobic and tense thriller with only one character and location and practically in real time. The plot uses a storyline similar to ""Phone Booth"" with a man trapped alone in a box having only a phone to contact the outside world, but in a pitch black with flashes of the location instead; therefore scarier than inside a phone booth. The viewer does not know exactly what is happening, and learns through the dialogs of the character. Ryan Reynolds has a great performance and succeeds in keeping the attention of the viewer along 95 minutes running time. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Enterrado Vivo"" (""Buried Alive"")",Buried

5,kosmasp,Keeping it up (or was that down?),8,15 November 2010,"There is a hip hop song called ""How low can you go?"". Of course they are talking about something different, but it could also be appropriate for this movie. Actually the premise is pretty much drawn out with the title, so there is not much to give away there. But what makes it unique though is the way it is shot.If you have read it, then you know what I mean, so I won't mention the USP (Unique selling Point) of the movie. The question is, is it possible to keep the tension high enough for the whole time with that premise? The answer is yes. And while you will either like or hate the idea, the movie has a decent flow and works quite fine. Let's say developments ""creep up on you"" (pun intended).A very good central performance, that holds the movie literally together (and everything else). Of course I wouldn't want to receive that cell phone bill ... But that's another (unsolved) story, that shouldn't actually matter ...",Buried
6,classicsoncall,"""It's over, isn't it?""",7,11 November 2019,"Well somebody, somewhere, thought this was a good idea for a movie treatment. Having only seen Ryan Reynolds in super-hero flicks (Green Lantern, Deadpool), I wasn't sure how he'd do in this story about a guy stuck in and buried in a coffin in the middle of the Iraqi desert. For about ninety five minutes you have to live and experience Paul Conroy's (Reynolds) desperate attempt to find a way out while the terrorist who's holding him hostage underground demands payment in exchange for his life and that of his fiancee in the outside world. If you have claustrophobia, you might have a little problem with this picture; besides the confined space it's mostly dark except for what light is provided by a cigarette lighter. With a cell phone left behind by the man who imprisoned him, Conroy does his best with limited means to think outside the box and call anyone who might be able to offer help. The twist ending suggests this story might have better been served in a slightly shortened format appearing in a venue like the 'Twilight Zone', or on second thought, make that 'Tales From the Crypt'.",Buried
7,jboothmillard,Buried,7,31 January 2011,"I saw one or two adverts on television, it was obviously a low budget picture, but the premise certainly looked a gripping one, as it is a situation no-one wants to be put in. Basically it is pitch black, there is breathing and a bit of banging, and eventually a cigarette lighter is lit by the protagonist, US army truck driver Paul Conroy (The Proposal's Ryan Reynolds). He is trapped inside an old fashion wooden coffin, at least six feet under ground, beneath the sands of the Iraq desert, he manages to get off his gag and binds, but he is all alone. Trying to find a way out, he rummages around in the small space he has, and he finds a working cell phone with enough signal, so he dials anyone he can think of who can help or he wants to speak to if anything bad happens. Paul starts with his wife and employers, both of which he has to leave messages for, so he tries the State Department, and he tries to explain his situation, but they do not sound like they can do much without knowing exactly where he is. So he then tries phoning the FBI, and he does eventually speak to an agent and again explains the situation, and he knows of course that he has been put there for a reason, not to die, but for ransom. In fact, soon he is rung by the Kidnapper (Juan Hidalgo and Abdelilah Ben Massou) himself, who is demanding $5,000,000 ransom from his employers for his release by a set time, this ransom is lowered to $1,000,000, but if he does't get them to pay he dies and so does someone he knows. Next Paul gets in contact with Dan Brenner (Robert Paterson), supposedly a man with expertise in kidnap situations, and it is only after hearing the name saved three weeks ago that he is seemingly happy to tell all. He makes sure to squeeze himself to the opposite side of the coffin where he finds a bag with a torch, glow sticks and a piece of paper with words written by the Kidnapper for him to read on video with the phone camera. After a call from the Kidnaapper telling him to make a video, which he refuses, the terrorist threatens the life of his co-worker if he doesn't do, so he agrees and quickly does it, while there is a little shaking and some sand filling, but not long he watches the co-worker shot dead. Paul takes the knife he has and considers suicide, cutting his throat, but he doesn't, and after an attack by a snake that somehow got in with him, which he defeats with his alcohol and fire, he gets a call from his employers, who tell him he was fired and his family won't get any insurance if he dies. (There is a point when he called his ill mother as well, but I can't remember what point that was.) When sand starts coming in faster and he is losing more air he makes a short last will video, and he says all he has to give is his clothes to his son and $700 from his savings to his wife. After sending the video, the Kidnapper calls again demanding blood instead of money to get released and have his family not be harmed, so Paul films himself cutting off his finger and sends it. Not long after Dan Brenner phones him to tell him they know where his buried and coming as fast as they can, and then Paul's wife Linda (Super Mario Bros.' Samantha Mathis) calls as well having heard what has happened. Sand is now rushing in and Paul is quickly running out of time and breathing space, he sees the rescue team bringing him out and sunlight, but sadly this was a hallucination. Not hearing any digging coming around him Paul gets the final cell phone cal in his last few seconds to live, Brenner says that the guy leading them has brought them to coffin of Mark Whie, the man he earlier claimed to have saved, and the final words Paul hears before death are ""I'm sorry Paul. I'm so sorry."" Also starring the voices of José Luis García Pérez as Jabir and Stephen Tobolowsky as Alan Davenport. If it wasn't for the voices on the cell phone this would be a one-man show, and probably boring, Reynolds plays the trapped and helpless everyman wanting to get out alive really well, even in this one location (bringing the spirit of Hitchcock films like Rope and Rear Window) there are some tense moments, there may be the odd improbability and repetitive dialogue, but it is a thriller certainly worth trying. Very good!",Buried
8,ma-cortes,"Spanish film by Rodrigo Cortes , starred by an American star and with international success",7,3 November 2011,"Original and ingeniously basic premise full of suspense and intrigue in spite of developing only one scenario.

With only a lighter and a cellphone it's a race against time to getaway this claustrophobic death trap . Paul must rely on his owns resources to survive , taking on serpent and burying .This freaky and clever film chronicles fear ,desperation, paranoia of a kidnapped trucker in Iraq who faces off a completely Kafkaesque situation . This is a thrilling film in which the abducted starring quest to find answers and solutions to why he's imprisoned and getting freedom . The buried trucker very well performed by Ryan Reynolds works utilizing his skills and talents to survive the deadly trap which guard the coffin with serpent and falling down included , as using his intelligence he attempts to avoid get smashed because the coffin is caving itself in .The picture succeeds because the thriller, tension , as well as a superbly written script delving into the human psyche in such extreme situation and our instinctive urges for survival . Despite low budget the picture manages to be intelligent, intriguing and thrilling. The good thing about this film is that the director made it on a shoestring budget only having to do one set , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . The trucker contacts by means of cellular phone with the outside world asking for help various characters , they are played -voices-by prestigious American secondaries as Stephen Tobolowski , Kali Rocha and Erik Palladino ; furthermore Samantha Mathis who plays another hostage .The interesting plot bears special resemblance to 'The cube' and ¨Fermat's room¨ but also there's a dangerously premise with strangers closed attempting to find an exit to exasperating situations. Good musical score fitting to tension by Victor Reyes who is also film producer . Fine cinematography , and naturally , plenty of dark and shades by Eduard Grau . The motion picture is originally directed by Rodrigo Cortes . Rating : Good , better than average .",Buried
9,paul_haakonsen,What a boring movie this was...,2,25 December 2010,"Alright, this movie was a major disappointment to me. Sure Ryan Reynolds did a good job in the role, but the plot of the movie was amazingly uninspiring and uneventful.I think it was very ambitious to have a movie based on this plot, and have it all take place in a small cramped coffin. A bold move indeed and a new way to make a movie. But it didn't really work for me, not for my liking.And also have a movie with just one face in it was a rather bold move, and I guess it worked on some levels, just not my level.This movie was one of the more boring and sleep-inducing movies I have tried to sit through. And I use the word 'tried' because I gave up just a bit over halfway through the movie. I couldn't take more of it, because nothing happened. You got nowhere in the movie.Definitely not my kind of movie, and even though Ryan Reynolds is a good actor, it was just too unbearable to sit through the entire movie. But hats off to those actually managing to do so.",Buried
10,Theo Robertson,Captive Politics,7,16 June 2013,"This is one of these films that works best when you have absolutely no knowledge about because it's going to be difficult keeping the ending a secret three years after the film was released . Unfortunately for me and a large proportion of people the bleak nihilistic ending became common knowledge via word of mouth very quickly . Does this mean it's not worth seeing if you know the ending ? Not necessarily because I enjoyed THE SIXTH SENSE despite knowing the ending to that movie before I saw it and BURIED isn't a film that relies one hundred per cent on its ending What the film is very good at is communicating the fear hope and despair of its protagonist Paul Conroy who after being captured by insurgents finds himself buried alive inside a coffin somewhere in Iraq . Commendably the producers have resisted the temptation that the action cuts between the protagonist and those trying to save him . But then you stop to realise this is probably down to budget . It's an independent production filmed in Barcelona so cutaways to offices in Washington and Baghdad and above surface in wartorn Iraq would have pushed up the budget , BURIED is a film that out of production necessity contains the narrative to one location of that of the interior of the coffin . That said it is a very effective claustrophobic drama that Hitchcock would have been proud of . Indeed the title gives gives a nod to the master of suspense , so much so you might expect the words "" Directed By Alfred Hitchcock "" to appear One aspect BURIED does touch upon is the politics of Iraq . There is some heavy handed commentary that becomes more and more pronounced as the story continues This seems to have alienated a few of the more respected commentators on this site and let's face it Paul's employers effectively stating "" Oh you're buried alive ? Oh sorry we've got to cancel your contract then - goodbye Mr Conroy "" doesn't ring true . Where the political subtext does work better is by having Dan Brenner the head of the Hostage Working Group played by a Briton . The Hostage Working Group was a 30 strong working group set up by the US State Department . It's unlikely a non American would be so prominent in this organization but yet the film makes the point that the invasion of Iraq was an Anglo/American alliance . The failure of Brenner to save Conroy can be seen as a failure of political will by the British to save the Southern sector of Iraq from violent Shia militias who imposed a reign of terror on the secular civilian population of that region , a situation only rectified by an American and Iraqi army led operation to eliminate the militias much to the humiliation of the British army In short this is a very effective low budget independent feature that'll stay in your memory and shows an audience and what can be done with a simple premise and a low budget . The politics of the film might be a bone of contention to some but let's face it - no one was apolitical when it came to the invasion of Iraq",Buried
11,zardoz-13,Much Ado A Box Nothing!,4,12 February 2011,"Don't delude yourself with this dreadful drivel! Spanish director Rodrigo Cortés and scenarist Chris Sparling take a surefire predicament straight out of the annals of horror writer Edgar Allan Poe about an individual trapped inextricably in a coffin and take it for a grim 21st century spin. Poe lived in fear that he would appear to die and his apparently lifeless body would prompt authorities to consign him to a coffin. Later, he would wake up underground with nowhere to go and nobody to save him. The death-like trance that obsessed Poe is called catalepsy, and America's foremost horror author penned his memorable short story ""The Premature Burial"" about it. Moviegoers who haven't read the Poe story or seen an adaptation might favorably compare ""Buried"" to either French director George Sluizer's intense abduction chiller ""The Vanishing"" (1988) or his American remake of it with Jeff Bridges in 1993. The thing that sets the flawed Cortés apart from it is that everything occurs in the coffin in ""Buried."" In ""Buried,"" an innocent, average, blue-collar, working-class guy, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds of ""Blade Trinity""), awakens with a jolt to find himself entombed in a wooden crate buried six feet underground with no way to escape. Our hero has no idea how he wound up in the coffin. During a brief inventory, he discovers that he has a Zippo lighter, his Hamilton wristwatch, some glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, a knife, and a Blackberry cell phone with a battery that needs a recharge. Desperately, Paul tries to contact anybody who can rescue him, but he gets either answering machine messages or busy signals. Eventually, he contacts a 911 operator, an FBI agent, and later on an Embassy employee with a British accent. In every instance, he has to indulge his contacts with an explanation about his incredible situation and admittedly gets very rude and profane with them when they ask him imbecilic questions.As it turns out, Paul worked as a civilian contractor driving a truck in Iraq in 2006. Insurgents attacked his convoy, massacring everybody else, but they spared Paul for something infinitely worse. They took him hostage while he was still unconscious and buried him alive. Indeed, Paul doesn't know where they have buried him. The villains give him an ultimatum. Not only must he make a YouTube video with a script written out for him, but he also must raise $5 million for his ransom. Moreover, Paul has only about two hours to complete this onerous task before he exhausts air in his coffin. Just to emphasize the hopelessness of his predicament, Cortés and Sparling reveal that our hero only has $700 in his bank account. Paul is a nobody with a wife and a young son.Mind you, the suspense and tension that Cortes and Sparling generate is of the intense, white-knuckled variety, and ""Buried"" is pretty gripping until the bottom falls out during last few moments and the tension dissolves in a heartbeat. There is nothing mesmerizing, brilliant, or groundbreaking about this cynical bit of manipulation. Worse, Cortés and Sparling stick in moments that defy credibility. At one point, a poisonous black snake slithers out of our protagonist's pants and curls up in the far corner of the coffin. How did the snake get into the coffin, especially since our doomed hero slams his body around in the enclosure for at least a half-hour or moment in an act of hysterical madness? The surprise, in a sense, is that the snake didn't bite Paul. The reptile crawls away and never returns.Ultimately, the payoff in ""Buried"" comes as a horrendous letdown. In a memorable suspense thriller, the filmmakers often reward the audience for their extreme patience, but Cortes and Sparling provide nothing in the way of relief. They provide an ending that serves only to frustrate us for watching a sympathetic character suffer a fate beyond anything that is imaginable. The only catharsis in ""Buried"" is that there is no catharsis, just a cop-out of the most misguided sort. Indeed, the formula for a good movie involves the use of surprises and reversals. The ending here qualifies as a surprise, but it is the kind of surprise that makes you wish that you had never seen this movie.Ryan Reynolds does a commendable job of winning our approbation. Sadly, the protagonist emerges as nothing more than a pawn of corporate America, vengeful Iraqis, and derisive filmmakers. The company that employed our hero terminates him the day that the insurgents abducted and confined him in the coffin because he had violated a non-fraternization clause. Apparently, Paul engaged in some kind of relationship with another employee. ""Buried"" treats its hero with a complete lack of compassion. You will feel cheated by the depressing ending. Presumably, Lionsgate did not release ""Buried"" to theaters after they promoted the 95-minute film because studio executives feared that the wretched wrap-up would alienate audiences rather than entertain them.Aside from Reynolds' convincing portrait of claustrophobic hysteria under dire conditions, actor Stephen Tobolowsky makes the greatest impression as CRT company representative Alan Davenport who strings poor Paul along in one scene about a contract violation. Unless you enjoy movies that paint you into a corner that not even Houdini could have gotten out of, ""Buried"" with its muddled conspiratorial world politics and heavily accented villain is not worth the anxiety. What could have been a terrific movie turns out to be just a cinematic gimmick about a guy in a box. Nevertheless, Cortés and company produced this low-budget melodrama for $2 million and it has raked in $18-million, making it a hit despite its limited showings.",Buried
12,grantss,"Minimalist yet highly original, intriguing and tension-filled",8,1 June 2016,"Paul Conroy (played by Ryan Reynolds) awakes to find himself in a wooden box, buried underground. He is a civilian contractor and truck-driver in Iraq. His convoy was ambushed and he was taken captive and buried alive. He has a limited amount of air, giving him a limited time to find a way out. All he has to aid him in this task is his cigarette lighter, a torch, a mobile phone and his will to live.Minimalist yet highly original, intriguing and tension-filled.Probably the most minimalist movie ever made. The entire movie is filmed inside a wooden box, a wooden box with one occupant (well, one human occupant...). One actor - Ryan Reynolds - has 100% of the screen time, though there are voices of other actors involved.Incredibly engrossing and tension-filled. Until the very last moment you don't know how things are going to work out.

13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Originality,7,24 July 2011,"A man wakes up in a coffin, with a lighter and a cell phone with him. This is all you should know going into this. Yes, this sticks to this one setting, and it is all filmed from inside. If you have claustrophobia and/or you do not wish to spend the entirety of this in close proximity to Reynolds(settle down, girls), skip it. Ryan tends to play... himself, cracking jokes, and he does so here as well, and it works, as usual. Without the humor, it would have been too dry, and the acidic wit does add to the feeling of helplessness. Some will like him, others will not. The writing varies, and the commentary is quite heavy-handed. While most of the danger does work, a few things feel like they're there just to ensure that this passes the 90 minute mark(it does, just barely). Certain things are established and then altered, and it comes off as if they needed to up the stakes near the end... and frankly, this keeps things really vague, to the point where you are unsure about what is the case and what isn't, about too many things(some of them vital to the impact this has). The acting is very good. Dialog is realistic and usually not overly expository. There is some strong language and a little brutal, disturbing content(that almost feels out of place). The DVD comes with an 18 minute informational and amusing making of with clips of the two 4-minute interviews(one with the star, one with the director, both interesting enough albeit with oddly poor audio quality), and four trailers(Saw: The Final Chapter, The Way Back, The Kids Are Alright, Get Low).

He has a zippo lighter and a cell phone, and discovers he is in a wooden box, roughly coffin sized. What follows is the story of Paul in the box.This film must hold the record for the smallest location ever for an entire film - the whole film takes place in the box. And it is gripping throughout, an excellent example of an effective movie made on a very small budget. Different and credible light sources are introduced as the movie progresses, and none feels artificially engineered into the story. The claustrophobia of the box becomes a character.The story develops well, the developments are not always expected (I sat there thinking ""Why is he wasting phone battery on that?"" believing that this was a set up for the phone to fail at a critical moment, but I needn't have worried) and, while the ending was a possibility I had considered, it was also one I had discounted, and it is very well dressed up and presented.There are several genuinely chilling moments (of which the Alan Davenport moment is the worst).

15,ferguson-6,5 Million Money,7,25 September 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. My comments about last week's ""Devil"" dwelled on the aspect of claustrophobia in being stranded in a stuck elevator with strangers. Forget all that! In this compelling film, Ryan Reynolds wakes up in an enclosed coffin. With a head injury. Buried. In Iraq. With a cell phone. And a lighter. This takes claustrophobia and anxiety attacks to a whole new level.Somehow writer Chris Sparling, director Rodrigo Cortes and Ryan Reynolds all bought off on the idea that the ENTIRE FILM should be shot from within the coffin. That's correct. There are no flashbacks to Paul's (Ryan Reynolds) home life or the convoy ambush. There are no scenes of the FBI working the phones. There are no scenes of the kidnappers in some darkened basement. None of that. Just Reynolds in his wooden coffin.Paul Conroy, an American contractor working in Iraq, wakes up in a coffin. His kidnappers have provided a cell phone and inform him that he will be released only if they are paid ""5 million money"". Paul spends the rest of the film frantically trying to arrange for the ransom by contacting his family, his employer, the FBI and the State Department. I will say no more other than I found my breathing getting quick and shallow and my palms sweaty just watching the plight of this unfortunate man.There are no outside scenes, not counting a very short, disturbing video the kidnappers send him through the cell phone. The phone conversations are fascinating. You will voice-recognize the great Stephen Tobolowsky as the personnel director performing some quick legal ass-covering. You might also recognize the voice of Tess Harper as Maryann - presumable the mother of Paul's wife as he tries to make contact. Neither of these are warm fuzzies, but both add to the heightened stress level and desperation.This is not really a film we would want to watch a second time, but interesting enough, I could see it becoming a cult fixture similar to Rocky Horror. The audience could show up with their cell phone, a lighter, a flask and a couple of other props that I won't disclose here. Sometimes the best way to handle fear is to laugh in its face. Oh, and answer your cell when loved one's call. Lastly ... I don't want to be buried alive.",Buried
16,gradyharp,The Erosion of Hope,10,23 January 2011,"BURIED is not a film for everyone. It is a very cerebral piece that requires the audience to enter into a place that is terrifyingly desperate, grow to know the many messages that the main character represents, and be willing to experience a very non-Hollywood ending. Written with great courage by Chris Sparling and directed with consummate skill by young Spanish director Rodrigo Cortés, this film is a challenge for the single character in the film and Ryan Reynolds reaches one of the highest achievements of his career. The time is 2006 in Iraq and Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) works for a trucking company as a contracted civilian. His convoy is attacked and many of his fellow non-military workers are killed: Paul is placed in a coffin and buried, with only a cigarette lighter and a cellphone. The film begins in the dark, that same dark that surrounds the entrapped Paul who realizes he has limited oxygen supply and must find a way to escape or meet death. He tries to use the cellphone, but encounters the usual monstrous difficulties we all face daily - automated answering machines, operators who insist on unnecessary information before helping him, futile attempts to connect with his family, calls from his attackers demanding ransom to set him free, contact with the government departments who shuffle his requests until the appropriate person is reached who is unable to correctly assist, calls from his employer in the States who demands he give a recorded message relinquishing his rights and firing him for groundless reasons. Throughout the 90 minutes that we spend with Paul in the coffin we feel the terror, hear the explosions, feel the agony as he speaks briefly with his wife, leaves a cellphone video for his son, and says goodbye to his nursing home mother suffering from dementia. The ending of the film must be withheld, as it is unexpected. What the writer and the director and the actor have managed to do in this claustrophobic nightmare is point out many facts about the US involvement in the Middle East - both military and civilian contractors - and hear the reasons behind the situation from the Middle Eastern viewpoint. It is a very difficult movie to experience but one that is a brilliantly condensed statement about the madness of war. Ryan Reynolds delivers a performance completely solo and manages to create a wholly unforgettable, completely compelling character that will never leave our mind. Grady Harp",Buried
17,trashgang,"Simple story, excellent camera tricks",6,6 March 2011,"It's a bit hard to review this special movie. You can't go into special effects because there were non. You can't say anything about the cast because it's just one person you see. And the set is simple too, just a coffin. Yes, indeed, it all takes place in a coffin. So that's already tricky to watch because I know a lot of people who didn't liked it because there was nothing to see or watch and I must agree with them. It takes indeed almost an hour before the suspense comes in. The first hour you will learn everything about the character, perfectly played by Ryan Reynolds. But it's all done on phone. Of course, being buried you can't do anything else than phone but for me it was a bit too long, an hour as I said. But from then on it goes faster and things go from worse to terribly wrong. The ending was a surprise for me. I won't spoil it just watch it. Still, I won't state it as a horror either a suspense or thriller. But you have to experience the coffin setting to sit it through.

I would buy the film if the coffin scene was only half the film, but the whole film kills the movie. Boring! The viewer would like to see the face of the terrorist etc, but no such luck! Reynold's acting keeps the film half interesting, but even Reynolds acting cannot save this film. The ending is disappointing! I gave the film a 6 out of 10, because of the first half.

I can't recall how many films in the last few years had attempted something as daring and audacious as Buried, but writer Chris Sparling and director Rodrigo Cortes pulled this thriller off wonderfully, aided by the performance of Ryan Reynolds, who single handedly demonstrates his acting range that continues to cement him as one of my favourite character actors (from films like Waiting... to Definitely, Maybe) and before he takes flight in next year's expected effects extravaganza in The Green Lantern, he first gets his wings clipped and finds himself grounded, a few feet under.Reynolds stars as Paul Conroy, a truck driver working for a conglomerate who gets sent by his company to Iraq to work. En route to his convoy's delivery of supplies in rebuilding efforts, the group gets jumped by terrorists/insurgents/criminals, and he finds himself buried in a box underground, which is where we find him when the film opens, unaware of where he is, and anxious to get out. With him are a few items which to reveal will spoil the fun, but suffice to say there's a Blackberry included in the package.This is no Kill Bill where The Bride can hammer her way out of a boxed coffin through the use of martial arts taught by Bai Mei. Here it's as real as it can get, with the bad guys giving you enough so as to control you to do their bidding, yet with the same tools serving as a double edged sword, especially when efforts to reach help are concerned. The story engages at a very personal level since it's a one man tour de force with little external distractions, and I suppose anyone caught in the same situation will probably employ some of the same techniques here when desperately seeking help to escape.Writer Chris Sparling and director Rodrigo Cortes crafts a simple yet effective story that will put you on the edge together with his protagonist, allowing you to experience almost everything he does, from frustrations when interacting with external parties in scenarios which we are all too familiar with, yet understanding and grasping the impact that such issues bring forth if we're in the same shoes. It's very gutsy of him to set it all in a singular location that is sans any beautiful images, and employing inventive techniques to keep the visuals fresh, yet providing enough to share that sense of claustrophobia and confinement within the small physical dimensions. The story also throws up scenarios that will pump that adrenaline so that there's never a dull moment.Ryan Reynolds deserves all the kudos for a fine performance delivered. You can imagine how audiences can get turned off if they don't share the same emotions experienced along the way, and this spans a spectrum from exasperation to that resignation of fate. He screams, he cries, and he relies on his wit to stay alive, and I thought Buried was that perfect opportunity presented for him to show he's quite the actor ready to take on bigger, leading roles, without the need to don a costume to serve as a masked avenger. The supporting cast providing those faceless voices at the other end of the line also deserve some credit in logically expanding the universe of this film, without which it'll literally be one man talking to himself.I believe local audiences here need to grow up. It doesn't mean that when the screen goes blank the projectionist is at fault. Stop the silly giggles and comments, and open your eyes and ears for the first signs the show is indeed in progress. Stay until after the end credits for a quick shot of the coffin interior panning to a ""Mark White"" inscription. Needless to say, this film is highly recommended for its bold vision and fine execution, which I suspect may start a trend of similar films soon, like how first-person type films have become popular.",Buried
20,namashi_1,Stuck And Hating It!,5,12 January 2011,"A film like 'Buried' leaves you numb in your seat. Watching a bruised man locked up in a coffin throughout the film, exhausts, disturbs and shatters you. Filmmaker Rodrigo Cortés succeeds by making a horrifying fare.'Buried' is 90-minutes long in duration, but the filmmaker makes you feel each second of the torture his Hero goes through. Ryan Reynolds is the only actor in this feature, there is not a single soul that is shown properly over-here.What I found commendable in here, is that, despite only 1 actor appearing in it, and knowing that the entire film is shot in a coffin, the writing is tight in the initial portions. The first 35-40 minutes unfold beautifully, but sadly, the final 30-minutes are a complete mess. If a better last hour, this attempt would been a must watch. Rodrigo Cortés's direction carries a look, while the Cinematography is chilling. Ryan Reynolds is fantastic. The actor holds you with his performance, even when the writing lets him down. This Golden Opportunity of performing alone in the entire film, has been completely justified by this supremely talented actor! On the whole, as my summary correctly points out, the guy is Stuck And Hating It! And as a viewer, all you do is watch him suffer and battle beneath closed doors. I don't know weather I'll watch this film again, but it's a film, that will haunt me whenever I talk about it. It's a film that has left me in extreme emotions.",Buried
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Your worst nightmare: Buried,8,7 May 2012,"While at another Blockbuster store that was about to close down, I picked up a few movies, one of them being Buried. I remember seeing the trailer and thought it looked interesting but was curious what the movie was like. Ryan Reynolds is one of those hit or miss actors, you still love the guy, but he's not the greatest actors and hasn't been given that one break that could title him in the good acting category. I watched the film last night and I have to say this is a film that has stuck in my head for the day. Very rarely do we have a film that takes chances like this film did where it truly captures the claustrophobia and really does not let go on the tension. Ryan is the only actor we see in the flesh and he carries the film very well in this heart breaking and terrifying story.Paul Conroy, a US truck driver in Iraq, awakens buried alive in a wooden coffin, with only a Zippo and a cell phone. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he soon starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that he and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed the other truck drivers. After finding the cellphone. Paul is able to contact the FBI, but they cut off before he can explain the situation. Conroy's kidnapper phones him and demands a ransom of $5 million to release him alive, which is later lowered to $1 million. Conroy eventually gets into contact with the State Department, who pass him onto a hostage rescue group led by Dan Brenner. It's just a matter of time before Paul can keep it together enough for Dan to save him, but the real question is: is Paul worth the risk? You'll have to see to find out.As we are trapped with Paul through the story, you can't help but feel for him. You put yourself in that situation and can't imagine the pain and horror of what he is going through. I think everyone has had a nightmare of being buried alive, you have two choices: die of suffocation or starvationeither way it's slow and you have to wait to die. So naturally you're connecting with Paul, but then it's when you get to know his situation that you really start to feel for him. He's just a normal guy who is trying to make money for his family and was in the wrong place at the wrong time. You also know how the American government works when it comes to terrorist negotiations, it's not pleasant to think about.The funny thing about this film is that I was telling my boyfriend that it had a Hitchcock feel to it and what do you know? Rodrigo Cortés was inspired by Rope, a fantastic film by Hitchcock, to make this film. I think he captured just about everything perfectly about a man who's been buried alive and doing everything in his limited power to survive. The lighting, the acting and the claustrophobic atmosphere just really gets to you and is very well done. Ryan did a good job in keeping us with him during his struggle to live and through the whole story he keeps you going making you wonder if he'll make it out OK or not. Buried is a heart breaking and terrifying story that you would never want to find yourself trapped in.8/10",Buried

This movie actually reminded me of ""Phone Booth"" a lot, although I liked ""Phone Booth"" a bit more than this movie. It still got my attention, not in the beginning but slowly and gradually it started to pull me in. It's one the the cheapest movie I have ever seen, but it's crafted so well I didn't care at all about that. The plot is about Paul Conroy(Ryan Reynolds) who is trapped in a coffin and buried with just a few items including his cellphone who has to use every thing he has in order to try and survive. This movie is suspenseful and claustrophobic and trying to figure out what the heck is going on is a treat. I really didn't expect this movie to take place entirely in a coffin, I thought some parts are in the coffin and the other parts outside of the coffin. But all of it takes place inside the coffin, which makes the movie even more daring and original. Overall it's a ballsy movie that is crafted very well although for a long period of time there really isn't that much tension.7.3/10",Buried
24,sddavis63,Uncomfortable & Unnerving - But It Also Gets A Bit Tiresome As It Goes On,8,13 March 2013,"It's very difficult to pull off what is almost totally a one man show and make it worthwhile to watch, but Ryan Reynolds needs to be credited for pulling it off rather well. He plays Paul Conroy in this - an American civilian truck driver who's taken a job in Iraq to make some money for his family when he ends up in a living nightmare. He's kidnapped, thrown into a coffin and buried alive somewhere in the desert. That's where the movie begins - Paul waking up inside the coffin. There's not a single scene in this movie set outside the coffin, and aside from a few voices (because Paul has a cell phone that he can use to contact the outside world) Paul is the only character we're introduced to. He desperately tries phoning anyone. Friends and loved ones - but he gets mostly answering machines. US police and government agencies, who don't seem to take his plight very seriously. Meanwhile, his air is running out and the coffin is starting to give way to the weight of the sand on it, and Paul's essentially waiting to die.This is an uncomfortable, unnerving and extremely claustrophobic movie. It manages to raise a few issues about the mindset of the kidnappers (and, presumably, other extremists in Iraq) although I can't say that the kidnappers were turned in any way into objects of sympathy. Reynolds needs to be both good and believable to make this work - and he is. You do share his increasing desperation as the movie goes on. And yet, I have to say that as this went on it also became a little bit tiresome and repetitive. There's really only so much you can do with the basic story. You can only watch a man panic and get more and more desperate for so long before you start tuning out a little bit. So, it was a good decision to keep this fairly short, at 1:35. Longer than that would have been too much. This certainly isn't a movie for claustrophobics to watch, and it's not a movie that you'd want to watch twice (at least I wouldn't.) But it is certainly worth watching once. (8/10)",Buried
25,Hellmant,Nothing short of a creative cinematic masterpiece; hard to watch but definitely worth seeing!,9,25 October 2010,"'BURIED': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Ryan Reynolds turns in one of the best performances of the year in this white knuckle claustrophobic thriller. The film was shot on a mere $3 million budget (a large portion of which probably went to pay Reynold's salary, which I'm sure was a big pay cut for him) and takes place entirely in one location, a coffin. Unlike movies like 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' and 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2' (which had approximately the same budget) this movie is extremely well written (by Chris Sparling) and brilliantly directed (by Spanish filmmaker Rodrigo Cortes); it uses it's involving story to fascinate it's audience in very creative visual ways and never lets up. It moves at a break neck speed and keeps the viewer at the edge of it's seat the entire time as well as emotionally drenched. A pretty impressive feat for a movie shot on such a low budget about a guy moving around in a box the entire film! In the film Reynolds plays a US contract truck driver on assignment in Iraq who awakes to find himself buried somewhere in a coffin (as the film opens) with only a cellphone and a lighter. Initially he's blacked out and hasn't a clue how he got there but he starts to remember that his convoy was attacked by insurgents and all the other truck drivers were shot and killed. He frantically calls his family and employers but only gets answering machines and later makes contact with the F.B.I., who he discovers is much more worried about protecting their (and the US government's) image than his safety. He also makes contact with his kidnapper and learns that he's being held for a $5 million ransom or he will be left in the coffin to die. He realizes that he has a fleeting amount of oxygen left and desperately tries to use what little time and resources he has to find a way out of the coffin and survive.Some viewers who demand more standard popcorn action movie fare will be bored by the film but many other film fans (like myself) will be captivated by it. In my opinion this is one of the greatest examples of a purely artistic motion picture success. Like I said the directing, writing and especially acting (Reynolds deserves an Oscar nomination come awards time) are genius. It's the type of movie that proves what creative original film making is all about, a beautiful homage to the Hitchcock films that inspired it. It's also a tear jerking, gut wrenching emotional roller coaster with some very insightful and timely political commentary. It's a dark and depressing film but also a touching tale of the will to survive. Nothing short of a creative cinematic masterpiece; hard to watch but definitely worth seeing.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffxjYiwLUko",Buried
26,thesar-2,Bury This,4,1 December 2012,"Sure, you would be scared too, if you're Buried alive. It's happened before in the movies. But, to me, and a lot of my fan(s), I'm referring to The Bride (Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Vol. 2.)Sure, since that was fiction, she knew how to escape. She pounded the roof of the wooden coffin in the ground with her fist until it broke and dirt escaped into the tomb. Once enough poured in, she literally dug her way upwards to safety so she can go and request water in a nearby café.Again, that was fiction. And The Bride had training – who knew she would need to pound her fists for that very reason? But this guy, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is supposed to be a more realistic ""trucker"" for some made-up company in Iraq during the beginning stages of the rebuilding of Iraq during Bush's regime. His crew was ambushed, killed and/or maimed and he was stored in a wooden casket to be held for ransom.Let's be frank: he's a dick. Sure, he's in extraordinary circumstances, but he's still a prick. Let's stop there for a bit, shall we? Let's back up. This guy, Paul, is a trucker for some company and stupidly thinks there's easy money to be made inTHEE MOST UNSAFEST PLACE IN ALL OF THE WORLD. Then he's caught and buried for ransom.I hope this doesn't happen in real lifebut I'm sure it does.to .003% of the world's population. So, we're supposed to relate to him?Anyhoo, the movie begins as he awakes in the literal coffin. But wait! He's given all the right tools to coordinate himself out.Unfortunately, we get to know him as he's suffering through this ordeal. Can we really side with him? How often will this happen to the normal folk, like us, where we really feel ""oh, this could happen to us?""Not often, I suspect. Further, since we can't really put ourselves in this guy's shoes, would we really act like the (sorry, again) dick he is?Okay, the ending really does shock, surprise and (sadistically) impress me. But, not enough to hold up for the whole feature. In a REAL life situation, simply watch 127 Hours for more realism and acting. Poor Ryan Reynolds. At least he tried at acting. Maybe he should just stick with being a (more) fictional Super-hero.On a side noteas grim as it was – no, I've never been buried alivethank God – all I could think of throughout this featureWhy doesn't he start pounding the rooftop until his fist(s) bleed? I mean then, he could dig-dug his way to the surface like The Bride did. After all, they specifically told him he wasn't too far from ground level.",Buried
27,MLDinTN,big payoff at the end,7,27 February 2012,"I thought for the most part that this movie was believable. You know that terrorists kidnap Americans in the Middle East, so I thought it was plausible that they kidnap a guy and bury him in a coffin demanding a ransom. So, Paul, a truck driver, wakes up in a coffin with just a lighter and cell phone. The one thing not believable is that he is able to use the phone underground to call the US, even 911. It doesn't appear to be some kind of satellite phone. Anyways, Paul talks to his kidnappers and forced to make videos. He also talks to a British guy in Irag that is trying to find him in time. Then at the end, you think the whole thing is coming to a resolution, only to find out Paul is tricked in the end.

Except for a short cell phone video Reynolds is the only person we see in the movie. But much like Tom Hanks in ""Castaway"" he is enough to carry it alone and you forget you only see him. I know what your thinking...how good can a movie be if it only has one person in it the entire time with only a lighter and a cell phone. The answer is simple. Fantastic! This movie feels so real, (the claustrophobia aspect helps) that it is the most tense I've been while watching a movie since I can't remember. You are right there feeling his frustration and outright anger at the people he calls you want to throw something at the screen. Not to give anything away, but the ending will leave you breathless.

Unfortunately, the film is not much better than 90 minutes of blank screen. The whole film takes place inside a casket, which means Reynolds is the whole show.

34,The-Sarkologist,A dark movie about the horror of death,9,5 November 2011,"This is a really scary movie, particularly for people who have no hope. Ryan Reynolds is a civilian contractor in Iraq who drives trucks, but he is caught in an ambush and wakes up in a coffin buried somewhere in the desert, and all he has is a mobile phone and a zippo lighter. The question is how does he escape.The phone allows him to contact the outside world, but also allows the outside world to contact him, however since he is somewhere under thousands of miles of desert, the chance of him being able to escape is slim indeed. What we are watching is the last couple of hours of his life, and the panic that whelms up inside of him as he approaches death.Many of us fear death, and the horror of this movie is how we know that we will die and that there is nothing that we can do about it. While most of us are able to put the thought of death to the back of our mind, and to live our life without considering the fact that the date of our death is ever so slowly creeping up on us, this is not the case for Ryan Reynolds. He is trapped, and he himself is unable to do anything about it (I considered that he could attempt to dig himself out, but that is probably not possible).The question that I asked myself as I watched this movie was how would I react, and how will we end up dying. The first way is that we will slowly run out of oxygen and die in a coma, the other, more likely way, is that the weight of the sand above the coffin will eventually crush us. Either way, the time left for us would be short indeed. What would I do? Well, being a Christian, I would spend those last hours of my life in prayer, praying for myself, the world, and the friends and family that I know, and the people that I don't, that when their hour of death finally arrives, that the hope that they have in the Lord Jesus will mean that the fear of death will not be as strong or as horrific.",Buried

36,sol-,Burial Ground,7,7 March 2017,"After waking up inside a shallowly buried coffin, an American truck driver finds himself in a race against time to contact the outside world before his oxygen runs out in this thriller set in Iraq. It is an intriguing scenario and while not everything about it adds up (particularly how he swings his pocket lighter around without ever setting the wooden box alight), the film is powered through due the Kafkaesque dilemmas that its protagonist experiences, finding himself constantly put on hold, transferred, fobbed with excuses and told to calm down whenever he phones the outside world. The film additionally benefits from a powerful turn by a stressed out Ryan Reynolds and while some of the drama he experiences (especially a creature that enters his coffin) feels improbable, the film generally avoids feeling like it is stretching the simple premise beyond its limits. The phone conversations that he has with his kidnapper also add a remarkable extra layer of complexity with the kidnapper's unwillingness to believe the US government will not pay a ransom to rescue him, though the most potent conversation comes from Reynolds talking to the head of his company who slowly reveals himself to be ice cold unsympathetic. The film is topped off with a memorable ending too that long lingers in the mind and which solidly grounds the film in reality despite all the aforementioned unlikely elements. The premise of 'Buried' might seem like a gimmick more than anything else - and it very well may be - but it spins a surprisingly riveting tale from it.",Buried
37,Rodrigo_Amaro,Claustrophobic and awesome experience with Ryan Reynolds,10,24 March 2011,"2010 was the year of films with one actor in desperate moments, one man show in thrilling films: James Franco in the excellent ""127 Hours"" and Ryan Reynolds in ""Buried"". The main difference between these two films is that Reynolds is really alone in the film, his other co-stars can only be heard through a cellphone (ironically, this was the only object Franco needed to save his life faster and he didn't brought one in the cave).Reynolds plays Paul, a truck driver kidnapped in Iraq, confused as an American soldier, and kept buried inside a coffin with a lighter, a cellphone, a pen and few other objects without knowing why he's there. Desperate, anxious, totally out of control Paul will try to do whatever he can to get out of there and save his life. He calls to his home; his bosses; the State Departament; a leader of rescue team with the mission of helping guys in his situation during American occupation in Iraq; and several other people who might help him or not. But, at last, he discovers that he was kidnapped and the guy will try to get some money out of him in trade of taking him out of the ground. He doesn't have much time, he's shorter of breath, shorter of battery in the cellphone and shorter of patience, but will he get out of this horrendous situation alive? Claustrophobic and darkest in the most possible scariest degree, ""Buried"" is a thrilling film that spends all of its time in a tight and closed coffin, where its almost impossible to see the main character, except when he uses the cellphone, or uses the lighter. What makes the tension work here is the surprises thrown on Reynolds character, we think for most of the time that he's trapped in half nelson situation, he can't go to anywhere and he can't do anything, and things get worse and worse in a unthinkable way. For instance, when a snake appears on the coffin scaring the hell out of him; or when his boss (voice by Stephen Tobolowsky) at first tries to get information of him, try to help him to than later fire the guy for reasons that are better not be mentioned here. At the same time the screenplay knows how to surprise, stunning the viewers with a great precision, it also has a few things that are very concerning, such as the Paul find out that he had a knife (almost one hour trapped in the coffin) and he didn't tried to use it to get out of there. A reviewer here said something about the use of a pen, Paul makes several notes on the telephone numbers he gets, and this reviewer said something about the pen, quoting that Paul couldn't use a pen in the ground blaming the gravity. Pure nonsense, he's not in orbit, but the writer could make Paul's pen run out of ink when he needed the most, something thrilling could be made with this object on scene and he missed an great opportunity to make the film a little longer, built more suspense instead of putting too many obscure shots with an excessive fade out effect.If you were uncomfortable with Bride's segment while buried in a coffin in ""Kill Bill - Vol.2"" get ready to be even more in another box for almost two hours along with Ryan Reynolds. The movie succeeds in putting us there, fearing Paul's anguish and terror (specially in the final minutes). Ryan has a good dramatic performance (the movie couldn't go on without a few jokes, the guy is a first class comedian) considering the limitation of mobility of his character and the way we must see him, without being too distant from him, barely seeing his face but terrified with his screams (a little too much at times). It is a great film, has brilliant moments, it is very tense, dramatic, well made. Please, don't read the negative reviews from people here, they are missing the point, overlooking pointless details and demanding too much of a simple film. 10/10",Buried
38,Floated2,Slightly thrilling but far too predictable,5,19 January 2011,"Buried is a simple plot driving thriller. About a man- Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) stuck in a coffin deep in the ground. Its premise is there, but overall the film seems to fail to bring any big thrills or surprises. It was awfully straight forward in its approach and ended in a let-down. The film is roughly 90 mins but feels a little longer. Most of the time, Reynolds was calling different agencies and companies for help with his blackberry, or using his lighter to see what was going on. Buried is basically a unique one-of a life time type dream-come-true showcase for an actor, and Ryan Reynolds does a good job of rising to the occasion, proving he has acting skills beyond his best-known roles in wacky comedies and overblown action movies. Reynolds gives it all he has, but even so, there's just not enough material here to sustain a 90-minute movie. Also, I didn't really find Reynolds character to be that likable. He seemed a little rude at certain moments- yelling and shouting the F word to the agencies trying to help him. Had his character been more likable, more sincere and charismatic, I think the audiences would have felt his pain more, and it would have been easier to root for him in the end. I think the major problem with the film was the fact that I read somewhere that Reynolds character doesn't survive in the end, before watching the film. I guess it really took away from the suspense knowing how the end would happen. I didn't like the ending at all. To me, it seemed like a massive cop-out. I think they should have made him survived in a twist-ending type fashion. Buried has some good acting, decent thrills but just wasn't enough for me So overall, I was disappointed.",Buried

To have a camera freely moving with a person inside such a compact space is an achievement in itself. The story is about truck driver Paul Conroy who wakes up gagged, buried and running out of oxygen. He is forced to figure out how he got there where his survival skills are put to the ultimate test. What I admired was the balance of fear, thrills and dark comedy. In a situational film where character development is pushed aside, it is imperative that our lead character is likeable so that it is worth investing the time. They could be running through fire, swimming in shark infested waters or even drifting endlessly in space, if we can't relate to the character on an emotional level then there is no point. At all. After a slight rushed start, I can say this film worked. All thanks to Ryan Reynolds with one of his best performances by far. Multiple layers to his character that were well expressed. Laughing in times of crisis, angry in times of frustration and emotional in times of solace. He made Paul Conroy human. I sympathised with him and the situation he was in. Forget about the solitude of being in a tiny dark coffin, this film teaches you not how to survive in circumstances like this...no no. It teaches you how absolutely infuriating being put on hold is. My word it is the worst! So yes, I felt Conroy's rage and would've reacted the same way. There were times where the story dragged but it was bound to happen. Creating a 95 minute story in one small location is an achievement. Cortés' direction was so tight! He impressively captures the feeling of claustrophobia using low lighting and consistent shots of the walls, highlighting the sense of being trapped. The musical score didn't work for me, would've preferred silence. But a damn decent thriller with an outstanding performance.",Buried
40,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"When it's not criticizing society, ""Buried"" thrives despite the obvious confines",7,18 February 2011,"Give Rodrigo Cortes credit: movie aside, few people could stand the thought of 90 minutes in a box with Ryan Reynolds. Not to jab at Reynolds' talent, but most of his roles wear thin during the course of a movie and you can actually empathize with Paul Conroy. A Michigan- based truck driver, he's on a routine delivery in Iraq when he gets kidnapped by some insurgents and buried in a wooden coffin with seemingly nothing but a cellphone and a lighter. We don't get to see the kidnapping part, just the coffin, which makes for the film's challenge: make lots with little.Good thing for the cellphone, as there's no story without it. Buried not too far underground so that he can get a signal and communicate with his captor as well as anyone else he chooses, much of the conflict scoots by on our imagining of the voice on the other end; it's our chance to escape the claustrophobia of the film.Personally, a shorter film with a bit more claustrophobia would have been more effective. Cortes makes us grow just as restless and impatient as Conroy, who conveniently has anxiety issues permitting outbursts of swearing to provide some needed noise, but ""Buried"" loses the effectiveness of its premise a bit with some of the social commentary of Chris Sparling's script. The film would have escaped as an effective mood piece with cries of a acclaim for Cortes had it focused solely on a guy in a box trying to save his life. Instead, Sparling dips us in and out of his criticism of the system and how its image to millions ranks higher than saving one individual life. A valid argument all things considered, but a bit counteracting to the purposes of ""Buried"" in terms of thrills.Cortes scores points visually and in terms of suspense. Each light-emitting item in the coffin creates a different ""color"" and as such it affords him some creative wiggle-room to more directly influence audience reaction through lighting. On a couple occasions he pulls away from Reynolds and breaks the illusion of the audience being right there in the box with him, presumably allowing us to get some much-needed air, but his fear of torturing the audience into an irritable state gets the best of him.Not a stretch here to say that Conroy lands as probably the best performance of Reynolds' career. He makes a few snarky comments here and there lest we forget he's the guy in the box, but as he pleads with voices on the other end to pick up the phone, come save him, or stop being a bleeping idiot, he's most importantly relinquishing control. Reynolds rarely plays characters who don't dominate the scene or desire being the center of attention. Amusing because Paul Conroy is that kind of character exactly, just in a more literal way. As such, kudos to Reynolds for not completely milking that attention for egotistical purposes. We could have done with half as many outbursts and phone calls that end in hyperventilation (seriously, how much air is in that box?), but never once do we dispose of our sympathy for Paul and his situation.That's key, because ""Buried"" excites 'til the very end. Rarely does a film build up as much doubt about the ending and legitimate confusion about whether or not Paul will suffocate or be saved. While the social commentary plays into that answer and costs ""Buried"" some points in terms of being a terrific thriller, Cortes has created an incomparable ride that had so much potential to go wrong but swerves artfully around most of it.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Buried
41,jzappa,"Yep, That's Everything.",8,6 May 2011,"Paul Conroy awakens in blackness. He reaches, touches, understands. He finds a lighter. In its small, finite blaze, his worst suspicions are made real. He finds his cell phone. He discovers he has been abducted and is a captive, in a coffin underground.Already we're relating to Conroy's frantic thoughts. Who can he call who can free him before the oxygen in the coffin comes to an end? Mercifully the coffin is longer than normal, affording it more air and also particular camera angles that develop the action. And there is action. Even if the whole movie is set in the enclosed plot, director Rodrigo Cortes and writer Chris Sparling are inspired in creating more credible action than one would imagine achievable. They also permit themselves some POV shots from beyond the coffin, not above ground, but just from indeterminate darkness above the rectangular prison.Paul uses the phone. These calls are drills in aggravation. There is nothing totally like being put on hold while you're buried alive. It's the filmmakers' astute choice to exclude any shots of the action at the other end of the calls. No flashbacks to the attack and abduction itself. No crying wife. The movie exemplifies the power of sound design and radio drama: The imagery we muster in our heads is more forceful than any made real. A distinguished image gives fulfillment. An imagined one arouses craving. With Paul, we're longing to convey ourselves to the other end of every call.None of the events are unfeasible. The real and the fantastic share no space here. There is merely the direct scenario. Ryan Reynolds has more restricted space than usual to work in, obviously, and physicality essentially predetermined by the coffin, but he makes the character persuasive if unavoidably incomplete. The use of 2:35 wide screen, in spite of what you would think, augments the impression of claustrophobia. I would not enjoy one second of being buried alive.",Buried
42,videorama-759-859391,A claustrophobic nightmare,8,9 May 2014,"You may think a whole film about someone buried alive in a coffin, spells BORING. When you watch this, trust me, you'll be sorely mistaken. That's how I saw the movie, after reading the whole script. Ryan Reynolds, believably fantastic here, as the damsel in distress, the king of helplessness, an expendable victim, by many a party, who awakens, in a box with only very few belongings, plus a stranger's cell phone. Over the next 90 minutes, we share his anger, fury, helplessness, and sorely want to get out of this containment. What I like about Buried is it's back story. Reynolds has been put there as a ransom, where if he doesn't film himself, beaten up, and making a faux confession to the government to infiltrate a big fee, he'll never be found, even though we know he never would if the ransom went ahead. What makes Buried work is the situation of Reynolds, if any of us, put in the same situation, if only equipped with a few supplies, these are the things we would do, which overrides the boredom of the movie. One hairy close call, has him ridding himself of a large python that gets in the box. One scene that angered me, was with Reynolds, exchanging dialogue, with the unmistakable and annoying voice of Toblowsky, one party who has chosen to let poor young Ryan die. With not the so nicest of endings, what we have here is an underground masterpiece, that works, not just because of Reynolds, who as an actor, really puts himself up to the challenge, but because, there's always something happening. Even watching it on my computer I felt a little claustrophobic, which god knows what would of happen to Paul (Reynolds) if he was asthmatic. Fantastically filmed hit, disturbing I guess to the asthmatic population if viewing it.",Buried
43,gwnightscream,Just As The Title Says,5,11 April 2020,"Ryan Reynolds stars in this 2010 thriller as a truck driver, Paul Conroy who finds himself in a claustrophobic nightmare in Iraq where he becomes trapped inside a wooden coffin and fights to stay alive with only a low-battery, cell phone and lighter at his side. This starts ok, but could've been better in my opinion. My only gripe is that they could've shown the events prior to Paul being in the coffin. Reynolds is great as usual and you can feel the tension and despair that his character faces. If you're into psychological thrillers, give this a try, but it's just as the title says.",Buried
44,BeneCumb,Big things can happen in a small place...,7,10 July 2012,"It is a real solo movie, skilfully directed (Rodrigo Cortés) and played (Ryan Reynolds). Tensions are high, the plot is sophisticated and with twists. The hero's (Paul Conroy) hope is maintained throughout the movie - in spite of different messages given over the phone, resulting with temporary mood twists. It would be also interesting to see this in a dramatized way, although, for real enjoyment, the end could remain a surprise. And last but not least: puts-on-hold, pagers, answering machines, switches, and weak batteries are not only annoying, but can have lethal consequences. And not just in so extreme situations, but e.g. during minor accidents, health disorders, witnessing crime etc.",Buried
45,dfranzen70,"Fantastic, and tough to look away",9,26 September 2010,"Buried, a thriller about a man buried in a wooden coffin somewhere in the Iraqi desert, is certainly difficult to watch for anyone who has issues with confined spaces but is also utterly engrossing and terrifying. And Ryan Reynolds, as the American citizen-contractor who finds himself in his sandy predicament, is galvanizing in a role that requires a heck of a lot of pure acting skills - no playing off other characters and no leaning on elaborate sets.Paul Conroy (Reynolds) awakes inside a pine box. After a few - of many - panicky moments, Paul discovers two weapons in his arsenal: a Zippo lighter and a cell phone (not his). Naturally, he makes several calls, but most of them wind up going to voice mail or, in multiple cases, clueless drones who don't really believe his situation.Making a movie like this is probably no picnic for anyone involved, least of all Reynolds, stunt double or not. Even if the coffin in which he's encased were completely open on the top, with camera trickery cleverly belieing its volume, he's still scrunched in an awkward, terribly uncomfortable position for the bulk of the film.It's easy to appreciate movies in which the director has so little to work with. Reynolds is the only person we seen on screen, although his character communicates with functionaries and loved ones via the cell phone. The coffin itself is (mostly) empty. There are sound effects, but no CGI. It is a paragon of minimalist filmmaking.What makes this movie work above all else is the abject terror it instills in you. When Conroy's flame goes out and he begins scraping about in the darkness, you feel as if the walls of the theater are closing in around you. His breathing becomes your breathing, and your heart beats with his. Every bead of sweat and drop of Paul Conroy's blood is viewed close-up and personal. And, as with some of the best films, you feel you are watching reality unfold, rather than a staged morality play.Reynolds is really terrific. He's been saddled with high-flying superhero movies, like the Blade and X-Men films, and stupid chick flicks, like The Proposal. Turns out he's excellent when given a really challenging role. Because of his efforts and those of the screenwriter (Chris Sparling), Buried is excruciating and effective, playing with its audiences' emotions with simple measures of stark reality. To be sure, this is no maudlin melodrama about man's slow demise, and neither is it an overboard look at US activities in Iraq. It is merely what it pretends to be: a movie about a man caught in a trap not of his own device. Nothing that happens to Paul in this movie seems implausible. Nothing seems contrived simply to move the plot along. Sparling doesn't need to stoop to such nonsense, because being trapped in a box underground is horrifying enough for anyone. Even when, at one point, an X factor is introduced, an explanation for its arrival is quickly at hand - and it, too, makes perfect sense.Buried is a tough movie to watch at times, but it's so impeccably directed, written, and acted that it's well worth the discomfort. It's exciting, and best of all, the conclusion is in doubt right up to the very last seconds. Certainly recommended to fans of thrillers, particularly of the psychological nature.",Buried

47,meeza,"""Buried"" is strongly grounded!",8,3 March 2011,"I am not going to dig too deep into the plot of Director Rodrigo Cortes' claustrophobic thriller ""Buried"". Why? Because there is not much of a plot in ""Buried"" due to its enclosed nature. Ryan Reynolds is the sole visual actor in ""Buried"". He plays Paul Conroy, a U.S. contractor working in Iraq as a truck driver. Conroy gets captured by Iraqi insurgents and is buried alive in a coffin. His only company is a pencil and a cell phone that becomes Paul's best & worst service provider. The cell phone is not his; it was planted there by his capturers, who must have signed up for the deluxe plan because that cell phone takes a licking and keeps on ticking or ringing that is. ""Buried"" centrally revolves around Reynolds' performance which was quite vivid; you could say he acted ""outside the box"" for what was expected of his character, or maybe he didn't. Confused? Maybe you are, but Chris Sparling's sparkling & clever screenplay will not confuse; he even incorporates fiery comedic points into the most brutal of situations in ""Buried"". Obviously, Conroy does not have a convoy of life characters to have dialogue with, so most of the screenplay is from his cell phone conversations to ""call for help"". Even though its set in an unconventional setting and not in battle warfare, Cortes does not cut himself too much in delivering some stout antiwar messages and also fires sarcastic hits on hypocritical US diplomacy. ""Buried"" is not a classic masterpiece and not recommended for the claustrophobic clan, but it is engaging and thrilling enough to not bury you with boredom. **** Good",Buried
48,estebangonzalez10,Ryan Reynolds vs James Franco. Who can survive in the smallest spaces,7,15 April 2011,"¨I need one million dollars by nine o'clock tonight or I'll be left to die in this coffin! ¨I can imagine several producers and directors having read Chris Sparling's suspenseful screenplay and thought to themselves this is a great premise, but it can't be done in film. Why? Because it takes place entirely inside a coffin. How can you make a film in such a confined space and maintain the viewer interested? It could make for a great novel, but not a film. Making this picture would imply huge risks and Hollywood isn't really interested in taking these risks at the moment. However a relatively unknown Spanish director, Rodrigo Cortés, who had been heavily influenced and inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's minimalist films like The Rope and Lifeboat, thought it could be done because the screenplay was inventive and strong enough. He knew that by playing around with the camera angles and lighting he could maintain the viewer's interest. Of course all that wouldn't matter if he didn't get a great actor who would be able to pull it off. The casting of the film would play a huge part in the success of the movie and since the film takes place entirely in a wooden box the production cost wouldn't be so high so they could hire an A-list Hollywood actor. They found that actor in Ryan Reynolds who gives one of the best performances of his career. Everything was set and the camera began rolling entirely in a studio in Barcelona, far from Hollywood. The movie begins pitch black while we hear some heavy breathing. Suddenly a Zippo is lit and we see a man bound and gagged inside a wooden coffin. He manages to untie himself and finds a cell phone lying next to him. His first move is to call his wife Linda (voiced by Samantha Mathis), but no one answers so he leaves a message on her recorder. Next he calls 911 and explains the situation to the operator. His name is Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) and he is buried inside a coffin somewhere in the middle of the dessert in Iraq. He doesn't remember how he ended up in the coffin. He claims to be an American contractor in Iraq working as a truck driver for CRT. All he remembers is that his convoy was attacked by a group of insurgents and the rest of the truck drivers were all shot to death, he later blacked out and woke up in coffin. Why did his captures bury him alive and leave a cell phone with him? The answer comes next when Paul receives a call from a terrorist named Jabir (voiced by Jose Luis García Perez). He demands 5 million dollars by 9 PM or else they will let him die inside the coffin. Paul then has to contact the FBI in order to find help and see if they can trace the call. They transfer him to one of their hostage negotiators in Iraq, Dan Brenner (voiced by Robert Patterson), who begins to work on his case and race against time in order to save his life. They know they don't have a lot of time because the oxygen in the coffin is scarce so they have to move quickly. The entire story takes place inside the coffin so we have to begin to piece together what is going on as he makes the different calls. I am glad this movie takes place entirely inside the coffin and that Rodrigo Cortés had no need to rely on flashbacks to tell the story. He could have easily shown us flashbacks of what happened with Paul when he was attacked, but shooting the movie inside a wooden box gives this movie a more claustrophobic and suspenseful feeling to it. Watching Ryan Reynolds perform inside such a close space makes me think how much luckier James Franco was in 127 Hours. Franco had more space to move and besides that movie doesn't take place entirely inside the cave and has several flashbacks. I'm not saying Buried is a better movie, it just makes it completely different from the ones we are used to seeing. It's a minimalist film at its purest form reminiscing some of Hitchcock's greatest films (which Cortés actually intended). Reynolds is great in this movie and deserved a lot more recognition than he received, although Franco probably made his performance forgettable in Award Season with 127 Hours. The screenplay should have also received a lot more love for its originality and being able to maintain the suspense and thrills inside a small wooden box. Buried does begin a bit slow since it has to repeat itself over and over again when Paul has to explain what has happened to him first to the 911 operator, then to the FBI agents, and then to his negotiator, but the suspense slowly began to build maintaining my interest up to the very end which ends in a high climactic note. The film is definitely worth checking out although I wouldn't sit through it for a second time.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Buried

50,jimbo-53-186511,"One location, one actor = an excellent low budget claustrophobic thriller",7,13 July 2014,"Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is an American truck driver working for a company called CRT whilst out in Iraq. He wakes up to find himself buried in a coffin somewhere in the Iraqi desert. Whoever placed him in the coffin has left him with a cell phone, a lighter, a pencil and a glow stick. Paul soon learns that he has been kidnapped and is being held to ransom. The kidnapper informs Paul that he has till 9pm to get him $5 million dollars otherwise he will be left there to die. With only limited resources at his disposal, Paul does everything he can to make sure that he gets found whilst trying to survive with limited time and limited oxygen.Buried is a film that takes a really simple concept and manages to turn it into a effective and edgy thriller. The entire 95 minute duration is spent with Conroy stuck in the coffin and the only other contributions come from those that Conroy speaks to on the phone. Reynolds is the only 'screen' actor in this film and therefore the effect of the entire film rests on how convincing his performance is. Thankfully, Reynolds was excellent and manages to switch between anger, upset, and despair with ease. Cortes' direction was also sharp - the very fact that Conroy was trapped in a box already gives the film a claustrophobic feel, but Cortes adds to this feel by giving us lots of dark shots and plenty of close ups of Reynolds which makes the film even more claustrophobic. Cortes is helped in these scenes by Reynolds convincing delivery.Whilst this is a premise that will be nigh on impossible for anyone to relate to, it is one that makes you throw up the 'What if' scenario? What if that were me? Who would I call? What would I do? You could perhaps take it one stage further and say How would I do things differently? The answer to the last question is subjective and will really depend on the individual. I personally think that Conroy did almost everything correct - he had to use his battery life wisely on his phone by making the right calls to the right people, he would only use his lighter when he needed to write things down and read out numbers and also uses it when an uninvited guest arrives in his coffin. I think given the circumstances I would have probably done the same things, although in hindsight wasting battery life on his phone by leaving several messages for his wife seemed a bit silly, but then again these phone calls will have been motivated by blind panic and fear rather than rational thought.Buried is a great little film that manages to be reasonably exciting and tense and much of this is down to Cortes' solid direction and Reynolds excellent performance.

I'll be honest, I didn't like this movie very much while I was watching it. Maybe it was the claustrophobia inducing subject matter but I thought it was a bit much (ambitious) to look at a man in a box, talking on a cell phone for an hour and 35 minutes. However now, in retrospect (& probably because of the ending) I just can't stop thinking about this movie. -I did not expect that outcome.

55,aharmas,Deep in Hell,9,26 December 2010,"Ryan Reynolds is a fantastic actor. I'm glad I saw this after ""127"", a film that is a bit overrated but has a very good performance by Franco (much better in ""Howl""); Reynolds completely blows him out of the water with his intense and emotional turn as the man who discovers you don't need to die to go to hell.Reynolds is a driver who finds himself buried alive and the victim of one of life's sickest jokes as he tries to get himself freed from his tomb. Little by little he learns that very few people treasure life in general, or sadly, his own. At first, the sense of claustrophobia is so intense, we doubt if we can sit and endure 90 minutes of this type of torture. However, as the story unfolds, and with the assistance of some creative writing, we get to live through the horrible experiences he endures while trying to save himself.With the help of some selective equipment, among them a cellphone, which becomes intermittently a symbol of hope and despair as his efforts leading a series of incidents that remind him of what is best and worst in life. He tries to contact his relatives, his government, his torturers, and in what becomes a hell of an experience for him and the audience, the filmmakers keep leaving us breathless.Much of this film succeeds because Reynolds gives a sensational performance, one that has probably not been seen by many, or he would be getting some much deserve recognition. It's heartbreaking to see him undergo attacks of anxiety, anger, and frustration as he talks to different members of his family and some horrible encounters with the worst of bureaucracy. If you think the entire physical experience of being trapped in a wooden box, in the darkness is hellish, just wait until you mix this environment with the voice of a corporate attorney. I almost threw up during those ten minutes.The film was produced and put together by a group of very talented Spanish talent. Hollywood heed the call and don't remake the good movies.

56,Jonny_Numb,"Strong, Subjective Horror",7,14 March 2011,"When done well, a film whose main gimmick rests on the widespread fear of enclosed spaces can inspire a flood of queasiness and horror greater than most genre films (and indeed, something few can match). With few aesthetic exceptions, ""Buried"" is exactly what the title promises -- the tale of U.S. civilian contractor Paul Conroy (a fantastically believable Ryan Reynolds), who awakens in darkness, only to discover that he's been buried alive by terrorists bent on getting a ransom for his oxygen-deprived body. With only a cell phone, a pen, and a small canteen of liquor, director Rodrigo Cortes manages to ratchet up tension as well as (if not better than) a big-budget suspense thriller utilizing a wide variety of locales. For 95 grueling minutes, Paul frantically tries to make contact with the State Department, his company's CEO, and his absent wife in the States, only to be met with a string of double-talk, false assurances, and threats of extreme punishment (the terrorist he communicates with chillingly demands for him to make a ransom video for the public). With the exception of some brief video communicated via cell phone, Cortes never leaves the coffin, and the effect is harrowing; much like Conroy, we feel the urgency of the situation and the sense that time may be running out. While its closing twist is somewhat predictable (given the course of events, I feel that most viewers will see it coming), ""Buried"" is still an exhaustively well-done exercise in confined, subjective horror.",Buried

In may ways this film is a big indictment of the corporate western world. Despite fighting for his life and explaining his circumstances to people who he calls on his mobile he is still put through to answering machines , people who feed him bullshit and worst of all his company who are more interested in not being sued than saving this mans life.Yet because he has a Blackberry he can almost do anything ....Almost.Reynold is superb in every way.

Ryan Reynolds steps out of his cocky smart-assed comedic shadow in an incredible one man show. Everything rests on his shoulders as he conveys the fear, frustration, sorrow, regret, hope etc. of a man buried alive. An actor must have incredible confidence to be the main subject for 90 minutes. Reynolds manages to achieve this without turning it into an ego trip. It sounds funny, but considering the lack of space to work in, the camera work is flawless. Director Cortes explores this box like some brand new fantasy world. As the film progresses it unravels as a social/political statement, which, though heavy handed, has invested enough in a believable and likable main character. Sometimes it pushes itself too far and forgets its focus, such as the snake/fire scene.

Also I noticed some criticism towards capitalism and the selfishness involving CRT and the phone girls, like saying everything happens for money and that's all we think about.

This movie is just a guy lying in a coffin for 90 minutes, but it doesn't feel that way at all. It's filled with all kinds of plot, yet without ever leaving it's creepily confined location. The ending is also excellent, really fitting. Brilliant movie.",Buried
62,pc95,Claustrophobic Gimmick,4,29 May 2011,"Sometimes a movie comes around that seems like a novel idea, and has some originality - that can be said for the movie ""Buried"", a film directed by Rodrigo Cortes starring Ryan Reynolds. While indeed this movie is novel for about 10 min and original in it's scope, it is little more than a gimmick. Movies such as this one make it off the ground because they're referred to as high-concept. Unfortunately, this one is not high-concept but a cheap parlor trick. With only Ryan Reynolds physically in the movie, Buried is a test of patience and while it achieves a feeling of claustrophobia, it does little else. We are subjected to Reynolds yelling, struggling, swearing and the like for what seems little reason. The ending doesn't really matter - either way it's a poorly thought out movie based out of novelty that has little going for it.

63,lewiskendell,The Lonely Grave of Paul Conroy,7,19 January 2011,"Any Kill Bill fan will probably tell you that the coffin scene from Volume 2 is one of the best and most memorable scenes in the movies. There's something innately terrifying and exciting about the idea of being trapped in a small, virtually airtight space, especially underground. Buried is like a feature length version of that scene, except unlike the heroine in Kill Bill, the captive person doesn't have any hope of getting out of his confinement on his own. What Paul (Ryan Reynolds) does have is a flashlight, a knife, a lighter, a cell phone (with a dwindling battery, of course), and a few other items. He's a contracted truck driver in Iraq, whose convoy was attacked. Paul wakes up in the dark coffin at the very beginning of the movie, and his only contact with the outside world throughout the duration is through the cell phone that was left with him by the people who kidnapped him. Most of the plot revolves around the phone. Paul's captives use it to threaten him and force him to do what they want, he uses it to try to contact help and his family, and he's constantly staring balefully at the depleting battery bar (dude, ever heard of dimming the brightness?).Reynolds does a good job in what is essentially a one-man show. He gets put through the range of emotions, even though terror is (understandably) his primary state. The pacing is initially slow, but there are various events that happen both inside and outside the coffin, that keep things interesting and dangerous. I felt that Buried got stronger as it went along, and the ending was absolutely excellent. This is still a ""gimmick"" movie at heart, but the writing and direction are good enough that Buried is worth watching for more than just the novelty of the premise. Check it out.",Buried

Buried with only a cell phone and a lighter, his contact with the outside world and ability to piece together clues that could help him discover his location are maddeningly limited. Poor reception, a rapidly draining battery, and a dwindling oxygen supply become his worst enemies in a tightly confined race against time, fighting panic, despair and delirium, Paul has only ninety minutes to be rescued before his worst nightmare comes true. (Lionsgate)BURIED is a suspenseful film that succeeds in putting you at the edge of your seats. In other words, it does its job. For those of you who are wondering if it's possible to make a good and interesting film that takes place entirely in a coffin with one on screen character, yes, it is possible. There's just so much you can do in a coffin, but screenwriter Chris Sparling found some pretty creative things to put into the film.Usually in a film with one character, the actor who plays that character should be up to the task to carry the film on his or her shoulders. Fortunately, Ryan Reynolds succeeds in doing so. I love how Reynolds is doing more serious roles to show off his talent and it shows here. I really felt like rooting for his character. I would also like to give a shout out to the editing and cinematography departments because of how inventive they tried to tell the story in an interactive way. The soundtrack by Victor Reyes also brings up the film.It's not the best thriller ever, but if a film that takes place entirely in a coffin with one character succeeds in engrossing the audience, you know the film is good. It's claustrophobic and tense and benefits mainly from Chris Sparling's creative screenplay and Ryan Reynolds's acting chops; in other words, the two most important things to any film.",Buried

The story of the movie seems realist and believable Kudos to director ""Rodrigo Cortes"" for that! Buried is not a usual trap movie like Saw or Hostel, where we see people trapped and get tortured. Here the torture is that knowledge of being buried in the desert where a person can suffocate any second plus the people (US Govt.) Who can help you out are not Trustworthy. The whole story is very intriguingly unfolds to us and it shows the brutal face of US govt. & Big Corporation running operations in Iraq. There was one major flaw in the movie which was that ""it becomes unbelievable that Ryan could get to his wife or his wife doesn't call him until the very last scene. The kidnapper tells Ryan that his trapped video got 45 thousand hits on youtube and its running all over the T.V channel, I just couldn't get how come his Wife doesn't get the news faster because logically hundreds of his friends and family members saw him on TV why no one call his wife? It seems little unbelievable but Nonetheless it's an interesting movie. No one can thought that Ryan Reynolds can be the Guy in the Box for entire 95minutes because it required solid acting chops, Ryan Reynolds is good but mostly comes off cocky in movies except ""The Amittyville Horror & The Proposal"". In ""Buried"" Ryan Reynolds proved me wrong & showed why Hollywood love him so much because he has incredible acting chops if the material is provided. Ryan Reynolds work is exceptional and there are no two words about that, I think it's his finest work till date. He makes the movie so thrilling and powerful that in the end it actually leaves you kind of Speechless. Overall I loved the movie and it needs a good time & mode to enjoy. Catch it! Ryan Reynolds is totally worth it!",Buried
68,sme_no_densetsu,An interesting concept but not completely successful,7,29 May 2011,"""Buried"" is unusual in that it takes place entirely within the confines of a coffin. Ryan Reynolds plays a truck driver in Iraq who's been kidnapped by unknown individuals and buried alive. With only a cell phone at his disposal he is tasked with arranging for his kidnappers' ransom demands to be met before he suffocates.The premise is an intriguing one but, even at 95 minutes, the story is stretched a little thin. This would have been ideally suited for a half-hour or one hour TV show. Instead, the visual possibilities are exhausted early on and the script gets sidetracked with needless diversions.The movie is basically a one man show for Ryan Reynolds. Simply put, Reynolds is not an actor capable of carrying a movie like this. He does a passable job, I suppose, but he's not someone whose performance I'd want to watch for 95 minutes (or, for that matter, 5 minutes) straight. Apart from him there are a handful of others that lend their voices only, with acceptable results.I have to give Rodrigo Cortés credit for tackling a picture like this but the fact is that there's only so much you can do when you're shooting inside a coffin. A better score could probably have helped as well but that's a relatively minor point.I watched this right after ""127 Hours"", which is another movie about someone being stuck in one place while struggling for survival, and I'd definitely have to say that Boyle's film is head and shoulders above this offering. ""Buried"" is a decent enough movie in the end but I'm mainly rating it a 7 for audacity rather than content.",Buried

70,Troy_Campbell,Kudos to Cortes for attempting something different.,7,16 October 2010,"If your initial reaction to hearing that Buried is set solely in a coffin – there's no flashbacks, no dream sequences, nothing except what happens inside that box – is that a whole film can't sustain the thrills and chills with such limited setting, well, you're wrong. Once the Hitchcock-esquire credit sequence has drawn to a close, the inventive screenplay by Chris Sparling, dedicated acting by Ryan Reynolds and impressive direction from Rodrigo Cortes combine to ensure Buried remains gripping to the very end.Cortes grinds away at your nerves with an ingenious array of lighting techniques, sound design and camera tricks. The flickering orange glare of the zippo lighter is enough to see everything at the forefront, but cunningly generates ominous shadows in the process. A minor creak in the woodwork emphasises the frailty of Paul's situation to devastating effect; the earth packed above could cause the coffin lid to cave in at any moment and every creak could be the last. Inspired tracking shots demonstrate how isolated Paul is from the rest of the world whilst accentuating his claustrophobic situation.With the whole film having a budget of only $3m – far less than Reynolds' usual salary alone – the Canadian actor must have been blown away by the script when deciding to accept the job. He throws himself into the role with admirable gusto, creating a character we want to go on this roller-coaster ride with. Granted, he can't do much physically other than what the narrative demands, however by injecting a bit of nervous humour here and there and allowing his emotions to run their natural course, Reynolds instils Paul with a genuineness that makes it extremely easy to relate with.Kudos to Cortes for attempting something different and to Reynolds for seeing the potential.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Buried
71,leftbanker-1,A Film School Short Gone Horribly Wrong,4,26 September 2016,"¡This review is nothing but spoilers!Since there is nothing to see in this film besides the inside of a wooden box this concept would have worked a lot better as a radio drama. This was like a film school project gone horribly wrong. It could have worked as a short, a very, very short short. From the very beginning the panic and clouded thinking of the protagonist and the stupidity of the folks on the other end of the line was just completely irritating. Examples:A guy asks him for his Social Security number and he explodes in anger. Sort of a reasonable request by any standards. People on the other end keep asking really stupid questions.He constantly freaks out and throws little bitch tantrums which add nothing cinematically, they are just annoying.Listening to phones ringing, dial tones, answering machine messages, and operators blathering is not fun, not for me. The same goes for people reading phone numbers. Maybe because I hate phones so much but this movie just irritated me.Him groping around in the coffin trying to do stuff is not very compelling viewing, not in my opinion. It's just pure tedium.He just can't seem to ask people for what he wants but how freaking hard would it be for him to just say this, ""I have been kidnapped and I am going to die soon unless someone helps me.The good news is that I am writing this as I ""watch"" the movie because I'm just listening on my headphones....and then he talks to someone who actually seems like he knows what the hell he is talking about and is serious about helping him. The plot thickens...but then very quickly this brief spark of life in the film is extinguished and he spends a couple of minutes grunting around trying to retrieve a note at his feet...yawn...cough, cough...can't breathe...don't know if I can make it...battery on computer almost finished...only minutes left...movie not keeping my interest...cough, wish that I had pills and booze like he does in the movie to get me through this...just remembered, I do have booze...be right back...OK, I'm better but the movie is getting worse by the minute...I wish I had pills...the screen was black for a long time...is this movie over?...please, God, let it be over...for the love of Allah, it's not over...snake in coffin...almost as stupid as a shark in the coffin...and then the movie starts to get REALLY stupid...can't make it to the end of the film...tell someone that I love them, anyone, I don't care.",Buried
72,antoniotierno,clever and original 90 min movie,7,21 October 2010,"Buried is certainly an excellent movie, not only thanks to Ryan Reynolds but also and especially because of Rodrigo Cortes's direction. The whole story takes place in a box, a wooden coffin to be exact, where we see Ryan crying, the only thing he can do on the other hand.. Cortes uses his camera to bring Paul's tomb to life, as well as to make the space seem bigger or smaller (depending on the right moments), in addition to playing with the various kinds of light coming out of Paul's devices. You get to feel every moment of his desperation, frustration and disappointment for the bureaucracy (not unhappy to let die there). Buried has a sad finale, maybe chosen more to be very (terribly) realistic. The movie's final moments probably had many people in the audience - in every movie theater in the world - broken down in tears, with appropriate closing music. Overall a very good flick.",Buried

The film's hook is that it takes place entirely within the coffin and he can only use a lighter and cell phone to try and find a way out. Instead he chose to use the lighter and scream to use up all his oxygen. And then the film plays out like every other thriller where he has to get money to the bad guys before time runs out.""Buried"" looks and sounds like ""The Blair Witch Project"" stuck in a box. The flickering light and his constant screaming wears on nerves faster than his stupidity. A lot of time was wasted in establishing how stuck he was and not enough time was spent in creating interesting or appealing character traits.It's quite possible that a lot of people would become grating and annoying when they're buried alive, but that doesn't add any sense of realism to the film and just hurts its likability. Based-on-true-story films have proved that there are real life people trapped in death-defying situations who use resourcefulness and thoughtfulness to survive. Those are the types of films that can grab you emotionally and keep you hooked. ""Buried"" is just not one of them.",Buried
74,blott2319-1,"Tense and claustrophobic, but lacking in story",6,23 September 2021,"Buried is a great concept for a film. Not only is it cheap to make because it's all basically one scene with just one actor in one location, but it also puts the audience mentally in the situation with the protagonist immediately. I will say that I was a bit surprised how fast the claustrophobia wore off for me. I still felt the desperation of his situation, but for some reason I felt less stress than I expected (I wonder if it might have been different if I watched it in a theater.) However, while I could tolerate the confined space, I don't know if I've ever been more frustrated with things like the endless red tape and series of answering machines that the protagonist calls. It is truly infuriating as no one wants to listen and his situation feels so urgent. But I thought the way that the different men talked to him on the phone was fascinating, and it was neat how you could guess what their real intentions were. The ending wasn't exactly a surprise for me, simply because I could sense he was being lied to early on.I kind of wish Ryan Reynolds' character cared more about the battery life of the phone or the amount of fuel in his lighter. I couldn't help my constant feeling of irritation that he would do more to eat up his battery, and would not stop turning on his lighter (which was most likely just for the viewers' benefit.) The bigger issue I had with Buried was the fact that it got to be a bit repetitive and often felt like they were stretching for time. In a movie that feels like there is no time to waste, it seemed they didn't have enough to do in order to even fill 90 minutes. They'd throw in pointless little setbacks in order to add some action, but that wasn't necessary. I wanted more time getting to know our protagonist and seeing how he talked with the different people in his life. Buried is still an effective film that will create some extreme thrills for many audience members, but it lacked a little something to completely excite me.",Buried

77,Stampsfightclub,A fantastic thriller worth seeing,8,16 October 2010,"The idea of being trapped in a coffin 12 feet underground is hardly comfortable, and to make a film an hour and a half long inside this coffin, seems like a long shot but it works with a great intensity and the best ever performance by Ryan Reynolds.Word of warning this isn't the best film for people with claustrophobia and people with fears of snakes.The film centres around a captive in the coffin who was placed in the coffin by a group of terrorists needing $5 million to secure his release. Locked in the small wooden box with a Zippo lighter, fluorescent tubes and a blackberry Paul Conroy must ring around for help.The opening is just a black screen with heavy panicked breathing, perfectly setting the tone for the film and the lurid bashing and realisation of his predicament cement the horrible notion that there is no quick escape.It is quite amazing how a simple terrorist plot can be so gripping and in this case quite controversial. There are many immigrant issues, political propaganda and the placement in Iraq adds to the drama of the plot.Throw in a sub family plot and come the last half an hour the drama has been notched up. There is a strong horrible video sent to the blackberry of a terrorist shooting that gave an echoed gasp from everyone in the cinema around me.What was startling was the last ten minutes. The way the mood changed from hopeful, to optimistic to pessimistic to hopeful and so far. How can a one man show and one way plot shake up so many emotions from one place?

78,KnightsofNi11,A triumph in minimalist filmmaking,9,26 January 2011,"I hate it when fantastic movies such as this get completely overlooked when it comes time for awards to be handed out. Buried is a triumph in minimalist filmmaking and is a heart wrenchingly intense movie experience. It is gripping, moving, frustrating, and terrifying. Oh yeah, and it all takes place inside a box. Paul Conroy, who is played by Ryan Reynolds and is the only character in the movie we actually see, wakes up in a coffin buried under the ground with no idea how he got there or who put him there. He shortly finds out that he is being held by ransom by a group of terrorists in Iraq. With only a pen, a flask, a cell phone, and only 90 minutes of oxygen, Paul has to act fast. The movie limits itself to an astounding extent, but makes the most out of what it has, creating an incredibly thrilling experience.How much can you really expect from a movie that takes place in a human sized box with only one person? Buried delivers a lot more than you would expect from this scenario. It has all the right elements to make it as enthralling as any action film we see today. To start off, Rodrigo Cortes does a great job directing his limited space. He miraculously pulls off a lot of great shots and brilliant claustrophobic nuances. He directs with enough skill to keep the movie interesting in its entirety. The movie never felt lagged or drawn out and every moment where it would have slowed down it would throw a great twist or shocking moment that drew you right back in.Furthermore, the director does a lot of great artistic work with what little he to work with. We have to take into consideration the fact that when you are buried underground in a coffin, there is obviously zero light. Thankfully Paul has various light sources with him in the coffin. And so to keep from breaking the realism of the film, these light sources are the only light in the film, making sure all light is authentic. Paul's light sources include a lighter, a flashlight, a cell phone, and a green glow stick. Each of these light sources gives off a different color, and these colors which obviously encompass everything when they are present add to and reflect the mood of the film. When things are calmer (relatively of course) we are treated to the soft blue light of the cell phone. As things grow more suspenseful and harrowing we are treated to scenes lit by the green glow stick. And when things grow more sinister the red lens of the flashlight is used. I found these minute details fascinating and they artistically added a lot to a film which had little room to work with.While Cortes' directing gives the film plenty of life, Ryan Reynold's stalwart performance really drives the emotion of the film. He delivers a top notch performance, and he as to seeing as he is the only character in the film other than the various people he talks to on the phone which we never actually see. It can't be easy to carry a film all by yourself, but this year we were treated to two performances that did a superb job at it, the other of course being James Franco in 127 Hours.Buried is a film that Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of. It is a groundbreaking thriller that does so much with so little. It is such a harrowing movie experience that you cannot forget. All 90 minutes of this film are fascinating and gripping, especially the last fifteen. The final moments of the film are some of the most captivating and enthralling moments I've ever experienced through film. During the finale of the film you will want nothing more than to know the fate of Paul Conroy, and when you finally do learn his fate at the close of the film your jaw will drop and you will be utterly blown away by such a captivating on screen experience.",Buried

The precept is intriguing and many aspects are done extremely well. There are also some serious flaws, not least the fact that he keeps using the Zippo which is not only using up oxygen but surely getting too hot to touch?However, I did enjoy Reynolds' performance and I think Cortes does a very good job creating this much suspense inside a wooden box. I also liked the fact that there were no flashback scenes or glimpses of the real world and that the ending played out the way it did. Overall, while it may not be a masterpiece, I think there is far more good than bad and Cortes deserves praise for his ingenuity and writing.",Buried
80,ajs-10,A very innovative and daring thriller.,8,10 October 2010,"I first became aware of this film when it played at the Sundance festival. It was flagged by the critics as one of the standout films of that event. Since then I have been intrigued to see what all the fuss was about. I wasn't disappointed; it is a very innovative and daring film with a great performance from Ryan Reynolds. But more of my thoughts later, first, here's a very short synopsis.I must first say that the opening credits are really well done. I love the, almost, sixties vibe, it made me feel like I was just about to watch an old Hitchcock movie. We open with darkness and breathing as Paul Conroy wakes up to find himself in a box. He fumbles around and finds a Zippo lighter. He lights it and the audience gets the first glimpse of the claustrophobic environment in which he is trapped. He is a truck driver working for a company delivering medical supplies in Iraq in 2005 whose convoy was ambushed by insurgents. Finding a mobile phone (or cell phone for my American friends) he makes a series of phone calls in an attempt to find someone who can help him. He tries to contact his wife, his mother, the FBI, the State Department and his employer, amongst others. Eventually he is put in contact with Dan Brenner who is part of a team set up to help find kidnap victims. He is also contacted by his kidnappers who make demands, threaten his family and generally add to the tension of what is a desperate situation for Paul. Will he be found in time? Is there a way out of this seemingly impossible situation? Well, as you've probably guessed, I'm not going to tell you. I'm sure you wouldn't thank me if I did.The entire film is set inside the box, or coffin, as it is referred to in the dialogue. This makes for a very claustrophobic experience so I definitely wouldn't recommend this film for those who are uncomfortable in enclosed spaces. It does have a very dramatic effect on the audience though, you are slowly drawn into the events on screen and there is no escape. I found it a very enthralling film and one that will stay in my memory for some time to come. As I said at the beginning, it is a really great performance from Ryan Reynolds; he takes us through a whole range of emotions, and does it very well! I should also give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; José Luis García Pérez as Jabir, Robert Paterson as Dan Brenner, Stephen Tobolowsky as Alan Davenport and Samantha Mathis as Linda Conroy.When I saw this film there were not very many people in the theatre but I could tell all of them were enthralled by it. The teenage daughter of a family to my right was clearly moved by the events on screen. Over all, I found it a very innovative and thought-provoking film with a great performance from Ryan Reynolds, who has gone up in my estimation. Also great direction from Rodrigo Cortés who kept the audience gripped throughout. So, for those who don't suffer too badly from claustrophobia, very much recommended, otherwise, I'd probably steer clear.My score: 7.9/10",Buried
81,witster18,"Confined in space, and confined in terms of it's target audience, but solid!",6,25 January 2011,"I've always been a fan of Ryan Reynolds.He has proved to be quite versatile of late, and this film highlights that versatility because it completely depends on his ability as an actor to sell this movie.Buried is about a truck driver working in Irag for a contractor. The film starts with the lead in one serious predicament, and pretty much stays in that box for the duration. We've all seen films confined to a small space, but this film takes that premise to a new level.To make this work you need one heck of a good actor, AND a good director. Thankfully, this movie had both.Buried certainly won't endear itself to the masses. I really don't want to give anything away - so that's really about all I can tell you about why. BUT, if you're a fan of original film, OR a fan of a small group of filmmakers/AND one actor putting their heart and soul into a neat little project; then this is the movie for you.Personally, I would have liked it to end differently, but I'm still fine with the way it ended.Reynolds really immersed himself into this character - even though the character doesn't have the ability to develop much because of his situation. I cannot give enough props to Ryan for a performance that basically makes us care about someone that we know very little about. There are times that the audience wonders if anyone cares about him(within the context of the movie), and that's one of the things I loved about this movie. Before it ends you'll realize that at least someone cares about him. At that moment, all the frustration and pain that he has felt becomes real, and at that moment, this film becomes real.As much as some will pick at the plot - I found that it was very realistic in terms of his interaction with people over the phone: His inability to reach family and friends when needed, the way certain people were determined to help and others were not, the sheer disbelief and ignorance of those to whom he reached out. This movie works, and it's that direction and acting that made it work.68/100As you can see by my score it is no masterpiece, and probably won't garner any significant awards. Buried won't be everyones cup of tea, but hey, I couldn't stand 'Pitch Black' for many of the same reasons people are knocking this film. In reality, acting and direction can save the audience from just about anything:disappointment, being buried in a coffin(well, maybe not that),plot-holes(ex.Frantic), slow-pacing, or feeling like you haven't got your money's worth. Can you watch something with a slow pace, or do you need non-stop action to make you fly away to some far away place where the characteristics of truly meaningful cinema don't apply? Figure that out before you press play.Take this film and 'the American' as two examples of top-20 2010 films that won't appeal to everyone, but are solid films none-the-less. If you're a popcorn flick kinda guy - skip it.",Buried
82,deatman9,I have some problems with this.,5,21 November 2012,I have heard a lot of mixed reviews about this movie apparently everybody seems to either love it or hate it so I decided to give it a watch for myself. This is not the worst movie in the world but it is not without its flaws that for sure. Ryan Reynolds is funny but he could not come close to pulling off this very emotional role. Seeing how it was just him on camera you needed a very solid actor for this role and if they had gotten one it would have probably made the movie incredible.This movie is about a young truck driver who is working in Iraq when some insurgents kidnap him and bury him in a coffin. They give him a lighter and a phone and he makes calls to try to get himself out.A lot of people have problems with this saying its boring and the ending is stupid blah blah blah. But no this movie is not boring its actually thrilling and the ending is not stupid its belieable not your typical Hollywood fairy tale. I just have problems with the acting mainly I didn't care any about the protaginist and the fact that he was lighting a lighter in a small coffin and not suffocating somehow.,Buried
83,killercharm,Should be more popular,9,19 November 2020,"A one man tour-de-force. Rodrigo Cortés directing Ryan Reynolds is a combo made in movie heaven. The writing, too, is strong in this flick. No feints. No jump-scares. Just what one would imagine in his place there in his coffin-like burial chamber. An American civilian gets abducted for ransom in Iraq. He's kept buried in a box until he can come up with cash. He's got his cell with him, and a lighter, and he frantically uses them both.",Buried
84,Likes_Ninjas90,It works as an exercise in claustrophobia because of the convincing performance by Ryan Reynolds,7,28 October 2010,"For all of ninety minutes Buried is set in one location: a wooden coffin buried under the ground somewhere in Iraq. Inside is American truck driver Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) who has been left with a lighter and a cell phone. He tries making calls to his wife to try and get her to contact the embassy to no avail. We learn through is calls that his truck was ambushed by insurgents and that they have left him in this box. He tries ringing his employers and hostage negotiators to try and help find him. With limited battery power he is left at the mercy of these contacts and eventually his kidnappers too, who are demanding millions of dollars for his release. As he begins to run out of air, Paul must balance the demands of the negotiators and his capturers, while trying to maintain his sanity as well. This strangely compelling film is the first feature by director Rodrigo Cortes and it works as an exercise in claustrophobia because of the convincing performance by Ryan Reynolds. In just one location for the entire film his character might not be able to develop but the sense of panic and frustration he expresses is entirely believable. The delivery of his dialogue is purposefully shaky. It feels spontaneous rather than rehearsed and thus more human. It allows the audience to become more involved with him as a character and care more about his fate. Pleasingly, the dialogue also works to reveal tiny snippets of character about Paul too, like how he relates to his mother-in-law and his relations at work as well. It gives a slightly broader picture to Paul's life, convincing us that there is an existing world outside of this one gimmicky location. Though the premise might sound limited, the film is consistently dynamic because Paul can interact with others through his phone. Tension is built not through what Paul does, as he cannot move, but through the failure of others to understand his situation and to act accordingly. It's incredibly effective at developing a feeling of helplessness in a character. This occurs as the box itself begins to physically deteriorate, with sand dripping in and explosions hovering from the outside. With frequently dim lighting and brisk pacing, it becomes highly intense and absorbing to watch. The ending is bound to divide audiences. It's not a particularly likable resolution but it's unconventional and for that more powerful too. Buried is a minor thriller but efficient in every sense.",Buried
85,Darkside-Reviewer,Filler in a box,4,1 May 2021,"Buried (2010) is a rather simple film about a man who wakes up buried in a wooden box somewhere in the Iraqi desert. Ryan Renalds plays Paul Conroy an American truck driver working in Iraq who's convoy is attacked by Iraqi insurgents. Paul wakes up inside a wooden box which is buried somewhere in the Iraqi desert. Paul quickly discovers a cell phone has been left in the box with him by the insurgents who demand a ransom of $5 million dollars. It's now up to Paul to use what little time he has left before the air inside the box runs out to somehow come up with the ransom money. Paul quickly gets to work making calls to the US authorities hoping they will rescue him in time before his air and phone battery eventually run out.The film initially starts out like someone's worst nightmare come true, waking up buried inside what is essentially a wooden coffin. Then after around twenty minutes of watching Ryan Renalds pretending to breath heavily while also shouting on the phone and awkwardly shuffling around inside a wooden box, I realised that this is all the movie was going to be just Ryan Renalds in a box for an hour and twenty minutes.The movie just barely manages to qualify as a feature length film clocking in at just an hour and twenty minutes (That includes both the opening and closing credits and about six different studio logo's). There's a lot of filler in this movie which is painfully boring to watch. There's an awful scene in the movie where a snake enters the wooden box with Renalds character and he has to find a way to fend it off. This was clearly put into the movies script at the last minute as a desperate attempt to add more suspense into the film while also lengthening the movies running time with needless filler.Buried is just another quick time waster that is only worth viewing on a streaming service like Netflix when you have nothing better to watch. I wouldn't recommend paying to own this movie on Blu Ray or 4K-ULTRA HD.",Buried
86,griffolyon12,An In-The-Moment Thriller,8,18 December 2010,"Paul Conroy awakes in a coffin buried under ground with only a cellphone and a Zippo lighter to aid him in his escape in the movie Buried. It's a movie all about the premise, all about the situation, all about the coffin, cause it takes place entirely in that one location. The movie is a checklist of all the things that could take this nightmarish situation and make it worse. A snake gets in the coffin, in one of the more thrilling sequences of the movie. Check! A fire starts in the coffin. Check! Dirt starts flooding in through a hole in the coffin. Check! The movie is a thrill ride that delivers in all of the desired areas. Ryan Reynolds is incredible, showing the range of just about every kind of emotion you'd feel in this situation. Fear. Anxiety. Sorrow. Frustration. Reynolds makes this a one-man show worth watching by just channeling the primal emotions of man, but the emotions can't fully cover up the moments where he is simply lying there in the coffin with nothing to do, and some stronger character development could have helped in that territory; of course, that is for writer Chris Sparling to figure out, and not Reynolds. So it's a fun and intense thrill ride, often at times channeling the work of Hitchcock, largely in part due to the marvelous title sequence and the fantastic musical score by Victor Reyes. But really, it's a face value entertainment only, not much going on beneath the surface save for the commentary on America's policy of dealing with terrorists. So what? This is a movie that is intense and nerve wracking, like it should be.I give Buried an 8 out of 10!",Buried

I hadn't had such an intense viewing experience before, and while I've probably seen more intense movies since, this is still one of the most underrated in my opinion.For the setting alone this movie deserves the title of the most claustrophobic movie of all time. Probably the most impressive thing is that the entire movie is set inside a tiny coffin and yet it never gets tiring or repetitive. Some movies struggle with stories set in a single room, so the fact that this movie pulled it off inside a literal box is absolutely remarkable.",Buried

I just don't get why the spend one and half hours making you like the character just to kill him at the last second. To me that's just Abit pointless. Other then the ending it was surprisingly good. It's surprising how much you can do with just a box. The bit with the snake was slightly terrifying.,Buried
89,Imdbidia,Experimental but thrilling,7,6 May 2011,"Paul Conroy is a married track driver working as a contractor in Iraq. After his convoy is attacked by insurgents, he wakes up inside a coffin, buried alive, with a Zippo, a cell phone, and a little whiskey bottle. He will try to use the two first to get help and be rescued from the outside.Buried is the second feature film by young Spanish director Rodrigo Cortés based on Chris Sparling's script, and produced and shot in Spain. Cortés got the script after it had been rejected by most film studios, and he found it a crazy challenge worth of being carried out. From the very beginning, he wanted to shoot the film in the coffin, with no exteriors, and Ryan Reynolds to be the protagonist. Reynolds thought that the script was impossible to shoot and said no; Cortés insisted and sent him his first movie and a long report about why the movie should be shot and Reynolds should be in it.The movie was filmed on a tight budget in Barcelona in over two weeks. The shooting of the film was very hard and challenging from the technical, engineering and emotional point of view, as the film has no exteriors, the filming happens inside a wooden box, and Reynolds had to play the movie alone, entirely in the coffin.This is one of those movies that you have to watch in a cinema, with the lights off, so you can put yourself in Paul Conroy's shoes, both physically and emotionally, and feel what is like to be buried. The use of camera and lighting are fantastic, very complex but very well executed. The atmosphere is terrific. The script makes very good points about how little American corporations and Government care about their employees/citizens in the Middle East, and also about the preconceptions that the people in those areas of the world have about individual Americans being all rich and powerful not just working class employees.Reynolds is brilliant in his performance of Paul Conroy, and it is a shame that he wasn't nominated for the Oscars that year; he really deserved it. This is Reynolds' best and most serious performance to the date, and shows the great actor he is; why does he keep accepting unsubstantial roles in Hollywood movies?! The voices heard through the phone were recorded after the shooting was finished; however, Reynolds needed a real counterpart to help him to get into character, so his acting coach played the different characters, live, and Reynolds heard her through a tiny earpiece. The performances of the actors whose voices we hear are excellent and they transmit great emotion and feeling to the viewer, despite the viewer not being able to see them.The main problems with the movie are, firstly, its tempo. The thrill is there from the beginning, no rest, and although it goes in crescendo, the viewer can get tired of over-thrilled, so to speak. Secondly, I think it would have been better for the viewer seeing exteriors and the actors we hear on the phone, so the viewer gets a bit of relief from the claustrophobic settings. Thirdly, two of the main premises of the script are so wrong that make the rest impossible to believe: 1/ If you are buried alive in a coffin underground, and you lift your zippo, the flame is going to consume part of the very little air you have, if you have any when you wake up, and you'll be dead quite soon. Moreover, once the oxygen is used, and less is left, the person buried will have stained air to breath, and his vital functions, strength and mental abilities will be weakened. Nothing of what happens in the movie would be possible. A torch would have been a better option, worked the same in the story, but made the settings credible. 2/ If you are buried with your cell phone, even if not very deep underground, your phone is not going to work, even if you have a powerful 3G/satellite network available, which is not the case in countries like Iraq or the Middle East, especially in isolated areas. I get that sort of problem in city underground settings in my city, can you imagine in a buried coffin in Iraq? Not believable at all.Having said this, this is a very entertaining experimental film, that approaches the script in the most original dazzling way, and has a terrific performance by Ryan Reynolds. The film got a phenomenal positive reception at Sundance, but unfortunately his commercial release and distribution were very limited.",Buried
90,jlthornb51,Stunningly Suspenseful,8,29 April 2015,"Ryan Reynolds gives a terrific performance as a man buried alive by terrorists following an attack on his truck convoy in Iraq. From the opening shot to the starkly powerful closing scene, this is a motion picture that never lets up and holds the audience mesmerized in their seats. A sharp, intelligent script coupled with superb direction give this film uncanny intimacy. It is unrelenting in its overwhelming tension and dark realism. Over the course of 90 minutes, we are on a roller coaster of horror and emotionally held hostage, much like the character of Paul Conroy. As an Everyman victim of war and terror, Reynolds excels in this difficult role. The climax is shattering and one of the most intense in the history of cinema.",Buried

What I mean by it's a hard watch? It's very intense all the time. There's no breathers or anything of the sort, it's from the second it starts to the second it ends, it's 1000mph intensity.Disclaimer to anyone who hasn't seen. This is essentially Ryan Reynolds in a box for 90 minutes. There's no flashbacks, no shots of the outside world in anyway. And I thought it was really good. Ryan did a phenomenal job of acting and really sold the performance. The cinema work was brilliant and not only visually, but it managed to capture the emotion of being trapped so well. For such a simple story, they did a brilliant job of keeping the audience engaged. I do have one issue with it and unfortunately it makes this film go from a 7 to a 6/10.The ending. (Spoiler time)I don't like doing reviews with spoilers but I have to vent about the ending. So essentially, he dies. My question is what's the point? You're literally with Ryan Reynolds for 90 minutes constantly. You gain an attachment to him and all for it to mean absolutely nothing. It felt like a kick in the teeth. Especially when it bigs up the idea he is close to being saved several times. I get to an extent why they did it. For realism. For that hard hitting feeling. But I just personally hate these endings, because there's no outcome. I feel like I wasted my time. Obvuaouly it's completely down to interpretation, but yeah that's my view on it.",Buried

There is no predicting this.The movie is about an American guy that works in Iraq as a delivery driver... his convoy gets attacked and he gets hit on the head with a rock and gets knocked out. When he wakes up he is in a coffin buried in the desert. All he has with him is a phone, lighter, torch, pencil and alcoholic drink.Seeing as the whole film is set in a box, it is really not boring.

It had me hooked from the onset, and built towards a really shocking and thrilling conclusion. I really enjoyed the story and thought that it maintained a great pace, which is vital for a film of this genre. There were maybe a few moments where things drifted off course, but for the most part it was solid.Ryan Reynolds was great, which is handy considering he was essentially the sole performer in the film. For large parts of the film he had no dialogue, so he brought his A game in terms of his physical performance.The camera work was very accomplished, managing to capture the claustrophobic environment without limiting the way the film looked.A very solid and enjoyable thriller.

95,nitzanhavoc,A vivid lucid nightmare you simply MUST watch!!!,9,25 January 2013,"As a devout Horror fan, I've seen a few films that were considered ""single location"" films (amongst them Saw, Hunger, Panic Room). However, Buried (which isn't tagged as Horror but is horrific and horrifying enough) has really lived up to that definition, and is actually shot entirely from within a coffin (I wouldn't have mentioned that had it not been published here in the Trivia, another proof to how stupid IMDb can be sometimes...)One location, one actor and a cellphone. As minimalist as can be. Original and almost genius in its screen writing, direction, cinematography, editing and acting. Simplicity taken to the next level. The entire film feels like a very realistic nightmare of sorts, as we follow the protagonist on at the edge of our seats and nerves and pray for his redemption.I can't say watching this film has been fun, or enjoyable. It's a psychological torture of anxiety, frustration and pain. It only gets worst as the events unfold. However, not all worthy experiences are about fun. Buried is as realistically terrible as an excellent film could be.On a more personal note, I'm a big fan of twists and ""Easter eggs"", and Buried doesn't really have any of those (but for the shocking ending) and I believe that's the one thing that kept it from being a true masterpiece.If you've seen ""Brake"", you now know where it must have gotten some of its ideas.

Paul Conroy is a contract truck driver trying to make ends meet to support his family in Detroit. Paul must decide whether or not to comply with what the terrorists want over the phone of give them nothing and help the State department in tracking him.Buried is a Hitchcockian thriller, including the opening credits. You think you know everything until something changes and the stakes are even higher. Sparling's well crafted story never eases up, always pushing us more and more until we scream alongside Reynolds in a last effort to escape that damned coffin.This is a squirmy movie. Like 127 Hours, we are trapped with the main character in a tight, confined space. We get to know the space, its ins and outs, where objects are placed. We can almost smell the air. Director Rodrigo Cortés utilizes several setups and angles to film inside the coffin. Each shot is precise, some timed to music. Though some scenes drag and could be cut, overall it's a very tight, well crafted production.Reynolds really cuts loose. He is given free reign inside the coffin. From start to finish he never settles down, but can you blame him? Every second in the coffin is one step closer to death. He knows it, we know it. With everyone cough, every bar of battery life dwindling away, the anxiety rises. Reynolds plays it perfectly, reacting to every demand, every voicemail, and every text. Without his commitment to the role, the film falls through. This isn't your typical situation horror film. This has a heart.Those who have trouble dealing with small spaces, steer clear of this one.

Even the thought of being in Ryan Reynolds' shoes in the movie petrifies me. This is a very difficult film to watch, but it is very well made. It is always a tough ask to keep the viewer engrossed when a film involves only a single person trapped somewhere making phone calls, but the director has certainly successfully managed to achieve just that. The film isn't flawless. You have to suspend a bit of disbelief to accept everything that happens. One or two phone calls that he makes are a little over the top and sensationalised. But as a whole I was greatly impressed by the direction and the realism of the cinematography. Ryan Reynolds has to be given a special mention as he singularly carries the film with a tour de force performance. I think the film is a metaphor to show how ordinary people live in a state which is not very different to the plight of Reynolds in the film. We are trapped in a society and surrounded by cobwebs of pointless, redundant formalities and paperwork(like the formalities which the govt. departments kept resorting to in the film to ensure that their reputations remain intact) and we are figuratively enslaved by people in the high society who don't care about us.",Buried
99,EthanBJones_03,I'd rather be buried alive than watch this movie again.,3,31 May 2017,"'BURIED' was directed by Rodrigo Cortes and stars Ryan Reynolds. ​ Paul Conroy(Ryan Reynolds) is a US truck driver working in Iraq who is taken hostage and buried alive when his convoy is attacked. He needs to use his quick thinking and phone provided to either impress his captors, or get US to find him.I love the premise of this movie. I really do. It's a stupidly clever idea that COULD have made a wickedly clever thriller/satire. As far as I'm concerned, it is not. It's competently acted, well directed and supported by a great premise but it lacks a solid script to carry it all the way through. Ryan Reynolds does a good job as Paul Conroy and tries to make me like him but I just couldn't. That is my main flaw with this movie; I wanted Conroy to die. Death would have been mercy for what I would have done to him. All he did was whine and over react and claim people were trying to screw him over. I'm not saying he acted entirely out of line at point but he needed to have redeeming qualities to make him a compelling protagonist but he just doesn't. That's my honest to god main flaw with the movie but it's so frustrating that it drops the movie an absurd amount of points, which is really sad.The story of this movie was really poorly written and that is a shame considering the excellent premise. That said, I adored the ending and the questions it raises but I don't think 10 minutes excuses 75 minutes of mediocrity. There seems like no actual purpose to the movie, which would be fine in most movies but I think this movie sorely needed it. Granted, it did make me consider some things but I don't think that was the movie's intention and I wholeheartedly believe that making it a satire, or giving it a proper message would have made it better.One thing I do like and will praise in this movie is Cortes' direction. This is a very good looking movie, especially considering the restrictions of the coffin. I appreciate how Cortes uses the lighting to direct the story in various directions and feel that was a genius method to tel the story but I still don't think that that makes up for the movie's other flaws.Honestly, my main flaw with this movie is how unlikable of a character Conroy is. If he had even the slightest redeeming qualities, I would rate this movie much higher. That said, he isn't, and for that reason alone I cannot recommend this movie and will rate it 3 out of 10 pointless snakes.",Buried
100,ttapola,Buried Alive,9,2 October 2010,"No review of this film should contain spoilers. One cannot go into theater without knowing the premise (unless one has been conned there, heh!), and that's all that should be revealed to anyone who has not seen this remarkable film. IMDb tells us that the English name in Japan for Buried is Limit, which, intentional or not, is quite appropriate: Buried takes the concept of ""one location"" thrillers such as Hitchcock's Lifeboat and Fincher's Panic Room to the absolute limit of the concept and emerges superior to both films.One coffin. One man inside. Roughly 88 minutes between the stylish and mood-setting title sequence (something sadly lacking from especially American films these days) and the stark end credits. The first question that came to my mind when I heard the premise was: ""How can they possibly fill the runtime?"" After seeing the movie, I was stunned: it actually felt *longer* - which in this case is good, since the intent is to get the audience to feel like they are in the coffin with the trapped man. You bet a short time can feel like an agonizing eternity.The inventive script by Chris Sparling is like a masterclass lesson of how to make the most out of very little. Of course, this would not matter if the actor and/or director botched their parts. Thankfully, Ryan Reynolds reveals himself to be an actor worthy of demanding roles and director Rodrigo Cortés presents it all in just the right way. I will follow their careers with an interest from here onward. Now, when I was leaving the cinema, I heard some teenagers behind me complaining, ""What a boring movie - the whole time in one space."" Oh, the Saw generation. Unless there is messy, ADD editing and gallons of blood plus noisy fake metal soundtrack, they don't get it. Buried is thriller done the old fashioned way - the *right* way. Simplicity is the key, like in Paranormal Activity. A truly unnerving sound FX design and music that prevents you from breathing combined with innovative shooting angles and a frighteningly realistic performance from the lead combine into a thoroughly compelling ride. If some kids don't get it, fine. Let us more mature viewers appreciate this little gem. 9/10 (it's not perfect, but to talk about the flaws would be to spoil this film). Seeing this in the dark silence of a movie theater where you can't press Pause or Stop will yield the maximum effect.",Buried

102,dvc5159,Perhaps the most claustrophobic film I've ever seen; a visceral and terrifyingly engaging film-going experience.,7,15 October 2010,"Some of our biggest fears involve being trapped in a closed-space and being alone in the dark. In ""Buried"", director Rodrigo Cortés and star Ryan Reynolds perfectly combine these two phobias together to create an utterly terrifyingly realistic, and (thus) nightmarish film.Ryan Reynolds is given the huge task of carrying the entire film on his shoulders. He is, simply put, an ordinary guy who is buried alive by someone for some reason. In the coffin which imprisons him, the closest things to his companion are his lighter and a cell phone which he found in the coffin with him. But all is not what it seems, and as Paul gets closer to the truth his situation goes from bad to much, much worse. This is perhaps the most claustrophobic film I've ever seen, with 94 minutes of nothing but Ryan Reynolds trapped in a very enclosed box with little time and no way out. It's an absolutely thrilling, gripping, absorbingly engaging and visceral experience you may not forget anytime soon once you've seen it.Granted, the voices over Paul's new-found BlackBerry are the closest thing to a supporting cast you can get, because Reynolds is the only actor you see on the screen. Reynolds is known for many a romantic comedy and/or action movies with his good looks and charm, but here, not only does Reynolds manage to grab the audience's attention, he delivers an utterly captivating and emotionally-charged performance, with genuine fear, anger, and desperation any normal person would express under these circumstances. He deserves an Oscar nomination in the least for his highly commendable performance, and here's hoping for better roles for him in the future. If not, well Reynolds can at least still be proud of this film as it's the highlight of his career/his best performance ever.Just because the film takes place in only one location with only one star doesn't mean that it does not have a story. As Paul tries to get help with his cell phone, his purpose for being there is slowly revealed. Cortés and screenwriter Chris Sparling cleverly weaves the plot and dialogue around Reynolds' situation while not showing the world outside, or flashbacks, split cams... none of that. A very risky, but ultimately ingenious decision which pays off brilliantly and has shades of Hitchcock all over it. This is rock-solid film-making, where simplicity has proved again to be the key to getting it done right, instead of overblown Hollywood techniques used in many of today's blockbusters.The technical aspects are outstanding as well. Using a low $3 million budget, Cortés and his crew make the best out of it. Unique cinematography helps add tension and helplessness to Paul's situation. The music score is ominous and is revealed at exactly the right moments to bring out the emotion in the audience and NOT revealing the scares like in many horror/thrillers todays. It's refreshing.There you have it. One of the most terrifying, disturbing, and nightmarish thrillers in years, and all done with no flashy special effects and/or editing, no overblown action sequences and/or music, and no pretty faces and bodies in sight. Just a man, a box, and plenty of thrills.Two warnings before watching this film: One: This film is not for everybody. Those who prefer films set in more than one location or like fast-paced action thrillers may not like this film. Two: The film's dark and maxed-out claustrophobic setting may be deeply unsettling for people who have those type of fears. You have been warned.Having said that, this is a thriller that left me shaken and stirred. It's a sleeper of a film in a sea of blockbusters. See it before its run expires from the screens. If you want to know what it's like being buried alive, this film will kill your curiosity.... and make you never question it again.Overall value: 84/100(P.S. - This is based on my new ratings scale after comparing and judging my entire vote history. I pushed almost every movie a rating back but was too lazy to edit my reviews. Hence, this would get a 9/10 if I hadn't modified my scale.)",Buried
103,gary-444,A Conceptual Triumph,8,20 October 2010,"An incredibly difficult film to rate objectively and review. The story is that of Paul Conroy, played by Ryan Reynolds, whom we find entombed, in darkness, somewhere in Iraq, held hostage. This is a one-hander shot on a single set. The ultimate low budget conception. So you can forget cinematography, location and supporting actors. What you are left with is one man's performance, a compelling story, excellent camera work (it has to be!) and THE question- will he escape? This is a Spanish made and financed film with distribution in Europe, Japan and the USA. I do not think this will be to American tastes. There is no big budget, no special effects, no chases and no shoot-outs. Furthermore, Reynolds' claim that he is ""just a truck driver"" helping to reconstruct Iraq is shamelessly exposed to his captors riposte that the Americans shouldn't have wrecked the country in the first place. The ambush and fire fight which resulted in his capture is mentioned but not shown – guaranteed to send Hollywood executives into apoplexy.""Buried"" takes its inspiration from cave-in and submarine disaster films of the past- and then ratchets up the tension to the maximum. You are alone, you don't know where you are, you can barely see, you can barely move, you can barely breathe, and you are running out of air. The skill of the screenplay by Chris Sparling is that it identifies our dark primeval fears, and then plays them out through Reynolds. It is that Everyman connection which works.Once the audience understands the situation, it then begs a subliminal challenge. How much drama can you get from a man in a box? The answer is plenty. As Reynolds starts to get to grips with his surroundings, so do we. A mobile phone whose charge is waning as Reynolds prospects wane, is his only contact with the outside world , to his would be rescuers, and his captors. But all we hear are their voices. And what he does hear is not good. His captors want an impossible ransom, his employers have sacked him due to an alleged affair negating insurance monies to his family, and contacting his family his family is fraught with problems. All we hear is voices, of hope, love, rejection, alienation, isolation and threat. We hear what Reynolds hears, we see what he sees, crucially we imagine what he imagines drawing us in.Although well plotted, with skillful story development, the dialogue itself is workmanlike, rather than inspired. The scenario provided for inspiring monologues, instead we get staccato bursts of communication with the outside world. How intentional this is, is unclear. The advantage is that this depersonalises Reynolds and externalises his dilemma, the disadvantage is that we don't really care about his fate as a person. Yet ironically neither do his employers, the kidnappers or maybe even the rescuers. He really is on his own.What defines ""Buried"" is the courage of the film makers to have an idea, and see it through. It must have been so tempting to introduce some exterior shots and to show some flashbacks to ease the claustrophobia. They didn't. Artistically that is brave and pays dividends. All were wisely eschewed in favour of the stark, austere but pure compelling vision which makes this film such a success – on its own terms..",Buried

105,Bloodwank,"Terrific, ultra claustrophobic suspense nightmare",9,2 September 2010,"Buried is a film that keeps things deadly simple, one character, one location and a one line but horribly inspired plot, those looking for flashy visuals or big action should turn far, far away from this one. It's worth noting though that the film is well directed and photographed, director Rodrigo Cortes has a nimble eye for visuals and angles to keep things visually interesting, while cinematographer Eduard Grau gets the best out of the mere two light sources to make the experience a frighteningly vivid one. The plot sees Ryan Reynolds waking up in a coffin, with nothing more than a cell-phone and his lighter to help him out, things develop through his series of fraught, occasionally bleakly amusing and increasingly desperate communications with the outside world. Its rather interesting to see a film so based around interactions on a mobile phone, devices so often objects of fear, suspicion, or in the case of some horror films and of course the cinematic experience for the viewer, irritations. Here every ring is crucial, the battery bar is nail-biting, even the light of the screen is important. For me, just as interesting was the choice of lead. I've never had time for Ryan Reynolds, a face from some of the worst in lowbrow comedy and someone I never expected to appreciate breaking through into not just serious film but something as bold in its structure as this. A lot of people are likely to dislike the film on a fundamental level, but Reynolds gives the performance of his life here, running through a rainbow of emotions, angry, sarcastic and terrified are but a few. Compelling and sympathetic, likely physically arduous too (though I'd don't know how the film was made it must have been tough, barring serious trickery) he holds the film wonderfully. The script is of course of utmost importance too, and writer Chris Sparling does mostly terrific work. An ordinary man reacting as best he can to a nightmare, drawing on the sort of resourcefulness he probably hoped he'd never need, occasionally breaking down but keeping ploughing on, shades of dark humour in the protagonist's travails on the phone, its endlessly interesting and as time goes on, nail-bitingly suspenseful. I had minor issues with realism in the film, and there was at least one interesting little aside that could have been developed a bit more, but overall this is a great achievement. It surely won't appeal to everyone and my rating might seem generous, but for doing this well on such a risky concept, and putting together a suspenser that remains thought provoking after, a 9/10 from me.",Buried
106,Eternality,"The dark humor, macabre approach, and suspense filmmaking employed in Buried are lasting testaments of Hitchcock's enduring influence.",7,10 October 2010,"2010's undisputed high concept-low budget thriller, Buried delivers an experience unlike anyone has ever encountered. It fulfills much of its promise, but is sometimes let down by its conformance to the viewer's gratifying needs. Directed and edited by Rodrigo Cortes, the film centers on only one character throughout the entire film. His name is Paul Conroy (played by a very convincing Ryan Reynolds), and he finds himself in an extremely dire situation that would easily be anyone's worst nightmare – buried alive in a coffin.A non-military truck driver working in Iraq, Paul is ambushed and knocked out. He wakes up to find himself trapped in a coffin buried underground in the middle of a desert. He has with him, among other things, a mobile phone with a rapidly depleting battery, a lighter, and a pocket knife. He has ninety minutes to deliver the demands of the ""terrorist"" who put him there, otherwise he would be left to die in the most traumatizing manner imaginable.Shot strictly from the perspective of a live person in a coffin, Buried is probably the first film in the history of cinema to have done so for its entire runtime. It is not a breakthrough in the purest sense, but Cortes' film is certainly a very original (and disturbing) take on the theme of claustrophobia. In such an immobile state, which is the more frightening? Total darkness? Suffocation by the lack of oxygen? Suffocation by sand seeping in? Discovering a large, black snake by your side? Buried aggregates these phobias, and attempts to create a very harrowing situation in which time becomes the overarching factor affecting the protagonist's chances of survival. Ninety minutes are all Paul has got, and not surprisingly, that is the runtime of the film. Cortes' method of building suspense is through manipulating space and time, or rather through the lack of it. The camera ingeniously shows the extent of Paul's confinement by keeping to only a few angles, even though behind-the-scenes footage show that many of the scenes are shot with various cross-sections of the coffin.The use of light from a half-functioning torch, lighter, light sticks, and mobile phone for lighting purposes in the film is clever because the effect is at once minimalist, raw, and eerie. Late on in the film, there is a hopeful fantasy sequence by Paul that shows him on the verge of being rescued. In this short sequence, blinding sunlight enters his eyes as the lid of the coffin is removed. As a result, he could not see anyone. Yet could his ""inability to see anyone"" also be symbolic, like a kind of foreboding prediction of the inevitable? Would anyone come to Paul's aid? Scenes showing him frantically dialing emergency numbers only to find that the line is busy, or that the person manning the phone is impatient and not well-equipped to handle the situation, are strong criticisms against the society he is, and by extension, we are raised in – bureaucratic, self-centered, and suspicious. Even though Buried is reasonably suspenseful, there are still moments that are done just for the sake of gratifying the audience (like the above-mentioned snake sequence).Lastly, I would like to point out an interesting observation. In 1948, the great Hitchcock made Rope, a film about two murderers secretly strangling their classmate in his home. They place his dead body in a coffin, and then attempt to camouflage it by converting it into a table. They then invite the victim's unknowing family and friends over for a small party of sorts.If Rope represents one end of an arbitrary spectrum, Buried would be in the other. The former deals with a dead person in a coffin surrounded by people. On the other hand, the latter, in an outside-in approach, explores a live person in a coffin surrounded by no one. The dark humor, macabre approach, and suspense filmmaking employed in Buried are lasting testaments of Hitchcock's enduring influence. It is not the best of cinematic tributes, but it is a unique one nonetheless.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Buried
107,ginocox-206-336968,A gripping thriller with a powerful message,10,8 July 2015,"""Buried"" is a compelling and effective thriller that not only keeps the audience on edge for its duration, but makes an effective political statement without resorting to contrived plots and unbelievable characters. It is essentially a one-man show for Reynolds, who delivers a stellar performance, similar to Hardy's performance in ""Locke."" Both characters are trapped in boxes, Hardy's is a comfortable BMW, Reynolds's is a rough wooden box. Both are alone, surrounded by darkness, able to communicate only by cell phone as their worlds collapse and they hurtle toward destinies dictated by the choices they made. Both are excellent films. While ""Locke"" is a polished human drama, ""Buried"" is a gritty horror/thriller. The film makes a powerful political statement about our nation's involvement in foreign wars and the consequences of such involvement, the limitations of the government's policy to never negotiate with terrorists (which has recently been revised) and our inability to protect our citizens who engage in humanitarian efforts to repair the damage caused by our wars. And it does so subtly and effectively. One might criticize the film for failing to offer alternatives or solutions. The plot is a little heavy on coincidences. One can't help but wonder about oxygen supply; however, the villains have evidently done this before and may have found a solution, such as an air duct outside the roughly hewn coffin. But these are minor nitpicks. The filmmakers did an amazing job with what was evidently a limited budget. The movie doesn't feel like a low-budget thriller. They used a lot of talent and creativity to create a visually impressive and emotionally haunting film.",Buried

Couldn't think of anything better.Well done but with some flaws.As an experiment in minimalism, it did a very good job of maximizing its restrictions. Many fine shots and creative uses of the space. The subjective shots went over well, too.Tension and pacing were at a good level. I was vague if Reynolds passed out during the fade-to-blacks. If so, it was overused. Strangely I didn't feel claustrophobic and I very much can be in real life.I especially like that we didn't leave the coffin. You get these movies in tight spaces then it segues to somewhere else: flashbacks, cops trying to find them, etc. I probably would be outvoted by the viewing audience, but I like that it kept to the space. Phone Booth comes mind. It was effective in that small space, although many things were going on just outside. And there were flashbacks in that. Both worked.I was sketchy on the elaborate nature of the bad guy's plan. Make the victim hunt down his own ransom from a coffin under the ground? Stupid. And making him cut off his finger? That was more for the movie and not the bad guy's plan. But I let them go in favor of the variety of compelling scenarios it provided.And one of those rare instance that you really didn't have to establish the main character. Guy buried in a coffin against his will? I don't care who you are but I'll have sympathy for that guy. And a clue to his personality in his possessions was well done.And it ended as a tragedy with a subjective cheat just before. Capped by up-tempo quirky and ironic music. It all left me with a satisfying but bitter taste in my mouth.There was no other way to go.",Buried

Throughout the film we learn that Paul was a truck driver working in Iraq until he was attacked. Now he finds himself buried, running out of air and most importantly, time. With only a cell phone, a cigarette lighter and a pen can Paul find his way out and actually escape this nightmare alive?If you personally struggle with confined spaces (or you're generally claustrophobic) this movie might not be for you. Our leading man is the only actor depicted on screen and the entire duration of the film takes place underground... in a closed box. Because of this, the film is naturally dark, also meaning you will want to hope your TV can handle blacks really well in order to truly enjoy the film and feel a part of it.Considering the film's runtime, I was amazed at how gripping and entertaining I found Buried. With only one the actor on screen, Ryan Reynolds reminds cinema lovers that he knows how to deliver an extremely thrilling performance and is not just a funny man all the time. As the film progressed I found myself passionately cheering on our leading character on as he makes phones calls and deals with multiple problems one after the next. I will admit that films like these are generally ""a watch it once only"" type of film but nevertheless, it's definitely worth the experience if you haven't seen this film before.Overall, Buried is a surprisingly good thriller, especially considering the film relies on one actor in one location. Buried never feels dull nor boring, but instead feels like a ticking bomb just waiting to go off. Ryan Reynolds delivers a surprising dramatic performance which will leave audiences struggling to breathe as the credits roll.8.3/10

112,luke-a-mcgowan,Masterpiece in suspense and minimalisation,10,27 March 2016,"1. Seeing what a good actor Ryan Reynolds is in this movie is what made me excited for Deadpool. He is literally the only actor in the movie, and he is confined to a box approximately seven by four feet. That's the entire movie, for ninety minutes. And I could not look away.2. The opening scenes are frightening. Those off-centre shots of his terrified face, frozen as the light vanishes as soon as it appears are somewhat reminiscent of a horror movie like The Blair Witch Project.3. The way the light illuminates the screen creates an intensity in itself, as Paul's small sources of light go through their degrees of reliability are frightening, especially with Paul's heavy breathing in the darkness reminding us that things go on even when we can't see them.4. The screenplay's dialogue is flawless. Paul is disoriented in his panic, as would be anyone in the situation, but rather than delaying the story it actually creates the atmosphere even more. The unhelpful conversations as Paul tries to contact them make you frustrated just as Rodrigo Cortes continues to stifle you with the sense of claustrophobia.5. The most frightening thing about Buried is that its entirely believable. Movies like The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield are scary because ""what if"" but a movie like Buried would be a nightmare for anyone who has ever spent time in the Middle East.6. That ending will straight up rip you in half.7. There needs to be more movies like Buried.",Buried

Should have been over in 15 minutes if the guy had seen a film like Kill Bill 2. But of course we had 90 minutes to fill so instead our 'hero' was in fact a brain dead American who had the survival skills of a lemming. The first thing he does is drains the battery of the handy phone his captors left by phoning everyone in America to shout at them instead of finding someone who could help and just phoning them. After that he does his best to drain the array of handy lights scattered around and use up his oxygen by having hissy fits and lighting a Zippo. When he does get in touch with someone who can help who gives him handy information such as he is likely buried a few feet below ground he wastes time doing a survey with his bosses who want to disown him. Most non Americans would have used the knife to break out and moled their way to the surface but then we would not have had the climactic ending which resulted in much sadness as Coffin Boy found out his rescuers had rescued the wrong coffin. All this shows the viewing audience is that Americans really should not be allowed to stray more than a 100 yards from their home as they are incapable of survival and poor at stress situations.

115,Jerique,Masterpiece!,9,12 March 2011,"This has to be my most favourite Ryan Reynolds movie of all time. His performance is breath taking. How exactly do you make a movie about a guy in a coffin without any cut-aways or flashbacks? This is how. Alfred Hitchcock would have been impressed.Paul Conroy (Reynolds) wakes up in a wooden coffin at the beginning of the movie. This movie does an even better job than Saw or Phone Booth to keep the audience on their toes for the entire 90 minutes without leaving the coffin. Literally, it is like real time of watching Ryan in the coffin for an hour and a half.Conroy wakes up with his hands tied up and his mouth gagged. He discovers a zippo lighter and then a blackberry cell phone. He begins to get phone calls from a terrorist demanding $5 million by that night at 9 PM. He attempts to get help from the FBI and other organizations, but feels helpless.It's such a breathtaking performance by Reynolds. I think it's his best yet. He doesn't seem to play a character but he seems like the character. It's a disturbingly great movie though. I loved every second of it.Besides Ryan's Oscar-worthy performance the best thing in this film is the amazing cinematography. I think the director of photography is a genius. He gives a different lighting for all of Conroy's devices (ie. blue tint for the blackberry, yellow tint for the lighter). It's mesmerizing. Truly an incredible film and one of my favourites of all time.I'm glad I got to see it, but I would've preferred to have had it released in Canada (more than just Toronto). I don't see how a limited release helped this film. But, I sure hope the DVD and Blu-Ray sales make up for the flopped box office revenue and allow for people to see this masterpiece!",Buried
116,bazmitch23,"Buried, a one man show starring Ryan Reynolds.",8,11 February 2014,"When I tell people the plot of this movie, they go ""Oh, I wouldn't watch that."" There's a lot of claustrophobic people. Which pretty much killed this film's box office takings.But I liked the fact that it's focused on one man throughout the whole film. It's like watching a one man show on stage. I'm not the world's greatest Ryan Reynolds' fan. He's always the same character in every role he plays, but he goes against type in this film. I love it when actors and actresses go against type. He does a great job of carrying this movie on his own. And that's hard to do. I read a lot of negative reviews on this site saying the lighter uses up all his oxygen, the people he calls are pricks (they don't make an effort to help him and Stephen Tobolowsky plays his typical nonchalant guy who can't give a care in the world), the only guy who is trying to get him out is Dan Brynner. I agree with the negative reviews on those opinions.Also, his mobile phone has good reception six feet under? Paul's able to write upside down? The whole Iraqi terrorist thing is clichéd. We've seen it before.Yeah, the scene with the snake (done with really bad CGI) is pointless. It comes out of his jeans. (here's a lyric from Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: ""Hooray for you one eye trouser snake"") Also, we see the snake come out of a hole at the side of the coffin. Couldn't Paul try to kick the hole to make it bigger and try to get out from the side of the coffin? But I liked the way the film was made. Trying to film an entire movie inside a coffin is unfilmable and that's a risk the director wanted to take. Some people love a challenge. I liked the way it was shot and the music was intense too.I also loved the colours the filmmakers used: Green from the glow stick, blue from the mobile phone, red from the torch, yellow from the lighter.The ending I thought was really effective, but then it's ruined by a cheery uppy song in the credits. Yeah, a song like that is not right to go with an intense finale.If you want to see a movie that is focused on only one actor and only has one setting, check it out.",Buried

After an attack by a group of Iraqis he wakes to find he is buried alive inside a coffin. With only a lighter and a cell phone it's a race against time to escape this claustrophobic death trap.Claustrophobic, intense, and incredibly good, Buried gets it right. If you hear about a movie that takes place ONLY in a coffin and one actor, and your still entertained, that's great film-making. In this one-man- show adventure, Buried is clichéd. It's nowhere near original or something new, but the outcome is overall great. The final minutes will leave you awe-inspired, some scenes will leave you at the edge of your seat, and some scenes will leave you thinking what would you do in this situation? I enjoyed the hell out of myself. Ryan Reynold's acting, for one, shines throughout. I always thought he was this overrated actor only known for his looks, but through that, he actually has some skills. Then we go on to the directing. I thought the movie was filmed stylish and fantastic. Some of the scenes reminded me of 127 hours; the claustrophobic fear and the blurriness. After the acting and film- making, we move onto the plot. Although the genre has been used before, the film has some new elements and twists. The ending, the snake scene, or the excessive use of the phone will leave you speechless. And throughout, I had myself against my seat, wondering what could happen next? How could they possibly entertain us with a man in a coffin? And everything else in between. All in all, this movie gets it right. The people who complain and complain about every little thing; ignore. Rent, watch, and enjoy. Pointless? The point was to entertain, to leave a feeling after. Pulp Fiction had no point, but hell, it's at the top of the top 250. But nevertheless, I highly recommend this intense thriller that will seriously leave you loving it after. Buried... 8/10.",Buried

But okay... the plot is very interesting.This movie, together with The Hurt Locker (2008) are the best examples of what terror is and the triggers of its existence without showing a cliché war camp.Ryan Reynolds is pretty good and also a great choice because he carries entire movie on his back and does it perfectly, otherwise the movie would be something boring and unwatchable.The movie is claustrophobic, everyone will sense that in the very first second and there's no better way to make the audience understand what terror means because terror is much more than exploding buildings and cars... terror is a psychological thing that leads to a variety of explosive attitudes.Buried had everything to be a horrible movie, but Rodrigo Cortés did it with solid ideas leaded by an effective screenplay by Chris Sparling, remembering that both director and writer aren't so known in business. Surely this is one of the biggest surprises of 2010.",Buried

126,patryk-czekaj,A decent one-man show,7,28 April 2012,"How many movies, that take part only in one particular place, have you seen in your life? Maybe a couple. Were they any good? In most part, probably not. Because let's be honest, you wouldn't expect much from a movie that shows only one person for more than an hour doing God knows what (note:it may be a great experience if you are truly in love with the actor/actress). At first thought it just seems kind of boring.Surprisingly, Buried proves many people wrong. It definitely isn't a masterpiece, but for me it's a very decent average film. And it sure is watchable. It got me pinned to my seat throughout the whole screening, as the suspense kept rising and rising. I assumed that even Hitchcock wouldn't be ashamed to call Buried a fine thriller. Much of the contribution lies on the hands of Ryan Reynolds, who plays Paul Conroy, a US truck driver currently working in Iraq. He wakes up in a coffin deep beneath the ground without any memory of how he got there. In the 95 minutes of gripping fight for survival he tries everything to get out, with only a few items in his possession. The cell phone seems to be the key to his freedom. Yet, no one is able to locate him. Some people have already assumed his death. The people, who abducted him are only posing more and more threats and bleak promises. His desperate struggle seems impossible to be won as minutes are passing by. I want to mention one thing: the fact that the US government does very little to even assure Paul that everything is going to be alright isn't as much shocking as the one phone call that he makes to his employer. It presents the way that some companies treat their employees nowadays, and does it in a most brutal, yet very realistic manner.This absolutely isn't a film that you can watch more than once. Viewing it multiple times will just damage your opinion about its suspenseful atmosphere and ongoing tragedy. However, it is definitely a movie worth watching that one time. And when you do, try to put yourself in Paul's position and answer these questions: what would I do if I were in such a traumatic situation? Are there any more possible ways of saving myself in the end? is THIS the end?",Buried
127,priyantha-bandara,A novel yet tense experience,7,27 January 2011,"My rating: 3.5/5  Honestly this movie looks like it was made with a budget of $1000! And  most probably the director have used a wooden box with Ryan Reynolds in  it and few cameras in the whole 135 minutes. But despite all that,  seriously 'Buried' is not a bad movie at all. It's just purely new and  tense to look at and more enjoyable than many other high budgeted, cast  crowded flicks.   Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds-The Proposal, Just Friends) is a truck  driver who works in Iraq. After getting ambushed and attached by  insurgents he gets buried alive in a wooden coffin under the desert  sand. Its rather a box which is a little spacious than a usual coffin  which immediately comes to our minds but not spacious enough to be  comfortable. He discover a lighter, torch and a cellphone and some  other small stuff which makes sense when the plot start to reveal its  true colors. Later its exposed that rebels expects to demand a ransom  and so the story goes.   What purely fascinates me is that the movie never, I repeat never  leaves the wooden coffin. There are lot happens in the box and lot of  interaction with the outside world but all other people involved are  limited to voice acting. This gives an immense opportunity for the  viewer to be practically get stuck in the box with the main character  and just feel how he must be feeling. On top of that the fear mixed up  rage and frustration which builds up is wonderfully crafted throughout  the movie. I'm not gonna give out any spoilers about the ending or what  really happens in the box coz I really enjoyed the movie coz I never  knew much about it.  Ryan Reynolds does a wonderful job with his character. The roll is very  tough with limited moving space and lot of overflowing emotions. Very  good work done there for sure. And hats off to the sounds crew  including the dramatic score which play and huge part all the time.  More than any other movie the sounds really becomes so important in  this as visuals are not the key player for your imagination.   Overall 'Buried' is a very nice and scary experience. If you ask anyone  about their most deepest fears are, buried alive would be in the list.  Coz I know as it remain on a top position of my list.",Buried
128,vip-danii,"An Extremely Depressing, Unlikeable Movie",1,11 March 2013,"This is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. Definitely not for the faint-hearted or overly impressionable.A man is buried alive... and we get to watch him for an hour (or so) trying to get rescued i.e. making phone calls.This movie leaves a bitter aftertaste and an uneasy feeling, which might stay with you for a long time. It's actually quite unsettling in a way.The concept itself is somewhat original. It's actually a very simple, straightforward low-budget movie, yet incredibly effective.There are quite a few plot holes, though. I don't usually pay attention to that sort of stuff, but it was too obvious..For instance: ... he keeps burning his lighter almost non-stop throughout the movie, so how much oxygen *can* there be -- in that tiny coffin? ... why didn't he use his mobile phone for light? It is actually much brighter than the lighter and consumes no oxygen.... why didn't he use the knife to try and break out of the coffin? I think this would have been *anyone's* first instinct.... where *the hell* did that snake come from? If a snake can find its way out of the coffin (and since when do snakes live under ground???), why couldn't he at least *try* doing the same? .Plus, the lead (well, - the *only*) character is quite unlikeable, and you have no desire whatsoever to root for him.I did not like this movie, nor the protagonist, at all.",Buried
129,jake-law123,Ryan Reynolds in a box. Hold on to your seat belts!,9,6 March 2011,"This is probably the best thriller made in a really long time. This film blew me away with everything it had to offer. Although it was truly made as an experiment, I think it was a success. It gained popularity through itself, making it more unique than other films at the time. An entire film that takes place in a box, and shows nothing but Ryan Reynolds, how can you go wrong?After a minute and a half of stylish credits, then 2 minutes of heavy breathing darkness, our main character Paul Conroy, (Ryan Reynolds) wakes up, buried alive in a coffin to find it very hot and very hard to breath. Finding a cellphone and a lighter in the coffin, he makes multiple phone calls that get him nowhere, and also receives a call from his captor, demanding $5,000,000 within 2 hours or he'll be left to die. About halfway through, he gets in contact with a Hostage Working Group to help try and find him. As time grows more and more scarce, Paul's chances of survival fade faster.The entire film is in the coffin. It doesn't show a sliver of anything else. The whole film is centered around Ryan Reynolds trying to survive. Even when nothing is going on in the coffin, it will just show him laying there, it just refuses to show anything else. You could call it stubborn directing, I call it genius directing.I was surprised when I found the film immediately begins with him in the coffin. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought i'd show him get captured first, but then again that's what makes this film so unique. I feel like i'm in the situation, because everything he says to the captor, and the head of the working group, I feel like that's what I would say. Ryan Reynolds performance is excellent! This is without a doubt his breakthrough performance, and an improvement over the Proposal. His character gets frustrated, desperate, hopeless, all the key features of a film like this.The sound is also really good. His voice sounds so contained and muddled, along with everything else in the coffin, making you feel like you're in there with him. Even the small sounds of putting down the phone or flicking the lighter sound contained.Most people say the whole film is a build up to see whether or not he lives at the end, that after seeing the ending, you can't really see the film again. I disagree, I have so much re-watch value from this film. Watching him struggle desperately, along with the tension built up throughout is just so great to watch. His performance is incredibly underrated. I watched this film 5 times, and I would still be glad to watch it again. The film is so realistic that it feels like a real life situation, making it more amazing when you realize it's just a film.Compared to other films like Phone Booth or 127 Hours where the protagonist is stuck in one spot, I think this film dominates both films. It's much more intense and uneasy, because the situation is more desperate, not to mention the performance of Reynolds is the best. I think most people didn't like this film because they didn't like the ending, but I didn't mind it.Again, the best thriller made in a long time, very unique and very gripping. The concept of buried alive has always scared several, and it's hard to believe that nobody's made a film about it yet, well now they have, and i'm glad, because this is one great thriller!",Buried

131,RickHarvey,Buried,5,28 February 2011,"Spending 90 minutes in a coffin is no easy ride, neither for you or Reynolds. There not much to see or do when trapped inside a coffin in the middle of the Iraqi desert. So it absolutely vital that the script is tight with surprising twists and that the main character, the only character full fills everyone's expectations. Thankfully, Ryan Reynolds was riveting from start to end. He had to nail every emotion and he did just that.The use of camera shots and lightning was limited of course. After a while you become frustratingly fidgety. Mainly trammed with Close ups, you begin to lose interest towards the end. There are some nice shots such as loosening out from the coffin. You can only watch a man whack a torch, copying numbers down on wood, shouting on a phone before you begin to become restless.The ending was a surprise but the story wasn't enough to carry me to the end with a energetic, enthusiastic brain to truly be moved by it. Reynolds was top notch and all credits goes to him. The director did a splendid job despite the limitations. But overall, nothing special",Buried
132,magnuslhad,limited,5,5 June 2015,"Most of these experiments in one-actor, one-location filmmaking are self-aware in that testing the boundaries of the self-imposed limitations are always a salient concern. Some exceed those boundaries (Locke), while others seem stifled by them (All Is Lost). Buried does a good job of setting up its premise and making it plausible. A civilian contractor in Iraq is captured by local militia and buried for ransom. Ryan Reynolds brings guts to his portrayal of a working Joe in extraordinary circumstances trying to connect with his family in case he does not survive. Some episodes work better than others. The collapse of the roof of the coffin and the in-rushing of sand is viscerally terrifying. A recording by his erstwhile employers to allow them to fire him without compensation is just bad writing. It is also part of a coterie of voice actors who do not match Reynolds level of performance. A Brit who is the best hope for rescue is arid and wooden. The bad guy kidnapper is pure vaudeville, and occasionally lapses into a stagy Mexican accent. It is well-plotted, though the will-he won't-he ending is overcooked. The fad for these films is simply that, a fad, and I very much doubt anyone will watch this again. Stronger, richer stories will prevail and consign this to history's curiosity bin.",Buried

Despite the seriousness of the situation, i laughed out loud at paul's strained conversation with what appeared to be his mother in law and when he told her to F off once she had finally given him the information he needed. This movie was like reading a book, often when things are left to your imagination, the threat becomes more intense and I found that the case here, i was on the edge of my seat at the end wondering if paul would be rescued or not, thats rare for me. Summing up, this is a movie that on paper shouldn't work but it really does and it goes without saying this is a thinking mans movie and not one for the adventure junkies.",Buried
134,julian-mumford,Do not adjust your set...,7,25 June 2011,"Be warned the film starts and continues with a black screen for at least a minute or so, do not adjust your set. Listen carefully and sound effects begin to slowly emerge, a scrape here, a rushed breath there, the sound of sand slowly moving against wood.So starts an interesting film by director Rodrigo Cortes, who snags a Hollywood A-Lister in the form of Ryan Reynolds and puts him in a box. Not figuratively speaking, but quite literally and keeps him there for 95 minutes.Paul Conroy (Reynolds), is a civilian truck driver in Iraq and finds himself living out his own worst nightmare. This is a film that is as diametrically opposed to Reynold's turn as the ""Green Lantern"", as it is possible to get.One actor is seen throughout and there are no costume or set changes, minimalism is the keyword. Paul Conroy wakes up in a coffin, buried alive with only a few meagre items, Zippo lighter and pencil to his name. It's pitch black, the only lighting we see is the simulated illumination from his lighter.If you suffer from claustrophobia, this is not the film for you. This plays as a thriller but at it's core, this is a an exhausting human drama. What would you do, how might you react in similar circumstance. Would you be able to use the only really useful tool at your disposal, your mind? Latterly finding a mobile phone, Conroy makes ever more frustrated and terrified phone calls, and we share his exasperation and increasing desperation. Never have answer machines sounded so callous and uncaring, automated responses and switchboards representing possible life and death delay.Whilst we never see another actor, we do get to hear both sides of various telephone conversations with rescuers and family members. Alan Davenport (Tobolowsky) is particularly chilling as the HR director you cannot believe could exist but secretly know does. Modern audiences know that companies might act in exactly the same way portrayed, if circumstances demanded it.Cortez decides to play a non political game, focusing on one man's predicament rather than the wider picture. In doing so he exposes many of the larger truths that exist in the involvement of the US in Iraq and the indigenous populations reaction to their presence.Not so much terrorists and invaders, rather desperate people on both sides attempting to make a living in whatever way left open to them.Not for everyone but if the concept is interesting to you, the film is well written, well acted and well directed. Bearing in mind the static location, the camera remains fluid and the angles and obvious slight deceits on height and width, keep the viewer interested.The ending is not what you might expect or maybe it is, this will depend on your world outlook and glass half full/half empty philosophy.The film is relatively brief, which suits the subject matter and was filmed in 17 days in a Spanish studio, utilizing seven different coffins. The screenplay leaves the actor stripped of almost all props or artifice and as a consequence, the film completely rests on Reynolds acting ability and he does not disappoint.Summary Certainly not a horror film, despite the title. Whilst the film will do little for the Iraq tourist industry, it is certainly well worth a watch if the concept interests you.Recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",Buried
135,piratecannon,Boxing in the Audience,5,26 December 2012,"After having watched Sanctum earlier this afternoon, I suppose it's fitting that Buried was the next movie up on my docket for the weekend. What better way to follow-up one panic-inducing film than with another that's even more cramped for space?While the former at least gave its characters room to stand up straight, Buried takes the radical approach of having the entire movie be shot inside a simple plank coffin. At the start, there's no light, and we're only able to perceive what's happening through the anxious breathing of Paul Conroy, a contract trucker who has been taken hostage by Iraqi extremists. Light is soon provided via a Zippo, and later by glow sticks, a cell phone, and a rickety flashlight. Scene transitions are introduced with utter blackness, and it's every bit as claustrophobic as it sounds.Luckily for Paul, he's apparently not buried too far underground, as he's able to use the cell phone he's been provided to call loved ones, speak with his captor(s), and provide clues as to where he may be located. If ever there was a movie dependent on dialogue, this is it.The question, then, is this: does director Rodrigo Crotes' strategy of ""boxing in"" the audience payoff? The answer is both ""yes"" and ""no.""The always pervasive sensation that we, as viewers, are just as limited in terms of scope and oxygen as Paul is a very effective method of ratcheting up the terror to the ""nth"" degree. You'll likely find yourself wringing your hands as Paul attempts to complete some sort of bone-breaking maneuver in order to access the far-end of his box. When the lights temporarily go out from time to time, there's also the chilling realization of how paralyzing being sealed in a tight space underground would be (and, more than anything else, it makes us that much more appreciative that we're occupying spacious living rooms (etc.) and far removed from such unspeakable horrors).But then there's the actual plot. I suppose it was screenwriter Chris Sparling's idea to try and drum up something that's as realistic as possible, and, for all intents and purposes, one could argue that he succeeds. That being said, I found that the movie actually became boring as things progressed. The effectiveness of the setting and directorial decision making is tangible, but there comes a point where there's only so many ways one can inject scary things into an already terrifying situation.An attempt at characterization is made, as we witness Paul place calls to his mother (who appears to be suffering from Alzheimer's), his wife, and various company/government officials. The conversations are brief— as we'd expect—and they honestly don't add any worthwhile dimensions to a character who's already got every ounce of our sympathy because he's in one of the worst situations imaginable. On top of that, the sense that there are missed opportunities—especially when it comes to what Paul could do with his cellular device—is frustratingly concrete.Oh, and I won't even mention the hugely disappointing ending.Okay, so I just did.And, as unrelated as it is, one thought continued to plague me during just about every other scene: what would Beatrix Kiddo have done in this situation? Yeah, I know. There's no realism to that Kill Bill scenario whatsoever. But those five minutes are infinitely more entertaining the feature length exercise in tedium that Mr. Conroy (and the audience) is forced to endure with Buried",Buried
136,kclipper,"""Buried"" has no depth, and its about 85 minutes too long!!!",4,3 May 2011,"Now, I understand that this movie is what everyone is saying that it is, in all honesty it is every word that the critics are using ""intense"", ""claustrophobic"", ""nightmarish"". I also understand how it would occur to someone to make a film about one person alone in a state of absolute terror, and all the while staying focused on that event (meaning only one visible actor and one location) I understand the use of the camera angles to make you feel like you are in the box with the actor. With all this aside, This just does not work for me.The film is designed to provide the audience with the suspense of waking up to the horrific realization that they're buried alive. The panic and fear would be horrendous, but for it to work in a film, we need a little more. I respect subtlety in film-making. Especially when they're shooting for realism, and this film has that, but there was absolutely nothing else to go on for a 95 minute sit. The unanswered questions that you're pondering over through the film prevent you from enjoying the suspense. Why was this man kidnapped? Who are the kidnappers? Where is he buried? Is the box buried at all? What the hell is going on!!.....We are literally in the dark for 95 minutes with no other visible actors or sets, and each cell phone call he makes provides little or no clues to any rhyme or reason. Sitting through this movie is like trying to build a puzzle without knowing if you have the right pieces, and then finding out that you don't, and its too late. You just wasted 95 minutes of your time.I think this would have worked great as a short film. Ryan Reynold's performance is intense and believable, and its well directed, but it lacks the body and substance to be anything more than the uncomfortable, paranoid and claustrophobic experience that it sets out to be. I'm sorry I can't give this a good review, because the potential is definitely there, but there's just not enough depth. And if the suspense of being buried alive is what you're looking for, The scene in Kill Bill Vol. 2. will handle that, or I also may recommend the thriller ""Oxygen"", but for me, ""Buried"" is just that....Buried.",Buried
137,tubby1,A Buried Treasure,8,22 February 2011,"Although the idea of watching a man wriggle and squirm within the confines of an underground coffin seems a claustrophobic nightmare both for the protagonist and the viewer (where will the excitement come from?), Chris Sparling's clever screenplay ensures we are riveted to this startling predicament.The plausibility of the plot, that a truck driver would be buried alive as ransom for his release is a devilish but flawed concoction. Is this really the most effective manner for the kidnappers to ransom their asset? Nevertheless, when we get down to the nitty-gritty within the coffin I was satisfied with the manner in which it transpires.The film strength obviously relies on the screenplay and the acting of Ryan Reynolds, who does not fail to perform with the ferocity and desperation we can only imagine. The direction is very good and I for one never tired of being enclosed in this cinematic straight-jacket.For a film that refuses the audience additional stimuli by way of flashbacks etc, it really should be applauded.

Reynolds always seemed a decent actor, and I usually saw him in comical roles such as in Blade and Van Wilder. I would never expect him to be capable of serious acting. However, in this movie, Reynolds carries the whole movie. We only see him in a coffin, and he can hardly move. This requires a lot of skill to convey the sense of threat, and desperation to the audience, and Reynolds delivered. The voice acting was great too. The bad guy's voice was particularly menacing, and you could also feel the pent up anger and frustration. The directing and filming was amazing. It is a wonder so much tension could be achieved with so little. The only setting was in the coffin, and just when you start to adapt to the situation, a new problem arises. The pacing does not let up and forces you to concentrate on the story.

IT'S FULL OF SPOILERSWell, what a remarkable movie!!When it began with our only character already buried in a wooden coffin, I guess most people felt, as I did, that I was in for a torrid and uninteresting 90 minutes until the credits.Questions about the premise of the movie are many.How much useable air would there be in a coffin of the size our friend was in?Was it actually buried?Why was he using his Zippo so much knowing he had only limited air to breathe?And the big one - How was our friend able to contact 'phone numbers in the USA so easily while confined underground in Iraq? Is that even possible now, let alone at the time the movie was set (in 2006)?Certainly the movie had its faults but it was pretty damned credible over all; some scenes were truly terrifying and memorable. I'm thinking here of course of when our man found a snake in his coffin with him after he had a snooze.I have high praise for the makers of this movie because I'm sure they would have had to resist a lot of pressure to give the movie the Hollywood ending that I so much expected and feared. Remember what Hollywood did to George Sluizer's original excellent Dutch movie ""The Vanishing""? Both the original and the remake were made by the same director, Sluizer. The remake was just a disgrace when it had the happy Hollywood ending grafted onto it that the original didn't. And it was a crap movie as a result. I can only guess that Sluizer was paid a s**t load of money for the rights to his original classic on condition that he totally wreck the end of the remake.I liked ""Buried"" very much and it's gone straight into my list of movies that I'll be happy to watch regularly.JMV",Buried

142,Caps Fan,Stunning,7,30 November 2011,"When I heard that they were making a film about an American trucker who wakes up to find himself kidnapped, buried, alone, and having only 90 minutes to live, with (Canadian) Ryan Reynolds cast as the trucker, I must admit that both eyebrows went up. Isn't he too lightweight for this sort of thing?Well, as it turns out, no, he isn't. Reynolds turns in a strong, convincing, sympathetic performance as Paul Conroy, ""just a guy"" caught up in the chaotic mess of Iraq and being held for ransom. He knows this because his kidnappers tell him so over the BlackBerry they have thoughtfully provided. They also use it to show Conroy the ""execution"" of a female friend of his. He is told he will be left to die unless a ransom of $5 million, later reduced to a mere $1 million, is paid.Paul Conroy is the only character we see in person, but he uses the phone to interact with others as he urgently tries to reach someone who can save him. This puts him in touch with phone company employees (""No need to be rude, sir"", says one, mistaking Conroy's desperation for ill manners) the State Department (his contact there has a British accent - go figure!), and, in a memorably harsh and nauseatingly plausible exchange, with the HR Director of the company he worked for. Conroy is not the sharpest knife in the drawer (witness his repeated use of a lighter, which will, of course, use up the oxygen he is short of), but he didn't deserve that.As for the ending, well, what can I say? I thought they were doing one thing, hoped they were doing another, and they actually did a third thing, which was utterly and savagely effective. The last few seconds, and the pathetic last line, are stunning.The camera-work is surprisingly varied, given the small area we are watching. Music is fit for purpose.Recommended, unless you're claustrophobic or squeamish.Rating: 7/10",Buried

With such a small cast there was enough good acting to carry the film. RYAN REYNOLDS carried the whole film on his shoulders, and the film was very detailed, so it must have weighed a lot. As a watcher there a little things I look for to help me understand who I'm watching. I like to hear the who, where, what, when, why, and how of the main character. This really helps establish a good foundation to a film. Another really good quality to the film was the build up of tension. Most of the entire film happens in a tiny little coffin, but it is still manages to keep you fully engaged. The final thing that this film had was the ending. The final 5 minutes of the movie are by far the best. It gives you all you need, but nothing you want...CONS: The one poor part to this film was the plot holes. There was just enough problems in this film to not have an equal balance of answers. You couldn't really understand the motives of the other characters on a deeper level. For example, the ""bad guy"" was very poorly contrived, therefore he didn't hold as much weight as he should have.",Buried
147,benjaminwest-242,An intense story,7,21 October 2021,"Buried is a high stakes, emotional film. Reynolds' acting is great, showcasing an array of emotions justified for someone in his situation. The supporting cast of voice adds to his despair, enhancing the experience. The overall plot is well constructed, but does falter in some moments. A few developments don't make sense, but does not take away from the story too much. However, such a film simply doesn't have the capacity to fulfill what great movies have. The character development is slightly overshadowed by the situation Reynolds' character is in, making it somewhat lacking in that respect, exacerbated by not having other characters to delve into. Overall, a respectable film with a meaningful ending.",Buried
148,newblu,Peep This Reviews,7,9 July 2017,"Let me start by saying I'm not a huge fan of Ryan Rodney Reynolds. He typically comes off as undeservedly arrogant. Even ""Deadpool"", it was good but over rated and over hyped. So an hour and a half of him alone in a box certainly did not get my interest initially. All I can say is any expectations that I had were dead wrong. Rodrigo Cortes has made a movie that is literally a man in a box that you can't help but become invested in or stop watching.",Buried

The fact that we only see Ryan Reynolds on the screen mixed with a fact that the movie is extremely intense, makes it pretty inviting, don't you think? I think you do, and you have right. Buried is just so thrilling. I haven't seen such a good thriller for some time. I loved it, because it gave you several clues and directions where to head to, but in the end it really surprises you. It's very original movie. I highly recommend it for everyone who'd like to have something tasty for midnight movie. Oh, you get the feeling and you probably gonna like it too.Ryan Reynold's greatest performance by a clear mile. He shows something different and I think he has brought home an appreciation for that.

151,montera_iulian,"Buried could be describable as a claustrophobic suspense movie that sets a real time-clock to your patience, all said in a good way.",7,1 December 2010,"If you're trying to get away from a deadly trap chances to fail are incredibly high. If you're trying to breathe the same air that you ""burn"" you're seriously out of time. And if you're trying to make a phone call to your loved ones be sure that you'll hardly get them home. These are some so-called ""getaway theories"" that I noticed from watching this movie. None of them I consider to be fresh news though. But was that a problem for Buried?... It wasn't. Buried could be describable as a claustrophobic suspense movie that sets a real time-clock to your patience, all said in a good way. It's a good moisture of anxiety, pressure, regrets and confusing times. You'd be amazed of how many (important) things you could forget when time's keeping you under pressure, when your life is in danger and especially when you need to remember them. The things is ... when the anxiety passes and you're getting calmer, you will remember those things but then it will be too late. This pretty much sums up what this movie is about. It's about the reality and reality is usually harsh to us.The story is simple. It's about a U.S. contractor, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), who works in Iraq and after an attack by a group of iraqis he wakes to find he is buried alive inside a coffin. With just a lighter, a cell phone and few other useless things he finds himself in a race against time to escape from this deadly trap. I wished this would turn out to be a ""Hitchc*ckian"" structure of the story but it isn't. it is good but it has it's flaws in realism and logic at times although the ending is as real as it could be and that is a great aspect of this film. All the film is shot inside the coffin so don't expect anyone else in the movie besides our main character Paul. There is suspense, there is interest in the denouement but it kinda looses it's charm right at the end but the little ""twist"" in the end reinvigorates the atmosphere.The casting of Ryan Reynolds was good. I like this actor, I think he has a great potential and he just needs to work harder because there is the talent and this movie proved it. His performance as the scared and anxious contractor is touching but nothing the Academy would look for. I needed to mention this just because I saw a lot of positive reviews that were overpraising his portrayal which to me is a little bit extreme.Technically I don't agree with few things. The movie was shot inside the coffin all the time and I understand that but why did some shots had to deliver something impossible to be seen. Sometimes the camera moved up and down too much or there is this specific scene in which the camera rises and rises through the top of the coffin and it doesn't stop. Now, I know that the director wanted to offer the audience a feeling of depth but that didn't fit, in my opinion, the claustrophobic atmosphere in this movie and it kinda ruined it. I hoped for real dramatic shots inside that coffin. I wanted to feel the pressure and the dizziness. I wanted to feel frightened from a place like that but those shots ruined the most important technical aspect of this movie. The score was pretty good though it wasn't necessary for them to make one so I didn't quite paid attention to it that much.On a short note, Buried is that film which is good but it won't get it's second viewing from the usual movie fan. It's a film I recommend to anyone who likes these kind of atmospheric and thrilling movie. It's an interesting experience which you may enjoy but it's not a movie for the narrow-minded since it will mostly become too dull or boring to them. Hope you enjoyed reading my review and here are the usual ratings for this mysterious film.",Buried
152,the_rattlesnake25,"Taut, suspenseful, and effective.",8,2 October 2010,"It'd be somewhat of a travesty if Ryan Reynolds does not get acknowledged during the awards season for his brilliant and heart-rending portrayal of a father who wakes up and finds that he himself has been buried alive. Going into 'Buried,' the less the audience knows about the plot details of the film, the more it will enhance their enjoyment of the proceeding ninety minutes of cinematic screen time. Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is a truck driver in Iraq who wakes up to find that he is buried alive. Who, why, where, and when, are all questions that are systematically explained throughout the course of the film. But, while the audience's attention may hinge at times on the development of the narrative, it is the inventiveness of Cortes and the heart-felt performance by Reynolds that keeps the tension and the suspense of the film at a constant high throughout providing one of the best thrillers to see a theatrical release in years.Cortes takes the minimalist, one-room concept to new heights as he provides only the confines of a basic coffin for the setting of a film. Continually providing diverse camera angles to explore the tiny locational hotspot, while differentiating from close-up to medium shots, allows the audience to be drawn into Conroy's horrifying situation and encounter each obstacle with the character himself. The lighting of the setting is also meticulously used to create mood and experience, Conroy is trapped within six panels of wood, and natural light is nowhere to be seen, so his use of artificial light is key his changing emotions and the narrative itself. And changing emotions is an understatement; Anger, sadness, surprise, fear, contempt, aggression, and submission, all develop and explode from under the surface of Conroy as he attempts to challenge one of man's greatest mysteries; understanding the unknown. Reynolds gives quite possibly the performance of his career as he literally providing one-man-cinematic show, while his passionately explosive show-piece alongside the beautifully simplistic cinematography, editing and lighting create a film that keeps audiences on the edge of their seat for its entire duration.'Buried' is an ambitious project, pulled off by an enthusiastic director which breathes a little life into the mystery thriller genre in general. Cortes and Reynolds essentially provide a two-man show that would eclipse most big-budget thrillers by simply sticking to an effective script, concept and performance. It does have its technological flaws, but if you can look past those ever-so-slightly unrealistic aspects, then 'Buried' is an incredibly enjoyable suspense-fuelled ride beyond the grave.",Buried

I recorded this on the spur of the moment. A few weeks ago. I never got round to watching it until last night and I'm glad I did.There are so many films out there that are carbon copies of each other and you can almost predict what is going to happen. But 'Buried' is as unpredictable as it is unnerving. This really shouldn't work. The whole movie is set inside a coffin in the middle of some desert in the middle east. It only has one visible actor and several voice actors. The movie shouldn't work but it does. Mainly because of a fantastic script and a deliciously macabre plot.It keeps you on the edge of your sofa all the way and builds up to a terrific climax.

They complain about the ending, they complain about it being shot from within a coffin. So what!?!?!?!! That's what makes it originally and suspenseful.

156,Marc_Action,Brake With Stephen Dorff Has Made Me a Bit Biased,5,22 July 2017,"I already saw Brake a couple years back (I also have a review for that film), and had decided I would see Buried due to all the comparisons in the reviews. I'm just finally getting around to seeing Buried, as I just wasn't in the mood to see another similar movie as Brake, even though I enjoyed it. Well, I can say that after the long wait, I am a bit underwhelmed with Buried starring Ryan Reynolds. If you don't know by now, Buried is a movie filmed entirely within a wooden coffin, where our only visible character for 94 of its 95 minutes, is Reynolds as Paul Conroy--a truck driver for a US contractor in Iraq. His convoy of trucks gets ambushed and he's placed in this claustrophobic prison/deathtrap for ransom. The movie picks up at this point (where he's already been buried alive) and the camera and story stay fixed on Reynold's confined, dire predicament until the very end. I think Reynolds did an excellent job acting and carries the film because, well, he has no choice, as again, he's pretty much the only visible character. Had the acting been lousy, this film would have probably been one of the worst films of all time. That said, Buried just wasn't that great overall. Maybe I'm biased because having seen Brake first, I found the latter movie to be much more entertaining and better executed. While Buried certainly had an interesting concept of filming an entire movie from an enclosed space with one character, I just found it all to be a bit boring. For one thing, we get that it's a tight, enclosed space, but the shots were often too dark to see what our main character was doing. Couple that with the fact that all the dialogue was done totally via cell phone from only Paul's perspective. It all combines to form a movie very hard to follow at times, so much so that I had to actually pull up the plot summary on Wikipedia to figure out what had just happened in some instances. On top of that, there were a few implausible aspects of the film that almost made Buried unwatchable. For instance, was that a magic coffin with magical oxygen? Not only would Paul have likely died or been unconscienced waaaaaay before the end of the movie, but this fool actually continued to use a lighter while buried in the coffin with already limited oxygen. This movie almost made me feel stupid. I kept thinking to myself, ""Did I miss something in elementary school?"" ""Weren't we taught as kids that fire needs oxygen to burn?"" So, why did our main character continue to burn that lighter (and thus his oxygen supply) when there was other light sources that didn't require sacrificing his oxygen? Then he starts a fire later on to kill a rattle snake that mysteriously appears. Why? He would have stood a better chance trying to stump and squish the snake to death with his heavy boots than survive a fire and the ensuing smoke. The smoke never materialized BTW, because, you know, these are magical Hollywood fires. Another irritating thing was the way Paul's employer tried to get out of its responsibility for paying out benefits in the event he died. Not that a company wouldn't be this dishonest in real life, but the manner in which it was portrayed in the movie was just plain dumb. Paul's company knew the fate of the convoy and knew of Paul's current situation but for whatever reason still decided it was a great idea to actually call him while he was buried alive by terrorists to reprimand him for inappropriate behavior and to tell Paul they had actually fired him earlier that day. They also made sure to let him know they were recording the conversation, as if to cover their on asses. Well, the PR nightmare alone this company would face if they ever tried to use that tape as evidence in a case would cost them more to clean up than to just quietly pay his widow a pension or something. Plus, if they really did fire Paul earlier that day, then someone obviously forgot to tell him or the supervisors in Iraq prior to the start of his shift because, well, the poor guy was in that damn box in the first place because he was ""at work"" when the company's convoy of trucks got ambushed—which makes the entire phone call and recording useless. Sheesh, if the company is this incompetent when trying to cover its ass, one has to wonder how great their security was for the convoy in the first place. Anyway, I can see why some viewers would really like this movie. It's very unorthodox in its singular setting, surprise ending, and limited cinematography, special effects, and characters. But for me, being filmed in only one dark location with virtually one visible character for all but one minute, and a lousy script, did not bode well for Buried. It gets a mediocre score of 5.",Buried
157,Gerardrobertson61,Suspenseful,6,21 March 2014,"When this movie started and the opening credits began, it was in parallel with Hitchcock movies, almost a replica of the Psycho opening sequence. It was fairly obvious that the director has been inspired by the Master of Macabre.I was intrigued for the entire 90 minutes of the movie, and although there were a couple of scenes that I was unsure about, it was still well worth watching. Ryan Reynolds is believable as a man buried alive in a coffin, and you can really feel the emotions he experiences during the movie. There is some wonderful conversations he has on the phone, in particular when he speaks to his mother.Just as you think that nothing more can happen, a surprise twist occurs which makes you want to stay and see if he will or will not survive.

163,intern-88,Don't let a war ruin your movie,4,22 June 2012,"'Don't let a mobile phone ruin your movie.'It seems that those ironic cynics at Orange, producers of the anti- marketing marketing filmlets that preface virtually every British cinema release, missed a trick with the Rodrigo Cortes-directed taphephobic thriller, Buried. For what is normally a pain in the narrative for the modern thriller, where the peril of the protagonist is undermined somewhat by the fact of help only being a touch-screen away, is an indispensable plot mechanism in Buried.The reason for that – as the pre-release hype, not to mention the title, intimates - is that Buried is set entirely in a coffin. It features just one visible actor: Ryan Reynolds. So unless you're currently pining for an alternate 1980s version of Buried, in which we get to watch a Hollywood sort-of-star slowly asphyxiate for no apparent reason, then you'll be glad of that incessant buzzing and pinging of a mobile phone. It doesn't ruin the movie; it makes it. That and the zippo lighter.Although not quite up there with Krapp's Last Tape, Buried is a drama conjured up from the barest of elements, the most meagre of resources. During the opening couple of minutes it's as if the Spanish director is just bringing the component parts of the story together. Look, it says, out of nothing, something. In the beginning there was blackness, and then, suddenly, we hear the sound of breathing. Human breathing. Then the thumping starts, an indication that there is a solid world out there, in the dark. And then, at last, there was light. And now a face, a body, in a wooden coffin.That is the premise. A man, whom we later come to know as American truck driver Paul Conroy, wakes up entombed, and he knows not why. He scrabbles about a bit. There's a bit of histrionics. And then with the discovery of a mobile phone, the drama starts. Because it's only through the various fraught, frustrated conversations that we learn a bit about Paul Conroy, what he does, what happened, and, to a lesser extent, what sort of man he is. And it's also only through that phone that there is any hope of resurrection.There's no doubting the film's central achievement: to do so much with so little. Cortes seems to revel in the pacing of the narrative, of deciding precisely when to give the drama some propulsion and when to let it flag, when to let the audience hope, and when to let us despair. At points it almost feels like an experiment, an examination of the nature of narrative suspense, of what makes us tick, as much as showing us what makes Conroy tick. Although one cynical move, which gives a new meaning to the phrase trouser snake, does suggest an exhaustion of dramatic ideas rather than their fruition.More effective is the claustrophobic setting, aided and abetted by the up-close-and-personal camera work. Not in the visceral sense of 'oh, that's what it would be like to be buried alive', or even 'doesn't Reynolds have thick bristles?', but again in the dramatic sense. Conroy's isolated, impotent situation is ours, the audience's; and his partial, inadequate viewpoint is all that we have to go on. We yearn for some other perspective, some viewpoint that might literally shed light on the darkened proceedings. And it's this prospect that drags us on, that is as vital to us looking for a point as it is to the character looking for a rescue.Yet if this claustrophobic perspective, this frustrating limit to our knowledge, does seem to open up space for a more interesting film, this space is quickly filled by a really clumsy commentary on the Iraq War. It's this that ruins Buried, not a mobile phone. It removes a certain depth to Buried, digging for it instead a very shallow interpretative grave.Conroy, we learn, is a truck driver working in Iraq on behalf of an American contractor. As we discover, the bad guys here aren't so much the kidnappers – despite their predilection for YouTube beheadings – as the Coalition of the Willing and Conroy's smarmy employers, both of whom combine bureaucratic indifference with legal slipperiness and sheer disingenuousness. Their willingness to evade responsibility for Conroy becomes all too achingly metaphorical. His mess is Iraq's, too. A mess better buried than confronted.Which for anyone as unmoved by Reynold's performance as I was does have its benefits. Shouty-angry – and yes voicemail can be annoying – is never going to ingratiate you to any would-be rescuers. Nor will it win you sympathy from an audience, unless brattish prattishness in a confined space is your thing. And the occasional lapses into frat-boy wiseacre mode seem to come from a supercilious place closer, perhaps, to Reynolds, than to a man buried alive somewhere in Iraq.",Buried

1. People who enjoyed the film
2. Bigots who use their review to insult Americans and boast how easy it would have been for them to escape the box. The man had anxiety issues. Even the most calm person would have been going just as nuts in that box as he was. If you haven't been through such a situation, you are ridiculous for thinking you know exactly how you would handle it. You can't just dig your way out of a box with a little pocket knife. You saw how hard he was trying to break the wood, which speaks as to how deep he was. All he needed to be was a foot or so deeper underground than the box was tall, and he would have suffocated and been covered in sand as soon as he tried to break free. You know, the EXACT same thing that we saw happen when the box DID break open. Sand would not only come in from directly above the box, but flow in from the sides. Breaking the box doesn't just magically let you ""doggie paddle"" through the sand like one genius review said. It's well over 100 degrees where he was, and could have been as high as 120 . He was in a tiny box with very little oxygen and was sweating like crazy. He would have been dehydrated severely on top of his bad anxiety. He was probably in the box two hours before he even woke up, and likely had a head injury or was drugged. Why else would he just ""wake up"" in a box? I saw someone claim the flask was filled with water at the beginning, yet was suddenly ""petrol"" when he tried to burn the snake. No, it was a flask...you know...of ALCOHOL. And this same reviewer was insulting Americans...typical of a bigot I guess. IMDB does a very poor job at policing these reviews. If you don't hate Americans and can accept the fact that this is a MOVIE, not a guide as to how to survive if you wake up in a box...you will probably enjoy this.

169,sharkattack1978,Being BURIED alive will become your greatest nightmare,9,6 February 2011,"Now I know what you are thinking, is this film worth my time and money. YES it is. This is a well acted, fairly well thought out thriller that will make you hold your breath from the intensity of the subject matter. It is terrifyingly real and everything the principal character feels, you will be made to feel right up to the last second where the last twist will shock you and stay with you long after the credits have rolled. Ryan Reynolds has always been one of my fave actors since he was in Van Wilder and the Amityville horror. Reynolds has proved that he can do both comedy and drama and here he does keep you on the edge of your seat for 90 mins. The films running time actually mirrors the time that Reynolds character is subjected to during his ordeal under the ground. Reynolds is the core of this film as the whole film is of him and no-one else. The film is a well crafted piece of suspense and even if you think you already know the ending, how it is executed stays with you even after the film ends. Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, a track driver of a company called CRT. After an ambush in the Iraqi wastelands, his whole convoy is killed and he is held alive but under the Iraqi desert in a wooden box that could easily become his tomb. With only a lighter, a mobile phone which is rapidly losing battery and a flask of brandy, Paul realises he must keep his wits about him to escape this nightmare where time is rapidly running out.WARNING THIS NEXT PART CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!! Now if you were put in a wooden box and buried several feet under the Iraqi desert and you were running out of not only air but battery, what would you do? Well for a start, you try not to panic as the franticness of the situation would make you lose more air than if you were calm. However how can you stay calm stuck halfway under the ground. Paul only has a handful of numbers to call while in the coffin but this is supposed to be emergency services, yet none of them really give a crap that he is placed in a Stupid coffin miles from nowhere. The voice acting on the other end of Paul's are superb and helps pull you further into Paul's nightmare and succeeds to force you into the same frustration that Paul finds himself on the receiving end of. Now a lot of people (especially on IMDb.com) that criticise Paul manner while he speaks to these people while to the coffin. His anguish and abuse is understandable in this situation. If you were stuck in the ground, wouldn't you be cheesed off? Paul does have this trait but it doesn't spoil the sympathy that you feel for his character throughout the movie. Top that with the fact that his company couldn't give a crap about him which is revealed in a phone call with the chief of personnel at Paul's place of work and also to find out that the person who is supposed to be helping him is bloody lying to him the whole time, adds to the anguish that Paul and the audience feels as the movie comes to its climax. and just having someone saying ""I'm sorry"" as you feel like your life is slipping away just fuels it more. By the end of the movie I was thinking that if I had been Paul and I had of got out of there, that jerk at CRT would have been my first port of call and had the crap kicked out of him for what he done. By the end I was annoyed by the way it ended, it seemed like Paul finally accepted his fate. just when you think he is being rescued, a nasty curve-ball comes along to deliver that last shocking blow to your and Paul's senses. However now looking back, the ending does work as it leaves an emotional scar in your mind and even at some point haunts you as you know that in Iraq, things like this ACTUALLY happen and people disappear and we have no idea where they are. Buried is a terrifying thriller that I'm sure you will be talking about for days afterwards. This is a captivating movie and it is EVIL in its execution but Buried is a film that cannot be ignored.",Buried
170,bharath-karthikeyan,Buried makes you breathless!,6,13 March 2011,"The movie is supposed to have been filmed in Barcelona,But all the audience get to watch is the 2 by 8 coffin with Ryan Reynolds(Paul) gasping for breath throughout the run length! 'Buried' is a psychological thriller and the USP here is it gets real and practical at few times.The movie opens up with Paul inside a coffin gasping for breath.The audience are left guessing with who could have planned this coffin trap and what their intentions could have been.Inside a coffin there is a mobile which has operator service to call,a knife,enough portable lights.Presence of all this makes the audience take up numerous assumptions on how the movie would end and what the movie is all about.But at most parts the movie throws up something new for the audience to ponder.The first few minutes might be tedious to watch,but the movie progresses well from the middle till the end.The background score keeps the movie going as it is really tough to make the audience sit for 90 minutes listening to breathlessness!The movie like a last lecture gives enough thoughtful stuffs for people to consider when they get faced with such life threatening situations.There is a mixture of Love,anger,grief, excitement and the best part is it is all captured within the coffin!Ryan Reynolds has done a very good job and this definitely is a milestone in his career.Voice-overs are done well and pretty much the casting is done well but mediocre.The plot losses the edge at times,becomes lose and repetitive.The first half of the movie can get tedious to watch.The Editing needs some improvement here.So if you still have not watched the movie, you can rather wait for some director's or critic's cut when it comes out on home formats!Decent effort...worth a watch :)",Buried
171,suvopyne49,Nice Attempt- but has flaws,8,16 February 2011,"Watched 2 similar kind of movies in one day. The comparison with 127 hours is expected. But somewhat it fells short to become a great movie. The movie starts well with showing Paul (Ryan Reynolds) inside a coffin and the entire movie is, let's just say ""contained"" in the coffin. The plot is set upon war-hit Iraq, where a American truck driver, Paul, finds himself buried with a blackberry, a lighter and stuff. The movie then takes turns as Paul receives call from his ""kidnappers"" who asked him to shoot a ransom video. Meanwhile Paul contacts with US military, FBI and everyone who could rescue him from that situation.The Movie has only one actor, literally, so entire performance Ryan Reynolds. To be fair to him, he does well. But the movie though well shot with some great camera angles and manages to grip the attention, has some drawbacks. It's astounding that Paul, after finding a knife, don't use that as a last resort to break free from there. We can imagine that all of these attempts of getting rescued is imagined (unlike 127 hours which is based on a true story), the movie doesn't really shows the measure of attempt a man can do to survive. Even the ending is a little predictable after the last phone call. All we can say it's a good attempt.",Buried
172,burgif,Yawn,2,15 January 2011,"Alfred Hitchcock did a one hour episode titled ""Final Escape"" that dealt with almost similar topic (being buried alive) however Hitchcock work was a masterpiece and unforgettable unlike this movie. I know it is unfair to compare the work of the great Hitchcock to Rodrigo Cortés or anyone else but it is a fair I guess to compare a TV series episode to a movie. This movie only succeeded in portraying the government bureaucracy in dealing with a citizen livelihood or at least that what I manage to remember of this movie otherwise everything else like the Iraq war, contractors, terrorists and ransom are just clichés. This movie is watchable but I hardly think its an Oscar material.",Buried
173,paq5528,Virtual Claustrophobia!,9,21 December 2010,"This was one of the best movies I've ever seen where the whole script is played out by a single actor in a confined space. You would almost think that it would become boring -- how could someone make a movie interesting when the movement is confined to a small box and you only ever see one actor? The strength of the movie is in its ability to draw you into that same box, make Paul's fear yours, allow your imagination to share the same confines and let the horror of the situation visit your own deepest fears. From the opening scene, you feel enveloped in the same darkness as the protagonist. You feel confined. You gulp for air, for light... You imagine waking in complete darkness, trapped, with the subtle and growing realization that it is not just being confined, but buried! It makes my heart race as I think about it even now.I recommended this movie to a colleague who hadn't heard of it and asked about the plot. The title gives you a great starting point for discussion without giving anything about the movie away, and the way the director builds the suspense, the frustration, the desperation is palpable, contagious...The context of the movie was solid, the emotions tangible. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.",Buried

Seriously, this movie gave me nightmares.It was very well-filmed. I mean, excellent visuals of what is basically... the inside of a box. And Reynolds' acting is top-notch here. If this were not ""just a horror flick,"" it would certainly have earned some Oscar nominations for acting, directing, editing.There were times I asked myself, ""What else can they do to make the inside of a box interesting?"" And the movie always had an answer, shaking things up, surprising me with visual tricks.Great story, great acting and directing, wonderful editing, and the ever-elusive skillful TIMING in a story where timing is everything. This film takes what appears to be very little and turns it into a roller-coaster ride of panic.I highly recommend.PS: Three days later I watched ""127 Hours.""

175,orourkec-292-269155,"Enjoyable to watch, even if it isn't powerful.",7,10 October 2014,"I enjoyed watching Buried, even though I was disappointed and sad in not experiencing toward Buried a strong feeling of anxiety, fear, depression and breath running out of me. I didn't feel heart-pounded by this movie, nor did I think the movie was great and truly irresistible. The movie did make me a tiny bit anxious a few times during the watch though, and that's one thing, but not as much as I would have expected of course. One of the things I admired in Buried was its twists. I didn't expect most or any of these twists, but when I say I didn't expect them I actually mean to say that I completely didn't expect them. These twists are great and they will blow your mind. Believe me, you won't see them coming. When it comes to Ryan Reynolds, I think that his performance was unusually impressive and a performance worth remembering for at least a decade to come. I also like the fact that Ryan Reynolds's character is trying to get help in order to escape from the claustrophobic trap in which he is imprisoned, by calling on a phone he has with him, but as the movie continues on, Ryan Reynolds' character, instead, begins getting a call telling him of an inappropriate and illegal action from his own part inside his job, and that therefore, the people calling him and the people that have been trying to rescue him from the beginning, will not try to rescue him anymore and will leave him to his fate. I like it, because it adds more dramatic conflict --and originality-- to the plot. Other good things with this film include the fact that the movie starts right off the bat with Reynold's character having already been buried alive underground (someplace we don't know), rather than starting the film with what happened that led to his underground burial, because it makes the film more mysterious that way (and an efficient way to start a film as well), plus making Reynolds die at the end of the movie (through a surprising twist), rather than make him live in order to trick the audience's wish that he'll live, which is of course, artistic filmmaking. My rating for the movie is 7.0/10",Buried

Once you see Ryan Reynolds in the coffin you feel like you are there with him and it's horrifying. Ryan Reynolds's performance is great, showing how a man would probably really react to being stuck in a coffin. The story is mysterious and interesting and you just wish the camera would leave the coffin so you'd know whats going on. This movie makes you sweat, claustrophobic, it makes your heart beat. Overall an excellent film, that becomes an experience.",Buried
177,DemiRonin,A suffocatingly well executed idea which surprisingly has a lot more to offer than you might think.,8,15 April 2011,"A suffocatingly well executed idea which surprisingly has a lot more to offer than you might think. The film is just as the title leads you to believe, Ryan Reynolds wakes up one moment and realizes he's been buried alive! Reynolds plays Paul Conroy a truck driver who's been contracted to ""rebuild Iraq"" (of course after we've invaded and destroyed it). Awakening imprisoned Paul does what everyone would do, screams as loud as he can for help and tries and force his way out. However the obvious solutions prove to be futile so armed with a flashlight, a lighter and a Blackberry Paul must escape or be witness to his own one man funeral. Latter, we come to know the reason for Paul's imprisonment is that he's being held captive for the sum of one million dollars, which if not transfered to a certain bank account he will be left to die. Paul calls everyone he can think of including family friends, the government and his company to prevent him from dying five feet under the ground trapped in a box. What can Paul do to satisfy his kidnappers and who can he call to get him out!? We'll you're going to have to watch the movie to find out. This film never leaves the box which is an amazing feat for a film. It stays underground and doesn't leave for surreal dream or fantasy moments like 127 Hours, which in my mind makes it a better film. Now you can debate this for hours on end but for me, putting the parameters of ""We are going to make a film about someone being trapped, and we are never going to cheat by leaving the space of the character"" is something to be praised for if done correctly. Buried delivers a story that few would try to attempt and manages to not only keep your audience interested in suspense but also brings up some very controversial topics about government, power and truth. The sound design in this film is amazing and the variety of shots this film pulls off with such a small space should make all cinematographers take notes. Ryan's performance is pitch perfect as you see his character ride a roller coaster of emotions of panicked, hopeful, and defeated. Even though you may hate the sound of this movie, that is exactly why you must see it. *spoiler alert If not for the ending this film would have only gotten a 7/10. But the ending has a twist at the end (which i didn't see coming) that packs a wallop of truth down your throat. For making the strong choice and not going Hollywood I gotta give it another point. Well deserved.",Buried
178,R-P-McMurphy,"Oh man, I haven't seen a thriller so breathtaking as ""Buried"" in some time now.",9,19 August 2013,"Oh man, I haven't seen a thriller so breathtaking as ""Buried"" in some time now.An American truck driver, working in Iraq, is trapped inside of a coffin underground with a cellphone, a zippo, a flask, and a few other things looking to find a way out before his time runs out.I still remember people ranting in the movie theater once the movie ended the first time I went to see it, all the while I held a big smile on my face, I felt heartbroken, but in a good way. The movie didn't only succeed in a technical level, I also felt genuinely scared by it and couldn't wait to tell all my friends to see it to have them feel the same.The screen writing is just incredible, with the way it starts with a seemingly effortless plot and ends up expanding the story without really going anywhere. It's similar in a way to the TV series ""Lost"", with people stuck on an island, yet the writers kept on adding so much to what first seemed like a simple story, the only difference is that ""Lost"" was surrealistic and made great use of flashbacks, while ""Buried"" is realistic and doesn't cheat by showing us the protagonist's past, giving us the feeling that we're stuck in the coffin with him.It's also safe to say that the movie, unlike other horror movies, does hold up to repeat viewings. I felt just as tense watching it this time as I did when I first saw it. The visuals were pretty good for a movie taking place in a coffin. I could feel Paul's (Ryan Reynolds) hope for survival and at other times I could also feel his hopelessness.I recognized a few different things by watching it again, like how good Ryan Reynolds was in this carrying the whole film by himself, and apart from that I realized the real meaning of the film and the themes it's actually dealing with. Something tells me that deep in its core, this isn't just an above average suspense movie. What I mean is that, metaphorically speaking, ""Buried"" is just an anti-Iraq war movie as ""Green Zone"" or ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" like Martin Scorsese's short ""The Big Shave"" was about his feelings against the Vietnam war. I don't know if this is what director Rodrigo Cortes intended to do with his debut feature, but it was what I interpreted after rewatching it this time.I'd recommend it to anyone in the mood for a gripping thriller, specially anyone who liked ""Panic Room"", ""Saw"", ""The Call"", ""The Vanishing"", ""Rope"", ""Platoon"", and/or ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2""",Buried

180,rob-broekhof-1,Intriguing,8,14 August 2013,"On one hand this story/movie is brilliant. A man in a box under the ground, held hostage for ransom, nothing more and  nothing less! Especially the ""nothing less"" is surprising, and that makes it brilliant. On the other hand, to me it contains some parts that are at the verge of sentimentality and incredibility. Still, I consider it to be a good one! The choice for Ryan Reynolds also surprised me. It made me watch the movie. Considering how they usually typecast him, I was really curious how he would perform in a story like this. According to me he did a GREAT job! He was very credible. The incredibility of this movie was only due to some parts of the story. To me Ryan really represented ""the ordinary guy who gets trapped and tries to cope and to find a way out"". Some people described the character of ""the ordinary guy"" as very stupid, BUT I'd say: ""What would your behavior be in a situation like that?!"". Guess that in such a situation, that would drive anyone insane, the probability that someone would act irrational is pretty big. The sentence ""Paul must rely on his best resource—himself"", in the storyline written by Jim Beaver on IMDb also made me watch the movie. During the movie it became horribly clear to me that no one could (and even would) help him. After the movie it dawned on me how he had been relying on himself. What really struck my mind was how awful something wonderful as a smart phone can be applied; extremely mean spirited people who come up with such an idea! Finally: how a narrow space in a box can become someone's world, and how this box is somewhere in a world that is so incredibly large, that as it turns out, it's impossible to find it. Imagine that it's not ""your body in a box"", but ""your mind in your body"" which causes this extreme level of anxiety.",Buried

182,theworstcritic,Surprising Masterpiece,10,25 March 2021,"This movie really took me by surprise. I had seen other 'stuck' movies such as phonebooth and 127 hours but they lack the thrill this movie creates. The greatest difference is the location. Having someone in a coffin is a genius idea as the confinement helps a lot with tension and suspense. The lighting and tight, close up shots really help this film, giving the viewer an immersive, claustrophobic feeling that I've never experience from a film before.
Ryan Reynolds was also a surprise as his acting was phenomenal. After watching it I realised I spent 90 minutes watching only him in a tiny box, and was engaged the whole time.
The movie does have some issues with the length. It seems they tried to extend it as much as possible to get an average 90 minute movie by adding random, unnecessary scenes(there's mainly 1 bad scene with some hiccups now and then). If the movie was 10-15 minutes shorter it could have been better.
This is a very original film that was executed extremely well so I don't really understand the 7/10 score it has. Almost every scene from start to end was engaging and it ends perfectly. Truly a brilliant, unique thriller",Buried
183,CasualFnSViewer,"Buried is a film that runs on adrenaline and tension to keep viewers engaged. Like it or hate it, it offers something that most films don't.",7,31 December 2020,"Armed only with a lighter, cellphone, and a few other materials left at his disposal, Paul (Ryan Reynolds) must find a way out of his situation before time runs out. The focus of the entire movie revolves only in Paul's situation and does not leave his coffin for the entire duration of the film. The lack of variety it offers places an emphasis on maintaining the momentum of the high stakes situation, meaning that the tension must be present all throughout and build more information on Paul's circumstances while he is buried underground.Is it worth watching? You can take it or leave it. Some viewers may find it a bore with the amount of space (limiting the movement) and things Paul has to work with given the situation. On the other hand, those who are curious with how the situation develops given the premise, especially those with a sense of claustrophobia, will likely keep them engaged for the entire duration of the film.There was a slight visual inconsistency that I saw that lasted for a second, but other than that, given the limited space there was to work with, the cinematography was quite impressive. Paul's determination will leave you wondering if it was all worth it, and it is what keeps your attention until the very last second of the film where it is answered.",Buried
184,klesker,Outstanding,9,4 October 2010,"If this doesn't remain in my top five come year-end I will be shocked. Who thought that a movie can not only sustain a full 90mins stuck within the confines of a coffin (and believe me, it doesn't leave the coffin) but that it would be one of the most cinematic and audacious pieces of cinema I've seen in a good few years? Like this year's Inception and Toy Story 3, movies like Buried are the reason I love cinema. It is escapism at it's best, ironic considering the setting. Who thought Ryan Reynolds, Van Wilder: Party Liaison himself could be so utterly mesmerising in such a challenging role? The movie is literally his. Sure, there are those he speaks to over the phone (he's buried with a Zippo and a Blackberry) but for the film's length, he is the only physical presence on screen. He goes through every emotion possible: fear, panic, anger, sadness, happiness, depression, acceptance, and all of it played so convincingly that you almost wonder whether they genuinely buried the actor and left a camera in there with him.There are minor gripes, all predominantly found in the first half. It feels somewhat episodic at times and there's a lack of any real tension during the first forty minutes but this is a pressure cooker of a film and the last half is unrelenting to the point of nausea, culminating in a truly great finale that caused me to shout-out in the quiet, near empty cinema.Buried is extraordinary. The only performance to beat Reynolds' in recent years is Sam Rockwell's stunning turn in Moon. High concept thrillers like this rise or fall on the delivery of their challenging set ups. Fortunately, Buried works.It really, really works.",Buried

I want to root for the fellow all through this trials and see him get his reward for all he did to save himself.When we read a novel or watch a film, we relate to the protagonist.

186,Ben_Horror,Hitchcock is alive and well!,10,2 November 2010,"Remember the bit in the James Bond movie 'Diamonds are Forever' where Sean Connery wakes up to find himself locked in a coffin about to be incinerated? Or the bit in 'The Vanishing' where a character wakes up to find he's been buried alive? That's exactly what 'Buried' is; except it's what should be a small moment in another movie stretched to feature running time. That might not seem like a good idea at the first... After all, how many times have we heard of short films being extended to feature length that should probably have remained short films? What hope can there be for a single scene being stretched out to ninety-five minutes? Can it work? You'd naturally assume it shouldn't But strangely it does. For a movie set entirely in a wooden box, Buried works rather well.The film could be a lesson taken from the 'Alfred Hitchcock School of Suspense Filmmaking' where a single location is utilized with a limited cast. Further proof of this can even be seen in the opening titles and music which are so Hitchcockian in tone, you could almost imagine them being plucked from 1960s Cary Grant film. A man called Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) wakes up to discover he's been sealed inside a wooden box/coffin and buried alive in what we soon discover to be Iraq. He quickly locates a mobile phone that has been placed in the coffin with him and sets about trying to notify the authorities of his terrifying predicament while simultaneously negotiating with the shadowy personnel who put him there in the first place. With his oxygen running low, it's desperate a race against timeYears ago if someone had said it was possible to make an entire movie set in a box with only one character, most people would probably have laughed at them. And rightly so: how exactly do you make a movie set in a box with only one actor? It's impossible, right? Wrong. Director Rodrigo Cortés and writer Chris Sparling have done it: they have achieved what you'd outwardly assume to be impossible. In fact, that is movie is so entertaining at all is a huge achievement seen as it represents everything that so-called 'gurus' like Robert Mckee would probably rally against. It throws the rulebook out the window and tries to do something different.Movies like this have been attempted before of course – Phone Booth, for example - but they usually cut to different locations at some point and have other cast members coming and going throughout the scenes. Not so here. This is a lesson in claustrophobia where one man is about as much cast you're going to get. It really shouldn't work, but it does tenfold. Ryan Reynolds is really good in this, giving lots of dramatic weight to his role. He really deserves plaudits for attaching himself to such a project, which even if you ignore the financial limitations, must have surely been a strange experience that would have inevitably left a bad taste for a long time. There are moments when he's still on 'Planet Ryan' of course, but for the most part he turns in an intense and completely convincing character. He's easily identifiable as this 'blue-collar Joe' caught up in a situation where no one apparently gives a crap about his predicament. Unfortunately that's where the movie goes into strange political territory, but more on that later.This is real 'kitchen sink filmmaking' of the highest order because writer Chris Sparling - clearly aware of the potential limitations of his story - throws everything but the aforementioned domestic appliance into the mix for the sake of an entertaining show. He keeps it moving at a fast pace, even finding time for a bit of Indiana Jones-type slithery tomfoolery!Plaudits must also go to Rodrigo Cortés. He's a great director and he proves his metal here. A lot of directors would be out of their depth making a movie like this (go stand in the corner, Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay) and would probably be feeling very limited and restricted by its scope. Cortés, however, seems to thrive on it, pulling out every trick in his little book on directing to create something that has a lot of variety and depth when you would actually be expecting the exact opposite. It will be very interesting to see what projects he attaches himself to. On the strength of this, he could turn out to be one of the best directors out there.Now there is a political slant. And the movie works fine with it, but one can't help but wonder if it would have been so much better without it. The film would probably have been more effective as a straight-up, full-on suspense horror movie - aka Saw - where the buried protagonist is being menaced by an unseen presence for reasons not readily apparent. But the moment the filmmakers throw Iraq into the mix and all the uncomfortable connotations that goes along with it, it takes the movie out of its comfort zone and places it into a political allegory for the failures of the war, i.e., the people on the ground are the last priority for those managing any conflict. While admirable, we don't need such overtures in what should be a simple popcorn suspense movie.But that's a just small aside in a movie that does pretty much everything else brilliantly. The limitations of its setting actually turn out to be its greatest strengths: it should be boring, but it isn't; it shouldn't even be riveting, but it is. This is a great movie and Hollywood producers could learn a thing or two from it. It's very claustrophobic and if you suffer from nerves, probably not for you. But for the rest of us, though, it's a dark, bold and imaginative piece of exciting movie-making – a superior example of filmmakers 'thinking outside the box'. Pun intended.",Buried
187,FSfilmblog,Is it getting smaller in here...?,8,16 May 2011,"A man in a box. 90 minutes filled full of gripping and nail biting suspense. A claustrophobic inducing film and if you've never suffered from claustrophobia you may well feel like you do by the end of this film. Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is trapped in a box under ground. An average ordinary joe public who just happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. How, why and when he got there is eventually revealed through the clever use of a prop (the mobile phone). When he is informed by his captors that they intend on using him to extract money from the US government he has only till 9pm to succeed. A race against time with air running out and anxiety setting in.It's a physically exhausting journey as the action never strays away from the only character we see on screen. Ryan Reynolds gives an outstanding and mesmerizing performance of man trapped in a coffin with all manners of human emotion on display through the films tight ninety minutes. He starts out disorientated, frightened, angry, frustrated, helpless, resigned and then subsequently regains new hope. It's a dizzying array of emotions which we, as the viewer cannot help but feel sucked into.With extremely clever use of camera angles and placement, we never get a hint of it being set anywhere else but inside this coffin. Director Rodrigo Cortes has admirably allowed us to imagine the world on the outside from within the confined space, via conversations through a mobile the kidnappers have left for our protagonist to communicate to his own people to negotiate a deal for his whereabouts and release. The mobile phone, initially his one aid, the only hope in providing a contact with the outside world becomes almost a hindrance when he is put on hold at the point of reaching someone he feels may be able to help. Twisted and torturous in equal measures.The technical aspect is something which has to be applauded. With the use of lighting from a zippo lighter, mobile phone display screen to a torch, provide differences in tonal colour. Occasional blackouts and pull aways into blackness only adds to foreboding sense of hopelessness. Close ups and tracking shots within the confined setting are brilliantly used and very effective at conveying a sense of limited space.As the story progresses to it's logical conclusion, it's an amazing achievement at how much more suspense and dramatic turn, can come from just a man in a wooden box. When you think things can't get any worse for Paul, it can and it does. Does he make it out? You'll hope he does (and you'll have to watch it to find out) and when you do get to the end, if you are anything like me you will just want to get up,stretch out and breathe, as you will feel like you've been trapped in that damn coffin, short on breath and restricted by walls that seem to be closing in with every passing minute.....",Buried

Really a captivating film that is much more honest than most people will accept, as is shown in the box office result. If people wanted movies to think about, this would have been a box office smash! What a state the world must be in that such a film lost money. To say that Ryan was fantastic is an understatement. Exceptional acting. Rodrigo is right: Ryan IS Paul Conroy. I might question a few lines of script, as I think the natural progression of language in such a position would be a little different, but what experience do I have to say this would make a difference? I can question the long camera shot where the coffin looks like it is endless (I would have preferred that the timber was as high as the coffin is and just have soil as the walls while the camera is going up) but that still doesn't mean the movie is flawed.What we forget is this type of thing is happening all the time. Maybe not the exact issue, but cases where people working in such dangerous areas will and have been targets. If we think it is just their problem, then the problem is really ours. Why are accepting a world where such things are possible? What is the true problem, and how are we going to rectify it?It has been said that the power of the people is much stronger than the people in power. While we act as their tools, then things that compromise our safety this will always happen.What a tragedy that many, probably most, will think I am over-reacting. That's the problem. No one is reacting, really. Does anyone see that? What a tragedy that when someone portrays what is really happening, we really do not care.Fantastic film. I learned something about myself.

Try to think about it for a moment. There is only the darkness before your open eyes. You soon become very, very uncomfortable because you cannot move much in the coffin. You know the oxygen in the air is being decreased even if there is no measurement tool. There is probably no one to hear your desperate cry.

By choosing to concentrate wholly on its subject, the movie daringly forces the rigorous limits upon itself. It willingly does that right from the beginning. It even never attempts to get out of its rigid boundaries while firmly staying on its cramped area throughout its running time. Despite such burdensome constraints, the movie succeeds in not only achieving its goal but also deeply terrifying us.Let's talk about its horrible premise. After going down with the ominous main title sequence, we immediately meet Paul Conroy(Ryan Reynolds) in the coffin buried under the ground. It is somewhere in Iraq in 2006. Paul is a truck driver employed by some contracter company, and he remembers that his truck was ambushed right before he lost his consciousness. Poor guy, he only went there to support his family and he knew well about how dangerous place Iraq is, but he had probably never expected such a terrible situation like this.Fortunately for him(and the audience), there are still time, space, and light sources, and, above all, the chances for his survival. Although it is quite limiting for his body movements, the coffin has some little extra space for Paul. That means there is enough oxygen to sustain him for at least several hours. His personal effects were mostly taken away from him, but he still has his lighter in the pocket. There are also a flashlight, a fluorescent lightsaver, a cellular phone, and a knife in the coffin.Who put them there? It is apparent that Paul is being held as a hostage. The demand for ransom is delivered through the cellular phone. Paul will be left buried forever if the money is not delivered till the deadline. At least he can use the cell phone freely, so he calls 911, and then his wife, his company, and the Pentagon. However, ironically, the phone conversations with others only make him more desperate and frustrated while his precious time is running out along with the oxygen and the phone battery charge. He still finds himself as helpless as Barbara Stanwyck in ""Sorry, Wrong Number""(1948).By adamantly focusing on only one place, the director Rodrigo Cortés creatively maintains a high level of intensively dark, claustrophobic atmosphere. With several coffin sets and accompanying camera tricks and special effects, he only shows what happens in the coffin while never swaying from its straight and narrow path for any single moment. It is all about the experience with the utmost horror. There is no flashback in the movie. The people with whom Paul talks on the phone are not shown on the screen. We see and hear more and less than Paul can. We even cannot see what is happening directly above the coffin. And the effective use of widescreen emphasizes this extremely suffocating state.With this setting and Chris Sparling's smart script, Cortés makes his movie simultaneously gut-wrenching and compelling. I will not go into details about how he did it for not spoiling your experience. Let's just say the movie mercilessly and realistically stacks up the dread on the screen a second by a second in the fashion of ""The Pit and the Pendulum"", one of those short stories written by Edgar Allan Poe that scared me a lot during my childhood. If you remember those terrifying ordeals forced upon the hero step by step in that scary story, you will know what I mean.The movie is basically a one-man show that requires considerable talent from its actor, and Ryan Reynolds gives a credible performance that holds our attention from the beginning to the end. Despite being in the condition that is difficult for any capable actors, he convincingly carries the movie through every emotion imaginable in that trapped situation. It also should be mentioned that the actors providing the voices on the other end of the line are also important in supporting the drama and Reynolds' performance.""Buried"" is a gripping horror/thriller movie based. It sticks all the way with its simple premise to scare us, and, like any good horror movies, it works terrifyingly even when we do not see much from the screen because it lets our imagination to work by itself. To be frank with you, I had a memorable experience thanks to this movie. Several hours after watching the movie on this Wednesday night, I went to bed after turning the light out. It was all right at first, but then the images from the movie started to disturb my brain. Being buried alive is never, never, and never a funny thing to imagine.",Buried

And the cell phone has a signal.If someone were buried alive, he would not have been given all these things - whoever had put him there would most likely take these things away.The next unbelievable thing is that he is using a lighter so much, it would have used up the oxygen. The cell phone would probably not have a signal underground and in a box.So, even though the movie is full of suspense, it is totally unrealistic.",Buried
193,TVGuy3,Terrific For What It Is-TVGuy3's Review of Buried,9,24 September 2010,"This movie takes place in a coffin for 94 minutes and only a coffin. Sounds wicked boring, right? That's what I thought at first. But Buried is a thousand kinds of awesome. It's intense, it's scary at times, it's entertaining, a little bloody for the horror fans, and I am reminding you that this takes place in 94 minutes of almost nothing. Here's how the plot goes. Paul Conroy is a truck driver working in Iraq. He gets attacked by an Iraqi caravan of some sort and is held hostage 6 feet underground in a coffin for a million dollars. Now the best part of this movie is that you don't get to see what's happening above ground, so it keeps you guessing. There is a terrific performance by Ryan Reynolds, who finally tossed his love for crap projects and finally picked a good one. This is one of the most entertaining movies of the year and could pick up a few Saturn Awards, but I don't really see it winning anything else. Overall, it's a tense thriller with a great performance, an excellent screenplay and a shocking ending-Go see Buried. Grade: A- I'll see you guys soon when I review ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.""",Buried
194,schreiber-stephen,Not much like this movie,6,29 December 2018,"Wow, is this movie unique. Holds your attention throughout. There are a few moments in the first half that are completely absurd. The worst parts are the phone calls to the states he makes initially. That said this movie is one of the most bleak pieces I've seen and I don't think I will ever forget some moments captured. I felt like he was in an escape ""room"" of sorts at times and that all of this was going to be some kind of test at the end. The phone calls sometimes felt phony (pun intended) which makes you suspect of the situation and thus care less thinking that at some point the walls are going to open up and ""surprise!"" this was all a test. It didn't quite go that direction and by the end I was fully invested in the desperation depicted. Good movie but had the script been punched up a bit to have the viewer buy in immediately it would've been a much better film.",Buried
195,musanna-ahmed,Thrilling,8,29 October 2010,"Ask yourself, how can a film be so good in only one set? Yes there have been legendary films such as 12 Angry Men and Reservoir Dogs which just revolve around one set, but let's narrow it down. Ask yourself again, how does a film be so good, only showing ONE character? This film is a shining example of how it does.Ryan Reynolds stars as a US truck driver named Paul Conroy that finds himself buried alive. This is all we see throughout the film. Paul Conroy inside a coffin, with just a mobile phone and a lighter to aid him in his attempt to escape.The film has a good pace to it, we see Paul strings together a series of phone calls in which he gathers more and more information of how he ended up in the coffin. These phone calls prove significant about his attempt to escape as he is even called by the enemy himself who demands money by a certain time and therefore Paul has to believe he is held hostage and the way out is to obey the enemy's commands. The phone calls are intriguing, they keep you carefully listening to the responses of Paul and whoever is at the other end of the phone line.Throughout the film as more information is uncovered, the film becomes more and more tense and the result of it all keeps you waiting at the edge of your seat wondering what would happen at the end. And then the ending - an intense, emotional, yet fascinating ending.Believe it or not, even though you're just simply watching a guy in a box, you will not get bored watching this film. It's an absolute thriller. Ryan Reynolds delivered a marvellous performance as a confined individual struggling uncover the truth behind his situation and be liberated from it. Recommended if you want to see a fine thriller that is something you probably wouldn't have seen before.",Buried

No movie in history has ever come so close to realism. I think that's what makes it repulsive; it's because the movie is too real to watch.But ignoring that point, I must say it's a masterpiece. After maybe another 30 years, people's choice of movies might change and this might become a classic. I would recommend this to the people who love serious thrills and disturbing visuals.I would have rated it a little higher but...(No spoilers, don't worry)I rate it 7/10.",Buried
197,stevehoyland,An expensive Burial....,3,28 April 2016,"Oh dear! A man (Paul Conroy) Is kidnapped In Iraq and held In a buried Coffin. That's It! Unless the one single actor we actually get to see got a hefty pay-day, or the co-star (the Coffin) was made of some extremely expensive timber, your guess Is as good as mine with regards to where the £3,000,000 budget went! Not so much as a single shot outside of the box - no establishing shots, nothing to show him being kidnapped, his worried family and friends, nothing. Perhaps this Is to make us feel the claustrophobia and helplessness felt by Paul as we go through the best part of two-hours In real time as If we are with him In the box. Despite his finding It Increasingly difficult to breath from the outset, he nevertheless uses his Cigarette lighter as a torch - a Zippo with a huge flame - which, amazingly, doesn't burn-up the little amount of Oxygen there Is In a few seconds as one would expect, neither Is there any smoke or fumes from It despite Zero ventilation. Later, he even has a fire In the coffin, which burns fiercely despite the lack of oxygen, not to mention the build-up of Carbon dioxide/monoxide from all the fire and his desperate and panicky deep-breathing. For once, we have a Cell phone on an American film which - wait for It - not only has a signal but also a half-full(or half-empty!)battery! How he manages to contact so many people with ease despite being 6-foot underground In the Iraqi desert Is another story. Incidentally, the Coffin seems to gradually Increase In size as the film progresses, from his being almost unable to move at the start to being able to almost sit up later on! Just a few outside-of-the-coffin scenes would have enhanced this Movie a great deal. Whatever the background story, one man In a box does not, In my opinion, constitute enough of a story for a three million dollar movie. Well, that's It. It's a film about a man In a box with a seemingly endless supply of air(and presumably a Carbon dioxide scrubber). If I told you whether he lives or dies at the end then It really wouldn't be worth your watching It - not that It's worth watching In the first place. The last minutes of the Movie are the only worthwhile part, so I won't spoil It by saying what happens. If you can stay awake long enough to get that far, that Is. Not worth watching and certainly not worth the scandalous amount of money that It supposedly cost.",Buried

199,One_slice_of_pizza,An Idiot's Survival Guide...,3,11 May 2011,"""Buried"", is a movie about a dumb American truck driver named Paul Conroy, who gets buried in a box in Iraq, by ""some"" poor commoners who have no intentions other than to feed their families. Oh my gosh, please give me a break...This movie is such a fail, i don't even know where to start. The story doesn't make any sense, the protagonist does not make any sense and the whole movie is full of flaws that will even put off the viewers who like to watch Sesame Street on a Friday night. I don't know why but I guess the script writer really enjoyed showing us Americans as dumb as possible.He is buried in a box, has limited oxygen and yet he keeps flaming that Zippo for the entire movie, although all the alternative light sources such as flashlight, flares and a cell phone.He manages to find the cell phone and the first thing he does is to call 911! I mean, how more ignorant can you be? Doesn't matter where you are, you can call 911 from anywhere in the world, because you are an American! As if the cell phone recognizes your nationality and directs your calls accordingly. In this movie we learned that, if you use a local GSM in Iraqi desert, you get connected to 911 Ohio.In the beginning of the movie, Paul wonders how he is getting a signal inside a box buried deep down under ground, and Dan gives him a life saver clue, that it can't be that deep. So Paul does exactly what a dumb American would do. Nothing...He doesn't even try escaping although he has a knife. He cries, sobs, groans, calls everyone in America and yells at them but he does nothing with the knife, except cutting his finger off with it...He wastes his only liquid resource by spilling it on a snake to burn it so not only he can be thirsty but also he can waste the limited oxygen he has. Why crash it with your boots when you can burn right? Also, if a snake can get in and out of the box, you can't be too freaking far from the ground. Maybe he is a head down the ground, but he never freaking tries to find out and that drives you crazy and makes you hate him more.He never manages to think about calling CIA. He calls FBI instead, as if they are the local agency who has the most experience and know how in an international hostage situation.And this is all about the movie. Some idiot doing everything he can, NOT to survive. He has all the necessary tools, yet he manages to die. This movie is not a survival movie. It's just a torture movie about an idiot, that we have to watch him die in 95 minutes.I have never seen a more annoying and dumb movie character as Paul Conroy before. We have no reason to like him, because there's no emotional attachment, no back story. The entire movie is just a box and an idiot with tools who doesn't know what to do with them. No locations, nothing.Buried had it's potential. Unfortunately, it's a great story gone bad. My advice: Just save your money and donate to a charity instead.Believe me, you will do more good and feel much better at the end...",Buried
200,CinemaPat,"Definition of the phrase ""Style over Substance""",4,10 February 2011,"Where oh where to begin? ""Buried"" has been widely praised by critics and moviegoers alike. I have no idea why. Were they brainwashed during the 94 minute hell hole that is ""Buried""? Did Ryan Reynolds personally go to each critics house and do their laundry? This film was poorly written, acted and the third act was not put together well at all. It's a shame too because the beginning of the film had promise. I had high hopes for the star Ryan Reynolds based on his impressive performance in ""The Amityville Horror"" remake, unfortunately he didn't deliver in this outing. This film is the definition of the phrase ""style over substance"".""Buried"" is the story of an American contractor working in Iraq as a driver. His group is ambushed by supposed terrorists who kill some and kidnap others. Paul played by Reynolds does not fair so well as he is buried alive in the vast Iraq desert. The film begins as a black screen with hardly any sound, we start to hear breathing as tension and fear begins to build. Paul realizes that he's been buried underground with a cell phone, Zippo lighter, knife, flask of alcohol, flashlight and glow-sticks. His battle begins to find a way out of the grave danger he's in when the kidnappers call demanding a ransom.First, the good things; though they are few. The decision to film entirely inside the coffin was smart. It added an extra layer of realism to an already terrifying concept. ""Buried"" was very well shot and produced as seen in the first act. It had excellent sound and camera work as well so the tension was genuine. Director of Photography Eduard Grau gave just enough space between the camera and Reynolds to not overdue the claustrophobic feeling. The cinematography scored very high points for me. The idea of being buried for ransom was new and I appreciated Iraq being the setting. The first act was intense and fearful as the plot began to come around, but it was ruined with the second and third acts.I mentioned the concept was fresh and new, which I appreciated, but the way in which the plot unfolded was just ridiculous. There were so many instances that I thought were just completely implausible and unnecessary. Once Paul finally gets in contact with the State Department, the representative quietly and secretively tells him to contact a group specifically set up in the middle east to deal with kidnap situations. Why on earth would this information had to have been whispered to Paul? Why couldn't the State Department just contact them for Paul? A very unrealistic moment.One of the things left in the coffin for Paul to find was a ""Zippo"" lighter. He had that thing lit for more than half of the film. In a low oxygen environment that isn't the best idea. Not to mention it seemed to have a constant abundance of butane. Also, when using the cell phone he continued to use the Zippo to light the space in front of him. Sure this works for the camera lighting but is this realistic? No.Speaking of the cell phone, it was obvious (and told to Paul), that since he was getting a signal he was not that far beneath the surface. At one point someone says to him that he must not be more than three feet down. If I were Paul I would have found a way to break through the wood and dig upwards three feet to safety. So again, unrealistic.Those are just a few examples of why this movie fails. At one point later in the film I literally felt insulted by the writing. It is such a shame too because this had high potential to be a unique, intense movie experience. I can't fault Reynolds completely because I know he has the chops to pull of intense drama but he just was not directed well. ""Buried"" was made by inexperienced filmmakers and it showed. It boggles my mind that this is getting such good reviews, specifically from the likes of Roger Ebert.I only need to direct you to the ""100 Things we learned from Buried"" thread on IMDb's message board to see the kind of terrible writing showcased in this film. See it and form your own opinion. Drop me a line if you agree or disagree.http://cinemapat.blogspot.com/2011/02/buried-2010-rodrigo-cortes.html",Buried
201,tomdude0,Pretty suspenseful considering it's 90 minutes in a coffin,7,10 June 2011,"Paul Conroy is a truck driver in Iraq whose convoy is ambushed by insurgents. He wakes up buried in a coffin with a lighter, a cell phone, a flask, a knife, some glowsticks, a flashlight, and 90 minutes of oxygen. He has to somehow use these tools to stay alive until he is found.Considering it's 90 minutes of Ryan Reynolds in a coffin, it was pretty darn suspenseful. The film made me tense up for minutes at a time until I could finally exhale. Sure, a lot of it is talking on the phone, but the conversations get heated as Paul grows more and more desperate.Reynolds provides a pretty believable performance. I'm sure if I woke up buried in a coffin I'd be having a panic attack and run out of oxygen very quickly. Reynold's character, Paul, however, calms down a little after a short amount of time. It made me wonder, but hey, they're making a movie, not a 90-minute close-up of some guy thrashing around in a coffin.From my point of view, Buried is a political film. There's some sharp criticisms of the government and how they handle things. It made me wonder.A film worth seeing, but it's not a memorable one. It's 90 minutes of intensity that, while suspenseful, won't make it past your eyes.",Buried
202,issachar,It's just a bad Blackberry Ad. Not recommended neither for survival or entertainment,1,27 December 2010,"In 90 mins, you will see how fast this Blackberry battery goes, and how stupid Paul is trying to get himself out from the coffin.Okay, this is probably a man's worst nightmare - buried alive. But in this movie, no fancy story behind, but just about war, terrorists, govt, etc. The most boring boring boring element.So here we goes, with a phone that actually have reception, a zippo lighter, a knife, there are lots of ways to try to get himself out, but in every ways he does, he did it the wrong way.Now I think even an idiot knows we need oxygen to stay alive, and in this case, our Paul seems to think there are actually too much oxygen for him, so he decided to light up the zippo and burn as much as oxygen every time he make a stupid phone call!!!! COME ON PAUL!!! I don't see Paul is getting smart but with a phone he probably could just call anyone that able to help him. But he chose to trust the US Govt. Alright, that's your call Paul, but when his company, FBI and whatever dealing-with-hostage-expert cannot help, Paul, You'd better think of something better.Here is my favorite part, a fxxking snake came from no where, suddenly appear in Paul's pants and then get out. Okay, I can live with that, becoz when a snake could get in, and Paul have a knife, he could probably at least try to break the coffin and dig his way out! Nah, our Paul still think he has enough oxygen and let's burn the snake heck out! Blah blah blah that with that lawsuit phone call from his company, what the hell??? There are ways to make Paul desperate but this part is just a really sick cheap shot!!!! I don't really see how Paul is getting himself out, but just watching him die every minute closer.Some people might think they not gonna buy a blackberry phone becoz the battery run out in 90 mins. =p Some people might think Paul might get out and let's see how he do it. But no, he is dead becoz he's stupid.Some people might think what the heck, I just want to watch a movie for fun...

206,Playbahnosh,Unique in it's own right but flawed in some ways,7,23 June 2011,"After reading all the conflicting reviews about Buried that range from ""Absolute Masterpiece of the Century"" to ""boring, stupid waste of time"", I decided to see it for myself. I concluded, that both sides have merit to their words.The movie sees truck driver Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) waking up inside a buried wooden box after his supply convoy got attacked in Iraq by insurgents. Armed with only a phone, a lighter and little else, he needs to get out of there alive. It's hard to write a review about this movie without spoiling anything, so no more story details, go watch it if your are interested.First of all, Buried really is a unique movie in it's own right. Made with the budget of about a weekly grocery shopping, it's one of best made minimalist thrillers out there. The camera work, the lighting the directing and the music is great and we can see one of (if not THE) best and most believable acting performance of Ryan Reynolds. There is rarely a dull moment during the entire movie, when you'd last expect it, it pulls a new trick on you. This is all a huge feat, since the whole movie takes place inside a simple wooden box. Well done! What I had problems with is the screenplay and the faults in logic and the failure of common sense. I can't even state an example without revealing spoilers, but there are some blatantly obvious faults in logic concerning possible ways of escape, conserving oxygen and using the tools at Paul's disposal. Even in moments of sheer desperation Paul remains aloof and seemingly unaware of his surroundings and the hints he gets. Another problem is with the reaction of various people he talks to on the phone. And the last problem is the blatant un-/misuse of the features of the modern smartphone they use in the movie, that could've possibly provided immensely more help.It's a nightmare to dance around the spoiler-mines, so to wrap it up I only say, that if you like thrillers and/or uniquely crafted movies, go watch Buried, and you will get a really nice experience.",Buried

The lighting, the camera angles, the plot. Brilliantly driven and acted. I found myself on the edge of my seat quite a few times, and felt I could relate to the simple fact that most humans are useless in a crisis. This is not just a film about a man in a box, it's so much more than that. It's full of depth and story. Some say they found the film very claustrophobic but I felt oddly soothed by the whole affair. I actually dropped off for a few seconds on several occasions. Not because the film is boring, far from it in fact. It's just full of natural sounds, which were really relaxing, in an odd way. It also came to my attention that some people just don't know what a good film is. They just can't appreciate anything different. The cinema was full of fat and scruffy teenagers, expecting to be scared. They ended up disappointed due to the lack of blood and gore. After the film finished, all I heard was profanity. The film was awful apparently. To tell you the truth, it's one of the best films of 2010. It's different and imaginative, and just such a massive step up from the generic movies the film industry is churning out at the moment.

What I can say is that it is possible to make a movie who totally plays out underground. There are no cutbacks to the outside world. We only hear voices through the telephone! Ryan Reynolds usually does lighter fare but boy does he shine in this one.He was totally credible as the unfortunate truck-driver in way over his head.

Director Rodrigo Cortes keeps the drama entirely inside this average-sized coffin-like box but as anyone who watched Hitchcock play with space and tension in Rope and Lifeboat will know how inventive one has to be with limited room, Cortes used his skill to make this experiment work brilliantly with some interesting lighting effects to keep it visually interesting. After watching this movie I was left physically trembling. This was partly because the final five minutes are about as nail-biting as five minutes of film can possibly be, but mostly because of the tremendous adoration I have for the filmmakers who have achieved so much with so little. Whoever says you need to think outside the box should think again, because Buried is nothing short of a minimalist masterpiece. bravo for a very brave ending.",Buried
210,movieevangelist,Review: Buried,9,28 January 2011,"The Pitch: Saving Driver Ryan.The Review: Ryan Reynolds is actually a pretty talented comic actor, but over the years he's struggled to find material to best fit his easy-going style. Probably best known for his wisecracking roles in movies like Blade: Trinity or his similar TV work, his profile may be about to get much bigger with the two comic book franchises he's got in the works – so if you wanted to take someone, possibly the most unlikely someone you could, and stick them in a coffin buried underground and basically torture them for an hour and a half, then Reynolds feels like the ideal candidate.Normally at about this point in a review I might embark on a brief summation of the plot for those unfamiliar with the story, so here goes. It's Ryan Reynolds. He's a contracted truck driver working in Iraq. He's been kidnapped and buried alive in a coffin. He's got a mobile phone, and has to get out before he runs out of signal or air, or both. That's it. It's a concept so high it should have little flashing warning lights to ward off aeroplanes, and it's the kind of thing that Hitchcock in his heyday would have been proud of, for several reasons. While the great man was fond of a high concept himself, it wasn't just their mere nature that fascinated him, but the possibilities that they could lend themselves to.You might think that just one man and the inside of a coffin would get a little dull after a while, but director Rodrigo Cortes has worked out all his angles, and there's not an inch of the coffin left unexplored over the course of the running time, including a few slightly artificial long shots that help to reinforce the isolation, but we are trapped down there for the duration in an admirable display of commitment to the concept, and Cortes uses that fact to start ratcheting the tension up to unbearable levels. We do hear other people, including the unmistakable tones of Steven Tobolowsky, as well as Robert Patterson and Samantha Mathis among others, as Reynolds' Paul Conroy attempts to attract a rescue before it's too late, but visually the only face we see is that of Reynolds.He steps up manfully to the challenge, throwing his emotions at the screen and allowing you to share in the terror of his character's plight. The immersive nature of the cinematography will help you to feel trapped with him, and as his situation worsens, the movie exerts a vice-like grip around your nerves. I wouldn't confess to being too much of a claustrophobic, but by the end I was glad to see the wide open spaces outside the cinema, as what Cortes and Reynolds have achieved is incredibly effective. Taut, suspenseful and well structured, you even let it get away with the odd bit of cheekiness (one other thing ends up in the box at one point, which in other hands might have stretched disbelief, but you're happy to let them run with it), and somehow from the confines of this tiny prison it manages to work in social and political commentary among all the tension in a way that never feels forced and only enhances. It will make you amazed at what Reynolds is actually capable of given the right material, but it will also leave you clamouring to see what Cortes can do next.Why see it at the cinema: It's almost a dare to see if you can cope with it. If you're especially claustrophobic, you may wish to sit close to the exit, just in case.The Score: 9/10",Buried
211,kels-errific,"a jolting, innovative, disappointing experience",7,8 October 2010,"I like movies that I can watch again. Its not to say movies that don't have re-playability can not be good, just that in Buried's case, I will not see this movie again. It is an intense, innovative movie that is held together by one actor. Its not a franchise, has zero special effects, and literally rides on Mr. Reynold's shoulders. That's pretty bold into today's film scene. The basic premise: a man who is working for a truck convoy in Iraq is abducted and put in a box, ""buried"" alive. He is given a lighter, and a cell phone in his coffin, and that's it. He is instructed to produce money for his captors if he is to get out alive. Anybody who has seen Kill Bill Volume 2 can empathize that being buried alive is frightening. Picture the Bride's Texas funeral stretched out into a film, and your not far off. As I sat in the theatre, I felt claustrophobic. The camera angles and setting will get to you, it just feels eerie. The sounds, and the dark amplify what a horrifying experience it would be. I felt myself sinking in my seat, and the audience was there with me. Everyone was on board for the movie, buuuut then the ending happened. In this age of surprise endings, I was convinced that it would be some lame twist. The whole movie holds you at a fever pitch, and then... it ends. In such a disappointing way ( sans a twist, thankfully) , you feel cheated as you invested all this emotion into the film for a sad send-off. As soon as the movie ended, the lights in the theatre went on, and the audience looked at each other in utter confusion. What the hell just happened? Up until the ending, the movie was great, but as the film rode into its conclusion, it fell apart in my opinion, and for that I give it a seven.",Buried

He might not have made it to the surface depending on how deep he was but at least he would have died trying, digging through sand ain't half as bad as soil.I'm thinking the guy who came up with the idea had been watching that episode of Alias where Sydney gets buried in Havana and thought hey i could make a whole movie about that.",Buried

When I first heard that the film takes place all in one location, I was concerned: could one actor, in one space, hold my attention for an entire feature? The answer, Ryan Reynolds can — and with flying colors. ""Buried"" is a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, that is potentially buried somewhere in modern day Iraq. Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) finds himself alone in a wooden box, with only his cell phone and lighter. How and why he got there is the question asked throughout the film, and we discover the answer along with our puzzled protagonist Conroy. The audience is trapped down there with him feeling desperate, claustrophobic, suffocated. At times, it feels all too real. If you are uncomfortable about tight spaces, this film will get you squirming in your seat. The use of darkness, practical light sources and sound help bring this film to life. You feel the walls closing in as Conroy's cell phone battery starts to die. Cortes includes plenty of metaphors about capitalism, terrorism and human ignorance, through clever phone conversations between Conroy and various agency authorities he looks to for help.

214,BeautifulDisaster5287,Talk About Claustrophobia...,9,17 January 2011,"OK so this movie is about a truck driver named Paul Conroy (the wonderful Ryan Reynolds), who is working in Iraq when his group of workers (who are actually trying to help over there) get blown up by ""terrorists"". He wakes up buried in a box with a lighter, knife, flashlight, some glow sticks, and a Backberry. The entire film takes place in actual time. Also the entire film takes place in the box so if you are claustrophobic, do yourself a favor and rent something else.Unlike Other Movies Right Now: This film takes place in actual time (like 24). I thought it was soooo well done and oh! beware of the crazy twist ending...gave me chills.Best Scenes: 1. When Paul first calls a woman from the government and she knows his name....chills againnn. 2. The ending.Let's Get Political: In my opinion, this movie hits on a topic that is pretty right on. The film takes place in 2006 and even to this day, there are tons of POW over in Iraq and ransom videos like the one in this movie. Every one of their situations are different. Yet the government would rather just kill the terrorists and not care about the prisoners? On the other hand, it's tough to decide what the right action is unless you have had to make a decision like that which I, thankfully, haven't.Best Lines: 1. Paul: ""Yea, you're a terrorist you son of a b**ch."" Jabir: ""You terrified, so I'm terrorist"" 2. Dan Brenner: ""I'm so sorry, Paul.""Overall: Yes, it is a little tough to watch and parts of it are left open, but in my opinion, it adds to the suspense and also, this movie is totally underrated. I enjoyed it and was definitely on the edge of my seat. It's nice to see something a little different for a change.9/10 Stars. Read all my reviews at http://dianalynn5287.blogspot.com/",Buried
215,patrickmbrame,"Unconventional, Dark, Twisted, and Suspenseful",9,8 January 2011,"One of the most unconventional, disturbing, and fully suspenseful films I have seen in a while. Ryan Reynolds is great as Paul Conroy, a contract truck driver in Iraq during the war who is captured and buried alive in the desert. As you watch the movie you begin to learn more and more information about his character, however from the very beginning you care about him getting out of that damn coffin because Reynolds gives such a brilliant performance, plus it also helps that anyone would feel some kind of pity for anyone stuck in a coffin. Going into it I read all the hype and was expecting a fantastic film, yet I was still pretty skeptical with the whole movie taking place inside a coffin. Literally all 90 minutes of the film is underground, inside a coffin. And for all of those 90 minutes I was anxious, scared, and completely enthralled with what I was watching due in large part because Rodrigo Cortes is an unbelievable story teller. Buried loosely reminds of a Hitchcock film, with the setting taking place all in one place giving the audience the same feeling of claustrophobia that Reynolds himself is feeling (clearly not to the same degree). The opening credits of the film is particularly well done, right away before you even see one frame of the story, you know that you are in for a wild ride of twists, turns, and incomprehensible suspense. When you are finally introduced to Paul in the coffin you are immediately on the edge of your seat and stay their for the entirety of the film. Cortes puts you right in the coffin with Reynolds, what he sees the audience sees, the phone conversations has you hear, and because of Reynolds performance you feel what he feels making the experience of watching the film that much more terrifying. He then takes you on a roller coaster ride through hope and then the complete abandonment of hope. Over and over, and over and over again. It's almost to the point where Cortes is laughing at you knowing what your going through watching this film. At the same time this horror film going on about being buried alive, you are thrown all kinds of current event themes, the Iraq War, United States Government policies and other political themes, as well as selfish private corporations, that are intertwined into the story. This is an awesome film to watch and it is a huge disappointment that it was never released nationwide and got more press, so either download it or wait for it to get released on DVD/Blu-Ray which hopefully will be soon. It's a suspenseful and thrilling movie all within one setting, a box. Any film that could be that exciting, all taking place in a box, there's no other reason to see it then curiosity. But if you need them, if your a Ryan Reynolds you'll absolutely enjoy have a good time as well as any fan of the unconventional. This is easily one of the better films of the year (and has the best song over the end credits in film history) and it's a shame that it didn't get more press or For Your Considerations.

216,AlanMichaelElliott,One Unbelievable Flaw Can Destroy A Masterpiece,7,14 January 2011,"Looking at the overall view of this movie it had all the makings of a masterpiece and coming in certainly at one of the lowest budgets ever in the making of such an intense thriller. The incredible opening credits must have taken at least three-quarters of that budget alone. With the film being intensely suspenseful from start to finish I was thrilled at the splendid timing and the portrayal of the storyline except for in one instance. Once I saw that instance I was terribly disappointed as it was one of those ""suddenly stop-shocking"" revelations that can destroy for me the whole credibility of a good film. If only the director, editor, screenplay-writer or the entire collaboration of professionals had seen this bad aspect, I am sure the film would have gone down in history as one of the great shining gems of all of the small budget features. Unfortunately, it was obviously wrong to introduce the snake where it was introduced. Surely all of the physical panic-thrashing generated by the actor when he first consciously realized he was buried alive would have aggravated the snake to bite him and not haphazardly slip out of the actor's pant leg much further down the storyline. Nope, I can not buy that. I am sorry, but the story's intrigue was lost for me, then and there.",Buried

RR made off like a bandit! Yes, the ending sucked... but RR did most of it. I myself could give a more commanding performance breathing LESS OXYGEN at a mere fraction of what Lionsgate paid Ryan.

Don't think I've ever seen a movie so minimalist (only one character & one ""room"" shown) so to keep excitement going throughout is a testament to everyone involved (including Reynolds) and an inspiration to any low budget film makers, proving you only need a camera and one cast member to make a decent film.I applaud the brave ending too, although not so sure about the song at end credits.

This is *nothing* like this. I was bored each and every excruciating second. It is literally as if sitting in a box and watching paint dry or sand fill. I HATE artsy films like this. I tried watching Birdman three times and ever since I got 10 mins within that I gave up. I was hoping against hope, this trash of a film would have some thrilling or suspenseful 'happy' end, but God. There was no twist. It is bland. While Hugh Jackman's Prisoners was convoluted and also artsy, these are terrible waste of movie watchers'/goers' time.Why do filmmakers think that they can get away with self-patting, scratching-each-other-back, self-congratulating sh****y films like this. Unless you are a film major (read: film geek) who gets a hard- ** from camera editing or lighting effect, you really need to avoid these type of films unless it gives some oxygen and meaning to your otherwise pretentious, inauthentic life.1.5 most boring hour of my life that I endured just hoping it'd pan out well.Also note, I was hoping the snake scene would be a hallucination.

That would have been badass I only gave it 2 instead of 1 because the concept was original of restraining in one setting.This also reminded me of Locke and also that pseudo-intellectual, 'character study' that film nerds get all uppity about.Note to filmmakers: No one cares about your pretentious crap. You are out there to entertain, go and do that. Don't frikkin con people. I pity those who actually went to theaters to watch this painful tripe.

The movie is already to long for that not to mention the how he is full of fear (using up more air) make it 1 hour and he would be going to the other world and that is not fiction.

Don't get me wrong I got nothing against the guy but he seems to have a case of George Clooney syndrome. You know... the one where he can only play a role as himself. Though it may not be his fault, directors usually tell actors how to portray a character so maybe its not him. Either way I saw the trailer and said ""Nothing but Ryan in box for the whole movie? No way is this going to be good"" sure enough at the end of the movie I had to contemplate life and reassure myself what happened to him would most likely never happen to me. That is the impact on this movie, it is just so heart wrenching and sad while being extremely uncomfortable and scared. I actually felt claustrophobic during this movie, I felt as if I was in that box. I felt the air slowly getting heavier and I felt every emotion expressed by Ryan.That never happens to me in movies, I can't be immersed like that I don't know why. But this one definitely got to me and I could actually feel myself getting choked up at times. This is by far Ryan's best performance. That fact that this entire movie takes place inside a box with no real face time with any other actor other than Ryan Reynolds and actually pull off a great movie is NO easy task. This takes serious dedication to his role and some great writing to make the story work around this one setting.This movie couldn't have ended any other way, no alternate ending, no directors edition, this is purely realism at its finest and that is a movie experience I hope I continue to see. For movies that don't want to take chances again just look at what can be accomplished if its done right. And setting people off on a roller-coaster of emotions is not easily done by pushing a cute kitty into on coming traffic. Shocking imagery can not compensate for realistic human emotions and Ryan did just that. You will feel as if all hope of him getting out of that box is gone and its the end of the line for him but wait they can actually track him down and they are on their way right now? The Air Force just bombed closely to his area he is buried so the Air Force can just send the coordination of where they just bombed and dig him out right?

Being buried alive has got be one of the worst fears for many people and director Rodrigo Cortes brings every detail to life. This film is unlike anything I've seen. From the first frame to last the entire film is in a coffin and the only visual break you get is from the darkness, which doesn't help. I felt very claustrophobic while watching this, so if you have issues with this, don't watch it. Its a very well crafted thriller for only $3 Million, seems low but there really is no other person or places in this movie. You only hear voices on the other end of the phone, everyone from his wife, 911 operator to his captives but the camera never cuts away. There is one very creepy scene where a certain slithering reptile finds its way into the coffin and our hero needs to figure out how to deal with it. So , is there a happy ending, does he ever get rescued, you'll just have to see it to find out. Its only in limited release so if its playing near you , check it out, its a must see! My only hang up was casting Ryan Reynolds in this role. Don't get me wrong, He is fantastic, he makes it work with what little he has to work with, but having an unknown actor would have made the whole experience even more real. for more no nonsense, honest, thoughtful reviews check out THE-TICKING-TICKET...is the movie worth your time? http://tickingticket.blogspot.com/",Buried
236,HiPalmetto,Just about the most excitement you can get out of a box!,7,29 October 2010,"Incredibly gripping, incredibly claustrophobic. Don't be surprised if you find your fingernails embedded in the armrests at the end of this film, if you haven't already squirmed to the floor. Sags momentarily in the middle, but remains a quite overwhelming experience, given the limitations of the scenario. Even though I found the plot predictable - there are only so many twists that can be added to the original situation - it never failed to satisfy. For some of the audience the ending was unexpected. Not for me, but that din't detract from the way I experienced this movie. And it is a movie to experience, not just watch. Scarier than a dozen Paranormal Activities.",Buried

He's just too damn good looking. Really, guys like that make it difficult for average joes to be attractive to women. What a dick. I digress.This movie was amazing. Reynolds acting was the best he's ever done. He really captures the emotions of his character and expresses them without shame. I was absolutely mesmerized. I didn't even hear of this movie until it was on video, and what a shame. Reynolds' character is basically the only one in the movie. If there had been even a bit of poor acting it would have ruined the film. Reynolds dominates the film and takes the viewer on an emotional ride that will stay with you. Definitely, definitely watch this film.",Buried

The whole movie takes place where Paul is trapped, which is something I really liked. The Movie was especially depressing when you find out he has a wife and son. At the end of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat! He called his wife and told her he was about to get out. She made him promise that he'd be home and he promised. Then he calls the people who are getting him out. Only to find out that they went to the wrong area. So he's is left to drown in the sand that is falling through the coffin. And that's where it ends... with the coffin full of sand... and nothing else. I give this movie a 10/10 and need to buy it!!",Buried

Somehow, they managed to make a movie where you do not relate to the character, the suspense is non-existent and it all feels very unreal. The idea about this movie is good but it is all shot in such a way that you just do not feel almost any suspense and are mostly bored. The physics in this movie are extremely unrealistic and also the way technology (the phone) behaves is not realistic (with the ""looking for the signal"" thing etc.). I think you should spare your time and not watch this but it has 7/10 from the majority of people so I guess someone actually enjoyed this. There are more illogical things in the movie but I do not want to write spoilers so see for yourself how many will ""face-palm"" you. I kind of liked the ending though but it did not make up for the first 89 minutes of boredom. Also, I think they should have chosen a different actor for this one and also all the voice actors should be punched in the face for giving such bad performance.",Buried

241,mme3924-1,What's the point.......?,3,27 October 2019,"Of this hour and a half claustrophobic film in which a man is buried alive?Another reviewer said it was about the man's choices. Seriously? He doesn't have any choices! Other than to burn his lighter --and his oxygen -- because the dark is worse. Or whether to use his phone for human contact, or save the battery, hoping the signal will lead rescuers to him. Or to wait and hope and fight panic and despair.Three calls he does make pretty much summed up my reaction to the film. One was the last phone call to his wife, who has, incredibly, not answered her phone all day, even though her husband has a dangerous job in a foreign country where terrorism is common, a job she advised against. But it's the dialogue itself that made my lip curl. ""I love you so much"" repeated by each multiple times. In reality, they would, no doubt, express their love but be sobbing, incoherent; there are no words in such a situation, much less the same words said by both repeatedly. Perhaps I'm too harsh but instead of emotionally realistic that scene felt inane and certainly the dialogue did.Then there was the phone call with the lawyer and how long it took him to catch on that the company was going on record -- and getting him to -- of denying any liability. First, I don't think the coldest hearted company in the world would do such a thing to a man they know is buried alive. But anti-capitalist Hollywood does not miss an opportunity to paint corporations as unfeeling and monstrous.And, finally, there's the phone call from his contact at international rescue or whatever it is, who actually tells him that their informant has led them to the wrong ""buried in the desert"" person, that they still have no idea where he is. Who and why would he tell him say such a thing, knowing the man has minutes left to live?The one phone call that is realistic is when he tells this same informant, in bitter recognition and resignation: ""You don't care about us. You're babysitting. You're just waiting."" It's true; all the guy on the phone can do is try to pacify and reassure a man trapped beneath several feet of sand in a box, with no way out, completely dependent on others, unable, no matter his will, to save himself.As a character study, the film provides little since we don't know who Paul is before he found himself buried alive. No flashbacks to his earlier life, no pictures of wife and kids, no joking around with buddies. Just him, in a coffin, with a phone, a lighter, a knife, and a pen, the last two, by the way, curious. Why did his kidnappers leave him a knife and pen? Ryan Reynolds is very good in a role that couldn't have been easy, having sand sift down on you, no headroom, delivering every line while lying flat, and being in absolutely every scene. But he's not, perhaps, enough to recommend this film, which can't even be seen as a triumph of the will.",Buried
242,mrtomclift,An unrelenting thriller with surprising emotional depth,10,27 March 2011,"Buried is a film that Alfred Hitchcock would have loved. From its artful opening credits clearly inspired by the work of Saul Bass (who worked on many Hitchcock films including Psycho and North by North West) to its dramatic and heart-pounding conclusion, the film is a ninety minute real time experience of razor-sharp intensity and unwavering suspense, one that showcases the talents of its relatively inexperienced writer, director and star in equally impressive measures. Directed by Spanish filmmaker Rodrigo Cortés from a screenplay by first time writer Chris Sparling, the movie stars burgeoning A-lister Ryan Reynolds as Paul Conroy, an American contractor working in Iraq who is taken hostage by insurgents and buried in a coffin in the middle of the desert. The premise may seem limiting, but despite the fact that neither the camera nor the lead character ever leave the confines of coffin, Cortés weaves a web of remarkable tension, combing the clever, naturally twisting script with inventive lighting, editing and camera work to produce a film that is claustrophobic, unpredictable, and will grip you from beginning to end.Starling's screenplay is absolutely fantastic. Opening on a pitch black screen, the audience begins the film in exactly same position as the protagonist; disoriented, with no clue as to our surroundings. For several minutes all we have to go on is the sound of ragged breathing and frantic scratching, before a lighter finally sparks to life and we get our first glimpse at Paul Conroy and the wooden prison that contains him. Slowly but surely, more and more is revealed; a cell phone begins to vibrate, and as Paul relates information to the first of a long line of unseen, unhelpful bureaucrats and military personal, so too do we begin to gain a greater understanding of the situation. A civilian truck driver for a private company, Paul has been in Iraq for close to nine months delivering supplies as part of the rebuilding effort. While in the Diyala Provence, his convoy was attacked and he was knocked unconscious; the last thing he remembers before waking up, buried alive.What Buried soon boils down to is a series of frantic phone conversations. That this could make for interesting viewing may seem implausible, but in actuality these conversations make for some of the most thrilling cinema you can possibly imagine. The dialogue, fast paced and frenzied, is delivered with increasing fear, anger and frustration by a sweat and dirt covered Ryan Reynolds, who delivers a performance that does a great deal to counter his pretty boy image. Forced to constantly clarify and repeat himself, Paul spits and swears in frustration, struggling desperately to maintain some sense of composure – not to mention a cell signal – as he is bounced around from official to official, none of whom seem to be able to offer any kind of real assistance. This goes on for about forty-five minutes, until filmmaker, writer and actor suddenly deliver an unexpected and emotionally devastating interlude. Faced with the possibility that he may not survive this ordeal, Paul makes a heartfelt phone-call to his mother, and from this point on, even once the movie soon regains its heart-racing pace, the audience is invested in Paul's struggle on a deep and genuinely human level.Director Rodrigo Cortés does excellent work enhancing both the thrills and the poignancy of Sparling's script. From a narrative standpoint, Buried shares many similarities with Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. Visually however, they could not be more different. While Boyle's film featured extended prologue and epilogue sequences, and incorporated flashbacks and scenes of fantasy, Cortés' movie is truly a one location film, the camera quite literally trapped in the coffin with Paul. In spite of this, Cortés utilizes inventive angles and subtle camera movements to conjure fear and apprehension in his audience, feelings enhanced by the excellent if occasionally overly intrusive score. Lighting also plays a crucial part, and be it through the yellow flicking of a Zippo light or the eerie blue glow of a cell phone screen, Cortés and director of photography Edward Grau have created a surprisingly beautiful looking film. Most importantly, Cortes' camera-work, on a more empathetic level, helps depict Paul's feelings of claustrophobia, fear, betrayal and isolation, and plays on the audiences feelings to great effect.Buried is a sensational, exciting, moving, unrelenting and ultimately exhausting movie going experience. Before I conclude this review, there is one scene in particular that I must mention, in which Paul talks on the phone with a representative of his employers. I'll not spoil the scenes outcome, other than to say that it may be the most powerful and well written sequence in the entire film. To write that this film is an indictment of the fallibilities and general vileness of bureaucracy is a serious understatement, and to that degree it is relatable to just about anyone who has experienced the frustrations that come with being put on hold. In terms of pure cinematic craftsmanship and visceral thrills however, even that scene pales in comparison to the movies climax, a captivating, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat culmination of all the shocks and emotions that preceded it, and will leave many viewers sitting stunned, drained and disbelieving.",Buried
243,Chrismeister,Tension Filled but Ultimately Depressing.,7,18 September 2014,"The premise of this film was very intriguing to me, a one man show starring Ryan Reynolds in a box for around an hour and a half. Immediately it doesn't sound to engaging or even interesting but this film surprised me. The tone of isolation and frustration is felt immediately from the very first shot, or lack there of. This brings me to the most impressive aspect of the film, the cinematography. Truly impressive camera work was used in the production of this claustrophobic nightmare, 360 degree camera shots that had me wondering just how they accomplished such a task. Ryan Reynolds was fine in his performance as the captive man that we slowly piece together his back story and personality through phone calls via the great script. Yet I can't help but feel this role could have been played by any fairly talented actor who wanted to try something different. This isn't going against Ryan Reynolds but more the character himself, yet that is where the script perhaps fell short. Which means the reason this film is not getting higher praise from me is due to the feeling I had in the last 30 minutes of the narrative. While it had only been on for a short run time, I wanted it to end. It began to feel as though the narrative didn't know where is was going and just went round in circles, delaying the inevitable. However this film was very impressive yet one I feel won't be watched again by me in a long time and after the ending the film gives the audience, perhaps you can see why.",Buried
244,shreke2003,"An endless thrill ride, with one main actor.",10,15 August 2010,"I caught this gem at Sundance earlier in the year. It was part of the 'Park City at midnight' group of films, which showcased horror and thriller movies, and played them at, can you guess? Midnight. I saw Buried on the last night of the festival, Ryan Reynolds wasn't there, but both the director and writer were. It was a small theater on Main street, very artsy in it's look. But once the film started I had eyes only for the screen.It starts off with Ryan waking up, trapped in a box. A long box, the length of a human body, buried deep beneath the ground. From there the film plays out in an awe inspiring way, especially seeing as there's only so much you can reveal from one location. The way Rodrigo Cortes handled the filming is truly exceptional. From the start the camera switches between closely claustrophobic, and flying high above Ryan, showing the box with him inside and black all around. It's constantly on the move just like our main character's thoughts. Diving in when the action is intense, and then cutting to black when you don't think you can take any more.The pacing and plot of the film were nothing short of genius. And Chris Sparling, the writer, should be commended for his work. He said after the showing, that after having his scripts rejected for their cost of locations he decided to go for a cheep but genius idea. One location, one star, and a wealth of idea's. It makes a film like 'Salt' look like a giant waste of resources, when Buried does what even some of the best thrillers can't do, it brings us inside the character's head, and does it all without a romp through the city, or blowing things up.If you're one of those people who loves to sit on the edge of your seat, chewing at your fingernails, while you're constantly asking yourself what's going to happen next.

Now that it's here and I've seen it, I have never been so disappointed in a movie in my life! Suspense only works when there's rescue and a pay-off! Hitchcock-like in its opening music and spacing of tension,""Buried"" ends up as pointless as a mother who gives birth to a baby and then buries it in the back yard to all loss to her, where she and everyone around listens insensitively to it scream for a rescue, only to berate it for crying in distress and insisting it needs to calm down and change its attitude--baby whose loss of life she's paying for! Thirty years later, baby buried in its hole in the ground where Mama has left it is still crying to everyone in hearing distance to be saved--with no savior in sight and having been accused of deserving its abuse and neglect by everyone in a life just thrown away for no point!Atypical of anyone who has no helper that has been overtaken by an enemy and left good as dead, Ryan's character of Paul Conroy sufficiently wastes the first THIRTY minutes of the movie trying to use the cell phone he was left with to get someone in the world to hear and understand that his truck had been seized and him buried in a coffin somewhere he couldn't pinpoint underground--all the frustration of answering machines and no one home, hold calls, hangups, the fight with his what--mother- or sister-in law as he tried to learn his wife's whereabouts, disconnects and reconnects...before inevitable contact by the embezzler that had buried him with the phone on the heels of a hostage negotiator determined to find him out of thin air--literally--I should have known then: all that suspense--just for the ""call"" to be dropped at the end with no further reconnect.... And after his 'indecent' ""Proposal"" of a movie with Sandra Bullock last year, I'd thought Reynolds had come into his own with this one--but it looks like it just got buried in its dirt! Waste your time watching it and you're going to be the same--buried in a hole of a cemetery plot-line with no way to dig yourself out! I can't understand how it is that so many reviewers here have found it divine! Thus, successfully murdered by my hour and a half on this turkey of a before-Thanksgiving Dinner Cortés has served me for nothing, I'm going to get the life and blood pumping back into me by feasting on a reviewing of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz' high octane summer comedy romance suspense adventure thrill-ride ""Knight And Day.""

On that note hats off to Buried which is nothing like any film I've seen before.I'd heard Reynolds is very good in his role and he was, but he still couldn't resist the odd funny comment or jibe, which to be honest is a large part of his appeal in other films but personally I thought detracted from his part in this. Yes the funny lines got a giggle from the audience which I suppose warrants its place but in a film such as this I'm not sure if they were necessary? Couple this feeling with what I thought was a very poor soundtrack and I was left feeling like the film didn't take itself seriously enough. I guess what I'm trying to get across is that it was very American in its production.Now that's the only negative feeling out of the way I can mention the positives. Considering the film takes place solely in a box, the construction of a storyline is pretty well put together and does involve a few twists and turns along the way. The lighting is very good throughout and some of the shots really do get across the feeling of being trapped.A great film which, if it didn't try so hard to make up for the fact it was in a box, would possibly achieve a ten out of ten for thinking, ironically, out of the box.",Buried

258,IndecisivePigeon,Wow....,10,20 April 2011,"So, Buried is the story of US truck driver called Paul Conroy, who awakes in a wooden coffin. With no idea how he got there or why he is there, Paul finds a Blackberry and a Zippo and throughout the story he starts to piece together what has actually happened to him. Now, I'll start with the acting. In the past I haven't really rated Ryan Reynolds as an actor, I mean he was good in movies like Van Wilder and the usual when he is playing a cocky, confident lead. But In Buried, to see him, what I would call 'out of his element' He did a splendid job and was amazingly convincing. I thought that the way he portrayed the character of Paul Conroy was amazing, and at some points I felt like I was trapped in the coffin with him! When he was on the phone to his wife just as the coffin was getting buried really made my heart yearn for him!I loved the plot! I've seen a lot of people on here complain about it but I love the whole hostage situation, it reminded me of one of my favourite CSI episodes. Although there were some plot holes and mistakes, well what movies don't have them these days?! If your the type of person who doesn't really like movies with very little cast and movement then this obviously isn't for you, but please even if its not, give it a go!Now, for the extremely controversial ending. In fact, I loved this ending. I loved the fact that it wasn't one of those convenient happy Hollywood endings. *SPOILERS* I seriously thought that they would get Paul out of the coffin, Dan Brenner's sympathetic voice put me at some ease and made me assume that Paul would be found. Boy was I wrong! The end scene where Paul makes a phone call to his wife and believes that he is being dug up is heart wrenching, as the sand starts to build more and more, my tears started to pour and pour!

I was wrong. Never once was a bored watching this movie. I thought Ryan Reynolds did a great job, although his actions at times were quite stupid, but having said that, how would I behave in the same situation?*MINOR SPOILER WARNING*At one point, a snake gets into the coffin with Paul. It looks venomous. What would you do in this situation? If it got in, it can get out. Would you just stay still (as you should be anyway) and wait for it to move on, or would you break the glow stick thingy you found, splash some of the flammable liquid on the snake, then light it ON FIRE. Already he has very little oxygen. It was frustratingly stupid. I just had to vent on that.*END SPOILER*This is very low budget by Hollywood standards.

263,scorefax,i dont get the hype,1,25 December 2018,"Careful some spoilers!!!The only reason I watched this movie was the mainly positive reviews it got, but after watching it, I was solely disappointed.When I invest 95 minutes of my lifetime to watch a movie where the entire plot takes place in a coffin, I expect to be surprised, I expect some twists, some unexpected turns, etc. Otherwise you could actually just put someone in a coffin and film him until he dies.In this movie though things really just go bad one after another, I did not understand the whole snake thing and why he tries to burn everything after the snake crawled peacefully out of this pants and how it could just escape through that hole in the coffin, for me this is a logical mistake of the movie.Then at the end, we need some ""saw""-like action apparently, but since he cannot reach his foot in the coffin, he has to cut off one of his fingers, god knows why.And then the end is just weird, it may be different and unexpected, I'll give you that, but just because something is different and unexpected does NOT mean it is good or entertaining.For me this movie only serves one purpose and that is to immersively feel the claustrophobic panic and fear of death that comes by being buried alive, but for me that is just not entertaining. If that would be enough, we could make a thousand movies like that, where people are on a submarine and then drown, where people are in a burning building and then die, etc etc.",Buried

The acting is good.Some viewers enjoyed this movie, and I almost did by imagining how it would feel to be in the character's predicament and feeling enough empathy to strongly hope for success at every attempt to get rescued.You really may like it, but to me it is less interesting than ""Open Water"" in which two scuba divers were accidentally left in the ocean for many, many hours after their diving boat left.In each case, of course, the viewers want to know how the characters got in their predicament and what the outcome is, but the plot in between the beginning and finish of the film(s)seems like endless monotony.",Buried

That was what I thought as the end credits began to roll; my heart pacing and my breathing accelerated, I was left almost speechless at the boldness and sheer genius at what would be described as one of the best films of 2010. The scenario was realistic and suspenseful, the acting (i.e. actor Ryan Reynolds) was brilliant, and the directing was nothing short of amazing. It was a whole package and it was truly exciting to see what could be done with so little.The ending was unforgettable, and as they pulled the rug from under my feet, I literally found myself gasping for air with surprise and shock. Overall, the film delivered on every scale that I can think of and I find it sad that it didn't do so well in the box office, for if it had, it could have been quite the Oscar contender including Best Actor, Director, Cinematography, Screenplay, etc. I highly look forward to more films of this nature, to push the boundaries of the common film into something artistic.",Buried

275,jrwilson7,Don't hold your breath....,8,24 June 2011,"Solo character films have been done before and for some they can be a boring attempt at being ""artistic"" or ""art house"". The problem can be that having one character occupy the entire screen for 90+ minutes can ultimately be a boring exercise in doing everything possible to make the film interesting. And while the director is pulling every trick out of his hat to do that, you wind up not caring about the character. The film is only as good as the nuances of character the actor can bring to the role. Cast Away was a genuine attempt to make a successful film out of nothing remotely interesting, but Tom Hanks brought something more to the film. Moon, starring Sam Rockwell is probably the most valiant success, but the film rides on Sam's impeccable abilities as an actor (see Lawn Dogs, The Green Mile). Ryan Reynolds has not done much that would allow you to automatically assume he could carry a film all on his own. He's a great actor and has done a great many things. He's funny and good-looking which makes him perfect rom-com talent, but really, there is only a few films that he can hold up as being dramatically challenging (see Fireflies in the Garden, The Nines). Buried is a corker of a premise and relies on the innate human fear of being buried alive. Ryan is Paul, a contractor working as a truck driver in Iraq who is kidnapped and buried in a coffin. He has a mobile phone and 3 hours to get ransom money to be freed. Yeah, that's right, the whole film is Ryan Reynolds (that funny guy) stuck in a wooden box! The technical difficulties alone would have been a challenge. Yet the script, story and performance are remarkable. Think the suspense of a Hitchcock film jammed into the confines of a 6x4 coffin and you will have a good idea of the angst you will be feeling as you wait and hope for sunlight. Yet, when you burrow deeper down, the film is probably the most honest film I have seen about Iraq, although I hope much of its political comment is far from the truth. You see (spoiler alert), Paul is betrayed by everyone he comes to hope will rescue him. From his employer who terminates his employment from just before the incident, therefore relinquishing their responsibilities of protection and insurance, to the hostage team who are supposed to find him but end up lying to him, it's a roller-coaster of emotions that are compounded by the claustrophobic confines of a wooden box. Paul can only communicate by using a mobile which has been left on his person and as much as it is his link to possible safety it's also the link to the terrorists who have taken him hostage. It's through the phone that we learn the best and worst about Paul himself but also the situation he finds himself in. What works well are the technical aspects of the film which really help create a suffocating environment. The only light is artificial and either bathes Paul in yellow or blue and every time the light goes out, we are presented with a black screen which in itself is not a common production element to use, but here is works. To be presented with darkness, even ten seconds of it, feels like eternity and you are holding your breath with each passing moment. Every close up of Ryan's face reveals the terror and emotion of the moment and as much as the close up is used, it's hard to tire of it when what your being given is a powerful and heart wrenching performance. Director Rodrigo Cortes stretches out the elastic band as far as it will go, then, it simply snaps. He's certainly proved he is a great director.Buried is a mesmerising, breathtaking psychological drama with an A- grade performance from Ryan Reynolds. Don't hold your breath... for anything good to come of this.",Buried
276,rainbowijij,Tears spilled down my face,9,12 April 2011,"I just finished watching this, I cried. I was just so naive that believing there would be a happy ending. At the beginning, I thought this film was annoying as audiences are being blind all the time, the light from the lighter made me very uncomfortable watching it. Expecting thriller, like many teens, I thought it was so boring at the first 30 minutes. Even at the middle of the film, I wanted to stop watching as I couldn't see any surprise from it. But as I continued, I found myself struggling for hope just like Paul.From every call Paul made, I could see how hopeless a man was when being trapped in a coffin facing death. I don't think I will have such courage to stand till the end if I were Paul. He got a cellphone, a lighter, some fluorescence sticks, a pen, pills, a bottle of wine and little hope. Each time he hit a mailbox I wanna say:""damn god, not this again!"" I even felt depressed for him. I was really mad hearing Dan speaking. Everything he told Paul was useless, he even told lies. He gave hope to a dying man which it did not exist. How pathetic! I m not an American and I don't know how the government departments work there. But it seems helpless to people with a situation like Paul. oh ya, and that CRT company, they couldn't be more despicable!!(excuse me, I was just having too much sympathy for Paul.)Cutting the contract at a moment like that? Especially when they did that in an official tone, they were so mean indeed.Other than the story itself, directing, filming, acting are very good, single setting with the only man though, the mood was so right. You can feel the fear and darkness.At the end of the movie, I knew it. When Dan told Paul at phone that they were about to find him, I knew that must not be Paul but someone else. Dying in despair couldn't make me cry, but Paul was hoping being rescued, even with his last breath. My tears couldn't stop spilling down my face and I was just crying like a little girl. This is too sad, very sad indeed. At the time Paul died, he even needed to face the truth that Mark White was a lie and Mark was actually the one seeing the light again but not him. My heart felt like being ripped.This is a worth-watching movie, recommend to those who are wasting their life, treasure your every hope and breath, cause you don't know when will you lose it.

277,toygun_999,"Next time use the knife, moron.",1,15 June 2011,"I can't understand what point this unrealistic twaddle ""movie"" tried to make other than the usual silly propaganda nonsense; the screen writer want us to believe that there are ""innocent"" American ""truck drivers"" being kidnapped and buried alive, and even their families back home are also a target by ""starving Iraqi family"" (or a ""terrorist"")- sorry, that BS doesn't happen, well, except to Iraqis.First of, when the moron protagonist saw a snake enter (and come out) his miserable box why he didn't think? He got a knife and then the fact snakes don't dwell under ground unless there is an animal made tunnel/den next to his box: which is a good sign.Second, the moron heard the call for prayer (oh, that overused cliché again) which means he got to be less than couple of feat under ground, yet all he does is waste more oxygen and shout at a Blue-Berry cell phone, like an idiot that he was.Third, learn Arabic next time, so you can save time using and shouting at the cell phone. You are in Iraq, not the US, you miserable moron.Fourth, a canteen filled with water at the beginning of the movie suddenly it becomes vodka(?) Which he used to drive the snake out by trying to set it on fire. He should allowed the snake to put him out of his stupid misery instead.The only redeeming scene is when he labeled his kidnapper a ""terrorist"", but the latter replied something like so: ""I'm a terrorist? You are terrorized, so I'm a terrorist? But me and my family is being killed and terrorized by your occupation soldiers, so you (Americans) are not considered terrorists?""All in all just a bad piece of garbage trying to make a pointless point.

Paul (Reynolds) has a handful of items buried with him, including a phone which he uses for the majority of the film in his efforts to reach help. I generally enjoy watching simple thrillers like this, however Buried was a disappointment.We join Paul as he wakes up, follow him throughout his predicament, and share the tedium and frustration that you might imagine comes with the situation. So in that sense the film is a success. But for a thriller, it's not very thrilling. Any genuine excitement is replaced with a generic humming soundtrack and the attempts at misdirection are clichéd and easy to spot for anyone familiar with thrillers or horrors. On the topic of clichés the dialogue on the phone is full of them, including ""Did you get the flowers I sent you"", aimed at his elderly mother who seems to have dementia.Looking back, I wonder what else I might have expected in a film about a man in a box. Perhaps a character study with more realism would have been an improvement, with an absence of a soundtrack or the writer's efforts to engage the audience, such as a set piece with a snake, which just seems forced. While being only 90 minutes the film still felt too long, so maybe it would have worked better as a short.",Buried

289,jgrizzle358,This Movie Will Make You Hate The Government,8,18 January 2011,"What would you do if you work up buried alive in a coffin, with nothing but a lighter, and a cell phone?Ryan Reynolds delivers a fantastic performance in this exact situation. In the movie, Reynolds plays Paul, a truck driver who was delivering supplies to Iraq when his truck was attacked by some Iraqis. He wakes up 2 hours later in a coffin, buried 3 feet underground, with naught but a lighter and a cell phone. And this is where the movie begins.For a movie that was shot entirely in a coffin, this was done pretty well. There's only one actor we see the entire movie, and that's Ryan, all the others are just voices on the phone. But it doesn't take away from the movie's feel. If anything, it adds to it. The entire movie being shot in a dark coffin, makes for a kind of... claustrophobic atmosphere. They wanted the viewers to feel how the actor was feeling. The understand his panic. To sense his fear. So, the audience stays with the actor the entire movie. he never gets a breath of fresh air, so why should we? The screen doesn't change to his wife being worried, or the FBI at their computers trying to trace his cell phone. No. It stays inside the coffin for the whole ride. and that's good. That's how it should be. It adds to the suspense.There were multiple parts of the movie that aggravated me, not because they were bad, or didn't make sense, but because they involved phone calls to government offices, who seem (not surprisingly) more interested in money and avoiding publicity than a man's life. Now, being a man who hates the government already, I can honestly say this movie did nothing to change that. If anything, it made my feelings towards them that much worse. Because I just know, in real life, they would do the same thing.Moving on to the acting. Ryan did a fantastic job. He portrayed the character's fear and panic quite well, and also, the moments of hysteria were done beautifully. There were also moments of sadness, and God help you if you don't cry during those moments. Overall he was brilliant, especially for being alone in the movie. And having nothing more than voices to play off of.As for the violence, there was none. Which is extremely surprising for a Lisongate movie. The worst thing about this movie is the claustrophobic feeling. Besides that there's one scene with a snake that might freak some people out, and a scene involving bodily dismemberment, but it happens off screen, so you don't see anything. This movie is more of a suspense thriller than anything.It was refreshing to see a thriller that didn't use gore or scare tactics. This was good old fashioned ""mess with your head"" type thriller that forces you to keep your eyes glued to the screen the whole time wondering what will happen to the character. You feel his fear, you feel his sadness, you feel his anger. You wish you could just jump right in there and save him yourself. The movie does a very good job of pulling you in.It's hard to find any complaints about this movie, but if I had to, there'd only be two. The beginning, and the ending. The beginning because it is so prolonged and over done. And the ending because... well, I'm writing a spoiler-free review so I'll just say it just wasn't what I expected.

I can't even find words to describe it. One, it has Ryan Reynolds as pretty much the main/only actor, and he's gorgeous. Secondly, the whole movie just keeps you guessing. With 127 hours & wrecked also coming out around the same time, all with pretty much the same story line, this one was the best. Thirdly, the ending will have you in an awe. Hardly ever happens that an ending to a movie has such an impact on you. 127 did, but not in any sort of way this movie does.

However, my expectations were immediately exceeded as the films storyline progressed and the plot thickened. My anticipation and anxiety for the protagonist's fate got deeper and deeper as each minute went by.Ryan Reynolds gave a spectacular performance as panic stricken Paul Conroy. As he was the only actor seen in person, the success of the movie lie in Ryan Reynolds' hands. This was a risky gamble from director Rodrigo Cortes but one that certainly paid off. Ryan Reynolds' performance was mesmerising and had me biting my nails in anticipation the whole way throughout the film. Buried is a unique film that exceeded my expectations in every way and left me shaken and stirred for hours after the riveting end scene.",Buried

Waking up in darkness, realizing the horror you have ended up in, then some light, some hope and then... well, then Hollywood kicked in.After the first twenty or so minutes, the script goes down the drain. Humans in desperate situtions fight for their lives with every fibre of there existence. They claw, scratch and fight for their lives, they follow every glimpse of hope, conserve and value every little resource they have to survive. In Buried the victim doesn't. There are just too many totally unrealistic things going on in Buried, the tense atmosphere created in the first part dissipated quickly and made this movie close to unbearable. There were moments when I was ready to leave the theatre - not because of the tension but because if those ridiculous things happening in the box while obviously the scriptwriter was running out of ideas. The ending just as most of the movie disappointed in every respect.I am sad to say Buried could have been one hell of a movie... but turned out to be utterly disappointing.",Buried

What made me think like that was the casting of Ryan Reynolds. I don't know who the director is but I'm guessing he's not one of Hollywood's MTV bitches because this film happily does not play the 'formula' game.Credit must also go to the writer who manages to say a few truths without losing sight of the arc within a very confined stage.But, mostly, credit goes to Mr Reynolds whose presence presumably got this project its green light & subsequent profile.I have two ways of reviewing this film. Firstly, as a Hollywood popcorn movie: it pleasingly teases then disappoints. Secondly, as a philosophical & sociological commentary, it deserves warm applause.I know that sounds pretentious but the fact is this film manages to sustain tension with one visible actor lying in a box for 90mins which makes it remarkable. And, its nihilism is a Hard Truth that Hollywood normally berates as heretic. For that, this film is brave.Not necessarily a date movie but I'd recommend existentialist thinkers to see it.",Buried

Paul Conroy, a US contractor working in Iraq, awakes in a dark box buried in dessert with only a lighter and a cellphone. The experience is totally catastrophic leaving him with no option but to accept his fate in a softly killing tragedy. From the beginning until the end, its all about helpless struggle with no little hope nor anything that helps the character to escape from the horrible situation. It mirrors reality in a way that people are so cold and insensitive. > Terminating a contract between Paul Conroy and CRT upon learning that he is in trouble- to escape from any obligation that Paul is involved with. > The government and paul negotiation things are useless bullsh*t! - thats how the government play with people, after using them, you are thrown like a piece of garbage.

I went into this movie not knowing what to expect at all. All I knew was that it was about Ryan Reynolds waking up in a coffin. And he is the only person you ever see. Rodrigo Cortes and the script writer are brilliant in finding enough things to occur within the small confines of a coffin to keep you on the edge of your seat. The ending is specifically designed to make you go ""WHAT?!!"" and I'm sure some will hate the movie for it but I thought it was clever, or as one reviewer wrote - diabolically clever.I recommend this to anyone looking around for a good thriller and to anyone who has a slight tinge of claustrophobia just so you can see how far you can make it through the movie.Well done!",Buried

The movie starts with-in the coffin, Ryan wakes up and finds himself inside with few options like a cell phone (blackberry), lighter and few flash lights. Rest of the story remains in coffin through-out till the end. The story also reveals the true nature of organizations and governments during the process.

Paul Conroy doesn't sound like the guy you would want in your circle of acquaintances, much less care about him. I mean, who says F you to someone who just gave you a life saving number, keeps using the lighter when all the common sense and even another person tells him not to, doesn't try to find how deep underneath the ground he is by trying to open the snake crack wider? And he stays on the phone for too long with no potential results. At the end, you think you'd probably not even want him alive. I shouted at the screen and left the movie once, but my wife wanted to finish it, and even she didn't like it by the end.

303,xamsx,Buried,8,21 April 2011,"Buried is a picture that I missed during it's limited theatrical release and one I have only recently managed to see; I am now just more disappointed I didn't see it at the cinema. From a technical outlook, this film is astounding. Shot in just 17 days and in chronological sequence, you share every terrified breath with the only man you see on screen, Paul Conroy, portrayed magnificently by Ryan Reynolds. His limited light resources (initially a zippo lighter and phone) are the only ones the audience are privy to and as such, they have to be used in increasingly inventive ways. Due to the action never leaving the wooden box, there are plenty of other techniques used to keep you captivated. Take for instance the fact that no one shot is repeated in the entire 94 minute run time, which by the way, is the real time of the events themselves. To achieve this, 7 different coffins were used, enabling the director to think up some incredibly cunning shots. As you can imagine, if you never see another person on screen for an hour and a half, that person needs to be engaging in a manner of ways. Ryan Reynolds is somebody I have personally liked and held a high opinion of for a few years now. Whilst a lot of his work is usually more light and breezy, something that he does well, I think this film will open the eyes of many, to the talents this guy has. Portraying a wealth of emotions from panic through to anger and despair, I was never once anything but convinced that I was watching a man buried alive. The physical demands he put himself through are admirable as well, reportedly enduring multiple burns from the lighter and severe joint and muscle pains from being prostrate and contorting himself for such long periods.This is the bravest film I've seen in a long time, both in content and execution. I was anxious about watching it as I thought it may set off my claustrophobia, but even though it made me uncomfortable, it was so engaging and brutally intense that it was marginal.And besides, it's a dude buried in a coffin, you're supposed to feel claustrophobic.",Buried
304,Trojanic,7.8/10,8,16 November 2011,"An American truck driver working in Iraq awakens to find himself buried in a wooden box with only a torch, lighter and mobile at his disposal. Now, I will admit I was a bit apprehensive about Buried knowing that Ryan Reynolds (Paul) was the one man cast; after all, he's just a rom- com actor... right? Not anymore! Ryan Reynolds gives an emotional and believable performance over the 90+ minutes of this movie drawing you in and making you feel every anxious second with him.The highlight for me is that Buried doesn't attempt to be anything other than what it is. It would have been easy for the director, Rodrigo Cortés, to have included a lot more action into the film by also focusing on the actions of all those involved outside of Pauls coffin, however the decision to only focus on his situation helps to make this one of the most gripping and suspense filled movies I have seen. Sometimes it pays to think inside the box!If you're looking for a film to blow you out of your seats with lots of action, CGI, camera trickery then do not see this movie. If you want a raw, gritty, tense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat with anticipation then this is the movie for you. For those that enjoyed Phone Booth, 127 hours.

Buried underground in a wooden box, we see Paul Conroy face these obstacles in an all too real way. Fully immersed by both compelling cinematography and superb sound design, we are subjected to the horrors of this claustrophobic catastrophe right along side the films only embodied character as he searches for answers and fights for his freedom.I won't say too much more about the plot or the themes, other than I believe the writer struck many a chord that resonated with Americans circa 2010 and even today.I encourage you to set aside an uninterrupted 90 minutes and watch this movie by yourself, in the dark with the best sound system you can find, whether that is a home theater or a good pair of headphones.

It really stuck with me though. I've been thinking about it for hours, even after watching 2 other movies I turned the TV off and found myself crying again thinking of Ryan Reynolds. He plays this part so amazingly well, and goes through all the emotions you'd expect. Anger, grief, denial, depression, the first acceptance, a small bit of hope and then finally the most broken acceptance he could've had. This movie isn't a happy movie. It's not a hopeful movie. It's not a movie you'd expect to see. It's unbearably realistic, in the sense that this is exactly what would've happened to him. I spent the entire last half hour of the movie waiting for them to find him. I felt his hope. I felt his pain. I felt his grief. I felt everything he did, and that is truly an accomplishment when I'm sitting in my living room watching a screen. The little 'finding him' scene where he daydreams for a few seconds that he's been rescued didn't do too much at the time, I just accepted that it was a daydream, but once I finished the movie looking back at it leaves me with even more sadness. This movie kills me in the best way possible, and I believe everyone should see it.",Buried

I especially enjoyed the part where the guy from the FBI asked him what his social security number was. Thus, this aspect of the film was quite well done. Sadly, the movie degrades from here. He was told that since he has a cellular signal he could only be buried a couple of feet underground, which at the end makes me wonder....why didn't he make a break for it when the coffin cracked? Also, he had a knife and there were several holes in the side of his coffin, why didn't he try and pry them off? or even better, tray and pry out a board on the bottom, in which case he could dig himself out. But no, it seems like a much better use of your time to call people who aren't there and yell and scream. Using your zippo and burning up all your oxygen is also a GREAT idea...(especially when you have glow sticks, a flashlight, and a cellphone).As far as I'm concerned though, the biggest let down was the ending. I mean, who didn't see that coming? A lot of people on here seem to think it was some kind of masterpiece of suspense. While I was watching it I just kept thinking to myself, I bet you it's going to be the wrong grave...So this movie is something you can watch if you're bored and there isn't really anything else on (or if you're tired of watching good movies over again).",Buried

Next, I filled my Zippo lighter full and compared it with the performance of HIS Zippo lighter. After a few minutes the lighter will become so hot that you can't hold it. He holds his much of the time. There is NO WAY a Zippo can give you that robust of a flame for the length of time that he uses it. Not only that, seems that for an hour and a half he really didn't show signs of fatigue with the small amount of oxygen he had in the coffin. He was not only using that oxygen to breath but to start a fire as well... not to mention the flame of the lighter using it up. Also, if they spent 3 million making this movie, what did they spend the money on? It would be interesting to know.

As it turned out I was wrong on both counts! Brief summary:Ryan is a contract driver in Iraq whose vehicle is attacked by Iraqis. He wakes up in a coffin buried underground with a few ""helpful"" tools...and so ensues a claustrophobic, frustrating and scary journey for both the character and the audience! I found Ryan's performance quite compelling and was almost living the experience with him, I even found myself holding my breath at times and feeling quite panicky! The fact that you can't see what is going on above ground adds to the tension and you are never quite sure what to believe.I also found this a thought provoking film on another level. It's very easy to immediately dismiss the hostage takers as ""the baddies"" but I think this is a very shallow and naive view of human nature. It made me think, that transcending race, religion and nationality, what would any human be capable of doing in the their situation. These are sometimes hard working law abiding people who have seen their country torn apart by war, who have seen their children dying and who no longer have any other way of making money, and who see the Americans as to blame for this....not that I want to sound like I was on their side at all or that I condone it in any way, which I don't, but I found this film a very interesting study into human survival instinct and desperation.A very good film, probably the best thing out at the moment, along with The Town, and definitely worth the ticket price.And to the reviewer that felt this was a 95 minute terrorist propaganda movie, shame on you!

As this unarmed truck driver, working for a non- military contract in Iraq, wakes up from his unconsciousness, he finds himself trapped in a wooden coffin placed somewhere deep in the desert. The chances of being rescued from this traumatic situation is, needless to say, minor. Following the truck driver's numerous attempts to get in contact with the outside world ( yes, his perpetrator where kind enough to provide him a cell phone) his chances of surviving is declining by the minute. All the scenes throughout the movie are solidly secluded to this poor victim in the coffin, however, that only enhances the horrific tension. The acting is thoroughly convincing even though only one actor is starring whom most of the times, manages to produce monologues characterised with guttural sounds that are stained with fear. Despite sitting comfortably in a neat sofa while watching this movie, the pulse keeps raising in the same way as if one was working out at a gym. Seldom has the old saying ""The hope is the last thing that leaves you"" been so excellently depicted in a story that makes any horror fan fear their own death.",Buried

That being said, I leave being bias in the locker to the best of my ability.This film does a good job creating a claustrophobic nightmare and that is something I can not deny. If you have claustrophobia avoid this film unless you enjoy being freaked out. The camera work in such a small space is worth seeing just for the sake of it, however, you don't need to watch more than 15 min of the film to gather the extent of what they do with the space offered. Acting, both voice and physical is not Oscar worthy but not painful enough to turn the film off. Sound, good enough to establish the location and the things happening. The bads, and oh there are many, is there is not enough music, don't care what anyone says. Yes, I understand, they wanted to pull you into his situation of being trapped BUT, BUT, music would have helped and greatly increased the empathy felt for the main character if done correctly. He tries to kill himself with fire, second most horrible way to go and a great way to drain the oxygen when he could have simply used one of the nails to cut his wrist and go an easy way. There is no other location shot...sorry, this is horrible. ONE shot outside, just a simple zoom out from the top of the ground above him with him screaming would have established a great deal of drama and suspense AS WELL as give the viewer a break from the never ending boxy environment. Hour and half of oxygen after using a lighter and attempting to burn himself makes it hard to know if the film is being at all accurate in possibilities or if they are being moronic. He, himself, is a dumb character. The burning himself alive is idiotic enough to make it seem like he deserves death when there were plenty of ways he could have killed himself. Final bad; the ending is crap. You know from the start he is in a really crap-tastic situation that is being passed up as near impossible to get out of. After an hour and half you discover...spoiler...you have wasted your time and managed to be right, he was screwed. This easily leaves you going ""why did I watch this?"" ""Fantastic, I watched a movie with next to hope just to find out he, as a character, doesn't evolve, the situation hardly changes (weak plot points) and it is all for nothing.

324,Ltrgman,"Zero thrills, but lots of utter stupidity.",1,26 December 2010,"Buried has an interesting concept to work with... man stuck in buried coffin, limited supplies and oxygen... yadda yadda yadda. But the filmmakers decided to make the story and the protagonist (Ryan Reynolds) dumb as bricks, which basically tanks the movie. There are so many flaws in Buried that it's beyond irritating and makes you demand your 95 minutes back; from the constant use of a lighter when there's supposedly limited oxygen, to the inability of the protagonist to stay calm for one second and figure out an escape plan instead of shouting into a cell phone from beginning to end. Any thrills or intrigue are quickly stifled by the aforementioned poor writing and trademark Ryan Reynolds school of douchebaggery acting.127 Hours was another 2010 movie that had a guy stuck in a tough situation where survival seemed impossible. But the protagonist in that one actually survives because he was resourceful and tough as nails. Throughout, the movie is thrilling and really takes you on an emotional and sensory roller coaster. However, the thing that is really ironic is that 127 Hours is a TRUE STORY. The filmmakers of this fictional trite that is Buried couldn't even come up with a story that is more interesting than what happens in the real world. The point of many fictional movies is to take you out of the realms of reality, like an escape. Buried not only doesn't do that, there are also no thrills or excitement. Even if the movie was supposed to be more grounded in reality, it fails at that as well.",Buried

328,offaroundthebend,Apparently for mature audiences only..,7,27 January 2011,"Buried seems to be a very divisive film. I'm seeing lots of 1 star reviews, and lots of 8-10 star reviews.**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**I won't rehash the plot, as every other review seems to. I will say that the movie is extremely taut, claustrophobic, well-paced and tense, and that at every step you will believe that this man - who has woken up buried alive - is desperate to survive and is trying to come up with a possibility of escape.The reason that this movie is getting so many 1 star reviews is because it is REALISTIC. Yes, REALISTIC.I imagine most of the reviewers giving it low scores are viewers who don't yet have the maturity to face up to a hopeless situation. Most movies these days give the hero impossible odds to overcome, and he DOES overcome them... because it's a movie. In real life impossible odds means that you fail, you lose. Say goodbye.Well, the odds are impossible in this movie. The main character wakes up in a box with almost zero mobility. The air supply is limited. He has only a lighter and a mobile phone (initially). He is in a foreign country, with no knowledge of his precise location. It is a nightmare situation. The odds are practically impossible. Yet we do believe that survival is possible. No, we almost DEMAND it. We hope and we pray that he will get out of that box. We empathise completely with his situation, but we believe there must be a way out.And that is why the movie is garnering such a mixed response. He doesn't get out. It was doomed from the start. He's been put in there by men who don't give a damn whether he survives or not. By men who've killed other innocent people and will continue to do so because their country is war torn and they are angry and desperate. His only hope is the US government and a hostage working group, whom he communicates with by phone. Every conversation is an exchange of information, with Reynolds's character offering whatever information he can in exchange for vague promises of help, and the various people on the other end of the phone having their own agendas and needs. But ultimately what can they do? His location is unknown and his phone is untraceable. They're looking for a needle in a dusty haystack. He can't get himself out and they can't find him to get him out.Read all of the 1 star reviews for comments like ""why didn't the guy just use the knife to dig himself out?"" and ""he wastes oxygen using the zippo for light, what an idiot"". He doesn't use the knife because every crack in the box lets sand in, and without the manoeuvrability to stand up, he would increase the speed at which he is buried. Remember, he cannot sit up, reach past his thighs, or even lift his head all the way up. And he uses the zippo for light because the alternative is to save oxygen while sitting there in the dark waiting for death. Action requires the use of resources, but only action gives the hope for success. Everyone seems to criticise his actions but I haven't yet seen a plausible escape plan offered up. If you're the type of person who thinks that if you were buried alive you would simply one-inch-punch your way out Kill Bill style then you're not going to like Buried. It's as simple as that, because your solution is fantasy and you will have no interest in seeing how such a situation would actually play out.This movie is about THE CHARACTER's choices. It's about what HE chooses to do for survival. If the viewer has the wisdom to accept the reality of the situation presented, and the understanding that this isn't some safe video game puzzle but rather a man's struggle to not die alone in a box somewhere in Iraq then they will find this movie hauntingly powerful.If you only want happy endings and the overcoming of impossible odds then you will probably hate this film. It will upset your delicate notion that life is sparkly and everything works out for the best. You will probably give it 1 star and explain how you would have killed the snake, cut off it's tail and used it as a hose to breathe through. But one thing's for sure: it will get under your skin and it will evoke a REACTION from you. And isn't that what good cinema is about anyway? See this film. You might hate it. But at least it will make you THINK.",Buried
329,chasabi,Utterly Disappointed.,5,5 November 2014,"My first review for a long time. I just had to express my opinion on this one because I was so disappointed with it.As many people have mentioned in other reviews... he has limited oxygen yet he is constantly using a lighter and using oxygen by shouting and screaming down the phone at people. Surely he would've suffocated half way through the film.The story is slightly interesting and it kept me engaged enough that I wanted to see how it ended but I've seen films that are worse hence the 5/10 rating. The concept is very good but it could've been done with greater intelligence. Why the hell was he using the lighter to look at a phone with a back-lit screen?! There was also a few clichés. For example, the lighter runs out of fuel just as he has given up and records his last will and testament. What are the odds of that happening! In summary, a very good concept is let down by plot holes, a dumb, annoying character and a crappy ending.",Buried
330,jorgenmolijn,"Simple, but a very effective plot",8,7 December 2010,"I saw the movie yesterday with a friend of mine. Both of us were expecting a movie which primarily uses 1 room (in this case the coffin) in combination with several flashbacks. However, we were wrong and although that might have seem a bit boring to have an entire movie in just one room, it works. It adds up to the frustration and fear of Conroy. As a viewer, you know just as much as Conroy does. Also the persons on the other side of the phone, you don't see them. However you can still get a clear idea of who they are just from the phone calls. That's pretty difficult to do for a filmmaker. I just don't get why some people don't like this movie at all. I also expected that Conroy would die, but the way the movie ended was still surprising. Some critic the way they shot the movie, that is was a bit to small or anything and that you can't get a clear view. But that's the whole point, you need to get the feeling that you are inside the coffin so you can relate to Conroy. An other point of criticism was that it didn't have a happy ending. Who cares about that... Endings like these and The Mist are so much stronger than a fairy tail ending.",Buried

""How can you do a movie like this and keep it interesting?"".Let's think as the guy would for a minute: ""Hey, I'm buried in a wooden box. What could be worse?"". Well, everything can be worse. What if it was radical islamists that put you there? In Irak? The originality just stuns me. Of course, when I said radical islamists I meant bad guys that hate humanity (and everything for that matter).What could you add to the mix? Why not some incompetent state workers that also act like typical white guys from a TV drama? ""Come on, we know you're there, but we're the American Government and we don't want to help you because we're bad and we don't care about people"".After that, the fact that he uses the stuff he has in the opposite way he should and the fact that snakes come out of nowhere and can break through wood walls only add to the formula. A different concept turns into a predictable movie.So, maybe there's a part 2. Why not including a superhero now? A rescue mission that includes killing terrorists sounds like a job for John Rambo.

Then the lighter...why can't he stop using it and use the other stuff in his bag or the cellphone light..??.well i'd say it's to make the visual effect a bit nicer and more original... and if u watch the movie correctly u do see that he stops using it several times either to think without any light or to use the light thing from his bag..or the cellphone..Why can't he call someone that can help him ??well who do u want him to call except government?he did call his beloved ones, then he gets transferred several times..what else u want from him!!!he doesn't know where he is how u want him to make it easier to his correspondents(even tho they don't give a rats ass).For those who say he's dumb and stupid..he is buried alive!!!

343,vmrkarvalho,"Good try, but...",7,10 January 2012,"It's an ambitious film, I'll give them that. It's a great idea and it works in so many levels but it's almost ruined by the same things that make it original. I'll try to break it down for you.Making a film using a coffin as the only set is an incredibly hard thing to do, and Rodrigo Cortés was able to master that particular challenge. The camera work is amazing and fresh during the whole time, witch is pretty hard, given the situation. The directing is very good in doing an almost impossible work.Ryan Reynolds is also amazing in the movie, giving it so much with so few resources. He actually builds a character INSIDE a coffin and makes us connect with him and feel his suffering.Other aspects, like editing, sound and cinematography are also very competent, rising up to the challenge.Having said that, it almost seem like this would be a perfect movie. But the most important thing in a movie is a script. And this one... Well, it has is good moments, sure, especially in terms of ""killing time"" (in a good way). The film never stops and builds up constantly until the end. But there's so many things you can do, in this kind of film and, as time passes, the narrative just gets a little dumb, to be honest. There's to many twists (unnecessary ones) and, as time goes by, they get worse just to try to keep it up and shock a little more. I won't spoil anything but the ending just ruins the whole film. I understood the message they wanted to deliver, but, if they wanted to go there, they should have though about a better way to do it. See it a judge it for yourself.It was a nice try and, as I said, it worked on a lot of levels. But it was all to cover up a incoherent script with to many flaws. And that kills it.

346,billie_wongt4,Survival Instincts of a Panda...but fun!,8,30 September 2010,"I just got back from a screening of this little gem of a film. The title says it all and the fact that the title is so simple and straightforward parallels the ethos of this film. The film is only simple in the fact that there is only one visible character during the 90 minute running time and there are no elaborate sets, special effects or lighting. But just thinking of how much planning had to go into the making of this film just to make it seem so claustrophobic and simplistic gets my mind whirling. The other reviews say enough about how good it is. I'll just focus on some shortcomings.Ryan Reynolds did a stand-up job as the protagonist of this film. He's lovable, but almost too lovable; given how prickly his character is supposed to be (the back-story from his interaction with other characters sheds some light on this). I cannot fault his acting one bit: his breathing picks up pace at just the right moments (I loved the slow-burn of the intro), his sweat is believable, and his tears come just at the right moments. His frustration is palatable. However, I do think that Ryan may have been miscast. He's an affable guy and very articulate (must be the Canadian upbringing), so it's hard for me to fathom that he's just a truck driver with $700 in his savings account and a troubled marriage. Being as sharp as he comes across, some of his actions while trapped inside the box really jerks me back to reality and takes me away from the film. The man has the survival instincts of a panda. There were quite a few 'groan' moments for me peppered throughout the film. One is when another 'character' is introduced and how it is dispensed of quickly. One is how bristly he is when speaking with people that are his only lifeline. I understand he's under a lot of pressure, but then he often has quick little quips that escape his lips which belie his true state of mind (which also serves to rouse a good chuckle from the audience). Those inconsistencies make me believe that the movie fell short of its potential. There were some gimmicks along the way as well (why would he be instructed to do things, but so easily be distracted and no one follows up? Why would he be so concerned about a zippo lighter eating his oxygen, but later do something as elaborate and irresponsible as X later on? Isn't his mother's condition a bit beyond her years (unless Reynolds was her 8th child)? Why does he switch his phone back to vibrate (sure, you can say he's 'given up', but his actions after that prove otherwise)? Why does the camera strangely pan out a couple of times throughout the film (was his mind drifting? I'll never know what the director intended. All I know is that it took me outside of the confined space)? Why would he stay on the phone with the HR guy? Why would he explain his situation to everyone except the one individual that he personally knows and can help him and constantly repeat ""I don't have time to explain..."". I personally really hate that line. In that time, the character almost always has time to convey his thoughts, but chooses not to; just to introduce confusion and mayhem. )Reynolds' character, in my mind, should have been some overweight, aging truck driver from the South - just some average Joe - not some strapping, handsome, intelligent young man with a bright future. But I guess I wouldn't watch a movie about some fat, aging man from the South who's just some 'average Joe' - so I guess the casting was deliberate. It's just so implausible. But hey, who am I to judge? I'd probably loose several thousand brain cells after being hit on the head with a rock and being trapped with little oxygen under the sand in a little box.The last 10 minutes of the film were pretty brilliant. You definitely feel time running out, like the sand through an hourglass, the sand is filling his death trap (which was a brilliant device introduced 1/2 way through, if I might add). Sure, there were a few gimmicks in there to get things really going, but you expect that. And sure, things like that can happen. I'll buy it. The tension just kept building. I had hoped they would milk it for a few extra seconds, but that probably wouldn't have been feasible. You're basically hoping against hope that something will come through in the end, right there alongside him.Overall, this was a tight movie. Reynolds is incredible and the atmosphere created by the director and his team is bang-on. However, if you're not one to get really invested in a film you're watching, then you won't 'get' this film either. There were quite a number of plot devices, but they would have been excused if Reynolds were not cast - but I guess it's just really the case of a director and writer wanting everything, but sometimes, it just doesn't work that way for the viewer (for me at least). My SO watching beside me at no time bought the idea that Reynolds was even stuck inside a box, so they didn't really care WHAT happened to him in the end. My SO said that they didn't want to see a movie about an average person making dumb decisions. I guess SO's right - it's a lot more interesting making a movie about a smart person in a situation, but then again, it's also much harder. So, if you get really upset when people have the survival instincts of a panda, maybe this one isn't for you either. You just have to suspend disbelief for 90 minutes. If you can, you'll enjoy it.",Buried

If you want to see a movie that keeps you guessing all the way and keeps you at the edge of the seat BURIED is the answer. Wow what a movie. Buried is the excellent piece of cinema I have seen from a long time. How to maximize the output with minimum input BURIED is the excellent example of it. Yes minimum input in the sense that only one man appear on the screen and whole of the story takes place in the coffin itself.... yes you read it right coffin. It is an excellent example how a gripping story and a wonderful screenplay can do. Filming a film on extravagant locations and eye catching scenes can fail if the story and screenplay doesn't deliver. Now coming on to the story Ryan Reynolds suddenly wakes up in coffin buried under the ground and he is with a lighter and a cell phone and with 90 min of oxygen. How he get there? What he has done to suffer like this? How will he survive? Will he get out? What he will do with lighter and cell phone? These all are the questions that you will ask to yourself while watching this movie. Interesting fact is that with every minute you can expect twist and turns. And I bet you, you won't be able to predict them. Now talking about the acting and performance there is not much to talk as there is only one actor on the screen throughout the film and that is Ryan Reynolds but he has given a terrific performance A performance of his lifetime. Words can't do justice to his performance. Inside the coffin his performance is just brilliant. His facial expression his emotions are just perfect. Even in this coffin he goes through every emotion possible like pain, frustration, happiness, sorrow, anger, hatred. His performance is one of the best performance as he depicts all these emotions as he is really trapped in coffin. Camera work is at its level best. As you know this story takes place inside a coffin buried under the ground so camera work has to be its level best because story telling has to be done through camera. But I can say that camera is the second hero in this movie first one is of course Ryan. When I first heard of the film I thought how many twist and turn can a story take inside a coffin but I am really amazed to see there were many twists and turns in this movie. I bet you nobody can predict what will happen next. Every scene comes with a great surprise. Yes I feel ending could have been different but that is what this film is all about it never goes as you expect it to go. To sum up I feel this is one of the best movies made in recent time and everyone who is a cinema lover should see this and praise it. So it is highly recommended... A must see...My Rating 10 out of 10 **********",Buried
349,xelagbs,Beyond disappointing,1,17 December 2010,"I have seen many reviews on IMDb of people bashing great movies. I have never thought I would ever take the effort to write such a review myself. Burier made me change my mind. This movie is the worst I have ever seen in the Theater. Buried is a 1 on 1 rip-off of Uma Thurman in Kill Bill buried alive and a CSI episode. The acting, the phonecalls, the scenario, cutting his finger, the stupid snake, his dead... Make sure that when you steal a concept, you make it better... not worse. I'm overwhelmed by some of the positive reviews I've seen on IMDb, unbelievable. Wish I could rate a zero. No wonder Scarlet Johanson ditched Andrew...

It was bound to split an audience, such is it's severity of concept. However, most bad reviews seem dumb themselves. Some complain there are no flashbacks - to make it more like a normal movie - some want the character to be more likable - to make it more like a normal movie - some want him to dig himself out (of a potential ton of suffocating sand) with a penknife and they say that the character is dumb for not doing so - like he would have done in a normal movie - some say it's got too much use of the phone in it - huh? Like anyone would not use it as a constant lifeline. Point is - those that wanted a 'proper' movie are the same one's that keep Hollywood dumb and predictable. You get what you deserve, and Hollywood has never been more shite. This was a refreshing and actually very convincing drama that never sold out to the increasingly mind- numbing of formula once.

I was so excited when i saw the trailer, but so disappointed. There was other useful things i could've done with my hour and a half instead of watching this pointless film. The only reason i kept watching is to see if the guy would eventually get out, and guess what...he doesn't! The movie was supposed to be a thriller.

He seems surprised when he gets kidnapped (well wakes up in a coffin). In his coffin are an Iraq mobile phone, a torch, some glow sticks, his zippo lighter his whisky in a small hip flask, a knife and his pills for stress (they don't really work in this situation though)He speaks to a bunch of American people that don't know what to do, and to be fair what was he expecting. Calling 00911 and speaking to the police in America to tell them your buried somewhere in Iraq but you have no idea where is not gonna get you the help you want....Anyway he eventually ends up speaking to some Special Hostage situation team guy over in Iraq that says he can help him. A kidnapper also calls and demand five million dollars (LOL) then later only 1 million Dollars. The Kidnapper is dumb as he should keep the man alive to use as a bargaining tool if he expects any money, but instead is quite happy to let the dude die. Part way through a snake appears in the coffin and then escapes through a small hole in the side after he tries to burn it with his whisky. If a snake can get in and out then I'd be digging through that side of the coffin with the knife to try and follow it out, he cant be that deep as he gets 3 bars on his phone! Anyway, he dies when he to much sand falls in from a hole in the top of the coffin.As far as horror goes, it is horrific, the poor man's living in a real nightmare where he is helpless from start to finish. There are scenes that are genuinely harrowing to watch, like the shear frustration and impotence of the dude, and the call with his wife.I gave it 5 stars as it did invoke some true horror, did make you sit there and wonder if he would be saved or not and it was original, (well not that original, i read a similar short horror story a few years back, with a man in a coffin with a mobile phone and helpless, the police don't really believe him and cant help and it turn out he was buried alive on top of the coffin of his living-dead wife, who is clawing up to get some revenge)I could not give it a higher score as it was virtually a snuff film & the ending was just nasty and left you feeling sad at the end. They should have saved him, even if they just showed a slither of daylight through one of the cracks across his face and then ended the film there instead of watching him get crushed to death.If you wanna feel sad and peed off then deffo watch this film.",Buried
358,MongoOnion,"Quite bad, in all honesty.",4,20 April 2012,"It's a shame, really. The acting in this film is outstanding, and the concept very original.Unfortunately these positives are overshadowed by the incredible stupidity and clichés this film is just teeming with. We get to watch Paul sit inside a magical box where the laws of gravity do not matter. Lighters apparently give off oxygen, when in the box. Sand can fall for a good time and will only pile up when it feels like it. Snakes and other assorted goods will teleport in and out at will.Then there's Paul, who decides to waste his phone battery calling up his Alzheimered mother (oh and did I mention, his father is dead. What a cliché...). He has in-depth conversations with several individuals over the phone, giving us all the necessary backstory. I'm surprised nobody ever asked what material the coffin was made out of, at the rate they were going. Then there's the big bad terrorist who can apparently track down Paul's family (Paul becomes convinced that maiming himself will solve this issue). Or better yet: how about that snake Paul thinks a good way to deal with is to spray it with alcohol and set it on fire? Fun fact: the alternate title of this film was 'Man Who Talks On Cellphone: The Movie'. Numerous times this film tries to become deep, pardon the pun, and it just falls flat on it's face time and time again. The only way to enjoy this mess is to take it as an unintentional comedy.

Nowadays there's all these movies out there that promise ""You'll be on the edge of your seat till the very end!"" and most of the time we found ourselves watching the clock and wondering if a fresh thing of popcorn is waiting outside this dungeon of mediocre theatrics. However, it seems that ""Buried"" delivers the goods and a lot of them. You will have so much fun watching this film. Setting aside my male bravado honestly i found myself becoming more and more sensitive to claustrophobia as the film progressed. Another thing is that WAY to many people on this site that are reviewing this film are complaining on how ""Oh that could never happen"" or ""Oh a lighter would so do this"". Why don't you just chill out and realize that its a F%@king movie! If you want the true to physics experience of being buried alive.......... Bury yourself!

I kept watching this movie because I wanted to know if he would get out of the coffin. I kept thinking about Uma Thurman trapped in the coffin on Kill Bill and thought if she can get out of a coffin then for sure Ryan (Paul) can as well. Also I was a little bit surprised that Paul didn't try to get out of the coffin when the sand was coming in. Although maybe it was because he wouldn't get out fast enough, it was too dangerous outside, or he didn't know how far under ground he was buried. Also I have one thing that i was also thinking about, doesn't the army have heat motors for this reason, so they can find people buried, and if they don't why not? I'm sure it would be a smart investment for them, and it does seem like something like this movie would happen in Iraq.

363,sh_habibi,Simply Brilliant !,9,14 February 2011,"Let's be honest : A movie with just one Actor ( not mentioning the voices ) , which also takes place in a coffin , should be a masterpiece to make you watch it without getting bored for even one second ! This movie is not less than a miracle ! Not even a single shot includes the world "" Outside "" and that means you are in the coffin with the character for about 90 minutes and you can feel him ! His moves , his anger ,and mostly his desperate need of help ! It is not a simple task to bring such a suspense in a movie like this and you may think : OK ! so he is buried ! I don't know anything about him , so why the hell should I care ?! But that's the point ! Even though there are no flash backs in the movie , you get to know the character and you start to feel worried about him and his destiny ; and that's because of the extraordinary work of the director / writer / actor triangle ! This is a movie worth watching every second . My personal opinion , is it should have been at least nominated for few Oscars ( Boldly : Screenplay ) . Anyhow , watch it and enjoy every painful second which will not let you go so easy !",Buried

If he had managed to use his knife to say knock a few boards off and maybe dig his way out of the 2 - 3 feet of sand that was on top of him this would have been a decent movie. Instead he had all this stuff in his box that he didn't find until half way through the movie and he used a lighter to get light when he was laying on snap lights.

He has the knife from the bag that he doesn't find before the KIDNAPPER informs him its there although it has LOTS of thing in it! And whats up with that ridiculous call from his employers?!? Even people who doesn't know ANYTHING about lawsuits and insurance can hear that he should hang up that call after just the first few sentences but he just lies there and answers! Seriously after that I almost wish he just dies! Thats how obnoxious he is! Thats how illogical he is... He keeps doing so many stupid things in that coffin that you just can't believe it!!! And yes its not even original - People have been buried alive in movies so many times - and yes the CSI episode probably is fresh in memory but at least Nick Parker doesn't behave like an obnoxious little brat for 90 minutes so I'd rather watch that episode ten times than having to ever re watch this horrible, horrible movie!!!!",Buried

It's getting flack from a few people for being 'boring', 'predictable' and having a dislikable protagonist. I have to say that while you cannot fundamentally argue against someone's opinion on something subjective like a movie, these people must be off their nut.Reynolds' performance is outstanding, and I've never seen him in a film of his that I've liked before. His acting is very believable, you experience each emotion as he does, something which cannot be said of 99% of actors in the industry. He carries the film like a pro, credit where credit is due, it can only take a pro to make a film without any explosions, excessive gore, guns, car- chases, etc. more watchable than anything else that's been made recently. It's a treat for the eyes, beautiful to look at.Suspense is key- something most thrillers either don't understand or can't achieve. The director and writer have made something excellent out of very little. Basically it's not high brow, it's not low brow, it's not action-packed, it's not boring, it's not star-studded, it's got an outstanding lead performance- amazing.",Buried

It was all completely unbelievable apart from one thing - the claustrophobia feeling that overcomes you. It is difficult to not watch this film and feel dread at thought of being buried alive - straight away the film makers have your attention, griping you in a choking vice grip of a ride but unfortunately, the ride lasts about 10 Min's and the grip quickly loosens.Ultimately the 'twist' at the end was predictable and boring, in fact it was not a twist more waiting for the painful inevitability.

378,omarketta,Antiwar Propaganda Disguised As A Movie,1,24 January 2011,"I've read a lot of reviews criticizing plot items in the film and using those to support their poor rating and disgust with this film. I agree it was a poorly written film, several items back that up including; the oxygen would run out after the fire for the snake, his Zippo burning, and the 2 hours spent breathing in the box. He could have just dug his way out, and why was he so rough with everyone on the phone, hanging up on several people trying to help. Not a good way to get 'rescued'.So it was a bad and boring film, but I contend that this is because it's not really a film. Instead it's an anti-war propaganda summary disguised as a movie script. Movies are supposed to be entertaining so whether I agree with the Iraq war or not I want each of the plot twists and characterizations in the movie to be in support of providing me, the viewer, with entertainment.But in this movie the characters and plot twists are all in support of an anti-war argument. Here's why I think that's the case and how the script backs up an agenda instead of entertainment. 1) Corporations are evil and greedy especially companies involved in the Iraq are bad. They send this poor truck driver out without security and armored trucks to be slaughtered. Then once they find out he's about to die in a box they call him to let him know that he is not going to receive a penny from them and his family is screwed because the company is evil and greedy. Do we really need this 'recorded message' from this terrible corporate executive to support the script? He basically just says sorry but we are bad and you're poor and we already know at this point in the movie that the State Department and FBI are his only chance out, so why take a shot at the company? 2) The FBI and the Government lie to us. The one guy who seems to be genuinely good and trying to help is the agent over the phone. He seems to genuinely care and mentions a guy named 'Mark White' who was a Dr. trying to help the poor people of Iraq recover from our mistake of invasion. He was saved though and is home safe, which we find out in the end is a lie and he's dead in a box. There is no reason to have this in the script other than to say that the FBI lies and this poor guy is dead. The point of this final scene in the movie is to say that his rescuers are at the wrong grave and our trucker is going to die, you don't need to know who the other guy is or what his name is unless we need to have a final image of the lying agent and our lying US government in our minds. 3) The real bad guys aren't the insurgents it's the US Government and our greedy corporations. The insurgent over the phone is the one getting bombed and described to Paul as an individual just like you and I. After all 'what would you do?' the agent asks Paul if this was the only way you could make money. The insurgent/terrorist says I used to have 5 children now I only have one and also says 'I had nothing to do with 9/11'. Couldn't be more obvious that we should feel sorry for him and the Iraqi's and that maybe he's not the 'real bad guy'. All this was added to the plot and script so that we can be hit over the head with the message that the script writer and director want to get across. The US government is bad and the US corporations are greedy and in the end they are the guilty ones, not the poor insurgents with nowhere else to turn or the poor un-educated workers who volunteer to serve only to be screwed by their companies and held up for slaughter. Please for our sakes keep this kind of propaganda in the blogs and out of our theaters. I'm just trying to spend my hour and half watching a good movie, which this definitely wasn't.",Buried

I'm a big fan of drama and thriller films and i found that Buried is sort of good film indeed despite of some delectable errors they've made.why i like this film the most are: 1) the new idea/theme of this film are quite rare 2) it touches about political situation in Iraq related to the US intervention. 3) even though the 'space' was limited, thumbs up to the cameraman as they shoot variety of nice angels. 4)the ending was great!however, there were some goofs in this movie: 1) the acting from Ryan Reynolds was not very perfect(the way he speaks sometime looks like he was not in a desperate situation) but i think he has delivered the best performance ever so far in Buried. 2) there are some mistakes in the film such as when the camera zooms out, the wooden box's walls seem very high. the battery life seems last longer than usual and the signal shouldn't be that clear.but in overall, this film is worth to watch for.",Buried

I understand the reason for the whole film in a box, but I disliked that fact simply because it was too plain. I mean anyone could have filmed something like that. The film was a low budget film which I like the idea of the fact that good productions do not necessarily need a great deal of money, OK.I believe the thing that I find best about the film was how it creates suspense from the beginning of the film. When everything is dark and I actually thought the screen was broken until I heard the narrator begin. But like I said it creates suspense very well up until the very last minute. Audience wandering if he'd life or die.I would say i'd wasted my money, but I wouldn't say there aren't a lot more other films I'd rather watched tonight...",Buried
381,neuroisaac,Laughably bad,3,17 February 2011,"I guess the thing that I did wrong was go into this movie with relatively high expectations. I'm a fan of minimalist films from Hitchcock's ""Rope"" to Schumacher's ""Phone Booth"". Within the first couple minutes of this film, I was hooked and felt set up for an exciting evening. The claustrophobic atmosphere that had been created was almost palpable and the acting seemed okay.Unfortunately, that was as good as things got. As the film progressed and the unbelievably bad voice acting kicked in, the plot just got ridiculous. I couldn't help but think of a group of people sat around a table brainstorming at a meeting saying things like ""You know what's scary? Being buried alive is scary!"" And someone else piping up ""You know what else is scary? Snakes are scary!"". As so many disparate elements attempted to come together, I stopped caring about the fate of the protagonist.Quite disappointed. Though I would normally applaud an endeavour like this one, I have to say that I would try and avoid this monumental failure. Having said that, I did make it to the end of this film, which is why I've chosen to give it 3 stars instead of 1.",Buried

383,cpp0003,Why are the rankings so high??,1,21 January 2011,"I finished watching this movie with my fiancé with a big question mark on my face. The thing is, if the character Ryan Reynolds played had even half of a brain, there wouldn't have been a movie. Any human being in the world that found themselves in that situation wouldn't have ever tried to continue pushing up on the coffin after they realized dirt (not sure how much) was above them. There were cracks all in the sides of the coffin, so I kept asking throughout the movie why doesn't he make use of something and try to pry himself out of the sides and dig up??Another thing that gets me is the language on the Blackberry. The very FIRST thing I thought of was ""Hey, let's try changing that to English!"" He thinks of that an hour later as his time is ticking. Oh, not to mention his bag of supplies at his feet. He doesn't discover the fact that he has not one, but TWO, glowsticks, a flashlight, and a KNIFE of all things. It's like these were the nicest terrorists I'd ever seen. They pretty much wanted to prove how dumb Americans are in this film apparently. Obviously, before they even told him he couldn't be buried too deep because he had a signal, I thought to myself, ""Gee, how does he have a signal under all of that dirt? He can't be too far under."" However, despite this, not ONCE does he try to get out. And then the snake situation...oh my God. Are you really serious right now? He sets it on fire??? He has STEEL TOED BOOTS ON and the snake is, ironically, RIGHT AT HIS FEET. So why he just didn't start kicking it and smash it to death is another thing that doesn't add up in my book. And then there are the phone calls. How the hell did he get 911 in Ohio? Why did he just keep screaming at everyone? Why did he continue to answer the questions from Alan whoever, who from the first question was obviously out to tell him they had no legal right to help him? So was he sleeping with that woman Pamela or not? How come he kept running his battery down? Why would he use a lighter when his phone has a backlight? Why did he continue to keep the phone on vibrate? If the snake could come in and out, why couldn't he? How was he writing upside down with a pen, and why? Why write ""HELP"" on the ceiling of a coffin? And, finally, how in the HELL DID THEY SPEND $3,000,000 on this??The entire movie is a series of constant, ""Why, why, why?"" or ""How the hells?"" I do not in any means think the plot was ""brilliant."" In fact, the plot was fairly stupid. If a terrorist, or in this case not terrorists but commoners who wanted money, wanted to get you to make a video, then why the hell would they go through all of this trouble? I'm pretty sure tying you up and putting a gun to your head forcing you to make the video would be much more effective than giving you an ultimatum while you're buried under the ground. So plot? Brilliant? Think again, brainless reviewers. My three year old niece could've thought of that.One compliment is that Ryan Reynolds does do a wonderful job with what he is given. He's a good actor though, what else can I say? I can say it is really clear to me why I found this movie I had never heard of in the Redbox. I only rented it because of Reynolds, and I was pleased with his acting but not with the character he was given. It is so ultimately crystal clear why this movie was a flop and lost $2,000,000. Regardless of what stupid people think, this movie is NOT a 7.4 out of 10. Movies that are that good don't lose money with movies, they make millions.",Buried

It is very realistic thanks to the great acting of Ryan Reynolds and a great screenplay. Thanks to this movie I'm going to go see any movie the screen play writer makes. This film deserves way more credit then it's gotten and I can't believe it didn't get a nationwide release. Basically the move is about A man stuck in a coffin with only a lighter and a cellphone with a dying battery. He has 90 minutes to get 5 million dollars or he will be left there to die.

387,euanbuddie,Very good,10,5 October 2010,"What a film. It's a fantastic idea for a film as it makes the audience focus on the narrative of the film rather than special effects. The unexpected twist just adds the great end to the film, which is extremely rare in Hollywood films. It had a heart-breaking story line , not recommended for the light hearted, which could also consider the consequences of war. The whole aspect of being buried underground, with limited air, a mobile, a lighter and a mystery to solve, is spectacular. But what really amazed me was the fact that the whole thing was seen through the 'eyes' of Paul. You were trapped along with him and it certainly felt that way. It is a high tension film that constantly keeps you in awe with anticipation and leaves you wanting more. The acting is spot on and really shows off the work that Chris and Rodrigo have done. It's a must see film.",Buried
388,frankel2005,A unique and intense experience - see it,8,26 September 2010,"No need to regurgitate the plot - just look at the title and it's laid right out for you on a platter. Yes, the majority of the movie does take place inside a stale wooden coffin. Yes, it's mostly a 'one-man-show' with Ryan Reynolds struggling to free himself of the malicious situation that he is in. But, what one might not expect is that Buried is quite moving and the feeling I had leaving the theater was rather an enjoyable one. I left knowing I got everything I wanted when I purchased my ticket - something that's not so common with genre movies in this day and age. There's more to the movie than just him in sheer panic. Reynolds calls various numbers for help that may or may not lead anywhere. He slowly discovers that the villains left more for him in the coffin than he originally thought. And his Blackberry phone comes in handy for multiple uses other than making phone calls. And director Rodrigo Cortes cleverly blinds you from worrying what might happen when you have a flask of whiskey and a lighter six feet underground. I know a lot of people won't be able to handle watching it. It's very unnerving and super claustrophobic. But I enjoyed it. And get this - the coffin isn't completely airtight - leaving nice room for some snakes to get in and bite him a'la Indiana Jones. See it.",Buried

However, if you get sleepy in movies this one is perfect because it may have worked as a radio program a lot better as you do not need to see anything to follow the story line of calling out on a cell phone from the inside of a coffin.

Him in the box succumbing to fear. Who wouldn't. You're buried alive. He does what any person would do, freak out. He also does what most people know not to do. Make deals with terrorists. They never keep their end of the deal, so why would you even consider it? Its a frustrating film that only makes you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself to save the time and money and clean the gutters or re-organize your bills instead. At least you would know that the agony would pay off in the end. I don't want to spoil the film for anyone,.. oh wait. I already did. Its about a guy in a box, freaking out, making deals with terrorists. At least it ended realistically. Fortunately, after dragging myself through this ""movie"", I was actually able to finish watching ""Hobgoblins"" (1988).My Advice, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Some call the movie ""cerebral"" (bull), or ""thrilling"" (for like 1 whole minute at exactly the middle of the movie), or even ""suspenseful"" (which I must agree as you are thoroughly in suspense for the movie to finally end), but I call it ""a big waste of time"", ""agonizingly boring"", and ""mind-shatteringly ridiculous""!

391,gnrconspiracy,90mins of pure frustration!,3,10 October 2010,"Like most films these days, this is another over-hyped disappointment. I walked into the Cinema hopeful of an awesome, edge-of-your-seat thriller, I walked out feeling ripped off. There are spoilers in this review, so I have warned you. Anyway, the premise is this; a truck driver (Ryan Reynolds) contracted in Iraq gets buried in a box somewhere in the desert with only a mobile phone, a pocket knife, a zippo lighter and a torch. It transpires that he has been buried and held hostage for ransom. Rapidly running out of air and sanity, he has to get a large sum in American dollars paid to his captor or else he will be left to die. Sounds good doesn't it? The bottom line is, the movie is filmed entirely within the box, it involves the captive (Reynolds) desperately trying to get himself rescued, and ends with him not getting rescued and *spoiler alert* dying. I thought, what a waste of 90mins. If he'd have been rescued, at least it would have given the film some purpose. I think the film should have had some scenes from outside the box to add interest to the viewer. I really don't see how this movie got so much hype and such a high score on here.",Buried

But I knew the film was a loser when he calls back nicely but ends his call with a $/&@ you to her. NO ONE WOULD EVER DO THAT IN THIS SITUATION. If for no other reason than that it burns a bridge with perhaps the only live person you'll get a chance to talk to. The way overly cynical message about contract firms in Iraq via a TAPED phone call (which of course would be legally inadmissible because he was not in his right mind) was laughable, and to have him on the call answering questions about legalities when oxygen and battery life were what should have been on his mind is also ridiculous.Overall just a wreck.

393,liluzizu,Buried alive or born dead?,1,28 January 2011,"This obnoxious movie has made me produce my first IMDb review ever. Realized as the director's sadomasochistic fantasy on the screen, the movie left me almost physically disturbed and nauseated. Extremely visceral tortures of the main and only character shamelessly exploit everyone's fear of being buried alive - with no apparent moral or artistic reason. If this movie is about being buried alive, then any value it could have has always been born dead.After spending these awful ninety minutes in the coffin with the stupid Paul, I was trying to understand why the director put me there. And I see no other reasons than the most stupid ones such as these: Showing that the more you like national symbols (the terrorist mentions the American flag decorating Paul's house in Michigan, and there a tattoo reminiscent of American flag on Paul's wrist) the less government cares about you.Showing that all mothers-in-law are inane witches who like to have fun and not to care if their sons-in-law call in trembling voice (from Iraq, by the way) and not even bother to tell about this their daughters.Showing that, while all the other technology fails on you, your cigarette lighter is an everlasting product with amazing qualities. (it is good though that, together with dying Paul has also quit smoking)Showing that all lawyers are deeply inhuman beings.Showing the exciting underground life of snakes whose little hobby is to get into and out of every man pants.Showing what happens to the person who is cheating on his wife. The director did not provide us with any other possible reasons of why the universe was so cruel to Paul and not to any other American citizen which was available for kidnapping that day in Iraq.I could not get any other comprehensible messages (""the famous American family values"") from this movie. Paul's voice message to his son is the epitome of very bad taste and very poor acting. It is a boring and stupid reason to make a movie, unless you are a sadist and like to see what happens to a person who is buried alive with the closest approximation.Why the director who cares so much to make you feel like you are in coffin, treats his spectators as the most stupid people? Why Paul is burning his oxygen with his lighter? Because the viewer needs to see something and it is not possible without light. Why the director would not come up with something more inventing? As a result, you cannot be compassionate for someone as stupid as Paul.The movie's aim is to hit you, literally, physically hit you - not to move you aesthetically or ethically but to simply kick you in your face. That's what that dull movie is all about.",Buried
394,hasnul_leo,"Air, time & space ... Imagine if we lack of these altogether ?",6,4 December 2010,"It's quite funny of how 99 % of this film scenes are inside a wooden coffin. Though it still have the ability in portraying the persona by the effort of the director in delivering a suspenseful story of confusion, panic and emergence of a matter of life and deathEspecially on a particular scene where a claustrophobic audience might faint to watch Reynolds struggling to find ways of handling the black snake in his jeans !Focusing on the attempt of a contractor to escape himself from a buried coffin, Paul Conroy still consider to be lucky because he's not fully buried with the dirt. The little space of a regular size coffin, even though it is small but the American still afford to breathe and think fast. He has to act immediately based on the circumstances of his gradually decrease cell phone battery life while the lack of oxygen worsen the situation and the kidnapper who threatens his life in jeopardy leaves him no other options but to use whatever sources it takes to free himself.Reynolds acting certainly convincing along with realistic dialogs given and the immense plot makes us guessing what's next after this ? From issues of entrapment after regaining conscience, problems in bending posture,intense mobile phone conversation with the crisis negotiator and to stream hostage video via Youtube, the story gets tougher and complicated. Middle East aftermath seems the focal point of this movie in terms of how we should always see perspectives on the other way round and this might remind us to stop being judgmental without seeing the big pictureApparently the director, Rodrigo Cortes, presents Buried in a well coordinated yet dramatic impact story though it has also got a lot to do with Ryan Reynolds performance as a desperate character. The inspiring acting successfully touch our empathic hearts as to imagine the horrible escapism experience. In a nutshell, this psychology thriller genre flick is a one of a kind.

The only reason I watched the entire movie was thinking some clever story would come out of it. He would have easily been dead within 3-4 hours from carbon dioxide poisoning. In this guys case, he would have probably died in 1-2 hours from all the yelling and heavy breathing, along with the lighter constantly on. Even after the fire started hours later after being in the coffin spilling chemicals etc. It just makes no sense. Adger Allen Poe would have liked this movie, but I sure as hell would not. I can not believe this high ratings from some users. Notice the people that dislike it give it one star, where as people who liked it say its outstanding? Really? Some user says it is this? How in the world does a person who loves cinema like this movie? I was bored watching it, the most interesting thing was the detective saying he found him but it turned out to be the guy previously mentioned. I do not think a phone would work. Why in the hell did he continue to answer the questions from the co-worker. Even a child would know what he was doing. Why not just hang up? This is got to be the top film to make the most profit.

So it's only right that I donate 15 minutes of my time to help other innocent victims who may be thinking about renting this.I'm only providing a review here to help prevent some other poor sucker like me from seeing the ridiculous 7.4 (IMDb) rating and throwing away 90 minutes of their life. And of course, to help drop the rating closer to where it belongs.This was one of those that are so bad that you're rooting against the main character for most of the movie. It took only five minutes for me to turn on whats-his-face. The character is an idiot and gives no reason for an audience to think the world would be a better place,,, or that ANYONE would be happier,,, if he lived. During the span of this uh ""film"" (lol), I sort of developed a CIA mindset -- that if he dies, his suffering will be ""for the greater good"". His wife will find someone better and his kid will end up with a better dad, and everyone will live happily ever after.If Im thinking about a movie long after I view it, it was worth watching. The only thought I have after watching this movie is what kind of low budget idea can I come up with to scam people out of their money? How about a guy drifting off into deep space in a disabled space capsule? Although something like that might end up being worthwhile to watch, even if by accident.Typically, IMDb is a decent tool to pick movies, but a 7.4 rating (as of Jan 2011) will make me think twice next time. One thing I noticed right away in the comments, is that the viewer either loves it or hates it. If a reviewer likes CSI and all the other mainstream TV, then this is probably a ""10"". If a reviewer appreciates anything with substance, then this movie is a ""1"".But me being one to find positives, there were two positives that this movie gave the world.If nothing else, ""buried"" should be great, easy-to-produce fodder for some hilarious youtube spoofs.

It's so easy to be either dead set against bargaining with terrorists because of the obvious repercussions that brings and it's also very easy to be disgusted when governments or any organised body don't do what they can to save a life.This film brings that dichotomy in to stark contrast and all set in one box underneath the sand.

408,chrislove2010,Really good and gave me goose bumps,9,15 June 2013,"To be honest I flicked onto this channel just for something to watch that was a bit different appose to all the annoying shows out there- The start was abit slow but when he was buried you could see the emotions were shown by the actor very clearly. If someone told me prior to the movie it would be filmed in a coffin all the time I would not have watched it but I'm glad I did now. The ending where he just had hope and lost with the last phone call was indescribable, it.. it gave me goosebumps- and that's very rare to do with these certain films so this is my new best film. I also like the hidden messages as in all of his country didn't want to know and would rather put him on hold and fire him rather than helping him - would that happen to us?. Also how the British man was very good because although you didn't see him face to face you put and the character put all of his trust into him. I love this film. The only bad part was I found the terrorist really annoying! - yes it was part of the reason he was buried but sometimes it was pointless and I couldn't even understand what he was saying.",Buried
409,swoopdast,Call that an ending?!,4,25 April 2013,"Okay, I gave this movie a 4 out of 10 simply because, up until a certain point, I was quite enjoying it. I was really emotionally involved with the character, I was right there alongside him when he talked to his kidnapper, made the ransom video, fought off the snake, I felt his desperation, was consumed by his fear, and I was certain that this emotional roller coaster was going to have a very powerful ending that would set cinematic history.I was let down, people! As there is only one character on screen for the entire duration of the film, can it really come as a surprise that the audience becomes attached? No! It can't! So in the final seconds of the film, when the coffin is filling with sand and Paul (Ryan Reynolds) can hear Dan Brenner (Robert Paterson) shouting over the phone that they're racing through Iraq to save him, that they know where he is and they're coming to get him, of course we, the audience, is seriously excited! The coffin is seconds from becoming full and smothering Paul, when he gets a phone call from his wife. The ensuing conversation is very emotional and combined with the life threatening situation he is in with only seconds to live if no one digs him out, it's all very overwhelming, but I was still so excited. But then, as we hear Brenner on the phone announce that they have dug up the coffin, there is a moment of confusion, as Paul is still in the ground, with sand slowly filling his tiny coffin. Then we realize, as does Brenner and Paul... They were taken to the wrong coffin. And Paul is, essentially, screwed. The screen goes black and we know our beloved Paul is dead.This is a terrible way to end such an emotional film. I was going to rate Buried a lot higher until the pointless death of the main character. I mean, okay, maybe they were trying to say that a lot of people die in Iraq and all the deaths are pointless, I get that. But come on, Hollywood, was this really supposed to be a movie with a political message? You might as well have just flashed a neon font at the end saying, ""Bring home our soldiers!"" But that was not what this movie was supposed to be. How can Paul go through so much trauma, so much pain and terror, including watching his friend get shot and then have to cut off his own finger, just to suffocate underground? It made the entire film just seem like a waste of my time, despite how much I enjoyed it up until that point. If you liked it, fine, that's your call and I respect it. But I feel like killing off the ONLY character is simply the equivalent of kicking the audience repeatedly in the teeth. Heartbreaking, but not in the cinematic history kind of way, like the end of Braveheart or Armageddon or countless other films where the hero died. This was simply pointless and ruined the entire movie experience.",Buried

It doesn't worth watching the movie. A guy in the coffin with blackberry phone and no one can found him. It's movie for the most simple audience. The whole plot takes play in one coffin which appears that the main character is buried alive. 90 mins you're watching one guy with a mobile phone, who can use gps through the phone, use google maps and he is tracable and etc. but no one can find him.

Someone else chooses what film we watch and my life gets wasted.,2,9 October 2010,"If you are reading these reviews to help make your mind up about whether to watch the film then I can only advise you not to. It is bloody awful and I left after about an hour. I have read the positive reviews on IMDb that wax lyrical about character introspectives and harsh realities of life and the human spirit.People can imagine they were being entertained if they want but there is only so much of one man scrabbling around in a box I can watch. I can only imagine that those who enjoy this movie have themselves an awesome imagination and were conjuring up visions of the bad guys, the evil plotters, the victim's family etc and having their own personal imaginary movie. I just watched a box and a sweaty guy losing his temper. I was listening to the phone calls but they really were not that interesting either. This was a laughable film until the laughs ran out and snoring began to fill the theatre at which point people laughed at the snorers.I am not afraid to say ""I didn't get it"". Unfortunately many people these days are too willing to jump on the bandwagons quite successfully crafted by big advertising budgets and handsomely paid film critics. The poster for this film and the ""AMAZING"" reviews on it must have been made by kind relatives of the director. If there is something amazing in this film I have missed then I would much rather look like an idiot for not getting it than a complete idiot for pretending I did.This is not some new masterpiece take on cinematography it is just crap. I love small character driven films but this wasn't one.

Considering the lack of change of scenery, I was amazed by my lack of boredom throughout. . And for someone who most of the time wishes that Ryan Reynolds didn't come from his country, I was very, very happy with the performance. Some of it felt a little contrived in a bad Hollywood sort of way, though. The snake incident comes to mind as being a bit dumb, as was the sand- falling-into-coffin thing. And was it just me, or did the coffin slowly get roomier as the movie went on? Also, the soundtrack was really boring and cliché sounding. I would've liked some originality there. It sort of seemed trapped in this weird world of not knowing if it was a Hollywood movie or a low budget indie, but I still dug it.",Buried

And if you are personally fortunate enough to have family it makes you think about how incredibly lucky you really are. All the trivial annoyances of life and relationships fades away.

419,lostatredrock,Suffers from over doing itself,4,18 March 2011,"I would say that this movie had a lot of potential going in but it failed to really capitalize on that potential by pushing way too far in certain aspects. The setting is interesting shooting the whole movie from one point of view, with just a single visible actor the whole time a very confined space no sets to speak of. The set-up is also interesting the whole movie opens to black and you are introduced to the ""world"" of the film along with the main character, you know what he knows when he knows it for sure a lot of potential in that and something relatively unique.So with a great set-up and good idea, what went wrong? Honestly I think somewhere along the chain of making the film they had too much doubt about whether the idea was truly good one or not and so they decided to hedge their bets. They introduce a snake attack and ridiculously stupid fight by fire with the snake, an event which quickly passes and seems to have no lasting effect on anything. It felt like something added in after the fact to ""spice up"" the movie and for that it failed.Same deal with the personal director and his mid hostage crisis exit interview. We had already established through the frustration in getting through to people and the frustration with the hostage negotiator the theme of him being a nobody that his government is OK with writing off. I don't have a problem with the theme being included it was a nice subtle critique which really fit given the setting, but then you throw in the evil corporation meme just to whack us over the head with the uncaring authority idea. It was too much, and again I think the issue is a lack of faith in the idea of the film. Why just add a theme when you can beat us over the head with it and the most ridiculous way possible?Those are the two big examples that come to my mind, and it may seem like just two points in a film which could have been good, the problem is that those issues infect the entirety of the film. The ending for example which without the films other issues may have come across as hauntingly bleak (in a good way) instead came across as the last knock to the head from a film that just didn't get that sometimes less is more.",Buried
420,chrisjames88,Spoilers - Angry at this movie and its message,6,2 February 2011,"I speak of huge spoilers, do not read this unless you have already seem the movie ""Buried"".First of all, I love movies and watch as many as I can. I was also a contractor in the Middle East and a fan of Ryan Reynolds. So, I was very interested in this film on many levels. I enjoyed Ryan's hard work, appreciated the movie for its admittedly narrow scope but I have one huge complaint that lead to a ""6"" score from me (not a 5 because Ryan did a good acting job here). The film made such a big deal out of wanting us to sympathize with the character and realize that he was very scared and did not want to die... he wasn't trying to be macho. As the movie progressed, it began to sink in that this whole movie was MAJOR propaganda! What they basically wanted you to leave the theater with was that he shouldn't have been in Iraq either as a soldier or a contractor and he deserved to die. I was really ticked at the way the material was handled. Do I, a 38-year-old former Marine, expect happy endings for all of my movies... no! I love realistic movies. But I hate propaganda being disguised as film.I'm also a little ticked at Ryan for reading this whole script and not seeing it for what it was. I know he needs to work, but this was some heavy-handed political writing! I expected more from both Ryan and the movie.",Buried

He has a phone and he rings 911 and tells the emergency operator in the USA help I'm stuck in a coffin in the desert in Iraq, unsurprisingly she thinks that maybe this is a crank call. So he rings more people up, and rather than talk he screams obscenities at just about everyone who is unfortunate enough to answer the phone to him. The lucky ones are out and are spared his ranting. If you want to be depressed, to see a hopeless situation manifest itself into the only obvious ending, Its everyone's worst nightmare, being in a box and buried alive, why make a film of it, and nothing else.

Not only is Paul's situation almost completely infeasible, the reception of the cellphone, the snake/fire, his ability to continue to breathe (and/or not get crushed) made a mockery of actual victims/families of hostage scenarios. The ending was genuinely embarrassing to watch (both the finger cutting and the getting 'lost'), and does not float whatsoever. Not to mention the fact that he had his boss call him to exclude liability. I understand that the director really attempted to frame Paul's isolation/vulnerability, but it just came out cheap and unrealistic.

The movie never leaves the coffin, yet the suspense is worth more than films that generally take you to the edge of your seat, because of action sequences. Ryan Reynolds give a great performance, making you care for and understand the character very well. The screenplay posed some really obvious flaws, but you could get past them easily. Overall this film offered a nice change of tempo than what's been expected by Lionsgate (i.e Saw VII).***SPOILERS***I titled this review, because halfway through this movie Paul explains that he has a son, wife, and an ill mother so I allowed myself to relate to the character (as most good films do). I desperately wanted him to survive the incredible odds stacked against him. But this film was more than a survival film that's heartwarming and cheery. It was a realistic tragedy, with a realistic outcome (Paul dies). I felt empty after the movie faded to black as if I lost someone close to me.

Ryan Reynolds handles the screen by himself extremely well and all of his emotions are felt by the viewer. It was somewhat reminiscent of the way Will Smith handled his lone time on the screen in I Am Legend. Aside from the Reynolds, the emotional roller coaster that this movie takes you on is one you won't soon forget. You actually find yourself feeling as if you were in the situation that Reynolds is in. Of course, the plot of the movie also lends itself to plenty of hypothetical situations that you can ""play along"" with, telling friends what you would do in certain situations. However, for me, what makes this movie so good is the final 10 minutes or so. I can honestly say I have never seen an ending to a movie so tense.

I for one did watch it alone in a dark room and never got up once. It would've been nearly impossible. The film is gripping and really connects you to what Ryan Reynolds is experiencing. Many people are comparing this movie to 127 Hours and rightfully so. I watched 127 Hours just a few short weeks before I watched Buried. 127 Hours may be a true story but the film is shot in a manner that I imagine a stoner would find very appealing. A lot of the hallucinations are just too intense to see as anything other than over the top and somewhat comical beyond reason, but the film is still enjoyable and worth all of the positive press it has garnered. Buried on the other hand is extremely realistic. So much so that I began experiencing some symptoms of claustrophobia myself less than halfway through. It is thrilling, terrifying, entertaining, and an overall masterpiece. Put 127 Hours alongside Buried and in my unbiased opinion (as i did enjoy both and have defended 127 Hours on multiple occasions) Buried takes the top spot, no exceptions.

Luckily this movie totally paid off and I wasn't bored for a single second. This is a movie that was probably really challenging to make seeing as they were working within such confines. They did a great job upping the intensity gradually throughout the film without making it to unrealistic or just plain lame. I would've given this a 10 out of 10, but somewhere near the last half hour of the film they decided to try and make a statement about politicians and corporations that just made me groan. It didn't really add anything to the film and just felt shoehorned in to make the film seem more legitimate or intelligent. Would've been much better had they cut those parts.

Initially I was concerned at first as to how a film could remain interesting when its complete focus was on one character trapped inside of a box, but with multiple twists and turns throughout, I was amazed at how engaged I was in the film and found myself quite literally sitting on the edge of my seat.The movie centers on Paul, a driver who has been hired to distribute supplies and such to different areas of Iraq. The film begins with Paul waking up to find himself trapped inside of a coffin. While it is quite believable that finding yourself buried alive would cause any person to begin hyperventilating, it does get annoying rather quickly because Paul's heavy breathing and a black screen is all the audience gets to experience for the first five minutes of the film. Once the movie kicks into gear it's quite amazing how quickly you feel your heart pounding. No truer words were ever uttered as director Rodrigo Cortes introduced the film by stating ""take a deep breath because it will be the last one you take before the film ends.""",Buried

Should probably not have seen this movie if i watched the cast and noticed they where all voices except one. It all and i mean ALL takes place inside the coffin. 50% where just a black screen. Rest was just phone calls and a snake. Ryan Reynolds is the only reason i watch this and the only reason i watched it to the end. Was hoping for somewhat of a good ending but that never came. The end was just *lack of words* bad!! Anyway i'm pretty mad at the moment for watching this. Making 10lines to be able to submit this review seems impossible since it only takes 1 word. BAD!

I personally can not see why you would even make something like this. Probably one of the worst movies of the decade, not showing anything of interest and a character who takes only bad and illogical actions, when he could have actually tried to save himself. If anyone can see what the director wanted to show with this movie, please let me know! Not many movies of this kind and after seeing this one i will never, ever, never want to see another one. A great waste of time, 1h and 30 minutes exactly each time you watch it. At the end of the movie you do not understand anything of the story. you never know who he spoke to, who abducted him, or why.

449,jenniadriana,Emotional Hijack of Epic Film-making History!,9,8 March 2011,"Too many of these reviews tell you the basic plot of the film- yes Paul Conroy's a contractor, yes he has a lighter and a cell phone. OK. Good, we got that. Sheesh! What most people aren't touching on is, literally, the EMOTIONAL HIJACK this film takes every audience member on from start to finish, and leaves them REELING in long AFTER as well! So much terror, so much suspense. I was SOOO overwhelmed that, I literally had to stop watching 4 minutes into the film and come back to it... mainly because being buried alive is my all-time absolute worst fear and running the emotions and thoughts through my head that would be doing so were I there instead of Paul... it's inexplicably beyond the words I have to describe the kind of terror I would be in, and WAS in, simply as the audience member. Cortez, the screenwriters, and ESPECIALLY Reynolds cannot be bested by even the infamous Tom Hanks and Bob Zemekis were they to team up to try to outdo their 2000 ""One-man"" show ""Cast Away"", nominated for several Academy Awards for the very rules it broke in film making history! We all remember what we thought about what it would be like to be that detached for so long, whether we would go mad and give up or stick with it like Hanks's character did. Now, imagine waking up... having no recollection of what happened to you, or where you are now, all you can see is the darkness, and all you can feel is the walls and ceiling closing in on you, and you aren't even aware that you're in a coffin yet! Then, try and imagine the frantic anxiety that comes with finding you actually HAVE a mode of salvation but, due to the inability of other people to understand your plight or listen to you, you hit even more road blocks and the walls become increasingly enclosed, you begin to come to terms with your mortality, and then... No... without listing any of the spoilers in the film, such as the one almost ludicrous ""visitor"" Reynolds has at one point, or the several seemingly idiotic holes that, of course a sound mind and logical thinker would be able to discern... until you step back and put yourself in the character's place, and I want to say literally but I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy, you realize just how little discernment you would have and how lacking your logic would be in such a desperate and confusing situation. And to the guy who said all that about finding your cell tower ID and what not... YOU might figure that out... but 90% of the people in this world would NEVER even think about that... ESPECIALLY in such a desperate situation! So... give it a break. No, PHENOMENALLY well acted, directed, and ESPECIALLY well written! Kudos for making a film with literally ONE face-time character throughout that sickened ME, of all movie-lovers, to the point of losing my biscuits, literally... because I had biscuits and gravy for breakfast that morning!

Can't even do a phone call without questioning everything. Everything! Frustration...Heck they even had to put a snake in the coffin. They really had no other things to come up with than to put a snake in the coffin with the guy. In the beginning of the movie the oxygen was running out as the guy in the coffin had a hard time breathing. Luckily however, oxygen came into the coffin (magic?) because at the end of the movie he can breathe without problems, even tho he spent most of the time in the coffin being rude to people on phone and acting like a complete tard wasting his oxygen on as many things as he could come up with, i.e shouting.Tbh, I would rather spend 1,5 hours buried in a coffin than watching this piece of crap.",Buried

Then, when i read the comments, I kinda changed my mind and because the movie is about 95 minutes, i decided to watch it. And here the miracle starts.......... I couldn't get my eyes off of the screen. There were some things that seemed impossible, like the fact that he could make calls 1 meter under ground or that the FBI couldn't find him via his phone, but who cares about that. The movie was absolutely amazing. I was like with him the whole time, i was struggling with him, crying with him and suffocating with him. And the end.......again it wasn't like all the Hollywood movies with happy ending. I think it was better to en the movie this way rather than Dan finding and saving him which would be too good to be true. And at the end I thought that the movie could end that way, but it's a different thing to expect something, but when that something actually happens, it a different thing. I was cried so much at the end and at the moment when he was recording his will. So cruel, so brutal, but so emotional.I was with him each and every second of the movie, especially the last 30 seconds I was breathing so hard . And after the movie, I literally couldn't move.it made a huge impression on me... This is a must see movie.

452,youngandmature,Moron buried alive,1,23 October 2010,"Amazingly for once the movie critics actually like a film. This movie is well liked by critics and generally has received acclaim from different festivals, including Sundance. Also as per usual is the critics' keen eye for being horribly consistent with their poor choices. They hate and pick on great movies and love the awful ones. Buried has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one of the most unconvincing movies ever made.Firstly, the premise is boring. I, unlike critics, didn't find it claustrophobic or Hitchcock thriller like. For any potential viewers, I warn you now: DON'T WATCH THIS FILM! In all seriousness, the plot is that Ryan Reynolds' character Paul Conroy is a truck driver in Iraq, delivering random goods to a community center when his convoy is attacked. He blacks out and wakes up buried alive in a coffin. He finds a cell phone in Arabic, a knife, a canteen and a Zippo lighter. He gets a call from the person who took him hostage. They are holding him ransom for $5 million dollars. They're not terrorists but simply commoners who have a starving family. The movie revolves around Paul trying to get out of the coffin. He spends a lot of time, calling different law enforcement agencies in America, before getting hold of a hostage negotiator in Iraq, placed there by the US.The entire film sees Ryan Reynolds in a coffin. There are not even any flashbacks, so we see nothing but the dark and the inside of a box.MAIN ISSUES Acting- Let's throw out a general disclaimer of 'I have no beef with Ryan'. I love his other movies. But, he is just not cut out for serious acting. He tries to record his final will and manages to do so horribly, even attempting humor. ""You can have the $700 dollars in my savings account"" makes me want to punch myself out, to put myself out of my misery. The people he manages to reach on the cell phone all have ridiculously fake accents and their daftness makes you wonder of the IQ of the scriptwriter. He tells a woman he's buried alive and she asks for his social security number. His emotional scenes leave us wanting, and the movie is quite offensive to Americans. He repeatedly says that they don't care to save an innocent truck driver and that he'll die like so many other innocents have.Percentages- We spend 1% of the movie with a black screen, indicating darkness. 10% with him scribbling numbers with his pen on the roof of the coffin (you can't write with a pen upside down! Gravity...), 30% with him making pointless phone calls and the remaining 59% of the screen time with him grunting and carrying on, unrealistically. He sounded like a squealing pig when he grunted and groaned, trying to move in the confined space.General Plot- There are a few issues and points raised. A lot of things just don't add up. If he was a few feet from the surface, why didn't he use the knife and break open the crate and make a run for it? He could hold his breath for 30 seconds and doggy-paddle through the sand.Why didn't he give the hostage negotiator his phone number to trace after he managed to change the phone's settings to English? He said the tracing didn't work, but they only tried it by location. Had he given them his phone number, they would have found him.So, did he end up cheating with Pamela or not? How did he not run out of oxygen? How did the phone battery not die? How did his torches and everything else survive? He would always leave them on for no reason when he randomly 'gave up'. Where did the petrol for the snake fire come from? He'd been using the canteen as water earlier to take his anxiety tablets.Who jokes in a ""last moments"" video? Why didn't he send it? How will anyone find the buried video? There are just too many plot inconsistencies, poor acting etc... I can't handle it. I'll hit the sack instead. But, in summary......it's a catastrophic miss.",Buried
453,tenny-gerald,Adrenaline rush,10,19 November 2011,"Its been a tension ride inside the coffin with one character. True adrenaline rush. A Story/truth about the American labors in Iraq.Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) brings the struggle for his life in front of our eyes lively. The frequent calls and transfers for a life struggling guy goes in vain and still he's damn pushing it to the core. On the other end the telephone lines on voice mail increases the tension and edge run phenomenon to the movie. Although some flaws within as the guy burning the lighter for the whole movie when there is limited oxygen, the movie is lifted with the prevailing tension for the life race of a labor.

That is literally all it is a guy in a box. The guy winds everyone up that it is possible for him to such as wasting his phone battery, accepting calls at stupid times most of which are either pointless video requests or being put on hold. He literally calls everyone he knows before calling people worth talking to and does not figure out how to change the language setting until half way through.

456,suniloneverystreet,A decent experimental cinema,7,2 October 2010,"Buried is easily one of the interesting movie experiments I have seen in recent times. Spanish director Rodrigo Cortes takes minimalist cinema-making to new heights by telling a story with just only one character trapped in one location in what is almost dogma 95esque settings, and far more importantly he manages to do so by keeping it interesting throughout the 90 minutes.Buried opens with a man trapped in what appears to be a wooden box buried underground. As the movie progresses we find out he is Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) an American truck driver employed by an American firm - Creston Roland and Thomas (CRT) in Iraq. His last memory is that of his convoy being ambushed by people (as Conroy puts it- terrorists, insurgents who the f**k cares?). As he tries to piece it all together he finds out that he has lost his special contact number ( that apparently every American in Iraq has been given in case of an emergency) but discovers a mobile phone ( in Arabic settings) and a Zippo lighter alongside a pencil, a pocket knife, and supply of anti-anxiety pills ( we later learn that Conroy suffers from anxiety)The rest of the movie is about his frenetic attempts to establish contact with outside world - his family, friends, employers, the state department to seek assistance to 'get him out'. But things start to get complicated when he is contacted on the phone by his abductor who requests him to arrange ransom from the American Embassy. Running out of both phone battery and air to breathe, Conroy soon finds out that the threats are not hollow; he is forced to make a video of himself which finds its way to the you tube. As things deliberate, Conroy starts to realise he is just a small, helpless insect caught in a web spun by devious and meaner players+++I missed Cortes' interview on BBC Radio 4 yesterday so I'm not really sure the actual intention behind the movie but there are enough, unmissable, Geo-political subtexts in the script - ""I never thought I will find myself here"". ""I don't think any of us thought we would find ourselves here"". I read the movie as Conroy being symbolic of America trapped in a situation which he couldn't get out of despite all the technology and the capitalism abound - multinationals ( admit it, doesn't Creston Roland and Thomas sound impressive? especially, if you say it where the outside temperature is 50 degree centigrade?), answering machines ( that great trickster of a machine that promises to callback but doesn't), robot call operators ( Sir, I can connect you to the FBI field office in Boston, New York, Chicago), the protocols (Crisis Steering Committee, Hostage Negotiation Team ) etc, all of which somewhat seem hopelessly trivial in the face of more existential needs.Buried is a intelligent 21st century cinematic marriage of Kafka and Beckett. Philosophically, it is a wonderful screen portrayal of a nervous breakdown in the wake of continuing threat. I found how Cortes had guided Conroy's character through a sequence of emotions - anger, pain, fear, disdain, dread, calm and finally acceptance very beautiful, though in a sense beautiful is not the correct word here. The camera work, especially the use of different angles to emphasise different emotions within the limited setting of the movie is commendable. Last but not the least, I always remembered Ryan Reynolds as that lanky guy wearing a maroon sweatshirt in Two guys , a girl and a pizza place. It is fair to say not anymore. To be frank, he is a bit of surprise here; he lives up to the demands of the role - a lesser effort would have easily made the Buried a 90 minute closeup photo-shoot in dark light settings. Ryan should be proud of his efforts in the Buried.In light of how the idea of cinema is recast lately, movies such as Buried ought to be encouraged, because, amongst million other reasons it defines what cinema is more than how a 3D movie would. I would prefer watching Buried again than writing a review of James Cameron's next big computer generated manipulation that is assured to collectively sweep the humanity into his bank account.",Buried

It was also copied from the CSI plot where the police detectives have dug up the wrong coffin.(Spoiler) Every movie in the Hollywood industry are nothing but a recycle of plots that has been used by many films past or present.

It's certainly not a relaxing film, to say the least (think I must have chewed nearly all my nails down). So if you want a feel good film then don't watch this as it just makes you feel tense, worried, sad, anxious and frustrated.

The entire film being shot in the coffin was a poor attempt to offer atmosphere, the cinema screen being large and not offering any claustrophobic feelings. Also, I heard several people snoring during the 4pm showing.

461,jonoscrib,"In summary, I was sorely disappointed with what I saw",1,11 October 2010,"Overall, I was utterly disappointed with this film. After hype surrounding the release my expectations were running high, but I found myself leaving the cinema feeling cheated and empty.It follows the story of an American truck driving contractor who, prior to the start of the film is ambushed and placed in a wooden coffin and buried underground. The film starts with Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds), waking up inside the coffin. The rest of the film follows Paul as he tries to follow the demands of his captors as well as negotiate his rescue with seemingly incompetent and unconcerned operators in America.The film lacked any real plot line and major events, and seemed to just flow from start to finish in almost a single scene. With an estimated budget of approx. $3 million I expected so much more, especially seeing as it started Ryan Reynolds, but I was let down with poor camera work and a very poor script.A very claustrophobic atmosphere is created inside the coffin, but the film is just over saturated with close up shots a dark lighting. I understand the angle the director was taking whilst creating this atmosphere but it was just too heavy, and I am not surprised that the film only make approx. $100,000 on opening weekend. I feel for anyone (like myself) who entered the cinema with high hopes as you will most likely be solely disappointed and left feeling why a star such as Ryan Reynolds would put his name to such a travesty.",Buried
462,lucybuglass,"A harrowing plot, portrayed perfectly inside a wooden box.",8,13 March 2011,"This film is absolutely brilliant. At first I had my doubts, because of the whole 'it's 95 minutes of a man in a box' argument. It is very difficult to keep an audience entertained in a film with many settings, let alone one. But Chris Sparling and Rodrigo Cortés did it. With a surprisingly fast paced plot and a brilliant performance from Ryan Reynolds, this film is a claustrophobic nightmare. Even the performances from the people on the other end of the phone were brilliant, and created imagery for me. I tried to picture what was going on on the other side of the phone, just like Paul Conroy(Reynolds) would've been doing. This film is a must-see for those who enjoy mystery, as it allows you to use your imagination. We never leave the coffin at all, we are stuck with Paul for every single minute of the film. Awful things happen to the US contractor throughout the entrapment, and just when we think everything's okay, disaster strikes. It is incredibly tense and well written.Some of the scenes are very emotional, and we start to feel sympathetic towards Paul after his rude behaviour towards some of the people he called, who were no help at all. We realise just how serious this situation is, and that it's very difficult for anyone in it to receive help. The film was so plausible, as it is a chilling scenario that could happen in real life. The terrorist (José Luis García Pérez's) voice was chilling, and his voice alone was enough to create the perfect antagonist for the film. We know nothing about him, and we never seen his face. We are just as clueless as Paul. For claustrophobic people like me, this is one hell of a horror film. No gory special effects needed (well, aside from one, which isn't too graphic). Alfred Hitchcock would definitely be proud if he were alive today to witness such a masterpiece, played out in one scene only, much like his iconic ""Lifeboat"".

And there is many more. So many mistakes will turn smart people off.Why he didn't try to use the knife to break out of the coffin is beyond me. He was told he was only a few feet below the sand, even as a last resort he could have attempted it.Its just so obvious its a low budget movie but where did they spend 3 million honestly its mind boggling. Its a miserable film and I kept checking how long more was left. With a few minutes to go I was wondering how they will end it and ya the end was as terrible as the whole thing. It has no point at all. Its so slow all the way through and to be honest if it was any longer I would have packed it in and cut my losses.Stay well clear of this disaster",Buried

Right from the dialogues to the technically impossible script with lack of continuity makes this movie a disaster - especially if you are all set to watch a breakthrough in movie making. Since when 911 is an international number that can use the international dialing prefix? In a place where you have extremely limited oxygen, how long would you keep your Zippo flaming? In the first half, the director wanted to show protagonist's frustration as nobody wants to even hear him out - but, unfortunately his frustration becomes ours. The second half is kinda predictable with a climax that only reasserts that you have wasted your time and mind. Watch this movie if you are a movie-maker or planning to become one - you should know the difference between a good movie and a bad movie.",Buried

Oh, and the ending made me feel like it was an even bigger waste of my time.Whose ""vision"" was this anyways? I watch films for entertainment. This was like putting a cat in a cardboard box and watching the box roll around on the floor for hours. And the cat doesn't even get out, it just falls asleep.Why does he make so many poor choices? Why doesn't he post more videos on the internet? Why does he use his damn Zippo if he can't breathe? Why does he plug up the hole completely where the snake goes out? There's obviously air coming though there. Why doesn't he change the language on the phone in the beginning? Isn't that common sense now? Why doesn't he say in his message that he didn't have an affair? Good Lord, everything about this movie made me want to throw a brick at the screen.",Buried

Needless to say I was very skeptical at first. The movie starts out well enough but as the movie progressed Ryan Reynolds definitely shows what an amazing range he has as an actor. I found myself feeling his frustration, his anguish and his sadness throughout the entire movie. I was even in tears for the better part of the last 30 minutes of the movie, and it wasn't just a little crying this was streaming tears....like the kind of tears that we all saw from millions of preteen girls when Jack dies in Titanic. I loved this movie up until about the last minute. I was SO mad with the ending. I'm not going to say what happened but I went from this is such an amazing movie to I hate this stupid movie all in the matter of a minute.

There were so many scenes that left me saying- ""what the hell is going on?"" or ""why would he do that- that's so stupid"". I felt that it was very hard to watch.

477,rumzt208-947-919415,A Truly Mastered Realistic Horror,10,11 January 2011,"This has got to be one of the most original 'realistic' horror films of all time. Before I go on I should mention that this is my first review of a film so far so please bare with me. The fact that I chose for this film to be my first choice of a review speaks for itself.I was simply astonished at how a full length movie can entail such a simplistic filming method and yet create such suspense, drama and supreme intrigue with only a handful of camera angles and even less special effects.I have been a fan of Ryan Reynolds since his performance in the somewhat down to earth comedy Van Wilder, but honestly I went into the Buried movie not even knowing he was the star. In my personal opinion the man deserves an Oscar for his performance in this role. On a personal note, he has continually displayed an amazing acting talent through the new Amityville Horror film and what is one of my personal favorite films of all time, Smoking Aces.Not only is Ryan Reynold greatly appreciated in this film, but an equal appreciation is handed to the creator Chris Sparling. In Sparlings word regarding the film; ""I think what makes Buried so scary is the fact that it is based on real things, it's not based on a true story but it's based on people really being taken hostage and I think that realism creates that real fear."" And real fear is indeed what is created here, nothing more and nothing less. As Sparling says; ""There very well are people out there who are crazy enough to do that; I'm gonna teach a complete stranger a lesson today"" And that lesson is taught! A lesson to humanity, regarding the intricate details of such a malicious hostage situation. We are also faced with the reality of how our social and political idealism of ones personal life insurance policies, and likewise idealism regarding the war in Iraq (for USA citizens) are challenged.I could barely fall asleep after watching Buried, but in a good way. A must see!",Buried
478,AlterD,Great concept -- horrible writing!,3,14 January 2011,"How am I to feel sympathy for such an idiot of a hero/protagonist/main character, who doesn't even posses basic survival instincts? I understand that, as the audience, we needed light to see the action in the coffin, but c'mon, really, being so liberal with using that zippo lighter??? And even setting a snake (which was the least of his problems) on fire, burning the oxygen that's keeping him alive, just made me want him to die, as less idiots make the world a better place.And how did that snake get in there? Snakes are not like worms; even though they are cold-blooded, they also need plenty of oxygen to survive. If a snake got in and out of there, Reynolds' character couldn't have been buried deep, not even deep enough for sand from above to leak in and fill up the entire coffin.Don't get me wrong, I'm usually not that picky on realism, but this was just too much. Some of those stupid phone calls, trying to add to the drama, didn't work for me either. Because the concept to be buried alive is a pretty scary concept, I think those who gave this movie a high rating, were basically just too consumed or overwhelmed with horror/claustrophobia/adrenaline while viewing the film, so that their minds were not working properly to think critically. Well, at least they were able to enjoy the ride, which I didn't. Good for them. :)",Buried

Overall, i was appalled by the incompetence of the screen writers and they should be shot or 'buried'alive like Ryan Reynolds in this film, so that they do not have the ability to produce such a poor film ever again. do not watch this film it is Shocking. Moreover, I feel that the film in its entirety was lacking in thought, originality and character.

I hope enough like minded people are taking the time to read this before I get blacklisted. Look at the scheme of things a little closer and I hope everyone sees how, the seemingly trivial details about our country and world can be fixed, if we as a people make the right choices. Don't get me wrong it's worth watching. I was just looking at what it cost to make this film. $3,000,000. Three million dollars for a movie which is just a guy, (an actor overpaid?) in a box, the whole time. Makes me think...No wonder this country fell into recession. Stop the war.

481,scaringi3232,Great movie that only lacks a proper ending.,7,15 January 2011,"Just finished watching and I must say that I really did enjoy this movie. The claustrophobic atmosphere in this movie is done very well, which is accompanied by terrific acting from Ryan Reynolds. Were some people have a problem with seeing only one person the entire film I see it as only adding to the films already great atmosphere, it helps achieve what the filmmakers were trying to achieve IMO.So potential viewers watch the movie knowing what it is and enjoy. Don't listen to all the negative comments about this movie as for the most part their idiotic or from people who forgot about the fact that the movie was good because they were let down by the ending. For example I red a review were the reviewer questioned why he didn't escape through the snake whole? The comment alone makes his entire review invalid as it is so preposterous to even think that would be an option. While another reviewer questioned were did he get the gasoline from his flask when he was drinking from it earlier to take his medication, again if a reviewer can be so unintelligent as to not realize that some sort of alcohol was in the flax and thus is also flammable his review should also be thrown out the window.Now to the ending. This is the only part were I can agree with the negative comments. The ending for me was a complete letdown. You should never leave your viewers without some sort of a reward in the end. Basically you sat through 90min of this guy in a coffin trying to find his way out and as a result you start to care for the guy and want him to be rescued however that's not what you get. Instead you've now sat through 90min just to see the guy die, not a good idea. The ironic part is if they just had it end when the character himself accepted his fate that would have been more proper instead while that's happening and we the viewer are accepting his fate as well they suddenly give the the character and viewer a new sense of renewed hope only for the letdown to happen.That being said though, I will not give this film a negative rating or review because I was not pleased with the ending. The movie itself is great IMO and realistically any person put in a similar situation would likely have died also. So as much as I would have wanted a rescue ending the outcome that did occur would have likely been the probable one given this were a real situation for someone.",Buried

In other words: ""Does he make it out alive?"". Once you learn the ending, there is less motivation to watch it again.Other: I'm curious to learn how this movie had a 3 million dollar budget..

490,rvlust-964-544894,Seriously??,3,30 January 2011,"OK, bad product. But I'll offer some free advice on how it could have been better.1.) Make it a comedy. Yes that may sound a bit crazy, but it would still be an improvement. At least I'd be laughing *with* the product and not at it.2.) Add some twisted cruelty. Yep, the story tried to be cruel, but in the end you were thanking the villain for taking this goof out of the gene pool. But how much more fun would this have been had the kidnapper repeatedly let the guy escape, only for poor old Paul to keep waking up buried again? At least there would be interest in the manipulation of his psyche. Is this real? Or am I dead and in hell? You know, kind of how you felt as a spectator trying to watch the full movie. You wouldn't even need the Iraq plot. The villain could simply be some demented small town American farmer. Or some bored teenagers.3.) Free internet release. Chop it down to 15 minutes and use it to sell advertising. If you fast forwarded to the end, would you really have missed anything? Aside from the perception of time dragging by while waiting for this guy to die, I don't know what that could be. Phone call to employer. Phone call to wife. Phone call to kidnapper, rescuer, etc. Oh, wait! and something to creep out the ophidiophobics, eeek! (BTW, has anyone ever heard a snake make squeaky noises like that?). Paul dies. And poof, roll the credits.See? It could have been used as a 15 minute short to sell advertising and this project wouldn't be buried in red ink. I guess this thing lost a ton of money, most of which had to be promotional costs. So without promotional costs, you could at least recoup the production costs. All you'd have to do is find out what type of person would rate this movie any higher than a 5, advertise what they like and sell the crap out of it.

It brings us on a journey, with a man who's fate is sealed. The movie shows different stages of dealing with death from the perspective of a man who knows he's dying.

493,theregoesben,Spoilers - Horrible Movie,1,4 February 2011,"First of all I seriously think critiques have no grounds for rating movies for the rest of us. They don't like the same things the general public likes, and they mostly have reviews full of stuff irrelevant to what anyone cares to hear.To the movie:Ryan Reynolds is a great actor, don't get me wrong. But whoever directed this film did so in a very poor, very cheap way. First of all there is no back story so getting emotionally attached or feeling anything for the ONLY actor in the movie doesn't come in to play. You see a guy in a box at the very start of the film and at the end... he's still in the box. The only time you see anything from outside of the box is a video on a cell phone he happens to have on him (given by the terrorist or w.e.) of 2 faceless guys and a girl who gets shot.The estimated budget for the film was 3mil but if you watch it yourself about 80% of that budget went towards Ryans salary. The production costs such as editing, camera angles, and dialogue used in the film could have easily been done by a film student (first year at that).The only really interesting thing in this entire movie is the fact that the ending is not something you would expect. Other than that, as said in many other reviews, this movie is a guy in a box, with a glowstick, flashlight, cellphone, piece of paper, booze, pills, and empty wallet, and a zippo.I am very disappointed that ryan even agreed to make this movie. If it wasn't for him i wouldn't have even considered wasting my time. I'm even joining this website JUST to leave this review because the film was THAT bad.The main thing that bothers me with this movie is the fact that he wasn't buried that far underground, close enough to the surface to have cell phone reception... if that was the case seeing as how his coffin was a little less than 2 feet tall, even if the dirt or sand poured in he wouldn't have much further to go to get out. People are buried in graveyards at 6 feet deep. I doubt someone would spend a large amount of time digging a hole for someone just to have them die. Also the dan guy says that the town was bombed that ryan was buried in. Then later they pick up a guy on the road who knows where an American is buried alive... as fast as it SOUNDS like the guy driving the car that dan was in was driving there is no way anyone could drive THAT fast through a city that was just bombed.Another thing, the phone he had, sending and receiving videos... unless he had a 3g connection or something fast there is NO way the videos he sent being as long as they were could have sent that fast. Not to mention the several shots of the phone showing the battery life going up and down. if he had that good of service through an Egyptian carrier they could have traced it. I don't know, this whole movie for me just kinda made me mad...the only feeling of accomplishment i got was adding another movie to the wall of shame... I really hope ryan thinks or even reads the script before making anymore movies... he'll be lucky if this doesn't hurt his career. And i hope whoever directed the film learns the importance of a back story, scenery, plot, suspense, LOCATIONS, and the simple principle that you have to spend money to make money... (see avatar)If paranormal activity can have a budget of less than 50k and make as much money as it did with no name actors... someone spending 3 million and having a famous actor should be able to make a better film... that should be implied.Don't waste your time.",Buried

497,raj-author,"Great movie, but......",7,9 February 2011,"Why why why? I don't understand the wisdom of some movie makers sometimes. They make a powerful movie- like this one- and yet botch the end with an anti-climax. Why can't they understand that the movie-goer is DESPERATE to see a happy ending? Is it that difficult for them to realize that the viewer is actually LIVING out this ordeal with the actor, as if he/she-- the moviegoer--is being actually buried alive! And by the way, every emotion the actor – who is buried alive—is going through, is so real feel-able, real and tangible –kudos to the director, actor and the team for some great cinema. So what does the cine-goer want? The desperate relief of getting out of that darn grave in the end! Yet the director/ writer are pitiless! They don't grant the viewer, the relief-- the victory--he/she seeks so desperately. Had there been a positive end and the guy come out alive and victorious after his heroic struggle/effort, us viewers would have joyfully received it as OUR OWN and personal victory. Doesn't the director know the cine-goers are coming to watch a movie to get some relief from their own life. Saddled with everyday concerns and ever surmounting problems of life we moviegoers reach movie theaters to relax, lose ourselves in someone else's life and WIN! And when this doesn't happen, you feel cheated. the much needed relief you wanted—of an escape-- doesn't happen! Had that been the case, I would have surely leaped up on my feet – as credits would be rolling--- and handed out a loud applause to a great movie. This well made movie collected a paltry 1 million in US and I am pretty sure, it would have collected much more than that-- probably 10 million -- had the end been what I have suggested.

I think the only other movie that sucked as much as this one was The Butterfly Effect...another movie which devalues human life. Of course, all the kids are going to come out to write reviews of the movie and call it ""edgy"", ""riveting"", ""brillianty done"" or some such stupid combination of adjectives so that they can be one of the crowd that sound like they're cinematic geniuses. Spend your money & time on something worthwhile which shows life to be a beautiful thing that's not undervalued, and good prevails.",Buried

Through out the movie only bad things happened. it would have been great to see in the end he made it out alive and the company he worked for get their just deserve. What about the wife and kid.

But then ""Devil"" actually turned out to be pretty good. So I watched buried and it started to get more intense and suspenseful toward the end of the movie. (It somewhat seemed to reflect a little bit of the real world quite accurately.) However, I was disappointed in the last seconds of the movie. I like to see a horror, thriller, or action movie or basically anything along the lines of non-childish, that has a happy ending. A lot of the movies that are usually rated R or PG-13 seem to have sad, bummer endings. The movie ""Mist"" for example by Stephen King, now I understand because it is Stephen King so the shocking is fairly expected, but a lot of movies are getting that way. Do most people not enjoy a scary movie to have a happy ending anymore? I really would have been satisfied enough to rate the movie an 8 if there were at least an alternate ending. I will say that I thought the snake scene was really good.",Buried

A long box, the length of a human body, buried deep beneath the ground. From there the film plays out in an awe inspiring way, especially seeing as there's only so much you can reveal from one location. The way Rodrigo Cortes handled the filming is truly exceptional. From the start the camera switches between closely claustrophobic, and flying high above Ryan, showing the box with him inside and black all around. It's constantly on the move just like our main character's thoughts. Diving in when the action is intense, and then cutting to black when you don't think you can take any more.The spacing and plot of the film were nothing short of genius. And Chris Sparling, the writer, should be commended for his work. He said after the showing, that after having his scripts rejected for their cost of locations, he decided to go for a cheep but genius idea. One location, one star, and a wealth of idea's. It makes a film like 'Salt' look like a giant waste of resources, when Buried does what even some of the best thrillers can't do, it brings us inside the character's head, and does it all without a romp through the city, or blowing things up.If you're one of those people who loves to sit on the edge of your seat, chewing at your fingernails, while you're constantly asking yourself what's going to happen next.

The beginning of the movie is simply the writer's attempt to make a joke about the ineffectiveness of 911 and other customer service. Every single thing that Ryan Reynolds does is completely ignorant. After it becomes quite obvious that the people who are'helping him' are only interested in saving themselves from bad press, he still agrees not to call the press...idiot. In the end, he dies and they win...which I end up not caring about because he was so ridiculously stupid about everything.

There were no cut-away shots to show what else was going on. Every so often the screen would go dark and that was really boring to sit through until he lit his zippo lighter or the cell phone would ring. I can't believe Ryan Reynolds took this role because he is a well known great actor of great movies. This role should've been given to someone starting out as an actor. The only thrill I got out of watching this movie was the end! It couldn't have cost much of anything to make this movie.

The acting is great, but the story is incredibly boring If you really want to watch an ultra-low budget movie about a guy buried underground in a coffin with little if any hope of ever escaping, then this might be your cup of tea. Much of the dialogue is just plain contrived and stupid. We've all experienced computer voices on the other end of the phone, but not every single time we ring someone.

509,contactserge,"Started off interesting, ended disappointing.",4,11 April 2011,"The movie started off interesting with a man being buried alive in a coffin with no clear way out. Original idea that sucks you in with anticipation of watching Ryan Reynolds get out of this mess and back into the sunlight. Unfortunately, the rest of the sucking has nothing to do with excitement and everything with poor storyline that is full of logical flaws.The main, and practically only character of the movie had very limited resources in order to come back from the dead, and as such, he was rather wasteful in using both his cell phone and lighter as light sources together at the same time. Unless I'm the only one who doesn't hold a candle next to my phone when texting in the night, this just doesn't make sense to me.Second of all, I thought the main principle behind fire is it burns oxygen and when our friend Ryan complains of running out of air while talking on his phone and still burning the lighter, that seems rather silly.There are many other flaws with the film and unfortunately they are really the only thing worth talking about when discussing Buried as nothing else really happens. The entire movie is watching a man shuffle around in the coffin and then die.A good sequel to this would be putting a camera in someone's bedroom and recording them sleep. The movie would end with the person waking up.Going back to the flaws for a second, though, is burying a truck driver underground and leaving him with a cell phone really a good tactic to get them to pay 5 million dollars? Given the amount of long distance calls and sent video files from Reynolds' phone, the ""terrorists"" may want to ask for more than the 5 million just so that they can cover the phone bill with the Iraqi telecom company.",Buried

He is credible and does not overact.

As mentioned by the other reviews on here, Paul Conroy does everything you shouldn't do when stuck in a wooden box. I think he kept the zippo on for the sake of the viewers not watching a dark screen. There were many opportunities for him to attempt a rational escape and he had the tools and strength to do so (obviously there's enough oxygen for him to curse and shout, and kept the zippo lit even though the black berry screen was bright enough to see!) the knife was just there for him to commit suicide or cut a part of his body off...

Reynolds' convoy gets attacked and thus begins our movie, Reynolds' is buried alive in the middle of the desert with a very short amount of air left. My first problem with this film is how it is portrayed, the entire film is shot inside of the coffin, moments of the film where I would have shown flashbacks, did not happen. As a matter of fact, there is not a single flashback or any other scene in the entire film, so already I would have to give a thumbs down just on storytelling alone. As the film goes on, Reynolds makes plenty of phone calls, deals with cell phone battery issues and basically gets denied of any hope of getting out alive. Scenes where there should have been emotions, there was none, parts of the film got interesting but unfortunately it just did not deliver, very predictable and often drawn out for an intended but missed dramatic effect.The absolute most disappointing part of the film is that the idea behind it could have made for a very fun and well made movie but the director and the writers really wanted to make it into a political cry-fest.

Anyway he scares it off by throwing brandy from a hip-flask he completely consumed earlier in the film which burns a small fire in the corner of the coffin for a significant amount of time, yet he still has oxygen...The agent, Dan Brenner, who helps him on the phone sounds like he is talking in a commercial and despite having a lighter, fuel, a torch, cloth, a knife and a phone he makes no intelligent effort to escape.",Buried

I kept waiting for an explanation of where the extra air was coming from, since we are told many times he has limited air. No explanation ever comes. The acting isn't horrible but it isn't good either. Our protagonist should really be in a teen cut-em-up horror film since all he does is panic and swear. Oh and using alcohol to light the snake on fire and scare it off, that most certainly burned up the last oxygen... nope still going strong and stupid... making no effort to use the knife to dig out the side or something.

After reading a lot of the reviews on here, I decided to give this one a try. I am honestly surprised to see so many people on here voting this so high!! The entirety of this movie is filmed in a box. You immediately get thrown into this fiasco of a movie with NO background whatsoever, how he got there, who he is, or why should we even care that he is stuck in the box. The worst part is, it continues that way! The entirety of the movie never leaves the box; no cut out scenes, NOTHING. We learn absolutely nothing about him the entire movie, aside from having an emotional wife and a forgetful mother.Even worse, the main character, who isn't really likable in the first place, is a complete retard and doesn't listen to directions. ""Conserve your phone battery by taking it off silent"" - NOPE, Turns it back on. ""Dont use your zippo, it uses up oxygen"" - NOPE, keep it on while using your cell phone (which gives off more than enough light). About half-way through the movie, a snake appears, does absolutely nothing, and leaves. WTF? Being that he is only a few feet under ground, why he doesn't at least attempt to escape bewilders me. Instead the entire movie hypes up the fact that this FBI Agent, with a British accent mind you, finally finds him and saves his life with only a few seconds of time to spare!!

I would confidently award this waste of my life with a negative rating if such a rating was available. I have never in my life been so upset, distraught, and depressed with my existence after watching a film. I feel like my own mind has been trapped in a box full of sand. I was sure that after 90 min. of looking at the same confined space, and beginning to feel claustrophobic myself, that at least the ending would make it all worthwhile. But in fact it was the opposite. They could have MAYBE saved it by at least concluding with something even remotely positive or uplifting. Instead, all of this suspense and hope was just shattered with a non-climactic, pointless, low-budget, under-developed ending. Period.

But Ryans' performance is outstanding.With a great sense of suspense, we see how Paul Conroy, an American truck driver in Iraq, is trapped in a coffin underground after a ransom- kidnapping. A zippo lighter and a mobile phone with a nearly flat battery is all he has. With the help of inventive camera-work and a clever plot, we feel his hope, despair and rage.

Almost every movie like this has a good ending, it's getting stereotype and predictable, but that""s the beautiful thing about this movie: it's anything but stereotype and predictable. I admit that I also reacted like this because when you watch a good movie like this, it's like you live in the movie and you want a good ending for the protagonist.When you think about it: you wanted a good ending but you absolutely didn't expect this. That's what makes this movie so good: you live for one and a half hour with this person and you want everything to be alright with him. That's what they did really really good too: they make you feel that you want a good ending for the actor (like when he's talking to his wife) and when everything seems to go right you get surprised and very disappointed (for that moment).

I didn't understand why he cut off his finger, didn't know who the girl who got shot was, and it was just really confusing. I mean, some of the movie was okay, but some of the lines that Paul had to say were really odd; like he didn't even need to say them.

He owed this role.",8,21 August 2021,"Let me just say a movie timed with only one actor on screen all others were voices only on a cell phone. **SPOILERS*** in plot but not outcome. Just an amazing movie but all the writing, directing and effects would've NOTHING, without the incomparable Ryan Reynolds. You will have to admit to his award winning performance and that he's hooked us all. He commanded the screen, a preforming on screen cast of ONE - Ryan Reynolds all other cast were voice only on calls or memories. He WAS the movie and he owned it, I found myself, spell bound, angry, clawing and even crying during his call to Mom. . Filmed entirely in a wooden plank box, a coffin. Buried alive with nothing but a cell phone, a zippo lighter and a pencil. The scenario so far sounds incredibly blink. Now add that you can't remember hardly any numbers. So many you call are voicemail or answering machine. You have really no idea where you are buried just where your convoy was ambushed. You're in Iraq and discover you are being held for ransom. You've been buried alive and told by your captor you have until 9:00pm to get 5 million dollars or you will be left to die. You are a contractor working driving a truck you have no money and the US says we don't negotiate with terrorist. Everyone seems more concerned with covering their ass more than saving you. Don't talk to reporters and do make a ransom video you've been ordered to make, but why. Apparently to protect the private contractor you work for as a simple truck driver, the US Government who wants this kept quit and even the State Department in Iraq sworn to protect our citizens and private contractors, but you start to piece together the lies, the deception so who or what do you believe, NO ONE. You can't reach your wife, always voicemail here you are slowly losing oxygen, no promising hope of rescue so far and you can't hear the voice of your family, not your wife, not your son but you finally reach Mom but she has dementia and initialing doesn't know you. Can you get her to recognize you on the possible last conversation that might have with her, can you say I love you have her understand and tell you she loves you or will you only get the joy of hearing her voice. Then things are looking bleak wil you ever her the voice of the one you love again or will you die without that or will you be rescued and see her again. The longest and shortest time of your life. You alone, in a foreign country, buried in a wooden make shift coffin with a flask of whiskey, a cell phone, and a zippo that's all. As far as you know. Is there more? Can something else be there that could help you or just end your life before your oxygen is depleted. What now? Why? Trust your employer, the government or the agency set up 6 years prior to deal with this kidnap ransom cases. My takeaway, always tell those you care about that you love them none of us know our date of departure from this earthly plane, and most of all have a good solid no regret relationship with your Lord and Savior. Thank God for every sun rise, smell the flowers, nhelp a stranger, give more of yourself than you expect of others and live a good, healthy, thankful, God fearing life but filled with Gods love, forgiveness and joy. Our life could last 50 years or 100 years or end tomorrow so make the most of it, love your love ones, don't leave unfinished business and lay your head down each night feeling you made God, your self, your partner, your children and your parents proud. It's not about the amount of money you make or the recognition that you receive it is about knowing you lived your best life. Live your best self every day like it could be your last. We don't get do overs or a chance to come back to fix our mistakes. Live well, Laugh often and Love much. Gods love is a love without end, Amen.",Buried

One of the most impressive aspects of this film is the ability of the director to keep things interesting given a limited filming space.

It's not that stupid, because: 1. Take your pen and try it upside down before you go all smug about gravity. Mine writes perfectly well upside down, gravity or not.2. Obviously people don't realise that several feet under ground is still way too deep to accommodate any escape, it means a few tons of sand on top of you and as soon as you remove top planks of the coffin you are going to be buried immobile by the said tons of sand/earth. Actually, even if you are just buried up to your neck with your head sticking out and your arms not even three feet underground, you still can't break free because of the pressure of the sand.3. Yes the guy is stupid with his phone calls, but take a moment to think what you would do in his place. Chances are you won't be even able to cease panicking and blacking out, let alone start making any deliberate movements and holding conversations.The snake thing was dumb though, squishing it with the boots was no riskier than expelling it with fire (wtf). Lighting a Zippo all the time was stupid too, but without the Zippo we wouldn't have a movie to watch, so...All in all, I liked the movie, liked how disconnected all these people sitting in comfortable offices with airconditioning were from this guy in the coffin, and Ryan's performance was pretty believable to me and pretty hard to pull off given the setting. I was glued to the screen for 90 minutes. I won't watch it again but the experience was interesting.",Buried
551,cooksarah,"Hands down, worst movie I've seen",1,10 November 2016,"I never review, but this was so bad I had to. There's virtually no character development. Character developments is what moves you from neutral to empathy. Basically having a one character (aside from the voices on the phone calls & 2 really short videos he received) just flat out doesn't work. This could have EASILY been trimmed down to 1/2 & showed other characters (such as his wife/son, government agency, etc). The circumstances are the only thing that made me care. Imagining what it's like to be in that situation, man! Positives: Reynolds did a great job acting & the camera/lighting people were pretty genius. The list ends there though.If you haven't seen it, read on at your own risk. So many questions. How come the phone never died, even though he kept using it. battery life of a blackberry like that, isn't that good. I get that he probably had about 4 hours of oxygen or so & he had only been in there a couple of hours, but, wouldn't that have dramatically decreased with the zippo, especially with the fire he started! How did the wooden box not catch fire? I mean, he kept waving the thing around. The call from his employer, the message he left was for them to *69 bc At that point he didn't know the number, yet the agency he talked to that was trying to help him, said it came up unknown. If you *69 a number & it's unknown, it wouldn't go through right? (Maybe I'm just ignorant on the matter). He got mad at someone else for asking for is social security number, so why did he keep answering the stupid employer questions instead of hanging up. I think he would have just hung up. The snake came out of no where. I get that it came through the gap between slats, but, how come sand wasn't pouring through the gap? What was on the paper? The last 20 minutes was pretty suspenseful, otherwise it was a boring movie. I really would have liked to see his family, or even his wife's friend he talked to, someone, even if we only got to know the a little at the end. As it was, I didn't really care much about him. Had there been character development & he died, I might have been upset. As it was, I didn't really care.
