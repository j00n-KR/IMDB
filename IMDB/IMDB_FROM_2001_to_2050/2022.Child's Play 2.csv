0,TheLittleSongbird,Chucky's back,6,4 December 2018,"Saw 'Child's Play 2' as someone who appreciates horror while not considering it my favourite genre. Decided to recently watch and review all the films in the 'Child's Play'/Chucky series, having been intrigued for a long time by Chucky's horror icon status. A distinction that he does deserve.A strong example of a character being better than the films. The 'Child's Play'/Chucky films are very variable, with the first film being by far the best. None of the sequels are as good, but 'Child's Play 2' is one of the better and more watchable ones. Again this is not being seen through nostalgic lenses, all the 'Child's Play'/Chucky films were seen very recently, with being busy and having a long to watch and review list that is gradually being worked through but getting longer it just took me a while to get round to them.There are faults in 'Child's Play 2'. The story is predictable, due to being basically a retread of that of the first, can be silly and occasionally mean-spirited.While getting to the point quicker than the first film and faster paced, there is a rushed feel here. Also felt that whereas the first 'Child's Play' avoided going the cheesy, goofy and formulaic route that it could easily have done considering the premise, 'Child's Play 2' did feel formulaic and didn't completely escape the unintentionally silly trap.However, 'Child's Play 2' looks slick and suitably ominous, with even better photography and the special effects don't disappoint, they blend very well, look eerily life-like and move easily. Another standout in this regard is the genuinely eerie toy factory setting. The music is more ambitious and even more haunting here, it fits very well. While lacking the panache of Tom Holland's in the first 'Child's Play', John Lafia's direction is more than competent. The script is like the first 'Child's Play', darkly witty and clever with one-liners that are smart, frighteningly sarcastic and entertainingly twisted. There are two particularly great sequences in 'Child's Play 2', the garden burial of Chucky's replacement and especially the climax, the eeriness of the setting helps, that is clearly indebted to 'The Shining'.'Child's Play 2' is entertaining and is also creepy, with the attack scenes/kills and set pieces being creative and genuinely unsettling. Chucky is a character impossible to forget, the writers and effects team had the time of their lives clearly (as well as Brad Dourif of course). The other characters were ones worth caring for while Alex Vincent's acting has vastly improved here. Jenny Agutter is lovely as ever. The biggest acting plus though is Dourif, the personification of malevolence and is also wickedly funny. Christine Elise's heartfelt performance is a close second.In conclusion, inferior but one of the better sequels and films in the series. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Child's Play 2
1,Leofwine_draca,A rushed out sequel that lacks the first film's imaginative power,4,29 December 2015,"Sequels tend to fall into one of two broad categories. The first is the 'improvement' sequel that strives to outdo its predecessor – films like TERMINATOR 2, ALIENS and THE DARK KNIGHT fall into this category, one of my favourites. The second is the 'rip-off' sequel, the sole reason for which is to make money. These films typically rehash the plot from the first movie without adding anything new to the blend and look like nothing more than bland imitators. Sadly, CHILD'S PLAY 2 is the latter type of sequel, a weak imitation of the first movie lacking the same originality, narrative thrust and enjoyment.Things kick off at a toy factory where some manufacturers inexplicably revive Chucky, who was burned to a cinder at the end of the last flick. Soon enough he's back up and running, stalking Andy Barclay. What follows is in essence a series of cheesy deaths: people are stabbed, fall to their deaths, get electrocuted and in one instance are killed by a ruler. Unfortunately such moments feel tired and drawn out and this is a film that feels like it's in search of a plot. The only thing that holds it together is Brad Dourif, having a ball once more as the voice of Chucky. Alex Vincent also returns from the first but he seems more morose and restrained there; either he was bored with the role or told to act' subdued'.With Alex's mother written out of the movie, we're introduced to a bland foster couple – there's nothing much to get out of the sheer boredom of these guys, which is a shame because two cult favourites play them; Gerrit Graham and Jenny Agutter, both wasted with nothing of what made them so memorable in the first place. The cheesy, extended finale is more yawn-inducing than inspiring this time around, as we've already seen all the Chucky-isn't-dead-is-he scares. Special effects are adequate but the low budget is apparent in many scenes, especially the non-starter of a car crash which is laughably bad. In all this is a worthless remake in a series filled with pretty uninteresting, undeserving films; apparently the rushed-out sequel is even worse. Stay tuned...",Child's Play 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Still a good slasher movie,6,19 October 2014,"Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is placed with foster parents Joanne (Jenny Agutter) and Phil Simpson (Gerrit Graham) and fellow foster kid Kyle (Christine Elise). His mother has been committed to psychiatric observation. The toy company reassembles the Good Guys doll Chucky to disprove the tabloid murdering doll story. As soon as the doll is finished, it electrocutes a worker. Mattson (Greg Germann) is told to get rid of the doll which still has the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray. Chucky kills Mattson and then tracks down Andy.This movie doesn't have the surprise reveal of the original. Everybody knows who Chucky is except the characters in the movie. This is simply a slasher movie and it does a good job at that. There is good tension as Andy tries and fails to convince the adults. It's nice that Alex Vincent returns to reprise the role of Andy. The audience does want the mother to return but that's not to be. It would have been great to see her escape and come to the rescue like Sarah Connor.",Child's Play 2
3,gavin6942,A Modern Classic Horror Sequel,7,9 May 2013,"Chucky's back as the doll possessed by the soul of a serial killer, butchering all who stand in his way of possessing the body of a boy.Let me just get this out of the way: the premise of this film is pretty bizarre. I understand a toy company wanting to check the dolls for quality control -- but if you have a doll burned as badly as Chucky was, why would you bother to replace his parts and fix him? It would be much easy (and probably less expensive) to just make a new one. But then, we would not have this movie... so just go with it.I love that it was directed by John Lafia (one of the original film's writers), because I appreciate sequel continuity -- keeping the same actors, writers and more. Lafia helped create Chucky, he certainly has every right to direct him.I also loved the attempt to make us feel like we were really in Chicago, including using a ""Chicago Sun-Times"" van. Other than the railroad crossing in the opening credits, this was all shot in California. But maybe you cannot tell... (the original was shot in Chicago, by the way)",Child's Play 2
4,lee_eisenberg,school ties,7,13 March 2009,"Anyone who has seen the original should know what to expect in ""Child's Play 2"". A particularly nasty scene takes place in Andy's (Alex Vincent) classroom; seriously, was the boy even allowed to watch the movie after that scene?!. A real surprise here is the presence of Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London"") and Gerrit Graham (Beef in ""Phantom of the Paradise"") as Andy's foster parents, particularly with what Chucky does to the dad on the staircase leading to the basement.Yes, it is a sequel, so it's even harder to take seriously than the original was, but this is truly a good time. You probably won't be sorry that you watched it. As long as you can handle some of the scenes (of course you can; that's why you watch these sorts of movies!).Also starring Beth Grant and of course, Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky.",Child's Play 2
5,jboothmillard,Child's Play 2,4,7 July 2007,"The first film in the series caused a big buzz, in both good and bad ways, so a sequel starring the infamous antagonist seemed almost inevitable, this followed two years after the original. Basically it has been two years since the events of the first film, the remains of Chucky the doll, possessed by the soul of ""The Lakeshore Strangler"", Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) (named after Charles Manson, Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray), has been recovered and reconstructed by Play Pals Inc. They have had bad publicity because of the events reported, they have put the doll back together for analysis, and to prove to the public there was nothing wrong with it. Of course they are unaware that the soul of Ray still inhabits the doll, so he comes back to life soon enough. Chucky is after the child he tried to transfer his soul into before, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), now eight years old and in foster care, as his mother is in a psychiatric hospital, declared insane for her claims. Andy is living with foster parents Joanne Simpson (An American Werewolf in London's Jenny Agutter) and Phil Simpson (Gerrit Graham). Also living with them is teenage orphan Kyle (Christine Elise), who has been transferred to numerous foster homes due to her trouble making. Chucky manages to track Andy down, he finds another Good Guy Doll is in the house, he switches himself with it. Andy is paranoid about the Good Guy Doll, and fearful that Chucky will return. Sure enough, Chucky ties him up and attemps to transer his soul, until the parents interrupt, assuming Kyle is responsible. The next day, Andy goes to his new school, Chucky follows him and gets him into trouble with teacher Miss Kettlewell (Donnie Darko's Beth Grant), writing an expletive on his test paper. Andy is put in detention, but manages to escape the classroom before Chucky can get to him, Mrs. Kettlewell is killed by Chucky. The killer doll returns to the house, Phil is the next victim, but still no-one believes the little boy's story that the doll is responsible. Kyle discovers the truth, she uncovers the original Good Guy Doll buried in the back yard, but Chucky holds her at gunpoint, demanding she takes him to the Foster Centre. Andy tries to escape, but Chucky takes him by force to the nearby Play Pals Inc. factory, to attempt to transfer his soul into Andy's body. But the incantation ritual fails, Chucky has a nose bleed and realises he is trapped inside the doll body. Enraged, he tries to kill Andy and Kyle, chasing them through the factory, losing his hand in the process, replacing it with a knife blade. After losing his legs as well, Chucky is splashed by heated plastic mould until apparently dead, he springs to life one more time, before getting an air hose shoved into his mouth, he is inflated until he explodes, and Andy and Kyle walk out relieved it is over. Also starring Grace Zabriskie as Grace Poole, Peter Haskell as Sullivan and Greg Germann as Mattson. As before Vincent is cute as the little boy trying to convince everyone of the evil doll chasing him, and the puppet techniques and menacing and wisecracking vocals of Dourif make Chucky the star of the film. It is fair to say that this follow up is almost the same thing all over again, but the deaths are inventive and fun, the finale in the toy factory is a nice touch, and Chucky is always good value, a predictable but not completely terrible horror. Okay!",Child's Play 2
6,BA_Harrison,Homici-doll Maniac.,7,6 March 2012,"For much of the time, Child's Play 2 takes the predictably safe sequel route, delivering more of the same, albeit with higher production values, better special effects and a touch more gore; it's formulaic and reasonably fun popcorn entertainment, but one cannot help wish that the makers had been just a little more daring with a concept that offers a lot of creative potential.Thankfully, after an hour or so of fairly routine horror nonsense in which Chucky stalks Andy and murders those around him, director John Lafia ups his game for a rousing finale set amidst the factory machinery of the Good Guys assembly line, a locale that allows for plenty of action, excitement and peril, and provides a suitably cool demise for the murderous doll.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Child's Play 2
7,Coventry,"""No more Mr. Good Guy-doll !""",4,31 August 2003,"You don't have to be Nostradamus to predict a sequel to the original and creepy film by Tom Holland was inevitable. The soul of a psycho-killer inside a doll was a big hit at the box-office and you know what that means...More from the same!! And fast! But hey, who's complaining? Child's Play 2 is fairly good. Some nice twists, several funny moments and a few very original killings. What more could you ask for in a horror sequel? Story doesn't matter. In fact, can you call this a story ? Chucky comes back to life and continues to chase Andy to take over his soul. He has to kill everyone who comes too close to him and his secret and every time he's about to call Dumballah ( or whatever ), he gets interrupted. Voilà, there you have the plot of Child's Play 2. Original ? No. Entertaining ? Yes, very. Jenny Agutter plays the role of Andy's foster mom. I tell you, she still is as adorable as when she played her role in American Werewolf in London...only older, of course. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky and he seems to enjoy that very much. That's about all there is to say about Child's Play 2. Certainly not a ""urgently need-to-see movie"" but pure fun if you come across it on TV or something. It's recommended to watch the first two films in a row. Child's Play 3, however, should be avoided like the plague...yuk. The more recent Bride of Chucky uses a whole other style, but surely is worth a look. I'm quite sure more sequels have yet to come...",Child's Play 2
8,Theo Robertson,Rather Mediocre Sequel,5,23 August 2008,Did someone say Universal Studios bought the rights to CHILD'S PLAY from MGM ? If so I'd say it was MGM who showed business savvy . The original - which I haven't seen in years - does contain instinctively fond memories but I'm not sure to give much credence to my memories . I should also point out there's a very 80s seen it all before feel to this sequel . Wise cracking monsters that murder and mutilate humans ? We saw that in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and HELLRAISER franchises . Was anyone expecting this type of horror to last well in to the 21st Century ? neither did I . Pity Universal Studios didn't give me a job because I could have stopped them losing money There's also another aspect that's wrong and that's the audience identification . The story revolves around possessed doll Chucky trying to track down a young boy called Andy . Hmmm a horror film where the audience are supposed to relate to a child ! Fair enough if it was a children's movie but it's not so couldn't the producers come up with the protagonist being a more mature character ? To be fair they do have a teenage girl as the heroine but she's not technically the main character . Couldn't Andy have been dropped altogether in the draft stage and have Kyle as the protagonist ? There's also a feel that there's a fair bit of slumming from the cast . I've no idea why Brad Dourif didn't become a big name after ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and show's you how far he fell when he's probably best remembered as being the voice of Chucky instead of his roles in NEST and THE TWO TOWERS . Jenny Agutter is a surprise casting choice being a well known name and the fact that her character's death receives no build up or impact aesthetic tell's you all you need to know as to how ill thought out this mediocre sequel is,Child's Play 2
9,Hey_Sweden,Everything's Chucky.,7,1 March 2020,"This sequel picks up some time after the events of the first movie. Traumatized Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent, now boosted to top billing) is now having to room with foster parents because his mom was institutionalized after backing up her sons' wild story. (The cops involved all denied anything weird ever happened.) Surprise, surprise: The Play Pals toy company is now looking to dispel the negative publicity surrounding their Good Guy doll, and in so doing, they manage to resurrect the evil Chucky. In no time at all, Chucky has tracked Andy to his foster home, and continues to terrorize him.Admittedly, this is pretty routine as horror sequels go, although at this point it was still amusing to see an angelic-looking doll burst into uncontrollable rages and spew profanity like a veteran sailor. To be sure, there are patently unbelievable moments, but this viewer can tolerate the whole ""suspension of disbelief"" concept better than some. Kudos to the filmmakers (Chucky creator Don Mancini scripts, and John Lafia, one of the men credited with the screenplay for the first movie, directs) for telling a basically entertaining story and keeping up the pace almost non-stop. End credits notwithstanding, this only runs about 81 minutes or so. This viewer would NOT consider it ""worthless"", but agrees that the highlight is the doll factory finale. Andy and foster sibling Kyle (Christine Elise) have conveniently ended up at the Play Pals toy headquarters, and do battle with the demonic Chucky using the immediate means at their disposal. In time-honoured horror movie tradition, the villain will need to be ""killed"" multiple times before finally expiring (that is, until the next sequel comes along). I did enjoy the way that Mancini, Lafia, and company strengthen Andy somewhat; he goes so far as to take proactive steps at one point.Worthy components include Ivo Cristante's production design, Stefan Czapsky's cinematography, and Graeme Revell's ominous, thunderous score. The cast won't blow you away, but they treat their material with gravity: Jenny Agutter and Gerrit Graham (admittedly, an unlikely couple) as the foster parents, Grace Zabriskie as the head of the foster agency, Peter Haskell as grumpy, hostile Play Pals head honcho Sullivan, Beth Grant as ill-fated teacher Ms. Kettlewell, and Greg Germann as a company exec and fodder for the pint-sized psycho. Young Vincent handles starring duties with a decent amount of poise for a child actor. Brad Dourif again tears all scenery to pieces with his loud, intense utterances of Chucky's lines. (And, of course, Chucky tends to get the best lines.)Granted, it was already no longer a great shock or gimmick to see the doll morph from harmless to harmful - we'd already seen Chucky in action numerous times - but the effects remain impressive. One kill will remind horror buffs of a similar scene in 1989s' ""Cutting Class"".Followed just a year later by ""Child's Play 3"".Seven out of 10.",Child's Play 2
10,Doylenf,Chucky is back with a vengeance...pretty fair sequel for horror fans...,6,29 December 2006,"Chucky is one of those dolls that can't stay dead, still inhabited by an evil spirit. The little boy he turned into an orphan is leaving the clinic now that he's over the traumatic situation (or so the head of the clinic tells his adoptive parents). His adoptive parents take him home and you know things aren't going to settle down when a Chucky doll drops from the top shelf of a closet he's exploring.The evil Chucky doll finds his way to the household, switches places with the toy doll and buries it, setting the stage for things to come. Credibility really is strained by the time we get to the schoolroom scene where Chucky has followed the boy to school, lands magically in his classroom and manages to start trouble between the boy and the teacher, who subsequently gets killed by Chucky after the boy has climbed out a window. Takes quite an imagination to think of these plot lines, but when the imagination runs wild plausibility begins to suffer. Following the schoolhouse segment, the bizarre incidents keep piling up as Chucky gets away with more and more havoc and no one believes the boy is telling the truth--just as in the original.None of the incidents are as startling or as well staged as in CHILD'S PLAY, but it still manages to hold the interest with some original touches tinged with fright and a weird sense of humor. Especially good are the effects toward the end when Chucky holds the spunky adopted girl and boy captive as the story speeds toward an ending in the toy factory. The factory sequence has some grotesque chills as one of the workers gets caught up in the doll machinery and Chucky himself suffers quite a few ""happenings"" at the toy factory before he's liquidated by the boy.Entertaining nonsense despite the strain on credibility.",Child's Play 2
11,preppy-3,Easily one of the WORST horror sequels ever!,1,6 July 2006,"Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is placed in a foster home after the incidents of the first film had his mother committed. However Chucky comes back--he needs Andy's body to come back to life (or something like that). What follows is a boring, by the numbers, stalk and slash horror film with a killer toy.Dull and boring with a pretty talented cast (Jenny Agutter especially) giving their all time worst performances. There are ENDLESS sequences of a person searching for Chucky...only to have him spring out at them. This happens at least eight times! Also having a 9 year old boy seeing people murdered around him left and right is in questionable taste. Boring, stupid, not even remotely scary. I saw this back in 1990 at a theatre and I STILL remember how bad it was! You can skip this one.",Child's Play 2
12,poolandrews,"Good sequel, I rather liked it.",6,16 December 2007,"Child's Play 2 is again set in Chicago & starts shortly after the events of the original, the Good Guy company has suffered a lot of bad publicity due to their doll being implicated in the murders committed in the first film & to disprove these claims the company rebuilds the Good Guy doll from the burnt remains which again becomes possessed by the serial killer Charles Lee Ray & comes to life. Meanwhile Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) has been placed in a care home after his mom goes into psychiatric care, he is adopted for a short time by Joanne (Jenny Agutter) & Phil Simpson (Geritt Graham) who make him welcome in their home. Chucky the possessed Good Guy doll finds out where Andy is now living & sets out to exchange souls before he is trapped in the Good Guy doll forever...Directed by John Lafia this was the sequel to the surprise hit Child's Play (1988) & for what it is it's a rather enjoyable follow up, in fact I think it's a slightly better film than the original. The script by Don Mancini is far more serious in tone than the later sequels despite some foul mouthed one-liners uttered by Chucky, Child's Play 2 feels much more like a standard slasher horror film franchise sequel than the two most recent entries & as far as standard horror sequels go it's pretty good. The character's are good, the dialogue is fine & I particularly liked the storyline here. The idea behind how Chucky is resurrected is rather clever & actually works really well, I really liked the ending set in the doll making factory as Andy & Kyle dodge automated machines, the way Andy is brought back & Chucky's quest to transfer his soul into his body makes for a fun way to pass 80 odd minutes. It moves along like a rocket, there are some good kill scenes although the body count is a bit low for my liking & I'd have liked to have seen a bit more blood & gore but since this was a major studio picture from the 90's the lack of blood doesn't come as much of a surprise. A pleasant surprise & better than I had expected.Director Lafia does a fine job here, it's not the most stylish film ever made but there's a few creepy moments & it's very well made. The special effects are very good, the way Chucky is brought to life by animatronic puppets is pretty convincing. Thhere aren't really any special effects you can point to & say they were bad, I'm not happy about the lack of gore effects though with only a stabbing, a factory worker having his eyeballs replaced with dolls eyes & a messy demise for Chucky himself the only real gory death's. The film has some nice horror scenes & a few jump out of your seat moments, whenever the foul mouthed Chucky is on screen the film comes to life & it becomes very watchable & good fun.With a pretty big sounding budget of about $13,000,000 Child's Play 2 was actually a well funded film, it's very well made with good special effects & good production values. Shot in Illinois in Chicago. The acting is good by all involved, I'm not sure what an actress like Jenny Agutter is doing in this though & despite her near top billing barley features & is killed off before the 50 minute mark.Child's play 2 is a much better film & sequel than I had expected, it's nothing amazing but at least it's enjoyable if taken for what it is. Followed by Child's Play 3 (1991) before the series took a different direction with Bride of Chucky (1998) & Seed of Chucky (2004) while a remake of the original Child's Play (2009) has been announced.",Child's Play 2
13,lastliberal,You've been very naughty Miss Kettlewell.,6,10 October 2007,"Writer Don Mancini continues the story alone as Chucky magically returns from the dead and continues his quest to assume the body of Alex Vincent, who is now in a foster home. What happened to his mom? Jenny Agutter (The Parole Officer, Darkman) joins Grace Zabriskie (Inland Empire) and veteran actress, Beth Grant, as the horror is ramped up, bodies are sacrificed to complete the mission, and a final exciting climax in the Good Guy factory ensues.I don't know how Chucky was reborn, and I certainly don't know hoe he survives this one - but he apparently does, as there is a Chucky 3, 4, and 5 to look forward to.",Child's Play 2
14,Boba_Fett1138,Better made than the first one.,7,26 October 2011,"Call me crazy but I totally prefer this movie over the original. It's a better constructed movie, with a better build-up to it, more slasher ingredients and a more insane and evil Chucky.Of course it's not a perfect movie and it isn't even all that great as an horror but I really enjoyed watching it. The concept of having a killer doll is of course a ridicules one but the movie makes great use of it. It does so by making Chucky this time even more evil and there are quite a lot of kills in this movie. And some pretty good ones as well, which is not something I could say about the first and original ""Child's Play"" movie, made 2 years earlier. In that regard this movie already works better as a slasher and horror movie than the first one ever did.But I also thought the story was way better this time, which caused the movie to flow better and more naturally. All of the kills and horror were pretty much forced into the first movie but in this movie it feels far more like it's a part of the story. No, it's not a brilliantly written story or even a very original one, it just simply allows the movie its pace and build-up to work out quite good and pleasantly.Another thing that really surprised me was its musical score. I don't even remember the first movie having a musical score at all but in this one it's pretty notable. Graeme Revell did a great job with it and it truly helps to make some of the movie its moments to stand out.One of the things that wasn't as good as in the first movie though was its acting. It stars the same young boy played by Alex Vincent again but in the first movie I was quite impressed with his performance, while in this one he's quite horrible to be honest. He never shows any emotions and pretty much has the same look on his face, throughout the entire movie. It doesn't matter if he's playing scared, sad, happy. or neutral. I don't know how this happened but perhaps it was because this movie got done by a different director. Maybe John Lafia just couldn't direct kids as well as Tom Holland.But overall I can see myself watching this movie over and over again, while I probably won't ever see the first movie again, any time soon.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Child's Play 2
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Contains an obscene amount of 'fake' scares and not much plot, but a worthy sequel",6,21 March 2005,"Following the success of the first Child's Play Don Mancini was asked to write a sequel. Not much later, he was asked to write a third film of the franchise. He said it impacted his writing, as he was out of ideas after writing this one. Well, how many ideas did he have before, exactly? The first had a fairly good plot, but this has the unlucky fate of being the second film in a series of films that started with an idea that only really allowed for one film. The same could be said of Terminator 2, but James Cameron worked that out nicely, by directing a sequel that was almost a remake. But enough about that. Where this movie goes wrong plot-wise is by using a cheap ploy to put Andy, our main character, in basically the exact same situation that he was in the first film; knowing that the doll was alive but no one believing him. That worked well in the first film, partly because we weren't sure if Chucky was alive for a while. Here, it's just a cheap ploy to ensure that no one will help Andy. Of course, this installation also suffers under the curse of sequels to horror movies; everything needs to be bigger(because 'bigger is better'). More deaths, more gruesome death scenes and, for some reason, more obscenities. It might be because Chucky talks more for this one, but he seemed to swear more randomly as well. And why was he suddenly so bloody lighthearted? Early in the film, he seemed to laugh every five seconds. Anyway, the deaths are nicely done, and the fact that there are more of them doesn't bother me(I am a horror fan, after all). It's more how they are virtually ignored or written off by characters in the film. In the first film, the deaths were few and far between, and they looked like accidents. Here, the bodies pile up, and it's clear to anyone that these are intentional killings. Which leads me to a gaping plot hole; in the first, we were told that he was a psychopath and a killer. The killings weren't expanded upon. Here, we're told that he, being the voodoo aficionado that he is, killed them ritually. Now, if he did that when he was alive, why does he settle for just killing people now that he's dead? I mean, he does go out of his way to kill people, but now he doesn't care about the voodoo stuff anymore? What gives? Now, as the one line summary of my comment tells you, this has grotesque amounts of 'fake' scares. For anyone who doesn't know what that means, it's getting a cheap jump-scare out of the viewers through something that has nothing to do with the actual horror of the film. Cat jumping down from high point, friend appearing suddenly from behind character, etc. You know them, I know them, and we(by 'we' I mean us horror fans) all hate them. The plot is somewhat good, what little there is of it, though too much of it is just to set up new Chucky scenes, either involving him going after Andy or killing off one or more of the many characters that have the words 'I'm going to be killed off' printed on their foreheads from the moment we see them(...not literally, of course). Which brings me to the point of the characters. They are somewhat well-written and credible, but they are in no way interesting or likable(with the exception of Andy and Kyle), making them uninteresting victims(where's the fun in seeing you don't care about getting killed?) and they, like the plot, are written around how Chucky acts, to protect him and his 'mission' from interference. The acting is good enough, with Christine Elise and Alex Vincent, the kid who plays Andy being the only two who transcend the mediocre level of acting that everyone else seems to stay at. The special effects have clearly evolved quite a lot since the first, and it makes the Chucky scenes more pleasing to the eye. The end is about as overdone as the first one. All in all, probably only a film for the people who really liked the first. If you only 'kind of' enjoyed the first, you probably won't like this one... unless you thought what the first lacked was more death and less plot. I recommend this to fans of the first and of horror in general. I don't advise anyone to watch this if you haven't seen the first yet, though. Not only is the first a better film, it sets the tone for this pretty well and contains a lot of plot that this doesn't summarize for new viewers. 6/10",Child's Play 2
16,view_and_review,Looking for Andy Again,7,23 March 2020,"Chucky (Brad Dourif) may not be the most prolific killer due to his diminutive size, but he is the most entertaining. He has the funniest lines.I was wondering, going in, how Chucky would make a comeback being that he was shot to death and charred to a crisp. Well, he was given a full restoration much like a vintage automobile. That led to the question of: why would they restore him? The reason was actually a fairly good one. The company wanted to restore him to see if there was any validity to the claims made by Andy and his mother.Even still, restoring Chucky wouldn't be enough to bring him back to life. Well, for that we had an electrical event of some kind. Electricity often seems to be that magical energy to bring things to life: Frankenstein, Jason Voorhese TWICE, and now Chucky.Once Chucky was re-animated it was time for him to find Andy (Alex Vincent) again and once again attempt his body swapping ceremony. By this time Andy is going to need lifelong professional help. A killer doll has gone after him twice and no one ever believes him. Even if Chucky doesn't kill him Andy will have such a miserable life he may wish he was dead. As it is, Chucky found Andy in a foster home because his mother was deemed mentally unfit to parent him. Then, when Chucky came around doing his wicked stuff Andy was being blamed. Chucky may have inadvertently created a serial killer in Andy.Andy and fellow foster child, Kyle (Christine Elise), won in the end. After Chucky killed six people and tried unsuccessfully to do the soul swap, Andy and Kyle dumped hot plastic on Chucky then overinflated him until he exploded. Where they possibly went after that, I'll never know.",Child's Play 2
17,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Execellent conclusion to entertaining sequel,9,22 October 2015,"Recreated into a new doll-form, Chucky resumes his quest to steal Andy's soul who's now living with a foster family and has to convince them to believe him in order to stop his rampage to get to Andy.This one was quite the enjoyable and highly entertaining sequel. What really works here is pretty much a lot of what worked in the original in being reliant on whether the doll is alive or not, managing to some pretty fun times here in keeping the truth hidden quite a long time here. Not only does this one have the trauma inflicted from the original, but there's a lot of retread here in the first half of copying tactics where he does something that ends up framing the kid for what happened, making for some rather decent times with the broken statue, his teacher at school and finally the incident in his bedroom where he's found tied-up with Chucky and no possible way he did it to himself which makes the eventual stumbling across it quite nicely done here. While none of these have the power of the original, they give this a solid- enough start here that when this one turns into a slasher there's some great parts already on display with this one. Starting with the teacher in her classroom and the father in the basement, there's some great stalking scene that make this one quite fun as the kidnapping from the orphanage and resulting car chase to rescue him leads into the grand final half. The utterly freaky stalking in the factory upon hundreds of boxes of dolls, the various stalking around the conveyor belts s they barely manage to escape him each time, the fine kills and lastly the triple-stacked measures needed to finally put him down give this one plenty of action, some nice suspense when necessary and a bit of cheese to make this one interesting enough that it's not all that stale throughout. These here are good enough even with a few minor problems. The main one is that it tends to feel very much like the original as it plays with the same overall set-up, just not quite as powerful at doing so. The other factor against this one is the rather noticeable lack of kills here in the first half as it keeps the truth hidden away during this time so it keeps the body count a little undervalued in this section. Beyond these small facets, there's a lot to like here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, children-in-jeopardy and underage drug use.",Child's Play 2

Performances are okay, but this this is all about Chucky, and you get your fix in droves.Probably the best in the series.",Child's Play 2
19,Aaron1375,This movie in the Child's Play series seemed all about having Chucky in pain.,5,15 July 2009,"This movie is not as strong as the first movie, but what does one expect? You have seen this before so the surprise is gone and the plot remains basically the same. Nothing is really added to this movie to really distinguish it from the first movie. I never saw part III, but from what I have seen they did try to do at least one thing different by having the kid from these two movies all grown up in what is the span of three years. He hit one of those growth spurts like the baby on the Family Ties television series I am thinking. This movies highlight is the end of the film where we get to see the kid and this girl put Chucky through a whole heck of a lot, yet he keeps coming after the kid. Seriously, you have to give your props to Chucky for hanging in there, he would have been put through a lot less pain had he simply stayed an evil doll. However, that would not have made for good cinema I suppose, then again aside from the first film in this series of movies I would say none of them were particularly good cinema. Then again you get to see Chucky screaming in misery as those two crazy kids use the toy factory against him.",Child's Play 2
20,StevePulaski,Chucky's Back!,9,15 July 2010,"Before the franchise went to mainly comical jokes and having the scare level of a child in a ghost costume, Childs Play was a Horror franchise we sense and style. This is one of the last true Childs Play films in the entire franchise that took on a creepy tone to it. The rest took the ""Elm Street"" route, having the character say cheesy catchphrases and have the funny dialogue be the main focus rather than the scares. Still, this one balanced it out perfectly. Enough scares and satire to even out the whole movie. It also stands as a worthy sequel.Andy Barclay is sent to a foster home while is mother takes time in recovery from their last encounter with the doll killer. He is taken by a family of three, Joanne and Phil Simpson, and their teenage daughter Kyle. Andy quickly find Chucky in the house and is petrified to go near him. The family's stress level goes over the top with only Kyle understanding the true pain Andy is facing with the doll. The movie has some great scares in a classroom scene and one of the best, most intense end scenes, I've ever seen. Almost has the adrenaline filled ending to the 1994 movie, Speed.Like I said, this is the last creepy film in the Childs Play franchise. The rest were more of a Horror Comedy, or Black Comedy than the first two which was a shame. It makes me wonder, how would both Nightmare and Childs Play turned out if they the entire franchise was one creepy film after the next. The same fate unfolded for the Leprechaun franchise. By the fourth one (Leprechaun 4: In Space) they started to take a turn for the ultimate worst and become cheesy, laughable, unbelievably bad movies. Then the following sequels (which were the last two) took place strictly in the hood or ghetto, which was the cemented end of the franchise. I was surprised after the green fellow went to space the series carried on. Space is a sign of a dead end and a plead for new ideas. Luckily Chucky hasn't visited the galaxy yet.Starring: Alex Vincent, Jenny Agutter, Gerrit Graham, Christine Elise, and Brad Dourif. Directed by: John Lafia.",Child's Play 2

I think just for the sake that I saw the first one and something must have been special because I am curious how the series goes. One of my friends also said that I have to see ""Bride"" and ""Seed"" for the Chucky series, but I didn't want to see those without understanding maybe a few things I missed in the third or second Child's Play.Some silly deaths occur in this movie, like the teacher's. I mean, did anyone look at that as more of a porn movie than a horror flick? ""You've been very naughty Mrs. Kettlewell!"", slapping the ruler? You'll see what I mean. I just thought that it was very funny instead of gruesome and also very unbelievable. But then again, I wasn't looking for Oscar material.

22,KineticSeoul,It's a decent continuation with Chucky,7,5 June 2014,"I thought the way they revived Chucky after they over-killed Chucky in the first installment was kinda dumb. They replaced the whole Chucky doll except the shell for the head and apparently that is enough for the soul of Charles Lee Ray to make it back into the doll. The first one worked because of it's originality and mystery for the most part. Although the audiences knew what was going on the characters wasn't sure what to think. This time the protagonist Andy knows about Chucky and what he is capable of. After the first movie Andy is put into foster care since his mother got sent to a mental asylum. Anyways Chucky is back and he is back to his old mischievous tricks again of playing just a doll and sneaking around to kill people. The first one had meat to it and knew what direction to take with what they had. This time around it just didn't really seem to have a sense of direction. However I still give this one credit, because after the the first installment ending this one was a logical direction to take. Unless they wanted to start over with another group of family that buys the doll, but that would just be a rehash. This time Chucky is back for vengeance and for Andy's body. Most of this movie seemed pretty mundane with almost no suspense or cool Chucky moments (few slightly clever moments, but nothing really stand out) despite the signature Chucky laughs. The death scenes are also bland this time around. The first installment had parts that didn't make much sense, there is actually a lot of those moments in this one. The plot didn't really seem to have a sense of direction. It basically revolves around Andy's life after the event of the first film while he is paranoid of Chucky. And nobody believing him when it came to his stories. The premise and relationships seemed to have more development this time around. When the final act kicks in though in the toy factory things start to pick up for the better. While the first one tried to go in a more serious horror direction this one lightens up a bit which I am not quite sure if it's a good thing or not. All in all this is a alright sequel with few clever Chucky moments and few laughs because of Andy's reactions (although I am not sure if it was intentional or not). Watch the first Chucky movie first before seeing this one in order to get the full gist of what is going on.7.3/10",Child's Play 2
23,OllieSuave-007,A rather entertaining horror sequel.,8,20 October 2016,"The not-so-innocent movie about a child's doll continues with Andy Barkley (Alex Vincent) being sent to live in a foster care home while his mom is recovering from a mental hospital. Nobody believes Andy's story about Chucky the killer doll, but that soon changes when the doll returns, possessed once again by serial killer Charles Lee Ray. It goes on another rampage, this time trying to free his evil soul from the doll and transfer into Andy's body.The plot's pacing, script, and music score work fine in this movie, with a some good humor and suspense, and some creepy moments. The acting was pretty good for the most part - especially enjoyed the characters of Andy and Kyle. Vincent portrayed Andy with innocence but determination and Christine Elise gave a rebellious yet tender-hearted and strong portrayal of foster teenager Kyle. Brad Dourif gave another sinister, dark, and sarcastically funny portrayal of Chucky.The overall horror elements may seem tame by more recent standards, but it's still a rather entertaining horror sequel.Grade B",Child's Play 2
24,thesar-2,Who's Jack? And why is he sorry?,2,17 October 2009,"Whereas #1 was fun, adventurous, original (to a point) and scary, 'Child's Play 2' plays out like a 'Friday the 13th' sequel. One of the bad chapters. It's almost half-believable how Jason kept coming back, if you suspend your disbelief to the max, but how Chucky is resurrected from the definite end in #1 is downright hilariously bad. But if you can overlook that, you get horrible camera wide-angles that are annoying, clichéd characters, predictable kills and props and literal overkill. And Andy? The actor, Vincent, though probably pleased to return, seems like he slept-walked through this movie, especially the closing. Here's the so-called synopsis: Chucky's Back as some of the titles indicate. He's back to transfer his soul into little Andy so he doesn't have to stay a doll, a position he put himself in, in #1. But will anyone believe Andy, now in foster care since his mother in #1, Hicks, refused to return? Probably not. This movie is seriously a no-brainer, or the writers were. Either way, it should be skipped. Thankfully, it's a short release, but the little substance it has hardly make up the 84 minute running time. Honestly, I can't say much nice, but maybe the girl, Kyle (who seemed like a character pulled from 'Friday the 13th part V') was a tiny bit interesting, but unfortunately, the foster dad (who seemed like a character pulled from 'Friday the 13th part VII') was anything but. Yes, Chucky is fun to watch, but not young kids smoking, which seemed real. Skip. In fact, watch part 1, jump to 'Bride of Chucky' and quit the series. Of all 5, so far, those are the only valuable ones.",Child's Play 2

To get an idea of what had happened with their doll; Play Pal toys decide to rebuild Chucky to prove there's nothing wrong with it. Although a freak electrical current kills one of their employees and revives the doll. Knowing that he has to get out this body, Chucky goes about trying to locate Andy, so he can transfer his soul into his body.The lovable, foul-mouthed good guy doll is back at it again in this far from surprising sequel spawned by the original's success. Old habits die young in this basically unnecessary no frills retread of the original film. Actually, the horrifying thing is that I don't mind this effort. It's still my favourite sequel of the series, just ahead of ""Bride of Chucky"". Directing his debut feature with plenty of verve and focus happens to be John Lafia (co-writer of the screenplay for Child's Play), who ups the ante in mostly every department. There's more hectically nervy mayhem, spur of the moment thrills and rather a mean spirited vibe worked in. Chucky's one sadistic little monster here and it seems to exploit its premise for the sheer of it. Popping up are many amusing moments that are plain rib tickling and a few unexpected splashes of suspense. The nastily inspired and glaring death scenes are well thought out. Time breezes by because of tight pacing and crisp editing. The silliness of the concept is simply taken to the extreme with constant use of smarting one-liners and devilish puns. The tongue is heavily planted in cheek within its jest-like tone.Written again by original creator Don Mancini. The straightforward script nicely rounds off what had happened to the major players of the first film and how Chucky was resurrected. After that it goes for a basic stalk and slash formula with more blood and violence to cover up systematic gimmick. Instead of the icy cold Chicago downtown setting this time Mancini decides to go suburbia on this foray. While, it's cliché bound and everything about this one looks plastic. It's commendably made production with a glossily bright tinge to the set designs (like the surreal-like toy factory). The slick photography by Stefan Czapsky is lithely orchestrated and Graham Revell's ominous sounding music score hits all the right chords. Kevin Yagher's animatronics creation of Chucky has advanced a little more with refined detail and zeal developments. The face and body movements seem a bit more flexible.Who gave this doll life was the ultra-cool and memorably wicked vocal performance of Brad Dourif as Chucky. It became Dourif's definite trademark role. Alex Vincent returns and isn't particularly that convincing in a stiff performance as Andy. Gladly it doesn't do any damage, but only enhances the traumatic angle they are going for. Having the same person playing the role added some continuity though. Adding a professional touch to this b-grade fluff were the likes of the always elegantly classy Jenny Agutter and ripely formal Gerrit Graham were likable as the foster parents Joanne and Phil Simpson. Christine Elise is fittingly strong as the delinquent teen Kyle. Also there are minor, but decent performances by Grace Zabriskie, Beth Grant and Greg Germann.The novelty isn't a complete waste, but if you take the unbelievably illogical premise and the unpleasant nature with a grain of salt. There's sure entertainment amongst this nonsense that doesn't pretend to be anything else.",Child's Play 2

Imagine Rosemary's Baby or Psycho with a load of follow up films with 2, 3 and such after them, and you get the idea of how things worked out. But, while an original film may have become much loved for it's original quirks, the sequel (and any that inexplicably followed) were invariably more soulless, tacky, cheap affairs that left a bitter taste in the mouth, and a pining for the original, which is certainly the case with this stinker. With the flimsiest excuse for a plot, Chucky returns to haunt his young charge, who's now been placed in foster care. But none of it is remotely scary, suspenseful or worthy, and what on earth Jenny 'The Railway Children' Agutter is doing in the credited cast list is beyond me.

The main problem is that it's just mostly Chucky trying to transfer his soul into Andy. There are just so many dumb things in this movie. There's a scene where the police stop a woman driving Chucky somewhere and it's completely pointless. This is followed by a scene where Chucky is thrown out of the car. It's pointless too.In one scene, Chucky kills a teacher and it's literally never referenced again for the rest of the entire film. Apparently, no one's suspicious of a dead teacher. I guess the kid playing Andy isn't that bad and it does get pretty creative toward the end. In one scene, the girl Kyle is on a swing and accidentally digs up the other Good Guy doll Chucky buried. Why did he bury the doll under the swing where it could be dug up? It actually does progress the story a little bit, but it's mostly forgettable. **",Child's Play 2
30,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Sorry Jack, Chucky's back!",7,2 April 1999,"Universal must have realized the potential this franchise had and quickly snapped up the rights from MGM after the first movie came out. Writer Don Mancini also must have figured out that his creation of a foul-mouthed killer doll was too good for just one film. The Chucky series would seriously evolve and change over the years but even in this first sequel things are already looking quite different, even if it suffers from Deja Vu a little bit.Now that the cat is out of the bag and we know that Chucky really is alive and it isn't just Andy's imagination, our killer doll gets much more screen time and his wicked personality has more time to develop. The animatronics have improved and a lot of Chucky's character comes through in his wild facial expressions.Director John Lafia shoots the film with a bright, playroom color pallet with most of the location footage done in Los Angeles with only a few key shots done in Chicago (as if the Windy City was ever this sunny). Despite the autumn setting it does feel like a rather Xmas-y film. He's also fully aware of how silly the killer doll concept is and seizes the opportunity for some of the self-aware sarcastic humor seen in the later films. Graeme Revell usually does the most generic horror scores, especially in recent years, but surprisingly he gives Child's Play 2 the best score of the series with a full orchestra at his disposal, he doesn't hold back on the action cues and even delivers a couple of pretty good themes. So much better than the rotten score to the first film and probably one of the best horror scores of the 90s, or even of all time. It really is that good, and elevates this sequel to a higher level than most snobby critics would consider it deserves.There isn't much of a story to Child's Play 2 however. It's just the same as the first, with Chucky going after Andy, who is now staying with a foster family, once more. The body count is higher and there are some good kills, but I wish that the running time wasn't so anorexic and that it held back on the ""lurking in the dark"" scenes.The slick quality and silly nature of Child's Play 2 is probably what prompted Universal to stick with the franchise for good and 23 years later the Chucky films are still coming out.

33,paulclaassen,A Classic in its own right!,6,2 September 2020,"With very little experience as director, John Lafia took over the reigns as director on 'Child's Play 2', and he didn't disappoint.While the original 'Child's Play' is an absolute classic, I'm still deciding whether 'Child's Play 2' is actually better, which is rare for a sequel. I just loved everything about this film. 'Child's Play 2' follows directly on 'Child's Play', and Alex Vincent is back as Andy. Brad Douriff is also back as the voice of Chucky (lets face it, Chucky just wouldn't be Chucky without Brad Douriff!!).Chucky is creepy as ever, and the personification of true evil. By now we already know what to expect from Chucky, and its frightening. He will stop at nothing to transfer his soul to Andy, the first person he revealed his true identity to. And although he doesn't want to, his options are limited and he is not in the least overjoyed at the prospect of being a kid again.We've seen our fare share of doll movies over the years, but Chucky is still by far the best - and most disturbing - doll creation ever (in my opinion). 'Child's Play 2' features very good acting, compelling characters, good photography, and great prosthetics. I really enjoyed Kyle (Christine Elise), who is a strong, independent character.The film builds to a roller coaster ride finale - even more heart pounding than the climax in the original film.

35,johnnyboyz,"If it's any good at all then it's good for the first hour or so, after which illogical actions and mindless chase kicks in.",5,8 September 2008,"Child's Play 2, like so many other films in its respective 'slasher' sub-genre, begs the question at probably around about the hour mark, by which time we'll have seen a couple of grizzly ends, 'are we still scared by something that's been happening for the last sixty minutes?' Sure, cheap thrills and the odd manifested jump are good fun but after a while a few of these do wear you down and the film feels like a procession. Child's Play 2 is one of these films that is good for what it is but the ambiguity surrounding the young hero's mental state and the consistent feeling you have that a character is about to get eliminated makes you weary.The returning hero is Andy Barclay (Vincent) and whilst he won't need quite as much child counselling as Rachel Carruthers' little sister in Halloween 4, it's probably still recommended. But Andy's suffering is escalated in this film, nicely put across in the film's opening. Andy is adopted by some foster parents that put across an uncomfortable feeling for the audience to endure, mostly down to the fact the father isn't sure on whether he wants a foster-child in the first place and Andy's time at school is difficult with particular attention paid to bullies and strict teachers.But while the parents that are Phil (Graham) and Joanne (Agutter) come across as quite useless, Andy's one mentor that it seems can keep him safe or is at least on his level is his new foster-sister, Kyle (Elsie). Combining the protagonist's sister of sorts as a motherly figure is a brave move for the film to take  it echoes the work psychoanalytic theorists might undertake when studying a disturbed child's psychosis and whom a really young child may latch onto when seeking a motherly figure of sorts. In this case, Andy fits the bill as the disturbed child and perhaps the equally disturbed Kyle slots into place as the young but old enough for Andy's sake motherly figure whom must protect him and help him through any obstacles.Although Child's Play 2 remains nothing spectacular. The film is really a series of events that place the child in a string of unnerving and unpleasant situations. The main source for suspense lies in the manner of which Andy tries to convince those around him, haplessly, that he is innocent of doing certain things like breaking a family ornament, and that Chucky is the reason. We know it wasn't Andy but his superiors have no reason to suspect otherwise thus rendering the scenes effective in their own right but somewhat disturbing from the audience's point of view  this is largely down to how we react to seeing very young children being put in vulnerable positions and made to look incorrect.But this segment of the film has this and only this going for it. There is a bit of suspense and some nicely timed comic touches when another, less animated, Chucky doll is around and the evil Chucky must remember what his name was upon taking identity. Then there is the scene in which Kyle finds the doll buried in the garden and the penny drops. The trouble is, we, or at least I, wouldn't have cared if Chucky had won these battles. If we look at the possible knife fodder in the opening exchanges, they consist of Andy (who we don't want to be harmed); Kyle (who we progressively don't want harmed); the foster parents (who we don't really mind seeing harmed), Andy's teacher (who we wouldn't mind seeing harmed) and some of the meaner kids at the school. Trouble is, if Chucky kills some of these characters as you're watching the film it wouldn't be all that bad because of the manner in which they're put across initially. This results in us siding with the villain which can be fun at times in other films perhaps but not here.So if the film is at its most effective during these exchanges in the first hour, then what follows surely relegates the film to the level of failure. After certain events transpire and it turns out Kyle and Andy must leave the house, the film falls apart. It turns into a brainless chase/slasher with disturbed logic and references to other, much better past horror films: notice the chase in the maze of factory boxes at the end being very akin to the The Shining finale and the scene from Psycho in which a female slowly turns around the character of the mother who's sitting in a chair with a face you don't want to see. Questions are raised, not least when Kyle runs Chucky over in the car and then gets out to check if she got him; sure enough, he jumps on her back and attacks. Then there is the shot at the factory of the 'release valve' sign, which is the most blatant set up for future events to happen I've ever seen in a film.Child's Play 2 is not ashamed of being paint by numbers for its final act. There is the fatal blow, the twist of fate, the false conclusion and then the film tiptoes around the new order completely, meaning we have to pencil in what happens next. The conflict is there and the film gets across a desperate atmosphere of lust for survival but somewhere along the lines it felt like the brains behind the operation went walkabout.",Child's Play 2

Andy's mom lands in an institution cos nobody believes her story cos the cops backed out.
Chucky follows Andy who is now in a foster home.

41,insomniac_rod,Chucky lost respect.,5,9 August 2004,"""Child's Play"" (1988) surprised horror fans worldwide because it wasn't as cheesy as thought. In fact, it's a great horror movie with an interesting premise, good direction, great acting, and some scary moments. I wish I could say the same about the direct 1990 sequel ""Child's Play 2"". Obviously this sequel was very rushed and came when it shouldn't. Spending more time on a script and another choice for director could've helped this to become a decent sequel. **SPOILERS** After the traumatic events of part 1, Andy Barclay is separated from his mother and both are under psychological treatment. Then Andy is settled with an adoptive family formed by Mr. and Mrs. Simpson and Kyle, an orphan troubled girl also adopted by the Simpsons. Police denied Andy and his mother's version of the events and close the case making the events of the original movie as non existent. Executives and the President of the ""Good Guy"" company needed an official explanation in order to shut down rumors spread by tabloids about a possessed Good Guy doll. Engineers of the company explore and repair the rests of the supposedly possessed doll and do not find any abnormality. Suddenly lightning strikes the doll and one of the producing engineers gets electrocuted and dies. Chucky is resurrected that way and once again starts his search for Andy in order to get his soul out of the body and pass it on Andy's.Chucky manages to enter Andy's new house and subsequently his life. Nobody believes Andy when he says that Chucky is alive and living inside the house, but when things start to get a little ugly after Mr. Simpson's death, only Kyle realizes the boy is telling the truth. Kyle and Chucky escape from Chucky after a series of events and persecutions and end up in the Good Guy factory. The climatic ending leads Andy and Kyle blowing up Chucky's body (or what it's left of it). You have to watch it for specific details, it's a very weird death.This time Chucky kills Andy's school teacher, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, a Good Guy exec., a Good Guy worker, Tommy (a Good Guy doll), and a woman of the family center. ACTING. In this field the best is Alex Vincent's performance. He's a very cute boy still and this time his performance is stronger than in the first movie. He had potential to become a child star. Kyle's performance is okay, and her beautiness helps a lot. Brad Dourif's voice is still excellent and gives Chucky a personality. The other actors are regular and makes us miss Mr. Sarandon and Catherine Hicks. DIRECTION. Boring and tries to copy Tom Holland's. This movie is not attractive for the eye and is just one of the bunch of early 90's crappy horror movies. F/X. Chucky has more screen time but sadly it's not as good as in part 1. Remember, quantity is not quality. The gore is okay and Chucky's death is somewhat good in the gore field. SCORE. Regular. Nothing you haven't seen.Watch ""Child's Play"" 2 only if you are a big fan of Chucky. I'm not a huge fan but I enjoy his movies; I'm a big fan of the original Child's Play movie, not because of Chucky. As a child I like all of the Chucky movies the same, but not that I can say I enjoy good horror I realize the best of the bunch is ""Child's Play"". Sequels shouldn't be spawned after the original IMO. After the superior ""Child's Play"", the franchise turned into horror/comedy movies with a Chucky that would crack one liners a la Freddy Krueger. By the time of part 2, Chucky wasn't nearly scary or menacing as in the original.4/10. Mindless fun.",Child's Play 2
42,Anonymous_Maxine,"Not much more than a continuation, but still a worthy sequel.",7,2 December 2004,"I think I liked Child's Play 2 more than most people, given the reviews that I've read and the movie's low voter rating on the IMDb. A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray, notorious serial killer, again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities. By now, Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll, because as we were informed in the first film, if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever. Needless to say, Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6-year-old (and who wouldn't?) rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll.Although, given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body, how human will he eventually become? Will he ever reach full human-hood? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life, where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there, kind of like computer generated actors. There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies, and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human. He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there.At any rate, Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family. When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house, his foster father grabs him and says, 'Rule #1, no running in the house!' OK, 'dad,' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul? My God, man, what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter.There are some funny moments in the film, such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll, buries it, and takes its place in the house, and my favorite, when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult, Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice, 'Hi! I'm.Tommy!'The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale. In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll, they have decided to reintroduce it into the market. The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toy-makers, who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it, it was not really a demon-possessed toy, so they decided to melt it down and remake it. Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure, but who cares. Waste not, want not, I guess.At any rate, Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body (too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another), and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul. I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something, but you'll remember in the first movie, the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll.Jarrett Friend, writing for HorrorWatch, made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation, but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls, since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie. This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality; my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big.Nevertheless, even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story, Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels, kind of like Psycho II, which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence. I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2, but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting, if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape. There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film, not including, however, the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost, making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so. A bit trite, but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film, which is the final scene, one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie. Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene. I do, however, think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got. I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits.

Perhaps it's because we, as an audience, are more comfortable with the concept of a killer doll with foul language, and a little boy who is a gutsy unwilling victim. Also, while the first one was campy, the second has some seriously funny moments. However, the camp is still quite prevalent.But, as the human soul is indestructible, so is Chucky. It's the soul of Charles Lee Ray, which animates him, after all, and until they figure out how to destroy a soul, we're going to be ""blessed"" with Chucky movies.7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Child's Play 2

Everything about this movie is so boring and deaths scene could not even save the movie, I would say this is the Worst Child's play movie in the series, I would say fast forward to last 7 minutes of the movie, as it the only worth watching part of movie, to see chucky getting killed off yet again.",Child's Play 2
46,GiraffeDoor,Sort of half way between horror comedy and dark comedy. Hits the spot just right.,8,10 November 2019,"As someone who feels the first one has not aged well, this was a swell flick.A horror sequel gets to play by slightly different rules to the conventional horror. We all know who the bad guy is and what he is. Instead of the slow burn we get a bloody good show down of good versus evil in the form of an adorable little boy against the possessed toy we so adore to hate. OK, I know Chucky is a sociopathic killer but tell me you don't sometimes wish you convey the same badassdom he does? And he wears frickin' suspenders.A good sequel needs to either answer the questions raised by the first, in this case the aftermath of someone under attack by a menace no one believe if you told them. And no one does believe them. It's like that Twilight episode with the gremlin: even though you know what the threat is, seeing this amazingly stolid kid try to tell the truth and not get believed by the people whose job it is to protect him, hits a raw nerve. The foster dad almost crashes his car, they let THESE people foster kids but won't let someone certain other people? That's another angle this movie has: how a child being ""taken into care"" does not mean they mean to take care of the child.An obvious advantage over the first one is that we get more Chucky, still voiced deliciously by the amazing Brad Dourif. The animatronics for Chucky are superb, not only does he command all the evils of the uncanny valley, the emotion and expression the puppet can convey makes for fascinating.The whole thing has a few laugh at loud moments (if you find messed up stuff funny and if you don't, why on earth are you watching this movie?), along with just the right pinches of pathos, action, suspense and story telling.I think I'll watch again one day. I don't want to say it's the movie the first one should have been because like I've said it is very much the impeccable sequel experience, but it really shows how good a horror sequel can be.",Child's Play 2

A ridiculously underrated action packed sequel.
This fun Sequel has a fantastic opening sequence with a great music score, in fact that's one of this films strong points is it's Excellent full orchestra score that gives the movie a real shot of Class & Richness.
This is a very visually pleasing film too with colourful production & Cinematography that's almost comic-book style sometimes & adds to the dark child like fantasy & Creepy happenings.I have huge Nostalgia love for ""Child's play 2"" as i can still vividly remember seeing the Cool poster for it in the front window of my local video store way back in when it first came out to rent!!! That black poster with the colourful & angry looking Chucky holding a big pair of scissors about to cut the head off of the scared Jack-in-a-box, a great vivid image right there & one that's never left me just like my great memories of my favourite movie of all time ""Ghostbusters 2"" as i grew up watching & loving these types of films.I also grew up watching the first Child's play film too on video & it's still the best of the franchise of course.
Child's play 2 is an exciting & thrilling movie & a decent sequel with Child's play 2 everything is more adventurous & outrageous & just more playful in away but not as Creepy of as good as the original one.
The cast is great fun & the killing scenes are
memorable like the Teacher scene at the school & the Awesome showdown at the big Toy factory at night & Chucky is more fun & violent this time & actually hilarious at times with that dark humour, the action is great & the music is fun & the look & cinematography is great with cool slick colourful 90's look.
This time little killer Chucky follows ""Andy"" to a new Foster home & starts his slicing & tormenting from there & the best ""Human"" star of this film goes to Christine Elise as ""Kyle"" the rebellious angry teen of the film & it's a fun & well acted part & she's a cool character & hero!!!
The production is slick & Cool & the killings are creative & gory & Chucky is great & the best ever been on screen!!!
The whole end battle/Showdown in the Toy factory is a fantastic & excitingly intense & thrilling sequence & the most memorable ""Chucky"" moments here as he becomes a melted mutant killing machine & it's Awesome.
Child's play 2 is a darker & more wickedly fun, wild ride & a colourful nightmare but is still missing some key characters & performances, with the likes of the excellent Katherine Hicks & Chris Sarandon, these two characters are what made the first Child's Play so damn great as these two gave excellent performances & raised the Killer Doll Slasher to a higher level of Quality. As much as i like this solid sequel it's no match for the brilliance of the first film.I have alot of Nostalgic love for both Child's Play & it's fun Sequel as they came around at a time when i was young & noticing films more & more & starting to like certain stuff for example i loved both Ghostbusters films & both Gremlins & both Predator films & both Robocop films & Marked For Death & Out for Justice & Cyborg & The 'Burbs & A.W.O.L & Kindergarten Cop & The Running Man & Total Recall & both Terminators & Maniac Cop & Home Alone 1&2 & Batman & Batman Returns & more, seems the films from around the late 80's to early 90's had the biggest impact on me & my movie tastes so those films i hold close to my movie loving heart.",Child's Play 2

The humour is much darker in this one. Dourif... once again, he is the highlight of the film and the entire series so far. Vincent is good as well. Although many people, who seen the film didn't really liked the subplot involving Andy's foster parents. The best parts of the movie are scenes involving Chucky and the especially the conclusion in the Doll Factory makes this movie worth seeing.

51,truemythmedia,They Get Better...,3,18 October 2019,"The original ""Child's Play"" is not a great film, but I laughed so much that I knew I would eventually wind up seeing some of the sequels. The overall concept of a killer doll could potentially be slightly terrifying, and the first film certainly had a few moments where there was actual tension (like when Chris Sarandon's car is hijacked by Chucky). The first film had some creativity, and someone actually tried when they put that movie together; again, it's not great, but there are some moments that truly were a lot of fun.""Child's Play 2"" is everything that is wrong with the horror genre and its tendency to provide an abundance of schlocky and pointless sequels. There is quite literally no reason for this movie to exist; I don't even thing the writers of this film knew why they were making it. The plot (if you can call it that) is rush and nonsensical; the stuff Chucky does is both less threatening and less entertaining than what he did in the original ""Child's Play""; and worst of all, it's abundantly clear that this film was made just to cash in on the success of the original, and in doing so it completely negates the ending of the original. This film should've been aborted before it ever made it to a term in cinemas, but it wasn't and everyone who sees it suffers the consequences for it being allowed to live; those consequences being mostly boredom.",Child's Play 2

At the beginning, the film is okay, but before long, it becomes unlikable, and come the climax it is practically unwatchable. The original Child's Play was constructed like Jaws, the monster (or monster doll in this case) was kept in the shadows until the last half hour, which was good filmaking on the part of both directors. In Jaws 2, having seen what the shark is and what it was capable of, the filmmakers figured there is no need to hide it anymore, and the makers of Child's Play two are doing the same thing with Chucky, big mistake. The tension is reduced to a handful of boo moments, Chucky is no longer scary, he is loud and obnoxious, and the climax offers impressively amusing and money efficient set design in an other wise wreck of a concluding chapter. This is arguably one of the worst horror sequels I have seen in the last few years, save your money. This doll should be left in the box.",Child's Play 2
53,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Close to being as good as the first,7,10 January 2014,"After the success of the Child's Play (1988), writer and creator Don Mancini knew that a sequel would be on its way. And of course, the smart thing to do would be to continue the story from the first movie. And for the most part, the sequel stays faithful to the story line. It does have a few areas that need to be addressed but all around it pretty much matches its parent. After the torturous event of Charles Lee Ray (The Lakeshore Strangler) attacking the Barclay home, it was time to move on. Sadly things didn't get better for Andy Barclay. Andy's mother is sent to a psych ward for help and Andy is put into a foster home. Making matters worse, is the Good Guy Doll company somehow acquired the burnt dismembered parts of Chucky and decided to clean him off and put him back together. Unbeknownst to them, once re-assembled, Chucky comes back to life and begins his rampage of violence to find Andy again. And that's all there is to this. It is just another set up to have Chucky (voice by Brad Dourif) killing people to get to the boy that he told his secret to. Is it bad? No, it actually can hold its own as a good sequel.The weakest area is Mr. Mancini's writing. For example, very few audiences are familiar with voodoo and it's never explained to why Chucky came back to life after being re-assembled. Was that apart of the voodoo spell? Besides, in the first movie, wasn't it shooting Chucky in the heart the only way to kill him? That's a big loophole. However, it's also forgivable because a lot of people like Chucky, so it's obvious a lot of people will not care too much. It's crazy though how similar this sequel is like Hellraiser II: Hellbound (1988). The director of Hellbound was a crewmember for Hellraiser (1987) and then directed the sequel. Same goes for John Lafia, the director of this film. He too was apart of Child's Play (1988) and then went on to direct the sequel to this franchise. And both sequels are decent and have good continuity but suffer from weak reasoning for the logic behind the continuity. A very similar parallel that is interesting to think about.As for actors, it's obvious that Brad Dourif is needed to play Chucky and his performance is always the best. Next is Alex Vincent whom fans should be happy to see because he's a key part of why Chucky exists and his performance is just as likable as he was from the first movie. Lastly is Christine Elise who plays another foster child named Kyle who befriends Andy. At a point she develops a strong will to fight and it's good that she wasn't written in as a scream and do nothing girl. But as for the rest of the cast, they aren't much to talk about. The foster parents and every other individual are the same. They don't believe a killer doll exists (and right fully so, IF this were a reality). Oh well, their loss.The last couple of elements that viewers should enjoy is the cinematography by Stefan Czapsky and music. Unlike the first movie, which contained grittier and darker colors, this movie has brighter more elementary colors, which give something new for fans to look at. Plus, the music produced by upcoming composer at the time, Graeme Revell, did a much better job than the score from the first movie by Joe Renzetti. Here Revell actually uses an orchestra and not just synths. And, Revell even gives the Child's Play franchise a motif theme and some creepy tunes. A well developed horror score. Does it top its predecessor - no. Is it a good sequel - yes.Like other horror sequels, it lacks clarification on logic but it still amounts to a decent sequel. The score has improved as well allowing to sound more like a horror film.",Child's Play 2
54,PredragReviews,"""Sorry Jack... Chucky's Back!""",7,18 June 2016,"There isn't much of a story to ""Child's Play 2"" however. It's just the same as the first, with Chucky going after Andy, who is now staying with a foster family, once more. The body count is higher and there are some good kills. I've heard people complain about the 'silly' spanking death of the schoolteacher. Well, this ain't true. Chucky is actually hacking at her. If you look closely you'll see the blood all over the yardstick.Director John Lafia shoots the film with a bright, playroom color pallet with a higher quality film stock, giving it a more sophisticated sparkle. He's also fully aware of how silly the killer doll concept is and seizes the opportunity for a little bit of that self-aware, sometimes sarcastic humor seen in the later films. Graeme Revell usually does the most generic horror scores, especially in recent years, but surprisingly he gives Child's Play 2 the best score of the series. With a full orchestra at his disposal, he doesn't hold back on the action cues and even delivers a couple of pretty good themes. So much better than the rotten score to the first film and probably one of the best horror scores of the early 90's.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Child's Play 2
55,gangstahippie,Pretty entertaining and starts becoming funny,8,9 March 2008,Rated R for Violence and Language I have seen all the Chucky films except for Bride Of Chucky.This film is a continuation of the first film.Andy is now older and with a foster family but Chucky has followed him and tries to kill him so he can take over his body.The only person who later believes and helps him is the other foster child.I haven't seen this one in a while but I remember there being one funny scene in the film.I find this is foreshadowing for the series becoming a horror/comedy.Its not as good as the first Child's Play or Seed Of Chucky but its worth a look if you saw the first one.Its better than Child's Play 3.,Child's Play 2
56,vengeance20,Slight improvement over Child's Play (1989),8,1 August 2018,"So after 2 years we get Child's Play 2 which continues on the story of Chucky/Charles Lee Ray with his quest on trying to transform his soul into Andy's body! So after the events of Child's Play, Andy gets sent to a foster home (& later gets adopted by foster parents) while his mum Karen gets sent to a mental Asylum, while police however deny everything though the Play Pals toy company refurbishes the charred remains of Chucky, but all hell breaks lose & once again Chucky is hot on Andy's trail!I found this sequel to be better than the original slightly. I mean the deaths scenes where more creative & unique in this entry than in the previous. Making this sequel better then the first. I also found the story-line to be more interesting as well as the climax at the end in the factory, which was amazing! The blood effects & violence were there & kicked arse!The characters in this film had more depth in them too, & seemed to be a little more interesting.Overall slightly better than the first! 8/10",Child's Play 2
57,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Oddly artistic, ""Child's Play 2"" has an almost grandiose, mythical feel to it's tone and style. Though it doesn't quite hit home with the same quality as the original.",6,13 September 2014,"There's something to marvel at while watching ""Child's Play 2."" From a grandiose score courtesy of the wonderful Graeme Revell. To some really fascinating set-design. To quirky, stylized direction from John Lafia. And even a few key scenes that have a timeless, mythical feel. It seems that the creative team behind ""Child's Play 2"" sought to not only create an effective sequel, but also build the character of Chucky into the sort of thing that legends are made of. This is a big, bombastic, wild ride of a film, constrained within the guise of being a standard slasher-sequel.But, there's something important to think about. A key question. Does it work?And the answer to that question: Sort of, I guess.Following a wild opening in which Chucky (voiced by the fantastic Brad Dourif) is re-constructed in a way that I actually found quite intriguing, he escapes and sets off to find his old target- young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), who is in the process of being placed into a new foster home. With his new body, Chucky hopes to finally be able to transfer his tormented spirit into a human host once and for all. And so a sort-of deadly game begins, as Chucky infiltrates Andy's new home, and toys with him, causing him distress and picking off the people around him, leading up to a final confrontation that I can only describe as epic in scope and quite satisfying.Returning screenwriter Don Mancini seems more at home this time around (after some apparent drama with the first film going into rewrites), and relishes in the chaos of the storyline. You can feel a writer just having fun with the material when you watch this film. Everything is bigger. Stakes rise to new heights. Set-pieces are more encompassing and wild. And there are new ideas being explored left and right.John Lafia's guidance as director is quite good. While the original film was slick and grounded, Lafia here goes for stylized visuals that lend a unique quality to the film, making it feel more akin to a fairy-tale. And I really enjoyed that aspect of the production. Although at times it does take you out of the movie, because things are a little TOO stylish. (A scene where a character has to run around a maze of boxes, while suspenseful, will probably make you chuckle and exclaim ""Who stacks boxes like that?!"")I found the performances admirable. Alex Vincent grows quite a bit as a young performer. Though I didn't mention it in my review of the first film, I never found his acting organic or believable. He was just a little too young and a little too cute for you to believe the emotions he was trying to convey. But here, he knocks it out of the park. He's a bit older, as had more experience acting, and is able to give a really remarkable, compelling performance for a child-actor. Supporting roles by the likes of Christine Elise and Jenny Agutter are also quite good. Particularly Elise as ""Kyle"", Andy's older ""Foster Sister"", who becomes the person he connects with most in the story. She has a lot of heart in her performance, and comes off well on- screen, and along with Andy, is the one person you really care for.And of course there is Brad Dourif. He IS Chucky. His role is a perfect blend of different elements, combining to create a near-ideal slasher-movie villain. Dourif's voice is commanding and threatening, yet also oddly endearing and amusing when it needs to be. His delivery is spot-on in every scene. And he is able to take charge of every scene he's in.All of this being said, I do think there are a lot of fundamental issues with the film. And I do believe that despite rampant strengths, it just doesn't quite ""gel together"" as it did in the first movie.Despite the more grandiose scale and qualities of the film, I thought it didn't do quite as good a job at forging human connections. With so much chaotic content, the smaller moments just seemed to become lost in translation, which is a pretty big issue. This is a film of style over substance.I also felt that the film lost me at a few times. Some of the performers aren't up to snuff (despite the main cast being great), some of the deaths are bizarre and weak, and some moments just seemed silly, or went on for far too long.If the film could have gone through just a little bit more trimming and re-editing, I think it could easily have matched the quality of the original.But still, as it stands, ""Child's Play 2"" is highly enjoyable, albeit flawed. And I think that in the grand scheme of things, it's definitely worth checking out for all fans of horror. If the story doesn't win you over, the crazy, mythical style just might.I give it an average 6 out of 10.",Child's Play 2
58,punishmentpark,A decent follow-up.,7,23 November 2015,"This follow-up to the somewhat legendary cult film 'Child's play' still works pretty good as well. The story moves on where the last one ended, but unfortunately Catherine Hicks is no longer in the picture. Instead, there is a foster family with the best of intentions, but also a lot of doubts, who take poor Andy in. But Chucky is coming...soon!Christine Elise may be a sort of substitute for Hicks' part, being another (teen) child being taken in by the family. Chucky chases the children up and down the city again, and some horror scenes are pretty cool, with a fun finale in the toy factory.Good fun was had by all, once again. 7 out of 10.",Child's Play 2

60,gedikreverdi,It was such a fun sequel,7,8 June 2021,It was extremely fun to watch. Andy started to live with his foster parents because his mother along with the police from the first installment were hospitalized. He was living with his new parents and another teen girl Kyle who's also a foster child. They manually repaired the charred Chucky and Chucky used a police officer to arrive where Andy was living and smothered the officer in his car seat. He buried the tommy doll under the swing in the backyard and become the tommy doll of the house. He killed the teacher of Andy while Andy is in detention because chichi wrote some obscenity on Andy's paper. Then He killed the father of the house in the basement by breaking his neck and the foster mother wanted Andy to leave and he was taken to the adoption center. Kyle dumped Chucky in the trash can and started swinging in the backyard and unburied the doll. She went up and saw the foster mother dead in front of her sewing machine which is still working. Chucky with a knife forced her to drive to the center. With fire alarm on the kids were evacuated and the manager took Kyle with the doll in her arms and Andy to her office and Chucky killed her too. The three then ended up in the tommy doll factory and Chucky killed the night shifter too and placed him on the conveyor and his eyes was poked with doll eyes. Then Chucky's hand got ripped and he replaced it with a knife. And Eventually Andy turned him into a lump of plastic by pouring hot molten plastic on him and exploded his head with an air pipe in his mouth. The kill count was extremely high and I really enjoyed it. I would like to see Kyle in the third installment too.,Child's Play 2
61,DunnDeeDaGreat,Although different from the first film it's an okay sequel,6,20 April 2002,"Child's Play 2 is very different from the first film. It introduces us to comedic Chucky, why is it that every good horror villian has to be a comedian ? The film does have good effects and one-liners though. Check it out if you want a good laugh.",Child's Play 2
62,IonicBreezeMachine,"It suffers from many of the same problems most horror sequels have, but the acting, craft, and dark humor make it worthwhile.",6,18 October 2021,"Following the events of the first film, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) has been placed in foster care after his mother Karen has been committed to a psychiatric hospital and the police deny everything related to the events. Andy is placed in the care of foster parents Joanne and Phil Simpson (Jenny Agutter and Gerrit Graham respectively) who also have teenage foster daughter, Kyle (Christine Elise). Unbeknownst to Andy, Play Pals Toyz, manufacturer of the Good Guys dolls has acquired the Chucky doll and reassembled it to test for faults to mitigate fears by the shareholders and possible legal liability. The reconstruction of the doll brings back Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) who sets out to try and swap souls with Andy before his doll form becomes ""too human"" and he's trapped in it forever.With the success of the first Child's Play movie, a sequel began preproduction much like how United Artists intended. When MGM/UA was in the midst of a potential acquisition however, production was ordered to halt due to a ban by purchaser, Christopher Skase, on producing horror films. The project was put into turnaround with many companies interested in the property with Universal eventually securing the rights after Steven Spielberg advocated on producer David Kirschner's behalf. Directing duties this time around go to John Lafia, a co-writer on the first film, with series creator Don Mancini returning. Child's Play 2 isn't as well balanced with its mixture of horror and dark humor, and the plot requires characters to procrastinate or be oblivious to the glaringly obvious, but it is well acted, stylishly directed, delivers on the fun.As with the last movie, Brad Dourif is a lot of fun playing the foul mouthed and sadistic My Buddy doll from Hell that we all know and love. The effects work to bring the doll to life have been vastly improved from the already impressive first film and the filmmakers get really creative especially in the third act with Chucky's mixture of rubber, plastic, and flesh. Alex Vincent returns as Andy Barclay and is much more confident in his performance this time around in comparison to the solid but inconsistent delivery in the first film. I also really enjoyed Christine Elise as Andy's foster sister Kyle who at first seems like a head strong rebel filled with anger and resentment but doesn't convey that in her actions where she becomes something of a mentor figure to Andy and one of the only persons in the film willing to listen to him. It's no wonder why this character resonated with the fanbase because it's well conceived and brought to life by Elise's strong performance.The movie certainly delivers on kill scenes, character moments, and especially its visuals with the Simpson's home, Andy's school, and especially the Good Guys factory/warehouse where much of the climax takes place all look visually striking and distinguished. All the scenes of Chucky bumping people off are impactful and darkly comic but I do have to note two things. 1) Child's Play 2 is never scary, it's a very bright colorful movie where it's traded the dark urban Chicago setting of the first film for the quietness of Suburbia and while the suburbs can and have been used to good effect in horror, the framing and direction seems to be focused more on emphasizing the visual appeal rather than anything unsettling. 2) Chucky's plan doesn't make all that much sense. Chucky needs to get Andy alone so he can do the ritual and put his soul in Andy's body but the steps he takes such as bashing in the head of another Good Guy doll named Tommy, defacing Andy's homework with profanity, or doing other things that don't seem to help Chucky achieve his goal leaves the movie feel like it's puttering around in circles to meet it's 80 minute runtime.Child's Play 2 improves upon the effects work and acting of the first film while being somewhat more mixed in its story and mixture of horror and dark humor. Alex Vincent and Christine Elise do well as our leads, Brad Dourif is just as good here as he was in the original, and the direction by John Lafia is visually striking showing off the team's great effects work. But the movie doesn't have the same urgency that drove the first one and its story feels like a series of cul-de-sacs until we get to the last third. If you enjoyed Child's Play you'll get what you expect from Child's Play 2.",Child's Play 2
63,Fernando-Rodrigues,Batteries Not Included,5,4 February 2021,"It's kinda cheesy but it screams '90's energy. And why the h they used Chucky's ""dead body"" to recreate the Good Guy doll? Nonsense.",Child's Play 2
64,ODDBear,Pretty thin,5,31 March 2009,"Well, there was no way this could have worked with any real degree of success.Although, I must admit, the set-up is quite good and the final act is well done. Everything in between; young Andy in a very strange halfway house with rather idiotic adult characters (and the requisite good-bad teenage girl) is pretty tiresome. Lame kills, mediocre Chucky one-liners and zero suspense (and surprisingly; no gore).But things really pick up for the finale, inside a toy factory, and suddenly suspense and inventive kills start popping up.All in all ""Child's Play 2"" is average entertainment for a horror buff.",Child's Play 2
65,fmarkland32,Somebody think of the children...,7,6 September 2006,"This time Chucky goes after the boy who destroyed him before, see this time the Chuckster is on a time limit to possess Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent, far better this time) before he remains a doll forever. Child's Play 2 isn't scary, but it does have moments of such cynicism towards adults and it is all done through a child's view. Indeed Chucky is more of a vigilante rather than a monster. The most striking thing about Child's Play 2 is how Twin Peakish it starts out once it moves past the doll factory. Alex Vincent is being adopted in a suburban area so normal it sets the perfect mood for a horror movie. Also there is an attitude that regards children in this movie that is just as cynical, the adults never believe our child hero, force him to conform to their rules and basically never give him any credit. These adults are throughly unlikable and clearly deserve their medicine which ""The Chuckster"" delivers by the spoonful. The teacher in particular is a cold hearted and viscous type that make a student feel stupid or make a child feel worthless. So watching Chucky dispatch her becomes quite perverse pleasure. Also of note is the adults who cheat on their wives, live in a museum of a house and basically in general care more about appearances than actually being parents. One is never convinced that the step-parents ever adopt Alex Vincent out of love but rather for appearances sake. In fact when Chucky takes apart the family unit, it speaks volumes that he destroys one of their priceless artifacts to add insult to injury. Even better is when Chucky chases the duo in the climax, where he takes on an imposing edge not seen in the series. As many have noted Chucky comes off as an adult figure and it is clearly these scenes that make this the best of the series. A fascinating effort to be sure.* * * out of 4-(Good)",Child's Play 2
66,educallejero,A sequel that improves the original,6,18 September 2018,"With the lead characters already presented, the sequel had the opportunity to give more room for the super funny Brad Dourif voiced Chucky, making the sequel not just a horror movie, but also a dark comedy of sorts. And it's all better for it.The Chucky scenes are as good, but the setting even better. In this one, the poor Andy doesn't even have his mother for support and love! The fragile situation about his foster family makes up a perfect environment for a kid to feel truly alone. We clearly see him totally hopeless. Without the mother, the help to fight against Chucky comes from his foster sister teenager, actually nice and quite mature, far from the usual cliché and hateful characterizations that teens usually receive in horror movies.The acting is just better in this one. Alex Vincent improved his acting, Dourif is as Dourif and Christine Elise was great as the sister, with a good supporting cast.The story is basically a remake of the original, but everything just works better, including the score. Sometimes more is better, like with this sequel.",Child's Play 2
67,ivo-cobra8,Great sequel in my opinion my favorite horror film in the series,9,18 August 2017,"This film is my all time favorite film in the Chucky film franchise and in my opinion it is a great sequel. Is it better than the original of course no but it is definitely my favorite because it has a happy ending better than the first one. I love the two main heroes in this film Alex Vincent and Christine Elise. This film in my opinion was way better than A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors in my opinion. Nightmare 3 is most people favorite film in the Freddy franchise but is not mine and I just don't feel to be my favorite film of all time.This was my first film actually I saw this film in the 90's when I was in the second grade this movie scared the hell out of me. I really believed that my mom's doll will come alive and try to get me like Chucky tried to get Andy and put his soul in it. I love this movie to death I love how they resurrected Chucky back in this film. Just like the film producers resurrected Jason back to live in Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives and I love this slasher film, It is really dark, creepy and scary enough.Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon did not return for this sequel and also Tom Holland did not return to direct this film, but it was directed by John Lafia who also helped to write the script for the first film and I think he did a good job directing it. Alex Vincent and Brad Dourif were the only two actors from the first film who return to reprise their roles to the sequel after this Alex Vincent never returned to play his role in any other sequels. To me he is Tommy Jarvis from Friday the 13th, Corey Feldman never returned to play the next sequels Friday the 13th ever again. So yea I have easily root for Andy and Kyle (Christine Elise), F*** You Chucky the killer doll. We also have Jenny Agutter in this film from An American Werewolf in London and she still looks young even tough that film was filmed 9 years before these film was released. Christine Elise from 21 Jump Street (1987) TV series Season 4 Episode 8 Out of Control is in this film and her only film debut. Grace Zabriskie from Twin Peaks is also in this film so we have two actresses who played before in a horror movie and in the horror TV series that is really a surprise. What I love about this film is Andy and Kyle even tough they weren't real brother and sister they were adopted when but Kyle found out that Chucky the doll is alive and want's Andy dead, she drops everything and rush in to fight with Chucky and to race against time to stop Chuck once and for all. The ending was happy and I like happy endings in the horror films.Why did I say I think this film is better sequel in my opinion then A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors? Because I don't like Patricia Arquette in the film to me her character Kristin Parker was useless! She did not stop Freddy when she was a Dream Warrior but Dr. Neil Gordon stopped him when he sent Freddy back to hell and Nancy Thompson sacrifice her self only to be killed off. She saved Kristen Parker's ass. I think Klye (Christine Elise) from Child's Play 2 would have kicked her ass. I love the last fight in the Good Guy doll factory and I love how they f***** Chucky but that son of a bitch was still kicking around, Andy spilled acid on him and he was still alive I love that. I love the chemistry between Andy and Kyle I love character Andy Barclay to death.The plot is about Andy's mother is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, the young boy is placed in foster care, and Chucky is resurrected and he is back, determined to claim Andy's soul.This movie is fast paced, intense, scary well executed and entertaining well done horror flick from the 90's. I recommend every horror fan to see this film it is well done. It has a good kills and it is also a funny a little. I haven't seen this film in 10 years but I finally re watch it A+ 9/10 my all time favorite Chucky film.

Jenny. Agutter. From The Railway Children, to Logan's Run... to this. You can't get a more varied CV than that.Aside from that anomaly, it's business as usual... with everyone's favourite killer toy getting reassembled again for some obscure reason and embarking on another murder spree. Do not expect high art, plausible human behaviour or the greatest acting ever. Do count on funny/sick moments, a reasonably high death toll and a great climax in a doll factory, which includes a particularly nasty fate for Chucky. About three of them, before he is gone forever. Well, at least until the next sequel.As Woody said in Toy Story, kid's playthings never really die, they just move from owner to owner... bringing joy and laughter to each generation.

69,fernandoschiavi,This sequel has good moments but no longer has the freshness and does not maintain the same tension as the first one,6,9 July 2021,"Unlike franchises like Halloween, there has always been a mentor behind the Child's Play movies: screenwriter Don Mancini, who created and scripted every movie in the series. Even though he hasn't written anything that didn't involve the demonic doll Chucky (with the exception of one episode of Tales from the Crypt), Mancini is a smart screenwriter, who came up with a lot of well-drawn-out situations in every production.Released just two years after the original, this is a sequel that really takes the film's mythology further, explaining the events after the end of the previous film. It starts with a well-crafted scene at the Play Pal toy factory, where a Good Guy doll is being renovated after being set on fire. Guess which doll this is! So it is. After Chucky was destroyed in the previous film, the factory owners think it's a good idea to renovate the doll to combat the bad publicity generated by the murders committed by the toy. Of course, no one believes Chucky will get up and keep killing again. And of course that's exactly what he does. In an inexplicable but even interesting scene, Chucky electrocutes (who knows how and who knows why) one of the employees who were rebuilding him. Meanwhile, the boy Andy (played again by Alex Vincent), a survivor from the previous film, is sent to a foster family after his mother was sent to a clinic for psychological treatment.The problem with the sequel to Toy Assassin is born from the basis on which the film bases its argument. The first film makes it quite clear that, having spent a lot of time in the doll's body, Charles Lee Ray would have no choice but to accept the Good Guy's body as his own, since then the doll would be completely human inside. The second film chooses to ignore this fact, as well as ignore that the doll had already died, rather than continuing a completed story. Once the damage is done, the time has come to move forward and look at the result of all this.Although Alex Vincent remains the interpreter of Andy Barclay, the new cast of actors is not as expressive as that of the original film. With the exception of some good action scenes, Child's Play2 doesn't show anything new compared to the first feature. The sequel just confirms the pattern that would follow in films starring Chucky: it doesn't matter how many times you kill the doll. He comes back. It will always come back. And he will go out and kill everyone he comes across. Director John Lafia, one of the screenwriters of the original, manages to maintain important features of the original, such as the first-person camera in some scenes. The good soundtrack again helps build the suspense, this time performed by Graeme Revell. The big problem is that some good murder scenes are diluted over the course of the projection, which has many more scenes that take place during the day. Chucky's appearances are much more predictable and the suspense doesn't work so well anymore, especially since we no longer have that expectation generated by seeing the doll for the first time.Child's Play2 misses the opportunity to use this to create a different clash between Andy and Chucky. With this, the logic is practically the same as in the first movie, where the boy simply tries to convince the others that the doll is alive while trying to survive him. At the end of the first one, he was already facing Chucky. It's bizarre to believe that Andy was really convinced that Chucky was just a brainchild, which also resets the entire evolution of the character, who, like Chuck, returns to his original state. And so the story goes on, piling up scenes that are sometimes absurd, sometimes tense, sometimes comical, in the right measure. The screenwriter Don Mancini and the director fail to bring little news to the film. In addition to the obvious changes in the boy's life, what we see once again is the boy's pursuit and many innocent deaths that cross Chucky's path, but in different settings. Chucky this time kills in a school, in a house, in a car in a parking lot, etc. There are also some scenes that are quite funny, like the one where he finds the other Good Guy doll, attacking him and burying him in the family's backyard, as well as other phrases that further emphasize the sarcasm so typical of Chucky.One of the interesting relationships is the pair Andy and Kyle. In the final stretch, the girl's fight to save the boy from the villain's clutches, with car chase rights, a race in a maze made by boxes of Good Guys dolls in a factory that produced them and the constant tension of not knowing where the doll is. The idea of the third act being in the factory was brilliant, well at least it was creative. Set the climax right at the Good Guy doll factory, where Chucky is fought off by Kyle and Andy. The setting is well used, and it's just a shame that there isn't a scene where Chucky gets mixed up with hundreds of dolls, confusing the heroes. But despite that, we have a long chase scene, plus one of the most bizarre deaths in the series.Chucky is more prominent in this movie. Early on he starts going after Andy, his appearances full of sarcasm and with excellent effects guarantee the fun. Another curiosity of this film in relation to the first one is that Chucky, as a doll, has changed. Less detailed people won't notice. Chucky's physiognomy as both Good Guy and the doll moving and making their bizarre expressions is more serious and realistic.The only thing that hasn't changed is the doll's internal transformation, organs and blood become part of his system over time, we can see this in parts like Chucky starts bleeding through his nose or when he cuts off his hand. Remember that the situations in the first movie take two days. In ""The Child's Play2"", the plot takes place over a period of three days, so there is a consistency of Chucky not being able to pass his soul on to Andy as he took longer than the first movie to try to do it.This sequel no longer has the freshness of novelty and does not maintain the same tension as the first one, but it undoubtedly also marked and was present in the nightmares of many in the 1990s. Child's Play2 is a really fun movie, which fortunately doesn't try to create a new masterpiece of horror, and cares only about having fun. The story doesn't stop, and there is always action going on. The doll's charisma carries the film, a credit to the doll team (at a time when CGI was not available) and, especially, to Brad Dourif, who was the sarcastic voice of the villain in all the films in the series.",Child's Play 2

The video quality isn't the best. Chucky looks more like a dark gypsy than any of the other actors. The interior sets are run-of-the-mill, but they used real locations for the exteriors. The photography of the scary scenes would have been so beautiful in high-def, but somehow the fact that it is not high-def lends a sort of creepy feel to the cinematography. The direction is a bit hit and miss and some of the editing seems choppy, especially near the beginning, but if you are able to put aside modern standards, somehow it all comes together into a rustic, very atmospheric, ghastly production.",Child's Play 2

It is well directed, well acted, and hits all the targets. On the other hand it is a movie I felt unclean watching. The idea of Chucky has lost what ever originality it had in the original film. Instead we get a genuinely evil character torturing a poor little boy for the film. I honestly think you'd have to be mentally ill to find entertainment in 'Child's Play 2'.I liked the original 'Child's Play' a great deal, and I even enjoy 'Bride of Chucky' a lot for it's camp entertainment value. I will say though that I absolutely hate Chucky as a character. It's no fault to Brad Dourif who is an excellent actor and gives some very good vocal work as Chucky. If anything Dourif makes me hate Chucky for all the right reasons. The problem I see with this picture is that it is staged so that Chucky is always the vocal point of everything. Alex Vincent isn't the main character of the picture. We are in a sense encouraged to follow Chucky and still despise him at the same time. It doesn't work.Many fans praise this film for it's black humor. I think this is actually one of the worst things about the film. Don Mancini has written a script that takes this little terror with utmost sincerity. Any joke involving Chucky isn't tongue in cheek, the viciousness is still there. Where as in the superior 'Bride of Chucky' Mancini recognizes the scenario as being very stupid and he plays off that for some brilliant jokes. I think I have to credit Mancini for why this film is terrible. He has written a grim hopeless opus for black souls. It isn't easy for me to do this. I've liked plenty of horror films that have been considered dark and too ugly by mainstream critics. It's a testament to Brad Dourif for taking Mancini's script and bringing it to this level.I think the biggest problem with the script is that Andy is completely alone in his battle with Chucky. Conceptually Mancini is ripping off his original 'Child's Play' to the keel. No one believes little Andy until the bodies pile up. This story is tiresome and unoriginal. Mancini recycles it over and over again but through different lenses. In my opinion he's a lazy screenwriter who struck gold with this character. The concept of a killer doll isn't original enough to recycle the same stories for this killer doll to inhabit. I wish Mancini put more time into his stories than he did into creating this little terror. I'm not praising Mancini in anyway for making Chucky so evil. Mancini was given a tremendous gift in having Brad Dourif respect him and take this role. If a lesser actor took it this character would have died off after the original film.In a sense I have to award Alex Vincent and Brad Dourif praise. They have taken these characters to the utmost degree. I feared for little Andy, and despised little Chucky.Director John Lafia is very good at creating pure horror, not suspense, not fear, but actual horror. He has given us a horrendous situation. To his credit he does it really well. The thing is thought that audiences don't like horror, they like simulated fear. 'Child's Play 2' in all it's silliness has genuine horror. Some sequences are genuinely hard to sit through because of Lafia's staging. He takes Mancini's awful script and really brings out the most in it. I think Tom Holland knew how to better frame this concept. He knew that audiences were attracted to the concept and not the character of Chucky. I could have fun with the original 'Child's Play'. I can't have fun here, not when there are real monsters in the world.",Child's Play 2
73,acidburn-10,Chuckys back,6,21 March 2009,"Chuckys back and he still wants to take over Andy's body. He hunts him down at a foster home and kills anyone who gets in his way.The first Child's Play movie was great, it was original and well done, and had moments made jump my heart jump out of my skin. But this time round it isn't as good or well done as the first movie but still passable. The storyline to this one is a lot weaker and the tension the first movie had isn't here this time round. But Chucky himself gets more screen time and more witty one liners which is a definite plus side to this movie.However the main characters in this movie aren't as interesting, we don't have Chris Sarandon or Catherine Hicks which is a shame, and the characters in this sequel aren't as well developed and so that makes the suspense watered down. Don't get me wrong this is still a fun flick to watch and better than some sequels out there, namely (Sleepaway Camp II, The Ring 2, The Grudge 2 etc), The Chucky puppet is way better this time around. He looks more evil and I loved that quick kicking he does every time he lunges on somebody. I didn't spot a midget in a suit in this entry. The kills are more creative and bloody (although the Joanne kill is a throw awayshe deserved better).Where the first one was more suspense oriented this one almost feels like a slasher flick. Gone is the humanity of the first or the novel storyline. Everyone is there so that Chucky could eventually have his way with them. This sequel is low on surprises but it's still good.Alex Vincent (Andy)is again a great young actor but his performance in the first one was a lot stronger than this time round. Christine Elise (Kyle) who walks through the movie never letting any emotions shine through. Nothing impresses this girl, not even a living doll!, but she shines in the final scenes as the main heroine this time around, Jenny Agutter (Joanne) has a sexy British accent and does what she has to donot much. Gerrit Graham (Phil) got on my nerves, he was extremely unlikeable and I was glad when he died and Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) does it again, going haywire with his unique voice.All in all Child's Play 2 isn't bad, it's a really good flick in fact but it lacks the tension the first one had. Also look out for the death scene at school where the teacher gets whacked with a ruler several times, has to be the best death in this movie.",Child's Play 2
74,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Sorry Jack Chuckys Back""",7,21 October 2019,The original Child's Play movie was terrifying and while it had a slow build up to the reveal of Chucky moving and talking it's sequal Child's Play 2 wastes no time in bringing the murderous killer good guy doll back to life and back to his old tricks again hunting down his best friend Andy Barkley played once again by (Alex Vincent) to transfer his soul into his body Andy now lives with a foster family after his mother was declared insane but and committed to a hospital for treatment but Andys first night in a new home won't be without a familiar face as Chucky infiltrates the house to finish what he started and once again no one believes him that Chucky is real and here to take his soul.This movie takes what was enjoyable about the first movie and adds to giving Chucky more screen time with even better effects than the first movie with better movement from the Chucky puppets movement's and facial expressions and with returning actor (Brad Dourif) voicing Chucky and given more screen time to work with Chuckys is given more of a personality cracking of jokes and one liners and being genuinely more scary than he was in the original.I recommend this movie to any horror movie fan this movie is a worthy sequel to the original Child's Play.,Child's Play 2
75,jp_91,As good as the first one!,10,9 September 2020,"""Child's Play 2"" is an amazing sequel, one of the best second parts ever made. Chucky is back for Andy beginning a killing spree.

76,Min111,Only succeeded due to Alex,6,5 March 2019,"The sequel was a successful one, but I still don't think it was as good as the first one. Child's Play 2 would've been better had the boy's mother and the detective returned for this instalment, but at the same time, it wasn't required because Child's Play 2 still worked nonetheless. The plot isn't as interesting as Child's Play, but it was still watchable. I only liked this because it still had the boy from the first movie in this, otherwise the movie would've miserably failed. Alex stole the show yet again, and it's a real shame he couldn't reprise his roles in the following movies. Child's Play 2, believe it or not, could've been way better than it already was, and at the same time, it didn't even need a sequel. It would've been fine either way. Whenever I see or think of these movies, I always see Alex Vincent v Charles Lee Ray battling each other, and the great/funny thing is that the boy wins. Many people think this may be the better of the two, but I think otherwise, and say Child's Play is the superior film.",Child's Play 2
77,TalesfromTheCryptfan,An awesome sequel that surpasses the original,9,10 November 2017,"2 years after Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) was attacked by his Good Guy doll Chucky (Voiced by Brad Douriff) and traumatized by the murders that happened. His mother backed up his killer possessed doll story in court and is taken away to an institute leaving Andy in foster care until his mother recovers, a nice kind couple named Joanne and Phil Simpson (Garret Graham and Jenny Agutter) adopts him and takes them to their humble home where he meets his foster sister Kyle (Christine Elsie) and befriends her. The burned destroyed remains of the Chucky doll is taken in by the Playpals company especially with CEO Mr Sullivan (Peter Haskell) to see that there is nothing wrong with it as it's just an ordinary doll and they rebuild him from scratch like brand new and gets revived. Chucky is once again on the loose killing off anyone that gets in his way to transfer his soul into Andy.A thrilling and exciting sequel to the 1988 horror classic is a sequel that surpasses the original! after the success of the original movie by United Arist, they greenlighted a sequel with David Kirschner who produces the series/created the Chucky doll along with writer Don Mancini who wrote the original movie as the sequel was put on hold by the studio when it was about to be acquired by Australian studio Quintex who decided in their best interest is not to do horror films. Various studios from Paramount, Fox, New Line Cinema, Carolco, Warner, Columbia and Touchstone Pictures but Kirschner turned it down so he can independently produce it and Universal bought the rights.This movie is directed by John Lafia whom did co-wrote the original movie's script does a great job directing this movie and this is Don Mancini's finest script besides the original and the Fitting Punsihment episode of Tales from the Crypt. The Cinemaphotography by Stefan Czapsky is very beautiful and crisp and has good style to it and we get to see what is behind the popular within the film's Good Guy dolls line known as Playpals toys and who is behind this. The kills are quite creative even the special effects/puppetry/make up effects by Kevin Yagher are even better than ever than the original as Chucky looks the best in this installment. I love the chemistry between Kyle and Andy as if they were actual siblings as they bonded and even talk to each other even have fun together doing choirs to swings and all that as i really like that for it felt quite realistic.The film co-stars Grace Zeberkinsi and Beth Grant and i love that climax set in the Playpals toy factory that is quite thrilling and edge of your seat excitement. This movie was a box-office hit and did very well for Universal and is very loved by fans to this day even me.",Child's Play 2

79,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,1 December 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Child's Play 2"" picks up where the first one left off (for the most part) with Alex Vincent reprising his role as the tortured boy, Andy Barclay. A big fan of the 1st film, I was really looking forward to seeing this one when it came out. I walked out with a smile on my face. This is a worthy sequel.After the events of the first ""Child's Play"", the Play Pals corporation takes the remains of the original Chucky doll and clean it up, restoring it to perfect working order. Evil must live in the blood, however, since Charles Lee Ray comes back for more madness and mayhem. Andy is now living in a foster home and it isn't long before the Good Guy doll finds him so that he can transfer his soul into the little boy. Aided by Kyle, a teen girl who also lives there, they venture into the manufacturing plant and with Good Guy dolls all around them, they fight a final battle.In the first movie, we had a few jump scares and it was a good mix of black comedy and horror. In this film, though, most of the horror elements go away. There is some gore, but nothing too heavy. You can't help but laugh and be entertained by this crazed, maniacal doll who is bent on becoming human again. Brad Dourif once more voices Chucky to perfection - especially with his trademark, irresistible laugh.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good horror/comedy. As sequels go, it is a good one. The story is fresh, the pacing moves you right along, and Chucky has never been in better form - even flipping the birdie with a sneer on his face. I love this one. A solid 8 stars out of 10.",Child's Play 2
80,Rickting,Cash grabbing horror sequel number 3000,4,2 June 2015,"Child's Play was a good horror film and Chucky is a cracking horror villain. Do we want to see more of him? Sure, why not? Do we want to see a complete rehash of the first film. That's a resounding no. Andy is now in a foster home, still affected by the events of the first film 2 years earlier. Unfortunately, the doll company rebuild Chucky in a typically unlikely and stupid horror movie plot point and Chucky goes after Andy again. The film has the same formula as the first: Chucky kills people and frames Andy for it, intending to transfer his soul into Andy. With a runtime of less than 90 minutes and a predictable rehashing of the plot points of the first, Child's Play 2 feels slight and more like an extended YouTube compilation of Chucky kills. Acting is better than one may think for a horror film. Brad Dourif is still excellent as Chucky, who is one of the best horror icons out there and Alex Vincent again puts in a good child actor performance. Another neat touch is his foster sister Kyle, who is a surprisingly good addition to the film.There are plenty of exciting moments, such as the finale in the Good Guy Doll Factory and Chucky can be quite amusing, but CP2 just isn't scary. There's no build up, no big reveal this time and Chucky reveals himself to Andy too quickly, showing a desperation to cut to the chase. The direction is nothing to write home about and the script is predictable, unimaginative and has various illogical and contrived moments. The film is gorier than the first, and horror filmmakers seem incapable of realizing gore is actually thoroughly tedious and this undermines the film as a result, contrasting heavily to the suspenseful and patient approach of the first film. CP2 gets boring very quickly, saved mainly by Chucky, who is a very good villain and an entertaining finale, although once again: Why. Won't. He. Die?!The soundtrack from the first isn't repeated in this one, and the film's main theme is less memorable. A watchable but lame horror sequel overall and apparently Child's Play 3 is even worse. An interesting comparison is the superior Halloween II. That succeeded because unlike this, that did something different, was actually scary and wasn't just about the kills.4/10",Child's Play 2
81,jhaggardjr,Creepy follow-up,6,20 July 2001,"""Child's Play 2"" is the first sequel to the popular 1988 original. The first film was a very entertaining horror film. The second movie in the series isn't as good, but it's not real bad either. However, the filmmakers took the gory route for this one. All the graphic violence makes it less effective. The first movie worked so well because it kept the violence down to a minimal. Oh the first film was violent, but not as violent as this one. But it's stylish look somehow makes it watchable. And, like the original, it's entertaining to watch. Young Alex Vincent reprises his role from the original as Andy Barclay, the boy who in this movie goes to live with foster parents while his mother seeks psychiatric help (from the events in ""Child's Play""). Andy himself still isn't all together, and when Chucky the killer doll re-enters his life again, watch out! ""Child's Play 2"" may not be as good as ""Child's Play"", but it sure is better than the next movie in the series, ""Child's Play 3"" (which I thought was awful). I haven't seen the fourth movie yet (""Bride of Chucky""), so I can't voice my opinion on that one at the moment.**1/2 (out of four)",Child's Play 2

It's always an interesting feat in horror to write the return of a villain that's been dismembered to the point of disrepair in previous entries, but Don and his crew pulled it off well with this movie.
Alex Vincent once again shines as the young Andy Barclay, now haunted by the past and trying to make his way without his mother by his side in a world where Chucky is undeniably still alive and out to get him. Brad Dourif's menacingly satanic sounds lend themselves once again to this spine-chilling entry.

Saying that so you nostalgic people don't get triggered. The movie is a light horror. It feels just like the first one, which is a good thing if you liked it. It's not very scary, it drags a little and get's boring with that ""I don't believe you routine!"". I know it's needed for the story, but you get really tired by it. This isn't some drama, it's a movie about a doll who is killing people. Anyway, the movie itself is cool, has some fun and tense scenes and above average acting.

85,DavidSim240183,Fun if you're in the mood for it,8,30 August 2011,"Amongst the slasher cycle of the 1980s, Child's Play was the last stab at unleashing a new horror monster on the populace, with Chucky the killer doll battling stalwarts like Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers. Even if the idea of a child's toy possessed by the soul of a serial killer sounded silly, Child's Play was more successful then it had any right to be, thanks to Tom Holland's confident direction and a smart screenplay.Although disowned by the studio, Child's Play was a hit. So Universal quickly bought the rights, eager to launch the character off on a new horror franchise. For Child's Play 2, direction has been handed over to John Lafia, one of the screenwriters on the original film. And unlike the Elm Street sequels, Chucky's encore is a good one.There's nothing stupendous about CP2, nor does it want to be. But John Lafia's direction elevates a thin script. The film abandons Tom Holland's sober approach. Its still very much a horror film, but a touch of black comedy has crept in as well. It isn't pushed to the extremes that Bride and Seed of Chucky would take it to, but you can see some of it in the film's gleeful tone and colourful set design.One of the things that became annoying about the Elm Street series was how they kept finding ways to resurrect Freddy Krueger. It didn't matter how many times they killed him off. They would just bring him back for the next instalment whether it made sense or not. And although you could make that same criticism of Chucky, CP2 does to its credit find a way to bring him back to life that isn't totally implausible.The toy company that builds the Good Guy dolls gets a hold of Chucky, or what's left of him. After he was shot to pieces and burned to a crisp at the end of the last film, the company want to know why one of them went on a rampage. They rebuild the doll from the guts up, but the spirit of Charles Lee Ray is still within it, and as soon as the doll is up and running, so is Chucky!Chucky has no intention of living the life of a plastic plaything, and there's only one person who can spare him that, Andy Barclay. Chucky's former owner is stuck in foster care, while his Mum has been carted off to the funny farm for backing up her son's ""insane"" claims about the doll. Chucky still needs to possess Andy's body, before he becomes trapped in the doll forever.Although Child's Play 2 is often seen as a soulless rehash, I'll admit I enjoyed it. Its certainly well made, and much higher budgeted than the first film. And John Lafia has a slick, firm hand on the material. Where the first film toyed with our expectations about Chucky, Lafia shows no such restraint. In part 1, we had to wait about 40 minutes before Chucky got to do anything. Wisely, Lafia just jumps right in and delivers Chucky at his murdering, swearing best.Kevin Yagher's puppet effects have come a long way in the two years since. Chucky is allowed more room to move, a range of malicious, animated facial expressions that don't look at all fake, and what with Brad Dourif reprising the role, leaping in with fast energy and zero inhibitions, Chucky is just as much a character as any of his flesh and blood co-stars.The other person who's polished his act since the first film is Alex Vincent. He was a little blank in Child's Play (even more so than Chucky!) but he's developed into a capable, sympathetic lead, and he gets strong support from Christine Elise as his foster sister. Gerrit Graham is stuck in a one-dimensional role and Jenny Agutter struggles with an American accent, but they both give decent performances as Andy's foster parents.Although horror sequels come in for a lot of stick, I must say Child's Play 2 is quite suspenseful at times. Like when Andy hunts for Chucky in a dark cellar, or Christine Elise's fight with Chucky in a master bedroom. And the film mounts to an effective climax at the Good Guys toy factory. Where the factory set becomes a bewildering backdrop of packing crates, conveyor belts and oxygen pumps as Andy fights Chucky to the death.There's never any doubt that Chucky will survive of course, but Child's Play 2 is a sequel that's fun, tight, with never a dull moment. Things you will never say about an Elm Street sequel.",Child's Play 2

If you're not already a member, after watching the films - you won't want to be.",4,26 March 2016,"Since I've already mentioned that I've only started watching the Chucky anthology recently (2016), I will this time attempt to sound less apologetic (yes, I should have seen it as a kid, I didn't, get over it). Chucky 2 is the beginning of the process to turn Child's Play to another classic Slasher series and establish his status as equal to Freddie or Jason. In my opinion - it failed miserably.In order for the process to set off on the right foot, the sequel has to at least top the original, which Child's Play 2 absolutely doesn't. I realize we're talking about a film that had been released 26 years ago, but understanding that bluntly stupid characters damage a film's effect (and reputation) isn't a 21st century notion. It's a doll, but it's becoming more and more ""human"" in regards to vulnerability. You have to destroy it's heart. Say it with me: Destroy. The. Heart. Chucky is menacing, frightening and evil, and is quite strong seeing as how it's a doll possessed by the soul of a deranged serial killer, but it's still a doll. Burn it to the ground, chop it to pieces with an axe, drop it into a tub full of acid, do something! Anything to make sure the heart is destroyed, if you're unable to stab it or shoot it! No. Instead, Alex Vincent (who's still unauthentic and unconvincing) and Jenny Agutter (also unimpressive, even in late 80's standards) insist on doing anything but actually killing the doll, regardless to countless opportunities and the fact Andy knows how to kill it, having witnessed his mother's past attempts. The plot and screenplay are completely irrelevant, since the entire film revolves around Chucky's superiority and his magical ability to completely disarm people of their logic and intellect.The good part? Chucky is adorable and hilarious (just what you want out of a Horror villain, right?). His facial expressions, trying to be more vicious and scary this time, reminded me of Mr. Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. Not a good sign considering this was supposed to be a scary movie. Also, making Chucky a comically cynical bastard in the footsteps of Freddie is nothing more than an unoriginal imitation. My fault, I know. I'm watching a kids film when I'm old enough to be a father. Still. This film isn't suitable for children (as it would scare them too much), and is a joke to adults. If you watch it, it would probably be for the 1000th time, but if you're a first timer - do yourself a favour, and go watch A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th.

The story is probably the weak point of this movie, as it runs dry a lot and becomes even tiresome. However, Chucky is able to show us a good time still. He starts to show some of his famous humor here and is actually able to make people laugh as he kills or causes destruction. The first movie had little or no comedy in it but was able to be very eerie. This movie isn't very eerie at all but is a little funny. The actors were OK for the most part, none really bad. But Chucky was definitely the highlight of this movie.

91,DigitalRevenantX7,Better than the original.,5,12 January 2010,"Following the success of CHILD'S PLAY, the producers gave the green light for sequels to appear. The only difference is that Universal took the film rights, ending up producing all the sequels so far. The only returnees are scribes John Lafia (who has taken the director's chair) & Don Mancini, the producer & visual effects people, as well as stars Alex Vincent & Brad Dourif.The Play Pals toy factory has obtained the burnt remains of Chucky & sets out to discover the fault by rebuilding it. Returning to life, Chucky tries to track down Andy Barclay who, following his mother's committal to an asylum, has been sent to live with foster parents Phil & Joanne Simpson. Things don't go according to plan, with the doll resorting to murder in order to get to Andy.To be quite frank, I didn't really like the original film. It was, as some critics have pointed out, extremely silly. The concept had a limited idea – that of a killer doll doing a Freddy Krueger - & was full of ridiculous plot twists (the idea that a person could transfer their soul into a doll is bad enough, but having its body turning human & only being able to transfer again into the first person to uncover its secret is just plain ludicrous). I first saw this sequel when I was a child & it unnerved me. Watching it today, I ended up laughing.While it is stuck with the same stupid plot as the original, Child's Play 2 is actually better, mainly due to Lafia making some scenes truly suspenseful. There's a scene where Alex Vincent hunts Chucky in the dark basement, which has a commendable tension, as well as the teenage girl cornering it in the bedroom. Don Mancini's script is a lot better than his previous work, but still has some dead spots, making the Child's Play series the filmic equivalent of an M60 machine gun – in the sense that both the films & the weapon started out as very poor designs & have now reached a high standard of mediocrity.The other thing about the film is Chucky himself, killing people while spouting one-liners. The doll effects are better this time around, with the doll's features looking more human than doll. The climax, where Chucky is slowly destroyed piece-by-piece (first he loses his hand, then his lower half, then is covered with molten plastic & finally blown up with an air pump) is similar to the climax of THE TERMINATOR, although not as good as that film ever was.One of the script's strengths is that it conducts things in a more believable manner than the first film. The doll is rebuilt in the toy factory (although I don't think that, after the technicians completely build the doll from a burnt skull, they should use a machine to insert the eyes – can't they do it themselves?) in order to unearth the reason it turned deadly, while Catherine Hicks is sent to the loony bin because she backed up her son's story in court.On the acting front, Jenny Agutter (fans of war films will recognize her from THE EAGLE HAS LANDED) & Gerrit Graham do a good job as the foster parents, while Brad Dourif delivers another good performance as the wisecracking Chucky. Alex Vincent, who I thought was a whiny brat in the first film, has grown up (if only slightly) & does the kid-in-distress thing a lot better than he did in the original.",Child's Play 2
92,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,OK sequel,4,19 June 2008,"Unlike the first (great) and the fourth (bad) this movie falls squarely in between somewhere. After apparently being retrieved from Andy's mom's fireplace, a greedy play pal's company orders the pint-sized serial killer rebuilt to salvage the corporation's understandably faltering Pr image. Once reborn, Chucky decides to track down Andy and pickup where he left off. Andy is sent to a foster home that looks like the parents rake in billions taking care of foster kids. Given their young age, and the realities of foster parent payment, one can only guess how they got the perfect house that Barbie must have built. It's difficult to pinpoint how many rooms this thing has, but it must dwarf the white house for space, and is too sterile and quiet for a child's haven. Kyle, a perpetual foster kid, is Andy's new sidekick in the film. She is a streetwise young woman who does not take any garbage from anybody and ultimately helps Andy destroy Chucky.Another problem I had with the film stems from the domineering teacher. I never thought I would say this (and please note, I am not endorsing school violence in anyway) but congrats to Chucky for taking out Ms. Kettlewell after she completely humiliated Andy in the classroom in front of his peers. Granted, there is an inconsistency because the whole mess started with Chucky writing bad words on Andy's paper about the teacher, but she was just so unlikeable to begin with.",Child's Play 2
93,Rendanlovell,Cash grab,3,17 July 2020,"Man, the quality really fell off a cliff between the original and this. Outside of the Chucky action, this is quite the chore to sit through. It feels incredibly cheap and stretched thin. Most of the film takes place in one location, a boring house. It's scene after scene of Chucky doing something and someone not believing Andy about it. The film opens directly after the events of the original with the burnt up chucky being repaired. Then for the entire film chucky attempts to inhabit the body of Andy, just like the original. It's an incredibly uncreative story. The weirdest part is that it doesn't even make 90 minutes. This is the shortest Childs Play movie and yet it can't come up with anything for these characters to do. Kyle is a foster kid that befriends Andy but seems to not have a life outside of that? She mentions a date and a job but you don't see that ever. It would've been mice to get to know her character but no, she's kinda there. Andy is exactly the same as the original with nothing outside of running from Chucky to do. All the other characters are cannon fodder. I can't say I hated this though. When the film finally moves out of that stupid house it gets pretty fun. Chucky is hilarious and everything with him is great, especially that whole Good Boys distribution factory set piece. That all is clever and fun. There's a guy that gets his eyes replaced with doll eyes, theres a bunch of acid, and chucky gets exploded by an air compressor of sorts. It's wonderful chaos, exactly what I want in one of these movies. Again, the problem is everything else. The film feels so utterly uninspired, as if they slapped this together in a weekend to grab some cash. The direction is bland, the story is dumb, and the characters are all underdeveloped.",Child's Play 2
94,kylehaines96,"Did You Miss Me Andy, I Sure Missed You(***1/2 Out Of ****)",9,11 December 2012,"After the 1st film had hit it big with both the critics and the people, it was time to continue the story of the murderous doll. Don Mancini returns to write and cast members Alex Vincent and Brad Dourif return to reprise their roles from before.The film starts out with Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif being rebuilt after his crispy end at the end of the first film. He tracks down Andy played by Alex Vincent and finds out that his mother(sadly not seen at all in the movie) was sent to a mental institute after defending her sons story about a killer doll. Andy goes to live with a foster family but after multiple mishaps involving the killer doll and the death of his foster dad(Guess Who?) Andy is sent back to foster care where Chucky takes him and his foster sister Kyle(Hey that's my name!) hostage and takes them to a toy factory for a climax that is now infamous in the horror community.The problems I have with this film are 2 very minor things. The first is the story. It feels like it is trying to be a copy of the first film just in a different story(I'm looking at you The Hangover Part II). The second is the doll effects. The special effects for the doll still look good but they feel a little lacking in comparison.Now onto the good stuff. First I like how Andy is now sent into foster care because it gives him new people to interact with. Now even though I complained about the mother not being in the film, I am glad that there are new people because if the mother was in here than this would be a blatant copy of the first film.Next the acting. Alex Vincent still does a good job but feels a Little stale than the first one. Of course Brad Dourif is fantastic as the voice of Chucky. The foster family does an o.k. job, and thats about the main cast of the film.Lastly the climax of the film which takes place in a toy factory. My favorite film critic that is not based online, Roger Ebert and his colleague the late Gene Siskel stated that they thought this was a poor film but praised the last 15 minutes. The last 15 minutes are the best because it takes place in a giant toy factory where Chucky could be anywhere.The final verdict for Child's Play 2 is 3 1/2 stars out of 4, and it does earn my seal of approval which is earned by films that earn 3.5 or 4 stars. The films had good acting, a new setting which does work out and of course the 15 minute climax in the toy factory is the cherry on top of the sundae. Les this film does show Chucky come alive a lot quicker(17 minutes in) but it still is a good movie albeit flaws.Rated R For Horror Violence/Gore, Including Terror And For Language.1hr 24min/84min.9 uses of the F-word.Cost: $13,000,000.Box Office: $35,763,605.IMDb Rating: 5.3/10.Rotten Tomatoes Rating: 43% Rotten.My Rating: ***1/2/****",Child's Play 2

96,ReelCheese,Great Horror Fare!,8,24 July 2006,"It's difficult to accept the numerous poor reviews this movie garnered, particularly those from bona fide horror buffs. Of all the films within major horror series stretching from the late '70s to the '90s -- Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween among them -- ""Child's Play 2"" deserves a place very close to the top.This sequel picks up two years after the original in which young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) was tormented by Chucky, the killer-possessed doll trying to transfer his soul into the child's body. With his mother traumatized, Andy is sent to live with a foster family. Trouble is, there's a certain rebuilt Good Guy brand doll all too eager to get reacquainted.""Child's Play 2"" is solid horror fare. It has legitimate thrills as the seemingly innocent doll plunges to murderous life in the blink of an eye. It has a smart, unpredictable storyline. Its strongest asset, however, is an exciting finale at the Good Guy doll factory in which Chucky, piece by piece, meets his maker. First he's forced to amputate his own hand (he replaces it with a knife blade). Then his legs are torn off in an unsuccessful maiming. Next he's showered in gallons of steaming hot doll plastic before finally having an electrical cord stuffed in his mouth, exploding his head into a thousand gooey pieces. Where do they come up with this stuff?There are plenty of other things to like about this picture. Its budget is much higher than that of the original, a fact that shows up in leaps and bounds on the screen. With the origin storyline out of the way, the sequel is able to focus solely on the excitement without getting bogged down in too many details. And Brad Dourif outdoes himself as the creepily frightening voice of the homicidal doll.""Child's Play 2"" established Chucky as a legitimate horror icon. Simply put, the series never again reached this high a caliber and probably never will.",Child's Play 2
97,zac-04879,Not as Fun or Startling,5,21 October 2021,"Child's Play 2 brings back Chucky, this time delivering complete absence of the original's charge and still falling short of new aims. Therefore, it's a real bummer that the possessed killer doll can't be finished with his slashings. It firstly means a poorer cast, who the writer decides each stick to the annoying ""the-kid-was-right-all-along"" sorts of characters.Thankfully, Brad Dourif and Alex Vincent haven't changed their characters, with the evil killer doll targeting the innocent child. By that, we obviously get the same kind of structure as the original. The massive fans might hopefully get a kick out of this sequel. Nothing has changed...If anything, it's a lot dumber, sillier and fails to deliver the messages in a clever way. However, this Child's Play instalment isn't overly bad. Somewhat alike the original, it's often entertaining, but it loses its enthusiasm as it drags along. The storyline seems to also run pretty decently.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Child's Play 2
98,happyendingrocks,"Chucky: ""Wanna play?"" Me: ""Sorry, not so much this time.""",4,13 June 2012,"This unnecessary, but inevitable, sequel to Tom Holland's surprisingly nifty original serves as a somewhat logical continuation of the events of the first film, but despite Chucky's frequent and insistent outbursts of maniacal glee, Child's Play 2 isn't ultimately all that much fun.Last seen as a charred plastic doll-corpse, Chucky is made pristine once again by a team of witless toy company executives, who conveniently restore his damaged frame good as new in an effort to prove that the scenario in the first movie couldn't possibly have taken place (this is one of many dicey plot issues you'll have to overlook if you have any prayer of making it through this film). Of course, this make-over brings Chucky raring to life (with the ability to shoot electricity out of his eyes, naturally) and sets him free to embark on another killing spree.The story follows returning ""friend to the end"" Andy as he is shuttled to a foster home while his absent mother undergoes a psychiatric evaluation. The ever-resourceful Chucky very quickly tracks Andy down and resumes his quest to transfer his soul into the lad's body, knocking off a few random victims along the way, and the film quickly settles into the same ""nobody believes me"" motif that we saw the first time out.Andy's foster guardians are predictably clueless, and they even keep another Good Guy doll around the house despite their pre-awareness of that precise toy's status as the root of Andy's trauma. Like most of the characters in the film, they exist primarily to provide a body count, though the deaths here are notably tepid and bloodless, and in some cases downright silly (Chucky dispatches a disciplinarian teacher by beating her to death with a ruler, duh-dun-dun).Kevin Yagher's Chucky effects are as excellent as they were the first go around, and while I'm not sure how the mechanical puppetry will resonate with modern audiences used to lazy CGI trickery, those who relish the days when special effects were created by skilled and imaginative craftsmen instead of computers will marvel at how effectively Yagher's team brings our cuddly killer to life. It's fitting that Chucky is the best thing about this outing, but since his presence was augmented by a tight story and well-orchestrated suspense elements in the original Child's Play, watching him simply go through the motions here isn't nearly as engaging as we've already witnessed it could be. Despite the rich camp value inherent in the material (later explored to much more satisfying effect in future installments), Child's Play 2 is an oddly mirthless affair, and only one of the sight gags (which is, subsequently, literally a ""sight gag"") provides a modicum of the gallows humor rampant in this film's predecessor. The rest of the movie's attempts at bits are a tad too self-aware to be clever and largely fall flat as a result. While I'm certainly not arguing that we should expect brilliant bon mots in a sequel to a film about a homicidal doll, a bit more levity beyond Chucky's mostly droll one-liners would have been refreshing here.A rare Emily Valentine sighting (if you get the reference, you'll enjoy her presence immensely) provides a minor point of interest, but unfortunately I don't have too many other reasons to recommend this film. Even the overlong and unexciting climax fails to generate any real thrills, and since we already know going in that Child's Play 3 is on the horizon, Chucky's concluding comeuppance doesn't have a whole lot of impact.Child's Play 2 isn't unwatchable, but it does offer up only the most paltry of reasons to justify its own existence. You'll assuredly have a bit of fun along the way, but I simply can't conclude that the meager morsels being dished out here are worth 83 minutes of your life.",Child's Play 2

And I wasn't disappointed. I was quite startled to realize that Andy's mother made no appearance in the film, nor did Mike the cop but this film still had that feeling that the first one had.SPOILERS*******SPOILERS****BIG SPOILERS*** The film starts off with Chucky's doll being recreated, and immediately I realize that this isn't one of those films that are simply creating a sequel for money. I realize that there is a purpose and the film is gonna be full of good things. I was looking forward to it.Then the film slows down a bit, back to Andy who is placed in the care of two adults named Joanne and Phil along with a girl named Kyle. They talk about how ridiculous Andy's story of the doll being alive was. There is still some moments.Chucky attempts to get after Andy a few times and now I was really into the film. Andy begins school and there is a brilliant scene with Chucky killing one of Andy's teachers. I was laughing and enjoying this film.The body count continues and its left with only Kyle and Andy. Andy is kicked out of the house by Joanne, and she is later killed. One of my favorite scenes was when Kyle drove the car with Chucky in it, and outsmarts the doll. Chucky attempts to destroy Andy after realizing that he has become full human, but is saved in time by Kyle. The two attempt to kill the dog in the Good Guy dolls factory!!! The last fifteen to twenty minutes were intense and hilarious.**END OF SPOILERS*** The film ends brilliantly and I thought that this was a worthy sequel.

""This is his Uncle Charles.""",6,10 May 2020,"After Chucky's fiery death from the original the Play Pals Corporation that make the Good Guy dolls has gotten a hold of the doll to reassemble it and give stockholders a positive message after the disaster with Andy Barclay. Kind of a flimsy reason in my mind as I personally could not see a company doing this, but it doesn't wreck the film by any stretch. Within the first five minutes you see that Chucky's back and all he wants to do is find Andy (Alex Vincent) to get inside his body and out of the plastic doll.All in all a good horror movie, but just doesn't hit the heights that the original one did. Also starring Jenny Agutter and Gerrit Graham who are Andy's foster parents as Andy's mom is now in a psychiatric hospital. As well as Christine Elise as Kyle who also lives in the home and Brad Dourif is great in returning to voice Chucky. Elise does a good job, because I find she in fact carries the film a bit. Vincent as well is doing a much better job in the acting department. He is much less annoying and whiny, he actually puts in a good performance.The film also has a really good ending and the 3rd act is the strongest. In fact the movie just gets better as it goes along. Must say though that when Andy and Kyle get caught in the maze of Good Guy dolls it reminded me of The Shining.Written by original creator Don Mancini and directed by one of the writers from the original John Lafia. Some good music from Graeme Revell. Once again though it is the work of Kevin Yagher in creating the Chucky doll. Great work and still impressive.",Child's Play 2

Andy Barclay is still being stalked by the evil Chucky doll possessed by a serial killer. The goal for Chucky is once again to take over Andy's body (using voodoo) before he becomes trapped inside the doll forever. In part two, Andy's mother is in a psychiatric hospital following the events from the original so he has to stay with foster parents. Meanwhile the company that makes Good Guy Dolls is back in business and creates a whole new line of the product. The burned killer doll from the first is cleaned up and ready for promotion. This is how Chucky is resurrected. He ends up killing many people around Andy along the way.This sequel is a little more scarier than the original. Child's Play was more of a crime/thriller, while part 2 is all horror. The deaths are gorier and scares are plentiful. The acting is pretty good, but I always wished Catherine Hicks would've came back as Andy's mother. I liked the big finale in the huge toy factory where Andy has to run through a maze of a thousand Good Guy Dolls. Very original and suspenseful.While not as great as the original, Child's Play 2 is a pretty good follow up. Definitely an addition to the shelf of any horror fan.7/10",Child's Play 2

105,Mr_Censored,A Fun Sequel That Doesn't Skimp on Thrills.,8,25 January 2010,"You just can't keep a Good Guy down, and in this sequel to 1988's ""Child's Play,"" Chucky the killer doll (Brad Dourif) returns to haunt his friend 'til the end, Andy (Alex Vincent). Now under foster care following the events of the first film, Andy is just getting his life back together when Chucky shows up to play, and once again, has a Hell of a time proving to everyone that he is innocent.Although it lacks the sheer suspense of the first film, ""Child's Play 2"" is still a good time. With Chucky now taking a more prominent and vocal role (a.k.a. more wise-cracks than before) the film gets by with some improved special effects, a few truly grisly death scenes and a superb score by Graeme Revell. The direction by John Lafia has more of a funhouse feel to it than the first, but is more than appropriate for the kind of film it is. The film caps off with a face-off in the factory that serves as the birthplace of Chucky and his fellow Good Guys that is both outlandish and thrilling. With its smooth pacing and tight script, not a moment is left to waste and at no point does it drag or try to repeat the first film in any way.Despite the fact that it's not quite up to par with its predecessor, ""Child's Play 2"" goes a long way with its premise in delivering a razor-sharp slasher that is as fun as it is morbid. Chucky truly comes into his own in the film as a creepy killer turned into a wise-cracker (ala Freddy Krueger) and, in turn, makes the film lighter fare than the first. Chucky fans will no doubt revel in its mean-spirited madness and as far as slasher sequels go, they don't get much better than this.",Child's Play 2
106,kingofdanerds,Beloved by horror fans everywhere. So why does it have a (as of Sept. of 2021) 5.9?,8,9 September 2021,"Horror fans everywhere are all over the place when it comes to getting a consensus on horror movie sequels. You will have a big amount of horror fans love a sequel that many other horror fans might find to be absolute garbage. But one horror sequel that I have seen get nothing but love from the horror community is the second film in the Child's Play series, Child's Play 2. After the success of the first film in 1988, a sequel was pretty much a given but the production company for the first film was bought out and the rights were given to Universal and a film was made and released in 1990. The film was directed by John Lafia and stars Alex Vincent, Jenny Agutter, Gerrit Graham, Christine Elise, and Grace Zabriskie. The film may not have received as much critical praise as the original did when released, but the film still made a profit. So much so that a sequel was made and released the following year.Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is put into a new foster home where he is still trying to cope with the trauma that he experienced in the first film. Little does he know, the killer doll Chucky has been resurrected and plans to find and hunt down Andy so he can transfer his soul from the doll body, to Andy's.Child's Play 2 is sometimes (more so often than not) considered to be superior to the original. In certain areas, the film does seem to improve but we are still getting pretty much the same movie in terms of story except this time, the film lacks the creepy atmosphere present in the first film. Yet, Child's Play 2 still remains entertaining. The film does not set out to be a direct rehash of the original. Tonally, the film is more comedic but does not go as far as some of the later sequels tend to go. I called the first film, not fully realized. This is the film where a lot of the series trademarks started ie. The use of comedy and the use of gore. I think the acting is fairly solid, if not better than the first film and the characters are perhaps more memorable this time around. We still have Chucky and Andy, but now we have Kyle (Christine Elise) who is Andy's foster sibling. Here, we have a strong female character who fends for herself fairly well. Brad Dourif is back again as Chucky and I will say that this is the best iteration of Chucky that will be seen in a while. Why? Well, Chucky in this film is effectively wise cracking and at times menacing as well. We have some great one liners. The special effects are far better this time around. The Chucky animatronic still looks fantastic and the gore effects look fantastic as well. I do feel the first film lacked in the gore department and it is nice for gore hounds like me to see some gore. The film is probably more well known for it's final act which is loads of fun to watch. No final act in this franchise will ever come close to it. Even people who did not overall like this film (like Gene Siskel), still found the final act to be amazing. With that all being said, this film has some continuity issues that are mostly present as the film starts which kind of ruins the first film a bit for me. Plus, I don't find the writing to be up to par here. If Chucky is in such a hurry to transfer his soul, why does he take so long? Little flaws like that don't bother me too much, but it is still present. A bit sloppy in the beginning, but it eventually resolves itself once the film picks up and gets going.Child's Play 2 may lack the atmosphere and overall creepiness that was present in the first film, but this film sets out to be a fun and wildly entertaining horror sequel that finally sees the character of Chucky come into full form.",Child's Play 2
107,Meredith-7,As inferior as a sequel can be,4,18 June 2000,"This was not a good film , it wasn't even a good horror film.  The first Child's Play has scenes of actual suspense, but this one is more jokey than anything else.  Some of the characters do die in fairly novel ways, but Chucky doesn't seem to have the zest that he had in the original.  There are some good special effects, especially towards the end of the film, and the puppetry being Chucky was excellent, but it seemed a bit of a waste of time. If they were going to put all this money and effort into making sure the special effects were good, then they really should have made sure they had some kind of storyline, and some reason to make the film.  As it stands the film seems cold, with as much inspiration in at as a McDonalds commercial. Stick to the first one only, if you are going to watch any of the Chucky films.",Child's Play 2
108,FKDZ,Incredibly funny continuation of the original.,7,24 September 2020,"So I've seen the original for the first time about half a year back, and I loved it. Just so fun. And this one doesn't really disappoint at all, especially interesting regarding horror sequels mostly being pretty poor.This movie lacked a bit of that initial suspense and build up you had in the first, but because we obviously already know whats up, it knows not the follow the same footsteps and really plays around with the living chucky right from the start.It makes up for that suspense not with kills, but with comedy. Mostly vulgar comedy, with the always fantastic voice acting for chucky most of the lines are funny and quotable. It doesn't have a lot of kills as a slasher, but some of them are creative like the doll eye-assembly machine, and sewing machine.Chucky is shown way more on screen than the first movie, and the puppeteering is just amazing, it's well done and it being a real doll just so much more engaging. In general though, I feel like they could've played around with him a bit more. Mostly he's either on screen, or off. I'd love to see him in the background sneaking around to add a bit more suspense. Most of the ways chucky shows up is through a jumpscare.Andy's foster sister Kyle is great as well. Although her tough attitude changed pretty quickly and they kinda do away with it after a few scenes.Now the final scene, its like some screwed up willy wonka factory. Such fantastic set design. It completely engrossed me in the movie. All the scenes there, fantastic especially when chucky wakes up with molten plastic on him, definitely a scary sight if you watched this back in the day as a kid. Now that I think about that the practical effects are also outstanding, especially memorable is the scene where chucky has to pull off his hand.The movie ends with chucky exploding and the two, Andy and Kyle walking out of the factory... to me it was a little bit abrupt, as I expected one more final scene of where they'd end up. But it's not that big of a deal because it leaves some freedom for the next movie. And there's probably the main issue, there is little character development besides Chucky finding out he can't escape his doll form anymore.All in all very enjoyable and definitely something I wouldn't skip watching again.7/10",Child's Play 2
109,tequila101,"A grim sequel, which becomes a disturbing vision",8,17 May 2012,"Watching Tom Holland's creepy doll classic, ""Child's Play"" was quite an excellent film, and till today it still holds up very well. I knew that going into ""Child's Play 2"", I was thinking two things at the time; 1. I knew it wasn't going to be better than the first one and 2. I knew that I was still going to love it.The story is quite solid as it is a straight-forward, very disturbing take on, where Andy is taken away from his mother, put into a foster home with an absurd woman named Joanne, her husband who is a twit called Phil and then the most coolest, absurd like teenager, Kyle. From here on, the Good Guy Doll company decide to remake the doll to prove there was nothing wrong with it at all. But once he's remade, the soul of evil mass-voodoo murderer, Charles Lee Ray comes back to life and seems to find poor little Andy, where he starts the terror again, only this time toying and torturing poor little Andy.I think that it was an excellent sequel. Even though it doesn't have the impact of the original, it still kept me in watch mode.The music score which becomes quite chilling and circus like by Graeme Revell is well scored and structured, where it is all paced well. Alex Vincent is Andy is still quite convincing and he seems to to still be in his roll, only though this time, his character seems to become more frustrated when no one believes him about Chucky trying to get him. The other actors all did an excellent job at their roles, very dramatic I must say.Although everyone was good, the real credit goes to Brad Dourif who pulled the voice off well. He seems to bring a more surreal humor to the doll this time, which I think is a nice touch as in the first one, he becomes quite scary and creepy. I also like how they made him look a bit different, to keep up with the time span (being two years apart).I also think setting it in a foster home and later a factory, doesn't strand too far away. Not like what Bride or Seed did, where they took the action everywhere. I think in order for a Chucky film to work, it has to remain in one or two places.One little problem I have is that this film, like the next three Chucky films do NOT have the impact like the first film. For some reason, I just loved the first film and I seem to always find myself watching that one the most. These sequels although done well, I just don't find them as memorable. But it really doesn't matter with ""Child's Play 2"", because even though it doesn't reach the potential like the original, it generally works very well, where the viewer can become distressed because of what Chucky does to poor Andy in this one.Overall, a great sequel that has it's dark and disturbing moments.8/10",Child's Play 2

111,shaun98,Slick sequel,6,22 October 2002,"*possible spoilers*If you recall the original ""Child's Play,"" it's surprising that cult film was actually a more subtle work than one would expect. Although it ended with a bravura climax with the demise of Chucky, the infamous killer doll, its buildup was slow and brooding. The result was to generate a degree of ambiguity regarding the truth about the situation. Was he really killing people, or were the murders the work of a sick little boy? There was a real sense of dread that made the film more of a dark fantasy than a straight horror movie. However, when the inevitable sequels came out, there was no need to adhere to this approach. The reality of Chucky's presence had been firmly established, so all that was left to do was to go all-out, to jump right in the action. ""Child's Play 2"" accomplishes its goals on that basis.
It's silly, but slick and entertaining. There are at least a few gaping plot holes, but it doesn't really matter. The film was made to simply give us a good ride, and it generally manages to accomplish that. I just didn't care too much about whether or not it made sense. Just accept it as one of these ""pop a can and enjoy"" movies. Director John Lafia knows the material can't be taken seriously, so he goes heavy on the style and treats us to a fast-paced film with plenty of showoff camerawork. In fact, it's arguably more immediately entertaining than the original, though the writing simply isn't as good--a few more twists would have helped a bit. The highlight is a thrill-a-minute doll factory climax.Alex Vincent was a solid child actor, and it's a shame his career never took off after the first two ""Child's Play"" films. A lot of movies, particularly in the horror genre, have grappled with the problem of annoying kids, but if nothing, ""Child's Play 2"" avoided falling victim to that unfortunate curse. Gerrit Graham adds very good support, outdoing his young colleague. His character, the foster dad, isn't too likable, but his matter-of-fact presence lends a degree of reality to the fantastic happenings. Christine Elise, as the foster sister, doesn't quite hit the bull's-eye, but she gives it her best shot. At first her character was obnoxious, but she eventually becomes more sympathetic and drops the nonsense. Finally, Brad Dourif delivers another warped Chucky voice performance. You could do much worse for a late 80's/early 90's horror sequel.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures",Child's Play 2
112,boyinflares,Fun sequel with a good cast,7,14 April 2006,"Child's Play 2 picks up not long after where its infamous predecessor left off, and straight into the film, the original Good Guy doll housing the spirit of the Lakeshore Strangler is being fixed up and Good Guys are back in action. While unfortunately, Chris Sarandon and Catherine Hicks do not return, they are at least mentioned, and given plausible reasons as to why they could not be in the movie. Innocent Andt Barclay (Alex Vincent) however returns, and is once again at the mercy of Chucky (voiced by the classic Brad Douriff) when Chucky traces Andy down to where he is living in foster care. From there, the typical mayhem follows, with plenty of doll-style murders, witty lines from Chucky and a great finale at the Good Guy doll factory.While the original Child's Play is a terrifying classic, part 2 is somewhat of a step down, only because one knows what to expect, for the most part. However, the cast are a great asset to the film. Alex Vincent is right on the mark in his role as Andy, Christine Elise is terrific as his foster sister Kyle, and Jenny Agutter adds a touch of class as their foster mother Joanne Simpson. Gerrit Graham plays her strict husband, and Grace Zabriskie is good in her role as the career at the orphanage. Beth Grant steals the moment in her small role as Mrs Kettlewell however. Overall, a fun sequel to the original, with a well rounded cast and plenty of thrills to keep one entertained.",Child's Play 2

There's no build up here since we all know how Chucky looks like- meaning this movie has much more Chucky than the first one. Right after returning to life Chucky is going back after his lil' victim from the first movie and this well-written shocker is going to knock your socks off with some scenes you will never forget.

Again Chucky runs around the whole move trying to transfer his soul, killing a few people on the way, trying to be funny. not much of a plot, just made to make a few more bucks from a little doll slicing and dicing the whole movie and of course being stopped at the end. No twists or turns, they try to use ""false scares"" to get the audience which doesn't work. Not a very good movie.",Child's Play 2
115,MovieProductions,"Save for the toy factory showdown, nothing new here",5,13 October 2013,"** out of (***)The first Child's Play surprised audiences with its decent tension build-up and likable characters, but with #2 going straight for the kills, the suspense is killed and Chucky is about a fraction of menacing as he was in the first. The problem is that Chucky is shown during the killings. This is a problem because when we're supposed to be cringing, we're laughing. The first did this perfectly because we only saw a silhouette of the doll, nothing else (sans the third act). If the doll HAD to be shown, maybe less screen time and witty jabs? Moreover, I had more fun when the film tried on different hats. For an example, the scenes between Andy and the other foster child, and how the values like family, trust, etc. are put to test. That alone made for an interesting character background, and I would've preferred to have that relationship carry on throughout the film as the doll slashed his way from victim to victim.The highly-talked about toy factory sequence does not disappoint either. The gore is amped up to about infinity, the races are on, and that's pretty much when the sh*t hits the fan. Too bad the whole film didn't have that spark. What would've made Child's Play 2 a more taut film? Dispose of the whole ""no one believes Andy"" subplot. It happened the first time, it just gets more ""been-there-done-that"" as it continues to happen. Furthermore, develop Andy and the foster child (as I previously stated). And less screen time on Chucky would pay off in spades. All in all, this is not a bad sequel. This movie could've gone in much worse directions as its future sequels (the abysmal ""Seed of Chucky""), but they should've just scrapped the material. The first by itself would've made for a terrific little thriller. Now that it's a franchise, all appeal is lost. Well on the brightside, if you like this little bugger, you have 4 more movies with him. As for the rest of us, we'll be re-visiting the original. So I guess everyone wins?",Child's Play 2

117,Snake-666,Unnecessary sequel which offers nothing new.,4,20 July 2003,"I've heard a lot of people criticise this movie, and the Child's Play' sequels for that matter, for being unnecessary and personally I have to agree. None of the sequels really offered anything that the original didn't and thus they became rather boring movies.Following the bad publicity of the Good Guy' doll after the Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) became public knowledge the aforementioned doll was removed from sale. Naturally nobody believes that the doll murdered anybody (Andy's mother is now institutionalised for backing her son's story up in court) but they do believe that Andy was somehow disturbed by his Good Guy doll Chucky'. Rumours have floated about that the internal tape may have been changed. The company that makes the Good Guy' dolls have decided to reintroduce their product and to quell concerns over the dolls the doll containing the spirit of Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore strangler, is manually re-assembled. Unfortunately the spirit of Charles aka Chucky is still resident and he once again resumes his quest to regain a human body, which puts the now fostered Andy in trouble once again.There's a little more bloodshed, a few more victims and more screen time for Chucky but all in all this movie is not particularly fulfilling. Fans of the original may be impressed by the extra screen time for the foul-mouthed, murdering toy Chucky, but on subsequent viewings the movie no longer stands up. The plot leaves a lot to be desired and the characters all seem rather wooden and unrealistic. A pre-Beverly Hills 90210' Christine Elise plays Kyle, the only character in the movie that may garner any audience sympathy and respect and even she seems dull and contrived throughout the movie. Child's Play 2' had no input from original creator Tom Holland and it certainly shows through as the general direction and execution of this movie is poor. The final ten minutes or so of the film are the only moments that really seem to shine through but this is too little, too late from writer Don Mancini and director John Lafia. Other than the finale it's just a far too logical next step from the original and tries too hard to capture the good parts of that movie without trying to improve upon them. A little more humour is added to the mix but still the movie offers nothing of any real distinction to be a satisfactory sequel. My rating for Child's Play 2'  5/10",Child's Play 2
118,Macleanie,Not a toy,6,18 June 2019,"So the Charles Lee Ray is back, however for a start it doesn't sit well with me how it follows on from the end of the first movie, Andy being in a foster home seems like an excuse for the films plot as there is no mention or sight of his loving mother who is totally fobbed off... yet we do get some more of the terminator like doll with a dirty mind, filthy language and a seriously bad hobby. Its all entertaining stuff though, Andy is back with a good performance and the foster home theme works well even if the Chucky reconstruction is another stupid and rushed idea. The climax is especially good and if your into this Chucky franchise this is one of the better movies even if the whole franchise feels like with some more creative minds could be a lot stronger.",Child's Play 2

That is how Chucky comes back. Andy is now in foster care while his mom is in a mental hospital. Andy's room is full of toys, including one Good Guy Dolls.  He freaks out at first.

It was released by Universal City Studios on November 9, 1990, exactly two years after the predecessor. There is less of a structured plot than in the original, and Chucky has more of a witty character than before.The film was regarded as being widely successful for a horror film, in its opening weekend - it took an estimated $10,718,520, with only 1,996 screens in the United States.

I think most of that had to do with the New York-setting, but I wanted to give Chucky another shot so today I thought I would Rent the sequel and see how it went.As fast as Chucky got his first kill on the list I knew what a thrill ride I was about to experience, not only does this movie contain bloodier kills than the first, but it also delivers extreme horror and suspense. I like that Chucky really got to shine and be the charmy killer-doll we all know and love. The actor of andy is also a mutch better actor in this movie.The third act is really clever done and has a lot of suspense and even scenes that are hard to watch (Eyeball scene and when chucky get's stuck with his hand).
The whole teacher kill is nicely done with suspense and great lines from Chucky.Final Thoughts:
While the first one felt like a horror movie for 8-year olds, this one is mutch more ""severe"" when it comes to horror, kills, one-liners, suspense and even fights! 9/10 from me!",Child's Play 2

Anyway, get across this seemingly silly plot detail, and you will enjoy this film.The first film was an out-and-out horror. This film introduces a lot of comedy, thanks to the unique voice of Brad Douriff who voices the villainous doll! He obviously relishes his insane laugh, for he laughs every time he bumps anyone off!This, as I said, is a better film than the first, and that is due to the fact that there are more killings, people die in more improvised ways, as if the doll were making it up as he went along! And the endless fight for survival by the two lead characters - Andy and Kyle.Kyle?! - FOXY LADY!!! another reason why this film is better!! Typical male pig eh??!!

Well what can I say, if you've seen the original movie you probably realize what this sequel is about. Chucky the killer doll, with the inhabited soul of a madman, is back again! And he's angrier, and more sadistic, and wielding more corny one-liners than ever. All Chucky fans remember that he was burnt to a toasty crisp in the first movie. However in order to dispel rumors that Chucky ever came to life, the business that makes the Good-Guy Dolls decides to preposterously rebuild him, and show the public nothing is wrong with the doll. When they do this, Chucky comes back to life and sets out to find Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent). The kid he needs to voodoo in order to come back to life as a human. Chucky finds Andy in the hands of his new foster parents Phil (Gerrit Graham) and Joann (Jenny Agutter), and a stepsister Kyle (Christine Elise). Andy realizes that Chucky is after him, but as always nobody believes the youngster. Until the crazy, psychotic doll begins running out of time to turn human again, and sadistically murders anyone in his way of Andy.First things first, the original Child's Play is a campy classic, Child's Play 2 is not. Whereas the original had a way of composing itself with fine suspense and acting, which helped shut out the corniness of its doll-come-to-life plot. This utterly puke-inducing sequel has no way to take itself seriously at all. It happens in a lot of horror films with a lead slasher. Freddy Kruegger fell victim to crappy one-liners, Jason Voorhees turned out to be a frady-cat loser as a kid (Freddy Vs. Jason), and even Michael Myers got his butt kicked by Busta Rhymes. The only slightly creepy thing about Child's Play 2 is the ending, which takes place in the Good-Guys Doll Factory. But that can't save this ludicrously over-the-top slasher sequel. The acting is mild, the script only gets creative with the kills, and even the kills are more unsettling than scary.The few parts where Chucky kills somebody go too far over the top, to the point where you almost (or may) laugh at them. While they were a bit creative, I was repulsed by them in every imaginable way. There is a random, grotesque kill where Chucky pushes an innocent man onto a conveyor belt, and he is killed when doll eyes are punched into his face. It's scenes like this that, while creepy, really cross the line. Horror fans may enjoy a movie with nasty kills. But for me there has to be something to back it up, or it's just a senseless kill. I think it's absolutely disgusting how Hollywood glorifies murder on screen nowadays. It's only gotten progressively worse over the years after Child's Play 2. This review is being written in 2008, and the theaters are filled with Saw, Hostel, and more torture, torture, torture! I don't understand why people are so intrigued by gore. What fascinates audiences so much with it that it makes big money in ticket sales? A person gets killed on screen and there's no tragedy, but yet everyone gets upset and mourns when someone dies in real life. There's a word for that and it's called ""Hypocrite"".Child's Play 2 is an awful horror film. The poster art is scarier than the movie itself. Chucky did not deserve to have a horror series because in my opinion he's one of the worst horror icons since the evil killer Leprechaun. However I do have to give it points for its eery, creepy ""playtime"" atmosphere (such as the doll factory scene). I give Child's Play 2 a 1 out of 4. It's a gruesome 84 minutes, and for me it was too inhumane and it just wasn't worth it. Child's Play 2 was followed by 3 more sequels...Oh brother!",Child's Play 2

Now placed with a foster family while his mother recovers in a mental institution, Andy is hunted and tormented by the possessed killer doll, Chucky, once again. You also get really drawn into the film as well as the new characters, such as the teenage foster sister, Kyle (played by Christine Elise) who is my favorite character besides Chucky and Andy in this film. Kyle was such a badass and showed little to damn near NO fear of Chucky. Kyle wasnt gonna be bossed around and play Chucky's psychotic games. Loved Kyle and how badass and tough she was! Wish we could have seen more of her in the later sequels (but she did have a small cameo at the end of Cult of Chucky).

Kind of annoyingly, Andy's mom was sent to a mental house because she claimed that Chucky was real, which he really was.

135,Horror_Metal,Chucky is back in this excellent sequel!,10,11 October 2013,"Two years ago, young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) was terrorized by a killer ""Good Guy"" doll named Chucky. Chucky was possessed by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) and the only way he could become human again was to transfer his soul into Andy's body. After murdering several people, the evil doll was burnt to a crisp and dismembered by Andy's mother which effectively put an end to his crimes. No one believed Andy's mom and she was taken away to a mental correction facility for her crazy story. The now eight year old Andy has since been placed into a new home with foster parents Phil Simpson (Gerrit Graham), Joanne Simpson (Jenny Agutter), and their adoptive daughter Kyle (Christine Elise). Meanwhile, Chucky has been reconstructed by the company that manufactures the Good Guy dolls in order to prove a point. Knowing that Andy is his only means of becoming human again, the murderous doll immediately goes after the poor boy and will kill anyone who gets in his way! I will never understand the bad things that I sometimes hear about this sequel, it's great! Sure the first film is way scarier and more suspenseful but here we see way more of Chucky and his one liners, which are both cruel and hilarious. Most of the adults in this film are very unlikable and I've heard people complain about that, but it makes it all the more satisfying when they meet their fate at the hands of Chucky! The killer doll is once again voiced by Brad Dourif, who is a huge favorite of mine and never fails to deliver those lines with such wicked devotion. No one can ever replace Brad and you can tell he loves being the voice of Chucky. Alex Vincent is also on top of his game here as Andy from the first film and delivers a structured and layered performance. He has great chemistry with Christine Elise who plays Kyle, his foster sister. This sequel has some of the best kills of the whole series and I also love the action-packed finale in the toy factory. This movie isn't quite as good as the original but I will still give it a perfect rating as seeing more of Chucky is always a good thing.

You don't hate them enough to want them to die, or like them enough to care what happens to them, so you end out with just some 'people'. You don't know them, you don't like them, you don't care. The only character I ever had interest in was the adopted sister, and even her character wasn't that great. The animatronics and puppetry are amazing though. Chucky walks, stands up, and makes complicated gestures on screen. His movement looks very realistic without any CGI, and I found this very impressive. The soundtrack is good, but at some times a little too familiar to other horror films scores. The kills in this film are also not that effective as scary, due to the fact that there is calm time between many of the murders. They end up coming off as slightly overly gruesome, making it even harder for the movie to be fun.

A machine malfunction is what causes him to be alive again. This movie holds a place in my heart as I remember seeing it at a young age and it's what got me into the horror genre.This is a step up from the original in my opinion, there's more chucky motion, more of brad dourifs voice acting and more killing. One of the best in the series. The effects of the doll are amazing in this only being 2 years after the original. Also the final battle in the movie is amazing.",Child's Play 2
140,itakethesquare,this is probably the most important killer doll movie ever made!,10,9 March 2021,"If you are in your early 30's like I am you remember as a child you were afraid yet tempted to look at this VHS at your local Blockbuster.It's by no means a perfect movie. I'm giving in a 10 because there's no other killer doll movie that could top it. Simple as that. Mancini is a horror mastermind that combines comedy and horror. This is definitely not a movie to show to your kids even though my parents showed it to me, it haunted every dream I've had since I was 7. It took until I was 16 when I watched all of the Child's Play movies to realize that the FIRST Child's Play is the one you are supposed to take ""seriously"", as it is a more serious movie. However, the first movie is more of a thriller than a horror movie. This movie is , in fact, the scariest Chucky movie and has more comedy than the first movie and third movie combined.I can't explain it. This movie is so much fun to watch and is a classic. It has great animatronics, no cgi, great gore, and hilarious dialogue from the great Brad Dourif.

They talk about him like ""we get used to him"" and ""he needs more attention than we can give him"". Nice people that should get killed by the murderous puppet Chucky. Somehow the original 1988 film had a way better cinematography. This time everything looks like a terrible home video. Welcome to the 90s, I guess? It's corny. It's cheesy.

Alex Vincent also returns play Andy Barclay. Christine Elise plays Kyle In this movie. This movie is also one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is gorier than the first. The climax of the movie is better and is fun, exciting, scary, gory, suspenseful and disturbing. Chucky is even more evil in this movie. His lines are more clever and catchier as well. The animatronic have improved and are superb. The kills are cool. The scene where Chucky hides in the closet and jumps out and stabs Ms. Kettlewell with the ball pump and pushes her out of the closet into a row of desks. He then walks out of the closet with a yardstick and says ""You've been very naughty Ms. Kettlewell."" and slams the yardstick on his hand. He then walks over to here with a very frightening smile. The he beats her to death. That is a very disturbing and scary scene. There is another scene where Chucky and Kyle are driving to get Andy and the talk and are stopped by a police officer. The officer notices Chucky and asks his name and Chucky replies in his normal voice ""Chucky."". The movie perfectly filmed. The movie is fun to watch. It gets a 10/10.

The doll effects are an improvement on the first and Chucky is a lot better used in this film.However the story itself is better than expected as Chucky was in Part 3 a lot of the film and that film was pants.The film is funnier and scarier than the first (though none of the films have been that scary) and it was a lot more exciting.This film uses the gore sparingly and is much more effective than the bloodbath in the third movie which was just dull.If you're going to watch any of the Child's Play films, make it this one or the first, or if you're having trouble getting to sleep watch Child's Play 3.",Child's Play 2

146,KillerRomance,Charles Lee Ray is back and who says Damballah's Lighting doesn't strike twice?,9,11 May 2017,"I wrote a review​ ""Chucky is made of extra cool nightmares on wax"" over a decade ago on the original movie under my other username Cadillac_ghost In this second installment of the Child's play franchise. The outline of the movie takes place two years after the fateful date of November 9th 1988 which the Death of Charles Lee Ray the Lakeshore Strangler and Andy Barclay's sixth Birthday. Karen Barclay from the first movie was taken to a psychiatric hospital as described by one executive who is later killed by Chucky and led to track down eight year old Andy settled with foster parents (Garrett Graham, and Jenny Agutter from American werewolf in London) in the middle class west side of Chicago and his nightmare is relived, it is up to adopted teenage older sister Kyle (Elise from Beverly Hills 90210) to come to the rescue like a Karen Barclay surrogate mother to protect him​.This is more of a fun house ride and more comedic lines and scenes than the original, some of the scenes is funny (watch out for the wonderful Beth Grant from Donnie Darko as another witchey poo Teacher role and Grace Zabriskie from Servants of Twilight, the photocopy death scene was being ripped off by many action movies in its day) the special effects on Chucky are at best here, I liked the way he moves in this movie and really seemed demonically possessed for real, and his catchphrases are superb. The legendary Brad Dourif reprise the flair role of Chucky's vocals and does it with style and different moods from savagely intense rages of a serial killer to goosebump gentle whispers, and he is born to do this. The voodoo incantation scene is so absorbing and so well done - Chucky can be ruthlessly evil and selfishly wants to get to his goals of wanting to experience flesh again, and one minute he is cute and adorable looking as a munchkin. The murder scenes are more creative than the original. You don't want the dazzling movie to end, so abuse the repeat button if you must. That movie is timeless and never ages",Child's Play 2
147,utslitt,Really?,5,5 July 2019,"Outside of the fact there's a talking doll as antagonist, the film heavily relies on the incompetence of literally every adult to sell the plot of this. Even considering he's only a child, Andy's decision making skills are capital P-O-O-R, so if I were him I'd be beyond ecstatic about all that endless plot armor he seems to have.Despite those complaints, there are some good things about the movie. First up, the LIFE given to Chucky both in regards to animation and voice acting are spot on, and didnt miss a beat in making this villain seem so gosh real! Secondly, and lastly, the deaths were pretty creative. I got a good chuckle out of some of them!",Child's Play 2

Chucky is simply trying to possess Andy's soul while occasionally making a kill. While no story, it's pretty entertaining, but has some boring parts. Tons of false shocks and some more foul-mouthed humor.Alex Vincent makes his last appearence is this film. Brad Dourif also returns, giving a great performance.

151,marccfantozzi,Nothing special.,5,2 November 2021,"Chucky tracks Andy down and continues to stalk him.Sequel is OK but nothing really special. The film's biggest flaw in my opinion is that the film has no likeable characters. The only semi-likeable character is Kyle but actress Christine Elise's performance is nothing special. If anything, she under acts. She just does not seem too phased at the events going on around her. If I was being stalked by a homicidal living doll I would have more emotion. The film's budget is healthy and the special effects are good and the film has an overlong but fun climax. It's just fair.",Child's Play 2

This movie never bores you at any moment and the concept is so different, great idea of making a good looking little doll who doesn't even look evil is made evil.

155,cowboykalira,Far-fetched but fun,6,23 April 2015,"Okay, some people say this movie is a very cheesy sequel to Child's Play, and I can't disagree with them. But in some cases, cheesy is exactly what you want from a movie. Especially if it features a red-haired freckled doll possessed by a serial killer. Come on people, of course this movie was going to be cheesy. The first one just about managed to keep it together with some suspense, but once you've done the big reveal there's not a lot of credible scares you can wring out of this premise. What's left is having fun with it, and Child's Play 2 does that very well. From the opening scene in which Chucky is reconstructed by the original toy factory (for a nonsensical reason, but who cares?), it has this obvious sequel quality to it. The thing that could not be destroyed, but was, is back, and he's angrier than ever! The cliché of the cynical company bosses is played out and then we're on our way. That first scene sets the mood really well, you really get everything you need to get an idea what this movie is going to be like. Over the top, campy, set in its own reality. There really was no other way to go after the over the top ending of Child's Play 1, with the melted, barely recognizable Chucky dragging himself to his victims for a final scare. So we get some enjoyable one-liners from old Chuckles, and I definitely got some chuckles out of his killer lines. Literally, because most of his one-liners are accompanied buy an equally funny kill. About those kills, well, they're maybe not even extremely creative, but they're sure as hell effective. In the beginning of the movie all of the people Chucky kills really deserve to die (in horror-movie terms that is, obviously no one really deserves to die). I'm rooting for Chucky when he kills the underling of the company director who brought old Charles back in the first place and who's just a slimy little weasel. Then Chucky manages to kill Andy's horrible teacher with a ruler, in the classroom where she locked Andy. And even when foster dad Phil is killed on the way to punish little Andy for misbehaving, you're still sort of rooting for the doll. But no horror movie can thrive on just murdering bad guys, so from that point on the movie takes a more action-driven mood, which is done quite nicely. In the end, we go back to real sequel territory when we return to the good guy doll factory for an ultimate showdown, set to a background of thousands of good guy dolls in various stages of being manufactured. That just works brilliantly. The acting in this movie never strays into academy award winner territory, but it's sufficient, and especially little Andy and his stepsister Kyle play their parts pretty well. Of course the real star is Brad Dourif who serves his cheesy lines with a side order of ham. The effects are again nothing mind-blowing (well... one effect is, but that's not a description of its quality, it just literally blows Chucky's mind apart), but they're not bad. Add to that a pretty good score, decent camera work and editing, and you have a nice little brain-snack. I don't think it was anyone's intention to make this a great piece of art. It's pulp, entertainment. Ultimately pointless, but a great watch when you're bored. I can't rate this higher than a 6 objectively, but in my heart I would have given it a 7 or 8, just because it's so unpretentious. Horror sequels that try to artificially invoke the same terror the original had to offer are usually horrible to watch. Child's Play 2, although it is of course nowhere near as good as the first movie, made the right choice to take a different approach.",Child's Play 2

It is shockingly scary and gives you tons of reason to stay for the full movie. Although the end is a bit disappointing, 85-90% of this film is outstanding. One of the best horror films ever made.

Gerrit Graham was well for being the dad, but later broke his neck.I'm not hugely big on chucky but he serves his purpose. One thing I always wanted to know about actor Gerrit Graham is how tall is this handsome actor. I wanted to know how tall he is. So tell me.

One thing was for certain, the world of children's play things would never be the same. Chucky, the killer doll would haunt the dreams and nightmares of children and adults everywhere. His red hair and blue bib would become infamous. His laughs and cackles would become haunting, and his signature vulgar vocabulary would become a siren of terror for all those around!After the success of the first Child's Play Hollywood was ready to cash in on the success and not too late. It would be a year and a half before that good guy that everybody fears would grace the silver screen again to cause terror and mayhem. The sequel to the the terrifying .The script was written by Don Mancini, the writer of the original script and the concept of the films. The main script for the secret was written mainly by Mancini but a small portion of it was written by the director of the sequel John Lafia (Man's Best Friend). The film stars some old faces and some fresh familiars. The main star is Alex Vincent (Cult of Chucky), who played the same character, Andy Barclay, in the first Child's Play. Another cast member is Christine Elise (Body Snatcher's 1993) who plays Andy's loyal friend and companion Kyle. Once again, the great and wonderful Brad Dour if is back as the titular voice of Chucky the doll.The cast also includes some wonderful character actor's. Gerrit Graham (Terror-vision, Phantom of the Paradise) plays Phil Simpson, the jerk- off of the film. Then there is Jenny Agutter (An American Werewolf in London) plays Joanna Simpson, Phil's Wife, who are both foster parents. Next we have Grace Zabriskie (Galaxy of Terror) plays Grace poole, the local orphanage manager. Then we have the real wench of the movie, Andy's 3rd grade teacher, Ms. Kettlewell, play by Beth Grant (Too Wong Foo, Donnie Darko).The film also stars many wonderful practical animatronics by the master of puppets, Kevin Yagher (Tales from the Crypt, A Series of Unfortunate Events). The chucky doll is back and looks better then ever. There are a few new modifications to the look of the doll. The puppetry is amazing and makes the doll seem almost lifelike. The eyes on the doll alone are haunting and ominous. The music was composed by Graeme Revell (Sin City, Pitch Black, The Crow). The Music in the film has that haunting child-like tone that made the first film haunting and creepy. The score is great and bigger in scope compared to the first.The film is very well done and still holds up. The film to me personally is one of the greatest sequels to a film ever. Unlike many sequels to not only great horror films but films in general this sequel works a lot. I love the acting, Its very 90's. Brad Dourif does a wonderful job voicing Chucky. The music within the film is creepy and wonderful. The music is wonderfully composed. Overall, the film works.

165,antonioeku2,Great follow up,8,9 October 2007,"We are now two years removed from the original ""Child's Play"" and entertaining ""Child's Play 2"". Often named one of the best sequels to a film, the premise is of a company trying to renew the popularity of the Good Guy dolls after the poor publicity of Andy Barclay's claims that the doll was killing folk. Why on earth they do this is beyond me but they take the charred remains of the doll possessed by Charles LeRay, scrape off the ashes and burned plastic and send the dolls back into production using the Chucky dolls their prototype.So Chucky escapes the clutches of the toy makers and works on finding Andy because Andy was the first person he told his secret to...and that means in voodoo world that he is the only one that Charles can put his soul into. Meanwhile, Andy is put with a foster family and has actually learned to be friendly with a new Good Guy Doll. Easy pickings and Chucky does away with Andy's new doll and moves in for the kill. So Andy discovers Chucky is back soon enough and once again...nobody believes him. So we get a much more action packed movie with Chucky on the prowl once again and Andy fleeing him all the while. The film ends up for an excellent finale in the toy factory that isn't to be missed. Classic scene from this film is Chucky's use of the middle finger from the back of a big rig with Kyle (Christine Elise) in pursuit. I've always gotten a kick out of that.

Child Play, starring the good guy doll, Chucky, who has the soul of a killer stuck in him, is what makes it original and very scary! Not only that, but the doll seems alive! When your here a Sequel is being made, not many people have high expectations, however, this one blew away the series, and was a big improvement to the first! Yes, the first was Scary, but this just rules it. First, characters are better and interesting. Second, gore is up, making it even more horrible, third, comedy to the increase, everyone loves black humor, and second, better storyline setting!In my opinion, this movie was very good.In this movie, our young star from the first reprises his role as the innocent boy, who has been terrorized by Chucky. His mother has been sent to a Mental Instatutoin, and the boy is adopted. His loving parents give him a Chucky doll...and the mayhem starts.

Also I like the fact,that Chucky went after Andy again<compared to the dumb story in number 3>. If you think about it, Andy <played by Alex Vincent>,and the voice of Chucky<Brad Dourif> were the only ones that came back from the original. Oh,well, I felt Andy was the strongest characther ever in the series,going to through so much,at such a young age,and able to fight back is really cool. I wish Alex Vincent was still acting.

I hadn't had the desire to rewatch it, or buy it. That said, I did still have a slight interest in seeing this one. Today, I finally did...and I'm really glad I did. I found this one more entertaining than the first one in every way. The movie flew by, and every scene I was intrigued to see where it was going. I found myself very invested in Andy's character, and seeing how he deals with the aftermath of the first one. I also found Kyle to be a really likeable, older sister type character. Between Chucky's one liners, the atmosphere, the pacing, and the acting, I was hooked. Not to mention the finale has an awesome setting.

All of my friends had said it was sooo scary. When I saw it I sort of got a feeling of: that was ok. It is not the worst horror movie I have sat through and its not really that bad. What I liked was the special effects,and the awesome climax at the Good Guy factory . What I didnt like was the fact that the film seemed to be recyciling itself as it went along. There were too many moments where the actors were looking for chucky, when he pops out suddenly and stabs them with a knife or somthing. Also The acting seemed so stale, like every one just wanted to stop making the film as soon as they could. It is far better than number 3, but is that saying much?

It's comedic but still scary, it feels like there are legitimate stakes (especially at the end!), I legitimately cared for Kyle in particular as she wasn't sure to live being a side character, the kills were incredible and there were lots of them, this was a super fun watch.
I found the ""adults not believing Andy"" thing pretty annoying after a while, though.
Plus the only character seen who's even remotely of color is supposed to be seen as a hindrance to the task of saving Andy.
Very good. 8/10.",Child's Play 2
173,mamaeileencrawford,Slasher Sequel Done Right,10,28 March 2019,"Child's Play was a surprise hit back in '88 and it made sense to bring the devilish Chucky back for another round. Whereas most sequels would throw out all the characters from the original and find some way for Chucky to terrorize a fresh batch of victims, Child's Play 2 keeps its young hero, Andy, and follows him as he struggles to get acclimated to his new foster home after his mother has been committed to a mental hospital for telling everyone that they were attacked by a killer doll.This is a nice touch that separates Child's Play 2 from similar slasher cash grabs by actually still keeping an active interest in its hero's life. It also helps that writer, Don Mancini, has brought in an equally interesting heroine named Kyle who's a tough, sarcastic teenage foster kid in the same home with Andy. As played by Christine Elise, Kyle is a memorable and worthy buddy for Andy and you really root for them to stay out of danger.The effects are even better this time around and there are quite a few nail biting suspense sequences including a harrowing final act in a doll factory. It's shockingly clever and always a blast.Thanks to a strong script and cast, Child's Play 2 stands out from other slasher sequels as a rare case of a sequel being better than the original. Definitely worth checking out.",Child's Play 2
174,Chrisgill15,This film proves sequels can be better than the original!,10,16 April 2021,I grew up with this film and it seemed like it was always the one people talked about. I recently rewatched the original child's play movie and I did enjoy it but I found that child's play 2 has a far better story and overall just a more entertaining entry in the franchise. I don't understand why this one has a lesser rating but I'm giving this one a 10/10.,Child's Play 2
175,johnswitchblade1234,a Great Follow-up... but with some corny effects,7,26 August 2011,"OK Child's Play 2 is a great follow-up to the original, but there's one flaw CORNY EFFECTS! the first one had great, realistic effects now this sequel's effects are a COMPLETE JOKE! oh well it has a few good effects, and it's still lives up to the original film. The closing sequence is frightening also at the Play Pals Toy Company. Alex Vincent plays great as Andy in this one, and Christine Elise is great as Kyle.7 out of 10Child's Play 2 is a fast paced thriller that lives up to it's 1988 predecessor - John Bartus",Child's Play 2

177,lucaspd-99044,A sequel to a horror movie definitely better than its predecessor,7,18 August 2017,"We have here a continuation of horror film that manages to be superior to its predecessor. Again, the highlight of the film is production, photography, visual effects, art direction, locations and scenarios, everything again is of an absurd and even better quality than the first film. And again without a doubt, the voice work of Brad Dourif is a spectacle to the part. The film may not have the most original story of the movie but it manages to be more energetic and tense than the first film, just because an adopted child occupies the position of protagonist of the film, which makes things reasonably more tense, And also mentioning the performance of Alex Vincent who also steals the scene for him. The director here seems much more inspired by the film, all the directing work is far superior to the first film. But we still have some problems, the supporting cast remains weak, we have some nonsense scenes and also the ridiculous attempt to make the film take itself seriously, but here we have some black humor. I emphasized the positive aspects of the film because it is much better than the previous one and because I did not like it very much, my expectations were very low, but it is a predictable film, definitely forgettable and narratives relapsed.",Child's Play 2

This is just the same, thats why its so good. Chucky, once again tries to transform his soul into Andy, his ex owner. This film is brilliant. Although the ending isn't quite as good as the first. Avoid the third, at all costs. A real treat for all Childs Play lovers, Chucky remains the horrific, gory doll that he has always been!",Child's Play 2

184,wutdafxupwitdat123,Another blooper for Chucky 2! and my thoughts on it.,10,7 August 2007,Another blooper that they missed was when Kyle was going through the machine where they put the eyes in the good guy dolls she gasps and goes back and when it comes down it puts eyes in a good guy but on the shot before you can clearly see that there was no doll in front of her to put eyes in. My thoughts on this movie are good. The movie graphics were excellent for 1990 and a great sequel to the awesome Child's Play movie in 1988. Chucky is basically brought back to life by the company. Even though I loved this movie why would they want to rebuild that one doll that could just be out of there lives forever that almost ruined the company when they have tons of dolls already made? It doesn't make much sense when you think about it.,Child's Play 2
185,psyenergy,Better than the first but same storyline,7,8 July 2012,"Childs play 2 is scarier, much faster paced, much much more gore and my favourite out of the whole franchise. I have to be honest though this movie has the exact same storyline as the first film, just a different setting and different characters.Its Chucky going out to find the little boy Andy (who is now older and slightly smarter) to steal his soul. Which is the same as its original film, despite this its much better than first in almost every way.Acterly Childs play 2 wouldn't be a bad remake but its probably much better as a sequel. Its not perfect at all it has many flaws but its a damn good horror film and if you liked the first one you will love this. 7/10",Child's Play 2
186,Pearljam109,"Eh, just eh",5,11 December 2011,"When I first saw child's play, I was 10 years old, and I loved it! It was the first horror film I had ever seen which considering 70% of my movie collection are horror movies, it's fair to say it changed me as a movie goer. But when I saw Child's play 2 I think I had the same reaction that any horror fan did, ""Eh, just eh"". In order to do this movie justice I feel I should write a positive paragraph and a negative paragraph.What's good is that it's a classic bad horror film. There are some classic deaths and some clever lines. It's nice to see Alex Vincent return as Andy Barclay, but my favorite casting call is bringing back Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky. It has a half decent story and it wraps together quite well. The best part is the carnival music at the end.Now for what's bad. It's not as good as the first, by a lot. While this one was a classic bad horror film, the original was a classic good horror film. The voodoo aspect, besides the chant, has been annihilated and otherwise written out of the story. Brad Dourif and Alex Vincent are back but Chris Sarandon (Mike Norris) and Catherine Hicks (Karen Barclay) are no where to be found, and those were my favorite characters! So bottom line, this movie is pretty bad, but hey, it's better than what the producers did to chucky in the OTHER sequels.",Child's Play 2
187,scandinavianairlinestw,An important mark for the series,10,6 October 2019,"Here's my review on Child's Play 2 (1990).When reviewing this title, I think of the following: What makes a worthy horror sequel? Does having a more dramatic feel make your movie more successful? I believe yes and yes.While the first movie succeeds with interesting suspense, Child's Play 2 benefits from having the killer doll Chucky get down to business towards the beginning of the film. Child's Play 2 also includes more emotional depth between the characters, and is a bit more funny than the first film (for better or worse).Once again, we have great acting skills by popular actors at the time, and Alex Vincent possesses a performance that would make me want to watch this movie again. In an era where most horror sequels were getting embarrassing, Child's Play 2 surprises me that it is continuing the plot of the first film, yet still making it interesting and creepy enough. If the film is actually scary though, is up to you, reader.Child's Play 2 seems to have a more open tone than the original Child's Play as well, and I feel more open to a horror film with great aesthetic all around, rather than being trapped in darkness for the whole movie. The relationship between Kyle and Andy is heartwarming to me, and it helps the movie feel more real in a time were relationships between those types of siblings wasn't very common.So, all in all, I won't directly say Child's Play 2 is better than the first film, or that it is the best horror film in general, so I won't. Still, I find it to be a very high mark in the series, despite the continued story line.",Child's Play 2
188,christopher_1991,i don't like child's play 2 the plot was gone not good for a sequel,2,28 June 2007,I am a really big fan of horror films I've seen Texas chainsaw Halloween you name it I've seen it. My favourite is child's play 1 saw the the 1st chuck film when i was 9 and i loved it. I recommend who ever reads this go and see child's play 1 but you have to buy it because it is banned and its rare to get hold of in hired shops especial in england. If you want to know why its banned look it up. Childs play 2 is good if you see the 1st one you can compare it but after you see the first one you will notice that don Mancini has mucked the story line up. I notice that because he didn't explain nothing at all about it he changed everything the main characters from the 1st one should have been in the second one. he should have changed the 2nd story line into the the 3rd one and come up with something explaining what happened to Andy's mum. I recommend after seeing the 1st chuck don't see the rest up to you but if you see the last 4 you will find that the plot as gone you will get really confused about what happened to the main characters. Plus after seeing the last 4 you will find they are boring I recommend to just see the 1st child's play because the 1st was superb,Child's Play 2

I mean what 15 year old would like to see a doll having a knife for a hand after losing theirs. Also if anyone has seen the poster for the film I believe it should have been banned. Chucky is holding a pair of scissors threatening to cut a jack-in-the-box's head off. Honestly, what is that poster promoting. Why in the world would Universal Pictures agree on distrobuting a disturbing horror film. I know them for better film such as The Flintstones, The Nutty Professor, Jurassic Park, Beethoven, An American Tail, E.T etc. So parents please do not let your children watch Child's Play 2",Child's Play 2

194,dimitri_alexandr,A Burton-esque horror film,7,21 June 2012,"Charles ""Chucky"" Lee Ray, our favorite little profane puppet, is back for more murderous mayhem and to hunt down his nemesis Andy Barclay (and his little soul too!) in this, the second of the increasingly bizarre ""Child's Play"" films.'Child's Play 2' is in no way a bad movie, however, as Ebert pointed out in his review, you are likely to walk away from it feeling conflicted. For a film only 84 minutes long, it really packs quite a punch. The plot itself isn't all too impressive, however the film's impact lies in its execution.Stefan Czapsky's photography is effectively claustrophobic, and makes great use of an elaborate, eye-poppingly colorful set design to make the film look painfully cheerful and eerie. Graeme Revell's score is difficult to describe. It is a good score, however, coming off of Joe Renzetti's creepy electronic score for the previous film, this frenzied, overwrought orchestra is more in the vein of Christopher Young's 'Hellraiser' scores and would be better suited for a film of that series as opposed to 'Chucky'. It is, at times, overtly sinister.These, combined with John Lafia's over-the-top directing style make for an action-packed, visually pleasing, and profoundly uncomfortable viewing experience. It feels like the movie was made with the direct intention of frightening children out of their wits. Or like Tim Burton attempting a horror movie.",Child's Play 2
195,chrisdewey,An entertaining movie that can't live up to the original,6,10 January 2007,"In Child's Play 2 we see the return of Chucky, a doll possessed by the soul of Chicago killer Charles Lee Ray (Dourif). It seems that after the first installment of the series, Chucky's potential victim, Andy (Vincent) was placed temporarily into an orphanage while his mother underwent psychiatric evaluation. We learn that police witnesses involved in the first film decided not to press charges against Good Guy Dolls, the company responsible for the manufacturing of toys like Chucky. However, the executives at Good Guy are up in arms over negative tabloid reports and have reassembled Chucky to study it. One thing leads to another, Chucky escapes and goes to find Andy, the one person whose body he can cast himself into by the use of voodoo.Ahh, a time where the Child's Play series was still trying to be scary. I can remember watching Child's Play 2 late at night on USA at a young impressionable age, something which my parents would have prohibited if they had known how determined I was to watch scary movies. Although the movie doesn't do much to frighten me now, this flick scared the crap out of me back then. Chucky becomes much more of a featured character in this sequel. Unlike the first film which opted to keep Chucky in the shadows for most of the first half, we see the character interacting in the environment. While this lessens any tension or mystery about Chucky, it gives Brad Dourif the chance to talk more and spit out continuous one-liners and obscenities. Without Dourif, this movie would have lost major points with me.The special effects in Child's Play 2 are one area in which the production crew topped the original. Especially considering the time in which it was made, it is amazing how they were able to show Chucky walking around and interacting so freely with the environment. His movements are very smooth and realistic. After a while, it is easy to forget that there is even a special effects crew operating the doll.Although movies like this have a reputation for sub par acting, there are actually a few fine performances in Child's Play 2 that stand out. Alex Vincent continues to be effective as Andy Barclay. He comes off very real and avoids any child star overacting, known in my book as Jake Lloydisms. Unfortunately, this time his role doesn't require him to do much more than look concerned, nervous, and sometimes scared. I felt he was much more developed and explored in the original. Also, Jenny Agutter, of An American Werewolf in London fame, gives a strong performance as a caring foster mother.Nevertheless, there is some lousy acting here. While Christine Elise is not bad as Andy's foster sister Kyle, her reactions and overall display of emotion are pretty flat. I mean, the girl doesn't seem to be too blown away by the fact that there is a killer doll trying to kill her. In a scene where Chucky commands her to drive faster, she casually asks him with mild annoyance ""what his hurry is?"" I had the same issue with the Good Guy exec that Chucky holds up in the beginning. This is a talking, walking, killing doll that houses the spirit of a dead criminal! Why does this fail to amaze you? Ultimately, this movie fails to live up to the expectations that the original instilled in audiences. Whereas the first movie played like a supernatural crime thriller, Child's Play 2 feels comfortable with settling into pre-existing slasher clichés. The simplistic plot leaves much to be desired. Chucky escapes, finds Andy, causes trouble which gets blamed on Andy, kills some characters which have death written boldly in red on their forehead, and isolates the obvious survivor(s) in a showdown. It's a progression that can be predicted well before viewing. There is also the ever predictable stalk sequence where the protagonist is looking for Chucky, the music is builds to a crescendo, he pulls something aside expecting to see the doll right as the music climaxes, he sees nothing, sighs in a relief to make the audience think he's not there, and then crazy old Chucky dives out from another spot, in effect causing the music to soar to new heights.Also, why are there so many characters that seem out to get Andy? The foster father (Graham) seems only moderately sorry for leaving a Good Guy doll in his adoptive son's closest, even when he knows about Andy's history with the company. OK, I guess we can let that one slip. But does remove the doll from the house? No! Like a jackass, he decides that he can break Andy's ""irrational"" fear of the doll by keeping it around the house. Also, the teacher irked me. What kind of person teaches a first grade class like that? I particularly enjoyed the part where she keeps Andy after for detention, something that usually isn't bestowed on children that young. If that wasn't bad enough, she proceeds to lock Andy in the classroom with Chucky while she calls his house. I realize that the actions of these characters exist to advance the plot, but couldn't they have made the characters better-rounded and less static? But all in all, Child's Play 2 isn't a bad movie. It's not great, it doesn't top the original, but it is entertaining as hell. Sure this film had about as many false endings as Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, but that seems to be a Chucky tradition. If you are older than fifteen, don't expect to be scared too much. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a light-hearted horror movie with dark humor, you can't go wrong. Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky alone justifies the price of the DVD purchase or rental.",Child's Play 2
