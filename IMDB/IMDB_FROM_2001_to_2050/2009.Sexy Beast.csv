0,TheLittleSongbird,A beast of a film,8,6 September 2017,"With a cast like Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, Amanda Redman and Ben Kingsley there was the thought that 'Sexy Beast' should be a really good film and couldn't go wrong.'Sexy Beast' lives up to its potential as a really good film, and rarely puts a foot wrong. While it may not quite one's definition of sexy, it is certainly a beast and a fine one at that. This is much more than a ""Ray Winstone gangster film"" as it deceivingly appears on the surface. Instead it is a neat, tense crime thriller that pulls no punches and doesn't hold back, scarily so in fact. While there is a lot to recommend in 'Sexy Beast', it is the performances that carry the film and what makes it as good as it is.Ray Winstone has seldom been more restrained and wisely so, while Ian McShane is creepy in an understated way, Amanda Redman is sensual and fiery and James Fox is solid. Stealing the film is Ben Kingsley who has never been more supremely terrifying than here, making for one of the most unforgettable screen psychos, anybody who knows him best from his gentler roles like Gandhi will still love him in those roles but not see them in the same way again.That the characterisation is meaty, particularly the juicy one for Logan (a dream part for anybody wanting to do something different to usual), and that the material is good helps, but it is more to do with that the cast are strong enough actors to do justice to it.Jonathan Glazer, in his film debut after his background in television adverts, brings slick tension and an audacious visual style to his directing. Visually, 'Sexy Beast' is bold, stylish and colourful, with the idyllic scenery contrasting wonderfully with the tension of the story. The music is suitably pulsating.'Sexy Beast's' script, in a dialogue-driven film, positively blisters and the intense brutality of a lot of it makes the most foul-mouthed Quentin Tarantino films family friendly in comparison. The story, while structurally slight, delivers on the suspense and tension and intrigues, particularly in the riveting confrontational chemistry between Winstone and Kingsley (the former in a way playing second fiddle to the latter).It's not a perfect film by all means. The tension and pacing slackens slightly in the later stages of the film and, although clever and slickly done, the caper subplot gets a little improbable towards being wrapped up.Otherwise, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Sexy Beast
1,Leofwine_draca,Why is that goat staring at me?,7,6 May 2011,"A small-scale heist thriller in which the heist itself comes across as secondary to the film's main interest and rather redundant by the time it happens. The main interest is, of course, a barnstorming performance from Sir Ben Kingsley as one absolutely dangerous, over-the-edge gangster. Kingsley is superb here and makes for one of the funniest, most chilling characters of all time. The dialogue hums and zings while even at the same time the plotting is nothing more than predictable.It's hardly worth bothering with the other characters, although Ray Winstone holds it all together as a likable enough retired gangster type. Ian McShane's around too, but wasted in a minor role and really it's the interaction between Kingsley and the rest of the cast you'll be watching: as outrageous, profane, insane and genuinely funny as any other film I can think of.",Sexy Beast
2,SnoopyStyle,crazy stylish absurdist heist movie,7,11 May 2014,"Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is living the retired life in Spain with his wife Deedee (Amanda Redman) and their friends when former fellow criminal and abusive sociopath Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) crashes in. He wants Gal to do a bank heist back in London, but Gal resists. There is a big confrontation with Logan and the group. Gal is forced to do the job for Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) as if nothing happened. Teddy got information on the safe from the manager Harry (James Fox) and everybody is on edge.Director Jonathan Glazer has a great absurd style which he uses on idiosyncratic characters. Ben Kingsley's intensity is great. It's too bad that he has to be killed off. I love the fact that everybody is afraid of him before he even arrives. His dialog is absolutely crazy. Ray Winstone went beach bum blonde. The story is a little light in the first half but that has the fun of Ben Kingsley. The second half gets weird with Gal's crazy visions and overall sense of paranoia.",Sexy Beast
3,Prismark10,A house of villains,7,10 October 2014,"Much is talked about Ben Kingsley's casting as thuggish gangster Don Logan that people forget the other actors with roots in crime or gangster films.James Fox played ruthless Chas in Performance, Ian McShane appeared in Villain and Dirty Money and Ray Winstone has been playing villains of some sort since he was teenager such as films like Scum.Winstone plays Gal a retired safe-cracker living out in Spain with his wife and other ex-con friends. However it seems he is being lured out of retirement by Logan which causes fear amongst the group and soon Logan turns up in Spain to personally request that Gal comes to London and he is not a person you say no to. There begins a cat and mouse game and you see that Logan is unhinged switching from being friendly to explosive with sudden surges of violence.Winstone actually plays the nicest guy in the film, he just wants a quiet life with his wife and his pot of stolen loot. Kingsley, that nice Gandhi bloke strips him psychologically with threats, actual and implied, his wife's past as a porn star.The film is strong on language, it does suffer a bit too much with it at times as every other word is peppered with it. There is dark humour although the film does not take the path of comedy cockney villains that some British gangster films like to do. It relies on performances, Winstone underplays enough to let Kingsley shine in his supporting role, a part which took many by surprise because he does not play those roles.",Sexy Beast
4,lee_eisenberg,criminy,4,19 February 2012,"OK, I've liked Ben Kingsley, Ray Winstone and Ian McShane in most of the movies in which I've seen them, but Jonathan Glazer's ""Sexy Beast"" is too weird. There have been so many retired-criminals-go-in-for-one-last-shot movies that they've become a blur. I will admit that ""Sexy Beast"" has some neat scenes -- namely the boulder -- but I didn't like it otherwise. I guess that I'd taken to Guy Ritchie's movies so much that I preferred for crime-themed movies to have a very comedic tone. You might like this movie, especially Kingsley's sociopathic thug (a totally different role from Gandhi), but I didn't find anything appealing about the movie. Could someone please explain what that thing that looked like a monster was supposed to be?",Sexy Beast
5,jboothmillard,Sexy Beast,7,16 March 2008,"I had heard about this film a coupe of times, and seen one or two clips, so I had to at least try it. Obviously I recognised the opening sequence, where a boulder is rolling down the hill, and close to hitting the lead character. Anyway, basically Gary 'Gal' Dove (Ray Winstone) is the retired gangster living a happy life in the beautiful house and surrounding of Spain, with his wife Deedee (Amanda Redman). Soon this peacefulness is to be put on hold by the sudden arrival of respected mob name, and Gal's old ""friend"" Don 'Malky' Logan (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Ben Kingsley). He wants Gal to join him on a big strike in London with a well picked out gang of respected gangsters. Gal obviously keeps turning him down, and Don gets more and more threatening trying to ""persuade"" him, no isn't the answer he wants. Gal eventually accepts this final mission, but without Don, and in a few flashes back to Spain, you find out why he is trying to cover up the death of Don. Oh, the title by the way relates to some dreams Gal has of a hairy beast in a cave. Also starring Ian McShane as Teddy Bass, Cavan Kendall as Aitch, Julianne White as Jackie and James Fox as Harry. To be honest, Winstone was a bit quiet and not as aggressive or swearing (his use of the ""c"" word usually most common) as usual, the whole reason to see this film in my opinion is Kinglsey. It was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film. Ray Winstone was number 32, and Sir Ben Kingsley number 16 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 34 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 5 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Sexy Beast
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Beastly Stuff, And Utterly Fascinatng",10,4 November 2006,"At first, I thought this was just a poor man's ""Snatch,"" with the wild cinematography, dark humor, brutal characters and language....but not as good as that more well-known film. Well, I have really begun to like this film a lot, equally, if not more, than ""Snatch.""The more I see ""Sexy Beast,"" the more fascinating it gets, and it was pretty interesting the first time! And, at less than an hour-and-a-half it's even more watchable. It also is a good idea to play this with the English subtitles on, unless you can understand the strong British accents, and can interpret the slang words.Ben Kingsley, as sociopath ""Don Logan,"" is unbelievably intense and almost has my jaw dropping when watching him in here. ""Intense"" doesn't even begin describing this guy. Ian McShane is another creepy guy in here as ""Teddy."" These two guys make the lead characters, two couples, look normal. Those four are retired crooks and their wives, now living the easy life in Spain. Easy, that is, until Logan arrives and wants one of them for another job. The retiree wants to stay that way but Logan is not a man who takes ""no"" for an answer.This is one movie you will not forget. Warning: it's rough, crude and strange. Expect a lot of ""f"" words and ""c"" words. Also expect an interesting 89 minutes.",Sexy Beast
7,Tweekums,You don't say no to Ben Kingsley,9,1 April 2019,"Gary Dove is a London gangster who has retired to Spain where he lives in a villa with his wife Deedee; he spends his days lying by the pool or hanging out with friends Aitch and Jackie... things couldn't be better. Then one day Don Logan calls; he is a far from retired gangster and he expects Gary to return to London to work on a safety deposit box raid; Don isn't the sort of person to take no for an answer.Too many British gangster films try to make it out to be glamourous with swaggering villains talking in slang that is almost their own language... this is somewhat different and much better. Retired villains Gary and Aitch aren't glamourous; they got enough money to comfortably retire without being stinking rich. Similarly they aren't particularly menacing; unlike Don Logan who is terrifying... a foul mouthed psychopath with a hair-trigger temper. The story plays out nicely; the opening scenes introduce Gary, his wife and their friends as well as providing some good laughs. Don's arrival immediately raises the tension and some time is spent on Gary trying to decline his invitation to do the job. Don's description of how he came to be involved introduces other key players in the planned robbery. As the end approached I genuinely had no idea how things would work out for Gary. The cast does an impressive job; Ray Winstone is on top form as Gary but Ben Kingsley manages to steal every scene he is in; he makes Don one of the scariest villains on screen. The quantity of swearing may be too much for some viewers but if it doesn't bother you and you are looking for a great gangster film I'd heartily recommend this.",Sexy Beast
8,BA_Harrison,Fan-dabby-dozy-tastic.,9,15 December 2012,"Don't do the same as me and mistake this for just another Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels: although the film features exaggerated Cockney characters, sharp dialogue, snappy direction, and the occasional brutal outburst of violence, its unique pace, offbeat style and surreal asides (that rabbit demon is bloody freaky!) make it a far sexier beast than anything Guy Ritchie has to offer.Surprisingly, for much of its running time, the film is an intense character study, one that relies on talk over action; well over half the film passes without a gunshot fired or punch thrown, but it is riveting stuff nonetheless. This is largely thanks to flawless performances by its superb cast (not least from Ben Kingsley as psychopath Don Logan, who steals virtually every scene he is in with his utterly menacing manner and ripe discourse), although the film also benefits immensely from director Jonathan Glazer's bold aesthetic, his imagery as colourful as his characters' language and as striking as Deedee's eyes.",Sexy Beast
9,Quinoa1984,One of the most stylish and yet flawed british crime films I've seen,9,1 July 2001,"Sexy Beast has a paradox about it.  It is often confusing and doesn't make much sense (in parts I mean, the main plot is clear), plus sometimes the dialoge is unclear, and from someone who thinks Trainspotting with dialoge that needs subtitles is a smash, that's a lot to say.Anyway though, the film, does have some really good points to it, including more style than most films you will see this summer.  And, the acting is fantastic with Kinglsey in one of his best and most ferocious roles to date. Plus, this is the only movie I will ever see a under-water bank robbing scene.  B+",Sexy Beast
10,hitchcockthelegend,But quite frankly your attitude appalls me. It's not what you're saying. It's all this stuff you're not saying. Insinnuendos.,8,4 June 2015,"Sexy Beast is directed by Jonathan Glazer and written by Louis Mellis and David Scinto. It stars Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane, Amanda Redman, Cavan Kendall, James Fox and Julianne White. Music is by Roque Baños and cinematography by Ivan Bird.Retired to the Costa del Chill Out, retired thief Gary 'Gal' Dove (Winstone) finds his tranquil existence shattered when menacing gangster Don Logan (Kingsley) arrives on the scene demanding Gal goes back to London to do another job.2000 saw a slew of British gangster films released. The success of ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" opened the door for film makers keen to do their bit for Brit Grit. As is always the way, quality varies, but the class of 2000 had a healthy rate of good 'uns, of which Sexy Beast is a proud operator.The story is very thin, very film noir, an ex bad boy doing one last job that risks everything he has settled down for, but there's a panache to how the makers construct the tale. It helps that it's boosted by a ferocious performance from Kingsley, who is given licence to unleash his dark half, as he swears, stares, gets violent and has a general disregard for anyone but himself.Director Glazer, in what was his film after breaking out from advertisements and music videos, shows a keen eye for stylist visuals and attention grabbing scenes. He opens with an outrageous sequence of Gal sun bathing by his pool, the sun burning down, and then a giant boulder thunders into view and lands in the pool! All set to the sound of ""The Stranglers"" single ""Peaches"". Quite a way to announce yourself in film.The first half of film is the best, set at Gal's Spanish villa, Glazer neatly frames the characters (Gal lives with his wife and his two friends from England live nearby) as they bicker and cower in the shadow of Logan, who wouldn't be beyond sending them all to hell if he doesn't get his way. It's sweaty and tense, a coiled spring like atmosphere tells us something is going to give - and it does. The second half of the piece is not so tense or thrilling, though the robbery has a whiff of genius about it, but the pay off works well because Gal has earned our respect, as has his fellow sun seekers. Sexy Beast is not just sexy (tongue in cheeks for the makers), it's beefy and brutal, but also strangely beautiful as well. Nice. 8/10",Sexy Beast
11,Theo Robertson,Too Strange For My Taste,6,30 March 2003,"I first thing I noticed about SEXY BEAST was that Ray Winstone`s character is called Gal . I actually know someone called Gal in real life , she`s an Israeli so I wondered why the anti hero in this film has an Israeli girls name when he`s a bloke from London ! I was futher confused why SEXY BEAST has several surreal sequences like a demon tooled up with an uzi approaching Gal`s dinner table . No doubt more pretentious reviewers will discuss the meaning behind these scenes but that`s not really the point - the scenes are distracting and don`t add anything . But my abiding memory of SEXY BEAST is the character interaction between Gal and Don Logan , it`s like something out of THE FAST SHOW , can`t you just imagine Simon Day or Paul Whitehouse playing a retired gangster working in a hotel as a waiter ? "" Tea or coffee you f***in` c*** , the continental or english breakfast you f***in` c*** , cash or cheque you f***in` c*** , I f***ed your wife you f***in` c***
It does have its good points though . Winstone is a fairly limited actor but he`s made a career out of playing rough diamond geezers something he excels at . Ben Kingsley is excellent as Logan , a role for which he received an Oscar nod , but perhaps the best performance - Certainly the most understated - is Ian McShane as Teddy Bass .But for the most part I found SEXY BEAST ( Why`s the film called that ?) to be disappointing . Maybe I was expecting something like ESSEX BOYS or THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY with a Spanish setting , but what I got was something similar to PERFORMANCE",Sexy Beast
12,LeonLouisRicci,Foul-Mouthed Film with Outstanding Performances and a Sizzling Style,8,25 November 2014,"This is an Odd Film with an Even Odder Title. A British Gangster Movie that is One of Their Best. Heavy Accents Aside, it is Refreshing, and Hard-Boiled with Steaming Streaming Dialog and a Black-Comedy Edge with Profane Pronouncements and a Sizzling Performance by Ben Kingsley and the Other Cast Members do Great Work, Especially Ray Winstone and Ian McShane.It has Style to Burn and is a Clever Composite of Character Dimension that is Slightly Unusual. There is a Sweet Side to it All as with the Unconditional Love Between the Ex-Gangster and the Ex-Porn Star.Glitzy and Glamorous, the Film is Offbeat and Offensive to Sensitive Types but it Cannot be Denied the Impact it has had on Fans and Critics Alike. It's Foul Mouth May Turn Off Some but the Dialog is Delivered in a Surreal Fashion with Echoes of Impromptu.Overall, it is a Film that can be Divisive but is Gritty Enough and Different Enough (from the goofy Guy Ritchie Movies) to be Recommended for Fans of Neo-Noir and Character Studies.

13,Bunuel1976,"SEXY BEAST (Jonathan Glazer, 2000) **1/2",6,10 November 2006,"Despite the accolades this one has received, I wasn't all that impressed with it: for a gangster film, there's little action (though the underwater robbery was certainly a novel idea) - the rest is mere posturing (a common factor with modern British efforts in the genre...but I did like its injections of surrealism!) and endless talk (a lot of which is unintelligible anyway, due to the heavy accents and the overwhelming soundtrack)!! Performances are mannered - Oscar-nominated Ben Kingsley above all - making the characters insufferable rather than tough or scary! It's watchable, well enough made (i.e. not overdone - being former music-video director Glazer's debut feature) and mercifully short.",Sexy Beast
14,view_and_review,A Cool 60 Degrees,5,28 January 2021,"""Sexy Beast"" is not about anything that your mind would automatically conjure up. It's possible you may think the main character is a sexy beast, but it's far from a guarantee.No, mate, this movie was about a bully attempting to badger an ex-thief into doing ""one more job."" The bully, Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), was downright childish with his petulance. He would not take no for an answer and his antics would've been comical if they weren't so annoying. He hurled insults, he kicked, he screamed, he intimidated; all like a puffed-up gorilla. He was a pathetic bloke.The ex-thief, Gal (Ray Winstone), continued to politely, quietly, and sheepishly hold his ground. He had a new life now and he was retired. It helped that his significant other Deedee Dove (Amanda Redman) was a bug in his ear (the standard female moral compass role).The job to be done was secondary in this movie because it was all about the clash between Don and Gal (and Gal's friends). Don's barking and everyone else's kowtowing went on for so long that even if Gal relented the job would be anticlimactic.""Sexy Beast"" didn't offer enough. The characters were uninteresting as was the plot. The movie was easy enough to watch, except when I was straining to understand some of the dialog. On the temperature gauge this movie was a cool 60 degrees (that would be Fahrenheit), not the least bit hot, but not so cold it's unbearable.",Sexy Beast
15,neil-476,Nasty. Good.,8,25 April 2011,"My family had an interesting experience over several years, when one family member was married to an individual who could - and did - lie with an absolutely straight face. More exactly, everything this person said and did was determined by how effectively it would suit their purposes, not by how true or right it was. It is not until you have encountered such a person at first hand that you understand how unsettling it is to encounter someone who has a complete disregard for the effects of their actions on other people.If you watch Sexy Beast, it may give you some idea.Ben Kingsley's Don is a monster. He has no fear and is capable of such acts that the mere mention of his name terrifies those who know him.The other performances are all good: Kingsley mesmerises.Incidentally, the cockney accents here aren't especially difficult to understand: certainly no more difficult than some regional US accents.

But he's up against Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the mob boss who gives him his orders, and Kingsley tears into the material like a junkyard dog. Trust me -- this performance will wipe away memories of his gentle, benevolent portrayal of Gandhi.""Sexy Beast"" is the kind of tawdry, well-crafted little B movie that falls through the cracks and is discovered on DVD or cable.

17,FlashCallahan,Why are you swearing? I'm not swearing....,10,3 February 2011,"Gal, a retired gangster, lives a happy life with his wife Deedee in a beautiful house in Spain.Don Logan, a respected name with the mob and an old ""friend"" to Gal, suddenly shows up. He wants Gal to join him on this big strike in London together with a well picked out gang of respected gangsters.When Gal keeps turning him down, Don gets more and more threatening, no is not an answer...After a few sophomore years of mockney gangster movie rip offs, we finally get a classic crime/drama that gives us Ben Kingsleys greatest role ever.As Don Logan, he is the epitaph of gruesome, someone who exudes aggression and can change an atmosphere as soon as he walks into a room. Kingsley can do this with Don without uttering a word, and the fact that he is obviously mentally ill makes him scarier and strangely, quite amusing.But this isn't just a film about a robbery, This is about the past catching up with Gal, and his life not as 'rosy' as he expects (see the boulder falling down at the beginning, indicating a disturbance on the way, and him not forgetting about the past or his time in prison (which could be an indication for the goat).The film is almost comic book in it's character study, it's strange to say that a lot of characters are two dimensional, but the central performances bring them out more. Spain is depicted beautifully, and makes you want to live Gals life. It doesn't help that London is raining or appears to be cold the majority of the time.All in all, this is about being unable to run away from the past, no matter how much you have or how far you go. If someone is jealous of you, some will go to great lengths to ruin your happiness.A truly amazing British film.",Sexy Beast
18,The_Void,Great British crime highlight!,9,30 September 2004,"Sexy Beast is a film about Gal Dove (Ray Winstone), an aging crook that has retired to a villa in Spain. However, as we know; crime doesn't pay, and had he have been left in Spain to live happily ever after, his life of crime would have paid off big time, but, much to his dismay, he gets pulled back in for another job. From the moment this film begins - with a great sequence involving Ray Winstone nearly being squashed by a falling rock, to the tune of The Strangler's ""Peaches"", it is obvious to the viewer that they are indeed in for a treat. This is a simply brilliant opener, one that is not only funny but also one that sets the right tone for the movie. The movie looks beautiful, mostly owing to the luscious Spanish villa that our hero lives in. Setting the movie in Spain was a great idea; it allows for a very different tone to the majority of other crime thrillers that go for a more dark, seedy look to the film. Another highlight of Sexy Beast is it's script; the script is a big issue these days, with films like Pulp fiction making snappy dialogue cool, and the one here doesn't disappoint. It's witty and it creates the characters in equal measure; and that's the mark of a great script, one that can entertain the viewer and serve the movie at the same time.A great British cast heads Sexy Beast. Ray Winstone is the star of the show as Gal Dove, the crook at the centre of the caper. Ray is an under-utilised talent in the movie industry; he's proved here that he more than do the job, and he also has a great 'crime' voice; upon hearing it, you know you're listening to a hard man. The real star of the show, however, is the title character; played by Ben Kingsley. It is never actually said that he is the title character, but it is obvious that he is to anyone watching the movie. This role is a huge departure from the roles we're used to seeing Kingsley in - such as Gandhi in Gandhi, or some guy from that Schindler's List rubbish, and it's one that suits Kingsley much more than I thought it would. In fact, Kingsley is brilliant in this role; it's maybe even his all time best performance. He brings so much to the table; he's extremely nasty, almost evil; and Kingsley just makes you believe that this man is not someone that you want to mess with. He's not big or strong, it's his aura that gives you this impression, and that is an absolutely great thing for an actor to do. Also starring in the film are Amanda Redman, whom British TV fans will remember from the excellent offbeat sitcom; ""At home with the Braithwaites"" and Ian McShane, who has also done a lot of film and TV work.Overall; Sexy Beast is a rare thing. It's a crime thriller that is original, hilarious and exciting, and relies on it's characters for most of the action. These days, it has become customary for crime thrillers to rip off Pulp Fiction; but this one doesn't need to. Sexy Beast is an absolute highlight and one that shouldn't be missed by anyone.",Sexy Beast
19,Sylviastel,Don't judge a film by it's title!,7,14 May 2003,"Sexy Beast is never fully explained. Perhaps it is a nickname for Ben Kingsley's character. Sir Ben is wonderful in this film as complicated bald British burglar. Ian McShane is deliciously evil in his role as the man behind the master plan. Ian is well deserving of an O.B.E. or a C.B.E. Ray Winstone should also get an O.B.E. for his services to acting. The cast is wonderful including Amanda Redman who is best known for playing the older Diana Dors. I hope they don't forget her for a British honour in the same fashion as the late Diana Dors(she should have been given a C.B.E.)but nevertheless the plot is fun and filled with four letter words, violence, a little sex, and brief nudity scene. Sexy Beast may not have raked it in at the box office. I don't know why but maybe it should have with all the sex, violence, and nudity for American audiences. Isn't that what they want and they don't go for it? Maybe it's the British accents that throws them away but whatever it is worth watching at least once without the children.",Sexy Beast

Having recently been entranced by director Jonathan Glazer's, Under The Skin, decided it was time to see his first film. Three films in 14 years seems pretty slow going but never mind, one more to see after this and I'm up to date. Clearly Mr Glazer doesn't wish to make the same film again and again all his life so he has deliberately set out to make his first three completely different from one another. So, what this has in common with his latest film is that it is very well made. Good looking and a great mix of long and very short shots both in time and in space, he also enables his performers to get fired up with the dialogue and make it their own. Trouble is, of course, is that as I can enjoy a poorly made film that has some verve, some spark or originality, similarly I can not particularly enjoy a well made film. Case in point, Sexy Beast. Gruelling, dynamic and ferocious but nothing original about the story and lots of cockney nastiness and stupidity. Has to be said that the performances are very good. I thought perhaps Ian McShane might be the scariest of the three and had no idea Ben Kingsley would whip up his given dialogue and not just spit it out so much as vomit it all over the place.

Then you are given two candidates: Mr. Gandhi himself, Sir. Ben Kingsley and a bovver heavy Ray Winstone, the choice is rather self- evident. However, that is not the case for UK scenester Jonathan Glazer when he begins to work on his feature film debut SEXY BEAST, who does the obverse, fingers Mr. Winstone for the hapless Gal and Mr. Kingsley for the rivetingly menacing Don Logan, a delectable volte-face rewardingly earns him an Oscar nomination, meantime, Winstone also magnificently brings about an incarnation very different from his usual image, a rough diamond type, graced by the lovey-dovey intimacy between him and his wife DeeDee Dove (Redman), an erstwhile porn star. It is a taut iteration in the UK gangster genre, the story is nothing too sparkling, it is Glazer's swift and impressive execution takes the full credit. The harbinger arrives in its opening, a boulder falls right in into the swimming pool of Gal's villa (which betrays a sloppy CGI burnished effort), while he is sunbathing under the blistering heat, this portends an impending threat which will disrupt the placidity and imperil those who cannot get away, Don Logan is coming to visit, and he will not be in a pleasant mood if he knows that Gal determines to decline his very generous offer. So sparks fly, but not without a droll war of (swearing) words and things will inevitably get physical, Kingsley's intimidating presence deviously pays off the looming dread simply elicited by the mention of his name, and after an ironical turn of events, he does manage to press-gang Gal into partaking in the action however reluctant he is, to break into a bank vault via water pressure, The suspense isn't swelling during the action, but after, when the head of the criminals, Teddy Bass (McShane, another great villain, less showy but infallibly lethal), a character turns out to be far more ruthless than Don Logan, bluffly tells Gal that ""he knows what they did in Spain"" and promises he will come to visit in the due future. Well, why there isn't a sequel to this? Parlaying his reputation as an eclectic music video director into this breakout debut, Glazer has concocted up a stunning-looking fare seeped with robust characterization, pulsating rhythm of montage, scintillating chromatic disposition and optimal pop taste, ultimately transmogrified it into a beguiling conglomerate of romanticism, perversity absurdity and bloody gallows humor like an arch cautionary tale: there is no easy way of going straight, so think twice before you get your feet wet!",Sexy Beast
25,Red-Barracuda,Stylistic and quirky Brit crime movie,8,25 October 2015,"Sexy beast is one of the highly stylised Brit crime films that followed in the wake of the success of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). Like that one, it is full of cockney gangsters, camera trickery and some prominent rock tracks on the soundtrack, in this case an opening scene that plays out to 'Peaches' by The Stranglers. This laconic opening sequence indicates from the outset that this is going to be a crime film coming from a slightly different place though, it concludes with a giant boulder rolling down a hill and crashing into the lead character's pool, just missing him by a whisker. From this early point it becomes obvious that this isn't a film that is really going to go for realism and throughout the picture this is maintained with character actions and the final heist itself always seeming slightly absurd like a fever dream.A former gangster, who has retired to Spain, finds his relaxed lifestyle disrupted when one of his old associates turns up demanding that he return to England to be part of a team who will be executing an elaborate robbery.Directed by Jonathan Glazer who recently delivered the bizarre sci-fi film Under the Skin (2013), this is a short and sharp gangster film which is more character-driven than focused on the crime itself. The latter is a memorably surreal undertaking, which is in keeping with other moments from earlier, including freaky nightmare sequences where the lead character has dreams of a demon rabbit. But maybe for most people, the main draw here is the acting performances - Ray Winstone plays a typical character for him but one with a lot less aggression and much more inner fear, Ben Kingsley turns up and chews the scenery as the overbearing criminal Don Logan, while Ian McShane was, for me, even more intimidating as the top crime boss back in the UK, a character full of quiet, intense menace. Sexy Beast is a well-made Brit crime flick which comes from enough of a different angle to ensure that it doesn't feel too derivative, even if stylistically it owes something to the films of Guy Ritchie to an extent.",Sexy Beast
26,paul2001sw-1,leave it out!,6,4 April 2003,"Sexy Beast is an oddly uneven film.  At times it is a truly menacing melodrama, fuelled by nice-guy Kingsley's extraordinary turn as a psychopath; at times, it tries to be a comedy gangster flick in the manner of ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""; and there are even strange moments when it resembles an art-house film gone wrong. The structure is as unbalanced as the tone.  Logically, the film's Spanish portion should merely set the scene for the English part of the tale; but instead, the latter is presented in perfunctory fashion, almost as a postscript: nothing here is as scary, or intense, as the earlier material.  And choice of the title is also very strange, Kinglsely's character may see himself as a ""Sexy Beast"" but these words hards capture the essence of a film in which this individual is viewed mainly from without not within. For all that, there's some skillful film-making here, but it would have been a better movie if it wasn't so evidently conscious of the huge success of ""Lock Stock"" and the apparent public appetite for gangster pictures.",Sexy Beast
27,bowmanblue,Kingsley rules,8,25 August 2019,"These days I always think of 'Iron Man 3' when I see 2000's 'Sexy Beast.' I'm not versed in the 'Iron Man' comics, but I understood that 'The Mandarin' was Iron Man's 'nemesis.' Therefore, people got very excited when an actor as well-respected as Sir Ben Kingsley was cast in the role, only for him to be completely 'underused.' Personally, I still thought he was good in Marvel's end to the 'Iron Man' trilogy, but I couldn't help but wonder if Tony Stark had to face 'Don Logan' whether he'd be able to win so easily.'Sexy Beast' is a gangster film which is about a retired criminal, Gal, (Ray Winstone) who's living the 'high-life' in sunny Spain on the profits of his crimes. However, what he doesn't know is that he's had the 'honour' of being selected for one last job by Don Logan (Kingsley). And, as you'll find out if you watch this film, Logan isn't the kind of guy who takes a 'No' to his 'kind' offer.The film is one of those that's sort of in 'two halves.' The first is set in Spain and charts Don's attempts to persuade Gal to come back to London to carry out a robbery. The second half... well, you'll just have to find out. However the movie ends, one thing is clear - Kingsley steals every scene. He's awesome. Naturally, his brilliance doesn't mean that he's a 'relatable' character who you'd like to hang out with. In fact, he's more likely to haunt your dreams in a way that only Freddy Kruger could. Kingsley is truly terrifying in the role and 'Sexy Beast' is worth watching purely for his performance alone.Of course that's not to say that Ray Winstone and the rest of the cast aren't good. It's just that Kingsley is just so perfect in the role that he eclipses everyone around him. It probably helps if you're into British gangster films and you should be warned about the strong language, violence and some sexual content (not as much sex as you may think, despite the - slightly misleading - title!).

28,secondtake,Painfully straight forward and overextended movie about have-been criminals,5,1 February 2010,"Sexy Beast (2000)Raw, talky, layered with familiar bad guy stuff, not all that well constructed. Yes, Ben Kingsley is a very foul talking bad man. And the two couples holed up in Spain are curiously eccentric the way aging gangsters and their girls can be. It ends with a kind of bizarre heist scene that makes no sense at all, and though it's filmed in a fun way, you still need some logic to the enterprise. Okay, there is something fun about having bad guys going after other bad guys, but a movie needs a stronger plot, better motivations in the characters, and a more intelligent unfolding of the facts rather than just bang bang bang. You give lead actor Ray Winstone credit for giving it his sweaty, unglamorous all.Who is director Jonathan Glazer? Ah, that's how he got to make this thing in the first place. He's a veteran of music videos (short) and commercials (very short), which is a whole different world from the two hour feature. Musicians have discovered this to their peril when Hollywood types have tried their hand at the three minute MTV form, and now movie audiences are discovering the opposite (see Spike Jonze for an exception).The most interesting part of the movie is almost trivial--a huge boulder rolling down out of the hills and crashing with a splash in their big swimming pool. It settled right in the middle like something from 2001, and is gorgeous. There's enough bad judgement to spread around and share here, both within the plot and surround the making of the movie.

29,johnnyboyz,"Brilliantly engaging and clever gangster film that wraps all sorts of conventions of the genre into one, massive delivery.",10,22 August 2008,"In Sexy Beast, you have one of the most entertaining and most re-watchable British gangster films of recent years. The reasons for this are partly down to its pacing and spacing of the events and scenarios that it takes on as well as its attention to these scenes and partly down to the fact the film acknowledges three or so decades of British gangster genre film-making while mixing it all up under the hybridity of both ganger heavy and gangster light conventions. Sexy Beast works as a well scored artistic piece; it works as the simplest story ever told and it works as a powerhouse of Academy Award nominated acting from certain individuals.When Guy Ritchie exploded onto the scene with his debut feature Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, he (perhaps accidentally) changed the general aesthetic of the British gangster genre. Books and essays have been written on how he incorporated the character of the 'gangster' as a comic figure; someone who spouts quick, quotable dialogue and no matter how badly they get knocked about, they'll always be ready for the next scrap  displaying very little care for pain and very little attention to injury. People wrote about him creating a gangster-light approach as opposed to the harder, perhaps more brutal films prior to 1998 that dealt with 'real' people exploring precarious and dangerous places and getting involved in 'real' situations. Such examples may include the 1980s Bob Hoskins double 'The Long Good Friday' and 'Mona Lisa', both of which in their respective runtimes looked at the danger of the IRA as well as the expansion of Britain as a nation with Mona Lisa looking at the decaying society within Britain, focusing on prostitution and an individual's inability to come to terms with modernity following being away (in prison) for so long. Sexy Beast incorporates both these styles in the sense special effects and 'Lock, Stock...' style transitions will fly into brick walls and floors showing us what is within them, something rare in a pre-1998 gangster film. But it also adopts attributes of the 'heavy' in the sense it is violent: when someone dies, they're down and out and it is realistic in the sense no one is a superhero, withstanding copious amounts of pain.Sexy Beast very quickly establishes its protagonist named Gal (Winstone) and their opinions on Britain. He hates the place and the grotty, grimy existence he once lived. Indeed, when London is presented it is at either at night or raining, maybe both as opposed to the location of Spain, Gal's utopia, which is shot in long, drawn out compositions of warm weather; luxurious locations and generally acts as an attractive place. The idea here being London is a location that is demonised, similarly to the two Hoskins films: full of IRA bombs and prostitution, respectively, covered in both those films. Sexy Beast creates the sense that London is not a nice place, unlike more recent crime films that are full of people dodging, dealing, wise-cracking and getting involved in rather comical shootouts to pace-gathering Greek instrumental music as gang leaders outside are head butted and run over but get up to pursue the fight.Sexy Beast is film that begins exotically, becomes quite brutal with the arrival of Don Logan (Kingsley), before becoming more mellow during a particularly touching telephone conversation in which Gal (in London, his dystopia) speaks to his wife back in Spain who is so worried for him, she cannot even speak bar to say his name faintly. Sexy Beast then takes us to the event the film builds up to and then gives us a daring trip to another character's home while placing our hero Gal in arguably the most danger he's in all film. Sexy Beast is smart like that; it pays homage to the gangster films of 1980s in the sense it is quite artistic with slow-motion sequences of BBQs firing up and distilled colours during Gal's dream sequences of an Uzi wielding man-sized rabbit.The film gives us these artistic sequences, before hitting us with the mob message-boy of Logan whose first line of dialogue in the film is a statement of the situation complete with obscenity rather than a mere greeting upon arrival, immediately placing him amongst the audiences' bad books. The acting and scenes revolving around Logan and Gal are incredible, the film pausing everything it's done to dedicate a subtle scene in which Logan is shaving and talking to himself. It could even be argued Logan takes over as the focus here, as scenes at the airport and on an aeroplane later on add to the mindset he works himself up to, something that will ultimately push Gal onto the journey he will take in this film.But with the film beginning artistically; getting tough when Logan arrives; demonising London as a location when Gal arrives there; giving us the actual job he has to do and then presenting us with a gripping scene in which Gal is 'paid' is all part of this brilliant package. The camera is given special attention; close and intense close ups when Logan and co. sit around a dinning table before allowing us to breath with the mid-shots in the kitchen; Logan's back-story with another character and the general use of music, special effects and shot choice all work together and produce a British gangster film worthy of any top ten cannon of the genre, and that counts for all time.",Sexy Beast

Well, I wound up doing just that because Logan was such a blatant ""I get my way or else"" type.

Ian McShane plays Teddy Bass. a man who says more with his stoic facial expressions, than with his voice.

The old gang he ran with back in the day wants him to pull off another job, so they send Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) from London to encourage the relaxed former bad guy. But Gal's out of the game, y'see, and he says no. Repeatedly. Retired, he says. Done, he says. Trying to go legit, he says. Don't they always try to go legit? And then the Big Boys want them to pull of One Last Heist, or some such nonsense? And so the old fart straps on his hoodlum scowl and gets to work. They never stay straight, these guys.
So much of the dialog in this movie is utterly incomprehensible, at least if you're not from England. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the British speak English? The Cockney dialects are unintelligible, at least at the beginning. I suspect that once you get used to the accents, you can pick up at least some of the words, but for my money this is a movie that should have had extensive subtitles. As a point of reference, in Snatch (2001), Brad Pitt's character was an Irish gypsy who spoke a completely unrecognizable dialect - it was so muddled that even the other characters had no idea what he was saying! This movie's a lot like that, only the joke's on the audience, not the characters.It's violent, and it does have its twists, which are both usually good points in a movie of this genre. The movie received quite a bit of acclaim when it came out in the theaters because of Kingsley's performance (this ain't Ghandi, a role he perfected with an Oscar in 1982); however, I don't see his work as fine acting - I see it as overacting. He's hammy, not nuanced. People see a lot of energy, which Kingsley surely brings, and assume it to mean the guy's acting up a storm. Well, chewing scenery is acting up a storm, too - just not good acting. The rest of the cast is relatively faceless, including Amanda Redman as Gil's ex-porn-star wife (I just wanted to use the words ""porn star"" in this review somewhere!). None of them stand out above the others; Kingsley only stands out on the basis of name recognition. I'm a little amazed that this received the praise it did, particularly for Kingsley himself. It's not solid entertainment at all, and not worth the bucks to see it, although the plot does scamper along pretty well.

35,MaxBorg89,"Sexy, and quite brutal, too",8,23 April 2008,"""These are hard men. They could have the Sopranos for dinner, throw up and have them again."". That's Roger Ebert describing London-based gangsters in his review of Sexy Beast. Now, claiming any criminal would be more ruthless than Tony Soprano and his crew would normally border on heresy, but he's got a point, and it's quite likely David Chase, creator of The Sopranos, was familiar with Ebert's assessment when he convinced Ben Kingsley to play himself in the show's sixth season.The film is ostensibly about two conflicting views on crime: one that embraces it wholeheartedly, and one that believes the glory days are gone for good. The latter philosophy is embodied by Gary ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone), a former mobster who now lives in Spain with his wife (the opening shots, with Gal getting a tan by the pool, kind of give away the director's TV ad background). He is perfectly happy, and dismisses England as ""a sh*thole"". His peaceful lifestyle is however interrupted by the abrupt arrival of his former associate Don Logan (Kingsley). Don is there because another partner of theirs, Teddy Bass (Ian McShane), is planning a near-perfect heist, and they both feel Gal would be the perfect man for the job. Too bad Gal himself doesn't agree on that one: he is, after all, retired. Unfortunately, the only answer the increasingly abusive Don will accept is ""yes"". Even better, to use his own words: ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"".Astonishingly, that's only half the movie: the rest takes place in London, where the heist is pulled off after we learn Gal accepted the offer for some undisclosed reason and Don's mysteriously disappeared. We therefore shift from one film to another, almost, and the transition isn't exactly smooth: while the crude, brutal atmosphere is retained for the duration of the story, the more traditional Cockney setting in the second half isn't exactly as gritty as the Spanish showdown between Gal and Don.The conflict: that's where the film's heart truly lies, and it must be said both stars do a surprising job. Winstone, who made his name playing borderline psychos in Scum and Nil by Mouth, goes for a subdued turn as the more mannered Gal, as opposed to the subtle but unmistakably cruel work coming from McShane (an obvious blueprint for the latter's epic performance in Deadwood). But it is Kingsley's transformation that shocks the most: this is the man who played Gandhi and Schindler's accountant, throwing out obscenities as he pleases and hitting random objects whenever he feels like it. Just watch the scene where he suddenly kicks Winstone in the gut, and you'll know why he should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2000 (which went to the equally deserving Benicio del Toro): it's a bold, shameless, scary effort, so full of energy it nearly cripples the movie's third act since Kingsley is nowhere to be seen in the last section. Like R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, the actor is almost bigger than the feature.All in all, a very damn good gangster flick. Recommended especially if you didn't particularly enjoy Guy Ritchie's stylized take on the genre. Just don't get on Don's wrong side.8,5/10",Sexy Beast
36,jimbo-53-186511,Superb character driven vehicle with excellent performances from both Kingsley and Winstone,7,27 August 2014,"Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is a retired safe cracker for the criminal underworld who has moved over to Spain to 'enjoy' his retirement. Things are great for Ray, he spends his days lounging by the pool in his apartment, dining out at restaurants and generally living a care free existence. However, Gal's care free existence is tipped upside down when his friend Jackie (Julianne White) receives a call from Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) who says that he wants Gal to join him in London to help him and his cronies to pull off one last job. Logan gets on a plane and heads for Spain intent on Gal coming back with him to assist in pulling off this job. Gal refuses to do the job, but Don is not the sort of person who takes 'No' for an answer and is determined that Gal will assist with this job whether he likes it or not.What's interesting about Sexy Beast is that it is a character driven film rather than a plot driven film. Character driven films are generally risky because typically if the characters aren't well written then the film will fail - that's not the case here. There is only about a 5 minute segment from the 90 minute running time spent on explaining the heist and it's only sporadically mentioned outside of this scene - until the end when the heist takes place. I could probably fill a 1000 word limit just writing about Kingsley's character, but due to IMDb word constraints I will try and keep my comments on his character as short as possible. On the surface, Logan is a thug, he's arrogant, he likes to let people know he's in charge. If you go deeper into his character, I see a very troubled person - it's clear to me that he's some kind of paranoid schizophrenic (the scene where he's talking to himself in the mirror and claiming that Gal has said various things about him - none of these things have ever been said and it clearly shows that he suffers from mass paranoia). He then proceeds to attack Gal based on what his 'inner' voice is telling him. Likewise, the scene when he's on board the aircraft and he refuses to put his cigarette out - this can be looked at in two ways; 1) He intended to fly back to London, but doesn't like being told what to do and doesn't like conforming to rules and therefore refused to co-operate or 2) He became a nuisance because he deliberately wanted to get kicked off the plane because he needed to complete his task of getting Gal back to London. His reasons are wide open to interpretation and the fact that we're never quite sure what he's thinking or what he's going to do ultimately made him a fascinating character. He's clearly not insane though as the scene immediately after his departure from the aircraft clearly demonstrates -the way he managed to turn the scenario around to make the airport staff believe that he was the victim was not only cold and calculating, but he also made his sob story believable. This shows that Logan is also capable of pathological lying as well as paranoid schizophrenia. What a character!Then we come to Gal; people tend to remember Kingsley's performance in this film (with good reason), but people really shouldn't discount Winstone's performance. His best scenes are the scenes when he is with Logan - Winstone gives a really convincing performance (particularly in scenes where Logan is intimidating him - I felt scared for him and that's a testament to Winstone's acting ability which I think is much better than many people give him credit for).The direction and editing were superb as well; lots of quick editing and stylish camera work that linked scenes together nicely. It was all really clever so full marks go to Glazer for his terrific work. The music was also great; it was retro and cool and fitted in nicely with the tone of the film.Ironically, the weakest part of the film is the heist itself which if I'm honest was a bit dull and derivative, but it didn't bother me because I was so fascinated by the array of interesting characters that I still enjoyed the film even though the plot seemed to take a back seat in the film.Sexy Beast is a great little film which is bound to impress those that love character driven films. It's a rare example of a film that is great despite the fact that the plot takes a back seat to such an extent that it almost becomes insignificant. It sounds bizarre saying this, but if you've watched the film you'll understand what I mean.",Sexy Beast

It takes a considerable amount of work to fully realize a character, bring them to life, make them seem genuine, lifelike and idiosyncratic so as to win over the viewer and elicit the modernized 'putting down the iPhone to engage with full attention' reaction', but Kingsley's rabid London hoodlum Don Logan is just that creation, and then some. He's not even the lead character either, yet royally steals the film, which earned him an Oscar nomination. The film itself couldn't be more brilliant either, cooked up via a stinging, gorgeously verbose script by Louis Mellos and David Scinto, glossy wit from director Jonathan Glazer and actors who go the extra mile to give a fairly arch story some tangible depth. Ray Winstone, reliably superb, is Gal Dove, a boisterous ex criminal who has retired to sunniest Spain with his sexy wife (Amanda Redman) and best friend (Cavan Kendall). Retirement is tricky for someone with Gal's past though, and soon his past barges through the front door in the form of Kingsley's Logan, a terrifying bald beast of a man that would give any sensible person cause to immediately run and hide in the nearest cupboard. From the moment he shows up, heralded by bad dreams that plague Gal and a literal boulder that cascades down the hill into his villa pool uninvited (hello metaphor), things go from worse to hellish. Logan isn't the type of man to take no for an answer, and is a complete and total nightmare to deal with even before Gal tries to shut him down. Logan wants him for a job in London, organized by shark of a mob boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane, creepy as all hell), but Gal has no interest leaving the sunny shores and just wants the nutter out of his house. Any time Kingsley is on screen you can feel the tension crackle in the air. He's the unvarnished hyena to Winstone's aloof, relaxed teddy bear, a force to be reckoned with and feared. His use of profanity lands like a backhander from Dwayne Johnson, his body language is erratic enough to induce seizures and that cobra gaze could melt adamantium. He's the penultimate antagonist and raises the stakes to the stratosphere, berating every person in sight and maintaining a cold, detached veneer that's more than slightly disconcerting. Not to mention the guy talks to himself in the mirror, which alone is cause for worry. While the story takes place in our world, there's an off kilter, demonically surreal undertone that derails genre conventions. The artfully dirty, near poetic screenplay, stark visions of some sort of evil Chernobyl rabbit thing, lurid editing transitions, whatever it is it's hard to pin down or describe, but you feel miles from your comfort zone and ever so slightly removed from our solar system while watching this odd, scary, compelling and uniquely peculiar piece of work.",Sexy Beast

He rebuffs to go back to London to take part in a final bank heist set up by Logan's superior Teddy (Ian McShane). Logan is the person who doesn't accept no for an answer which Dove informs our audience and I couldn't agree more. Logan's fearful ways is not based off of his toughness, but because he is an angry tyrant by nature. He has the instincts of a doberman, hard-nosed vicious. He takes the loyalties to please his leader an inject fear to those who cross his path. He has a natural talent for utilizing absurdities in volatile way and shows no apologies about it.""Sexy Beast"" falls in the annals of movies that centres around Cockney people of England along with ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""The Limey"". Along with the lines with the darker underground of London, the characters depicted falls right into place. Dove's a gangster who wants out, Logan's manipulation is to inflict fear, Teddy the ringleader has everything in place for this heist and Harry (James Fox) who thinks Teddy's his lover owns the bank and believes his bank is impregnable. The heist at times seems a bit peculiar once Dove agrees to along with it. The criminals seems to have access to this Turkish bathhouse where the vault is, but they lack common sense being they should have drained the pool so the crooks wear breathing gear to get to the vault which naturally the water fills up which leads to an incredible scene where a crook finds a deposit box hoping it contains something valuable, only to get an unpleasant surprise. The opening scene is really quite an eyeful. We see Dove at the Spanish villa sunning himself by the pool, when all of the sudden a giant boulder comes crashing down and nearly crushes him to death. That scene alone is very metaphoric. Eventually, Dove becomes the boulder by the time the second act turns. Kingsley has demonstrated that he can play any character you throw at him. He is scary, ruthless, manipulative, short-tempered, and feeds of his word with remorseless frustration. I never thought he had it in him. His most cunning was the scene where while on flight from Spain to England, where an attendant asked him not to smoke on the plane and to put his cigarette out. But Logan will not oblige without a fight. That scene was worth the applause from the audience. Ray Winstone turns in great performance as Dove, but just was badly upstaged by Kingsley's performance. Winstone has played fearful brutes as well. Who can forget his scary performance as an abusive father in Gary Oldman's ""Nil By Mouth"" or in ""The War Zone"" starring Tim Roth. When these performers want Winstone as their villain, they sure could get it out of him. Dove is portrayed as a gangster going legit, retreating to the softer side of life who can still inject fear among the residence in the villa, but is still frightened by Logan.The humour in this movie is usurped by the thriller this movie depicts. Once the heist is done Teddy (cunning but laid-back) offers Dove a ride to the airport, which has few surprises in itself, part jilted, part ironic. These are tough guys that could make ""The Sopranos"" take notes from them.",Sexy Beast

41,bandw,A strange attractor,10,9 April 2007,"This film is in the top tier of my favorites. I didn't know quite what to make of it on seeing it the first time, but it has had the power to draw me back for many viewings.It's the story of Gal (Ray Winstone), a former London gangster, who is approached by Don (Ben Kingsley), a one-time accomplice, to participate in a big heist. Gal has retreated to a Spanish villa with his wife Deedee and considers himself well retired from a life of crime. It is an understatement to say that Don is not the type of person who will take ""No"" for an answer.Kingsley's performance is absolutely riveting. He plays Don as one of the most frightening and sinister characters I have ever seen on the screen (and, thankfully, in real life as well). He is so good that you have to rethink what sort of person Kingsley really is that he could so embrace this role.You should not let Kingsley's performance overshadow that of Winstone, as his performance is quite nuanced and in its own way is as impressive as Kingsley's. He is perfect at playing the part of the tough guy gone soft. Winstone has some great reaction shots - in response to one of Don's outbursts Gal gives off a subtle wry smile that says, ""This guy really *is* a piece of work,"" and makes you think that somewhere in the past Gal had some fondness for Don, or at least had an appreciation of his unique qualities. Also, in the restaurant scene early on when Gal is told that Don is going to show up at his villa, Winstone's reaction is wonderful to behold.The relationships between Don, Gal, Deedee, Gal's friend Aitch and Aitch's wife Jackie are complex. We get to know these characters at a much deeper level than in your average crime drama. One can only speculate about Don's past, but you feel he has never been able to achieve any successful relationships and has reacted to his rejections by becoming an intimidating bully. However, I don't think you get as far from the norm as Don without having some genetic predisposition. Don is attracted to Gal (at one point he actually says, ""I love you Gal""), but he is also intensely jealous of Gal for being a person whom everybody likes. Don's frustrations manifest in vitriolic verbal abuse and when Gal confronts him with a truth about his concealed feelings for Jackie, Don unleashes the most vicious verbal attack that you are likely ever to see. Truly scary. Gal's love for Deedee is tenderly portrayed - in the opening scene where Gal is sunning himself by the pool, the camera cuts to reveal interlocking hearts inlaid in the tiles at the bottom of the pool. The boulder that rolls out of the hills smashes these hearts and presages things to come. Then there is Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) who is the mastermind behind the heist. Teddy has a smile that is so evil that it's enough to make you recoil when you see it. In one scene between Teddy and Gal you can hear Gal's shallow fearful breathing and well understand the reason for it. Don and Teddy make your common thugs seem rather harmless.The entire cast is first rate. Of note is a winning young Spanish boy named Enrique (Álvaro Monje) who helps around the villa - he plays a small but essential part. Don is suspicious about just what Enrique's role is at the villa, and we are left to wonder about that as well, but it is clear that he and Gal have an affectionate relationship.In addition to the outstanding performances, some fantastic editing keeps this film going. Why the film did not win an award, or even a nomination, for best editing I don't know. Some sequences are pure genius, like the cutting in and out between past and present when Don is explaining to Gal what the heist is all about. And some of the quick cuts between Gal and Don that match their staccato conversation are effective. The rapid fire cuts between past and present toward the end are striking. The music is an essential element; it neatly underscores the varying moods. There is original music by Roque Baños - his musical accompaniment to Gal's fear dreams adds a haunting quality to those masterly filmed sequences. And there are other noteworthy tracks such as ""Peaches"" by the Stranglers (that helps make the opening scenes so transfixing) and ""Sway"" from an early 1950s track by Dean Martin (that serves as a pleasant desert played over the closing titles). If your audio system does not have full bass, you will be missing the complete emotional experience the soundtrack has to offer.Americans may have some trouble with the accents - turn on subtitles for your first viewing. I have seen this movie so many times now that I have pretty much memorized the dialog. Also, if you are offended by strong language, you may want to give this a miss.At the end we are enticed into thinking that things have returned to carefree living in the villa for Gal and his friends. The broken hearts in the pool have been repaired and all is well with the world. But beneath those patched hearts lies a past that may come back to haunt these happy people. Teddy could decide to come visit at any time. Indeed, we are all trapped by our pasts, every move we make is constrained by our previous history.In summary, I quote Gal from the first part of the movie as he is sunning himself by the pool, ""Fan-dabby-dozy-tastic.""",Sexy Beast
42,DJAkin,Strange movie kind of like Snatch on Steriods,5,5 April 2002,"I liked this movie due to the intense feelings that Ben Kingsley made you feel.  It was very tense in the scenes where he would try to coax his old friend into taking the job.  I know that the cockney accents were hard to understand.  That's why I used the subtitles.  That was a good feature.  I checked out the directors commentary and it was not all that great.  This is a good movie though.  I would suggest seeing it for sure.  There were many scenes where Ben Kingsley's character (named Don Logan) would get so mad at Gal!!  He would yell the word ""yes"" or ""no"" over like 10 times!!  The plot was just a typical ""one late heist"" plot.  It was good acting all over though.  I give this a finger up.",Sexy Beast
43,seymourblack-1,"When ""No"" Is Not An Option",8,2 November 2016,"Action, black comedy and violence all figure prominently in this tense crime drama that illustrates brilliantly how a combination of stylish presentation, good pacing and interesting characters can elevate a hackneyed plot into something special. Its story about an ex-criminal getting involved in ""one last job"" is told with great economy, quirkiness and realism and the dialogue (although heavily laden with profanities) is sharp, punchy and witty throughout.After a criminal career that ended with a prison sentence, ex-safe-cracker Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) has retired to a comfortable lifestyle in Spain's Costa del Sol where he enjoys living with his ex-porn star wife Deedee (Amanda Redman) and sunning himself by his villa's swimming pool. One day, his tranquillity is interrupted when a boulder unexpectedly tumbles down the steep hill just behind where he'd been sun bathing and after missing him by the narrowest of margins, comes to rest at the bottom of his pool. This scary incident turns out to be something of an omen, as shortly after, one of his old criminal associates arrives from London to try to persuade him to take part in a planned bank heist.The idyllic existence that Gal, Deedee and their best friends Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White) had shared up until that point ends abruptly with the arrival of Don Logan (Ben Kingsley). They're all terrified of this unhinged sociopath who they know, from previous experience, has an explosive temper and is capable of extreme violence. Gal doesn't want to get involved in any form of criminal activity again, especially as he'd promised Deedee that he wouldn't. She's the love of his life and he's desperate not to break his promise to her but also fully realises the threat that he's under if he doesn't do what Logan wants. The exchanges that take place when they all meet are characterised by extreme fear on the parts of the four local residents and a whole welter of diabolical threats made by the foul-mouthed Logan.A little while after the meeting at the villa, Gal arrives in London where he meets crime boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane). He's the mastermind behind the plan to break into a safe-deposit vault from the Turkish bath establishment next door and as Logan works for him, he questions Gal about his recruiter's whereabouts. Gal tells him that the two men travelled back to London separately and claims that they'd spoken to each other by phone after Logan's arrival at Heathrow. Bass looks more than a little sceptical about this information but nevertheless, the heist goes ahead as planned and after it's completed successfully, Gal's anxiety remains at an almost unbearably high level until he gets back home with the intention of making a quick return to the life of leisure that he loves so much.""Sexy Beast"" provides a very authentic-looking picture of the London gangster fraternity and conveys just how threatening people like Logan and Bass are. Ben Kingsley makes a huge impact as Logan whose raging and determination not to take ""no"" for an answer, is incredibly unrelenting and makes any attempt at negotiation or reasoning totally impossible. Teddy Bass is more cultivated, soft-spoken and suave but also carries an enormous threat as is clearly shown in some of the action that follows the heist. Ian McShane makes his character's viciousness absolutely convincing and Ray Winstone, in a wonderfully sensitive performance, does a great job of making his flabby, gone-to-seed, ex-con into a really sympathetic character who's impossible to dislike. The quality of the supporting performances is also consistently top class.Amusingly, the boulder incident that came so close to killing Gal at the beginning of the story also provides him with an important solution to his life-threatening problem by the end of the story.",Sexy Beast
44,Angelus2,What's so great about this film?,2,22 December 2010,"Don Logan a notorious feared Gangster arrives in Spain, looking to include his friend Gary in a armed robbery, however Gary has no intention of going back to London...But Don Logan is not someone who takes 'No' for an answer.For years, this one movie kept coming up whenever there was a discussion on the genre of 'Gangster', it was described as by some the pinnacle of 'British Gangster' films, it was 'raw and moving', 'terrifying and stomach churning'....So, I decided to watch this and I have to say, I was disappointed. Now, I'm a person who enjoys drama's with well structured story lines and riveting dialogue, but this is not that...The Don Logan can be described as scary, but thats all the film has..And of course, Don Logan's demonic alter-ego.The film is slow paced and weak, especially considering the talent it holds, Ben Kingsely, Ray Winstone, Amanda Redman & Ian Mcshane.",Sexy Beast

46,mattymatt4ever,Ben Kingsley is worth the rental price alone!,8,7 June 2002,"To put it simply:  I love this movie!  I've really been looking forward to this movie, mostly because of Kingsley's acclaimed performance.  And he is indeed brilliant in the role of the brash, uninhibited, shamelessly ruthless Don Logan--a role that should go down in history.  I haven't seen Jim Broadbent's performance in ""Iris,"" so I can't technically say if Kingsley deserved the Oscar over him, but I'm glad he got nominated, because it would be an abomination if he didn't.  Kingsley is absolutely terrifying, not showing a bit of remorse.  And it's a real joy to see the man who's famous for playing the well-known pacifist Gandhi take on a role which requires him to spout the ""f"" word 500 times in one whole minute.  OK, I may have been exaggerating there, but believe me...there are scenes in this movie that make ""Pulp Fiction"" look like a G-rated Disney feature.  Let's just say I've never heard the ""f"" word used so many times, at such a lightning-fast pace. Kingsley has some memorable moments, including one where he gets in trouble for smoking on a plane, and cops an alibi involving the male flight attendants sexually abusing him.  As cruel as he is, I found myself laughing hysterically at Don.  As Kingsley said himself, Don is the type of character who says the kind of things that are on most people's minds, but they're too afraid to let it out.    Though Kinglsey steals the film, Ray Winstone is the star and he's also great.  I haven't seen a great many English films, so I don't remember seeing him before, but now I hope to see him in more films.  And I was impressed to find out the movie was made by a first-time director.  Jonathan Glazer did a terrific job, creating a gloriously frenetic pace.  The running time is a succinct 85 minutes, and the film never takes a breath.  It always captures you with in-your-face images.  Glazer's sense of style is amazing. Not to mention the soundtrack is excellent.  It's a nice irony:  how this dark comedy ends to the tune of Dean Martin's ""Sway."" 
On my first viewing, it took time for me to get accustomed to the cockney accents, but after approximately 30 minutes I was able to decipher most of the dialogue--and the film has some great, memorable dialogue!  It's not like with ""Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels"" where I can watch it 100 times and still need subtitles.  Not to mention ""Sexy Beast"" is a much more entertaining film.  All I can say is don't expect an intricate plot, with many twists and turns. The plot is all pretty simple:  Retired gangster lounges around his beautiful house in Spain, then gets persuaded into doing one last heist. I'm sure that sounds very familiar.  But the beauty is in its simplicity. And the film isn't in any way pretentious.  It is what it is--and what it is is a smart, energetic, entertaining, hilarious, extremely well-acted dark comedy.  My score:  8 (out of 10)",Sexy Beast
47,CharltonBoy,"Acting at it's very,very best from Winstone and Kingsley",8,10 October 2001,"If you like a film that feature two lead actors battling with and against each other with supreme brillance, if you love Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley and if you love films that mascerade as a gangster movie ,a love story and comedy to boot you will love Sexy Beast. Ray Winstone (Gal) plays an ex con who lives happily in Spain with a wife he loves who gets a visit from a gangster played by Ben Kingsley (Don Logan) asking him to do a last job for the firm. This film is not so much about the story but more about the people who are in the story. It is not often Ray Winstone is over shadowed by another lead actor but in this Ben Kingsley is just fantastic as Don Logan. You remember how frightening Joe Pesci is as a nasty piece of work in Goodfellas ,well Kingsley matches that and maybe overpasses Pesci's character for sheer crazyness and horror. I hated the guy with a passion yet he still frightened me. This film has bad language throughout so if you are easily offended give this a miss but on the other hand you will be missing a treat!! 8 out of 10.",Sexy Beast
48,gbheron,Kingsley is Dynamite,9,20 July 2002,"Ben Kingsley's portrayal of gangster Don Logan is destined to go down as one of the most memorable mobsters in filmdom; up there with the best from Robinson, Bogart, Cagney, Raft, deNiro, Pacino et al. Kingsley's all that good and more.  And the other actors, in their portrayals of fellow gangsters and their lovers, are also excellent.  The story is simple. Gal (Ray Winstone) is a retired English gangster living a life of leisure at his Spanish villa. Then one day his idyll is shattered by a visit from Don Logan, an old protégé, and man to be feared. Logan's intent is to lure Gal out of retirement for 'one last job'. Gal wants nothing to do with it, and the first half of the movie is a battle of wits between the two men. The second half of the film deals with the heist and its aftermath.  The crime is downplayed in the movie which is primarily a psychological exploration of these gangsters; their personal demons, and the relationships amongst themselves. They are indeed scary people, no sympathetic characters here.
This is one of the best movies of 2000, and is highly recommended. I don't understand how IMDb reviewers can rate this movie so low. In my book it definitely rates an ""A"".",Sexy Beast
49,Rogue-32,For Best Portrayal of a Rabid Dog...,8,19 April 2003,"..the Winner is...Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, hands down (and panting on all fours).  Ben also wins the award for Best (and most frequent and creative) Usage of the ""c"" word, which plays a major part in this outrageously deranged and always thoroughly entertaining (even at its bloodiest) full-frontal bombast of a film.The plot couldn't be any simpler: retired gangster Gal (yes, that's his name) is happy lounging around the pool at his Spanish villa with the woman of his dreams and a drink in his hand.  But the big bad brutal bulldog Don (Kingsley) has been sent to convince him to do One Last Job.  Gal says no. Donnie doesn't like this answer. Violence ensues.To say any more would be a disservice; this movie has to be experienced, not explained.  Suffice to say, the brilliant performances (Ray Winstone and Ian McShane in particular) and the amazingly slick editing make every second of Sexy Beast a kinetic foray into surrealism and a tour de force of epic proportions for Kingsley. So why are you still bloody sitting there, you steaming c***?!!! Go rent it now.",Sexy Beast
50,ajs-10,A great performance from Ben Kingsley...,8,29 April 2011,"Whenever I'm in a conversation about British gangster movies, this one always comes up. Much to my dismay, I haven't been able comment because, for one reason or another, I kept missing it. This was remedied recently when it finally re-appeared on TV. It's an interesting film that's marked by one particularly extraordinary performance and an awful lot of profanity (swearing).Gary 'Gal' Dove is a retired gangster, he lives in Spain with his wife, Dee Dee. His friend, and ex-colleague, Aitch and wife Jackie live nearby and they barbecue, hunt, eat, drink and generally lie in the sun and have a good time. This is until the day Jackie receives a phone call from Don Logan. Don is a nasty piece of work who has decided he wants Gal to come out of retirement to do one more job. The thing is, Gal is happy with his life and doesn't want to go back, but Don is on his way to persuade him. Also, an ulterior motive is revealed for Don's visit that leaves all involved feeling quite uneasy. Now, the heist is being planned by crime boss Teddy Bass and it involves the robbery of a depositary owned by a character known as Harry, but can Gal be persuaded.There is a really good cast in this one; Ray Winstone plays Gal very well, he has all the attributes to pull off this role with aplomb. Amanda Redman plays Dee Dee, his wife, Cavan Kendall is Aitch and Julianne White is Jackie. Teddy Bass is played by another well known British actor, Ian McShane, as is Harry, who is played by James Fox. But the star accolade must go to Ben Kingsley as Don Logan, I don't know what he was on, but he pulls of a masterly performance in this one. It's so different to everything else I've seen him in and I loved every minute he was on screen.I really enjoyed this film, admittedly, the performance of Ben Kingsley has a lot to do with that, but there were also a few rather innovative touches that made the story a bit more interesting that it might have been. So, over all, it's a pretty well made film with a decent cast, an interesting plot, one stellar performance and an awful lot of swearing Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",Sexy Beast

In ""Sexy beast"" he seems to be a little Scorsese, with oniric deliriums, a nice sense of humor, and a pretty nice rhythm.The story in ""SB"" is as follows: a former English criminal lives retired somewhere in the southern Spanish coast. One day his old boss (Ben Kingsley playing the craziest character he's ever played) comes to visit him... That's also true: when you've been in that kind of ""business"" you can never retired for good.

52,Pedro_H,Stylish and slick - what there is of it.,7,16 September 2005,"Sexy Beast is a very short film (too short really) and yet it fills every frame and every moment with tension, menace and intrigue. While it is a crime story, a character study and a three act play the portions are far from equal and the dialogue is hard to catch - even with an English ear.There are plenty of directors that would have padded this out with extra dinner scenes, meetings at airports and bland criminal chit-chat but the producers don't want to - every scene has a purpose and if you take one out the whole house of cards collapses.(Not sure about the hare symbolism though - what is that all about?)Retired crook Gary 'Gal' Dove (Ray Winston) is wanted for ""one last job"" by psycho hard nut and fixer Don Logan (Ben Kinsley) - BK having the time of his life with a part no one could imagine him playing. Words come thick and fast from his mouth - most of them obscene, but he gets his point across: often by simply screaming the word ""yes"" over and over again. His performance is worth the price of the ticket by itself.Winston is the British version of Gérard Depardieu. He is not traditionally handsome and he is getting more than a bit flabby, but the camera loves him. He is a reactor most of the time here and that suits him - from Scum (which is a truly frightening film) and Nil By Mouth we know he can be frightening - but here he plays frightened.In contrast Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) is the slick and quick ""Mr Black Magic."" The guy who wants to get things done and is no less deadly, but in a more laid back and slicked way. He provides the how and the why that keeps the pot boiling. Sadly there isn't enough of him to say much more.With the quality of acting and actors on display here you are disappointed by the length and width. Porn star wife Deedee Dove (Amanda Redman) hardly gets a look in on the stopwatch although she does provide a point of high drama.Here even the central crime (or planned crime) seems merely a device to get the characters together and a lot of potential meat is thrown away. A crime film that doesn't seem all that interested in the crime. Strange as that might sound.Most films try and be too ambitious and fall foul of that while Sexy Beast is under ambitious and falls foul on that score - there is a longer and more intricate film waiting to get out if only they had let it. Yes, could have become a classic rather than a classic case of simply being very good.",Sexy Beast
53,tonypeacock-1,Slightly overrated. Cockney dialogue delight.,7,15 June 2019,"Slightly overrated British gangster film from 2000 that is saved by some excellent individual performances.At the time quite a few mediocre British crime films seemed to be flooding the market. The prerequisite being that the cast had to talk with a Cockney (London) accent and follow a football club called West Ham United!Sexy Beast steers away from your usual action sequences like car chases and police pursuits and features some good dialogue between some good cast members. Ray Winstone plays Gal, a retired forty something ex-con from England who has now set up home in sunny Spain with his wife DeeDee, and friends Aitch and Jackie. The Eldorado lifestyle seems to involve plenty of sun(burn), swimming pool set up and dining out. A far cry from sunny London!Their peaceful life is shattered when it is revealed that Sociopath Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) is en route to Spain to try and persuade safecracker Gal to partake in another job, masterminded by Teddy Bass (Lovejoy actor Ian McShane).Logan seems not to be a character that will take no for an answer and what follows is about an hour of attempting to persuade Gal with some frightful scenes, revelations and consequences for everybody.It is in these scenes that Kingsley oozes Sociopathic rage. The dialogue scenes between him and Winstone are a delight even if the Cockney accent proves a problem to some international audiences!The film doesn't go on to long, but to compare it to some of the classic British gangster films like The Long Good Friday is a disservice to them.",Sexy Beast

All seems well till a huge boulder rolls down the mountain, launches itself into the grounds of his villa and misses him by centimetres before a huge splashdown in his outdoor pool.It is an astounding opening, played comically as Gal cools himself with a tiny battery-operated fan, but bringing in a sense of foreboding that is brought to fruition when the four pals have dinner and news of a phone call is passed on. From Don Logan.Enter Ben Kingsley, complaining about a sweaty shirt, and immediately you feel the first trickles of sweat on your own brow. Kingsley puts in a powerhouse performance as psychotic Don, at his most frightening when most vulnerable, talking to himself in the mirror about his loose mouth. Kingsley plays Don as childish, intolerant, moody, and utterly utterly vicious. It is the role Winstone has made his own over the years, from Scum through to Nil by Mouth, and casting him on the receiving end is a nice ironic touch. It also allows Winstone to exercise his range more than usual and he does not come up short.The film inevitably flags when Don is absent, but to the filmmakers credit the pacing of the final third is briskly done, an awareness that McShane and Fox could not outshine Don.Overall, it's partly a heist story, but mostly a love story, one man's attempt to cover for and get back to the woman he loves.The director's music video roots are for the most part used well in surreal dream sequences with a mutated rabbit, though personally I could have done without the final underground shot that seemed to detract from the overall oppressive tone. A minor quibble, as this film is a near perfect blend of tension, humour, romance, dread and horror. Pretty much unmissable.",Sexy Beast

It's not about planning and out smarting cops, it's about Gary, who really, really doesn't want to do it. It's just that his psychotic friend Don want him to do it.Actors play the biggest part in the film and Ben Kingsley really shows why he has deserved his Oscar. Ian MacShane has a small, yet important part in the film as the primus motor, who sets the ball rolling.Direction is good and the film even manages to have couple of quite a visually creative scenes in it. Most of the obscure jokes have been left in the beginning of the film, so that also is a difference between SB and other heist films. Thought there is a bit darker undertone of humor going on in the back ground. Over all a good, a bit different heist flick.",Sexy Beast
56,bopdog,Brilliant! Kingsley=Oscar! But did I miss a piece of the story?,8,20 March 2002,"Ben Kingsley deserves his Oscar nomination for his role as the whacked out Don in ""Sexy Beast."" The rest of the cast is very good as well. The movie is intriguing, visually interesting, and certainly not ordinary! There were clever director's touches, such as jumping times and interlocutors as stories were told, and questions were asked and answered.But something also isn't quite right. It's not ""wrong,"" mind you, but the whole thing isn't quite enough of a story to satisfy. Please don't assume that because I am an American that I was wishing for more nakedness, or some Iberian car chases. Rather, and I'm not talented enough to know exactly what (if I were, I'd be writing movies, instead of merely watching them!), but the story arc, or story depth, or story SOMETHING is off-calibration. Perhaps it starts too early, or perhaps doesn't go long enough? We seem to be told a whole lot about a couple of simple things: Gal (the one hero) wants to stay home in Spain. Don (Ben Kingsley's whack dude) wants him to go to London for a crime job. Okaaaaaay. That sparseness is admirable. But somehow it isn't quite enough to give a 100 minute movie ""legs."" It's more of a glimpse, or even a glance at an mere event. It's a snapshot, like an old short story, but without the oldtime short story punchline. It's a great middle of a movie, or a beginning--- but I felt a bit undernourished as an audience member when the movie ended. Nothing really happened emotionally or spiritually, or whatever-ly. We don't know any more about anybody or anything, really, at the end that we didn't already know at the beginning.Still and all, it's an exciting experience. Remarking on the buzz, I kept hearing about Kingsley's character, and how shark-like, and unremittingly evil he was, and how mean and nasty and horrible and all of that. How is was an amazing spewer of vileness and hate... Yikes! That actually turned me off, and kept me from seeing the movie when it was in the local theater. I was expecting some kind of protracted ""Cape Fear,"" or much worse. I dislike movie-length ugliness. As it is, Kingsley's character could be said to be all of that, maybe-kinda. He was more much more interesting, however. More subtle, more understandable. In a weird way, Kingsley's Don was almost whimsical. Certainly, he wasn't hard to watch. I gave ""Sexy Beast"" an 8/10.",Sexy Beast
57,the red duchess,One of the most extraordinary performances ever seen on film.(possible spoiler),6,6 February 2001,"'Sexy Beast' has been garnering some acclaim in Britain at the moment.  I suppose if you look at it in the context of contemporary British gangster films, it's pretty good - beer bellies replacing 'cool'; character replacing narrative; funny psychotic replacing tiresome psychotic. 
As a film that's been so praised, however, it's a little disappointing. There is no plot to speak of, beyond the bones of that old stand-by, a 'retired' gangster tries to stay out of the business, but his past catches up on him, and he is forced to accept One Last Job.  In narrative terms, this takes up about ten minutes of the film.  So, what's left?  Character?  Gal is one of the rare figures in the gangster genre - someone who's made it, who's achieved the (British) dream and made enough money to escape grimy, long-faced England, and shack up in sun-blanched Spanish solitude in a fantasy villa/hashee-yendah.  Where American gangsters are obsessed, and eventually consumed, by power, the British gangster just wants to get out, as in the most famous example, Ronnie Biggs.  But this is a gangster FILM, and there are generic demands, one of which is that crime doesn't pay, if not legally, than morally, in terms of conscience.  But Gal doesn't have any moral scruples - his nightmares concern the immediate threat to his well-being.  But if the gangster hero is proven in action, than Gal fails miserably.  He allows himself, his wife and his friends be humiliated by the preposterous Malky, receiving without complaint violence on his person and his possessions.  When the crisis comes to a head, and violent exorcism is demanded by the narrative, Gal and his strutting boyfriend are found wanting and impotent; it is his wife who sorts things out.  this is fascinating and original, as we watch Gal exfoliating, as a man and a gangster, made flabby by the good life, rotten by the sun.  Like all gangsters, he is a man who tries to order chaos, the arbitrary, by fixing patterns.  The boulder and Malky are hurtling dei (sic?) ex machina who rupture the peaceful order of his life; rather than let them stand as examples of the Absurd intruding on existence, he ties them together, gives them a purpose.  This is mirrored in the form, which, despite the violence, divisions, visual instability, strives to connect - character, dialogue, time, place.  The set-piece of Malky recounting the plan, weaving together a variety of voices, interests, locations and time-periods, is a case in point.  Add another ten minutes.The rest is an oppressive battery of narcissistic stylistic tics, a series of ads without products (well, mostly...) that serve little purpose beyond padding out a thin plot.  Even Guy Ritchie is more economical with ad flashiness than this.  Maybe if I hadn't known the director was a celebrated ad-man, I mightn't have noticed, but it's all so hollow and wearing, especially when compared to the underrated 'Gangster No.1' (also directed by an adman).  Thank goodness for Ben Kingsley, in an extraordinary, bizarre, incongruous performance.  People have called his small-statured logorrheic violence Pinteresque, but it's Pinter performed by 'the Fast Show', odd, silly, and very, very funny.",Sexy Beast
58,moviesleuth2,See it for Kingsley and Winstone,7,7 June 2010,"Some of the best movies are ones where we can simply watch brilliant acting and listen to electric dialogue. In these movies, plot is of little to no importance. ""Sexy Beast"" is clearly in this category, and what makes it so watchable is the brilliant performances by Ray Winstone and especially Ben Kingsley.Gal (Ray Winstone) is a career criminal who has retired to Spain, living a life of luxury with his beautiful wife DeeDee (Amanda Redman). Life is great, but then his friends, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White) get a call from from Don Logan (Ben Kingsley). Don arrives the next day to get Gal to come out of retirement and do another job. Gal declines, but the psychotic Don won't take no for an answer.As good as the script is (and it's very good), where ""Sexy Beast really shines is the performances. Ray Winstone is doing a nice change of pace as a sympathetic ex-criminal. Winstone, who has been known to play villains of the worst kind (like Dad in ""The War Zone,"" for example) is very effective in the role. It's not necessarily the fear of getting caught that makes him reluctant to do the job, it's the fact that he just want to done with that life. But both he and Don know that money was never an object in their life of crime; it was the adrenaline rush they got from doing it. And that kind of a reaction is hard to turn down. Then there's Ben Kingsley, who is completely arresting as Don. ""Psychotic"" doesn't do him justice. This is a guy who would beat someone to death at the blink of an eye and go right back to his drink as if nothing had happened. There isn't a single moment that Kingsley is on screen and he doesn't command our absolute attention. Ian McShane is also quite good as the creepy mastermind behind the heist, Teddy Bass. I was reminded of Christoph Waltz in ""Inglorious Basterds"" in the way that he seems to know everything, but plays dumb. It's a creepy effect, and McShane is adept at utilizing his facial features to emphasize this.When I realized that this was directed by Jonathan Glazer, whose next film was ""Birth,"" a creepy and haunting psychological thriller that was ruined mostly by inept direction, I had my doubts about this movie. Never fear, however, because they are nothing alike. It's a little on the long side (even at a skinny 89 minutes), and there are a few too many directorial flourishes that call attention to themselves too much, but for the most part, the film is well directed.This isn't an action movie, but for those who like outstanding acting and strong dialogue, it's well worth your time.",Sexy Beast
59,Eumenides_0,Ben Kingsley Saves Half The Movie,7,27 February 2010,"Sexy Beast is a crime movie that offers little in terms of innovation or even basic entertainment. It's conventional, predictable. There's some playing around with editing and time, but otherwise it's conventional.If there is a reason to watch this movie, it's this: Ben Kingsley.Ben Kingsley, in perhaps his best role of the past ten years, plays Don Logan, a cruel, violent, abusive London gangster whose name alone inspires fear. When Gal (Ray Winstone), a retired safe-cracker living in Spain, learns that Don is coming over to offer him a job, he begins panicking; his wife begins panicking; his friends begin panicking. Don Logan is bad news.When Don arrives, he shows them they have every reason to be afraid: he wants Gal for a job and won't take no for an answer. He has no respect for people, no fear, no social skills. He's an abrupt, intimidating bastard. And Ben Kingsley plays him wonderfully. This type of acting has had its imitators: watch Ralph Fiennes in In Bruges, or Alec Baldwin in The Cooler, and see how far the image of Don Logan has reached in modern tough gangsters.The movie fizzles whenever Kingsley isn't present, which is about one half of the movie. Just his presence makes the movie interesting, even his silences and fixed staring are fascinating. He's like a time bomb about to detonate, and he acts like he's about to detonate at any time.Winstone and the rest of the cast are alright, but they don't have the charisma to carry an uninteresting heist movie. A heist movie lives or dies by the originality (or far-farfetchedness) of the heist, of the way it's pulled off: is is going to be slick and cool like in Ocean's Eleven? Or silent and professional like in Rififi and The Red Circle? Will the criminals have cool gimmicks, like in The Thomas Crown Affair or The Taking of Pelham 123? Sexy Beast never lives up to the level of these movies. The heist proves to be banal and simple, the preparation, which is one of the main aspects of heist movies, is overlooked. In the end the movie is a flawed movie enjoyable because of one great performance. I'm sad to see that this movie is so forgotten today, for everyone should do themselves a favor and watch Ben Kingsley in this.",Sexy Beast
60,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: a little too arty for me,5,4 August 2002,"Sexy Beast is a crime thriller where all of the emphasis is on characterization rather than the crime itself. Although I'm an action movie guy, I do have an appreciation for that. Ben Kingsley is really great and I can see why he won an Academy Award nomination for his role.Unfortunately, the film was a little too slow-paced for me. Everyone's a bad guy, so it's difficult to identify with and root for the protagonist. I found the ""troubled soul"" metaphor a little heavy handed. And finally, the production value wasn't polished, so the lighting and audio quality were lacking. That made it tough for me, as an American, to understand the dialogue at moments, since the characters all had thick accents.Who should see this film:-- action movie buffs, but only on a rainy day-- drama film buffs? I'm not sure about you. See ""Death and the Maiden"" first, a better Ben Kingsley film.I'll give Sexy Beast a so-so 5 out of 10.",Sexy Beast
61,christophe92300,Quite intriguing,5,12 September 2013,"Sexy Beast is one of those movies that are hard to judge, at the end of which you are not sure whether you liked it or hated it.For an hour, there is succession of intriguing scenes, calibrated for Ben Kingsley excellent as a totally crazy gangster, but a bit too redundant and sometimes as oppressive as the sun of Spain. Then, the script takes a much more conventional turn, and even though those last 25 minutes revive the interest for the movie, it remains very basic.All in all, Sexy Beast has no big flaw and is overall rather enjoyable, but ultimately, we are under the impression nothing much happened during this 1h25, which by the way doesn't pass that quickly.A second viewing is necessary.",Sexy Beast
62,ruby_fff,A gem of a gangster film - refreshing for mature audience appreciation,7,21 July 2001,"Ben Kingsley is Don Logan. Period. He delivered this role as perfect and complete as his Shakespearean characters. So earnest he is in portraying this gangster supreme that he does not need the prop of a gun - his mouth is THE gun shooting off bullets of cutting words, F words non-stop, and delivering right in your face without a bat or a blink of his eyes. Shamelessly brilliant! He impeccably made everyone immediately hates Don.
Must not forget Ray Winstone as Gary Dove, the other half of the equation in this earnestly dramatic, yet cleverly entertaining crime film directed by Jonathan Glazer. Always seem so effortless in his portrayals, Winstone's characters to-date are mostly intense, underneath his physical façade and unaffecting facial expressions, there are secret motives and excruciating dilemma. It's fascinating to watch him act (and react.)
This is a formidable debut from director Glazer. It's a mature adult gangster film, not the 'Snatch' light and fun kind. It takes itself seriously: the story substance, the plot twists and turns, the characters (including the supporting ones) are well-written, well-acted by all, down to the boy who helps Gary with his (swimming) pool chores. It's also a good-looking film - how can Costa del Sol in Spain be unattractive, or the underneath world of London not intriguing? With Ian McShane appearing as the cold gangster boss, that's icing (pardon the pun) on the cake. Amanda Redman is Gary's lovely yet assertive wife Deedee, whom he adores and would do anything for love and their survival from the crime-world mess. They do want to get away from it all alive and retire happily ever after, don't they? Just have to 'dissolve' this sticky Don situation. How far can one bluff one's way through such threatening entanglements?  SEXY BEAST delivers. With a fantastic script by Louis Mellis, director Glazer achieved what he wanted: a non-formulaic, highly entertaining, satisfying crime film. Definitely appreciation by a mature audience.",Sexy Beast
63,Spanner-2,weird,6,11 March 2002,This is a weird film that benefits from a strong supporting turn by Ben Kingsley as a derranged mob guy. The film itself was a tad too oddball for my tastes and the accents were often hard to understand. GRADE: C+,Sexy Beast

65,MattBrady099,Jonathan Glazer you Sexy Beast,9,7 February 2015,"Don ""Malky"" Logan: ""I love you, Gal. You're lovable. Big lovable bloke.""The story is about a former gangster who has made a modest amount of money from his criminal career. Happy to put his life of crime behind him, he has retired with his wife Deedee (Amanda Redman) to the sunny bliss of rural Spain, where he lives an idyllic life with his family and a few close friends. But Gary's contentment is ruptured by an unwelcome visitor from his past -- Don (Ben Kingsley), a former associate who has been hired to assemble a team of criminals to rob a heavily guarded bank. Don wants Gary in on the job, and is less than pleased by Gary's unwillingness to volunteer his services. What ensues is a battle of wills between the two men, with Don intimidating, prodding, and manipulating his onetime friend to get what he wants, forever changing the lives of those around him in the process.Jonathan Glazer seems to be like one of those directors that only direct's movies if he really wants to put in his pure passion, his soul and effort to do so, and how I know that is by looking at his other two movies that he made so far and those two movies have proved that he takes time with filming and he only picks the films that's right for him. Sexy Beast is another great example of that.Ray Winstone may play the same character in every movie that his in. Playing the tough angry British guy in every movie his in, but in this that's not the case, he actually played a character...wow. Ray Winstone is a good actor and I do like him has a person and I'm happy that he's in a movie that shows his talent. Great work Winstone.Ben Kingsley in this movie probably pulls off his best performance that I've seen him in. He plays the loud month guy that dose you head in and in a strange way I kind of like him, even when I shouldn't, it's like J.K Simmons in Whiplash where in that movie you got Fletcher a mean, ass-hole who you just want to hit but at the same time kind of like him and not fully hate him, and that's basically Kingsley in this movie. Kingsley is always brilliant in every movie but in this I think he really dose shine and in my opinion it's my favorite performance from him.Now for problems: My only little nick pick with this movie is the that in some scenes in this movie that was a little bit slow and that's it really.Overall Sexy Beast is a movie that's acted well, directed and shot beautifully and overall a well done film.

There is absolutely nothing even remotely good about this film. ...On second thought, strike that. There is absolutely nothing even remotely good about this film, except the acting performance of Ben Kingsley. That stellar performance (he is really frightening and actually oozes psychopathy from all pores) is however not enough to redeem a movie that has no story, no script, no sensible dialog, nothing whatsoever to capture the viewers attention. The film simply doesn't make any sense, it is centered on nothing and isn't going anywhere.Probably another one of those 'artistic masterpieces' I am simply too stupid to understand.

Like the also vastly overrated The Score, the film features supposedly brilliant criminal masterminds who behave rather stupidly.SPOILERS. Gangster thug Kingsley goes to Spain to browbeat a retired crony into doing ""one last job."" But he goes to see him three days before the actual heist, even though the robbery as been in the planning stages for four months. Why is this guy so vital to the plan? That isn't clear and becomes less clear when we see the robbery. He appears to be of no more importance than anyone else involved in the break in. Plus, the robbery makes no sense. Flooding the vault? Wouldn't that short out the security system and set off alarms? Wouldn't the water damage or destroy a lot of the valuables in the safety deposit boxes? And won't the gapping whole in the vault leading to the bathhouse lead the police directly to the people behind the robbery? Take away the ludicrous heist, a small part of the film anyway, all you have is Kingsley's overbearing attempt to become a Cockney Joe Pesci. And that is a mighty meager goal in itself. Kingsley's too good to waste his time - and ours - with such junk.",Sexy Beast
70,majikstl,Stunningly awful,1,22 December 2001,"This is a tiresome bore of a movie that goes nowhere, albeit with a lot of sound and fury aimed at nothing of value. The film reminds me of that Monty Python skit where they argue about whether they are arguing: ""yes we are - no we're not - yes we are - no we aren't, etc."" It's funny for a few seconds, but becomes moronic when drug out to over an hour: ""You will rob this bank"" - ""no I won't"" - ""yes you will."" If such a lame conflict is to power a motion picture, the ensuing conversation had better be imbued with wit, charm, style and/or tension -- all commodities sadly missing from this insipid mess. And after enduring such banality, the viewer had better be rewarded with some sort of finale that will, at the very least, amuse. Instead we get a ""big heist"" that is utterly ludicrous and not even particularly daring. And we also realize that the protagonist needed for this ""one last job"" is totally unnecessary, making everything that proceeds the climax totally irrelevant. The actors fall prey to the great fallacy of method: ""If I screech loud enough, then I must be doing great acting!"" Their work is - to put it kindly - embarrassing, but at least they put forth an effort, which is more than can be said for the writer and director. The film's one and only asset is the provocative title, which is utterly wasted on film that uses it to mislead the viewer with false expectations.",Sexy Beast
71,Rockwell_Cronenberg,"Uneven, but the performances make it.",5,21 December 2011,"Sexy Beast was a lot different than I expected, but that's probably a good thing. I was expecting a standard British crime film with with great performances, but while I got the latter it definitely wasn't anything standard. The tone was very unique, but also all over the place. It would go from this '80s pop heist movie to a staged character drama to a quiet noir tone, it never really felt like it was comfortable in it's skin. A common occurrence with a first time director, trying to do too many things in one go. Some of this stuff worked, I dug any scene with the characters being still and interacting, but some of it really didn't; the supernatural element was so bizarre and unnecessary.Ultimately it's all about the performances though and they really leave a mark. Ray Winstone's character wasn't one I had much of an investment in, but I always love when people give that guy the opportunity to really dig into something. He's got so much talent and he's usually stuck in the background. Of course it's Ben Kingsley who steals the show with one of the most explosive, terrifying and intimidating performances I've seen in some time. He completely steals the movie and is the thing that resonated the most for me. A wild performance.Ian McShane is really under-appreciated here though, also quite intimidating but in a polar opposite way from Kingsley; a quiet menace. McShane does his best, but the film suffers a lot whenever Kingsley isn't on screen. That's the problem with a supporting performance that takes center stage; everything else pales in comparison. Also, for an 80-minute running time, it dragged a bit in the final act.",Sexy Beast
72,gary-444,Uneasy Mix of the Brilliant and absurd,5,13 February 2007,"A friend who is a Lecturer in Film Studies had urged me to see this - I duly did, but with very mixed feelings afterwards.On the positive side an impressive cast , led by a demonic, psychotic Ben Kingsley, seize an innovative, provocative script which is narrative driven, Pulp Fiction style.The strong London accents and vernacular will make this a struggle for non-native English speakers to understand. The crude, profane, mobster, Don Logan - brilliantly portrayed by Kingsley - dominates the proceedings, with an ugliness which borders on the unwatchable.Ray Winstone as Gal, the ""retired"" crook being cajoled to do one last heist, seems to have built a career on gangster stereotypes since he exploded onto the screen as a borstal boy in ""Scum"". He gives a comparatively sensitive, thoughtful, performance aided and abetted by Amanda Redman in a convincing cameo role as his wife. A mysterious pool boy, Enrique, flits in and out of proceedings leaving you guessing whether he is offering ""other services"" to the rich and indolent.There are some tremendous set pieces between Winstone and Kingsley as Logan refuses to take ""no"" for an answer.And a scene where Logan decides that aeroplane's no smoking policies don't apply to him is a powerful tour de force.On the negative side, the heist itself is poorly portrayed and ultimately becomes a bit of a mess. It is almost as if the Director realises that the dialogue alone isn't going to hold the film and so throws in some bangs and drama for effect. Ian McShane has a bizarre cameo role as part of the London Team with a performance that teeters between comic and convincing.Worth a look, but a million miles away from ""Lock Stock"" ""Snatch"" ""Long Good Friday"" etc, and for a British gangster double hander look no further than Terence Stamp in ""The Hit""",Sexy Beast
73,smakawhat,"Wonderful character portrayls, in a crime film",8,24 August 2001,"Ray Winstone has to be one of my favorite actors.  He is a big intimidating SOB who has played some evil people in his acting life such as the alcoholic wife abusing husband in 'Nil By Mouth' and the abusive father in Tim Roth's 'The War Zone'.  With that being said, I never thought I could ever see him cower in fear and find someone more intimidating on screen than him.  In this film, it is all Ben Kingsley in what has to be the most memorable performance I have seen this year period.Ray Winstone is Gal, a retired criminal who does nothing better than sunning himself all day by the pool, drinkin beer, eating well, and living with his wife which he loves so much.  It's the perfect life.  But his world is rocked when he suddenly hears that an old friend is coming to town to ask him to one last job.  For Gal it isn't so much what he is being asked to do, it is who is doing the asking, an ireprehensible man named Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) a Cockney hard wired psychopath that you don't say no to.All of Gal's friends are mortified that he is coming to visit, and the mention of his name just strikes fear into everyone with perhaps the exception of Gal's wife DeeDee since she justs detests him so much.  It's amazing just to watch Gal break down when Logan arrives.  At first he tells his wife he will just say No he doesn't want to do it.  But it becomes apparant from Logan's ravenous antics that he just can't, he ends up making excuses that he is too old, or he's not the same anymore, fidgiting and second guessing himself in Logan's presence.Logan is amazing on screen, even reciting his diatribes in the mirror while shaving just so he can demean every living person he comes across.  What Sexy Beast ends up doing is not creating the greatest crime thriller ever made, but generating one heck of acting grandiose between Kingsley and all the other players involved.  You don't care so much about the plot, but more on how everyone reacts to Logan and what he's going to do next.Director Johnathan Glazer does follow alot of the same stylized Guy Ritchie type motif such as in Lock Stock 2 Smoking Barrels and Snatch, but it's a stylized entertaining picture none the less.

The idea of Kingsley portraying an intense, relentlessly badgering criminal driven to blind rages is an appealing one and it should be great cinema but, as fun as it is, it doesn't work: you can't get past the fact that it's Ben Kingsley playing against type, that he's a great technician, that he's always acting. Meanwhile, Winstone is completely convincing, subtly juggling heavy mixtures of love, fatigue and sorrow and continually finding new ways to connect to his friends and family (all of whom are excellent, especially Amanda Redman playing his wife with a past) and the audience. The film is directed by Jonathan Glazer making his debut and the hysterics that surround the Buddha-like Winstone are clearly patterned after Danny Boyle and Martin Scorsese with no discernible personal style; like Kingsley, he appears intent on nothing so much as making a splash.",Sexy Beast

78,tnrcooper,"Excellent, very well-acted, taut movie",9,2 February 2007,"This is a movie about a man who wants a life (Gal, played with commendable understatement by Ray Winstone) and another man who doesn't have one (Ben Kingsley as the out-of-control psychopath Don Logan) and so wants to inflict his misery on everyone around him. I saw one of the comment threads at the bottom of this page asking the question, is Don the worst character in movie history? I haven't seen every movie, but he'd have to be up there. I've never seen such fear from other characters, so simply and rawly depicted as when Gal and his wife Deedee (Amanda Redman, again, very well-acted as a good time girl who has probably had some bad things happen to her, but who seems to have found happiness with her husband) walk into a restaurant for what they expected to be a pleasant casual meal with his good friend and cohort in their former lives as crooks, Ted (Ian McShane, playing a tough who is really really afraid of Don) and his wife. Don and Deedee enter the restaurant and walk toward the table where Ted and his wife sit still and ashen-faced. They are not moving and seem ready to revert to the fetal position at a moment's notice. Ted received a phone call from Don who wants Gal to do one more job.Few people in life could elicit the pale, fearful responses which Don has from Ted and his wife. Redman as Deedee, and Gal to a lesser degree, betray mortal fear at receiving word from Ted at the phone call Ted got. Deedee's display of mute fear is an admirable depiction of fear which freezes and renders the mind and body still, although we later find out she had another reason to fear Don. That said, Gal is not easily cowed. He doesn't want anything to do with the criminal life. He has served time in jail and now has a quiet life in Spain with his wife. He doesn't want to risk his hard-won pleasures for a job, no matter how big. He might be as scared as Ted, but he refuses to show it.Essentially, this film comes down to a battle of wills between Don, played as a terse, poorly-dressed, stubborn, although unable to persuade friends, psychopath who, if his initial overtures are rejected, will simply badger insistently, either till his target agrees in order that he will stop hectoring, or simply out of fear of the consequences of failing to co-operate.Gal is also quietly insistent though. He has been in trouble before and he has decided his wealth and happiness are not worth squandering on one more hit. Without giving away what happens, this is a very well-acted and compact movie. The director has obviously informed his actors quite clearly on their motivations and the talented cast deliver sturdy, professional performances, reflecting their desire to live quietly and peacefully in their remote house in Spain.Kingsley was aptly praised for his original presentation of a truly heinous, bullying, venal...and surprisingly poorly dressed, character. However Winstone as the quietly determined Don was not so recognized. In my eyes, he might have had the tougher job, depicting a grimly determined quiet man who does not want to rejoin the criminal life.

79,talisencrw,Excellent debut film for director Glazer!,9,31 August 2016,"The other day, my lady Tammy and I watched director Glazer's recent 'Under the Skin' and loved its otherworldly wackiness and ambiance, and as I had his first two films on DVD, we decided that at the very least, this first one demanded immediate investigation. I've adored Ray Winstone's work since his early days working in the films of Sir Alan Clarke, and Ben Kingsley's always a treat. Watching the characters brought back such awesome memories of my teenage days, traveling throughout England and continental Europe in December, 1986, as well. We can't wait to hopefully check out 'Birth' later this week...This was definitely one of the best and most original British gangster movies since the likes of 'The Long Good Friday' and 'Mona Lisa' from that era...",Sexy Beast
80,cordenw,Great movie but cockney accents make it almost unintelligible,9,30 July 2014,"I've been away from England too long now! I can just about decipher scouse accents , because that's where I come from but the cockney twitter is like some obscure foreign language to me... They would have been 100% justified in adding subtitles for the North American market, it's no wonder it didn't do so well over here. And it's a pity it didn't, because it's a fabulous movie, with Ben Kingsley the polar opposite of his Gandhi role. He is a menacing,evil, foul mouthed psychopath and so convincing that I wouldn't want to meet him in the street. Ray Winstone is a great foil for him, a typical, likable cockney tea leaf. Every role in this movie is played to perfection and the tension created in some of the scenes takes you right to the edge of snapping point. The undercurrent is a message that tells you that true love has no judgement and that a misspent past life doesn't preclude you from a happy future life. Ian McShane is absolutely superb in conveying a different sort of evil, the evil that is just born into a person who exists only to gratify himself ....just chilling. London Gangland movies have a different quality to them when compared with American stories, you get the texture of the class struggle and the depth of the intellect of the gangsters. If it's done well, like this one is, you root for some of the bad guys even though you know they're crooks. Very enjoyable movie you should try to watch it.",Sexy Beast

82,Afracious,Better than the usual mediocre English crime flicks,9,7 August 2001,"Gal (Ray Winstone) is a retired crook now residing in Spain with his wife Deedee (Amanda Redman). He likes to spend his time shooting rabbits and relaxing in the blazing sun at the side of his pool, that is until a huge boulder comes crashing down a hill and lands in it. Gal's idyllic life is interrupted when a bloke from his criminal past phones his friend and tells him he will be soon paying Gal a visit. The bloke in question is Don Logan (played menacingly by Ben Kingsley). Don is a frightening psychopathic figure. In one scene a man asks Don to put his cigarette out and Don replies, ""I'll cut your hands off and stub it out on your eyeball"". We first see Don walking through an airport (a scene not unlike when we first see Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday). On Don's arrival at Gal's villa, not many words are spoken. Don asks Gal to come to London to do a bank job with his firm. Gal declines, but Don won't take no for an answer. Eventually, Gal must go and do the job. There are some dream sequences where Gal is sat at a dinner table in the desert and Don appears in the shape of a human rabbit, shooting a machine gun at him. The film has a sort of romantic theme with Gal and his wife, and the theme of this enormous ogre that must be overcome. Winstone is as solid as ever playing a cockney crook, but it's Kingsley who (not surprisingly) stands out with his manic turn. It's stylishly shot and a film well worth seeing, and it doesn't outstay its welcome with its running time of just 84 minutes.",Sexy Beast

The photography and music were spectacular. However, being that it was an all british sounding cast, when you did not see them directly most of the audience could not understand what they were saying. They had a bit too much of an english accent and that hurt some of the movie. The storyline was good and different to say the least.  I felt it just didn't meet my expectations and my wife and I generally like everything. This fell a bit short.",Sexy Beast

(in fact most of the cast perfectly capture the feel of east end uncultured trash basking in the Spanish sun)don spends most of his time slating 'gal' about his weight and orange leathery complexion... some of the lines are perfect gold dust. in fact don lays in to just about everyone. the sections of the movie that do not contain don feel a little empty in comparison, but the film does tie up nicely to a good quality finalethere are some great visuals on offer here, and i also liked the thumping no compromise soundtrack. this movie absolutely does not try to be sophisticated (unlike ritchies efforts), and it is a better movie for it. give it a whirl. and if you didn't get the dialogue, watch it again with subtitles before posting your disappointment on IMDboverall this movie is far more authentic than ritchies contrived efforts, esp for realism (shotgun wielding man rabbits aside..)",Sexy Beast

Yeah, the same old, same old. Ben Kingsley is the glue that holds this tissue-thin trope, I mean 'plot', together, and hell, the movie is almost worth it just for ""He touched me front, me front bottom"", along with that (completely random) dream sequence (I doubt that was the sort of 'Bunnyman' Echo had in mind) that still has us going WTF? 20 years later, and that ending as well. Apart from that, it's all safely familiar boiler-plate heist fare that has them flooding the bank or something, I don't remember the details, but with this sort of movie, they tend not to matter.

87,DanB-4,Ben Kingsley's Movie,8,29 March 2002,"This is an undefinable film, probably best described as a gangster movie. I would not use the word comedy at all. But what it really is is a showcase for Ben Kingsley, who leaps from Ghandi to Meyer Lansky Itzhak Stern to Don Logan, a psychopathic gangster that brought to mind Joe Pesci of Goodfellas.Sexy Beast is all about mood, style, characters and conversation. It is at its heart a love story, the love of Gal (Ray Winstone) and his wife DeeDee. Both have skeletons in their closets - Ray is retired career criminal and DeeDee is a former Porn Star. All they want out of life is solitude. They are happy, until Don Logan (Kingsley) pops back in to their lives to offer Ray a job. About one third of the film is Logan not taking ""no"" for an answer, without every growing a tiny bit tedious.Kingsley is amazing and should have won the Oscar. He sits on edge, almost at attention, talks in constant babble, swears almost poetically (although he reprimands Gal for swearing) and is focused clearly on his task. In one of the DVD extra features, Kingsley decribes his character as someone who, at the flip of a coin, could have just as easily become a cop.This is not a movie for the faint of heart (some violence and non-stop profanity), and to be honest, I had a very tough time getting through the accents. (I watched twice, the first time with the subtitles on). A strongly recommended rental if for nothing else, seeing Ben Kingley demonstrate one of the greatest ranges in acting history. ***1/2 out of ****.",Sexy Beast
88,amosduncan_2000,For Those Who Find Implausibility a Turn On SPOILERS,2,15 October 2014,"This type of Brit Noir was just coming into vogue when ""Sexy Beast"" came out; though I find it sort of a cross between ""The Hit"" and one of those dumb things by Madonna's ex husband. A clever touch here and there, but this is a woefully overrated film. I guess if you can understand how Spanish Airport security would be intimidated by an absolutely ridiculous claim of sexual molestation from an obvious lunatic, well, this is your movie. Not much else here is more credible than that, from the heist of the super villain of the impenetrable fortress which obviously lacks the most basic alarm system. Super ruthless, powerful bad guy shows up at your door in the middle of the night? Sure, let him in, he probably won't kill you. Kingsley's celebrated performance is fine but he's been better elsewhere. No fault can really be found with any of the cast. Often Noir is concerned with the desperate lives of the hopeless people who turn to crime. This is sort of an interesting wrinkle on that, though we are never really told just what Gal's hapless buddy did, and how such a person could have been much of a criminal in the first place.",Sexy Beast
89,Hawkensian,"A paced, gripping British thriller with visual flair.",8,9 August 2012,"On face value, 'Sexy Beast' may appear to be yet another pustulent addition to the bloated, adolescent British gangster genre, however it's far from that, it's up there with 'The Long Good Friday'. 'Sexy Beast' is one of the most accomplished films I've seen in a while, it has no noticeable flaws. It's a taut, paced and stylish thriller that exhibits tight narrative control, making the most of its simple yet wholly engaging premise in an effortlessly flowing non-linear fashion.Ray Winstone was deservedly introduced to the world stage with his role as Gal, a humble Londoner who's living the dream and has everything to lose. The plot is a simple, familiar one. Gal has found happiness in his paradisiacal Spanish villa, but his perfect life is ruptured when Don Logan, a figure from his old life, returns to make a job offer. Even before Don appears at the villa, it's clear that it's not an 'offer'; it's an obligatory matter, a grand heist that's been tailored for Gal by the shadiest of the London underworld, he dare not turn it down. Despite Gal being a former criminal, he is a sympathetic character, the viewer can empathise with him, with his desire to leave the filth of London and be on the 'straight and narrow'. This film was also important for Ben Kingsley, his performance as Don Logan showing that he can be both Ghandi and a foul-mouthed psychopath.Contrary to the norm, Kingsley is the villain here, not Ray Winstone; the vicious, unpredictable Don Logan subjects Gal to mind games that quickly turn violent. Kingsley is entirely convincing in this role of aggression and violence, he is the most versatile of actors. The course of events are tense, sinister and unforeseeable. Not a minute of its running time is wasted; it's a top notch crime thriller that ought to be regarded as a great of British cinema.",Sexy Beast

94,Captain Ed,"Kingsley is outstanding, but slow and not too involving",7,28 May 2003,"""Sexy Beast"" is an unusual film -- a good thing these days -- but outside of a terrific performance by Ben Kingsley, there really isn't a lot here to recommend.  The story is an odd take on the 'retired thief being brought back for one last job' cliche, but it's intriguing: this guy REALLY doesn't want to unretire.  Kingsley, playing world-class psychopath Don Logan, is sent to Spain to convince Gal to return to England.**SPOILERS**Unfortunately, Gal's wife blows Logan away after a day of physical and psychological abuse, and so in order to cover up the fact that Logan was killed, Gal has to go do the job.  Logan's brutal murder is mostly told in flashback while Gal is working on the job, and that works pretty well.  The problem is that the job itself is uninteresting (and staged in an uninteresting manner), and outside of Teddy Banks, the mastermind (nicely played by Ian McShane), nobody on the job is interesting at all.  Gal suffers few consequences for his actions, even though Teddy is insistent on getting the truth from Gal.Anyway, it's not a bad film, just not terribly engaging outside of the performances of Kingsley and McShane.  Ray Winstone as Gal is all right, but like the rest of the movie, a bit bland.  I gave it a seven for Kingsley and McShane -- it's worth a rental.Oh, and someday, I hope to get an explanation of the title.

All about how a former, he says, retired, criminal is urged or made to participate in a robbery attempt...not a new plot by any means.

Here in Britain the Cockney gangster flic is such an established genre that we seem to receive an offering almost daily.'Sexy Beast' is, in my opinion, not a bad effort all things considered and is genuinely a cut above the average London gangster flick. I thought the screenplay was quite good - a mix of thriller, love story & character study. The dramatic confrontations between Logan (Kingsley) and Gal (Winstone) were almost theatrical. perhaps highlighting the stage background of Mellis & Scinto - they wrote the play on which 'Gangster No 1' was based.The film is well acted, particularly Ray Winstone in the more understated role as opposed to Kingley's OTT psychopath. Winstone's associated with hard men roles but also as an actor who can display the vulnerability behind their bravado. Also nice to see Ian McShaneon screen again.The direction was fast paced perhaps indicating Glazer's background in adverts and the pumping soundtrack, his background in music promos. I liked the way the film was edited, particularly the scene where the action shifts from a dramatic poolside confronatation to Gal sudeenly in London. It kept you interested in what happened in the intervening time.
Perhaps I'm odd but what about the orgy scene. Did James Fox's upper class character do to the gangster Teddy Bass what I think he did. What did it signify? Being Britain, no film would be typically English without some reference to class.I sympathise with US reviewers who find the accents and London colloquial language difficult to understand. Its ironic that in the UK, we don't seem to have this problem with gangland pictures set in New York for instance, like the excellent 'Donnie Brasco'.Finally, I was sad to see the tribute to Cavan MacCarthy in the final credits.

The story is all about loyalty and betrayal, a two act story involving retired hood ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone), living the good life in a Spanish villa, he has it all, good friends, a good woman by his side, nothing could ruin this, that is until Don Logan (Ben Kingsly) arrives with a proposition.I'm not going to go into the second act, because it will only ruin the surprise of the film, all I can say is that Sexy Beast if top notch entertainment. The two main characters are fantastic, Winstone's subtle performance has been overlooked by most, possibly down to Kingsly's terrifying portrayal of Logan, who would have thought he could be so electrifying, the scene where he talks to himself in the mirror is brilliant. But Winstone is just as good; you can almost smell his fear.The rest of the characters are slightly under developed, Ian McSahne's crime lord Teddy Bass is practically a caricature of every London hood that's ever been portrayed. But first time director Jonathan Glazer makes up for that with his assured handling of the actors and the material, never letting his pop promo roots (Radiohead, Blur) take over the story.

I cannot believe this is the same guy who played Ghandi and Itzak Stern in Schindlers List. Kingsley is pure genius and electrifies the screen every time he's on. His character is evil incarnate and the famous scene on the plane is a MUST see. I'm also chuffed to bits to see Ray Winstone, at last, getting the quality role he's deserved for so long.

It plays such a pivotal part in underscoring Gal's (Ray Winstone) newly found idyllic lifestyle as a retired gangster soaking up the sun, the booze, and the so-called good life in Spain. Notice how the introductory violin ensemble with the accompanying Polynesian rhythms breaks into the twilight outdoor party scene immediately after the barbecue fire erupts, searing the meat on the grill (foreshadowing?). All of a sudden, a transformation, a Baptism of fire, if you will, occurs, taking us into the perceived good life that this former Cockney gangster has so diligently prepared for. Those few minutes of sheer ecstasy, if only temporary, are brilliantly punctuated by Mancini's lush score. The operative word here seems to be ""temporary"", as this fleeting moment of ecstasy is about to give way to a gritty reminder Gal's past life of ill gotten goods, in the form of Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), the quintessential beast. The remainder of the film is an excellent reprise into the realm of the ""one last job"" crime dramas and has been duly reviewed by many others listed above.",Sexy Beast

Flattered? Not if you're retired con man Gary 'Gal 'Dove and the boss is the sociopathic Don Logan.  And you thought your boss was the incarnation of the devil. Prepare for the worst when Don (Ben Kingsley) calls you out of your Spanish villa. You should have been suspicious when your first visitor is a huge rolling rock - not the brew -which drops metaphorically into your pool, landing on the mosaic tile linked hearts in its base - or am I being too obvious here? The director tries to bring this full circle by the end of the film and good luck to anyone following him there. The title Sexy Beast implies a physical appeal hidden under layers of a cushy retirement softness, which our hero seems to deny.  In reality, we are introduced to a sweaty beast sunning by poolside, a career British 'wise guy' who has tucked away a nest egg to support him and his wife and former porn queen, DeDee (Amanda Redmond) in style. His associate Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and his wife Jackie (Julianne White) are the perfect couple if your idea of perfection is Bill Sykes (Oliver) and Cruella Deville (Dalmatians). I haven't needed subtitles in an English language film so badly since Billy Elliott. Kingsley's articulate, but Gay lapses into the mumbles and Aitches lines are lost in complete gibberish. The dream sequences are so smoothly integrated to draw you into Gay's anxieties bringing his personal devil as a force he never completely overcomes. This hirsute phantom makes puzzling entrance but shows us that Gal's coolness under pressure has not been lost in his idleness. And he helps untie up a loose end before the final credits. You will find many other characters in this cast who stand up well to Kinsley's superior talent. Teddy's subtle portrayal of the Mr. Big earns the respect of his hired hands as well as the audience. We sympathize with the pathetic trophy wives when they incur the abuse of the psychopathic Don. Even the young pool boy shows an insight to the adult world without any cutesy pretense. Don's gives us the British Gangster Rap when he's up against the reluctant Gal. His staccato delivery of his disagreement (yesyesyesyesyesyes) and his forthright expression of his concern (""I won't let you be happy"") has an ominous rhythm that makes you want to agree to anything he demands. So have I dispelled any expectation of Ghandi reincarnated? Though the story line is as thin as Memento's, prepare to be blown away by a character whose demeanor, cadence and aura are so intimidating that you'll be comparing your next dozen nemeses to Don Logan, and seriously reconsider the advantages of a life of crime.CrCy",Sexy Beast
106,EdYerkeRobins,Multi-Layered Film with Excellent Performances,9,2 April 2002,"The title ""Sexy Beast"" is a grand misnomer.  There's only one beast in the movie and it's not very sexy at all.  Bad puns about the name aside, ""Sexy Beast"" successfully fuses elements of several different types of movies together with some brilliant performances and interesting direction.	Even the crew and actors behind the film are unsure of how to classify ""Sexy Beast"", and the film's spreading over multiple genres does make it a tad difficult.  At its heart it's a simple crime story, of an ex-con gone clean having to go back for one more job.  Though this basic theme is simple, built off of it are elements of romance (the love of an ex-con for his wife, who doesn't want him to do the job), suspense (ex-con doesn't want to do the job, other con has to convince him, through any means necessary), and even a few lines of comedy.  Unlike other films that try to blend multiple genres, ""Sexy Beast"" doesn't seem unbalanced at all; the comedy is so slight that it never overwhelms the serious aspects, and all else is built evenly off the main story.  The fact that the film is 90 minutes may seem worrisome on paper, but the film isn't too short and never feels rushed (a definite problem amongst good movies that are less than two hours).	Besides proper balancing, the film's multiple elements are able to work because of excellent leading performances.  Although his accent occasionally becomes so thick as to require closed captioning, Ray Winstone has great romantic chemistry with Amanda Redman and general chemistry with Ben Kingsley and other co-stars.  He comes off as a genuine good guy, who genuinely loves his life and wife and would never leave them.  When Kingsley's Don Logan gets into an angry confrontation, the atmosphere quickly becomes chilling, as his imposing nature overshadows his character's simple dialogue (such duality being the reason some have labeled the film a black comedy).  He also comes off as genuinely crazy, with enough screws loose that it's surprising when he becomes even more furious over the course of the film.  Yet even underneath such a hard shell, there are traces of a lacking self-confidence, which perhaps is what fuels his fire.  Kingsley brings such power and emotion to a character that essentially does nothing more than cuss throughout the entire movie.	The direction is also classy, leading to some interesting shots.  The most interesting of these is during a crashing one-boulder rockslide; as the boulder begins to roll, it is shot from the boulder's position, only to switch back to an oblivious Winstone, where the rock barely misses him and crashes into his swimming pool.  More excellent direction occurs in an underwater sequence later.  The only sequences that lack a true sense of belonging are those involving the film's titular beast; it is obvious the beast is a metaphor for something, but it's never made clear exactly what.

So how does a film end up this cool...by being slick you see. Slick contemporary cinematography that uses a few gimmicky tricks..but these are never over used. The narrative moves along briskly and in a linear fashion save for two decidedly non-linear sequences that are quite fun. The second of these sequences takes place in the final section of the film. This portion of the film is amazing as it managed to put me in the shoes of the protagonist in ways few films have ever been able to do...enjoyed this bit a great deal. Its impossible to talk about this movie and not talk about a force of nature I like to call Ben Kingsley. Im certain this man can walk on water and if he cant at the very least he gives one hell of a performance as the batnuts insane sociopath Don Logan. The perfect counter balance to Don would be Gal played by the coolest man on the planet Mr. Ray Winstone. One last thing...I absolutely adore the music in this film.",Sexy Beast

112,Doogie D,Pointless and overrated,3,22 July 2001,"I dunno.  My friend and I thought this was pretty pointless.  It's basically a character study, which is usually fine by me.  The movie started in a pretty unappetizing manner, and characters were introduced, and the dreaded ""Don"" (Kingsley) was referred to again and again with great dread.  Fine. In that vein, it goes on.  And on.  And on.  Finally Don arrives on the scene, and while he obviously could use an anger management course, it's not a true crisis.  So they argue and argue.  I'm assuming there's going to be quite a payoff, so I'm being patient.  About an hour in, I asked my buddy, ""Is this going anywhere?""    Finally, events occur or are revealed, there's an okay twist at toward the very end, and that's basically it. 
Now, I give a great big damn about character and nuance, and am willing to jettison a certain amount of structure for the sake of getting to know the people better.  Some of my favorite films are ""Diner,"" ""A Woman Under The Influence,"" ""Nashville,"" ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and ""sex, lies and videotape.""

I know that others love it, I get it, it's called having a different opinion. But I found this film inane, poorly paced, dull, idiotic, and didn't enjoy any of the performances - including Ben Kingsley's Oscar nominated performance. I found him totally dull and uninteresting. I love certain British crime movies so much: Mike Hodges' Get Carter, The Long Good Friday, with amazing performances by Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, mostly because the ensemble was so incredible and distinct, and older British crime films such as Brighton Rock (1947 version), The Blue Lamp (1950), etc.One of my problems with this movie was the poor casting choices of truly dull uninteresting actresses. I have never seen them in any other movies and I have seen thousands of British movies over the years.I found myself annoyed but I did watch the whole movie. There are only a few movies I couldn't make it all the way through (In the Loop I just couldn't make it past the first boring 45 minutes of it). This was a complete and total waste of my time. And yes, I know, others really love this movie somehow...",Sexy Beast
117,eddie052010,Should have gone straight-to-DVD.,6,18 November 2014,"By the years of 2000-2001, the crime genre was becoming a little stale. While directors like Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie had made the genre fresh again in the 90's, they had inspired many others who copied their unique style of film-making to a much lesser degree, creating many films which ranged from merely being bad (e.g. Best Laid Plans, The Big Hit) or were completely morally bankrupt (e.g. The Boondock Saints, Natural Born Killers). Because of this, it was easy to cynically prejudge many crime films that were coming out in that era. Occasionally however, you have exceptions to this rule which manage to stand out on their own and not fall into the trappings of crime films of that era, like L.A Confidential, Seven & The Usual Suspects. Unfortunately, despite what it's glowing reviews, box office figures and awards nominations may tell you, Sexy Beast isn't one of those films. While not being a complete disaster it is a very uninspired film that it is so safe and predictable that it feels more like a straight to DVD film rather than anything else.The plot is that a retired gangster, Gary Dove, is currently living a quiet life in Spain, with his wife and friends in a luxury villa. However, his peace is shattered when his former boss Don Logan abruptly arrives asking him to do one last job involving robbing one of London's most high tech banks. A conflicted Gary now has to decide whether to stay in peace and shelter or return for one last time into a dark underworld that might cost him dearly. The plot may sound very engaging at first, but it suffers from being utterly predictable, making the story lack any sort of tension or threat. It doesn't help that the heist isn't the movie's main focus, as most of the movie is spent focusing on the main character and how his decisions will affect those in the movie around him. While that does make the movie sound like an interesting character study, it isn't as there is little time focused on the main character's conflict, and rather is spent more time on Tarantino- esque conversations that don't advance the story much or Ben Kingsley's Don Logan, a character who seems entirely superfluous to the narrative, which considering how he takes up a lot of screen time is a major problem. The heist also suffers from the fact that the characters pull it off so easily and are unaffected by it's minimal consequences because of it, leading to a complete lack of tension in the process. This highlights the film's main problem: there is nothing at stake here, as the plot is so predictable and simple, the main heist of the film is so easy to pull off and NONE of the characters change at all by the end of the film as a result. This makes the film all the more pointless of an experience to watch because of it.However, there are some positive attributes that this movie has to offer. The film is at least very well-made and all of the cast work give great performances and the film at least has some style. Music video director Jonathan Glazer does the best he can with such bland material by giving the film look good, using some clever camera-work and has art-house touches here and there, particularly a demonic rabbit motif that looks like something out of the deleted scenes of Donnie Darko. All of these stylistic touches are great, making it look like Terry Gilliam directing a gangster movie, and it helps the film get some much-needed distinction. I just wish with material this generic, Glazer had tried to be more ambitious and risky and had made the film more art-house by cranking his Kubrick, Gilliam and Fincher influences up to 11, as it may have been more memorable film. Sure it may have been more pretentious, but at least I would have admired it more because of it for being ambitious. A film like Snatch for example that came out at a similar time tries to recapture the brilliant plotting of Pulp Fiction, but fails, becoming an incoherent mess in the process and proved that director Guy Ritchie was way out of his depth. While at least I could admire that movie for at least having ambition, Sexy Beast mostly lacks this and when it does try to be artistically challenging, you can tell there is a more provocative and compelling gangster flick in there struggling to get out. As it is though, this is your standard Tarantino-esque knock-off whose plot so safe and characters so uninteresting that there is nothing truly memorable about the film apart from a few scenes, making it feel like this should have stayed away from theaters and should have gone straight-to-DVD where it belongs. Sure it's nowhere near as bad as 44 Inch Chest (although few movies are that bad), which is from the same writers and features much of the same cast, as Sexy Beast is average rather than flat-out awful. It's clearly well-made, has a great cast and that director Jonathan Glazer has talent and shows potential for his future endeavors into film- making. However, it suffers from similar problems as 44 Inch Chest: it spends an hour focusing on pointless build-up, but fails to develop an interesting narrative or characters in that time and when the film gets to its main set-piece it is a major disappointment, making the viewing experience feel rather superfluous. Sure, while there are great performances and brilliant artistic touches here and there, all in all, this is just a safe and generic trope that despite its strong word of mouth should have gone straight-to-DVD, due to its lack trying to do anything innovative and experimental to a genre that by this point in time had run out of steam.",Sexy Beast

Welcome after the general stupidity of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and its imitators. Where the latter sees glamour and excitement in the gangster lifestyle, here Jonathan Glazer paints much more detail. So we get the ordinary fairly thick working class blokes caught up in crime combined with several powerfully convincing psychopaths who give Scorcese a run for his money in portraying the banality of evil.

Infuriating in that the dream sequences don't work, the underwater robbery feels rushed and the whole film probably needs an extra act. But, on the plus side, the film is a very English mix of Nicholas Roeg-like directing, Harold Pinter-like dialogue and Guy Ritchie-like cinematography and editing.Three scenes are an absolute standout. Firstly, a mountain top boulder tumbling and crashing into the Spanish villa swimming pool of expat cockney bank robber Gal (Ray Winstone), an event which sets in motion his reluctant return to crime. Second, a sensational Ben Kingsley as psycho Don Logan refusing to extinguish his cigarette on an air flight. And thirdly the sight of frogmen robbers cracking open the safety deposit boxes inside the London bank vault they've just flooded. Ray Winstone has never been more low-key before or since as the mellowed hard man who just wants to live in the sun quietly with his wife (Amanda Redman) and Kingsley is extraordinary in an Oscar-nominated role as a man incapable of restraining his rage - yet he is also very funny at one and the same time.",Sexy Beast

The film's title is a bit unfortunate, more having to do with the lead character's nightmares than to the plot.For those who don't easily understand heavy British accents (the character of Aitch - the mobster's friend, is particularly difficult to understand), I'd recommend waiting for the DVD and watching with English subtitles on.Not a great film, but Kinsley should be up for Best Supporting Actor at least. 8/10.",Sexy Beast

This film is more sinister than funny. When this film starts, you wonder whether it will be a heist film or not. The main characters are so content and happy living the life they are living, that returning to London and crime is out of the question. However, sometimes evil comes and it is hard to say no, By the way, evil has never been played more evil, since Dennis Hopper created Frank Booth in ""Blue Velvet.""

Which option offers the least likely chance?Sexy Beast was originally a stage play but manages to disguise its origins better than the over-rated Gangster Number One managed to.  This is mostly due to an excellent structure that includes a good use of flashbacks.  The dialogue is brilliant but it does cause some minor pacing problems at the villa as it might reveal character but it doesn't always move the story forward.  But to be honest I'm not sure if I could bring myself to edit it either.The main thing I learnt from the writing was how the writers added layers. With the characters it means Don isn't just in Spain to get Gal - he's there to get a gal. That paradox makes him much more interesting: tough but vulnerable.

And an unexpected icing on this particularly eclectic cake, i was very moved. It seems de-riguer to label Logan as the devil incarnate, bit in some senses winstone is the devil who wins out in the end more cunning (in a parochial way) than any of the many devils on display, even ian macshane's terrifying mob boss. as with under the skin, the narrative such as it is is merely a framework to quilt some amazing set-pieces ( and some jarring interruptions of utter mundainity such as winstone's gal waiting on a rain-soaked and colourless bus stop which could be anywhere in the antipodes to winstone's 'baking hot' Spanish villa. there is much here as well to place glazer into the same vaunted pantheon of film makers like Kubrick. these films do not take 10 years to make because of perfectionism unless perfectionism is knowing when the time is right to say a film is finished. After all kubrick's life-long deep passion for making AI and most notably the forever unmade Napoleon, are so distinct by being unmade they are more prefect to that which has been committed and reified using awkward clay. it seems i have been floated onto some netherworld between pretension and deep impacting emotional truth. such is the marker of a great work of art.

132,vinnieboards,You are going to have to turn this opportunity yes!,9,21 December 2010,"Have IMDb reviewers lost the plot. 7.1 star rating for Sexy Beast? You must be 'avin a larf'!! It's worth 9 stars purely for Ben Kingsley's show stopping portrayal of Don Logan who without question is the scariest hit-man to appear on the silver screen. If the TV show 'Ultimate Warrier' pitched Logan against Tommy DeVito of Goodfellas fame (another insane gangster played by Joe Pesci), Logan would finish him within seconds - a terrifying and unpredictable nut job in the best cinematic sense.This film is excellent throughout. If you can ignore the surreal 'rabbit in the burrow' moments which aren't really necessary, in essence Sexy Beast is a love story which is cruelly interrupted by the demands of the London underworld.Gal (Ray Winstone) and his wife (played by the excellent Amanda Redman) have moved to Spain, retiring Gal from his career as an expert safe cracker. Their idyllic life is shattered by the visit of Don Logan (Kingsley) who is looking to persuade Gal to do 'one last job' for underworld kingpin Teddy Bass (played by a wonderfully chilling Ian MacShane).And Logan isn't leaving without his man. I'm not a big fan of Ben Kingsley (anyone who insists on being called 'Sir' lacks a certain amount of humility), but as an actor he is certainly up there with the greats. Don Logan is a character he plays completely against type with a conviction and insanity which is terrifying at times and doesn't let up until he ends up as part of the permanent foundations of Gal's swimming pool.The real fear factor is not caused by Logan's constant swearing, aggression or violence - it's his total unpredictability which scares the hell out of you. Even when he starts talking to himself in the mirror, basically convincing himself that being turned down by Gal is not an option, it really does makes you nervous.So what is Sexy Beast? - a love story, a crime caper, a gangster movie? It's all of these and more. It's also a character study of villains and their molls. And with an excellent cast, clever editing and slick production, it is easy to disregard the certain flaws in this movie and recognise that it is a cracking piece of cinema.So if you are not going to take the opportunity to watch this film again, consider the wise words of Mr Don Logan...Gal: I am going to have to turn this opportunity down.

Undeniably, the best moments are at the villa when Don screams, curses, and demands Gal for assistance in his scheme. Also, the bank robbery and airport scene stand out. What hasn't been said about Ben Kingsley's portray as Don Logan? It's pure dynamite and is the main recommendation for watching this film. Ray Winstone gives a tough and discreet performance. Although Ben Kingsley and Ray Winstone provide stellar character portrayals, the film leaves a bad aftertaste. By bad aftertaste, I'm talking about the vicious sense of humor that is either an asset or hindrance to anyone viewing this film. To me, I find the comedy to be a hindrance because the humor relies on brutality, but is also deeply ironic. Mainly, the entertainment factor depends on personal preference.

135,exterminator_99,Strong performances highlight in British crime caper,9,20 July 2001,"""Sexy Beast"" is not your standard British crime flick of the last five or so years.  Steering away from the (often overly) stylized view of films like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", ""Sexy Beast"" leans more towards its outstanding ensemble cast to carry it along.  While it could be accused of being occasionally slow, it is a superbly scripted film, ultimately saving it from cliche and over familiarity.Gary 'Gal' Dove (Ray Winstone) is a former bank robber, who has unofficially retired from the 'game'.  He lives in his villa in baking hot Spain, spending his hours working on his tan, swimming in his pool and generally doing nothing much.  It's just him, his wife Dee Dee (Amanda Redman), his friend Aitch (the late Cavan Kendall) and Aitch's partner Jackie (Julianne White).  The life he used to know is no more and he can relax for the rest of his life.  Or so he thinks.Enter English hardman and former associate of Gal, Don Logan (Ben Kinsley). Don's in Spain to get Gal to do one more job, on the behalf of London crime lord, Teddy Bass (Ian McShane).  Gal's reluctance to return to the UK for one more job is not what Don wanted to hear...Much of the film is built around the extremely intense verbal sparring between Don and Gal.  Movie buffs who like to remember Ben Kingsley as the pacifist Gandhi will be in for an real shock when they see him as Don Logan! He is superb as the psychopathic hardman, who does not take no for an answer, ever.  Winstone is great as Gal, he has that weathered look to him, not on a physical level, but mentally.  He really has had enough of the life and wants out.  The strain on his life when Don reappears is superbly shown by Winstone.Supporting cast members like Redman and McShane add real weight to the two main characters.  Redman, whose role is small, is impressive as Gal's loving but worried partner and McShane is brilliantly evil as Teddy Bass.  Fans of McShane's British TV series ""Lovejoy"" will also be surprised how easily he can shift between debonair and downright dastardly.Director Glazer has a good hold on the film.  His depictions of both Spain and the UK couldn't be anymore spot on.  Largely he lets the film be carried by Kingsley and Winstone, which is a good idea.  So in all, a fine film with a slighlt muddled ending.  A worthwhile excursion from the sometime cartoon nature of more recent British crime films.  Recommended.",Sexy Beast
136,mbrachman,My Gal the expert yegg,9,16 April 2012,"'Gal' Dove (Ray Winstone), retired English yegg (safe-cracker) and heist man, is living the good life quietly in sunny Spain with his beloved wife (a retired porn actress), his best friend Aitch (another career criminal who's cashed in his chips) and Aitch's wife. All is well until an unwanted old 'friend,' Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), turns up and starts demanding, none too politely, that they return to Old Blighty to assist in carrying out a caper (robbing a bank vault) being organized by Logan's superior, a London underworld lord and frankly scary man by the name of Teddy Bass (played by the pre-""Deadwood"" Ian MacShane), whose quiet menace makes him a thousand times more bone-chilling than the histrionic Logan. The film deftly portrays the anxiety of Gal as he reluctantly joins the caper, the badgering presence of Logan, and the frighteningly quiet lethality of Bass and his London associates as the story moves toward the heist and its confusing aftermath. Gal's fear of being trapped in a deadly situation is enhanced by the fact that, before Gal's coming to London, Logan has disappeared and his whereabouts are unknown, and Teddy Bass makes clear that he wants to know what happened to his right-hand man, and Teddy Bass is a man with whom one does not trifle. A nail-biter with numerous narrative twists, superbly-realized characters, and the type of conflictual interpersonal dynamics that make other great heist films ('The Asphalt Jungle,' 'Rififi') so engrossing, ""Sexy Beast"" is one of the best English-language films of the new millennium. Also appearing in this one is the excellent James Fox as a London banker in over his head.",Sexy Beast

The lead character, wonderfully played by Ray Winstone, is a retired criminal living in Spain. Ben Kingsley's character comes into the pictured and stirs things up, asking help for a heist. And he is quite the vicious, sick and messed-up character. The performances are impressive, Kingsley really pulls off the phycho character. Some wonderful cinematography, stylish editing and dark humour make the movie flow beautifully. My only complaint is the length.

Why were these ex-patriots living the good life in Spain so worriedabout a short, sociopathic illiterate coming to visit?  I could tell thatman NO and get on with my life no questions asked.  I would notneed to sweat over it, and repeat myself a dozen times to get mypoint across.  Is this what British humor has been reduced to?The movie is poorly paced  and at times so slow I felt I was tryingto back up a car stuck in mud.  Then the film, like the mud boundcar, frees itself from only to surge forward in a sloppy manner. Maybe I just don't get it, but it is not a funny film.",Sexy Beast
139,RuthlessGoat,Kingsley is a Tasmanian Devil with Tourettes,10,21 August 2004,"sociopath (noun) 1. A person who is completely unable or unwilling to behave in a way that is acceptable to society. 2. Don LoganThe movie begins innocuously enough, with retired gangster and safe cracker Gal baking in the intense Mediterranean sun, pool bound at his Spanish villa. A giant boulder rolls into his life and into his pool, providing a harbinger of things to come. The quaint tranquility of Gal, wife and friends is broken with the news of a phone call and the imminent arrival of a much more dangerous and sinister human boulder, Don Logan. Ben Kingsley's performance is simply over the top madness that will have you squirming with discomfort then quaking in fear. He plays a part -time gangster and full-time sociopath who is like a speeding freight train without brakes, a Looney Toons Tasmanian Devil with Tourettes, a pit bull with A.I.D.S., only much, much worse. Don has come to recruit the retired Gal for one more heist and simply will not take no for an answer. The dialogue between Don and Gal is Mametian-like staccato that will have you reeling. ""No-no-no-no...Yes-Yes-Yes-Yes!"" has never been uttered with more vitriol and intensity as the confrontation builds to unbearable levels.Thumbs up to Jonathan Glazer for a great job of direction, really a slick effort. Kingsley dominates this fine cast, but great performances are put in by Winstone, as Gal and Amanda Redman as DeeDee, standing up to the ruthless Logan. I don't want to spoil the movie, rent it or BUY IT, but Gal ends up going to London to do the job. Here's a scary thought....Don Logan is NOT the meanest, most evil character in the movie, that honor is reserved for Teddy Bass, just watch the movie and see.

144,Mercader79,What's in a name?,7,19 July 2001,"After all the dross produced in the name of the post-Lock Stock British gangster film industry at last a good movie has been made: Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast. (The only other exceptions would be Gangster No.1 and Guy Ritchie's own highly Lock Stock-esque Snatch). From the brilliant opening scene to the last Sexy Beast is littered with masterful surrealistic touches. Although Ray Winstone gives a career best performance as Gary - the retired gangster who just wants to be left alone in his utopian Mediterranean idyll, it is true Ben Kingsley somewhat steals the show. As Don he is as hilarious as he is terrifying. In a unique performance which owes nothing De Niro or Pesci or indeed anything I've seen him play before (certainly a far cry from Gandhi!) Kingsley illuminates every scene he is in as a monster of cockney menace. British TV star Ian McShane is also convincingly malevolent as the ambidextrous Teddy Bass and James Fox also shines in a fleeting appearance.Unlike so many British directors Glazer is genuinely cinematic - using the screen to the full, particularly in the opening sequence. He is certainly a talent to watch even if Sexy Beast made less of a splash commercially than hoped.One quibble - like Grosse Point Blank and Boston Kickout, Sexy Beast is lumbered with an inappropriate and poorly chosen name.

146,garuda4,Guess who's coming to Dinner?,7,15 July 2001,"After all the reviews I found myself waiting impatiently for Ben Kingsley's character to make his appearance. After all we were told he plays as loathsome a character as  has stepped onto the screen. They were right. Ben (Don Logan) gets right under your skin once he opens his mouth and the foulness of his personna spews out. This is a guy that definitely needs killing, but no-one seems to have the cojones to do it.
Be prepared for a torrent of the worst swear words the English language has to offer-especially the one considered the foulest of all-spoken so often, and with such venom, that one never becomes desensitized to them.
Ben is someone you don't say no to, and for most of the movie our anti-hero tries to present that word with many democratic faces. Ben's ultimate rejoinder is to jackhammer out ""No"" so fiercly that he wears down the opposition. With Ben off the screen things are pretty tame and derivative, although with some quirky nightmare scenes thrown in. The Heist itself is rather stupid in it's implausibility, and Ian McShane gets to be black and Demonic. Yes Ben you have made us temporarily forget Gandhi.",Sexy Beast
147,mryerson,Gem of a black comedy masquerading as a caper film.,8,16 July 2007,"Snazzy little, fast-paced noir. If the excess in this Brit caper film doesn't make you giggle out loud, have someone check your pulse. Quality production top to bottom with most players unfamiliar to American audiences. The plot is deceptively simple: retired safecracker is approached by hood to come out of retirement for one last 'go' at the behest of a distant crime boss. Turns out to be an offer he can't refuse. Ian McShane plays crime boss Teddy Bass with reptilian cool, Ray Winstone's safecracker Gal Dove is sleek, tanned and thoroughly retired and James Fox gives the connected bank executive just the right balance of smarmy decadence. The troop of supporting actors is fresh and without caricature, the women beyond adolescent coquettishness, cool, secure and supremely sexy, the men displaying accumulated bling and adipose fat, rutting through middle age. But this film belongs to Ben Kingsley and his psychotic Don Logan. Sometimes seething, sometimes frenetic, always thoroughly frightening, he is absolutely mesmerising. Easily the most consistently threatening performance in recent memory. Beautifully photographed, the direction is deft and crisp, the dialogue dense and believable and, thankfully, not lost in the usual muddle of British accents.

149,cannonclubonline,Interesting British Gangster Film With Several Surprising Twists,7,28 June 2010,"First-time feature director Jonathan Glazer (who earned his stripes shooting videos for Massive Attack and Radiohead) does an amazing job of keeping everything in perspective while giving the film his own personal imprint.What makes this film so rewarding is that it constantly ups the ante, never once settling for the conventional. It never misses an opportunity to surprise or excite the viewer.The film originally premiered in September of 2000 at the Toronto International Film Festival, then opened in January 2001 in the UK and worked its way to the US in June. Superior writing, acting, and direction almost always define a great film & this one has it all. Screenwriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto create a battle of wills and words that gives the likes of David Mamet & Steven Berkoff a run for their money. The film veers from comedy to drama & back again without skipping a beat.The film picks up with the sunning by the pool of Gary 'Gal' Dove (Ray Winstone), a noticeably British bloke who happens to be a so-called fat-cat UK mobster who has obviously hit his retirement with a perfect zest and zeal for the good life. Our slightly overweight ex-villain has a thick working-class accent who seems to be passing his time away lounging on his bright white Costa del Sol sun-deck in his skimpy yellow Euro Speedos talking to himself about how ""bloody 'ot"" it is. The nuance of his relaxation is heightened by the playing of the song ""Peaches"" by the punk band called The Stranglers.Suddenly a huge boulder careens down the Spanish hillside above Gal's opulent stucco villa and crashes into the pool, missing Gal by inches.Gal is married to Deedee (Amanda Redman), who he dearly loves, but somehow has gotten past all the sordid past of her being a former porn-queen whose nickname turns out to be ""dirty Deedee"". — are sitting around in a restaurant waiting for their friends Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White) to join them. You can barely understand a word out of Aitch's mouth but Jackie looks worried. Very worried, in fact. Within minutes, the fear on her dining companions' faces is palpable.Don Logan wants Gal to do a job. He's picking a team and he wants the very best. This Friday, at the Grosvenor Hotel. London. Gal wants none of it. He's retired, remember? ""I'm retired,"" he tells Jackie.""Well, you can tell him yourself,"" says Jackie. ""He's on his way over."" Don doesn't take no for an answer. Cutting to a shot of bald-headed Don (Sir Ben Kingsley) striding ardently through a crowded airport & you already know there's going to be some kind of trouble.Certainly Kingsley is formidable (in a role the Gandhi man appears to relish), but Winstone is equal to him in a less flamboyant performance. Amanda Redman (Deedee) also deserves recognition; she reacts a lot with her eyes, especially in the presence of Don threatening thug, but her performance is beautifully subtle, yet extremely effective. Ian McShane provides additional malevolence in the brooding black-attired form of arch-villain Teddy Bass.The film has its violent moments, of course, a lot of them verbal (Don Logan is a walking, talking Molotov cocktail of viciousness and slurs), but the film is more likely to be remembered for its humor and Gal's undying love for his wife.Cavan Kendall, who plays Aitch (Gal's best friend), soon passed at the age of 57 shortly after the making of this film. Julianne White, who is Australian plays her character quite well also.",Sexy Beast
150,volatileacid_at_gmail_dot_com,Fascinating? Are the rest of you on mind bending drugs!?,1,12 November 2007,"This film was absolutely awful. Let me tell you why.The first 1/5 of the film is spent introducing the first four characters (two couples) - and this must have been on a tight budget, because they only used a couple of sets - one by the pool, the other in the restaurant.The acting was really poor - and the characters even less believable.Let me elaborate.... lets take Ray Winstone - what a poor choice of lead character. He neither comes across believable, nor does he have an ounce of menace about him - I mean let's be serious - is he your idea of a big time gangster in retirement? PLEASE...The problem with this film, is that it stars Ben Kingsley, who some people would give 10/10 even if the production was absolute rubbish.Towards the end of the first fifth of this film ,we have some more poor acting, when Aitch and Jackie approach the dinner table, seeming to come across as they've seen a ghost - trembling with fear because they've picked up a phone call from the brutal(not) Don Logan (Kingsley). The acting at this point is quite pitiful and overdone.When you see Ben Kingsley for the first time, you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd just starved himself for an upcoming role in Ghandi. I mean the man is scrawny, aged, and has no presence. His overacting showed no bounds where in the next 3/5's of the film, he kept pestering the lead character agree to a 'job'...Oh and the big surprise was, he had slept with Aitch's wife... woo hoo Big deal ! I can't be bothered to write anymore about this film, except to say that it was an anti climatic bore of an excuse for a director to put reel to camera and produce this junk.It just wasn't convincing and the storyline was pants.ps. and what's all that underwater drilling rubbish about...Oh god this is depressing - don't watch it, even on DVD or 19th re-run, unless you're a Kingsley fanboy.ALSO..

However, a very unpleasant visit from Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) drags him back into the dark underworld of violence and bank robbery.Ask anyone, and they will tell you the best thing about the film is its three leading stars, Ian McShane, Ben Kingsley and Winstone, who are cracking in the roles and the relationships between the character.My only concern is that the second half of the flick pans out like you pretty much expect in the linear well known gangster format with the 'job' taking the role of the film's climax. And despite being done well, and having a few twists, it is heavily over-shadowed by the psychological, tension-packed first half in Spain - with the relationship between Gal and Don being the best thing the film has to offer.A decent British gangster flick...set in Spain.

160,captain_bungle,Excellent British Film!,9,12 April 2005,"British Gangster Movies  : Think Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, think Snatch, think mockney caricatures, think Guy Ritchie. Then think again. Try to imagine a film where cartoon violence is replaced with brutality, where pointless macho dialogue is replaced with biting, poignant wit and where bland stereotypes are replaced with well-rounded and interesting characters. Think Sexy Beast, a British Gangster Movie  with a difference.Ray Winstone is Gary Dove, a retired bank robber who now resides in sunny Spain, living the quite life with his beautiful wife Amanda Redman. Gary's out of shape. He's putting on weight and his exercise consists of reaching for another margarita by the pool. Gary couldn't be happier...Ben Kingsley is Don Logan, a psychopathic thug with a foul mouth and a violent temper. He works in London for mob boss Ian McShane, and he's got a job to do; get Gary to come back for one last raid. Gary knows Logan's on his way and he's made up his mind that he's not going to do it. Sounds simple, but Don Logan is not the type of man you want to say no to, as he doesn't take no for an answer. Logan arrives, immediately disrupting Gary's idyllic life with his vulgar mouth and antisocial behaviour, then he tells him about the job. Gary declines, politely. Logan, true to form, insists that he do it. A battle of wills erupts as Gary tries to let Logan down without getting himself or his wife killed, but a brutal psychological showdown leaves Gary with no other option than to do the job Debut feature director Jonathan Glazer (he of the 'horses riding waves' Guinness advert) keeps the simple story tight and entertaining, combining surrealistic imagery with a sun-soaked Spanish location and concentrating on what makes Sexy Beast a real gem: the performances. Winstone is as good as ever as the put-upon Gary Dove, but this is Kingsley's film, as he takes Logan and makes him his own, making us believe in what could easily have been a one-dimensional character and delivering a multi-layered performance. Witness Gandhi saying lines that would make a dog blush as he insults, threatens and manipulates Gary and his friends with a razor-sharp tongue that spits venom and electrifies the screen. The dialogue is fresh and biting, with some of the most witty and imaginative use of swearing ever committed to film. If you're offended by the dreaded 'C' word, Sexy Beast may not be for you, as it graces almost every line of dialogue throughout the film. In the wrong hands, the script could have been played very badly, but Kingsley's energy and conviction makes the sweary dialogue seem almost poetic. Example: 'You f--kin' doctor-white honking, jam-rag f--kin' spunk bubble! You keep looking at me, Aitch, and I'll put you in the f--kin' ground!' Although this may not read like poetry, you have to listen to Kingsley's wording to appreciate it. But believe me, you'll be quoting Don Logan for weeks! For a director whose output consists mainly of elaborate music videos and commercials, Glazer wisely concentrates instead on acting and narrative to deliver a great film - if only more filmmakers would heed to the simple rule that story and performance make for good entertainment. The style is still there, though, as there are some great surreal visuals and Gary's nightmares of a hairy man-hare wielding a machine gun are incredibly effective. Sexy Beast packs a punch in all departments, never flagging or giving in to distracting sub-plots, but going all out to deliver a tight, thrilling, funny, horrific British Gangster Movie  that entertains right up until the far-too-early ending. At a blink-and-you'll-miss-it running time of 84 minutes, Sexy Beast does something that not many films do now days; leave you wanting more.",Sexy Beast

163,mpdmartin,One of the best British gangster films ever made,9,14 August 2017,"Sexy Beast (2000) Reviewed by Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook. London villain goes into retirement on the Costa del Crime but is 'persuaded' back to do one last job. It's the kind of story told many times before, often badly. Jonathan Glazers' directorial debut however, revisits this old territory with a unique style of its own. From the surreal dream sequences to the razor sharp dialogue, it never lets up. Ex-con and safe-cracker Gary ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone) is enjoying his idyllic lifestyle in Spain with his beloved wife DeeDee (Amanda Redman) and his longtime friend Aitch and his wife Jackie. Their tranquillity is shattered by the arrival of an old criminal associate, Don Logan (Ben Kingsley). Logan has been sent out to bring Gal back for a major bank heist and he's not taking no for an answer. The reaction of Gal and DeeDee and their friends, upon hearing of Logans' imminent arrival, sets the tone for this most unwelcome of visitors. It's the measure of a great actor that the man who earlier in his career had played the title role in Richard Attenboroughs' 'Gandhi' is so convincing in the role of a vicious sociopath. From the moment he appears on-screen Kingsleys' ferocious portrayal of Logan dominates every scene he appears in and his fearsome presence begins a chain of events from which there will be no going back. Upon returning to London Gal is reunited with Teddy Bass, the heist organiser, played by Ian McShane, another superb performance. In any other film McShane would have won the acting plaudits. The film lingers long in the memory for Kingsleys' role though. The cast and quality of acting turn 'Sexy Beast' from a standard crime caper film into something quite different. Winstone is excellent as Gal, a man whose past demons come back to consume him and push him to breaking point. There is also a terrific performance from Amanda Redman as DeeDee, his beleaguered wife. Crime thrillers rarely portray female lead characters with any real substance but Amanda Redman here, like Sharon Stone in Scorseses' 'Casino' is a notable exception. Seventeen years on 'Sexy Beast' still stands as one of the best crime thrillers ever made. In 2004 it was voted 15th best British film of all time by 'Total Film' magazine. Highly Recommended.

164,amberace,Not more cockney gangsters,4,9 February 2002,"Honestly British film makers seem obsessed with presenting us with costume dramas and cockney gangsters. Yet more dull gangster rehash, shot in an annoying pop video style. The script was appalling, the plot ridiculous.

165,helaumur,the cream of British acting,10,3 May 2011,"This film is by far the most underrated of British cinema. You think its just another gangster film but you are wrong. It is full of mythological imagery. It is wonderfully shot and the sound track brings some humour. You believe the characters are real. their interaction is in some part Verite. Amanda Redman and Ray Winston, you believe they do love each other and Winston would move heaven and earth for her. Ben Kingsley plays the psychopath so well, he actually reminds me of a yapping dog who will stop at nothing to get the rat. His whole persona is ""you will!"". Its as if he is outside his body when he is interrogating Winstons refusal to do this one last job. His appearance causes such fear, he does not need to be violent. The locations are beautiful as a contrast the black evil that is coming to the villa. Winston in his huge size and kind face is n o match for the shorter yet animalistic Kingsley who, if you've seen him in Schindlers list is a total contradiction for this amazing character actor. He sits there like a king not even making demands except with his body language, not even saying anything about why he is there. Everyone should watch this film. The performances are so intense, its as if even the film crew walk on egg shells. The shots are amazing, illustrating the vastness that is Spain, away from the grime ridden England that Ray Winston's character has escaped. Kingsley does not so much as request help but talks in the rhetoric that even Winston cannot refuse politely. Stuttering like a child, Kingsley's voice is calm one minute and instantly becomes an evil entity in what began as a calm film about a man made good from a life of crime. Even Lovejoy himself, Ian Macshane is in his element as a don. Stylish, never shouting, its like a folie a deux when they get together. I cannot praise this film enough, its cool, its scary, its stylish. Not your typical gangster film but it has created a new genre of gangster film. Just superb. Ray Winston, Ben Kingsley, Amanda Redman, Ian Macshane. we salute you are the cream of British cinema that we do not see as much as we should.",Sexy Beast
166,SICKO_XXX,perfect british film with some of the great dialogues ever!!!,10,29 July 2002,"this is a great example of the British cinema and how much further they are than Hollywood.The story of Sexy Beast is a very simple story. Gary Dove is a former criminal and now lives in a nice villa in Spain. But then they get a call from Don Logan, and he asks Gary to come to London for one last big job. Gary doesn't want to do this job, but Don doesn't except this. because of old fights and betrayed honour, there begins a heavy battle between them, and ends in a final confrontation.ok, that is the story. but i hear you think what makes this movie then so great? It's how the whole story fits together the great dialoques in the film. Actually it's the whole film, the suspense, the fear for Don Logan. It's also the surrounding in the film witch makes the film also a bit sticky, and for this picture it is perfect.So go and see this movie and let me know what you think of it. Because it is one of my favorites. Greetings from Gijs and the rest of Holland. See you.",Sexy Beast
167,Kurzbein,Thoroughly enjoyable,10,10 September 2003,"The obvious reason to recommend Sexy Beast is Ben Kingsley's stunning, forceful performance.  Kingsley plays the Don Logan character with single-minded focus and calculated  nastiness.  He stuns us not so much with what he does, which is plenty rough, but with what he appears capable of doing.  All one can hope for when one encounters a person like this is to survive the encounter and the scrapes and bruises that accompany it.Kingsley's performance could easily have overpowered the other actors were they not up to the task.  But they were, and they make their characters more than the caricatures they easily could have become.  Ray Winstone has the most difficult assignment because he has to match Kingsley's intensity but not his power, and in managing that task, Winstone gives the performance of the film.Sexy Beast is yet another caper film, but the plot has enough twists and the characters enough quirks to keep it interesting.  The film is visually stylish, but not overly so.  The dialog has a poetic quality.  Some great choices were made for music.  And then there are moments of genuine quirkiness and humor.  In short, the film is serious but doesn't take itself too seriously.  Basically, this is a film about people trying to preserve the niche they've carved for themselves when outside forces try to destroy it, and it's thoroughly enjoyable.",Sexy Beast
168,azerda,"A bland, never really there, montage of semi-related stories",1,27 July 2001,"It's really not surprising to find out that the director of this drivel made his name in the land of TV commercials. The movie never really seems to be one whole, but rather is made up of several loosely related 'scenes' which attempt to move the plot along. Not that there is much of a plot to begin with. The movie opens with a send-up of a Kahlua commercial with a jolly fat guy (Gal) sunning himself in the Mediterranean sun. You understand that he is relaxed and fully content with his inactivity and would be very happy to remain so for the rest of his retirement. This is the last time you understand ANYTHING in this movie. There's the cliched recruitment scene (think ""Tastes Great! Less Filling!""), a neither here nor there love triangle ""mess"" that never really goes anywhere except maybe sending you to sleep, and finally an inane bank robbery which still doesn't explain why Gal simply had to be involved.

The second time, I'm skipping it and stop at scenes where I thought I would like it, and I don't. It gets violent sometimes.

Ray Winstone as Gal gains depth and appeal as the picture progresses. Ian McShane is the British Pacino. The impression I got is that Gal's character slowly evolves from sun-worshiping hedonist to someone who knows how close he came to losing it all. But, still....what *was* some of that, and what kind of drugs inspired it? The overall point of the story is lost somewhat.

I cannot recall ever seeing a worse piece of junk than this film.  Not funny.  Not Clever. And one wonders the mental state of the person who wrote this drivel.  Am I missing something here?  Is the new trend for the new millennium? Mean spirited artless crap?  Was this a terrible film or what?  Almost Inaudible, do to bad sound..o.k. probably my t.v. ....but the cockney accent was so thick you could have cut it with a knife, but hell after the first 15 minutes you didn't want to understand it anyway.  Who cared?  Ah yes and then there was my very favorite the required urinal scene .....replete with Ben doing it all over the floor.  Lord knows how clever and ""New"" and cutting edge that was.   It did teach me one thing, at least I will never complain about ""Dumb and Dumber"" again...that was a piece of junk also, but it at least did have some clever moments.  This film other than the Boulder in the Pool and the firearms falling to pieces was utter rubbish in every regard and not only was devoid of humor but was barely a two grinner.   It is this viewers opinion that when this becomes a rental...it should be rented along with ""Leaving Las Vegas""  ""Fight Club"" and while drinking a gallon of cheap wine and popping whatever old medicine hanging around in the bathroom cabinet, flagellating ones self (or bring a friend) repeatedly,  This then would be a lovely evening for those that liked this film.  Well then, for me...this film truly takes the title Dumb and Dumber.  I cannot think of one redeeming thing about this film, Other than it ended eventually.

175,memnova,#2 of the top three WORST films I've ever seen,1,11 August 2001,"Do not ever go see or rent this movie.  I think movie critics are sometimes taken in by art films simply because they are ""art"" films.  The director's attempts at symbolism were ridiculous and incredibly heavy-handed.  When you see what one of my friends calls the gross, psycho bunny-man,  you will probably start laughing in the theater,  as I did.  The symbolic nature of the bunny-man is so obvious that it is an insult to my intelligence. Furthermore,  I had a very hard time understanding what everyone was saying, and I have watched other British movies where the accents are similar.  Ben Kingsley does give a good performance,  but unfortunately I felt like I was the one who was being yelled at during the movie.  In addition,  there is one extremely violent scene that I found to be utterly repulsive.  I am usually not shocked by anything either,  but this was a bit excessive. Don't waste your time going to see this--there are many other films of much higher quality out there.",Sexy Beast

A rudimentary understanding of Britain's criminal Cockney underbelly helps. Ray Winstone nails it, as usual, and Ben Kingsley is just as mesmerizing as you've heard. I think maybe people don't like it because they think it's just supposed to be a crime film. There are a lot of different elements to ""Sexy Beast"", but first and foremost, this is a dark comedy. It's funny. It works. Better than Guy Ritchie's last one. The score is amazing, it really helps to characterize Kingsley's character throughout the film as well as Winstone's at the beginning (GREAT opening sequence). Good pacing here too. The film's not perfect, but it moves fast, and it's highly entertaining in a nonfat, sugar-free sort of way. Like stopping for a quick pint.

It wasn't necessarily a movie filled with complex story lines or action-packed special effects.  Whatever it was, it just worked.  I can't say enough about the performances by these actors, especially Ben Kingsley, who made me hate every fiber in his character almost immediately.  This also marked the first time I had seen Ian McShane since his mullet displays in ""Lovejoy,"" and he was spectacular as well.Although not on the same level of, this movie did remind me of the Tarantino classics, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and does hold its weight as a pretty decent crime-drama.7/10",Sexy Beast

It is impossible to find a plot that doesn't have similarities to other films, they have all been done in one way or another.  This was an excellent play upon the gangster genre.

180,sweavo,Watch it for what it is: a stellar performance and a well paced psychological movie,8,12 February 2007,"Those who give this film one star seem usually to miss the point. This is not a comedy crime drama, but a psychological thriller. The opening scenes paint a picture of Gal's retirement idyll and manage to establish sympathy for a character whose crimes are unknown to us but who now shows only warmth to his wife, his neighbours and even the pool boy.Like many thrillers, the film is driven by a fear of the unknown. First, Logan enters the film significantly before Ben Kingsley appears on the screen. By means of some great dialogue and direction we are frightened by this character and the threat he seems to pose to the lifestyle of our protagonists.Kingsley's performance is spectacular, a deep, multidimensional realisation of a character bristling with the frightening unknown. His task is simple and focused, his behaviour unpredictable and terrifying. This works because we care about Gal and Deedee and the life they have made for themselves. This is not a Pulp Fiction / Snatch / Lock Stock and two Smoking Barrels cartoon gangster caper.This is a realistic drama in which the crime is a (possibly unrealistic) secondary detail.",Sexy Beast

Mostly because of the dialogue and the strong performances by all the actors. Ray Winstone is perfect in the leading role as an easy living x-gangster named Gary, who gets caught up by his past(I just love the intro by the pool). But Ben Kingsley overshadows all others as Don Logan, the ill tempered, unpleasant and (at least I thought) laughable loony henshman for the English mafia, who comes to get Gary back in action. I had only seen him in likable roles like the one in Schindlers List, and i was amazed that he was capable of playing such a different character like Don Logan. outstanding! The story in Sexy Beast is not fantastic in any way, but you have no idea what will happen and how it will end, and i find that pretty cool.

185,mtenga,A slightly surreal twist on the gangster movie,8,17 September 2005,"Ray Winstone seems to have made a career for himself playing psycho hard nuts, but there was surprisingly more humanity to his role as Gal in this film, even a tenderness. It was the classical actor Ben Kingsley who had the real nutter role. Both were played admirably even if Kingsley still looked a bit like a librarian despite his short hair cut, tattoos and mockney accent.Anybody who has seen the excellent 70's movie Villain with Richard Burton will recognise that Ian McShane who had a pretty boy role in that film to Burton's Kray style gangster, gets to ham it up this time as the bad gangster himself. He was quite menacing and the scene with Winstone and James Fox towards the end contained a shocking surprise.The plot was fairly standard fodder, the retired and Spanish ex-pat gangster Winstone pressed into one last job by his former colleagues. The twist being that the former colleague Kingsley, actually has an ulterior motive.Add in the always excellent but sadly underused Amanda Redman and a slightly comic turn from Cavan Kendall and you have a stellar British cast.I got the impression that I was watching a play rather than a film at times and the language will not impress your maiden aunt, but overall it was enjoyable. A few surreal dream sequences mark this film as something more than just the standard swearing, violence and big heist flick.All in all very enjoyable and worth watching but not a classic.",Sexy Beast
186,georgiain,An instant classic,10,28 July 2004,"A hugely impressive debut.  This film crashes into the stagnant pond of recent British crime drama like the boulder at the beginning of the film crashing into retired gangster Gary Dove's pool, smashing the twin heart logo.  A herald indeed for the whirlwind of evil that Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) brings into the film when he arrives to try to recruit Gary for another job back in London.The film works so well because it dares to inject an intelligence into the genre so lacking in many recent offerings.  The characters are caricartures for sure but beautifully sketched.  Like a Hoggarth painting there is emotional depth here which draws you in.  Though never explicitly stated you feel that Gary and Dee Dee are exploited characters, drawn into the underworld and now escaping from it.  These are played off against Don and Teddy who are sociopaths of the first order.  The tension generated between them is electrifying and sometimes almost unbearable.",Sexy Beast

Dee Dee, and H and Teddy, these characters are all time greats, And Winstone...forget about it, he makes Kingsley powerful. Winstone's got him by a hundred pounds but you believe he's afraid of Ghandi..I love him. I'd walk a mile on my hands and knees through broken glass just to have him pee on my toothbrush.

Great, yet simple plot which allowed the actors to standout more and you could appreciate the writing. I believe great stories bring great performances and all of the actors gave great performances, nothing over the top. Ben Kinsley clearing stole every scene, after watching the film. I'm convinced Ben Kinsley is the best actor of our time, because I could see him playing Gandi with ease as well as playing Logan with smooth efficiency.The greatest part of the film was the setting up of how horrible Logan really was.

Maybe he is an out-take from Scary Movie 2.The rest of the performances are good enough for the old-fashioned, obvious story, cliche caper plot and predictable resolution of the genre.

It is just normal crime (gangster) movie, although there is not much shooting. I would rather say, that this is a slow paced, well weighted drama.The story is about a retired gangster, who has no intention about coming back. The thing is, that his boss wants him to do another job. This is the basic conflict, which leads to dramatic after-effects.I would like to compare this movie to 'Snatch' or 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', but Jonathan Glazer (the director of 'Sexy Beast') is definitely not Guy Ritchie. While Ritchie's movies are fast and full of fun and gun shoots, this movie is rather quiet. The emotions and relationships are more important. But unfortunately, this leads to boredom. Although the movie is only 90 minutes or so, you feel like you have just spent 2 hours watching.The last thing I want to talk about is the title.

Sexy Beast is the antithesis of a Hollywood blockbuster.  It is cinema.  It is sexy. It is delicious.  It is almost all that film should be. 
Each character gives rich and thoughtful delivery.  The screenplay has a complexity that's interesting, though could have been slightly stronger.  There are moments I personally desired a deeper development of the relationship between characters, and there are a few holes in the general relationships that never resolve, but for the two main characters, there is brutal honesty.  With such naked display of raw emotion, I needed to watch this twice.  Ben Kingsley proves once more to be one of the greatest contributors to motion pictures, and if you aren't completely taken with his character's opening line, then you miss the entire point of cinema being a true outlet for life.

It doesn't treat death as a joke or gag, it treats its characters with intelligence and depth, and its damn funny to boot.

It speaks volumes about the succession of Brit gangster flicks that only now we see the first character in the genre who is convincingly evil and genuinely fits the feared reputation which precedes him.Kingsley is cold and instantly loathesome, but compulsive viewing for his brilliant dialogue; short and sharp in speaking his mind yet at the same time mixed up in over verbalising and confusing what he actually says.The silent pauses which also accompany the permanently awkward interaction Kingsley has with other characters are also brilliantly timed and portrayed to evoke the real tension which exists throughout, and adds power to the moments when his temperament gets the better of him.What makes this all the more convincing and watchable is the contrasting but equally impressive surroundings in which Kingsley appears.The life of retired crooks on the Spanish coast is made impossibly inviting, comfortable and cosy without being cheaply glamourised, Winstone as Gal leading a set of strong performances as an endearing and essentially harmless ex-pat taking things easy and minding his own business along with refreshingly un-hollow wife and best friends.The scene is set for the psychological battle of minds between the amiable Winstone and the relentless Kingsley, but also with a string of ultimately irrelevant but all the more entertaining scenes which add to the solidity of the film - the swimming pool, the hunting, the aeroplane.When events switch to a purposely contrasting London the turn of plot sees the pace of the film increase as the movie explodes into full-blown and for the most part familiar - although understated - gangster style.The director makes things so much more viewable and impressive with his occasional jumps back and forth between separate scenes as well as returning to already used themes and settings.It says so much about the quality of the film that the actual crime is almost unimportant and unneccessary for the viewers enjoyment, yet it is still carried out with intelligent direction, capturing the ruthless workmanlike approach of the gang and linking events to the more important storylines involved.In London the quiet calculating kingpin Teddy Bass picks up the well acted battle of wits with Winstone from Kingsley, and once again the timing and conciseness of interaction add to the film, what is not said as important as what is said.By the end the characters have depth, hold our attention and are genuinelymemorable - so much more so than the endless stream of stereotypical cockney wise guys throughout the genre who in many cases are forgettable but for their comedy value.In other words, 'Sexy Beast' has to all intents and purposes reinvented the Brit Gangster flick genre with a movie that stands out from the crowd with good reason.Sadly, it doesn't seem to have made it to many cinemas, which is a tragedy as it deserves a wider audience - a production which is brilliant for the right reasons a *film* should succeed: the acting, direction and scenery, not just the storyline.Superb acting throughout - Winstone is exceptional and Kingsley simply unmissable - as well as clever direction, and 'Sexy Beast' adds up to a real gem. Everything is done in moderation, there are no shortcuts taken to increase entertainment value or obligatory excessive violence or neverending visual humour; it doesn't try to make you like it, you just will like it.",Sexy Beast
198,zoodc,I give it 4 syllables: O-VER-RAY-TED.,3,6 September 2001,"It tries to be this Tarantino/Lock-Stock/Scorcese kind of movie and falls so lamely on its face, stomach, and ass. It's neither funny nor compelling, and unless you missed any of the movies it copies from, you'll find it totally unoriginal and daft.Ben Kingsley as a mean crime guy and post-crime lacky Gal is played by Ray Winstone. The acting is good, but after awhile, becomes monotonous. The plot is weak and the climax is limp with that everlong cliche of busting into some super secure area.First time director Jonathan Glazer has no idea what the story should be about so you're given dramatic moments, comic moments, and regurgitated camera tricks. I suppose for anyone new to crime dramedies, this might seem a watchable movie, but for someone who has seen the original films this one steals from, it's a forgettable trip down stupidity lane.",Sexy Beast
199,SnoogansRD,What did they say?,6,3 October 2001,"I thought that the plot and action in this movie were fantastic.  Thecinematography and location were good as well.

201,Fence,A great film,9,7 December 2002,"I really enjoyed it. Ray Winstone is, as usual, fantastic.  His acting here is perfect. We really fear the Ben Kingsley character all the more when we see how terrified Gal is.Gal (short for Gary) is a retired British crook. living it up in the sunshine of Spain when an old colleague pays him a visit. Don Logan is not a person to say no to. Not only is he a dangerous psycho but he just won't accept no for an answer. This leads to some wonderfully surreal arguments between Logan and Gal.Other reviews I have read have mentioned that the accents posed a bit of a problem for American viewers, but if we can understand all the different US accents, well then you should make an effort, you will be rewarded.Excellent, funny and with some brilliant stand-out moments, well worth watching. DVD is nothing special, no great features",Sexy Beast
202,jawmo,Sir Ben,6,19 November 2012,"This is by no means a great film, but Sir Ben Kingsley is positively incandescent. I dare anyone to take his or her eyes off the screen for a second -- it can't be done. He's done excellent work in the past, of course, but if you've only seen him in ""Gandhi"" or ""Schindler's List,"" prepare for a paradigm shift. The script is workaday, standard gangster heist stuff. The other actors are perfectly fine too. But totally eclipsed by Sir Ben. And the director obviously knew it, because roughly the first half of the film consists of the rest of the characters girding themselves for Sir Ben's character's arrival. And boy, does he arrive!",Sexy Beast
203,Deadfool,Forgive me for saying it but This Movie Suck A$$..,1,19 April 2010,"if I was to describe this movie in 4 words then I would say THIS MOVIE SUCK ASS.******* CONTAIN MINOR SPOILOR ******* First of all I would like to start with saying I am a British, born & grew up in East London, so before anyone thinks I might had not understand the accent or see the movie from a Brit point of view then its total nonsense.This movie was nothing but a complete & utter rubbish except the you get to see a different act of Ben Kingsley (portrait as Don Logan a Essex Gangster with extreme Cockney Accent) People say in their comments Ben rocked in this movie & his performance was the absolute Oscar winner, I can't resist to roll my eyes & ask those people that has any of you actually heard someone speaking in British Cockney Accent for you to know that for a Oscar Winner Brit he really sucked in that role, indomitably his facial & physical reactions & dialogue delivery was nothing but perfect but he pushed it abit to off with his accent, although some of you may disagree but I am a huge fan of Ben Kingsley & I had really high hopes with him & Ray Winston together in a action flick & ended up with nothing but disappointment.With regards to the story line, this suppose to be some high end robbery which requires bunch of pro Cons team & & needed to be pulled off as it supposedly couldn't be done without high risk involve, which is the reason why Ben flies from Briton to Spain to convince or somewhat force Ray Winston (Gal) to do this job, when yet the heist itself turns out without the shadow of a doubt the most stupidest idea or robbing a secure vault of all time, which could have been done bunch of Contruction Workers or your local Builders, not to mention Ray was needed for his skills which were never used as he meant to be some greatest safecracker lol.PS:~ I have never seen Ray playing a chicken role, despite he may have been out of business but no one should continuously smack you around & disrespect you & your wife & you just sit there act dazed, confused & scared.Thats my 2 cents anyways, just like a lot of people I absolutely hated this movie, it was slow, boring, confusing & most importantly ridiculous from start to the end.So unless you're a HUGE & I mean MASSIVE, British movie fan or simply was hate your favourite actors Ben or Ray then please watch this movie else avoid at all cost.",Sexy Beast
204,rmuenz,Gangster film at it's best!,9,21 January 2006,"This film is actually an 8, but I gave it a 9 because Kingsley deserves it for his performance. He is truly terrifying. The story in this film is a good one and hardly predictable. It is not entirely original yet it is done well and therefore is a good movie.Kingsley is so crazy in this film that you can't help but to despise and admire him at the same time. Also Glazer demonstrates his successful history as a music video director, he uses music so effectively in the film that you feel like it is a music video in some scenes. This is a good thing. The only other movie that comes close in this manner is Hype Williams' Belly (please note: Sexy Beast is a better film for originality, yet Belly is still very entertaining).I recommend this film to fans of gangster flicks, yet film buffs will also enjoy the incredibly high calibre of acting in this film.",Sexy Beast
205,theunitednations,I hated it.,1,29 March 2002,"One of the few films under 90 minutes that has almost nothing going for it. I didn't find it exciting, humorous, engaging, or even entertaining. It was just there. It is aggravating to me that this film exists. The opening sequence with the boulder is nice, I thought to myself, ah, I'm in for a nice surprise. But that was the end of it all for me. Indecipherable speaking, filled with profanities as far as the ear can hear, why? because Ben Kingsley was Ghandi so its so cleverly ironic? I don't know how this got made or why people watch it or like it. It's almost as bad as Scary Movie 2, but at least they had David Cross.",Sexy Beast
206,christopherhenderson,An Extended Short with hardly any plot... that works,9,25 June 2001,"The one line summary says it all.  Great editing and cinematography.  Ben Kingsley can play just about anyone.  There is hardly any plot in this film, but the quick cuts and edits make this film highly enjoyable.  I would pay another $10 to see it again.9 out of 10",Sexy Beast
207,CornPickle,A great performance by Ben Kinglsey,7,1 August 2006,"Sexy Beast is an intelligent British gangster flick that is one part character study and one part heist movie. The film begins in a luxurious Spanish villa, home of Gary Dove, and ex-gangster. From the films title sequence and also the boulder scene it is clear from the beginning that this isn't a film that takes itself too seriously. But when Don Logan, played by Ben Kinglsey, comes into the picture a battle of wits ensues between the unhinged Don and Gary. Ben has come to Spain to convince Gary to take part in a heist back in England but the retired gary is reluctant as he has settled down to his life in the villa. However he is eventually forced to and arrives in England to do the job. At this point the film becomes a standard British heist flick though entertaining, in my opinion it lost a bit of steam at this point in contrast to the first half of the film which is gripping due to Ben Kingsleys funny and frightening performance as physcotic gangster Don. Ben Kingsley was nominated for an Oscar for this performance and he definitely deserved to as it was brilliant performance which gave an entertaining gangster film much more depth and meaning.",Sexy Beast
208,jamoo,Tense !,9,18 November 2001,"This is the kind of film that would work well on stage. It relies wholly on a brilliant script and flawless acting to pull the viewer in. It's not a movie for children or fans mainstream American cinema. Funny how easy it is to draw comparisons between those two groups of people.I know some people found the accents difficult, and I suggest that those people keep their opinions to themselves as they probably missed 90% of the content. If you don't understand a cockney accent then you probably wont get the humour or much at all about this movie.In summary, it's simple; it's clever; its tense and well worth seeing.",Sexy Beast
209,sonztwin,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant",9,30 December 2005,"I just saw the tail end of this (last 60%, maybe) on IFN (bless you, IFN), and already I love it. This film makes Tarantino look like an amateur (I've always considered Pulp Fiction somewhat over-rated, and Reservoir Dogs VERY overrated, despite good performances in both). This movie had me on the edge of my seat. Yeah the director used some tricks (like when DeeDee was shown lying in bed with her eyes open - was she dead? Had Don blown her off in a rage?), but a '9' is a pretty good score in my books. Kingsley was just over-the-top brilliant - meaning it wasn't overplayed or anything, but just a supreme performance that's PITCH PERFECT! The language, or the violence? Well, my friends, I'm not about gratuitous cussing or gore, but everything fits in this film, including those 2 elements. They're portraying ruthless gangsters, for crying out loud. What do you expect - prithee please, with a cherry on top? For a simple story, it held great suspense to this viewer. Well done!",Sexy Beast

211,welchdk,great movie,9,9 October 2006,"I'm giving it a nine for the excellent acting and good production values. Ben Kingsley was completely convincing as the embodiment of evil. Ray Winstone was awesome and I actually cared for his character even though he was living on money made from crime. He didn't seem to be the type who would want to hurt anyone, but when he starts slugging Don Logan after he's been shot, you certainly understand why. I think they should have shot the man as soon as he walked in the door but then that would have been a short movie. All the other cast members were good and I was completely caught up in the simple story. The photography and editing were top-notch.",Sexy Beast
212,the-english-gentleman,I am now mortally afraid of the man who played Ghandi,8,1 December 2005,"Ben Kingsley played Mahatma Ghandi. He got an Oscar for it. He was globally recognised as being a dead ringer for the most peaceful man on earth.Ben Kingsley also played a man called Don Logan, who is not a peaceful man. Don Logan is the only fictional creation I have ever feared might lean out of the screen and kill me in an unnecessarily painful way. I am actually afraid of him. I watched this film in a constant state of fear. Not fear for the other characters in the film - fear for ME PERSONALLY.There's no way I can describe Don Logan to you in a way that will accurately convey his psychosis and terrible screen presence. And when I say 'terrible', I use it in its truest sense - that which inspires terror.Don Logan argues with himself. He pees on the floor of other people's houses. He is foul-mouthed but mostly soft-spoken. He says funny things but has no discernible sense of humour. He is shorter and smaller in frame than Gal (Ray Winstone), but utterly dominates him without question for the entirety of their scenes together. He swings from quietly jovial to a raving monster, always a second away from extreme violence, crackling with maniacal energy. He's a terrifying man, and perhaps his most frightening trait is his persistence. NOTHING can turn him away from his objective. Jesus, I watched this last night and I'm still shaking. It's half past three in the afternoon and I'm still shaking.Of course, Kingsley as Logan isn't the only thing in Sexy Beast, and not the only good thing either. In fact, everybody in this film turns in a great performance. Ray Winstone toning down his massive screen presence is quite an achievement. He's far from the two-snooker-balls-in-a-sock Daddy he was in Scum. Here he's still a cockney geezer, but he's retired from crime and lives only for two things: his beautiful ex-porn star wife Dee Dee (the gorgeous Amanda Redman), and lying in the Spanish sunshine, roasting.The plot of the film, not that it's really that important in a film with characters like these, is the hoary old 'one last job' scenario. But, as we all know, everything's been done before. It's how you use the material differently that matters. Ostensibly, this is a heist movie. But the actual heist is only on screen for about five minutes. The rest of the film is Gal being menaced by either Don Logan or Teddy Bass.Ah... Teddy Bass. Now, Teddy Bass is played by Ian McShane. Now, for readers outside the UK, Ian's major acting role before Sexy Beast was 'Lovejoy', a TV series about a cheerful, scheming antiques dealer with quite a hardcore mullet and a nice line in witty asides to the camera. The most menacing he got in that was a half-hearted frown and a 'never mind, tomorrow's another day' shrug.In Sexy Beast, McShane plays Satan.Teddy Bass is not as immediately frightening as Don Logan. He works his magic slowly, turning up the frighteners gently so that you don't realise you've been terrified of him until you look down and become aware you've peed in your pants. He is like a refined version of Logan - dapper, urbane, quiet, and infinitely more dangerous. After all, Logan works for this man, not the other way round.If Teddy Bass told me to pull my own head off I would, because the result of disobeying him would be far, far worse. Need proof? Watch the end where he asks Gal for £10 change from his twenty. A simple thing like that becomes a matter of mortal danger. Incredible.But still, the most kudos has to go to Logan for his inventive excuse for being thrown off a plane for smoking. I challenge you not to crack up in nervous laughter when he describes the male flight attendant's attempts to 'touch me on my front bottom'. Or when he uses the sentence 'I had to sit down, I was so perturbed'.Overall, this film is good, but no classic. Kinglsey's performance, and to a very slightly lesser degree, McShane's, ARE classic, however. Kinglsey was nominated for an Oscar for this and only the fact that 'Iris' was about somebody dying of a lingering disease (and was therefore extremely Oscar-friendly) meant that he missed out. McShane deserves recognition too, but then, I don't suppose there'd be any Al Swearengen from 'Deadwood' without Teddy Bass, so I suppose you get what you deserve in the end. And Don Logan will be a performance talked about for years to come. If genuine audience appreciation means anything to Ben Kingsley, he'll be perfectly happy for a good while.Good stuff.",Sexy Beast

Then again, I doubt it.I can't believe others would compare it to ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" or even the best film noir since ""Chinatown,"" ""L.A. Confidential.""First of all, the music was way too loud. I have seen many movies in the theater in which I saw this one, so I know the mix was off.More over, the plot was easily one of the worst I have been audience to. I kept waiting for the movie to happen. When the credits rolled, I had to think of which part of the movie was supposed to be the climax.Furthermore, there's absolutely no character development. Not once did I relate to any of the characters or feel anything but contempt for them.This over-rated piece of tripe must be put in it's place.

Of course, Ben Kingsley is remarkable and steels the show. I imagine his character living with his mother until he was about 30, what with his unruly, angsty behavior. But Ray Winstone is also very good here and you can't help but feel you are being dragged into this thing along with him. I wish Jonathon Glazer would give us more films.",Sexy Beast
217,AlexMc1987,Underrated British gangster flick,9,28 March 2011,"In terms of pure enjoyment this is one of the best British gangster movies ever in my opinion. Ray Winstone plays Gary 'Gal' Dove - a retired London thief and ex-convict living the high life in the Costa Del Sol whose life is torn apart when he is summoned to London and ordered to undertake one last job by a vicious gangster. Ray Winstone does his usual Ray Winstone thing, most of us know adaptability isn't his strong point, whether he's playing Henry VIII or an American henchman, but he's perfect here as the tired and troubled Dove. The director Jonathan Glazer was best known for directing music videos but you'd never know. His use of the camera and the way he undoubtedly gets the best from the actors is the hallmark of a much more experienced director. If British gangster movies aren't your thing then Sexy Beast is worth watching for Ben Kingsley's performance as the psychotic Don Logan alone. Every time he appears you can't help but watch as Logan hovers on the edge violence but at the same time appears slightly sad and pathetic. Amazing to think this is the same man who played much gentler characters in Gandhi and Schindler's List.A who's who of British actors provide a strong supporting cast to a great movie.",Sexy Beast

Kingsley (logan) truly stands out in the movie not just by his merits as an actor but by the way Winston (gal), Kendall (aitch), white (dee) and Redman(Jackie)relay a score of unwanted emotions so convincingly . from the nervous fidgeting of Winston to the out of character manner of Kendall in Kingsley's presence . it begs the question ,what is it that this man has done to warrant this behaviour? you'll soon find out . could be interpreted as a little odd but with an open mind on your side you might be talking about this one for years.",Sexy Beast

222,tom-477,At last a gangster movie which keeps it real,10,23 January 2001,"Nice to see something worthy of the title proper British gangster film, in the tradition of Get Carter or The Long Good Friday. Ray Winstone and Cavan Kendall are very believable as the retired crims living in Spain - the vulgarity of their sun tans, gold chains and dark shirts is wonderfully portrayed. Glazer has a great eye for composition and detail, such as the Jackie Collins paperbacks in the background of one shot. The sultry young boy who hangs around Dove s villa is a nice touch - his androgynous beauty a contrast to Dove s understated grossness.The costumes and the detailing in this film make it very satisying and authentic feeling for example Logan, with his shaven bullet head, his wiry frame in nasty blue slacks and white shirt, finished off with prison tattoos on his arms. Right down to the brand of cigarettes he s smoking. Kingsley is really scary as the psychopath, particularly in the way he speaks, which is chillingly authentic.The one thing this film portrays very well is the climate of fear which surrounds anyone in 'the life' Dove and his friends arte like startled bunny rabbits faced with Logan. That sense of always looking over your shoulder and never really being able to relax, or trust another comes across. It s never obvious in this film whose going to be hurt or killed although the limited violence, when it does happen, has an inevitability to it.",Sexy Beast
223,evju,One of the best films of 2000/2001,10,30 August 2001,"""Sexy Beast"" is one of the best romantic movies ever made because romance is what guides the explosive action from beginning to end. This movie avoids bludgeoning us with the requisite chick movie soft-glow shots of pretty boys and girls (though Deedee is easy enough on the eyes), and load-of-crap about ""eternal love"". Instead ""Sexy Beast"" only has to deliver glimpses of realistic, blissful romantic love because the acting is so strong and natural that is all that is needed to convey the depth of emotional attachment that makes the formidable obstacles posed by Don, Teddy and the ""last job.""The cinema photography is impeccable. Some ""wows"" off the top of my head: boulder sequence, floating in night sky underwater embrace, teddy as rabbitman dream sequence, underwater deposit box robbery!!!! (There are more, of yes there are.) Yeah, it has some video/advertising tinges to it, but the touches serve the film superbly.Dialogue is hilarious and playful. The film's pace is fast, but not overly so. The plot is somewhat familiar, but executed so deftly with such fantastic acting that the familiar seemed new.The acting was incredible all around. Perfect casting. I fluctuate daily about who was a better villain, Teddy or Don. Teddy had the inner cool/evil thing going; Don had the wounded pitbull fire burning in his belly. Gal endeared me from the first frame and retained my sympathy and support til the last. All the supporting parts (including the crime gang bit players) were top of the mark .Simply put this is the best movie of 2001 so far, and one of the best movies of all time.

224,chasmiles,Fine crime flick in the tradition of the 70s,8,12 July 2001,"I went to this movie expecting a slick, fast-paced, shallow gangster flick in the tradition of Tarentino and Ritchie. While 90s stylization does sometimes rear its head (especially in the caper sequences), most of SEXY BEAST harkens back to character-driven movies of the 70s. It's more THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY than SNATCH. Characters are defined by their relationships with each other, not their verbal tics. Even Kingsley's loudmouthed heavy is closer to De Niro's brute in RAGING BULL than one of Tarentino's hypereloquent creations. It's a nice change of pace (though, like many 70s movies, it has the occasional problem with pacing and dialogue). You'll enjoy this movie more if you set aside comparisons with Tarentino and Ritchie and take it on its own terms.",Sexy Beast
225,dougk-5,Some of these reviewers are missing the point.,8,11 September 2001,"I think the people giving this movie  a bad review are missing the point of the film. It's not a crime or gangster movie and the comedy is meted out sparingly -as in real life. If you were expecting high jinx comedy or a ""planning the perfect crime"" type film, then stay away from ""Perfect Beast"" . Also, if your command of cockney English is not quite up to par, I suggest you watch ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" a few more times to brush up because, as many previous viewers have mentioned, the dialogue is fast, furious, and VERY cockney and if you blink, you may miss something. That being said, what the film IS about is the battle of wills between sociopath Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) and retired criminal Gal (Ray Winstone).  It's a psychological film, not an action thriller. Imagine ""My Dinner with Andre"" if Andre was a psychopathic killer.The cast is small, as is the location. Most of it takes place in Gal's villa in southern Spain -intensifying the feeling of invasion perpetrated by this unwelcome guest. Everyone's performance is admirable, but they are all dwarfed by Kinsley's Logan. Kingsley gives, by far, one of the most studied performances in psychotic behavior I've yet seen on screen. Don't let anyone else's review fool you. Don Logan is DEEP. This is a character you get the feeling would've been been admitted to psychiatric care as a child if his parents had been better off.    Instead, he's carried his childhood neuroses with him and used them to his best advantage in the criminal world. Every aspect of his  persona, from the obvious discomfort with one-on-one communication (unless of course he's bullying), to the autistic machine gun speech repetitions, to the downright schizophrenic bathroom mirror conversation screams ""Institutionalize me!"" Instead, he's given free reign to terrorize the people around him.Case in point -his speech is peppered with cockney swear words, strung together with such creativity as to make a hungarian taxidriver blush, but when mentioning intimate body parts in real terms (as opposed to colorful epithets), he uses ""bum"" and ""front bottom"". And you can almost see him blush as he says it!Specifically answering the charge that the dialogue is ""tautological and blocky""; Hey, that's the way people talk! Especially people who don't talk much. People have gotten so used to tarentino's criminal monologues that they think hitmen actually give bible speeches before whacking their victims. Fine and good if you want goofy entertainment, but realism is just as valid in a crime film.I know people like the characters in this film (to the point that, in the theatre, we were actually calling out ""holy smokes -that's so-and- so"" and ""that's exactly so-and-so"" -even the Logan character) and these performances were more true to life than any Tarantino",Sexy Beast
226,slhughes20,"I know a bloke, who knows a bloke' and He's about to Have a Stroke.",5,16 June 2002,"Note: A minor spoiler aheadThe opening credits of Sexy Beast tell us all we really need to know. This is one cool film. Did you get that? THIS IS ONE COOL FILM. COOL. COOL. COOL. COOL. After all, Gal (Ray Winstone) puts a towel that has been soaking in ice water on his crotch during the opening credits, to cool off during a particularly torturous sunbathing session. Frankly, I don't know if I could ever be that cool.When cool films are both cool and fun we can sit back and enjoy, knowing that a piece of fluff is about to pass before our eyes. Ocean's Eleven is like that. The cast of that wonderfully entertaining film winks at us for the entire two hours, and we don't mind because we know that they know it is disposable. The charm of the actors carries the day there. However, I couldn't help get over the feeling that everyone in Sexy Beast wanted us to know how cool they were. By the way, did I mention that Sexy Beast is cool??It's a simple story. Gal is retired, as we later learn, from criminal activities. He lives with his ex-porn star wife and two other friends. Their lives are now all that they could not be in gray, damp Britain. That wonderful Spanish sun can get so bloody hot that you need to douse your crotch with ice water. Then, out of that azure sky, Don Logan (Kingsley) arrives with much fanfare-and a good bid of apprehension from our happy four. He has a reputation, it seems. And he doesn't take NO, NO, NO for an answer. He needs to convince Gal to take on one more job. Of course, Gal will say YES, YES, YES. Don's many charms would work on anyone.For all the air conditioning being blown from the screen, Sexy Beast is still a workable thriller with a wonderful performance from Winstone. Yeah, you read right-Winstone gives the standout performance here, much more subtle and controlled than the operatic ranting from Kingsley. It would be easy enough to say that Kingsley is the wrong actor in the wrong part, but the problem is not quite as simple as that.Kingsley's performance is basically one note, with veins popping and nostrils flaring. He yells the part admirably. Logan must be on blood pressure medication; he seems the perfect candidate for a stroke. Unfortunately, director Glazer lets Kingsley rely on his technique and fireworks. An accent and very upright posture masquerade as character development. But don't forget-Kingsley's Logan loves one of the women in the cast. Ah, yes! That must be the character development. This dolt has a heart, even if it is made of stone. He's the Grinch before all the Whos in Whoville sing Welcome Christmas.' Kingsley has come a long way from Gandhi. But Logan hasn't come any distance in the arc of the film.Tension finally begins to build in the last reel of the film, but by that time I wondered if I cared. Who lives and who dies? I'll never tell. Just give me my CD player with Dean Martin in the headphones, and pass me the SPF 30.",Sexy Beast

228,deabaitua,ben kingsley scares me,8,3 July 2001,"like robert carlyle's Begbie in Trainspotting, Ben Kingsley's portrait of don logan captures the unpredictability of the psychopathically violent. He is a hysterically unsettling character and it's hard to reconcile the fact that this is Gandhi playing the most convincing enforcer I've seen. Unlike other British gangster movies, sexy beast captures the unsettling, fearful stink of violence. For a director whose background is in advertising, Glazer does not take refuge in fast-cutting: in the opening, he catches the slow unbearable heat of spain, holding onto one iconic image of ray winstone relaxing by his pool rather than leaping all over the shop.

He's loud, annoying and incoherrent.  In fact, I couldn't understand 2/3 of the movie!  Maybe, again, it's because I'm not British, but I didn't find Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels any trouble to understand.

But his demeanor and aggressive behaviour, together with a smoldering lust for the wives of his former partners, does nothing to entice his buddy from retirement in the idyllic landscape of Spain. A fact Don just can't accept. Making matters worse is Don's raging psychosis, which leads all the characters on an unexpected path.Kingsley's performance is fearless. His every movement screams violence, yet he reins it in until one unbridled moment on which the picture turns.

Glazer, with his music video background, cuts Kingsley and the cast in sharp focus and loud visual, dizzingly back and forth, as if he were directing a scary Goth Emo music video. And it bloody works.UNKLE's Soundtrack is pumping top notch techno stuff, working each scene as if it were a climax at a Rave party.Winstone and the rest of the cast are also spectacular. Winstone, especially, taking the straight man role of this memorable on screen duo, and with that, showing incredible stamina against Kingsley's vicious performance.And lastly Melles & Scinto's script with its simple premise - Don wants him to say yes, but Gal is saying No. Simple premise that's not as confusing as Snatch.There have been critics who have stated the use of the word, C**T, as extremely unnecessary and just over indulgent. But as I watched this film, I realised thats the irony of it: Don Logan IS the biggest C**T in Cinema History.And with that, lets talk about Kingsley performance. The great thing about Don is that he is all ANIMAL - He waits to shut down Gal's verbal retorts quickly like a pouncing tiger and he NEVER moves his eyes (only slightly) - like a Shark. There are times, like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, where I don't know when to laugh or dirtbike my underwear. It is a great performance and showcases a man in battle with his HUMAN instincts for love and companionship.

This is a stunning film debut for the writer/director. The dialogue is convincing. The pacing is superb. My personal favourite scene is that of the restaurant, where Gary (Winston) tries to maintain a cool exterior but simply emphasises how utterly devastating the impending arrival of Kingsley is. Ian McShane is also surprising as the all powerful, twisted crime lord. There are some surreal sequences here which are not to everyone's taste, but I think it actually adds to the realism of the rest of the film.",Sexy Beast
237,jetsetsatellite,A sexy beast of a movie indeed!,10,1 May 2006,"I'm a pretty significant film buff and consider Sexy Beast to be one of the tautest thrillers and finest films I've ever seen. Clocking in at just shy of 90 minutes, director Jonathan Glazer has trimmed all the fat on what is surely a lean, mean, British gangster flick like no other. Winding incredibly well-crafted, clever dialogue into a beautifully photographed, often intense yet wonderfully funny plot, Glazer delivers an instant masterpiece brimming with virtuoso acting performances and inherent re-watchability. Ray Winstone turns in an unbelievably controlled performance as the hopelessly romantic Gal Dove and Ben Kingsley and Ian McShane just chew the scenery to bits as two of the best screen villains since Darth Vader.I would recommend turning the subtitles on for your first viewing as a lot of the dialogue, particular that of the character Aitch, is difficult to decipher through the thick accents.I could go on and on about this movie to freakish detail but will leave it up to you, dear viewer, to investigate. As a fan of film, this is easily one of my favorite, if not most favorite, movies of all time.

All the performances are incredible, most notably Ray Winstone, Amanda Redman and Lovejoy himself, Ian McShane, but as everyone points out, Kingsley just steals the show even when he is not onscreen.

240,cinemonk,Vacuous English crime movie,4,26 September 2001,"This film details the story of Gal, a former criminal who has since retired to Spain to live out his days with his wife.  However, as in too many other crime films, the lead character is pulled in for ""one last job.""   The film primarily concerns itself with the attempts by Don, an old friend and colleague of Gal's, to convince Gal to participate. If you think you've seen this story before, you have, and told better. The only thing to differentiate this film from those going before it is Ben Kingsley's searingly angry performance as Don. One might well expect an actor of his gifts to be able to bring much power to the screen, and he has tried mightily to do so.  But although Kingsley contributes great energy to his role, unfortunately the role itself is so thinly written that there is no additional dimension to it, so Kingsley spends most of his screen time going from angry to fulminating rage, with little other dimension to his character. If the hackneyed plot and one-dimensionality of the characters aren't incentive enough to avoid this film, there is also the small matter of the directing.  In a way, it's kind of a remarkable achievement, to the extent that although there is a consistent visual and narrative style, the direction manages consistently to come across as arch and contrived, rather than in the service of the characters and the narrative.  The direction seems to stand outside the movie, snickering at the characters, or pointing to them with an elbow in the audience's ribs to say, ""Oh, look at him, isn't that cool.""  This treatment might have been tolerable in a action-driven heist film, but it's completely out of place in what is putatively a character study.  So instead of relating to the characters and feeling what they're going through, the audience merely sees the actors on the screen, speaking, moving, standing still, but always the audience is emotionally, psychologically, spiritually distanced. So without an original plot, without entertaining dialogue or action, without multi-dimensional characters, and without any real insights into the human condition, it's impossible to recommend this film to anyone.  I give it four stars only because it was adequately exposed, the sound was adequately recorded and mixed, and the actors made an effort, albeit a wasted effort.",Sexy Beast

243,Jonathan E,Highly original thug thriller,10,27 June 2001,"Contemporary London and Spain's Costa Brava has never looked better in this stunning film. Jonathan Glazer 's original take on bank robbery, love, and hiding is a truly  impressive debut.  If you've seen his previous work, its incredible how he manages to put his stamp on this film. Grab bag of weirdness, fun, suspense, surrealism, shock, and horror make 88 minutes feel like two hours. Ben Kingsley and Ray Winestone's performance is  fan-bloody- tastic. Impeccable dialogue and lethal delivery - understated and frightening. Way better than Walken & Hopper in ""True Romance"" , Travolta & Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"".  Watch out for Winestone's alter egos: pool boy and something entirely different never seen before. What Glazer superbly handles in three minutes is even more outrageous, disturbing and gratifying than Uncle Fester's half hour 'fraternity party"" in Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Although I like some visual techniques in ""Snatch"", Glazer outdoes Guy Ritchie visually, editorially and outperforms him in casting, dialogue, tension and mania. Glazer's onto Nic Roeg's weird elliptical sensibility that is so wonderfully refreshing in this age of 'follow by the book storyline as dicated by accounting, marketing and developing heads.

244,pc017,Possibly the worst film I have ever seen. In fact it is!,1,18 July 2001,"This was a blind watch as the cinema which i went ot see it had no posters advertising the film - I now know why! Until now I had never walked out of a movie before in my life - until I watched this one!My initial view was that it was slow moving and to give it a chance to recover. Although the acting was not particularly bad, unfortunately the directing and the story line was. The acting eventually deteriorated into a farce and the storyline did not improve.One of the key scenes and the only one to make me laugh was when the two main male characters and the pool boy go hunting in the desert. The pool boy attempts to kill a rabbit with a blunderbuss and knocks himself over backwards. The one but i found funny. One of the men then attempts to kill the rabbit only for his gun to fall apart.The theme of the rabbit recurs later as Gal is having a nightmare about Don Logan coming to ask him to do a job for him. This is totally farcical as he is dreaming of a flashback to when the 4 characters were sitting having dinner when the news that Don was coming and wanted Gal to do a job for him. the camrea pan's back to see Gal on his own in the desert at the table on his own eating. He is oblivious to the fact that he is alone dining at a table in the middle of the desert as a Rider on a horse approaches from the distance.As the rider slowly approaches you can make out that he is carrying a gun....as he gets closer you see that it is in fact a man with the human legs but a rabbit torso and head. Surreal is not the word. Even at this point the make-up of the actor playing the ""Rabbit"" is terrible.
At this point my patience gave up and we left!If you do consider wanting to see this film wait till it comes on TV. It certainly is not worth the money to see it in the cinema. Even the picture and sound quality is badly reproduced. The most ironic thing about it is that is is by FilmFour whose motto is ""Life's too short for bad films"".",Sexy Beast
245,kossmehl,A pleasant surprise,8,24 July 2001,"SOME MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD....... I avoided Sexy Beast on it's initial release in the UK, because it sounded like another Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see. Just caught up with it on DVD and glad to say, I was wrong. There is some of the same selfconscious directorial bravado at work here, but at least for the first hour this is a tense, darkly funny psychodrama that breathes new life into the retired-gangster-is-lured-back-for-last-job-genre.What really made the film for me is it's offbeat casting and the relationships between the characters, which really made me care for them. Initially it looks like we are dealing with the usual tough guy clichees familiar from early Tarantino and his imitators. Then you realize that Gal genuinely doesn't want to resume his former life because he is happy and deeply in love with his wife and the film becomes involving on an emotional level.Both Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley are cast against type and it pays off extremely well. The former, usually cast as a heavy is soft and vulnerable but with an edge that makes one wonder if he will snap at some point and Ben Kingsley is hilariously nasty as the ultimate foulmouthed villain. I would have not recognized him if I hadn't known before he was in this. Don Logan is the kind of bully who homes in on his victims insecurities and psychologically tears away at them until he wins. Later we find out he has his own insecurities, which deepens character, but makes him no less scary. The two women are great too and are far from the bimbo molls you'd expect them to be in this kind of film. Ian McShane, who I only knew from bland television parts, is an unexpected delight.The let down of the film is it's last third. The first hour is almost like a stage play, just five characters in one location and a situation that grows ever more tense. I didn't want this to end with an action scene, especially one you'd expect in a film of this genre. Still it's a short film at under 90 minutes and until the last 20 minutes or so it's a great return for the British gangster film and it certainly kicks Guy Ritchies butt.",Sexy Beast

Beneath the surface he's lonely, isolated, fragile and desperately craves acceptance, especially from the woman he's obsessed with, and he's frustrated and confused by his inability to achieve that acceptance. The casting is perfect. The acting is outstanding. As an American though, I practically needed a translator to understand what they were saying with their thick British accents. I loved the movie.

Continuing where 'Performance' left off (it even features James Fox) this movie has stand-out performances from all of it's cast, with Ben Kingsley (as Don Logan) producing the scariest bad-guy in cinema since Dennis Hopper's 'Frank'. Ray Winstone & Amanda Redmond are perfectly cast, with Winstone flinching superbly from the terrifying aggression exuded by Kingsley and, to a lesser extent, McShane. Ian McShane does a lot to bury his lightweight 'Lovejoy' persona with an excellent, menacing performance that contrasts well against Winstone's thin bravado, but the honours here have to go to Kingsley who is simply stunning, turning in a masterclass performance and proving (once again) that he is a top-drawer actor with every aspect of his character (posture; accent; attitude) finally honed and utterly (appallingly) convincing.Kingsley's scenes set the movie alight (like the stunning airport sequence, and of course the return to the villa) and it would be interesting to know just how much of the dialogue comes from the excellent script and how much (if any) was improvised.

Waiting the entire 75 minutes for a point to it all was a waste of time.  The only redeeming thing was seeing Ben Kingsley in an odd role but his role was short-lived.  The other redeeming thing was that I only wasted $3 to rent it as opposed to $6.50 each.",Sexy Beast
259,bevan-powrie,Cheering all the way,10,12 September 2016,"Ignore the moronic review by ""Tiggyboo""... who in typically shallow American hubris clearly doesn't get the genius of this film. A seductive, top-class, sopisticated, gratingly tense film, from any director.. however this is Glazer's first and it surpasses Guy Ritchie's stylised and humorous yet shallow efforts. Great photography, brilliant electronic soundtrack and an skilled cast. Nil By Mouth's Ray Winstone, and Ghandi's Ben Kingsley. Both are cleverly cast against type; Winstone is the quite Gal, a retired criminal living with his wife, mate and his mate's wife in a fun, sun-baked escape in Spain. Kingsley's psychopathic Don Logan drives a truck through the peace when arrives and orders Gal to go back to London for one last job. Kingsley is astounding, as his character psychologically tears the skin off Gal, his wife, their friends in a severity unseen in any of the so-called movie villains. Kingsley now joins that list in an unforgettable role in one of 2000's best movies. A solid, well-written, and as unpredictable plot as Don Logan could be.",Sexy Beast
260,Kings4577,I am so glad people are still talking about this movie!,9,29 March 2011,"I couldn't resist the urge to speak my piece about this wonderful work of cinema. Being a connoisseur of mobster movies i.e. The Godfather,Goodfellas,Casino,The Untouchables; ""Sexy Beast"" came upon me when I looked up the resume of Ben Kingsley years ago shortly after this movie came out. I have to say that watching a gangster movie was never more enjoyable than this one.You could say that there is a lot of different dynamics to the movie and storyline that keeps you entertained. Personally the dialog is ""fan dabby dozy tastic"" though at first I didn't quite understand the cockney accent that was presented. Through years of watching I thoroughly enjoy the banter of Don Logan,the uneasiness of Gal, and the subtleties of each character including the sneaky leader of the hired henchmen Teddy Bass played hauntingly by Ian McShane.The humor that is peppered throughout the film is great. Whether its Gal speaking ""Boulder"" under the pool water to an unknowing Dee Dee; or the rabbit hunting incident when Aitch and his toy gun goes ""clunk"" and disassembles when Gal is speaking at the restaurant with his close friends.The setting and locales were enjoyable and Gal's Spanish villa overlooking the town glistens and has an air of complete paradise about it. The pool a perfect solace for a retired,loyal and reserved specialist. The underwater heist scene crazy and unbelievable as it was seemed creative and fun to watch as each moment unfolded.I can't forget the music that fits in very well with the mood of the movie too. It lead you through the highs and lows that happen during this roller coaster ride. A scene that jumps to mind is the short walk Gal has to take to talk to Teddy about the disappearance of Don Logan when in London. The electronic beat pounds as to let u know what Gal is feeling at that very moment he is walking to uncertain doom.Never have I seen two more disturbing and different characters in one film portrayed so well with Ben Kingsley and Ian McShane. Each able to show menace and be so convincing. One pushing with such max force and filth in language while diminutive in stature. The other speaking slow and deliberate, eyes piercing through you like you weren't even there. Funny thing is they both got their way one way or another. As Teddy put it, ""There's a way...there's always a f*****g way."" I could ramble on and on but don't let the naysayers cloud your augment. Look at all the factors in this movie to make your opinion count. Many of the reviews of this film are very upbeat compared to the smaller group of haters. Ill give the negative crowd some credit though considering some of my friends and wife considered it average. Isn't that what this world is about though,freedom of choice and speech. To those seeking a fun,throw a movie in and lose yourself for 89 minutes ride this will do. R.I.P. Cavan Kendall Aka Aitch.",Sexy Beast
261,charlie-brown007,"Not Kingsley's best, B-Movie",1,12 March 2008,"This is the worst pile of trash I've had to sit down and watch in a long time.Ben Kingsley showed he can't play every side of the coin in playing this role.He's not made out for it.It was a total embarrassment to watch, mainly because it was Ben Kingsley that was trying to act in this role.I almost cried for him, it was such a wasteful, total run out the door embarrassment.I don't care what anyone says, this is trash as far as I'm concerned.I turned it off after 20 minutes!!!",Sexy Beast
262,Graham90,Not what you'd expect from a British gangster movie.,9,5 November 2002,"You know after the first few minutes of the film that this isn't going to be another run of the mill gangster movie about 'one last job' that will probably go wrong. Instead, Sexy Beast turns out to be anything but predictable.Ray Winstone plays 'Gal', a retired crook now living in Spain with his wife and enjoying his nights out with friends 'Rich' and 'Jackie'. This ideal lifestyle is shattered for all of them however when an 'old friend' from London decides to come over to persuade Gal in to taking 'one last job' back in England.The film just seems to flow along perfectly thanks to first time director Jonathon Glazer and the performances from the cast are all excellent, particularly Ben Kingsley as the psychotic 'Don Logan'.
Although a very tense film with a few shocking moments throughout, there are also several good laughs to be had along the way and the soundtrack always catches the mood perfectly.Definitely one of the best films I have seen recently and also an excellent example of British film talent.",Sexy Beast

At the same time, we both said, ""Oh yes."" A beautifully photographed, acted, and edited film. The cross cutting between the heist and Don being pummeled by the ex-pats, is alone enough to tell you that you're in great story-telling hands.If you get it, you'll love it.",Sexy Beast

I'm a radio-TV-film graduate from U.T. Austin,Texas(you know, where Rodriquez, Linklater and Tarantino work- whose films by-the-way make this movie look like the toilet paper it is.) I'm telling you, the only reason to keep this film around is to show people how NOT to make a movie. Do yourself a favor and see Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; Snatch; Pulp Fiction; Bottle Rocket and see how it's supposed to be done. Don't give me any of that crap about how I can't ""understand"" this movie. If you in fact are insane enough to like this movie, then go ahead and buy ""I'll Sleep when I'm Dead"" and keep yourself distracted instead of misleading more viewers.

Ben Kingsley is mesmerising as the last person you'd ever want to be acquainted with, and all the other performance are excellent.The villainy is on a (more credible) par with Frank in Blue VelvetI see a few comments about it being hard to understand for non-English viewers - I can only say persevere/turn on the subtitles.
10/10 for me.",Sexy Beast

A story of a gangland thief who has gotten as far away from his past with the love of his life and what transpires when that life tries to take him back. I can't say any more without spoiling it except to say it is subtle, touching and very funny coupled with some truly chilling moments.",Sexy Beast
268,glojazz,What a piece of work !!!,10,23 July 2005,"I'm an actress and the work in this film by EVERYBODY took my breath away. Watching it on TV, I felt like I had a great book and just couldn't put it down while most films bore me enough that I will tape the end and maybe watch it later. How intriguing! And big time kudos to the casting director.....I want to work for that person. The entire cast was just so perfect......their looks, actions, etc. The reviewer who said Kingsley was the best thing in it and the story was weak must have seen a different film.No one has to say anything about Kingsley's always fabulous work but I was blown away by the authenticity and charisma that Ray Winston as Gary (Gal) Dove and Amanda Redman as DeeDee Dove exuded. My eyes were glued to their every warm, wonderful move.......the warmth exuding even when their role demanded a hardness. LOVED IT! LOVED THEM!",Sexy Beast
269,ericheinze111,"Interesting, really interesting",9,10 July 2004,"Sexy Beast is a very bizard film, I accept that. But it's one of the best bizard films I have seen. The plot is simple: a retired gangster, Gal (Ray Winstone) lives in a nice country house in Spain. He lives with his wife and two friends. They are all happy, but then.... Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) is coming to town.The four friends are afraid of Logan, I mean really afraid. Logan did jobs with Gal. And he wants him to do the last one job... and he won't take a ""no"" for an answer.The performances are amazing. Ben Kingsley is like a train without brakes and Winstone is simply marvelous. Very strong performances that really give life to the characters.There are strange scenes in the movie, so if you don't like these kind of scenes, don't worry, they are very well made and they are just a couple.The dialogues are very, very, very, very intense. They are just great.For some, this is a fabulous movie (me included), and for others is just an interesting good film. Watch it!",Sexy Beast
270,andyr0ck,Such a low score...,8,26 July 2006,"...for such a belter of a movie. Story: simple but effective. Casting: inspired; who could have thought Ian McShane (i mean, ""Lovejoy""!) could be so evil? And, obviously, Ben Kingsley as the terrifying Logan. Direction: classy but not gimmicky (i'm looking at you, here, Guy Ritchie!)Whilst i'm shocked at this not having an 8 score, i can see why this might not be everyone's cup of tea; the language can be rather course and this is a psychological drama between the main characters, rather than a rampaging monster of an action movie.If you like your gangster movies with a bit more brains, see this. If you're a fan of any of the actors starring in it, it's a must-see.",Sexy Beast
271,slytherin_heiress,Brilliant dark gangster comedy!,8,25 January 2005,"The story follows Gary Dove who, living in Spain with his wife, has his past catch up with him (in the shape of Don Logon). Don urges Gary to go to London for one last heist but it goes wrong for the both of them.The movie was brilliant. For a first time movie director, Jonothan Glazer has done a fantastic job! Ray Winstoine's performance as Gary is brilliant but overshadowed by the equally brilliant Ben Kingsley.Sexy Beast has all the elements of a gangster/crime film, adding dark humour and touching moments to it.To keep it short, i highly recommend this movie and give it an 8 out of 10.",Sexy Beast
272,sez_inabox,"Film's OK, needs better title",5,26 January 2005,"OK so Sexy Beast could be a bit misleading a the title and that really bugs me as it is kind of pointless in relation to the film.The film is good, good actors, good camera-work, good editing, basically good all-round, although I wouldn't be in a rush to see it again. There were certain bits that got me interested, for instance the break-in, that was about it. Ben Kingley's performance was amazing and his character had me laughing endlessly, the rest of the cast was pretty dull although Amanda Redman had some good moments.Overall I think it was OK and would be good to watch once, but thats it.",Sexy Beast
273,powderworks1979,F#$@in Brilliant!,8,8 November 2006,"I liken this masterpiece to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' for two reasons. One is the similarity they share in that you're not sure it's OK to be laughing at the content and secondly each film is in two halves, changing pace slightly after the main characters die. Glazer has managed to add a touch of class though that Kubrick didn't. The second half of Sexy Beast is still charging and the flashbacks of Don dying keep the viewers pulse pumping. Ben Kingsley was born to play this role. He was robbed of the Oscar. Try watching Ghandi and this back to back, then you'll see what a great actor is. One of the best of all time. Ray Winstone is also perfect and the two of them together compliment each other nicely like a kind of steroid and sun induced Odd Couple. Don Logan is absolutely frightening which I'd be able to notice more if I wasn't huddled over laughing so much every time I watch it. The scene in the kitchen with Gal in his dressing gown and Don firing into him looks like a very upset football coach voicing his disappointment in his star player. It's so impressive the actors don't look like they're acting and the fear on everyone but Don's face says this. Glazer's direction is stunning as is the soundtrack and production. This film is a masterpiece. Anybody who doesn't see that can go back to watching My Three Sons and listening to Neil Diamond ya ponce.",Sexy Beast
274,noda0001,Sexy Beast is a feast,9,12 May 2005,"This film is a surprise. Never before have I felt that simplicity could truly be a strong point for a film. I cannot stress that enough. Sexy Beast has a relatively simple story. It revolves heavily on your sympathy with the main couple, Gal and Dee (Ray Winstone and Amanda Redman). On the surface, this fits into the genre of the gritty mob or heist film. At the heart though is a modern fairytale about a dedicated marriage in times of trouble.Everyone raves about Ben Kingsley's intense performance as a mob thug, Don. Indeed, seeing the dark side of Ghandi one cannot argue that Kingsley is a superb chameleon. This tidbit of star-power that the movie has tends to let people forget that the rest of the actors are equally amazing. Ian McShane (now of HBO's Deadwood fame) has relatively little screen time but a harsh and lasting presence.One note of humanity to point out in this crime flick is the uncommonly expressed simple fear of committing a crime. Another is the steady nod to the basic relationship of a married couple in their 40s. Dodging between such themes, you even find humor sometimes in someone's absurd cruelty, sometimes in a joke between friends. Some may argue that Sexy Beast is slow, I say it is methodical and intelligent.",Sexy Beast
275,philip-216,should be revisited,9,20 June 2005,"no one disputes that this is a good film. But with age it seems to me to be a bit more. the age of the characters demand that a been there done that mindset be adopted for the viewing. the director, coming fresh from a music video background into his first feature let's the material work without the gloss and just a well placed touch of guilty fun. It would be simple to say it's just a good film stopped from being placed into a more accomplished category because it's style at first glance seems to frame it with that English 'trainspoting thru two barrels' shaggy dog genre that many have come to expect as it's intention. Of course anyone seeing the film knows this not to be the case but i point it out because how exactly when making up your mind about this feature do you shelve it? For me at least i have come to give it a more unique classification. have a glass of wine and give it another play. Let me rephrase that ... let it play and go along for the ride.",Sexy Beast

277,waits-45391,This movie is a disaster...Spoiler alert...,1,21 October 2018,"If you're scanning reviews to decide whether or not to watch this film let me save you some time. First, Ben Kingsley and Ian McShane have done some great films and TV series . This is not one of them. This is one of the most improbable and ridiculous films ever made. I don't know how else to describe it.The dialogue consists of the most stilted and jarring string of words ever put together. The conversations are bizarre and awkwardly funny all at the same time.The story is very simple. Ben Kingsley's character, Don Logan verbally assaults Ray Winstone's character Gal for a couple days to do ""one last job"". Apparently, they were both big time gangsters in the past. Gal tries to refuse. Extreme violence ensues. Gal does the job anyway. Ian McShane does have a part in the job but his talent as an actor is completely wasted in this film so I will spare you the details because you should avoid this film at all costs.The job is, of course, one last big heist. Again, the details of this film are not important except that it is so unbelievable you will catch yourself staring at the screen with your head sideways (like a confused dog) trying to imagine wtf the director was thinking when he thought this up.But, if you really have nothing to do you can watch it to the end to find out what happens. I was only able to finish the film because it was so strange to see how convincing Ben Kingsley was as a total psychopath.Which is the only reason I gave this movie a star.",Sexy Beast
