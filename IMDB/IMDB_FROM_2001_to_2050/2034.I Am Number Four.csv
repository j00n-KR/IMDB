0,bkoganbing,With Powers And Abilities Far Beyond Everybody Else On Earth,5,12 September 2011,"I Am Number Four casts young Alex Pettyfer as someone who looks like your typical teenage kid with the usual teen angst issues because he keeps moving from place to place with Tim Olyphant who Alex says is his father. He looks like any ordinary kid, but he's really Superboy of a sort.Like Kalel he came to earth with powers and abilities far beyond just about everyone else. Olyphant is not his dad, Pettyfer's parents were killed by some nasty invaders called Mogadorians and they're on earth searching for 9 special kids just like Pettyfer who will lead the counterrevolution back on their world if in fact the Mogadorians don't settle here on earth because they're liking what they see in the way of conquest spoils.In addition to Superman, I counted some elements taken from some forgotten television series, The Powers Of Matthew Star and The Invaders. Anyway young Pettyfer also gets involved with earth girl Dianna Agron getting her jock boyfriend Jake Abel all bent out of shape. His best friend in a very touching performance is science nerd Callan McAuliffe, he's by far the best one in the film.They have a knockdown drag out with the aliens at the high school where even Pettyfer's basset hound gets in the act, let me not say how.The ending is an open ended one which might lead to sequels or even a television series. I Am Number Four is an all right film for the juvenile market that even a few adults might enjoy.",I Am Number Four
1,Leofwine_draca,"So, Twilight for boys. But does it work?",5,28 April 2014,"The producers of I AM NUMBER FOUR made no bones about the demographic for their movie: this is, in essence, TWILIGHT aimed at teenage boys, who could identify with a high school loner character who turns out to be an alien refugee being hunted by some other aliens. The real question is whether the film manages to be successful in its own right.For the first half, it's actually not bad. Alex Pettyfer, despite being obnoxiously pretty, is a much better lead than the depressing Kristen Stewart, and he carries the film pretty well. Timothy Olyphant (THE CRAZIES) lends some solid support as the father figure, and the whole high-school-reject type thing is quite watchable despite being overly familiar and clichéd.Sadly, the film becomes more and more predictable as it goes on, and needless to say it all ends up in a noisy CGI action set-piece as do so many these days. Before then, though, it has promise despite the flaws. Such flaws include DJ Caruso's indifferent direction and the weak-ass villains, who look like rejects from BLADE 2. Fans of teenage fantasy/sci-fi flicks are sure to enjoy it, however.",I Am Number Four
2,SnoopyStyle,Lots of nagging questions,5,22 December 2013,"Alex Pettyfer plays an alien who is on the run from another alien race who destroyed his world. Timothy Olyphant plays his guardian. He and others are charmed and can only be killed in order. He is number four and next in line to be killed.Firstly, the movie needs to explain their situation better. It's very convoluted and it leads to many questions. None of it is explained well. And why does he have to go to high school? I understand that's what the writer requires for a tween book, but it makes no sense. If he's hiding out, why would he be in public? Why risk being revealed with his glowing hands? There are a lot of whys.If you can get past the whys, it's a hyper teen drama with really pretty people. It has some watchable action, and some watchable teen drama. The high school douche is really douchey. The hot girl is really pretty. And the lead is impetuous, and stupid. The CGI is pretty good, but it gets very chaotic and very big at the end. The whole thing is a bit of a mess.",I Am Number Four
3,Prismark10,That twilight feeling,4,12 April 2017,"I Am Number Four is aimed at young adults. After the death of Number Three we see loner John (Alex Pettyfer) a teenage alien on Earth who has fled his planet from the Mogadorians and he moves swiftly from one town to another. The Mogadorians are killing the remaining survivors some of who are like John with special powers.John is now targeted to be killed and he goes on the run with his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant) as they hide in another small town where John develops and learns to use his powers but his foes are after him but not before he finds time for a bit of romance.The film is sluggish and messy. I just found it difficult to get into it, maybe because I am not the target audience. The film has some good special effects and action scenes but really it follows the template of many of these Young Adult adaptations.",I Am Number Four
4,claudio_carvalho,Highly Entertaining Adventure,8,30 July 2011,"In Florida, the teenager Daniel (Alex Pettyfer) is a successful and popular athlete at school. While swimming with the teenager Nicole (Emily Wickersham) in a party at the beach, a blue light marks the leg of Daniel scaring Nicole and their friends.On the next morning, he runs with Henri (Timothy Olyphant) in their truck to another place. During the trip, Daniel recalls that he was born in the planet Lorien and Henri, who is supposed to be his father, is actually a warrior from his planet assigned to keep him alive. When he was a kid, the Mogadorians invaded his planet and killed all the population. Only nine children with abilities had escaped and they are hunted down by the Mogadorians. When the three first children were murdered, he got three scars on his leg and now he knows that he is the next.When they arrive in Paradise, Ohio, Henri changes the identity of Daniel to John Smith and asks him to keep low profile. However, John decides to enroll at the Paradise Regional Senior High-School, where he falls in love for his mate Sarah (Dianna Agron), who is an aspirant photographer that posts pictures in her website Strangers in Paradise. He also befriends the outcast and bullied Sam (Callan McAuliffe), whose father Malcolm disappeared at the border of Mexico and he claims that he has been abducted by aliens. Sooner John discovers that his legacy is a powerful gift and he must learn how to control it since the evil Mogadorians are coming. ""I Am Number Four"" was a great surprise for me with a highly entertaining adventure. The story seems to be a pilot of a television show and fans of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicle"" and ""Smallville"" will certainly enjoy this film as much as I did. The plot has the usual flaws of this type of film, with the complete destruction of the school without any witness or clothing that does not burn, and the clichés such as a teen romance and the bully at school, but maybe that is why it is so good.The character Number Six ""steals"" the film with her appearance in the high-school. The Extras of the DVD show that Teresa Palmer worked-out a lot to perform the role of Number Six. The dog Bernie is another great attraction. In the end, I hope to see a sequel or a TV show of this pleasant story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Eu Sou o Número Quatro"" (""I am the Number Four"")",I Am Number Four
5,nogodnomasters,SCIENCE FICTION FOR TEENS,8,16 July 2018,"There are two alien races on this planet. One is trying to kill the other one. The good guys look like blond surfers and the bad guys look like Darth Maul. Three of the good guys are dead. The fourth one (4 of 9) has relocated to Paradise, Ohio and is attempting to keep a low profile, but insists on going to school. Here he meets a pretty blond who is also a photographer. There are the jocks who insist he stay away from her and the class science/UFO geek who is picked on by the Jocks.Our hero, whose name is John Smith is going through alien puberty where he develops more superhuman powers. Through it all he must cope with the ""agony"" of high school, dating pretty girls, and in his spare time, defeat an alien race out to destroy him. Definitely a teen movie. It has the potential to have a sequel as well as being a TV series. No sex or nudity.",I Am Number Four
6,kosmasp,By the numbers,4,18 December 2011,"I mean seriously, with a title like that, what should we expect? Exactly! A movie that is done by the numbers. And not in a really good way. Though not a total failure either. It's just disappointing to see this cliché-ridden movie and imagine what could've been there, if only they really tried. While beautiful (Pettyfer or Ms. Palmer, depending on your taste) and nicely framed, with special effects that are decent enough, it all feels as old as the computer you bought 3 years ago. And normally, that means you don't use that computer anymore ...What does matter is, that teenagers will be satisfied (and I'm not trying to tell you how ""cool"" this movie is), as they were with the other recent directorial efforts from DJ Caruso (Disturbia, with one of the worst fake scares ever ... and I use that term lightly! ... and of course Eagle Eye with Mr. Transformer himself). So I guess what I'm saying is, if you liked the movie, I gave you another two to watch. And if you didn't ... well you know what to do/avoid",I Am Number Four
7,Tweekums,Decent enough teenage fantasy/sci-fi,6,19 March 2017,"When the planet Lorien was attacked by the Mogadorians nine children were sent to Earth, each protected by a guardian. It is only a matter of time before the Mogadorians track them down and when they do they must unite to defeat them. Each of the nine has a number and for some reason they can only be found in order; 'John Smith' is Number Four and Number Three has just been killed. The children look human but they have special powers which develop as they age and after John accidentally reveals his, his Guardian, Henri, decides it is time for them to move.They head to Paradise, Ohio, where John enrols in the local high school; here he quickly gets on the wrong side of the school bullies when he defends their preferred victim, Sam, and is attracted to Sarah, the ex-girlfriend of the group's leader. This is the least of his worries though; the Mogadorians are closing him on him; when they catch up with him he will have to trust his new friends as he faces his attackers; luckily Number Six has also found him and will fight alongside him.When I sat down to watch this I didn't know anything about it, I just thought it was a catchy title and the blurb on the DVD box suggested it might be worth a watch. While I wouldn't say it was a great film it was interesting enough. There was a decent sense of mystery about John and the other eight children sent to Earth; unfortunately some details were never properly explained; most notably why are they numbered and why can they only be found in order? The early part of the film where he is going to school serves to introduce the ordinary human characters and showcase John's growing skills but it isn't as good as the second half as the Mogadorians provide a real threat. This provides some fairly spectacular fights with some impressive CGI effects. The cast is decent enough even if many of their characters are a bit too cliché. The conclusion is a bit disappointing as it clearly isn't the end of the story whether a sequel will ever be made is a mystery but it really needs one to wrap up the story. Overall I'd say this is a decent enough fantasy/sci-fi for teenage viewers; not a must see but a reasonable way of passing a couple of hours if you like the genre.",I Am Number Four
8,paul_haakonsen,Adequate story spiced up with eyecandy CGI effects...,6,4 June 2012,"Having seen ""I Am Number Four"" just now, I sit here with an odd sensation like I had just seen ""Dawson's Creek"" exposed to a heavy element of Sci-Fi.I was initially told that this movie was quite good by a former colleague, and had a friend say it was nothing more than a, and I quote, ""pretty picture movie"". But still I decided to give it a go. I must admit that I did find the movie to be good entertainment, but there just was a tad too much late teen/early adulthood romance over it (read ""Dawsons Creek"" here), which brought the movie down a notch. I liked the Sci-Fi element to the story, and the plot was actually good enough to keep me interested from the start up to the very end.The special effects in ""I Am Number Four"" were, as to be expected, quite good. Lots of flashy effects and CGI. The fight and action scenes were nicely choreographed and made good use of the CGI effects. And when they brought out the energy weapons, well that was just fantastic. I loved those. And also the two monstrous (alien) creatures were nicely made as well - that chimera and the other flying reptilian-like alien. They looked realistic and had some nice details.""I Am Number Four"" had some good people on the cast list, and it was really Alex Pettyfer (playing John Smith) who carried the movie most of the time. His performance was good and charismatic, and he was well-cast for the role.However, this is far from being amongst the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen, but it is entertaining enough, and does provide a good 110 minutes of action-packed fun with lots of colorful, flashy CGI effects. The movie could have used more time on presenting the background of John Smith, his home planet and the idea behind those chosen nine. It seemed to just skip superficially over that fact, which was a shame.Sadly, I doubt that ""I Am Number Four"" will be a movie that will be fresh in memory a year after having seen it, nor do I believe that I will be making a second watching of it, as it just didn't have enough depth to sustain a second watching.",I Am Number Four
9,michaelRokeefe,Not your typical high school hunk.,8,6 August 2011,"John Smith(Alex Pettyfer)is Number 4 of nine aliens that have left their planet in hopes of finding peace on Earth. Looking human, John tries passing as a high school teen and his traveling guardian Henri(Timothy Olyphant)keeps warning him about attracting attention. Existence on Earth is not easy when you have pursuers from your former home planet tracking you to destroy you. The enemy killers are required to kill the nine in numerical order...the first three have met their death already. The Mogadorian Commander(Kevin Durand)and his crew have honed in and already killed Henri. Number Four has realized that he has inherited some unique special powers and he will need to use them to protect himself and his human girlfriend, Sarah(Dianna Agron). Arriving to put up a stronger fight is Number 6(Teresa Palmer). Some will find unanswered story line questions, but just go with it and enjoy the action and special effects in this Sci-Fi thriller. Also in the cast: Jake Abel, Callan McAuliffe and Emily Wickersham. The finale pretty well seals the deal on a sequel.",I Am Number Four
10,zardoz-13,A Fore-Gone Conclusion,6,25 March 2011,"Director D.J. Caruso really blew it with ""I Am Number Four."" This sci-fi, action thriller about good aliens hiding out on Earth while bad aliens track them down to exterminate them with extreme prejudice looks like a pilot episode for a WB show. Derivative, predictable, and half-baked sum up this lackluster actioneer that squanders Timothy Olyphant in a supporting role as a surrogate dad. The trials and tribulations that our protagonist, John Smith (Alex Pettyfer of ""Beastly"") endures is reminiscent of ""Smallville."" However, ""I Am Number Four"" is no ""Smallville."" John has to maintain a low-profile or some goofy-looking, trenchcoat-clad villains with gills on either side of their noses and elaborate tattoos on their shaved heads will ice him. They race around in black vehicles and haul two monstrous space critters in a truck that they have used to kill people like our protagonist. They have slain three of the aliens, and John is the fourth one on their list. John is still in the process of learning his incredible powers when he stumbles across a blond babe who likes to snap photos of him. Suddenly, the Internet is rift with photos and videos of John. Teens will enjoy this more than adults who have seen this plot many times before. ""I Am Number Four"" is inferior compared with either ""Eagle Eye"" or the infinitely better ""Disturbia."" The surprises are few and far between and the action goes into hyper-activity when a female warrior, Number 6 (Teresa Palmer of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"")from the same planet that John came from shows up and behaves like Laura Croft.",I Am Number Four
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Hey, at least the title tells you it's crap two times over",6,17 March 2011,"A young man with superpowers is hunted by a group that want him dead, and yet he still falls for a girl, thus risking her life. But enough about Jumper. In this one, ""John"" and those who chase him are aliens, and these Mogadorians have to kill these 9 survivors(including Kal-El) from the planet in a specific order, because... I have no idea. Also, his hands are turquoise lighthouses(and it's as if the crew don't realize how dorky and lame this looks, as they constantly use it). The majority of this is a clichéd, vapid high school drama(that borders Twilight territory... and yes, there are apparently books behind this, I didn't know they existed), and then this suddenly remembers that it was advertised as a sci-fi action flick, so it becomes one for the last half hour or so. And then it sequel-baits about as shamelessly as it possibly could. I guess they hope that you forget that the last third of this was in no way representative of the whole, as well as the fact that we simply do not connect with these people. For the first half, we don't even know what the stakes are! These bland, forgettable characters, spewing obvious trailer-lines(Bay, get out of this business, it's getting tiresome), making stupid mistakes, and being acted poorly. The bad guy is sadistic and enjoyable enough. Olyphant as the sarcastic, overbearing guardian is cool enough... he nearly always is. Maybe the Smallville writers just can't compose a story that is self-contained. I recommend this to people who want what this actually is and not what it purported to be. 6/10",I Am Number Four
12,view_and_review,4 is for your rating,4,6 July 2013,"You could be number four or 44, it still wouldn't have made a difference- this movie was terrible. Never mind that the story itself wasn't that good, but I never felt drawn to the protagonist. He was a very empty hero. Why should I care about a fourth, fifth, first or last alien being whacked? It wasn't E.T. they were chasing. The movie was predictable and disappointing... or maybe it was disappointingly predictable; either way it was difficult to watch.This movie kept itself from the rubble by having some nice effects and action. Besides that there was nothing very captivating. Somehow I was able to manage to watch the entire movie, for that I deserve a good rating. If there is a part two I figure it has to be better because they can only go up.",I Am Number Four
13,neil-476,"Enjoyable, high production values, bit of a shambles",7,4 March 2011,"During a beach party, ""teenager"" ""John"" (Alex Pettyfer) goes for a sneaky nocturnal dip with a bikini beauty, only to have her exit the sea, screaming, when a bright light starts shining out of his leg. We know that this signals the death of ""Number Three"" deep in a jungle somewhere (because we have just seen this happen), and that John is ""Number Four"" in a list of 9 survivors of the genocide perpetrated on the planet Lorien by evil conquerors the Mogadorians, who have tattooed bald heads, long black coats, pointy teeth, and gills on each side of their noses. We know all this because ""John"" has told is in an opening voice-over which is the film's first big mistake - it would have been better served by us learning the backstory in bits and pieces. Anyway John and his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant)(hang on, doesn't that make 10 survivors?) up sticks from their beach house, and leg it to small town Paradise, Ohio, where ""John"" immediately starts out at the local high school. But the Mogadorians are still in pursuit, not to mention a mysterious hot girl in leathers, not to mention ""John"" getting the hots for local high school photographer Sarah, not to mention becoming chums with local awkward kid ""Sam"" whose Dad was interested in aliens and disappeared, not to mention the high school jock whose dad is police chief and who still regards Sarah as his personal property, not to mention the dog which used to be a lizard and which has adopted ""John""...So we have a high school romance/rivalry/odd geek out sci-fi action adventure romp ie. significant genre crossover. Wwll, if Twilight can do it with vampires, there doesn't seem to be any reason why sci-fi shouldn't have a crack.I quite liked this. The characters are likable, there is always something happening, the action and effects sequences are well staged and, if you can put aside the negative elements, then you may well enjoy it. In fact, considering what a mess it is conceptually, it hangs together surprisingly well. It it has clearly been made with the hope that it will turn out to be the first entry in a franchise.But I have to point out two major criticisms. One, there are enough plot holes, illogicalities, and unanswered questions to stock a shop with, And, two, the main performers - Pettyfer in particular - are far too old to pass convincingly as high school students. If you look for other negatives, you'll find them - they aren't exactly difficult to uncover - but I found enough to like that I could ignore them or make up my own explanations.",I Am Number Four
14,anaconda-40658,Certainly Not Number 1.,2,12 May 2015,"I Am Number Four (2011): Dir: D.J. Caruso / Cast: Alex Pettyfer, Timothy Olyphant, Dianna Agron, Teresa Palmer, Kevin Durand: He is number four and goes by the name John Smith. That pretty much sums up the height of creativity in this side show embarrassment. For whatever reason these human looking beings with numerous powers are being hunted down by creatures that want them eliminated. Numbers one, two and three are already hunted down and killed. Now number four is on the run, enrolled in high school, falls for a female photographer, and beats up bully football players. This is all fairly routine and boring at best. D.J. Caruso does his best with the nonsense but this ranks about as bad as previous films he has directed such as Eagle Eye and Disturbia. Alex Pettyfer plays number four who has a few circular burn marks on his leg. That is supposedly rendering him different than other teen flick boy toys. Nonetheless the character is a joke particularly during bouts with his powers where he comes off as constipated. Timothy Olyphant plays a sort of relative protector who warns number four to remain out of sight. Dianna Agron is given the useless role of student female photographer who takes more photos than she should, and is plainly just a romantic prop. Teresa Palmer plays number six who figures in later, not that it really matters. It doesn't matter what number these idiots are marked with, the role is likely not going to be the lottery winning role of a lifetime. Special effects are the payoff while the film itself should be trampled upon by at least four elephants. Score: 2 / 10",I Am Number Four
15,Wuchakk,"""I am not a number; I'm a free man""",8,10 May 2020,"John is a very gifted teen (Alex Pettyfer) who keeps having to move from town to town with his guardian (Timothy Olyphant) because they're actually alien fugitives on the run from malevolent extraterrestrials called Mogs. They start over in southwestern Ohio and John insists on going to high school where he meets a special girl (Dianna Agron). Callan McAuliffe is on hand as a notorious geek at school while Teresa Palmer plays a mystery woman whose identity is revealed in the last act.""I Am Number Four"" (2011) was based on the book by Pittacus Lore (aka James Frey & Jobie Hughes). I never heard of the flick until stumbling upon it on streaming. It turns out that this was a fairly big production, costing $60 million and being produced by Michael Bay.Directed by D.J. Caruso, the film starts out too busy, like it's in a rush, not to mention there's zero subtlety about the nature of the protagonists and their extraterrestrial-oriented dilemma. But the flick soon finds its footing once the setting switches to Ohio and John goes to school. This, of course, brings to mind ""Twilight"" (2008), but ""I Am Number Four"" is way more ballsy. Yes, it's comic booky, but who cares? It delivers the goods as sci-fi drama/action.The creativity turned my head on a few occasions and when Teresa Palmer shows up in the final act, it's all the better. Then there's the cute dog with a revelation. Unfortunately, there was never a sequel even though the ending lays the groundwork. While the movie made $55 million domestically and $150 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment. The fools.The film runs 1 hour, 51 minutes, and was shot in southwestern Pennsylvania as follows: Monaca (Sam's house), Murrysville (high school), Beaver & Beaver Falls (the falls, etc.), McKeesport (house party & police car scenes), Vandergrift (street light explodes), Harmony (cemetery scene) and Pittsburgh. The opening was shot in Islamorada, Florida, with a scene or two done in Santa Clarita, California.GRADE: A-",I Am Number Four
16,gradyharp,A Downward Slide,5,14 June 2011,"I AM NUMBER FOUR starts out well enough: a handsome young lad going by the name of John Smith (Alex Pettyfer, 21 year old British actor) and his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant) have moved to a small Ohio town to avoid being found and killed by an alien group who seek to diminish John Smith's confreres in order (John is number four), having just killed number three whose son Sam (Callan McAuliffe, 16 year old Australian newcomer) happens to live in the little town. John meets a photographer girl Sarah (Dianna Agron) who has been dating pushy Mark (Jake Abel). Gradually John's alien powers emerge (his hands can be flashlights and he as extraordinary powers of physical strength), he puts his now competitor for in Sarah's affections Mark in place in fights, reveals his identity to Sam who bonds because of his father's being number three, and the trio - John, Sarah and Sam - are off and running. So far so good for a teenage love n' stuff movie. The problems (not only for the trio, but also for the audience) begin as the stalking aliens appear - hilariously ugly creatures with silly guns and manners of communicating - as well as a strange fighting girl (we discover later is the one designated number Six - Teresa Palmer). John, despite Henri's protective insistence that they move on, decides to stay because he has found love with Sarah. From this point the film just becomes silly as flying squirrels become immense, multifanged prehistoric monsters and the plot deteriorates into a mélange of gore, flying body parts, transmogrification of a pet dog into a beastie, etc etc etc. The film is squeezed out a novel 'Pittacus Lore' by James Frey and Jobie Hughes, molded into its present screenplay form by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Marti Noxon, and stirred by director D.J. Caruso. Before it becomes hilariously silly there are some pretty decent performances by Olyphant, Pettyfer and McAuliffe that make the film worth watching. It is a film that will please some (according to box office receipts it was quite successful) and lose others. Grady Harp",I Am Number Four
17,trashgang,I am number yawn,3,13 September 2011,"I have nothing against director D.J. Caruso, he made some good flicks like Taking Lives but what we have here was not my cup of tea. Face it, I watched it together with my wife and we both fell asleep. It reminded both of us a lot of Twilight, you know, the one who is in my top 5 worst films ever. This is definitely one for teenagers. It's all about who falls in love with who. The first minutes were okay and I thought, well, this is some kind of X-men but it wasn't. The story was okay but what they made of it wasn't science-fiction, as I said it's a love story. The acting was rather good but it also clocks in over 90 minutes which is too long. And the enemy wasn't convincing too. The effects were okay especially the animals who are attacking each other. But to end, if you are into Twilight or love stories and you are an adolescent in love for the first time then go figure it out, if you are a science-fiction buff leave it, I am number 4, naaaaaaah, just a number 3.",I Am Number Four
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: I Am Number Four,4,14 February 2011,"With the teenage fantasy film franchise about to face a dearth once Harry Potter finally goes one on one with Voldemort, and when the Twilight lovers get to live together as undead beings, something has to be done to fill the void. There were a number of pretenders, so many that even I'm lazy to name but a few recent efforts such as Percy Jackson or Cirque du Freak even. What's amazing with this production effort is that only one book has been released thus far, with one of two planned sequels hitting the shelves only in August this year. So how it all pans out in the novels by Jobie Hughes and James Frey is anyone's guess, but as a film, it contains all the trappings for its intended teenage target audience.And that means plenty of eye candy characters, out of this world powers, with buddy relationships and romantic ones forged. The film doesn't waste time jumping straight into where the action is in Kenya, where we witness the quick death of Number Three (Greg Townley) and his guardian, and we soon learn that their deaths have to follow a strict sequential order, so if you miss the deaths of Numbers One and Two, hit the trailer because it's there, and not contained in the film. No point regurgitating what's already done, right?I Am Number Four is just that, an introductory tale to a hopeful franchise to be blessed with some longevity. And with most origin films, this one spent considerable time in establishing the ground rules for discovery of powers, the relationships between characters, all primed for action sequences in between long drawn narratives building up toward that inevitable big bang conclusion which contained everything but the kitchen sink. all nicely choreographed with loads of CG enhancement in a bayhem manner that will make producer Michael Bay so proud with the decimation of a school and its sprawling football pitch.Simply put, it's like an extended version of Superman, but only for a race called the Loriens having sent nine of their offspring to Earth in order to escape total extermination by another alien race known as the Mogadorians. As they grow up incognito, they find out they have superhuman powers, yet have to be protected and lying in waiting for their true calling like sitting ducks. Being tracked and hunted down one by one by their space enemies is no fun, and Number Four (Alex Pettyfer), also known as John Smith, decide to hold some ground much to the disappointment of guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant, who was a Hit-man once so he knows what he's talking about), since it's not that hard to find him with his penchant of not knowing how to lie low, developing a hunger for earthly education and getting into the periodic scuffles in high school no thanks to attention showered on and being showered upon by his junior and budding photographer Sarah (Dianna Agron).It's then no surprise that with the parallels to Superman, the screenplay got written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who between them have clocked countless of Smallville episodes, joined by Marti Noxon in adapting the book for the screen, taking certain expected liberties when translating material from one medium to another. Somehow they didn't manage to keep the narrative tight in the beginning, deciding to sprawl it to introduce plenty of bit characters, though for important ones like the sidekick Sam (Callan McAuliffe), little time got devoted to telling his back story properly, as it was deemed more effective in trying to do so in a rather haphazard, impromptu manner.Like the Twilight films, this one had its fair share of moments in the beginning deeply entrenched into whipping up a boring romance, and to those who prefer the action as promised in the trailer, we'll be looking toward our watches to pass time. D.J. Caruso is certainly no stranger with stories that have teenage protagonists in the fight of their lives against something larger than they can imagine, with his most recent collaborations with Shia LeBeouf being case in point in Disturbia and Eagle Eye, and with strong alpha-female type characters to boot too supporting by the side, here with Teresa Palmer doing an about turn from her damsel in distress type of role in The Sorcerer's Apprentice, to being one ass- kicking alien in Number Six, obviously having reached her power puberty before Number Four.The villains don't really pose much of a threat besides looking and behaving mean, and it's a little bewildering why a race without powers and who uses space aged guns and winged creatures can defeat a race with magical guardians, maybe perhaps through sheer overpowering with numbers. I'm not about to read the book to find out though, nor was it explained about the very sticky sequential order that has to be stuck to. The special effects were top notch however, with the final act turning into a big Star Wars battle with blue and red lasers flying all over the place, and Number Six stealing the show with her more developed powers which include something ripped off from Nightcrawler in X-Men 2, and what I thought was the money shot together with Number Four as they fend off one final big bang. Truly impressive stuff there.Primed for a follow up film, whether it does get made is the question. I had expected a more compact origin told in one sitting to get it out of the way, but it soon became a slow plod bogged down by uninspired caricatures, with too much left out in the open, and generic gun totting villains who are obviously no match for the powers the heroes possess, making it pretty much a one sided fight.

It is not that it could have been more and wasn't; most of today's movies are like this. It is not that the acting wasn't good or that the production values were not OK. It is because they left the film with an open ending, hinting that something this average could turn into yet another adolescent hero series or even a TV show. That I could not stomach.Good parts: the dog, the special effects, Kevin Durand.Bad parts: the evil henchmen with flashy weapons that can't hit anything, the ridiculous super powers, the storyline, the amount of cardboard used.Very good parts: Teresa Palmer.Very bad parts: the high school sweetheart+bully drama.Bottom line: perfect movie for when you are tired and can't think enough to watch a decent film.",I Am Number Four
20,lasttimeisaw,I Am Number Four,5,5 June 2011,"I cannot take it too serious to this film because it was my wayward intention to watch some lightweight film just for a pop-corn revelry, so as it was the case, I should not be too whiny about it.To be honestly surprised, most of the time the film failed to stultify me, nevertheless, nothing spectacular either. The plot is tawdry with monsters, aliens, shapeshifter, of course corny human beings, which has bugged me since the beginning is the sequential alien-slaughter, which is rather inane and inexplicable (why bother? Right? They're aliens, who have their own reasons and principles which is beyond mankind's shallow imaginations). The attraction between No. 4 and his artsy love-interest is scant, especially Dianna Agron's sleepwalking existence severely aggravates the incompatible aura whenever the two strolls together, thankful but a tad late to the arrival of No. 6 (a delightful eye-candy Teresa Palmer) efficiently escalates the kick-ass index and rescues the film from the dormant mode, although both Alex Pettyfer, Callan McAuliffe and Palmer's sex appeal is unforgivably underused (I am counting Ms. Agron out under this condition and meanwhile testifying that myself is not a fervent Glee admirer either). Also my sincere sympathy toward Timothy Olyphant, his breakthrough has never ever arrived, even though he is better than most of his peers. Judging by its not so weighty budget, the film services well as a spring season, children- targeted entertainment, the tempo is fine and the high-light final skirmish is immaturely diverting. Through the young cast, it is easy to detect an explicit ambition to create a sci-fi version of Twilight Sega, but the box office feedback was disappointing, by now a sequel seems to be not so surefire.",I Am Number Four
21,KineticSeoul,Would have been a pretty crappy movie if wasn't for the final action scenes in near the end,4,26 February 2011,"Now I would have passed on seeing this in theater because of how crappy the premise and the trailer looked. I am not shocked the people that worked on ""Smallville"" made this movie because the trailer looked like a episode of a TV show with people with powers. For it being a 2 or 3 episodes on a TV show it would had been alright, but for a movie it fails on so many levels. It really isn't worth the time to kill in theater. It was basically like watching a dull teen drama except with teens that have powers and aliens. The vibe of this movie has ""Twilight"" all over it, even some of the scenarios has some stuff that is similar to ""Twilight"". And I wouldn't be shocked if that was the direction it was aiming for and for it's target audiences. This is basically a sci-fi teenage love story, but it's just boring and I almost fell asleep watching this. In fact this would have been a pretty crappy movie if it wasn't for the final action scenes in near the end. It's also similar like the ""Twilight"" movies are with it's cheesy and terrible dialogue.4/10",I Am Number Four
22,Hellmant,This film really is by the numbers!,5,20 April 2011,"'I AM NUMBER FOUR': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Hollywood's latest attempt at a long lasting youth appealing franchise. This one is once again based on a book (of the same name) written by James Frey and Jobie Hughes (going by the pseudonym Pittacus Lore). The film was adapted by Al Gough and Miles Millar (who also created the popular youth fantasy TV series 'SMALLVILLE') as well Marti Noxon (who was a writer on a series of the same genre 'BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER'). It was produced by Michael Bay and directed by D.J. Caruso (director of 'DISTURBIA' and 'EAGLE EYE'). The book is the first of an expected six book series all revolving around nine teenage aliens sent to Earth, with special powers, who are being hunted by other aliens and can only be killed in sequential order. The first revolves around 'number four'. It was released last August (2010) and has been fairly successful. The film was released last February (of this year) and has performed somewhat disappointingly (although foreign box-office has been decent) putting the future of the franchise in serious doubt. Given all that information I'd say the film delivered pretty much what I expected from it (although I expect more from Caruso). It's an average young adult sci-fi film, nothing more and nothing less.The film stars Alex Pettyfer as the fourth alien, of the group of nine, who was sent to Earth as a child (along with the others) and now lives with a guardian named Henri (Timothy Olyphant). The two travel from town to town taking on new names and new identities and always trying to avoid attention from the Mogadorians, the evil race of aliens trying to exterminate the chosen nine. As the film opens the 'number three' alien is killed and 'number four' senses it, which draws attention to himself. So he and Henri move to a new town where 'number four' takes on the name John Smith. In this town John makes friends with a picked on nerd named Sam (Callan McAuliffe) and a photographer named Sarah (Dianna Agron, of the TV series 'GLEE') who he develops feelings for. This makes it really hard for John to pick up things and skip town once again when the Mogadorians track him down. He does get help from 'number six' (Teresa Palmer) though who has been hunting down the Mogadorians instead of letting them hunt her down.The film of course is not very conclusive (it's the first of six). There's an action packed finale but nothing much is really resolved. The effects are decent at best and the action, other than the conclusion, is pretty scarce. Most of the film is filled with tired teenage melodrama and teen angst. Which would be fine if it was done well but it's not the least bit realistic or relatable (well maybe just a little). The acting is acceptable but just that. The film really has a tired generic and by the numbers feel to it (which is somewhat ironic I guess). It's really disappointing considering it comes from D.J. Caruso. I really enjoyed his 'DISTURBIA' and found 'EAGLE EYE' at least somewhat amusing. All in all the film is just OK. I guess it accomplishes what it set out to do but what it set out to do isn't very impressive.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7A8qHI10rk",I Am Number Four

After being forced to move again, they settle down in Ohio where Number Four falls in love with a pretty photographer.The actors were solid in their respective roles. Alex Pettyfer did good if not a little wooden as the main protagonist.

Overall, this a fun film that will most likely be enjoyed by sci-fi fans the most. I wish that more of the plot would have been explained in this movie.

29,atlasmb,A Teen-Targeted Sci-Fi Myth With Some Nice Action Scenes,7,15 May 2016,"A film targeted at young adults, ""I am Number Four"" starts with some compelling action, then settles into a typical teen high school story--with budding love, the school bully, and the kid who is picked on--with a twist of mystery. The main character, John (Alex Pettyfer), has to move to another town whenever he and his guardian become too visible. They are on the run. And their pursuers are killers from another planet. He tries to fit into the new school, but new kids are misfits and they draw attention, right? The plot has its awkward moments, but the action sequences, explosions, and firestorms are adequate distractions for those who want to suspend disbelief. And there are a few plot twists that keep things interesting, even if they are sometimes telegraphed to the audience ahead of time.Dianna Agron (""Glee"") is the object of John's affection, but romance is not the center of this film. Callan McAuliffe is effective in the role of Sam, the misfit who John takes under his wing.The film is tailor-made for a sequel, but it appears none is in the works at this time. ""Number Four"" feels, at times, like a video game, but it's a third person shooter and those don't appeal to everyone. Maybe that is why the box office was less than hoped for.",I Am Number Four
30,The-Sarkologist,Pretty decent film for a pulp novel,8,7 December 2012,"This is quite a strange movie and I could not determine whether it was a horror, a sci-fi, or a thriller. IMDb describes it as an Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller, though I would have to add elements of horror into this film. The horror elements is that the film is set in a small American town (though it is noticeable that main street has not yet been destroyed by Walmart) name Paradise (horror films always seem to be set in places with pleasant sounding names), the scene is generally dark and dreary, and the main characters are up against an mysterious force that is substantially more powerful than they are. Actually, a lot of films with the sci-fi moniker tend to actually be horror movies, and the only reason that they are sci-fi is because they involve aliens or futuristic scenes or technology. I am now thinking that sci-fi is not actually a genre in itself, but rather a thematic setting, since most sci-fi films will fall into action, horror, thriller, romance, and I will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself (though it is probably better classified as epic).This film is about a teenager (obviously so that it will appeal to a younger audience) who turns out to be from another planet. His planet was destroyed by a race known as the Mogadorians however he and a few others managed to escape from their planet and are hiding on Earth. The catch is that the Mogadorians have found their hiding place and have traveled to Earth to locate them. They have already killed three of them, and now they are after him.What we also learn of the hero (whose name is John Smith as he is trying to hide) is that he is of a special breed from his planet and as he grows older he develops extraordinary powers. We don't know if the powers are standardised or unique to each individual, though when we meet number six we suspect that it is the later. The other interesting aspect of this film is the nature of modern technology. While John Smith is attempting to hide and remain hidden, with the internet he is finding this very difficult. Further he has the urges of your average teenager to go to school and to socialise. However it is difficult to remain hidden in an American Highschool as if you are a jock, then you will be noticed, and if you shun the jock culture, then you attract attention to yourself.I guess another aspect of this film is about fitting in. In a way John wants to have a normal life, even if it involves not fitting in. We notice that he is the all American handsome hero, though he rejects that culture and befriends the school geek (and it turns out there is some connection between the school geek and his people) and the girl that has been turned into an outcast (and we also learn why she becomes an outcast). However, while at the beginning this film is about the new kid fitting in, it becomes clear that he goes from being the outcast (chased by the police as he is strange and different) to being the saviour. It should be remembered, even though it is not explicitly stated, that once the Mogadorians (whose appearance are quite monstrous in itself) have finished with their prey, they will turn onto the people of Earth, and without these protectors, they will not have a chance. Once again it shows that desire of the developed world to have a saviour that can stand up to the threats the we face on a daily basis. Unfortunately, unless one includes Jesus Christ in the fold (and Christ is not a superman in that sense of the word – he came and died so that we might be reconciled to the father, not to step up and defeat every evil force that comes our way, especially since evil in itself is quite subjective).",I Am Number Four

Caruso isn't one of my favorite directors, although I did enjoy Disturbia quite a bit, but that's probably his only film I actually liked. His latest film, I am Number Four, was actually a lot better than I expected. I really had very low hopes for this movie after watching the trailer, but I was surprised that it wasn't as terrible as I thought it would be. It was entertaining at some points and I enjoyed the performance from the young lead actors, but I was disappointed with the second half of the film that tried too hard to establish the franchise for the future instead of giving this movie a little more closure. I'm guessing that thanks to the open ending I am Number Four will end up incomplete along with the likes of Jumper and The Golden Compass since the film didn't do very well in the box office to be able to build a big enough fan base for the sequels. It's actually pretty sad because the beginning of the film looked very promising, but it suddenly became too big and ended up being messy. The film is based on the novel written by Jobie Hughes and James Frey, and the screenplay was adapted by Alfred Gough, Miles Milar, and Marti Noxon (the team that brought us several TV series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville, and the Spider Man 2 film). I'm not familiar with the novel so I can't say how faithful the screenplay is to the novel, but I can say that the screenplay isn't one of the strong points of the film.In I am Number Four Alex Pettyfer (who recently starred opposite Vanessa Hudgens in Beastly, but is better known for his lead role as Alex Rider in Stormbreaker) plays an alien who was only one of the nine survivors from his planet after a group of Mogadorians destroyed all life there. These nine children have escaped and are hiding on Earth among humans because they look like ordinary human beings despite having supernatural powers. Each child has a guardian who looks out for them. The movie begins with the murder of alien number three. Alex is number four; so he is next since the Mogadorians (led by the Commander played by Kevin Durand) have to kill them in numerical order for some reason (which is never explained). Number Four's cover has been blown, so his guardian, Henri (Timothy Olyphant: Hit-man, The Crazies) decides to give him a new identity as John Smith and move to a small town in Ohio called Paradise. Here, John decides to attend a local High School and continue his life as normal keeping a low profile while hiding from the Mogadorians who are looking for him. He tells everyone in school that he just moved in from New Mexico with his dad (Henri). He will have to adapt to the bullies in school, although he makes friends with a nerd named Sam (Callan McAuliffe) and falls in love with Sarah (Dianna Agron of Glee fame), another student who has a passion for photography. As the Mogadorians close in on John he is not willing on running away again since he is really in love with Sarah so he decides to stay in Paradise.Teresa Palmer (Sorcerer's Apprentice and Bedtime Stories) also has an important role in this film, although she appears more near the end and was probably supposed to be a co-lead character in the next films of the franchise. This Sci-Fi thriller begins very well setting up interesting characters, but halfway through the movie the plot becomes messy and the final fight scenes are far from memorable. The movie ends up being very cliché and follows the same formula almost every teen action film does these days. The plot is familiar (you have the bullies from school, the romantic triangle after the hot blonde who used to date jocks ends up being sweet and nice, the hero discovering his new found powers, the ¨I will love you forever¨ speech, and so on). I am Number Four is not a bad movie, it had me entertained for the most part, but it just misses the mark at the end by trying to be larger than it actually is. It won't be on one of my worst movies lists, but it is just an average film that I will have forgotten all about after a week. The most memorable thing about this movie for me will be the performances from Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron. Too bad the film didn't have a final resolution because I don't think they will be making a sequel after the poor box office results.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",I Am Number Four

He's masquerading as a typical teen and with the help of his (fairly useless) guardian has been on the run his entire life, trying to stay one step ahead of the intergalactic bounty hunters sent to kill his kind.

39,3xHCCH,Slow Exposition Yet Unsatisfying Story,5,8 March 2011,"I initially resisted to watch this film because of the bad reviews. However, curiosity and the expectation that this is the first film of a franchise prevailed, so I finally caved in and watched.Our hero is teenager John Smith. He is Number Four of the nine powerful aliens from a destroyed planet Lorien who have been transported to Earth. These nine are now being hunted one by one in order by their enemies, the Mogadorians. When Number Three was killed, John knows he will be next. He and his guardian Henri move to the quiet town of Paradise, Ohio. John is advised to keep a low profile, but of course with his striking looks and awesome skills, he simply could not help but stand out. He hooks up with Sarah, who just so happened to be the ex-girlfriend of the quarterback jock. He also conveniently makes friends with Sam, the school science nerd who claims his dad was abducted by aliens. As the Mogadorians close in on John, all hell breaks loose in Paradise. Any guesses who will win this fight?The bad reviews prepared me to moderate my expectations so I was not too disappointed. The whole thing was pretty predictable. The abilities of John have all been seen before in other alien or mutant films, like the X-Men. There were few stunts that have not yet been seen before. The CG of the alien monsters were not too good. As a whole, the film was just OK. It was directed to the teen crowd, as was the source book. Alex Pettyfer and Glee's Diana Agron both look good and play John and Sarah with chemistry. I guess since this is the first book of a series, maybe it is saddled with having to establish the premise and introduce characters, making it slow in exposition yet with an unsatisfying story. If the story of Number Five ever makes it to the big screen in the future, the audience would really expect the action factor to step up.",I Am Number Four
40,peterp-450-298716,A teen SF,5,23 March 2014,"""Grease in space"" I started watching this without any prior knowledge. Ultimately, it is not that special, but also not that terribly bad. It's obvious the makers played it safe. It's ultimately a mix of a high-school teen movie and a softcore SF. The high school section contains all the cliché ingredients: the jock (quarterback, of course), a cheerleader, a nerd who's constantly harassed by the hunks of the school, the newcomer John who's not bad looking but is seen as if he's an alien (what a coincidence). Off course John will defend the nerd and is immediately attracted to the cheerleader at first glance (melt, sigh, swoon ...). How obvious. You can feel a romantic love relationship coming up. So the main and largest target group, the giggling teenage girls, is satisfied now.And now we have to add something so the boyfriends are satisfied enough to accompany those teen girls to the cinema. John is one of the survivors (No.4 of course out of 9) from the planet Lorien who were exterminated by the Mogadorians. These Mogadorians are almost a copy of the Sith's from ""Star Wars"". They are chasing these Lorianen (Loriethers, Loriers ...??) to exterminate them. The reason why is unexplained. Of course there was in the infinite universe only one planet where they could hide : Earth. And on earth starts a battle between those two alien races.Apparently this movie is an interpretation of a book. For me a decent adaptation is one you still can understand despite you haven't read the book and eventually you know what it is about. However, this adaptation leaves many unanswered questions: what is that damn box, why should they be eliminated in that order, what is the meaning of the necklaces...There are also positive things to enumerate. John Smith plays a decent rendition. Sarah is a beautiful appearance and Nr. 6 looks so delicious I could eat her. The Mogadorians are tremendously funny sometimes and the film also contains other funny dialogues: Sheriff James: Who the hell are they? Mark James: Big-ass linebackers? The ending of the movie was fairly successful done in terms of effects and action. Even the swollen dog that had to fight against the bat-like hell hound in the showers, was quite enjoyable.Conclusion: A simple teenager feel-good movie with a portion SF action.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",I Am Number Four
41,Sherazade,Smallville + Supernatural + Dark Angel + Buffy = I am 4,7,31 July 2011,"Yes it's everything you've seen before and on the small screen for that matter but don't think for a second that you wouldn't be entertained or have your socks knocked off by I am Four.

Teresa Palmer (#6) steals the show and was horribly underused in this (I hope there's a sequel in the works) but Alex Pettyfer (#4) holds his own too. For the life of me, no matter what I've seen him in, I can't stop seeing him as the high school bully he played in a British film I saw years ago so to actually see him play the bullied in this film finally got my mind off of it for it bit. As for those wondering why my summary is entitled: 'Smallville' + 'Supernatural' + 'Dark Angel' + 'Buffy' = 'I am 4', I came to this conclusion based on a lot of elements in the film like the theme of the boy from another planet hiding out on earth and trying to fit in a la Clark Kent from TV's 'Smallville' or the abandoned boy who keeps searching for his father who vanished chasing after supernatural entities a la Sam and Dean from TV's 'Supernatural' and the whole element of the watchers a la TV's 'Buffy the vampire slayer' as well as the element of superhuman young adults trying to figure out their abilities, watching out for one another while evading military capture a la Maxx and the gang from TV's 'Dark Angel' all themes you can look forward to in this film thanks to the writing team of Gough and Millar.",I Am Number Four
42,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,I Am Number Four (2011),8,8 March 2012,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. In this day and age, everything is trying to be the new teen driving force of fantasy fiction. Usually focusing on an outsider that belongs to a bizarre otherworldly group. We've done wizards, vampires, and now we have aliens. I Am Number Four sees Alex Pettyfer star as a boy that must run from location to location, along with his guardian Henri. They are being hunted as they are part of an alien race wiped out on their home planet by the Mogadorian. There are 9 special kids with different powers. 3 have already been killed. Pettyfer has all the key ingredients to be a leading man. He has looks and charm, and is able to carry enough emotion when he needs to. I Am Number Four is nothing new at all, but it does do everything well. Perhaps I was in the mood for something simple. You get your clichéd high school characters, and their usual relationships. Pettyer falls fro the ex of the high school hero jock etc. Makes friends with the creepy conspiracy kid and so on. But I liked all these characters. The action was fantastic and I felt really involved. Gun battles, exciting foot chases, martial arts, and all of it filmed so you can tell precisely what is going on. It's one of those films that was exactly what I wanted at the time. I will certainly be reading the books after this.",I Am Number Four

The Plot - Nothing in this movie makes sense if you haven't read the book. This movie is missing many major plot points. Characters make dumb decisions and run around acting like idiots. Nothing is explained. Acting - The acting is terrible and cringy.The Effects - This is just a cheap movie and all the visuals are laughably bad. This is a poorly made, forgettable movie that does not serve the books justice. Its not worth watching or talking about.

Most teen movies manage some semblance of sensibility and attention to detail. No.4 did not. To say the dialogue is cheesy and lame would be like saying hydrochloric acid stings a bit! in other words, a gross understatement.Right from the start we learn the bad guys are called ""Mogadorians"". I mean, really? They couldn't come up with anything better than that. It's like the name a seven year old would come up with. Next up is the intro narration ""I am an alien from another planet...."" There are priceless awful gems of dialogue scattered throughout the film, my favourite being ""Gossip spreads like Ebola."" I only wish I was kidding about this stuff.Its awful.I think the biggest failing is that the film doesn't know what it wants to be. It has the cheesy lines of a comedy action flick, the teen angst and highschool hijinks of a coming of age movie and here and there the most pitiful attempts at trying to scare the audience.About that last.... The Mogadorians, apart from their childish name, have all the menace of scifi convention cosplayers. I was literally sniggering every time they were on screen. Meanwhile, in the background, sinister music was playing.As I say, the movie was entertaining but for the wrong reasons. But hey, I suppose it was entertaining.

45,eric262003,Compared To Twilight? Really Now!,9,13 August 2012,"After reading many numerous unjustified rants on IMDb.com, many have foolishly compared ""I am Number Four"" to ""Twilight"". I guess the leading demographics that have seen this movie have never in their life seen ""Twilight"" and are just hasty to assume it's in comparison to ""Twilight"" because it has young people and romance, but that could easily be compared with other teen movies or chick flicks before and after ""Twilight"". ""I Am Number Four"" is filled with plenty of exciting stuff that will hold your interest, and refrains from being a sentimental emo fest. The movie centres around the emphasis on survival rather than an over-baked romantic story with a little padded adventure to the plot. It's more about the adventure being top priority and the romance as secondary rather than vice versa like ""Twilight"". In fact it sets out to do everything that ""Twilight"" didn't do and succeeds so that it isn't copious to the ""Twilight"" franchise.""I Am Number Four"" tells the story about an adolescent from another planet who's about to observe his new powers. He is part of a group of talented gifted aliens who's mission was to protect their now annihilated planet. Number Three was killed by a rival band of aliens who demolished their plant. Number Four and his mentor land in the small town of Paradise, Ohio. Number Four now goes by the the alias, John Smith (how original) get in on the action as he enrols in his new high school. One day he spotted some football jocks bullying an awkward science aficionado named Sam (who thinks his father was kidnapped by extraterrestrials), and is smitten by the football players ex-girlfriend, Sarah. While taking down bullies from picking on weaker students, the aliens are almost setting their course for Earth. When John's mentor is MIA, John and Sam start searching for him. The film ends with a dynamic showdown which includes a confrontation with reptilian like monsters.Sure the content has been done millions of time before, but the execution of story was well seasoned and very provocative. The performances were not Oscar calibre, but it was truly played by heart and the actors did what could out of their script, including the bulling football jocks. Sure it won't sit for everyone's tastes, being that it's another teen movie with the romantic subplot in tact with the script. And I originally had low expectations when seeing the movie at first.

Where have we seen this before? Does the word Vampire ring a bell with you?If the director concentrated more on the actors he had and not so much on the CGI, we might have had a better movie. Until that day comes, we will continue to see actors who say their lines as though they are in a dream-state. They don't project their lines. It's like the lines are said and come right back into their mouths. It's almost like the dialogue was dubbed and the actors just mouthed the words. Not much passion there. Did we care about anyone? I didn't. Will you?The opening scenes to this movie set the tone for confusion. Everything was in the dark and this lasted for more than a few minutes; no one knew what was going on; no one knew who was doing what to whom. We just knew there were struggles because we could hear that in the dark, but who was struggling? Guess we will never know. Oh, wait a minute, it was Daniel and later John Smith, but he didn't know he had any powers yet. Darn. Always the last to know. Henri (Olyphant), his guardian, hadn't told him everything. Darn.. Now, Daniel and later John Smith is about 18-years old. When would Henri tell Daniel and later John Smith what he needs to know about his powers? When he's 30? You have to understand that Henri and Number Four (Daniel and later John Smith) had to move around a lot because the aliens kept finding them and that is the reason for the different names. Oh, and just so we are clear: Numbers One, Two and Three had already been killed. The aliens are now after Number Four. The aliens had a certain structure to their make-up. The teen romance between John Smith and Sarah (Agron) was lame to say the least. Awkward doesn't do it justice. The only bright spot in this was Timothy Olyphant. You knew what you were getting with his character and he was the only one that had any sense of urgency about him, along with Number Six (Palmer) who had enough passion for all of them put together. But, let's not forget the alien bad guys. They were terrific whoever they were. However, the CGI was again terrific. I was even ducking away from those monsters the aliens had locked up for a time and were set loose. Yikes !The movie left it open for a sequel. Oh, hum, here we go again. I need to stop yawning.

The movie is not boring and the pretty faces & cool action keeps you engaging but when you think about what's happening and why? Then your head hurts. Not all of us have read the books; the director and writers should have kept this thing in mind. Alex Pettyfer is a good looking guy but lacks some series acting chops, he is good in parts but sometime I felt he was totally blank. Dianna Agron is pretty but boring. She was trying so hard to be soft and sweet that it made me uncomfortable, it wasn't real. It's just like Quinn (Glee) on Charity mode. Teresa Palmer was a badass and did some amazing stunts. Loved it. Callan McAuliffe is OK, he was far better in Flipped. With ambiguous story & mediocre villains, this movie is forgettable.

She doesn't have any lines in the first two-thirds of the film; in her only previous appearance, the camera frames her as she strides away from an explosion whilst a rock song blares from the soundtrack... This appears to be a mindless aesthetic decision, until later on she opens her mouth and you suddenly realise why they made the right choice in having her say as little as possible. At the apex of the film, her character's only real function is to wrap her gums around a few quips; alas, she even manages to ruin those by demonstrating her complete tin ear for the rhythm of dialogue. Her line readings were horrifically inept.The film as a whole was OK though, if you don't immediately object to the concept of 'Twilight with aliens in it, instead of vampires'.",I Am Number Four
50,MrGKB,"Despite my rating, I somehow enjoyed this one...",5,8 December 2011,"...and perhaps it was just a reflection of my expectations, which were fairly low thanks to the critical disdain the film earned when released, its (relatively) poor performance at the box office, and its lukewarm rating here on the IMDb. Fortunately, all I invested in it was a few hours of time, and despite its myriad faults, I had a good enough time to not feel cheated.As even the dullest of wags on this site have noted, the story is formulaic and the characters verge toward stereotypical, but the truth of the matter is that the piece is well crafted (Syd Field would approve), and it looks great, no small thanks to a host of specials effects companies and the usual fine makeup work of KNB EFX, fine camera-wrangling by Guillermo ""Pan's Labyrinth"" Navarro, decent acting from a host of up-and-comers (ignore the naysayers on this site, who undoubtedly couldn't act their way out of a paper bag), a serviceable score from Trevor ""Yes"" Rabin, and workmanlike, though unspectacular, direction from D.J. ""Disturbia"" Caruso.If anything, the greatest fault of ""I Am Number Four"" is most likely the Disney-fication of the source material (which, admittedly, I have not read). All the actors are highly photogenic, everything takes place in a storybook town, the action (despite its violent nature) is pretty sanitized, even for a PG-13 affair, and the dialogue pretty much is, too. There really are no surprises, not counting the abrupt appearance of a character obviously intended to be a full lead in the inevitable sequel, and even that's telegraphed. Yet--somehow--it held my interest, and left me actually looking forward to that inevitable sequel.

53,johnstonjames,um. really. How Weird.,7,26 July 2011,"i dunno. as time passes and things get more relaxed and allowed more freedom, things do start to get a little weird. people do and say often whatever comes to mind. and it's just that. a whole lot of whatever.this movie struck me as a little weird for some reason. can't quite put my finger to it, because i see a lot of weird movies. i like weird movies. so i couldn't quite figure out why this one felt that way to me. maybe it is because usually in the past, when i was growing up, this whole ""I was a Teen-Age..."" something or other, were usually low budget, off the wall, concoctions by small, independent distributors. we pretty much expected them to be really ""out"" there. i guess when a major production company like Dreamworks releases it, the whole ""I was a Teen-age..."" concept seems sort of grandiose and over-blown that you feel prompted to take it more seriously.it was a little hard to contemplate things too seriously in this film because it was made up of so much conventional sci-fi blather and weirdness that it gives you a after viewing hangover. especially the battle at the end between the forces of good vs bad where it's a spectacular show of lights and explosions at the local school. rather than suspenseful the whole thing comes off as sort of mind numbingly crazy and frantic.the acting was without a doubt the worst thing here. boy oh boy were these young actors blocks of wood. i can't remember a single teen movie where the acting was so sterile and cold. i've seen the horrible coldness of the acting briefly in those dreadful 'Twilight' films, but i didn't think anyone would try to emulate it or turn it into a style. acting cold and detached and aloof isn't necessarily what it's all about. breathe some life into your performances for christsakes.i don't know if i related to too much of this nonsense. the popular jocks of the school were portrayed as evil, narcissistic jerks, and that seemed as real enough a description of things to me, but the lead characters were so wooden and lifeless i found it a little hard to care about their business either.oh well. kids might like it. kids seem to like a lot of mindless trashola these days. kids seem even more mindless than my baby boomer generation. and my generation could be pretty mindless that's fer sure. i doubt this film is any worse than the kiddie 'Twilight' series or the babyishness of the 'Transformer' movies. this film is more than likely a little better than that mind-numbing crud, but still, not enough real substance for me here. unless kids do a real turn around (which i seriously doubt, but hey, they're only kids) i'm sure we are going to have to listen to future generations of mindless blather that is just as bad, or even worse, than what the current baby boomer generation blathers out.",I Am Number Four
54,Superunknovvn,Twilight with balls,6,21 March 2011,"Do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you're going to enjoy a film or not within the first ten minutes? Well, it wasn't true this time, because after the opening sequence, I was pretty sure I was going to hate ""I Am Number Four"". Thankfully, I was in for a pleasant surprise.It all starts with bad CGI-monsters and some guys in Star Trek make-up chasing people around in the jungle. We then cut to some jocks doing tricks on jet skis and some bland blonde girls admiring them - and I thought this is going to be terrible. Then the story picks up and the movie gets better from there.The story involves a couple of characters and mysteries, but is never too complicated. After the initial jet ski scene, the main character actually turns out to be played quite charmingly by Alex Pettyfer. He's supported by his mentor/protector (solid as always: Timothy Olyphant). Glee's Dianna Agron plays Number Four's love interest. She comes across very natural, so that the love story that unfolds is actually engaging instead of vomit-inducing like that of that other movie with the whining Vampires and the shirtless Werewolves.Of course, ""I Am Number Four"" is by no means a great movie. The CGI sucks in places and the make-up of the bad guys is just awful. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of a popcorn movie.However, I think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect a masterpiece, considering the movie's premise. For what it is, ""I Am Number Four"" is an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenagers and undemanding twenty-somethings. Add to that the fact that this movie is neither a sequel nor a remake, that it's not based on a comic book, a TV series, a computer game or toys, and it's enough to lift ""I Am Number Four"" heads and shoulders above its genre competitors.",I Am Number Four
55,JohnRayPeterson,"Sci-Fi made for girl teens, perhaps?",6,13 May 2011,"The principal actor, is suppose to be of high-school age; this starting point was not going over well for me, never mind that it's a sci-fi. Alex Pettyfer who plays John, our hero here, looks like a younger Bruce Payne but Bruce Payne he is not; the resemblance is striking however. I don't think anyone will buy that he's a teenager. He has developing superpowers, hard ones to define or explain and thank god no one tried. We're to believe these superpowers are due to him being a special alien; again not sure why he's a special alien. Bad guy aliens pursue him for reasons that were and still remain obscure to me. Those bad guys are kind of wuss, they look it, and were it not for their super duper weapons of sure destructions, they are laughable. The bad guys haul killer pets around in flimsy trailers; the pets are your horror movie monsters from another movie.Sorry I have to stop here or else I'll have to use curse words, to properly describe the rest. For some demented reason I watched it till the end, waiting for the comedy bit to start; it never did.

The producers ought to be proud they can excite horny teenage girls, most guys would.",I Am Number Four
56,DonFishies,Not so much a disappointment as it is deeply unsatisfying,4,25 February 2011,"In a perfect world, the convoluted mess called I Am Number Four could have been great. It had all the trappings for success: based off a semi-popular novel for teens, a fairly accomplished director in D.J. Caruso, the producing ""talent"" of Michael Bay, two hot young stars in Alex Pettyfer and Glee's own Dianna Agron, and an enigmatic, yet intriguing trailer campaign. So why is it that the final product is one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experiences I have had in some time? Opening with the death of ""Number Three"", we jump into the life of John (Pettyfer), an alien being protected on Earth from a group called the Mogadorians. As it turns out, the Mogadorians wiped out the population of John's planet years before, except for nine children with extraordinary powers. For some reason, they have to be killed in order, and with three down, John is next in line for extermination. As he goes on the run with his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant), they settle into the small town of Paradise, Ohio. Soon after, John starts gaining and learning more about his powers. But with a new love (Agron) and his lust to just be normal thrown into the mix, John may be in more trouble than he can imagine.I have never read the source material for I Am Number Four, but I would hazard a guess that it did a half decent job of explaining what is going on, and did not just strive to set future sequels in motion. The film on the other hand, suffers because the sequel seems to be the only thing in mind outside of special effects. We are thrown right into John's life, and we only get little nuggets of reason for what is going on at any given time. We never get full explanations, and are never even offered the ability to piece it together by ourselves. The film seems merely content giving us hints, offering little enigmatic moments to get us thinking. But instead of doing anything with these scenes, it merely continues trucking along to its eventual ending which promises a continuation and the hope for some further reasoning for what is happening. But if the filmmakers do not care about informing the audience now, why will we care later? But this would not be such a slap in the face if we had not already seen so many films in the past half-decade doing the exact same thing, attempting to replicate the success of the Harry Potter, Twilight and The Lord of the Rings franchises. The Golden Compass, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, The Spiderwick Chronicles, and Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief (which this film oddly resembles) are all examples of studios making films out of young adult books, specifically to capitalize on the potential for sequels and lengthy franchise possibilities. They all failed in varying degrees, because they all suffer from the same thing I Am Number Four suffers from – not enough plot, too much dependence on a sequel. Had all of these films even attempted to be able to stand on their own, perhaps they would have gotten the sequel they seemed to think they deserved. I know Four is part of a proposed book franchise, as opposed to an already established book franchise, but it merely skipped the waiting in the middle for the eventual film.Should these plot and sequel problems not already be enough, Four suffers from copying Twilight a little too close (even including the notable musical cues from current alt-rockers). Sure, there are no vampires, but the romance between John and Agron's Sarah feels a little too forced for comfort. Right in the middle of being hunted down to be systematically wiped out, we are supposed to believe that someone who has spent their life running, would simply fall in love out of the blue, and not feel any consequences? We are supposed to believe he does not know better? Sure he's a teenager and we all did stupid things when we were that young, but why does the focus of the film seem to hinge on the chemistry and romance between these two star-crossed lovers? I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion, and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story, and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci-fi is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst. It is awkward, silly, and practically plagiarizes Twilight.I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story, but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop. The film criminally underuses Olyphant, the only actor who actually acts in the entire film, and makes him into an almost useless background character. We only get glimpses of Teresa Palmer's character throughout the film (the trailer already gives away any mystery of who she might be), and when she finally shows up to do something, she merely speaks in overtly sexual allusions. Pettyfer and Agron both seem to suffer from not knowing what emphasis to put on their character and when, and relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe is stuck in the cliché-ridden role as the know-it-all geek of a best friend.When it attempts to work, I Am Number Four is quite interesting. I would have loved more story, and a whole lot less romance. Even what does work (including the decent special effects) seems to suffer as a result of all the melodramatic romance.4/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",I Am Number Four
57,the-movie-guy,Your typical teenage with special powers,4,22 February 2011,"John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) and his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant) escaped to earth from the planet Lorien. For years they have been trying to stay off the grid, because the Mogadorian hunters are searching to annihilate the last of his people. They must continually move from town to town and change their identities to stay one step ahead of these skillful and vicious killers. Three of his kind have already been killed, and he is their next target. As a teenager, John is just now receiving his special powers that he can use to protect himself from his enemies.From what I knew about the story and from the trailers, the movie was a big letdown. Even though this movie targets teenagers, the story itself flows all over the place. You have your typical teenager being the new kid in school, meeting a pretty girl, and getting picked on by school bullies. The only difference is that John is from another planet with amazing powers and being hunted. The movie started off with an action scene that grabs you and gets you interested in the story; however, for the next hour the movie will almost put you to sleep. The dialogue was dreadful and the performances were awful. It got to a point that I didn't care if the Mogadorians killed all nine of the Loriens that came to earth, because the movie would then be over. By the end of the movie, you finally get to see the special effects that you have been waiting for. The action and fighting is pretty good, but it is over before you know it.

This guardian also protects him from who is tracking them - and that's a good thing because apparently those trackers are not the most friendly and want the guy killed. If this weren't bad enough the guy is coping with being a teenager and the fact that he is growing to have super-powers.When I saw the trailers for this film I was thinking ""popcorn amusement with action sequences and nothing more than that"". Nothing wrong with that sometimes so maybe it was worth a watch. When the film started to play though it became clear very quickly that this wasn't entirely what the film wanted to be.Instead it is a combination of teenager peer-pressure drama, young love, impossible choices and melodrama. It's not quite as bad as Twilight in these, but it's still pretty bad. Tossing all these effects into a film that lives on action sequences though makes for a very chaotic and messy end result. It flops from left to right and leaves its audience confused and bored in the middle.If there's one advice to give to the makers of this film it is: ""pick a theme and stick to it"".

I also liked the geeky boy Sam and it was good that the movie overall didn't take itself so seriously. The reason that it's only so so is that the story was just not very compelling.

While I wouldn't call it the former or the last one, it definitely has shades of ""Smallville"", although that one is done better.While Alex Pettyfer makes for a good lead for his type of character (as well as looking good for the ladies obviously), and he has some good chemistry with co-star Dianna Agron of ""Glee"" fame, Teresa Palmer's presence feels tacked-on as if to counter Pettyfer's sex appeal by appealing to the opposite sex. Tim Olyphant does nothing much other than to snark. Kevin Durand, under some good make-up, looks like he's enjoying himself as the main villain here, but Callan McAuliffe does a surprisingly good job as the sidekick who rarely in movies like these, DOESN'T makes an ass of himself AND becomes a sympathetic character too.The film is technically well made, of course being a major studio picture. Trevor Rabin gives a pounding score, full of action and then quiets down for the ""romantic"" moments. Gulliermo Navarro frames the film nicely without the camera being too shaky. The production design/value is not bad, but could've been better, and the editing is nicely paced, which makes the film not rushed. This movie can be seen as pure entertainment by the mainstream crowd.My major complaint is that this kind of plot-lines is super cheesy and running out of steam, in my honest opinion. Teens deserve better kind of movies that will blow them away, not this fluff. Yes, there's the sci-fi elements, there's the interesting characters, but they are used in a ham-fisted way by the screenwriters. Director D.J. Caruso and producer Michael Bay are to blame. Caruso directs the film competently but shows no room for improvement and doesn't try to be anything more, and Bay, being the adrenaline junkie he is, feels like adding at least one gratuitous explosion as if to say ""I made this! This is my trademark!"". He eventually does though. The action sequences are wild, particularly during the climax of the film where the stunt crew, I mean the special effects team, basically go bonkers with the action, but in some parts in is intense. And guess what folks? The ending hints at a sequel! Oh joySo this well-made but extremely shallow film is bogged down even more by an extremely UN-original screenplay and heartless direction, and that's sad. This movie would've been a big hit during the early naughties but right now it's just plain cheesy and unoriginal. But at least this movie doesn't try to be anything else, as the results can be disastrous. You can watch a better movie than this, however as a date movie, it could be alright, I guess. Kids, teens or anyone not used to too many movies may like or even love this but I personally found this a boring, unoriginal and uninteresting giant cliché of a movie. If this is the future of Hollywood then I'm worried.Overall rating: 40/100 (FOUR/10, pun intended)P.S. This movie would make a great iPhone advertisement. Just look at how many times the phone shows up on screen!",I Am Number Four
63,TheMarwood,Another franchise non-starter,4,22 July 2014,"This failed attempt at spawning a franchise based off a series of young adult books, feels like an incomplete film. Sure, there's a laser fight climax, but the film is so back story heavy and throws so much exposition about these alien antics that the story is so much larger than the tiny serving of narrative that we are given. The film trades in it's developing mythology to focus a good portion of the running time on a formulaic high school romance, complete with jealous ex's. The bar for I Am Number Four was not set high when the Twilight series and it's structure and success was the benchmark to reach. Director for hire D.J Caruso, is far more talented than this trite teen cheese and perhaps the allure of being put in charge of what was to be the next big franchise was what signed him to this. The mediocre box office receipts and horrid critical reception must have been a sobering disappointment, as he's delivered a featherweight film that doesn't stand on its own and will never materialize into a series.",I Am Number Four
64,Meven_Stoffat,Twilight + Plot of Johnny Mnemonic + Cast of Twilight + Good special effects + SLIGHTLY better acting than Twilight= I Am Number Four,1,16 February 2011,"I saw an advance screening of the flick tonight. The only reason I went and saw it was because my buddy had a free screening pass for 2, and it's a free screening. I remember reading the book and not being very impressed, however I can't say I can pinpoint exactly what's been left out since I had forgotten most of it. Not sure if I even care now that I've seen both ends of the spectrum.Caruso tries a lot to hide the book's flaws, and he really does try hard. But somehow he only makes them more obvious. I'll admit there was tonnes of action and good special effects, but really, when the story wasn't stealing from other sci-fi (Animorphs, Johnny Mnemonic, Superman- there's even an insulting John Carpenter's The Thing nod too), it was overloading the audience's brain with Clichés that can be found in almost any teen movie... ever. And some gigantic plot holes you could drive a tanker through.The action scenes I nearly left the cinema they were so bad. It's like Caruso told the camera crew to zoom in really close while holding the camera and shake it all about, shine flashlights in the camera lens, and move it violently when some gets punched. Shaky Camera and quick cutting must die, I'm tired of it.The soundtrack was so bombastic and over the top. At times it sounds like the boom mic is being banged against the inside of a 50 gallon drum. At others it's like they're attacking their strings as fast as they can really fast. The film's opening score piece over the panning shot is especially insulting- it doesn't help that it lasts a minute long and the cue's buildup is hilarious.I know the movie is based on a book, but with even that said, there is a tonne of clichés. Hot chick who loves photography? Check. New kid is instantly buds with the nerd? Check. Douchebag jock who loves the hot chick? Check. Kid finds out he has powers he can't control? Check. evil villain are following kid and guardian? Check. Kid's guardian dies and he must do the mission without him? Check.There's also an annoying homo-erotic undercurrent between Sam and ""John"". Also, don't get me started on the Thirty-Sue pileup that is Number 6.For every cliché, there's a gigantic plot hole. Why isn't the grocery clerk suspicious of an alien with a hoodie and sunglasses buying a crap load of turkeys? How is ""John"" unable to control his powers in class yet able to control them perfectly in his backyard a matter of hours later? Why do the Mogadorian(!!!!) speak with Jamaican accents? How is the dog able to become all super-dog all of a sudden? Why are Lorien so perfectly humanoid with a true lack of alien qualities? And how do Lorien copulate? Yeah, let's not go there, because the last thing this film needs is a Lorien sex scene.",I Am Number Four
65,Maleplatypus,Made for showing in airplanes and buses,4,20 August 2011,"Although someone invested a lot of money in this film, I believe that there should be some rating that says: ""Not recommended for adults."" However, everybody will watch it when ""forced"" to do so (in public transportation mentioned in the summary). For starters, I thought that this is a full feature mixed commercial for several brands that are inevitable in most scenes. They just poke your eyes. Acting is quite OK (Olyphant is as good as always, and still highly underestimated), technical aspect correct (not more than that) but the story is packed with holes like a Swiss cheese. I didn't read the book (which I usually do when the movie is an ""adaptation""), but I strongly believe that there is more to the story in it than in this film. It just couldn't be less. When you watch this movie, remember to switch off all your brain's higher functions. There could be a sequel. Be scared of it. However, once there was once an excellent movie with the same basic idea (The Hidden, 1987, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093185/) and this I recommend with all my heart.

They are downplayed by smart asses that I doubt even watched the film or if they did, these 'reviewers' have no imagination, depth or creativity LOL. I am sure it is the same 'reviewers' who panned another lovely action and adventure film set in an alternate Universe, The Mortal Instruments. I loved every character in this film and the connection between them though understated, was real and emotional at the right level for the genre. Each young actor was charismatic with our young Australians Teresa Palmer and Callan McAuliffe doing us proud.Just like good Hallmark Romances that though the themes repeat, each has its own individuality and spark, this film offers a lot to those seeking to forget their own reality for a while and fly away into a world where good always seeks to overcome evil and succeeds despite the odds. We all regularly need that kind of uplift.",I Am Number Four
67,TheMovieMark,Smallville + a bigger budget + Twilight = I Am Number Four,5,18 February 2011,"Based on the NY Times best-selling novel by ""Pittacus Lore"" (an alias for the memoir-fabricating James Frey and Jobie Hughes), I Am Four kicks off the cinematic proceedings with an intense and creepy jungle chase scene and an intriguing - albeit fairly unoriginal - concept.The planet Lorien (COUGH krypton COUGH) was destroyed, and nine of its alien children were sent to earth. Why earth? Who knows. Perhaps earth's atmosphere is the most similar to Lorien's? A race of 7-foot tall humanoids called the Mogadorians are hunting down the children one at a time. Why? Beats me. Because we wouldn't have a story otherwise, I suppose. All we're really told is ""they're a race who chooses to decimate rather than colonize."" So be it.Anyway, due to some sort of spell the Mogadorians are forced to kill the nine remaining Lorien kids in the proper order. Who established the order and how? No idea. Wouldn't you be pretty ticked off if you were Number One and became aware that you were chosen to be killed first? Perhaps the numbering system is completely random. Otherwise, that's a pretty jacked up system. ""Hmm, little Billy seems to be a little slow upstairs, and that lisp sure ain't doin' him any favors. Let's make him Number One."" Regardless, numbers one to three are now dead, so the story focuses on Number Four.Number Four's desperate attempts to fit in lead to yet another blown cover, and he and his guardian Henri must once again relocate - this time to the small town of Paradise, OH. Following the film's somewhat promising start, the story takes an ill-advised detour and bogs down in a teenage romance marsh. It's at this point that Number Four (AKA John Smith) falls in love, defends a nerd against bullies, and begins to discover his unique abilities (known as legacies).This blatant drawing from the well of the Twilight series' formula might giddy up the hearts of teenage girls, but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film's trailer promised.That arrival comes in the film's third act in the form of a deus ex machina known as Number Six (Teresa Palmer) who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rumpage against the backdrop of CGI and special-effects. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences, but the drive there should've been smoother and more evenly-paced.Dialogue is weak, character development is practically non-existent, and the underdeveloped backstory creates too many questions that lead to frustration rather than intrigue. Granted, this is an origin story that's specifically designed to kick-start a franchise, but a little more self-containment would have been appreciated.One of the film's biggest transgressions is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. We're told that he's a Lorien warrior, and as such you'd expect him to join in the butt-kickery. Unfortunately, he's only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped (done off-screen to mask its implausibility) by a couple of out-of-shape alien conspiracy theorists. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior/guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom.The film presents a seed or two of hope that the franchise can improve with each installment, but will its identity crisis allow it to do so? Attempting to be all things to all teenagers could backfire if it fails to create loyalty amongst any one demographic.Teenage audiences and those who don't consume themselves with the story's many flaws will be more forgiving than I. Perhaps your expectations will be exceeded, but there's a good chance you'll be either underwhelmed or disappointed. Wouldn't you rather risk a dollar at Redbox than $10 a pop at the theater? Don't say I didn't properly inform you.",I Am Number Four
68,RichardSRussell-1,Starring Troy Donahue As Frankenstein's Monster,7,18 February 2011,"I Am Number 4 (1:47, PG-13, Imax) — fantasy: comics & pulps, 3rd string, originalAlex Pettyfer has the makings of this generation's Troy Donahue* — young, good-looking, tan, square-jawed, with a surfer-boy bleached mop of hair. But I wouldn't put much money down on Dianna Agron being the new Connie Stevens, because she's winsome, girl-next-doory, and, um, roundish, lacking Stevens's edge. Nonetheless, they're adequate, if not entirely convincing, as the teen sweethearts in this action adventure.File #4 under ""comics & pulps"", even tho it's adapted from the ""Pittacus Lore"" novel, because it surely has the look and feel of a graphic novel. Perhaps that's because screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar** are coming off a successful decade-long run as the creative forces behind the Superboy TV series Smallville, and they have a good handle on hunky teen survivors of a doomed alien race, come to Earth with amazing but as-yet-unrealized superpowers.Here the Forces of Darkness are the Mogadorians, who like Galactus travel the spaceways looking for sentient races to wipe out. They're big, with nosegills, laser cannons like the Predators, and a fondness for long, black Matrix-like dusters; their leader has a penchant for chortling threat-laden repartee that would do General Zod credit. They are determined to take out the 9 young potential heroes who survived the genocide of the peaceful planet Loria, but, since the Mogs are not merely evil but LAWFUL evil, they have an OCD compulsion to do so in strict numeric sequence, a la the Final Destination series. They've already accounted for Numbers 1 thru 3, bringing us to ""John Smith"" (Pettyfer), the eponymous next target up.At one point John snarls at a foe ""You have no idea what I'm capable of,"" but, like Percy Jackson and sorcerer's apprentice Dave before him, he himself has very little idea what he's capable of, so to some degree this is a coming-of-age story, complicated by teenage hormones. Each of the Lorian kids has her or his own warrior guardian. John's is Henri (Timothy Olyphant, for a wonder not playing a sheriff), filling the role of Sarah Connor and periodically ordering John to pack up everything, abandon everyone he knows, and lam out for his life. Their most recent relocation is to Paradise, Ohio, where John immediately befriends the 2 most dangerous kids in the high school: Sarah Hart (Agron), an obsessive and privacy-blind shutterbug who posts pictures of everybody on her Flickr account, right where the Mogs can find it with facial-recognition software; and Sam (Callan McAuliffe), the picked-upon science nerd who's completely into ancient astronauts and alien abductions and is always looking for evidence of space aliens.After a couple of days of nearly blown cover, Henri decides it's time to bug out again, but John finally balks, objecting that he won't abandon his true love. Henri acknowledges that Lorians pair-bond for life (similar to the Golden Compass heroine and her familiar), and that this complicates the road trip. Apparently it never occurs to either of them that the young lady in question might end up, like, ""Get away from me, Mr. Danger Magnet.""There's other stuff in here, too, like the shape-shifting stowaway salamander, Bernie Kosar the beagle, the full-of-himself bullying jock, spiral-design scars on John's legs (each psychically linked to one of his fellow Lorians), an heirloom box, a timely cameo appearance by #6, and whatever's banging around in the back of the big black truck the Mogs take with them everywhere.You'll notice that, aside from the previous paragraph, the rest of this review has been a cascade of similes. There is virtually nothing at all original about this movie. It's assembled from a conglomeration of interchangeable pieces of other plots. Nonetheless, if your Frankenstein's monster ends up looking more like Troy Donahue than Boris Karloff, you can end up with nearly 2 hours of pleasant escapism that won't strain your brain like something that had actual thot invested in it.The movie is very much open-ended, and I look forward to the inevitable sequel*** as more of the same, a boy's wish-fulfillment fantasy, fun enuf while it lasts but nothing with a remote chance of echoing down the corridors of history.Perhaps its ONLY contribution to history is that it's a run-of-the-mill movie on the giant Imax screen. Heretofore Imax has hosted only nature travelogs and big FX-heavy blockbusters.

69,colinrgeorge,Number Two,4,28 February 2011,"""I Am Number Four"" is Number Two. A cheap joke, but it's just what this adolescent stinker deserves. Granted, nigh unwatchable cinematic misfires haunt the calendar's early months, amongst whose company D.J. Caruso's latest foray into teen actioners is admittedly a god among insects. Copping a Michael Bay aesthetic (Bay produces), ""Number Four"" does ""Twilight"" by way of ""Transformers."" The film is slick, glossy, and absolutely uninteresting.Never mind that these characters are extraterrestrials from the planet Lorien, it's their blatant lapses in logic that seems most alien. After all, the good guys are identical to human beings (the bad guys have facial gills) in all but one key way. Cue our hero's warrior guardian with this hilariously hokey line: ""When we love, we love forever."" And that's ""Number Four"" in a nutshell: bleating sentimentality in the guise of a hip sci-fi thriller.The set-up is compelling enough. You have a persecuted alien race taking refuge on Earth, with nine bastions of hope for their civilization being systematically sought and destroyed by the evil (wince) Mogadorians. The movie opens with an effective prologue in which an ill- fated Number Three is chased down by his aggressors. But following that breezy and exciting sequence, the threat dissipates. Enter a gangly Alex Pettyfer as Number Four, Ohio-bound under the tutelage of his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant) and the brilliant alias, John Smith. Four has grown weary of his pull-up-stakes lifestyle and wants to settle into an average human existence; he, by choice mind you, wants to attend high school.At just shy of two hours, the majority of ""Number Four"" has little to do with the role our hero will come to play in what studio executives are surely salivating to call the next big franchise. This lame origin story is as much about cookie cutter bullies and teen angst as it is intergalactic war. Probably even more so. Between romancing his love interest (""Glee's"" Dianna Agron) and befriending a George McFly-esque dweeb, there are all the requisite puberty metaphors; at one point, Four's humiliating ability to shoot blue light from his palms prompts him to flee class for the comfort of a custodial closet.It does, however, grant the audience time enough to reflect on how flimsy the premise is under any scrutiny. Why is this would-be savior staking his life on integration with human teenagers? Why anyone over the age of 16 should care if he has a girlfriend is equally mysterious. Bring on the alien bloodshed! We glimpse the (cringe) Mogadorians in pursuit of Four throughout the film, but that they pull stunts like scaring children in adjacent cars on the highway make them laughable villains. They eventually steward some middle of the road action for ""Four's"" finale.Though the film is prettier than many mid-February releases, it ultimately earns its place among the calendar's infamous early months. Adapted from what, to all appearances, is a ""me too"" young adult fiction series, the big-screen version of ""I Am Number Four"" fails to distinguish itself in the company of ""Harry Potter"" and even the equally vapid ""Twilight"" saga. As little as I'd like to dwell on the latter, the characters are at least better realized. ""Four"" is populated by walking clichés and led by one of the most emotionally vacant action heroes in recent memory. They are the dull cogs that turn reluctantly beneath a shimmering veneer. ""I Am Number Four"" is a faulty piece of cinema, and a piece of something less pleasant still.",I Am Number Four

When he is suddenly discovered yet once again by his unseen pursuers and the footage ends up on the internet he once again flees with his guardian Henry (Timothy Olyphant ) to yet another town and try to live a normal life although being warned by Henry that going to school and actually leaving his house is highly dangerous.

73,blacklist-1,I am Number Four is an absolute bore. An excruciatingly awful film.,1,2 March 2011,"My god! Words cannot reiterate how terrible this movie is. I didn't go with high expectations. I didn't expect Oscar winning performances or a witty and sharp script etc. I thought if I could give it a five or a six out of ten at most I would be satisfied with some great action, good special effects and reasonable acting, but it didn't even have that. Seriously the reviewers who have given this higher than a four have seriously deluded themselves. I'm not a teenager, which this film is aiming for (but even then it's so badly made even they shouldn't like this).Before I critique this film. A brief synopsis from what I can gather. Teenager John Smith (Alex Pettyfer from Storm Breakers) who is an alien from another planet Lorien is a fugitive on the run from his enemies the Mogadarians who have been sent to destroy him after killing three other kids before him with the same abilities. Changing his identity, moving from town to town with his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant), John is always the new kid with no ties to his past. In the small Ohio town he now calls home, John encounters unexpected, life-changing events-his first love Sarah (Dianna Agron), powerful new abilities and a connection to the others like number six (Teresa Palmer) who shares his destiny. The first problem of this film is the screenplay which is a horrific mess. The synopsis I had to cobble together from a family friend who is a fan of the books (but wasn't of the film). It is very loosely explained during the movie at different points with huge plot holes. If these Mogadarians want to destroy earth, why don't they straight away? Why kill these teenagers who are a part of the legacy? How were the legacies and Mogadarians created? Why do the Mogadarians want to destroy earth? I think I heard something about ""resources,"" but what? Maybe this is explained in the book or subsequent ones, I don't know, but for someone who hasn't read them, things should have been explained and more clearly, it's no excuse. Also when John saves Sarah from her ex-boyfriend and his friends pestering her at the fair, she sees him using his powers (his hands light up) to deal with the guys, but she dosen't say anything??? What the heck? Then later she suddenly ""finds"" out? This sort of thing just reeks serious laziness on the hand of the writers, either that or during that scene Sarah went temporarily blind. I could go on with several other plot holes, but you get the point. The structure of the film is terribly put together with certain scenes just feeling so random, without them being linked together. Maybe the fact the film just suddenly decides to introduce new information in a convenient ""way"" like those weird creatures who guard the legacies (including a dog that turns into the creature) and the others for the Mogodarian's or whatever. And while we're on the subject of the Mogodarian's as villains they are ridiculously laughable and not scary in the slightest. All the characters are bland with little back story like we find out literally nothing about John's past or his parents. With that you just don't care about them as they are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Particularly when Henri dies, in one scene with ""sad"" music. We're meant to care but the characters are so shallow and boring we just don't care and the whole pathetic scene just comes across as sickeningly insincere. Of course the characters being boring also comes down to terrible performances. Alex Pettyfer is just unbearably plain and looks and acts bored. He hasn't got the slightest trace of acting ability (just like in Stormbreakers). None of the cast fare any better. They are all unconvincing and give some of the worst performances I've seen in films, even Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer's Apprentice could not save this. She looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. I couldn't judge her acting as such though her voice when I heard it sounded like she was trying to be sexy with a sore throat. The trollop scriptwriter who put in the embarrassingly awful and very cheesy NOT funny script that she should speak like that needs a slap.I am Number Four tries to come across as a romantic sci-fi action, but it has little action (for teen boys), only about ten minutes and even when there was, the camera jerked up and down with a shocking lack of continuity I felt dizzy and couldn't make out what was going on so as a result there is no excitement you feel in ""watching"" the action. (Michael Bay who was the producer of this and still hasn't learnt from Transformers 2) and little romance (for teen girls). With little romance or action, the film just pointlessly meanders itself sluggishly from scene to scene. In terms of the ""romance"" there is no chemistry between John and Sarah and even the special effects are very poor and look too obvious. The film is way too predictable with stereotypes across the board which you will notice straight away making it unimaginative and repetitive like the rest of the film. I paid £6.20 to see this abomination, I wish I hadn't. This is the first turkey of the year I've awarded for a film (suppose it was only a matter of time). This is just complete rubbish and I would not advise anyone to see this travesty. There will be sequels unfortunately but I certainly won't be signing up to see it. I would rather throw up thanks then put myself through seeing another one of these. Trust me I am Number Four is that crap. I would seriously advise you to skip it. It is one of the worst films I have ever encountered.",I Am Number Four
74,gcsman,Like a super-sized episode of Buffy. And wait for the entry of Number Six!,6,17 July 2019,"The first hour or so of this story look and feel like they just want to pile on standard tropes of teen sci-fi flicks and run them through a blender. An alien kid with Emerging Powers (""Number Four"", played by hunk Alex Pettyfer) is one of nine such survivors of his race, all of them hiding out on Earth from the thoroughly evil Mogadorians (huge guys in long black trench coats) bent on annihilating them. (Why?? not explained, and not terribly relevant if all you want is the tension and action.) It's a key to the plot that none of the nine kids knows where the others are. ""Four"" spends his time in a small-town high school complete with a beautiful but somewhat oddball new girlfriend, a nerdy sidekick, and of course dumb football jocks who torment them. So far, so routine. And it all, predictably, leads up to a big final battle between Four and the nasty aliens that trashes the school (where else?). For me, the only thing that kept me going to that point was more one of style: it's got a kind of cheerful, in-your-face energy and verve that help deliver the goods. It plays out like a super-sized episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, though admittedly without much of Buffy's trademark humor.But it's at that one-hour mark that the whole thing takes a terrific left turn. Near the beginning of the final battle when things are looking pretty bad for Four and his friends, in comes -- in truly spectacular fashion -- Number Six (Teresa Palmer), who bursts through the doors with guns blazing and who, in the next fifteen minutes, deploys an array of superpowers that any Marvel hero would envy. That lifted the whole film into something really worth watching.We do get to see Six in three *very* short scenes earlier in the film obviously intended to be mysterious setups, so it's not really cheating to have her suddenly make that big entry late in the story. But more than that, I call her the real hero of the story. Within the context of the storyline, ""Four"" has essentially been passive throughout: hiding out, living from moment to moment with no real plan, using his nascent powers only when pushed. Turns out that meanwhile, Six has been the proactive one. She's well ahead in her maturing powers, is deliberately seeking out the others of their kind, and starting to get them together. She's no-nonsense, tough as nails, and the only one who's actually acting on a plan.Credit also to some other details. Timothy Olyphant does well playing Four's (short-lived) protector, Kevin Durand has fun overacting as the head evil alien, and there's a cute beagle ... watch and have fun.",I Am Number Four
75,priyantha-bandara,Kick some Alien Enemies.. again!,6,9 May 2011,"D. J. Carusso has done his magic once again. I started to like his work after I watched 'Taking lives' back in 2004. And after some stunning movies like Disturbia (2007) and Eagle Eye (2008) he has returned to the silver screen with a possible promise of an ongoing movie series 'I am Number Four'.The plot has no twists or hard points to digest like some of Carusso's previous flicks. It's plain simple and straight forward. John (Alex Pettfyer) is practically an alien. He came to earth in order to survive the destruction of his home planet with 8 of others just like him. But their enemy is at unrest and chasing and killing them one by one. Gifted with special abilities and strengths John is getting ready for a war with the enemies who destroyed his planet. Already the first 3 of his people killed, Jason the 'Number Four' must survive in order to fulfill his legacy.Running from place to place with his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant), in a small town of Ohio he finds the girl which he falls for. And now both of them are to expect the wrath of the enemy while the enemy gets closer and closer in tracking them down. Packed with jaw dropping animation and thumping action sequences the movie is not boring at all. Mainly concentrated on the teenage crowed it has it little romantic moments which does not bother the main theme. There is no big character development as such but maybe since the ending hints of a sequel we might get to know them well in coming editions. Strongly with a touch of a super hero movie which the hero throws cars away just by pointing his hand towards it, John reminds me of our old hero Superman who landed on planet earth after his planet Krypton was under jeopardy. I wonder if John will become super powerful later on. And not to forget that there are 5 others just like him somewhere on earth with different abilities. John gets to meet one of them in this edition and tie up a league with her. And I think sweet dog will become a very important part of the plot and all this is ""IF"" there is a sequel. As still there are no solid leads on that taking place yes, this movie as one has a very loose ending. Seriously hang the viewers to dry without washing them properly!! If you expect to see a 'total' ending then don't expect it. This is fantasy and it's quite good. Fantasy movies are for enjoyment but not for serious criticism. So I rest my case at that point.my reviews at www.flickshout.blogspot.com",I Am Number Four

Acting-4 Cinematography-4 Name-4 Plot-4 Originality-0 This movie borrowed ideas from about every special effects movie in the past 20 years with no improvement, including the ludicrous weapons, nothing more than army issue from the 1990's. What a super race! As for the ""powers"" of John Smith et alia, not too bad, except when he uses his hand beams as flashlights. Seems a little underpowered. As for the plot... laughable. John has to go to school... for what? To fall in love? To learn algebra? That of course while he's supposed to remain in hiding. HAHAHA But the dog was good. Probably the best actor.",I Am Number Four
77,neenahhh,This movie did the book enough justice,7,6 March 2011,"It did. Except for them not giving a proper background story. I bet if I never read the book, I would have been kind of lost. Also the transitions between each scene wasn't the best. It just felt like it was jumping all over the place.The adaption was good, if not great. It was like how I imagined the events in the book to be- from the school to the Haunted Hay Ride. Only my imaginings of the characters were different. John was a brunette, Sam was nerdier, Mark was chubby and fat, Sarah was edgier, Number Six and Henri were nicer and the Mogadorians were scarier and wore more capes.I liked Sarah's hobby. I don't know why I felt the need to say that, but I did. Her photography and her site was pretty freaking awesome. It kind of inspired me. If ever I take an interest in documenting my life through photographs, I know who to thank. I mean, her room was awesome!I felt like there wasn't enough room for character development. Especially regarding Henri. We just saw him as a bossy old dude, until the part where he dies while saving John. I can't believe they killed him off there! They should have followed the book's storyline. Also, with the whole Sarah and John romance- that was too rushed. I mean, one day, then they kiss? How stupid. And when Sarah learned that John was not human, she didn't ask any questions. What the hell? Is she normal? I mean, I would have expected AT LEAST a few questions. Oh well.I was amazed by the fight scene. The book's description bored me, but I was really wide awake while watching the entire fight. Amazing graphics! It really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Number Six was totally badass, by the way.Overall, this movie would be a great way to pass time. It's full of action and lots of science fiction stuff. Fans of the book (who aren't particularly keen on details) will enjoy it. Well, I did. Give it a try.",I Am Number Four

Not Dr. Who, nor Star Wars, this teens gone alien is meant to follow the fangs of the silly Twilight series with an action-alien shoot 'em up for boys genre.With the exception of Timothy Olyphant as Henri, the acting is monosyllabic, bully quarterback, high school dork, scenario. Henri is meant to guard #4, and manages to keep him alive through the hormone high school years, but, alas, #4 thinks he's too informed about his alien situation to listen. Dumb teen agers live up to their stereotype of dumb in every sense of the word. Even the beagle is smarter than Four.Too predictable, too obvious, too unimaginative to really rate any attention. And, the ambiguous ending tries to drum up interest in a sequel. No, shoot it and put it out of its misery. One just plain bad film for the summer. Avoid.",I Am Number Four
79,jonnyfendi,Definitely Not a No. 1,5,25 May 2011,"If you think you can make another version of ""Twilight"" (2008) only by combining two good looking teen idols in one screen, you're completely wrong. Alex Pettyfer is John Smith, a mysterious boy who possesses extraterrestrial power in his hand. With his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant), they look like father and son but beneath it all they are aliens in human form, sought by a group of evil alien that called Mogadorian. Meanwhile, in his refuge Alex meets and falls in love with an ordinary girl named Sarah (Played by Glee's sensation, Dianna Agron). Initially, I thought it would be some kind of a romance with actions. Instead of that, it turns out to be pure action with a romantic background. The chemistry between Alex and Sarah actually went pretty smooth, but the proportion is too brief and not intense at all. The Director is D. J. Caruso who is well-known for ""Disturbia"" (2007) and ""Eagle Eye"" (2008). After one or two scenes in the beginning, the movie atmosphere reminds me of one of those ""Smallville"" TV series (2001-2011) which include the setting, the characters and the conflict. Most of the action scenes are good enough to watch, even though without any comprehensive explanation. Previously, I thought the Number Six character who is described as a sexy and energetic girl will be the scene stealer (played by my favorite rising star, Teresa Palmer). As a matter of fact, her character is too minor and there is an impression that she is just a mere sweetener. At the end, the movie is closed by a situation that opens a possibility of potential sequel. In summary, thiz is not a movie that you want to spend 100 minutes of your precious time. Unless, you are 16-year-old teen who is interested to watch thiz kind of movie, then you have to go to see it as soon as possible, before your friends have watched it first. For me, Thiz movie is definitely not a number one.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",I Am Number Four
80,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,Like a superhero movie without the passion.,5,18 August 2012,"Why is everyone comparing this to Twilight? I didn't catch that vibe at all. But I do have lots to say about it, and I'll start with the bad things. John starts out by being a combination of Iron Man and a flashlight. And how is he such a good fighter? Nobody uses Bing and nobody ever will, except in Hollywood movies. The soundtrack must have been compiled by Pitchfork, because I'm ashamed of knowing every song in it. And why must he have an iPhone? I'm getting a mixed message about sponsorship, what with Sam name-dropping Xbox and John having an iPhone.The antagonist, played by Young Bill Hader, has a sudden change of heart for no reason, and John actually leaves Sarah with him. But speaking of Sarah, she was radiant, and she was perfect, and honestly the only reason I kept watching. She seems like an amazing kisser, and I might even watch Glee for her. But it's hard to fit an entire relationship arc in a week's time and still be able to take it seriously. You just /know/ that it's probably not going to work out, so why waste your time hoping it will? Timothy Olyphant was cool, and Teresa Palmer (Number Six) was quite pretty, though at one point it seemed like she was doing her best Kristen Stewart impression. Alex Pettyfer was decent at best, and his hair was terrible. While I would like to see a sequel, I'm hoping for more than just fighting Mogs. Hopefully they'll find a good casting of the other Numbers.Good luck explaining the explosiony ending. Oh, it was produced by Michael Bay? Well there you go.",I Am Number Four

Yet he's acting like such a weak coward! No one that ridiculous deserves to have any powers at all. If you're so weak, so pathetic that you can't even beat the people who are so willing to beat you, then you deserve all the bad crap that happens to you.I'm so sick of movie makers coming up with crappy, weak shows featuring weakling, little baby characters with no strength, no backbone at all.

In this case, it's even worse: aliens whose races/planets names are either ridiculous or rip offs (Lorien? Are you serious?). The plot has got more holes than a swiss cheese, the size of elephants, and the whole thing seems to be made by -and marketed for- 12 years old. Funny that review titled ""twilight with balls"", because that's exactly what I thought while watching this junk: ""not another twilight, please"". Balls? I didn't see any.

That worked with Twilight, but with this one.... I don't know! Pattinson is not that good looking either, but this guy is just way too usual to be noticed.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The story is about a guy from another planet running away from some other guys from another planet that are trying to kill him. He is accompanied by Timothy Olyphant who i once considered charismatic before he started making bad movies. That is, he was never making good movies in the first place, but he was in a good television series and he did a part in a not so bad romantic comedy called The Girl Next Door that fit him perfectly. As for Teresa Palmer, i'm not sure about her acting skills, but she has her way on the screen. As far as presence goes, anyway. Unfortunately, her role sucks and she only has like ten minutes in the whole movie. That's what usually happens to women in Hollywood when they're not playing someone's love interest, i guess.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> And as for CGI, man it sucks. I don't even see the point of monsters in this film. They just ruin it even more.

All the shots, or most at least, were done without any unnecessary shaky camera technique and it looked good. If there only wasn't for those dumb out of space guns all of it would've looked much better! Generally speaking.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I don't have to mention dumb writing that consists, from storyline to dialogue, of pretty much any cliché out there. Bad, but than again, if not taken seriously it's good enough for what it is. The movie is fun to watch and never boring, and that's why i gave it a six. In difference to Twilight, which tries to be serious but is ultimately dumb and boring, writing in this one is decent! And the movie it self! It is what it is, which is a dumb teenage flick with some Star Trek makeup about some blonde guy and so on... If you liked Twilight you will definitely like this.

89,TheSeaLion,What can only be described as schlock.,3,1 August 2013,"Before I saw this film in theaters, I read the book by James Frey and Jobie Hughes. I was entertained by the book and thought it was an amazing story so, naturally, I wanted to see the movie. Not only was it a bad film, it was a premonition of how bad the book series was going to get.We start out with the murder of a teenage boy by an alien force called the Mogadorian. After that, boy number four is whisked away from his house in Florida to go to Ohio to continue hiding. There, he meets a girl named Sarah and yes, this is already a story that we have hundreds of. As his time in the town goes by, his relationship with Sarah and his legacies (special powers) grow. It is a story based around a novel that takes away all of the drama elements of the book like the character development and just keeps the action sequences and spends too much time on the visuals, sound like any other films you know?This movie, to me, is another example of a series of popular young adult novels that are taken and made into movies without any time put into them because they will make money either way. There is always the exception to the rule like with the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" series, but with ""I Am Number Four"", it falls into the category of taking a popular young adult book to make lots of money. A movie that is good for someone who just wants to watch a bunch of action sequences without any attempt at characters or story, then this is a movie for you.

Here's the lowdown **spoilers**:The basic concept has a whe slew of significant plot holes. A bunch of alien teenagers live on earth, nine of them, and some other aliens come to kill them. We're never really told why: why are the alien teenagers being killed (in sequence, no less)? why is it necessary to kill them in the first place? why do they act so stupid? Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention. Other than that, it's pretty well-worn territory: a kid discovers he has super powers, battles the school bully, falls for the hottest girl in school, beats the aliens and saves the day. That's it. That's the entire plot right there. Acting: pretty bad. The main character is a bit if a plank. Of course the hottest girl at school falls for him, despite him having the personality of a piece of wood. The bully is suitably obnoxious, the baddies trying to channel KISS and make jokes. It doesn't work all that well. SFX: pretty good, but that's to be expected these days. So why does it suck so hard? Well, firstly the plot is dull, dull, dull. The kid is running for his life, three of his alien mates have already been killed, so he goes to high school? I mean, come on! Not only that, he doesn't try to hide that he's an alien with a secret to protect, but mopes around lusting after the hottest girl in school. It's not a bad plot as such, just badly done. Timothy Olyphant must be hard up for cash these days. Oh wait, what am I saying? He was in Hit-man already. The baddies are just sad and comical (although not actually funny), rather than menacing. And then, you find out that these moron alien kids hadn't actually thought of teaming up to fight the enemy together, despite it being common knowledge that by joining forces they could defeat them. Who'd a thunk it?It was never going to be a great movie, but it could have done it better. All the ingredients are there, but it's let down by a poorly written script. I'm sure it'll do well at the cinema with the 13 yr old crowd. By all means go see it.

91,austin-takahashi,I Am Number Four - Zero Stars,1,20 March 2013,"""I Am Number Four"" is an insolent and oblivious lump of trash that has been reused and recycled by countless studios controlled by cash- chugging dimwits. Even the most careless of eyes won't fail to notice its touches of unacceptable stupidity. The movie is so incompetently made that it doesn't even meet the incredibly low standards of a Dumb Action Movie. ""I Am Number Four"" is significantly lower than that.The story revolves around a hunky, probably shape-shifting alien who is on a crucial mission to, uhm Forget it. I have no idea what this is about. Why I can't tell you the movie's plot line may not exactly be my fault. In an earlier scene, Number 4, the alien, makes use of quick, lazy narration in an attempt to explain to us his past life, present predicament, and future threats. What we know is that he was originally from the planet Loraine, which was destroyed by the douchey Mogadorians. Nine children, blessed with extraordinary powers, were able to escape and flee to Earth with one guardian assigned to each of them. Number 4 was one of the children. The others are Number 1, 2, 3 and so on.What we don't know are these: How did the Numbers travel to Earth? Why Earth? How did they land here without getting noticed? Why do they look like us? Can they change their appearance? How long have these invading imposters been here? What do they do for a living? Why do the Mogadorians want them dead? How did the Mogadorians land here without getting noticed? Since they've already killed Numbers 1, 2 and 3, how were they able to operate in stealth while basting their alien cannons in all directions? Why does Number 4 enroll in a school after finding out that the Mogadorians want him dead? Shouldn't he be busy with more important things? Does this movie have a subtle message that school should be prioritize above everything else?

92,jonnyhavey,Sci-Fi Angst: Improvement and Potential,6,23 February 2011,"Director D.J. Caruso's (""Disturbia"", ""Eagle Eye"") ""I Am Number Four"" marks the birth of a new science fiction series aimed at a very loosely established audience. The film is based on the book with the same name written by Pitticus Lore. It is being released almost simultaneously to the public in the two different mediums. DreamWorks Studios and Producers Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay took on a big leap of faith producing the film and while the film shows a lot of potential for the series, something just was not right. The film stars a young cast including newcomer Alex Pettyfer in the leading role. Pettyfer's character goes by many names in the film including Daniel and Number Four, but for simplicity purposes his character's name is John. John was one of nine children sent to earth from the alien planet Lorien to save them from their planet's destruction. The mortal enemies of their race known as the Mgadorians are responsible and fallowed them to earth. The nine have a special bond with each other making each of them immortal unless they are killed in numerical order. The Mogadorians have already killed the first three and John is number four. John and his projector Henri (Timothy Olyphant, ""The Crazies"") are constantly on the move but now things are real as John takes sanctuary in Paradise, Ohio. While trying to stay under the radar a teen love affair starts between him and a girl named Sarah (Dianna Agron, ""Glee""). Sarah has become a loner in the school because of nasty rumors created by her ex-boyfriend and captain of the football team, Mark (Jake Abel). John's only other friend is Mark's favorite harassment target, Sam (Callan McAuliffe). In other words, typical high school drama ensues, but how long will Mark be John's biggest problem? Will Number Six (Teresa Palmer, ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"") find John before the Mogadorians do? Despite the obvious flaws in the overall scheme of the film, ""I Am Number Four"" proves that the series has a lot of potential. This can be attributed to a very well thought out casting process. Dianna Agron and Callan McAuliffe both portray their characters very well for having very little acting experience (Agron having much more of the two). However, even with Agron's star power, no one is better in the film than Alex Pettyfer. He has a surprisingly good performance breaking away from the bad acting pretty boy stereotype that Taylor Lautner reinforces with each new ""Twilight"" installment. Pettyfer works alongside special effects exemplifying his powers and a cliché plot to create a very entertaining film, showing that he is a star in the making.""I Am Number Four"" lucked out with a very good young cast, however, the seasoned Teresa Palmer failed to provide support. Palmer's character relies too much on one-liners and the creation of a vastly overdone, annoying, badass vigilante. This can be attributed to a poorly written adaptive screenplay that over glamorizes the film. The writing lacked consistently portraying the sequence of events slowly, fully developing events at the start and rushing to the finish in order to cram too much story in less than two hours. The portrayal of the Mogadorians was especially flawed creating a mockery of them instead of creating a sense of veiled, dark, power. The special effects associated with them along with the animated creatures in the film lacked identity, coming off as fake.A roller coaster ride through a vortex of ups and downs, and of good and bad leaves the ""I Am Number Four"" series a lot of room for improvement. It's a film about an unknown and unreleased potential that its a-list producers saw the question is what is the next step?",I Am Number Four
93,TheHrunting,"Teens, love and alien numbers",4,24 June 2011,"This is a person-with-special-abilities movie involving a teen at the center along the lines of ""Smallville,"" ""Jumper,"" ""Harry Potter,"" ""Twilight,"" ""Percy Jackson"" and ""Push."" John (Alex Pettyfer) moves around with his protective guardian and mentor Henri (Timothy Olyphant) to elude these tall, pale, bald things called ""Mogadorians."" After trouble elsewhere, involving normal people finding out part of who he really is, John and Henri find a home sweet home in Paradise, Ohio: a place where instead of running away it all comes together with real friends who might actually understand him.John is the fourth of his kind of protectors of Earth, though this hunky, human-look-alike with the exception of glowing hands and calves hails from a planet called ""Lorien"" along with eight others. Three are tracked, hunted down and killed by the Mogs and John's number is up next, that is unless he can keep his powers to himself and control them. This is reminiscent of the whole Spider-Man motto: ""With great power there must also come great responsibility,"" not to mention discipline and restraint. All things the normal person might pervert, and that's what typically separates heroes from villains: self-sacrifice vs. personal gain. Except the Mogs are a little more extreme as they don't want to colonize Earth, they want to decimate it--you know, those kind of savage villains of the '50s stock who look exaggeratedly hideous and are so one-dimensional that you're forced not to like 'em considering everyone else is normal or pretty.Where Superman could easily fly into a telephone booth and comb his hair the other way without anyone suspecting a thing, our guy, Number Four, has 21st century technology to dodge his appearance getting out such as video streaming sites and web pages to spread photography of his presence, which is too tempting for him to contain. He's found a quirky friend to stick up for, who coincidentally has a thing with aliens and UFOs. Though he's got more than one enemy on his list, with the newest being the egomaniac school bully who comes in between a newly met, photographer girl to further complicate the challenge of forbidden love a la ""Twilight."" This is where the pacing turns somewhat light-hearted and melodramatic (think WB broadcasting) to show that people with extraordinary skills deep down inside have desires and deal with problems just the same. Though it creates a slower middle with the whole token, fairyland-in-modern-times love interest subplot and takes away from the fast moving pace it starts and finishes with. The last action sequence is loaded with special effects and involved a high-octane battle involving shootouts with alien weapons and odd looking alien beasts.""I Am Number Four"" squeezes every other convention into it of the last decade. It borrows from established big-budget pictures to create a recognizable formula that feels secure: aka cash-in. While it's a little more pliable and less shameless than others who straight take a formula, it still feels like they're camouflaging this as something you've already seen with different names, faces and only a few things shuffled around. This isn't going to be like ""Heroes"" where there is at least someone in the cast that you can gravitate towards, as the relatability factor of ""I Am Number Four"" is aimed towards a certain demographic with hardly any other punches pulled outside of its box. There are all kinds of things to learn and grow from, except it's slated towards an up-and-coming teen who doesn't know where they place themselves in life amongst the pecking order just yet, as it shows by example how these characters made it through in mostly one piece and gives courage to do so yourself. They do it, you don't, no one gets hurt, though it all kind of gets tiring after awhile with everything so smoothly falling into place by fate or coincidence.

The characters were good, some more interesting than others and the plot was different wand kind of cool. Alex Pettyfer was quite decent in his acting abilities, not Oscar worthy but not as bad as Zac Efron. Dianna Argon who plays Number 4's love interest wasn't that bad. you feel like maybe she'll not be a deep character but as the film progresses so does her character and you like her more as the film goes on. I liked how her character wasn't a blonde bimbo cheerleader, but she was a girl who pursued her passion in photography meaning she left her popularity behind and how she feels she doesn't really fit anywhere because she is her own person. There were some standout action sequences which were brilliant and of course the effects and action was really good. But it did lack depth, the film played on the clichés of dealing with the issues of High School problems (such as the bad casting of the bully and about high school romances) and moving to different places and starting a new life. I loved how they made the villains really bad, nothing obvious or silly but they were genuinely creepy and evil.

95,blackmambamark,Michael Bay......please stop,6,24 February 2011,"If i could force one director into retirement, it would easily be Michael Bay. The man produces the most cringe worthy dialog, and the most cliché' sequences. Many may argue that if it wasn't for him, there wouldn't be those big budget blockbusters. Uh, correction........if it wasn't for those talented visual effects artist and million dollar executive producers, then we wouldn't have those movies. Yes, i realize that he is not directing this movie. It is DJ Caruso's job......but i cannot help but think that Bay will be pulling all the strings. Case in point, ""Nightmare on Elm St."".The movie starts out like any other Michael Bay flick. Every character is beyond good looking, the main character has trouble fitting in, there is always a hot blonde who is Australian, and the first 30 to 45 minutes is filled with a boat load of High School Drama sequences. Okay, i get it, you hated jocks as a teen. You do not need to make the quarterback the villain for the first half of the movie. I mean come on, it's a movie about a closet superhero alien who is on the run from renegade bad guys from outer space. Making a jock the villain just doesn't add up. Well, unless I'm watching the Disney channel.However, i do think the concept for this film is alright. It does have some slight potential. But it is literally short lived. Mainly because every single sequence is topped off with the cheesiest one-liner. I honestly believe that if this film wasn't put together by these two doofuses, then there might have been something here.Bottom Line.......This movie would be great for your 8 year old. In fact, no it wouldn't. Because i couldn't live with myself if i raised my kids on crappy dialog filled movies. It's a dull witted attempt to create an ""X-Men"" type series. But it came off like the movie ""Jumper"".....oh wait, who directed that again?",I Am Number Four
96,diescobarmdq,Is that it?,6,7 August 2020,It was good. But by the end of the movie I felt like it had just started. I definitely wanted to see more. It would make a good Netflix show to know more about the aliens and their powers.,I Am Number Four
97,dagallop,Great watch during lock down!,8,30 August 2020,"I cannot believe that I missed this movie!This is a well written, well directed, well acted and well made movie. I am more disappointed that I managed to miss this movie, but thanks to the lock down, I have a growing list and this was on it.The sad part is that because this movie was made some time ago, it meant that there may be a follow on that I could watch in quick succession, but, it appears that the production house has not and probably never will. That is great disappointment for me.There is literally nothing bad to say about this movie other than it tries to follow the original stories and loses the plot from time to time. But, the story and action is immersive enough that it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of it.Synopsis: great action/fantasy movie that centers around teens, but doesn't get harmed in the process. Frankly a better story than anything Marvel or DC have on their books right now and sadly probably the one and only. Nothing too horrific to scare your kids but probably too much for pre-teens!",I Am Number Four
98,paulONeil68,Its ok,8,2 January 2021,"It's a good enough teen film. Sadly the writer went with the sappy stuff more than the alien stuff..
The neard is cool
So is the beagleSpecial effects are good and a lot more money has been spent on them , than sharknado CGI for example.The story is good the ending is a good battle the finale goodbyes is not needed, too twilighty for me.Most reviewers will be saying its lame but then the last 29 years so have been the people watching",I Am Number Four
99,graves-scott,I Saw Formula Number Four,2,2 June 2018,"The movie faithfully follows the formula of the strange kid who moves around too much to make friends.

BUT I was more than pleasantly surprised by the ease with which the action-packed film zipped along. Yes, it is a story of a 'loner' in search of his place in the universe (he is an alien in the US), but that internal conflict carries the story aloft with good acting (not played for Flash Gordon camp). Timothy Olyphant is a scene steal-er and a fine actor...and the younger performers are quite relaxed as they confront sci-fi trickeries at every corner.A big smile occurred with the reappearance, at the end (not really a spoiler). Don't avoid this film...it will give you a couple of enjoyable hours...and, yes, i do kinda hope that the series continues...I still want to know about the BOX!!",I Am Number Four

102,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: I Am Number Four,5,18 April 2011,"Part teen drama, part sci-fi and part coming of age is how I would best describe this one and I don't think that amalgamation came together as well as it could have, which if I'm being honest would not have been very good anyway.I Am Number Four is about a boy called John (Alex Pettyfer). He is no ordinary boy but an alien that has found himself on planet Earth with his guardian, Henri (Timothy Olyphant) who helps to protect him. Protect him from what you ask? John is being tracked down my the mysterious enemy of his race known as the Mogadorians who are intent on destroying every last one of his kind. In the opening scene of the movie we are shown the demise of one of his kind, the aptly named Number 3. Therefore for some reason that is never expanded upon, John is next as he is Number 4! Quite why the Mogadorians have an OCD killing problem is also beyond the scriptwriters knowledge- all we know is that in total there are 9, 3 are dead and poor John is next.In order to stay safe, both John and Henri have to keep moving towns so that they are harder to find. They end up in Paradise, Ohio where John settles into a high school and our teen drama begins where he gets bullied by the jocks, hangs out with the geeks and falls for a girl (Dianna Agron) as in every other high school movie. We must now add to this the need for John to harness his powers which he is only just becoming aware of and to keep his real identity a secret. Remind anyone of some TV series called Smallville? This movie tends to mish-mash other ideas and tries to turn it into something new rather than be original which is ironic considering this is one of the few new movies out that is not based on anything or a sequel/prequel to something else- it's an unoriginal original!The Mogadorians are convincing as an enemy but not what I would call that scary with shaved tattooed heads, sharper teeth and a enhanced ability to smell the only thing distinguishing them from anyone else. The CGI for some of the monsters was a bit basic as well leading to an altogether average experience.Other things that made this not quite my cup of tea (which is strange because in general I am a fan of sci-fi) were simple things such as the baddies guns all fired red light and the goodies all fired blue- could you get any more stereotypical! Or the fact that the movie didn't really have a conclusion in the normal sense of the word i.e. they have definitely left it open for there to be a sequel. In fact thinking about it, this concept would probably have worked better as a series rather than a movie.Summing up then, I Am Number Four didn't do it for me. There was the potential for a decent storyline but the background detail was glossed over and it felt very 'samey' when comparing it to other ideas already out there. Saying that though I never felt it drag and the movie passed the hours without me demanding my time back at the end of it. One to watch if you want a sci-fi action but don't want to think too hard.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",I Am Number Four
103,LJStephens1980,Interesting.,8,17 February 2011,"Caught on advance screening, Thursday Evening on 17/2, and it was O.K. By combing several genres, (whilst not new), I really enjoyed it.Big rap, to Alex Pettyfer, Timothy Olyphant, and Dianna Agron. All three actors were very good. Furthermore, the story, wasn't all stero-types, and stayed focused. Whilst pandering to the X-Files, seems a tad worn, it doesn't distract from the overall momentum of the film.Now, I will say it loud: PLEASE only make sequels, to further develop the story, aka: Lord of the Rings. No prequels, please, as I can't stand them. And if there aren't to be any sequels, the better it is for the audience. LET them Make Up Their Own Minds, as To What Will Happen Next.",I Am Number Four

(And so is this movie!)It is so easy to rip this movie apart, I'll be a bitter, wrinkled old man by the time I am finished. So I won't!... (OK, maybe just a little bit.)1. The movie starts with a guy pole volting through the jungle like you wouldn't believe. In pitch black darkness too, but that's alright. If I were to do something this bad I would be willing to do ANYTHING to hide it.2. Then there is a gratuitous day at the beach montage, featuring a skinny babe in an orange bikini. For all of five seconds!3. Then there is some boring monologue and dialog. And then some ""Oh noes, not another teen movie"" crap.But no matter how bad this movie is, there are some valuable lessons to take away from it:1. If you're hunted by aliens, in the jungle, at night, never ever turn your back on the door. And kill those lights!, for Pete's sake.2. The truck sized frog/dog/flying praying mantis type thing... not working.3. If the bad guy's only ability is moving in slow-motion... don't bother.4. Never ever EVER say ""Fore!"". Whatever you do, don't say that. Anything else is better. ""Catch!"", ""Fetch!"", ""Here Kitty Kitty!""... Anything!... Fore??!!I Am Number Four. I feel older. And bitter. 2/10.",I Am Number Four
105,Jerominator,Teen Angst meets Alien Genocide,5,20 May 2013,"To be honest I would never have watched this if I'd known the setup but I thought it was an adult affair.It's one of those production line teeny high school issues-ridden stories that just happens to coincide with a alien story(or vampire story, or angel story bla bla bla bla BLAAAAAAA). I'v avoided all of these since The Faculty and I walked right into this one.So anyway the idea is that the last survivors of an alien genocide are hiding out on Earth hunted by unreasonable menacing adversaries. The survivors are gifted with special powers to make the movie more exciting, ahem, I mean to protect their now annihilated people(great job so far guys).Cue all the usual humdingers that murder these ideas for me:alien race anatomically identical to the human race, even down to their bleached highlights and American/Australian accents. Oh cmon!Same goes for the evil aliens, except for some tattoos, odd teeth and pointless gills. So enough to differentiate them but an easy morning for the make up ladyEvil aliens seem remarkably comfortable with Earth lingo/culture, yet act awfully strange in every other respect ..... ""yeah we're really strange and sinister remember - grrrrr"".All the aliens know how to drive cars and ride jetskis and stuff. OK they could learn this - it still annoys me on some level though.So why the higher mark then? Well I genuinely like the basic idea, if you strip out the teen stuff. OK OK so I'm 41 - but I reckon Id have felt the same way when I was 15 in all honesty - there's something horribly corny about how Hollywood presents all of that - so clichéd and nothing like my experience of school - plus we all know the teenagers in these films are really in their late 20s! The acting was actually rather good on the part of Olyphant, Petyffer, McAuliffe, Agron, and some of the effects were really well done. The whole thing had a nice polished look and feel to it. This really elevated the whole thing for me and I have to say I mostly enjoyed it despite going ""tssssk tssssk"" at the teen nonsense and the trying-way-too-hard wannabe Matrix girl at the end.It's just a darn shame the acting and production values were wasted on such a naff clash of ideas and clichés.p.s. Major spoiler .... after his utterly inexplicable road-to-Damascus style transformation from evil bully into heroic good guy, Biff, I mean Mark, retrieves the jewellery box, I mean spooky box of secrets for John at the end.

106,TourettesPersonal,Caruso The Generic,4,23 February 2011,"Let's try to go back to 2008. We got ""Eagle Eye"", It's a mixture of various sci-fi flicks. Now we have ""I Am Number Four"". Yeah it's based on a book, but everything you see is familiar. I just noticed most of Caruso's sci-fi movies have clichéd ideas. Is it the writer's fault? Some of the dialog is also generic. The special effects looks so homemade(look at the lasers). The actors have murmur problem. ""I Am Number Four"" is underrated in a bad way.If the nine aliens are so powerful, why can't they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I've never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence.The action scenes? Well D.J. Caruso is good at one of those, but here it's messed up. The special effects is so inferior it felt like they used Adobe After Effect(except those giant monsters but still looks cheap). The effects ruined the action of this film. Clashing unreal things and look at those colors. The lasers.The performances? Alex Pettyfer thinks he's cool but he's obviously not. Teresa Palmer is hot but she only kicks ass in the third act. Timothy Olyphant was disappointing. A pro actor playing a boring guardian.Overall ""I Am Number Four"" is as lifeless as ""Twilight""(sequels). Or more lifeless I guess. The action scenes could have been better. The characters thinks they're cool and awesome. They are dull actually. The rest is cliché. Generic. Etc. Is it worth watching? No. How about skipping the first and second act. The third act is the only entertaining part of the movie. But I'm warning you. It's an easy generic forgettable film.",I Am Number Four

If I would have checked, at least the genre (Teen, Fantasy), I would have saved one hour of my time. I remember once I had seen the book with the same title being placed on the 'bestsellers' rack of a popular bookstore and hence, the wastage.There is no point in talking more about the movie which is clearly targeted towards dreamy-eye teenagers turned on by blue eyed romance, extra-terrestrial conflicts and superhuman fantasies.

Taken from a successful book, the writers appear to have stitched this thing together with every cliché existent in the genre. EVERYTHING is soooo familiar. A bastardized cross between Twilight, Superman and a multitude of other heroic stories, I Am Number Four has a bunch of likable actors and half-decent action sequences that are interminably punctuated by stultifyingly bad romantic scenes that any TV soap opera would instantly consign to the reject bin. Who wrote this crap? Neither fish nor fowl, the movie sinks under the uncertainty of just what it was aiming for. Like they say, too many cooks spoil the broth and it is obvious this movie was written by a committee. Where did the bad guys come from, some Halloween party in a naughty part of town. (Not a bad part of town because they are just waaaay too laughable to be REAL bad.) One really pulls for the actors in this movie but the material they are given is insulting in its juvenile approach. Obviously aimed for an undiscerning teen market, this flick lands with a clunk at the feet of the impressionable eight year old who hasn't been out in a while.

(how did he get from the school janitor cupboard home again with his protector) you will see what I mean. However, there are some decent action set pieces and the evil Mogadorian Commander played by Kevin Durand of 'Lost' fame does enough snarling to be enjoyable. Number four is an alien on earth and although next in line to be assassinated, his extraordinary powers help him fight off both high school jocks & bad very bad E.T's. With the help of number six with an outrageous Aussie accent (which is Teresa Palmer's own), four goes on a rampage to save the earth and keep his photographer girlfriend (Dianna Agron - GLEE) alive. As mentioned, things may move fast but it often leaves one wondering what just happened. Spielberg produces and you know it is going to be at least half decent.

112,a-little-squeek,more like a pile of number two,2,31 August 2011,"....maybe not a big steaming pile but a pile nonetheless....it plays more like a made for TV movie than something one would pay ten bucks in the theater to see. I wrote checks and paid my bills while I was watching it. It's really a teen-geared movie with the shmoe-tagonist repeatedly evading his pursuers from another planet while contemporary music plays in the back ground. The hunters are big and weird looking and STRONG, and have some of the best lines in the movie. They blow up when they're killed. Everything else turns into dust and blows away after dying. Saves on a lot of messy cleanup after battles are over. The prey has a guardian, Timothy Olyphant(?) whose acting talents are pretty much wasted in this, and he also has some super powers to protect himself. It's mildly interesting/entertaining with half way decent effects and if you get it at Redbox like I did for a buck, you'll have paid exactly what I think it is worth.",I Am Number Four

Did it hit on all cylinders? No, but I liked a majority of the film.I'm a Jesus freak, so I see this movie from a unique perspective. I thought it was interesting that ""the gifts"" were being hunted down and exterminated by the evil alien empire of bald guys in black robes.In the Christian church there are people called cessanist, who believe all the gifts of the Holy Spirit (healing, prophecy, miracles, etc...) are done working in our time, that push to stop the teaching of such things as valid for today. I highly doubt anyone involved in making the movie thought of such a parallel, but that is the beauty of art. We can all see what we wish.Anyways, spiritual pondering aside, the movie can stand on its own two feet. I thought the acting was decent and the story moved quickly enough to keep me interested. Sure it could be compared to Twilight, but at this point in life everything has been done. It is just a matter of if it is done well.

115,Nyx_Selene,Worse than I expected,3,22 March 2012,"and nothing I haven't seen before. I'm sure a lot of tweens will be content drooling over Alex Pettyfer, but I'm growing weary with this plot line.Alex Pettyfer here plays John – a young human-looking alien (seriously, why can't we be invaded by aliens who don't look human for a change?) with very inhuman powers. He is one of a number of aliens meant to grow up to be protectors. They each have a number, and can only be killed in sequence, and they each have a warrior protector themselves – probably because their powers don't manifest 'til they're well into their teens.The aliens trying to kill them off look like well, take a Romulan from the new Star Trek movie, give it gills and a complete set of small, pointy teeth, and there you have them. They travel along with some pets, that look like the mini-versions of the giant Cloverfield monsters. I kid you not – there's nothing overly creative about alien/monster design here.The movie mainly shows John going to school, and falling in love with a blond girl. Only towards the ending do we get a bit of action, when the villains finally catch up with our good guy, but not even then did I feel tension or excitement. Not only because it really takes most of the excitement out of a movie when the major villain sounds retarded (to no surprise, since they're so stupid it's embarrassing), but also because I've seen this so many times now. The story is always about a teenager, who always acts like an idiot, who's always prepared to let the world go to hell rather than stay away from the teen crush. I know that our understanding of consequences isn't fully developed until we're about 20 years old, but the choice between saving the world and answering a text message should be a no-brainer for most people. Not for these dopes, though. Not until they've gotten their protector killed anyway – which they always do.The effects weren't bad, but that's the only good thing I can say about this very boring, unoriginal movie.",I Am Number Four

It feels as if someone from the studio said, ""You guys need to keep this under 2 hours, but keep the whole Teen Angst and Teen Love Story in there, and develop that sub-plot to the max. Oh, and the Sam and his Dad sub-plot too.""This film wastes so much time trying to trying to bury itself in Teen Angst and issues that are completely unrelated to the plot.So, we're basically left with a 110-minute film that rushes through the whole back-story, at least 3 sub-plots, and character development on at least 4 major characters and 3 independent species. Geez! I had to rewind the film 5 times and take notes just to keep up with it.Now, we're left with paper-thin characters, precious little background, and a budget-cut CGI sequence with a shape-shifter we've barely met.The irony is...

The part of the preordained chief protagonist trying to merge into ""normal everyday life"" - and failing - was clumsily represented. The usual tacky storyline - Number Four endangering his life for puppy love, the sober growing-up ritual of losing a father figure, the fugitives idiotically exposing themselves for bidding farewell to his lady love, relying on just-in-time rescue from unexpected sources, etc. And for most parts of the film, all No. 4's gift appeared to do was to save him the trouble of a flashlight!",I Am Number Four

Necessary music, heavy and melancholic to create suspense. Music created for this movie, cheerful and to create rhythm.2 - A guy with white skin and a menacing look chases a young man through the forest. He kills him with a knife. Filmmmakers do not have balls to show blood or blows. The body of the kid disappears in smoke (is this some joke?).3 - Movie changes quickly for a group of kids playing at Beach and surfing.There are no developments, except that kids have muscles. Girls between the ages of 18 and 21 are half naked and come back to the party with the boys. 4 - A kid in the middle of a sexual act with a girl in the sea, is surprised by an entity or the same guy with white skin (chiché), the scene is accompanied with the sound of a joyful music, improper to create suspense or tension (do filmmakers really know what they're doing with this movie). I think the entity was communicating to the boy of his destiny as savior or saving messiah of that world.The entity leaves the kid with marks on the body. Again chiché.5 - The kid has family problems, especially with his father. Again chiché and old. Development goes faster than a moon rocket. Without development, how I can understand these characters, or what they are, or what they think.6 - This movie is dead after 10 minutes.

The way the bad guys were introduced made me believe that they were going to be just a bunch of mindless creatures that want to kill everything and everyone in their path.But then came the boss villain played by Kevin Durand in ""The Gadget Scene."" I won't dare say another word about it here, let's just say that that scene saved the movie and made it much more interesting.Kevin Durand is the boss of all the villains in this film and does a great job. He is a very underrated actor who many people tend to overlook. If the film ""Legion"" hadn't sucked so bad, fans may have remembered his amazing teary-eyed performance as Archangel Gabriel. His best performance (in my opinion)is as Little John alongside Russell Crowe in ""Robin Hood"" Until Kevin Durand is offered the kind of film projects that are going to show fans just how good of an actor he really is, we'll have to settle for his occasional bad guy roles. At least he plays villains with substance, and that's all there is too it...",I Am Number Four
126,mysteryfan04,Trying to Be Too Many Things at Once,4,21 February 2011,"I Am Number Four is a sci-fi thriller which focuses around Number Four. He is an alien who is living on Earth in order to hide from the Mogadorians, evil aliens who attacked his home planet, Lorien. While hiding in Paradise, Ohio, he befriends a bullied science nerd named Sam and an aspiring photographer named Sarah. The film tracks his relationships with both characters while he prepares to defeat the Mogadorians. I Am Number Four starts out with a solid first twenty minutes. The tension, electrifying visuals, and promise are all there. The film's prime failure is that it is trying to be so many things at once. The film quickly converts into a Twilight meets Harry Potter meets Percy Jackson wannabe. Alex Pettyfer and Dianna Agron (as Number Four and Sarah respectively) have chemistry, but unlike Twilight, the relationship comes across as a distracting subplot that doesn't go anywhere. In terms of plot, there is no build-up. A few basic and barely coherent details are given but the film fails to expand on these details. Numerous events occur and twenty minutes later, the movie just ends without any emotional value. Pettyfer, Agron, and Teresa Palmer (as another alien) are either boring or over-the-top. Callan McAuliffe (as Sam) and Timothy Olyphant (as Pettyfer's guardian) are the only saving graces. The action sequences are also very generic. There are a couple of humorous lines scattered throughout I Am Number Four, but the final result is amateurish, occasionally ridiculous, and mostly boring.",I Am Number Four
127,FanPerspective,I Am Number Four is an intense thrill ride that won't leave you disappointed,9,19 February 2011,"Capturing everything that was so great and exhilarating about the book, D.J. Caruso is able to deliver an intense sci-fi thriller that won't leave you disappointed. Following the life of an alien boy (Alex Pettyfer) as he moves from town to town with his guardian, Henri (Timothy Olyphant), changing identities and hoping to stay hidden from the band of evil Mogadorians that are bent to destroy him and those of his kind that remain. Taking on the identity of John Smith, he once again becomes the new kid with a fabricated past as they settle in the small town of Paradise, Ohio. Things begin to heat up for John, though, as he begins to gain his powers and feel a connection with the others like him; he also falls in love with a girl (Dianna Agron) for the first time. He cannot allow himself to be distracted, though, as three are already dead and he is Number Four. While the book gets a slight alteration, writers Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Marti Noxon do a great job at keeping it as true to the original text as possible. There is never a dull moment throughout the film from its intense opening to its bad-ass action-packed climax; you're on a rush of adrenaline from start to finish. The casting was undeniably perfect. You didn't see any of those characters as the actors portraying them, but you believed that it was all real; you felt the connections between them. Teresa Palmer, who plays Number Six, is rather mysterious but she is a dame who packs a hardcore punch and she just electrifies on screen during the fight scenes. Callan McAuliffe, who plays John's best friend Sam, also did a fantastic job... this being his first major role, and I'd say it will be his big breakout; he played the school reject but he gave the character a quirky charm and real confidence. The special effects were top notch and the makeup for the Mogadorians was astounding; very original and definitely a perfect fit for menacing, evil aliens. If you're looking to have a great time at the movies and stay on the edge of your seat as you're engulfed in an intense adventure, definitely see this film. It's one you're going to want to experience on the big screen.",I Am Number Four

130,emphedokles,Do they use story text generators for such movies ?,2,17 December 2011,"Who the hell is writing such totally meaningless and illogical stories. And how is it possible, that anyone pays a dollar to produces such flicks?You need five minutes to watch, to realize that this is ""Just another teen superpower crap"". After 10 minutes you get aware that you will watch nothing else, then a mixture of common scenes that you have seen 100 times before.The movie does not even have a story. Its only a alien beach boy with superpowers, fleeing from ugly bad aliens. Sorry for that spoiler. That was the whole story. You will not learn anything about why he is on earth or why he has that superpowers. And how in gods name he was able to grow up even if he does everything to get caught every five minutes. But there is still hope that he is getting killed in the next movie, before he is able to reproduce and spread his genome. And here is why.He is hunted by evil aliens which want to kill him. They are using *Yaaaawn* the internet to get him by detecting uploaded photos of him. * Well there is nearby no one in that movie, who he does not allow to make a mug shot of him. Every freaking two minutes.* Using a mobile phone seems to be totally not risky, if hunted by high tech aliens.* Telling every one who asks that he is an alien with superpowers is no problem.* Using super powers in public also. Even if your superpowers let you glow like a Christmas tree* If you hunted by evil aliens which already directly behind you, go with the girl you met two days before into your school and start an one hour session of developing your photo negatives. There is no scene which is not meaningless and illogic in this movie.And by the way. Its a teen movie so you migth expect: * A blond bimbo which he falls in love with for no special reason. * A tough girl with guns who is totally cool and much more hard boiled then any men around her. * A nerd who got bullied by football guys and is protected by the protagonist* A bad guy which father is the sheriff of the town * Bad foster parentsYes they are all there.

131,prateak09,Boring besides the last 20 minutes...,5,9 May 2011,"Of course, ""I Am Number Four"" is by no means a great movie. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of 90 minutes. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful, why can't they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I've never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence. But however, This is not a bad film. It's just not that great. Among the good points, the visuals were astounding. The final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.The main problem is the movie is totally clichéd. I mean how many times are we going to see the exact same story. I mean this was your typical teen drama.new kid..shady past weird and wants to stay to himself, but there's always some cute chick who he risks everything for. There's always bullies who hate that he's got the attention of the cute chick, so they always end up having a conflict. I mean 90% of this movie was your typical high school drama teen movie. And the ""discovering"" of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman. I will say I was interested and intrigued when the film was attempting to do something with the plot and overarching story, but these moments are never given the chance to fully develop.This Twilight series' formula might cheer up the hearts of teenage girls, but males with an ounce of testosterone will grow increasingly restless as they await the arrival of the action that the film's trailer promised. I was intrigued from the early moments in the film where it started to set the plot into motion, and the need for John and Henri to keep running to avoid death. But then it suddenly shifts from a science fiction tale to a romantic love story, and totally loses anything it has going for it. A last minute save in the final act of the film where it shifts back into the realm of sci-fi in the form of a machina known as Number Six (Teresa Palmer) who proceeds to kick a satisfying amount of rampage against the backdrop of CGI and special-effects, is not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst.Acting wise, Alex Pettyfer is just plain with no expression but of course teenage girls will love him for his looks and physique. Dianna Agron is pretty and acts fine. Teresa Palmer who I adored in The Sorcerer's Apprentice looks great but barely gets enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue. Kevin Durand as the Mogadorian Commander is good in his evil act. But one of the film's biggest disappointed is the misuse of Timothy Olyphant as Henri. The film criminally under-uses Olyphant, the only actor who actually acts in the entire film, and makes him into an almost useless background character. We're told that he's a Lorien warrior, and as such you'd expect him to join in the butt- kickery. Unfortunately, he's only involved in one fight and is inexplicably kidnapped. His role is more of a babysitter for Number Four than a warrior/guardian who dispenses valuable training and wisdom. And then there's the relative newcomer Callan McAuliffe stuck in the cliché- ridden role as the know-it-all geek of a best friend though he's fine in whatever he has.All this said, though this movie isn't the best action film of the year, its still worth a watch for the CGI and the last act of the movie. This is the first installment of the probable trilogy or more. So let's just hope they do it right in the sequels. I rate it 5.5 out out 10.",I Am Number Four
132,warrenf_peace,"*May Contain Spoilers* - Predictable, yet disjointed",3,22 October 2011,"When I read the review, it sounded like a cool movie idea. How wrong was I this time (and I can usually pick a good film, like 'Battle: Los Angeles"", (which was really good, BTW). Anyway, after an intro/teaser that was darkly lit and hard to make sense of, they switch production style and go with a sunny ""90210-like"" FOX-style tween-between (the title protagonist, John ""#4 "" Smith (Alex Pettyfer), who looks like a 27 y.o. going to high school - that was just bad casting/writing!

Next, the post-punk Mod bad guys (dressed in black leather - what else? - with 'Xander-Zone Triple X' head logo tattoos, these retards were scary because I'd be more afraid of their bad breath than the Hot-rodded Super Soakers they were packin'! Anyway, after scene after scene of witless dialogue and predictable behavior, like Number Four's 'Guardian' (played by Timothy Oilyphant, who I generally like, but who reminds me of Transformers Josh Duhamel,, but I digress), and as the climax approaches, it's just a big shoot out. Guys get the girls, and too bad Rodney Dangerfield wasn't there to shout ""Hey, we're all gonna get laid!"" When the durn DVD came out before the very end (I hit the ""open"" button instead of ""rewind"" - my damn remote broke, so it's a pain getting up every time to...), well, I didn't bother to watch the last 5- 10 minutes, but at that point, I don't think it mattered.

And, considering how bad ""Dark of the moon"" was and that I couldn't stand watching even the first half of it, IAN4 is good.

All of it. In a day. And it was great! A pulp, but a great one. And I saw just how much was missed. The closeness between John and Henry. How isolated John feels before coming to Paradise (he doesn't have a lot of friends in the beginning of the book like he does in the film) and how happy he is that he has a friend in Sam. The love story between Jake and Sarah was very limited. No.6 is completely misrepresented. I could write more, but I will summarize: if you watch it, you'll be OK, cause it is good for killing time. If you decide to or have already read the book - try to separate them in your mind. No movie ever lives up to the book. Especially if it's made by M. Bay.",I Am Number Four

I Am Number Four tells the story of the last remaining aliens from an extinct planet that are being hunted down and killed by the aliens that exterminated it. There are 9 teenage special aliens left and these are the ones that the bad aliens are after. These special aliens also have a guardian who was a warrior on their alien planet whose sole duty is to protect them. Oh, and these special aliens have abilities that range from moving object with their minds, super-human strength, invisibility, etc. Got all that. Because that alone make me have all kinds of questions that never get answered. The film follows, if you can guess, the Number Four alien, played by Alex Pettyfer, and his guardian, played by Timothy Olyphant.We are told that the first three aliens have already been killed and that Four is on the run with his guardian to Paradise, Ohio. There, he predictably gets tired of being told to hide in their house, so he starts to attend the high school, where he befriends the local nerd, falls in love with the star quarterback's ex-girlfriend, and of course fights with the star quarterback and the other jocks, meanwhile he starts to gain his abilities and strengths. All the while this is happening the bad aliens are closing in on them as well as a mysterious blonde girl. This all occurs over about an hour and fifteen minutes which really is a shame, because the last 30 minutes when the bad aliens and Four fight is extremely fun and entertaining. It's one of the better action scenes I've seen in a while, the big problem being it takes way too long for it to reach the screen.There are many problems with the story, but mainly they just leave way too many questions unanswered, and this is mainly because the whole film is set up for a franchise with multiple films. This is also what happens when you adapt a novel into a film, there's always going to be aspects left out, but you have to choose what's essential to the story and not, and the writers chose the wrong things. The cast really isn't anything to talk about, they just look good on screen but are essentially television actors, but it's not totally their fault they're working with that caliber of a script.Some of the good things about the film come mainly from D.J. Caruso. He knows what he's doing when it comes to teenage action movies. This isn't as good as Disturbia (whose success is mainly due to Shia LaBeouf), but he does what he can with the script and the action scenes are where he shines and pulls you out of the coma you've fallen in to. It was also kind of cool to see an action/science fiction film based around the high school scenario even though they missed the mark where others have succeeded, like The Faculty. Lastly, the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.Overall, its not worth the $8 or more you'll have to spend to see it. If you want to sneak in for the last 30 minutes I would highly recommend that or just wait until Blu-Ray/DVD. If you've seen the show Smallville and Jumper it's essentially those 2 put together with a sprinkle of the Twilight movies. Caruso does his best with some very cool and entertaining action scenes but the script is just too bare and full of holes for him to save it. The same goes with the cast, even if they were all very talented actors I'm still not sure it would be a worthwhile movie. With all that being said I would probably go see the sequels because of the last action scene and just to see if some of my questions are answered or just save some money and read the books...",I Am Number Four
140,torchwood949-166-552404,I Am Number Zzzzzz,2,13 December 2011,"Billing it's self as Twilight for males is probably the only recognition this film is going to get. Alex Pettyfer plays John Smith an alien from another world trying to hide from another alien race known as the Mogadorians who have been picking of his kind one by one. That is essentially the plot of the film and the whole journey of that could be shown within a 40 minute television special. What we have though is awkward scenes trying to mimic the Twilight formula. Pettyfer's character moves to a new school and falls for an outcast girl who starts off as a borderline pervert as she photographs the public without them realizing and uploads them onto her website. Not only do we have her but we are introduced into a stereotypical outcast boy who's father filled his head with thought that aliens are real.None of these characters are interesting. The only semi interesting character is Timothy Olyphant's who plays a mentor/guardian to Pettyfer's being. Added with this is a plot, which we've all seen time and time before while also being created more effectively and entertaining. Characters are introduced and then not shown again till the final act and by that point you'd forgotten all about them and lack the ability to even care what happens to them. The film just didn't feel like it had a defining purpose than to merely market people into seeing it by sprinkling essence of Twilight all over it and to be honest, Twilight is more interesting than this.",I Am Number Four

First of all, the main character is a totally unlikable little sissy boy. The actor has no talent at all he has like three facial expression: the ""I am messed up""-look, the ""I am angry""-look and don't forget the ""awww I am totally like a cute puppy, are you girls feeling hawt already?""-look and that's about it. Not just the actor, but the character is unlikable too. He is supposed to be a survivor, a teen from another planet, who is super-duper strong and one of the last of his kind. And does he have a sense of nobleness or class? No. Does he have a sense of danger or urgency? No. When it is established that the same race, which destroyed his home, is out to kill him, does he listen to his mentor's advice and stays home? OF COURSE NOT. He keeps whining, that he needs to blend in and stuff. When an entire group of outer-space assassins are out to kill you, and they already killed almost every single one of your race, don't you have more pressing matters, than go to school and try to be the ""kool"" jet-sky flipping kid?.... For example, like... I don't know...Planning to escape the situation? Train yourself for battle? Plan a revenge? Oh come on, that's not so interesting for teenage girls......They want to see the UFO go to high school and jet-sky, because he is so hawt......So he shall do that...Its pretty bad when the only thing you can think of to do with your main character is blatant fangirl-service. Go ahead little fangirls get offended and rate me down for this, but this is PATHETIC. Oh and if you want to make another crappy ""nerds and jocks and love in high school with odd girl and hawt boy"" its okay, fine by me, BUT don't LIE to me with a trailer like this movie had. The trailer promised an action packed sci-fi movie and 40 minutes into the film I had to listen to god awful dialoge about odd-girls photographing habits and even more awful scenes with odd-girls parents having little family dinners with UFO pretty boy...What the....??? I am sick and tired of these holly-jolly pink teenage love stories, please don't try to force them down on my throat when I am promised to see a movie about aliens fighting for their lives. I could go on about how unimaginative all the aliens (good and bad alike) were, or how this movie had the most awkward dialogue I heard in years, or how stupid it is that after UFO boys little light-show on the beach or in the class-room nobody really cared.

There are some interesting surprises in this film, so just sit through the obvious parts with patience.The supporting characters are particularly strong. The lead,Alex Pettyfer, delivers on the love story portion.",I Am Number Four

It wasn't deep, thought provoking, or extremely original...But, it was very well acted, and I was kept entertained throughout.The Aliens were sufficiently menacing. The action was sparse until the end, but it was well worth the wait.The blonds were hot and the dog was cute. I never got tired the little guy showing up on the screen...and I don't even like dogs.If you're looking for some super original, thought provoking, ground breaking movie with a rock solid plot, you'll be disappointed. But if you like sci-fi, cute blonds, cool dogs and awesome ending action scenes, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy.",I Am Number Four

High School kid with special powers that he is trying to hide while wooing the girl of his dreams and fighting off bullies - everyone forgotten Spiderman already? Poor script, poor acting, unoriginal storyline, just plain boring nonsense. Might appeal to teenage girls who fall for the main protagonist's goofy smile (which is flashed at every possible opportunity) that passes for acting in this film. Olyphant and Pettyfer are very wooden, the enemies uninspired and uninteresting, 'action' sequences contrived. This film offers nothing that has not been seen before and in my opinion seems to draw a lot from other recent movies. How this nonsense ever got made is astonishing. Avoid it unless you are a teenage girl with a Pettyfer crush.",I Am Number Four
152,ekenaudra,surprisingly good,10,5 March 2011,"When I first saw the trailers for ""I am number 4""; I thought it might be some obscure teeny bestselling book made to movie for profit(Twilight, Harry Potter, etc.)The beginning was awesome (first 10 mins my dad leaned over and said ""Hey, this movie is actually really good!"" then the middle got a little boring typical (loner misunderstood boy, meets and falls in love with gorgeous, yet really ""deep"" girl, but oohh noooo he can't get with her... football jock bullies, befriends awkward nerd... blah blah blah... yadda yadda yadda) and then it got REALLY good.The CG was awesome, the plot was good (for the most part), the story progressed well enough (for the most part), and the acting was good... (for the most part)...The only two things I hated about the movie (which really wasn't a deal breaker or anything) was the slow moving cliché riddled ""boy meets girl"" middle of the movie... (but being a girl... it really wasn't all THAT bad *batting eyes w/ dreamy smiley face*) and the 2nd some what annoying thing was the main female actress; maybe it was direction, or perhaps it was a lack of acting experience but she was just empty most of the time... But All-in-all this movie is really good and deserves a chance; my 35 year old husband liked it (for the most part), my 60 year old father was surprised that it was so good. and I would recommend anyone young and old male or female to go see it :)",I Am Number Four
153,Starlitelet,Lacking substance,7,14 May 2011,"The only part that was exciting was near the end (last 30 minutes). The beginning was a total wreck. It was revolving too much around the stereotypical American crowd, like the jocks vs the nerds. Also, must they include the scene at the beach of hot guys and girls? I thought the beginning was pointless. They should have delved more into the history of the protagonist instead. It would have been more interesting to learn about the protagonist's past and his 'world'.Additionally, there wasn't much depth to the movie and no substance to the characters either. I did not understand why they added Dianna Agron, other than the fact that she was an eye candy and Alex's cheesy romantic partner. They didn't even have any chemistry. It felt like Twilight for me. Also, the love triangle between Sarah, John and Mark did not work because it is too redundant. On the other hand, Teresa Palmer's character should have appeared more. There should have been an explanation to her history as well. I felt like there was something missing, like all the scenes felt disjointed. There were some horribly cheesy moments, such as her walking away from explosions without looking. Haha, it reminded me of Andy Samberg's Cool guys don't walk away from explosions music video.Nonetheless, even the action at the end couldn't save the movie completely. The action sequences at the end were really fun, but after it was done, the movie fell flat again. I was transported back to the corny plot line once more, sadly. Like, how in the world did Mark survive from that window crash? How did the dog even survive with so many wounds? How come Mark befriends the protagonist all of a sudden, right away? Despite MANY flaws, it is a watchable movie if you want to have some brainless fun. I was in the mood for some non thinking movie at that time. The last thirty minutes gave it more support, but still not enough to get a great grade. However, I will give props to the ending for making me forget about the horrible Twilight theme. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Twilight books, but the scripts for the movies were dreadful.Acting: 6.5/10 Script: 5/10 or even lower Entertainment: 6.7/10 Overall: 6.5/10 because when I watch movies, entertainment scores more points than the other factors.",I Am Number Four

First half of the movie is more like... talking with almost no action. But I can say for me, that it worked in much better way than in already mention Twilight (I was able to watch first part (ONLY) and I was so bored, especially with for me REALLY UGLY main character...) But I am number four is better, even if it is about ""romance"" (I mean the beginning of the movie) it is made better. Better characters (both genders), sometimes fun and plus from time to time, some great scenes with THE UGLY GUYS! (we are still talking about first half) But... there is HALF TWO! Second part of the movie is absolutely excellent. Because of two things. 1. Ugly guys are perfect (design, masks, the way they talk and kill) They are very similar to those in 30 days of night, so if you like them there, you will like them here. 2. Special effects are superb, great quality of the picture (maybe little better than usually) and plus to these, very good action scenes, with everything you would expect from action sci-fi movie. I was very satisfied with the movie at the end (and I am not a fun of Twilight, I didn't even see second and third part and I don't want to (just saw only every 15th minutes, when my gf was watching) The only problem this movie has... it is A MOVIE! It should have been a pilot for a new series and it would be great! With these effects and these monsters and bad guys, it would by 9.5/10 for the series!

In memory I cannot remember any film in years where the tempo is set so well. The film builds and builds like a crescendo to the final battle – which is incredible.I really am surprised about really negative feedback/reviews on this film. What's not to like. I have now lent the DVD to over twenty people and nobody hasn't enjoyed it. Reviews saying the acting was poor – everyone is believable and consistent.I only hope that the 'Power of Six' (the second book) is made - then the third then the fourth.Respect to everyone involved.,I Am Number Four
159,chrisalsop1213,totally fun popcorn movie,8,1 March 2011,"Hey, we all know that this movie isn't going to win any awards for groundbreaking performances, directing, story etc. (Although the special effects were pretty damn cool!) So with that being said, no one should walk into this movie with any other intention other than to be entertained (and if you do, then maybe you're not qualified to watch movies). And this movie does that pretty damn well. The story is pretty cool (understand it's adapted from a book series) and it had just enough depth to keep the viewer rooted in the movie. It delves into the whole surviving life as a teen thing but not to the point that movies like twilight do (which beats you over the head with it). It's not the focus, the focus is more about being an outsider. pretty simple but that's all you really need. There aren't any real dull moments. Even the romantic scenes aren't too drawn out and they never linger too long. The acting is solid all around. The villain is particularly unique and is played quite well. There are also some genuinely funny scenes. But it's the action scenes where this movie really comes out swinging. Really wicked special effects, coupled with tight editing (almost too tight) and just overall killer action. I found myself smiling and just plain out having fun throughout the entire movie. Maybe I was just in the mood for it. I don't know. But I really dug it. And I usually hate movies like this because of there flat out mediocrity. Now I don't plan on going out and buying this on DVD nor am i going to rave about how amazing and groundbreaking this movie is... but I am number four is a solid entertaining movie that I would for sure check out at a theater or on a lazy afternoon.

I have not read the books but I will check them out one day and one more the end battle is pretty cool and its conclusion with the song choice by civil twilight is perfection.

161,movieguy592,I Am Number Four,6,3 May 2013,"I Am Four is based on the novel by Pittacus Lore. Number Four is from a different planet, along his protector. Number is next on the Mogoadorian's kill list. This film is action packed, that is it's face value, if you take just as that you should be fine and enjoy a good, yet a bit strange action film. The more depth you try and go the more confused the viewer becomes. This is a movie for people who have read the book, otherwise the back story and understanding is scarce and hardly explained. Sarah and John (Diana Agron and Alex Pettyfer) mumble a lot and whisper to each other during their scenes together. It looked like they were playing it as shy awkward people at times, but with their voices. Body language and facial expressions can do wonders when trying to convey shy and awkward, both did a great job with that, but voices must be heard. Sarah was perfectly in a scene in a forest yelling at her ex-boyfriend, but was quiet and it was difficult to hear what she was saying. Continuing, the Mogadorians waste much of the movie hunting Number Four and then the end battle scene with them is long, drawn out and excessive, but somewhat entertaining, becoming increasingly predictable and increasingly weird. Most of it makes sense, but the timing at which it gets weird just wasn't working for me. Again, a two minutes search on the internet about I Am Number Four the Novel gave much more about the back story that I feel is crucial to the story if you want to be up to speed. I have not read the book, but I've heard a lot of fans of the book are upset and feel the film got Lorien powers wrong.

Most importantly, this movie isn't a ""wannabe"" of the Twilight franchise. This movie is entertainment for all viewers that delivers a good story, action, and desire to want more at the end. I was lucky enough to work as an extra in this movie for about 2 weeks and was able to see how this film came together, piece by piece. The visual effects truly make the film enjoyable. Seeing it behind-the-scenes, I couldn't imagine what it would look like. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.The acting was believable and consistent (unlike previous reviews who claim the actors lost steam halfway thru the film). Timothy Olyphant is perhaps the best character in the film, Pettyfer following right after. The best part about this film: the love story within the plot WAS NOT painful/annoying to watch (such as Twilight).This movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters, as the action scenes truly make the experience.

163,saahdrahcir,"Ever See The Movie ""Jumper""?",6,13 March 2011,"Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't bad... it's just it felt very familiar. Know that before you go watch it based on curiosity. The trailers tell you absolutely nothing, all you know by them is that there are a bunch of teens dying and the fourth guy is next. I didn't even realize that they were aliens until I read an online synopsis. But, it sounded cool. I figured it was similar to the trailer for ""Avatar"" and the first ""WALL-E"" trailer in that you had no clue as to what the movie was about. The only difference is that those movies deserve 10 out of 10 stars; this one deserves 6, and I'll tell you why.It's basically ""Jumper"" on acid. Instead of Hayden Christensen, it was a British teen performing an American accent; other stars in the film include nasally Dianna Agron of Fox's ""Glee,"" and Timothy Olyphant who demonstrated by far his worst acting (and I'd expect more after watching ""Justified""!). Also, instead of teleportation, the teens can use a form of telekinesis.What continues to scream unoriginality at it's viewers is that it is based on a novel. This leads me to question which book came first, ""Jumper"" or ""I Am Number Four""? Which influenced which? I think it goes without saying, I am disappointed. D.J. Caruso, what happened!? Have you stopped making great films like ""Eagle Eye"" or ""Disturbia"" (even though the latter was criticized for being too similar to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" you still managed to make a good film!)? Perhaps this is because Steven Spielberg wasn't there to help you. Whatever the case, you helped put to screen something that will at least guarantee money from teens who watch ""Glee"" and The CW.Regardless of what I have said, this is not entirely a bad movie... sure, the end lacked ""umph,"" but it was still worth watching. So if you haven't seen it, watch it on DVD-- rent it, actually. It's a nice movie to watch, but would I pay for a ticket again (or purchase it)? No.So join me. Let's wait for D.J. Caruso's next film, we'll pray that it is at least as good as ""Disturbia"" (because praying for another ""Eagle Eye"" might be pushing it).",I Am Number Four

I read and finished the book about two hours prior to watching I Am Number Four and was so excited to know if they adapted it well. Unfortunately, it wasn't. It came off as rushed, too fast, and confusing. All the past memories of Lorien were left out, many detailed explanations were left out, Henri was a prick, the Magodorians were ugly and humorous... I know they were supposed to be ugly, but it was a weird ugly, not a scary ugly. The cast was pretty good. I thought Henri was the strongest character, but he was such a prick! I hated him so much, but I rather liked what Timothy Olyphant brought to the character; giving him a much tougher edge to him. Alex Pettyfer as John Smith was rather good. He gave the character a nice feel to it, although sometimes I thought he was a little too tough and tall! Sarah was a VERY much nicer character than in the book. She came off as much more natural and the romance wasn't as boring! Sam was a weird character. I imagined him to be much more nerdy, but I liked him, despite his 'annoyingest!'I thought the adaptation was confusing and hard to keep up with. I would've thought it would be much better adapted because it is a pretty straight forward easy book, and the producer, Michael Bay seemed pretty enthusiastic.

I am sure the writers take good money but ... an alien boy with superpowers hunted down by rival evil other aliens on Earth? Come on! You can do better than this! Even Avatar with its cliché story is light years ahead.

And what's with that school teenage love story? If I want to see something like that I could watch an episode from The O.C.

172,guiltron,Mindless fun to be had...but not that great...,6,13 April 2011,"I Am Number 4 is Hollywood's latest start to a new franchise. It is based on a novel by Pittacus Lore (a pseudonym for James Frey and Jobie Hughe), who has another six books planned. The story surrounds John (Number 4), an alien teenager who struggles to keep his true identity secret whilst living on earth. Problems arise when alien enemies begin to kill his kind, beginning with 1, 2 and 3. The film, like the book, is specifically catered to young adults. Clichés abound in this mildly entertaining sci-fi thriller. All characters are right out of every teen film you've ever seen. The bully jocks, the pretty yet quiet love interest, the nerdy kid, and the overly protective father figure are all there to keep young audiences feeling right at home. Alex Pettyfer (Stormbreaker and the upcoming Beastly) definitely has the looks that will have the ladies swooning but his acting still requires some fine tuning. He doesn't bring enough charisma or emotional range to his character. Timothy Olyphant (Hitman, The Crazies, Deadwood) solidly plays John protective father figure but doesn't really have much to do. Dianna Agron (Glee) does a good job playing the love interest and Australia's Teresa Palmer (2:37, The Sorceror's Apprentice) over acts her tough as nails heroine, Number 6. Apart from the formulaic treatment, the film's story unfolds unrealistically and many things go unexplained. The main love story develops overnight, his power's are never really explained, and the 'bad guys' are bad - why? Of course, the fact that they plan on making more of these films means they'll (hopefully) have some explanations ready, but that doesn't make any of it less frustrating. The climax by far has the best parts of the film. The action is exciting and the special effects are quite impressive. The film would have been better with more action and less teen melodrama. Less picky people will probably enjoy this film. It works as simple entertainment and there is some mindless fun to be had.",I Am Number Four
173,samfran94,Easily Four-Gotten,6,22 January 2014,"So, after finishing my college exams on Saturday, this week I've earned myself a little free time before the hard work starts again. Today I finally got around to clearing some space on my Sky+ Planner by deleting some of the movies I had recorded over the Christmas period.Going out on a limb I decided to start with the 2011 movie 'I Am Number Four', recently shown on BBC Two, starring Alex Pettyfer (he of 'Magic Mike' fame, and the teen spy sensation Alex Rider in 'Stormbreaker' for those of my generation).Whilst I wasn't wholly disappointed by the film I will admit that I hope the standard of movies I recorded will gradually rise after this one. The film markets itself as ""teen sci-fi"", I read on IMDb that it wanted to establish itself as a ""Twilight for boys"", which I though was a bit bizarre. Anyway, Pettyfer's titular 'Number Four' is part of a rare species with special powers who are hiding on Earth. He has fled his planet from the treacherous 'Mogadorians' who are wiping his kind out one by one. There are nine of them in total, our hero is number four, they're being hunted in order ... yep, you guessed his number is up!The film's premise, adapted from a novel, is decent and for a relatively modest budget of $50m D.J. Caruso does a decent job with some commendable special effects. I also enjoyed Pettyfer's performance, in what is first starring role as an adult, he shows great potential. He does a good job of playing the archetypal teenager who just wants to fit in, and be allowed a little more freedom from his mentor Henri (Timothy Olyphant).Maybe this is why the film didn't quite 'sizzle' for me because the formula feels a little overused. Young male hero who has lost both his parents, being looked after by an uncle-like mentor figure, trying to prove to the pretty girl he's normal all the while enduring the hazing from the local jocks. Without sounding a little harsh this film is basically Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' in a different context. Another ""mishit"" I felt were the villainous 'Mogadorians'. Considering the power to vanquish the universe rests in their hands, they never really feel threatening, and for me were almost a little ""cartoonish"".The movie isn't all bad though; as I said it showcases Pettyfer's potential, other performances meet what's expected and there are some solid visual effects on display, notably in the last 20 minutes. Another of the movie's highlights is our hero's unlikely friend Sam (Callan McAuliffe) who introduces some comedy in his role as the ""daring sidekick"". But at the same time this is not a movie I would be quick to watch again. I didn't dislike the film but it never really thrilled me either. Instead of keeping me on the edge of my seat, I felt the ending could be sensed prematurely. And though it does leave plenty of doors open for a possible sequel, with three years since its release and no announcements made I doubt one is likely. Also I doubt if I'd be one of those in line to buy a ticket.",I Am Number Four
174,talentedripples,I am Number Four,9,16 March 2011,"I Am Number four is a rather enjoyable flick about a boy who is not quite what he appears to be. No, not a homegrown supernatural but rather one which comes from another Planet. So we knew this pretty much from the get go. The concept of aliens being on Earth is not new to us but does have the nice twist that our Protagonist (and 5 others) are not here to cause mayhem and destruction but to keep their heads down, stay out of trouble and remain low key. The idea of using Earth as a Sanctuary is rather cool. Of course life is never easy especially when you are an alien, struggling to be an alien and a human simultaneously. The bad guys, (who are inevitable), of course don't look human to ensure a lack of sympathy from the audience and clear cut knowledge of who exactly is who. Oh yes, non human looking dude = alien and definitely evil. Right. Got it. So points for remaining clear. Over all the plot is quite good. As I said it's not aliens taking over the world (at least that's not the focus but when it comes to aliens you never do know their intentions, especially the bad ones). However it is a little generic. The bad guys want the good guy and then it'll be the humans turn to shiver and shake. Bad guys are a real pain who always manage to catch up with the good guy in the end. Another plot bore is the romantic love story, while fluffy and cute feels clichéd and stressed. It's a classic tale of love at first sight with mutual feelings and a jealous ex- boyfriend who acts like a pathetic child and could really use a wake up call. Our Protagonist just suddenly decides Lady A is the girl for him and that's it. He doesn't heed warnings or think...hmm...what if she decides she doesn't like me somewhere down the line? What if I get her killed because she's getting too close and the baddies find out? No thought for the safety of the loved one, as per. Life's not without drama. Wouldn't be fun if she was safe now, would it?The special effects are awesome. The alien deaths are rather cool. {{SPOILER HERE}} Loving the addition of Timothy Olyphant but hating his death, though heroic and rather beautiful (after he's died, not the dying part).Annoyance over the fact our Protagonist's life is at stake which he can't quite seem to grasp, or care about because he's always getting himself photographed or videoed. Also our protagonist actor doesn't make me feel like he really means his love for his beau, or that he's too cut up about anything which happens to him. He does, however, get childishly angry pretty easily.Kudos for the butt kicking female, who rocks.",I Am Number Four

Sarah and john also fall in love a little to easy in the film but I think when she finds out hes an alien the film is better than the book because it's a bit more believable.I really want them to make another film because I want to see what happens and it not just for one audience it for the whole family boys, girls, men and women. I have seen Twilight and I love those films but I think this is not like twilight not as much romance and twilight is only for teenagers and women whereas this is for everyone.",I Am Number Four
176,ANightToRemember,Poor adaptation which lacks imagination and heart...,5,12 January 2012,"Let me just say the first thing. I've finished the book as of last night and watched the film today. And let us sum it up quickly before I go into detail. Never since Percy Jackson have I been so frustrated and disappointed with an adaptation, one that shouldn't have been such a cliché, amateurish film to begin with. So let's start with the plot: John is an alien from the planet Lorien. Him and his ""father"", Henri have come here after their planet was destroyed. Along with John, nine other children were able to get off the planet with their guide/mentor (aka their own Henri), and the planet was destroyed by the Mogadorians, a hostile alien race with little remorse, sympathy, or anything redeemable. They use up all resources (including that of their own planet) to advance their society. The Lorien race, however, has a race which have abilities to do other things in battle, such as control the elements, telekinesis, speed, etc. The Mogadorians plan to colonize Earth next, yet with the Nine who got away on Earth it is impossible, as they have the chance to defeat them. So, one by one, they have to kill the survivors, who have to be killed in order of a ""number"" they were given back on Lorien. They have a kind of protection unless they are killed in order. John blends in with Earth while also learning about himself, his abilities, friendship, the works as the ""invasion"" begins. Simple enough, nothing complicated, right?Nope. In this movie, we're given little to no explanation other than characters shouting exposition at each other in order to advance the plot. By doing this we miss information that honestly could be useful to the viewer to, you know, understand what the hell they are watching.Let's start with the script. It includes classic lines, such as: ""It's not you, it's me!"" ""I can't stop thinking about you.""Let us talk about characterization for a moment, too. I get that there is ONE alien in the movie, yet NO ONE in this movie acts seemingly human. They say things that sound like high school English papers (similes, metaphors, etc.), don't react like a, well, human would in most cases, and chances we have to develop characters are just wasted and burned right in front of your eyes. It's actually depressing to watch at times.Alex Pettyfer. Yes, he's attractive. He's hot, actually. He's tall, muscular, confident looking, everything someone likes to look at when you're people watching at the mall. But this is the problem. I can't take the situations seriously. There isn't any way that someone who looks like Pettyfer would be an outcast, would be picked on, have few friends, etc. In some scenes, he attempts to look insecure, in hiding. No. He looks stupid. Especially since he's got perfect hair, teeth, and looks. Henri is annoying as hell. All he does is complain. For a ""mentor"" he does a terrible job at it. Annoying. Annoying. Annoying. Seriously, I found little reason to care about whatever happened to him. Sometimes it felt like the actor just wondered on set after four days of confusion and played the character. I'm not even joking. Watch it with that in mind.Sarah (played by Dianna Argon, of Glee) actually has some things going for her that are, once again, washed away. She's a stupid Bella Swan like girl in this, without much depth or even any kind of interesting aspect. She just takes pictures of everything. Why? We don't know. And she falls in love with John after like, two days. She even invites him to dinner after he watches her in a store and follows her down the street. But it's cute to her, she's so kind.Everything feels scripted. Nothing feels natural. Only one thing does. Jake Abel, who plays Mark. Out of everyone, EVERYONE, he's the only character who is played with some depth and natural feeling to him. Abel was perfectly cast in this, similar as he was in Percy Jackson (another terribly directed fantasy flick where he just seemed... oddly great, even given crappy scripts).There isn't any mystery to this. We know what the Mogadorians look like in a few minutes. We know the dog is something special. We know Sarah and John are going to get together. They don't let us play with imagination. Any interesting plot lines are just taken off quickly. One scene in particular: John begins his legacies (some kind of alien puberty), and Henri tells him he needs to control it! ...like he does two seconds later. So, no, we never get to see him learn and gain control. He's automatically an export, as proved by his ""running through the forest while learning abilities"" scene that looks strangely familiar to Avatar. Speaking of, WHAT is with the back flips the aliens do in this movie? It doesn't look cool - it looks like a stupid waste of time and money. So, in the end, it's just a repeat of Percy Jackson, Eragon, etc. Great source material taken by untalented people, who, as a result, make movies that are forgettable, cliché, bland, and stupid at times. All the time the books are sitting next to you, literally screaming ""WHY CAN'T YOU JUST USE ME?!?!""5/10",I Am Number Four

It is filled with special effects with a nice production value. The girl is gorgeous, and there is even a guy that acts like such a prick that you wish you could punch him yourself. The flick has the perfect combination of action, special effects and romance. If a TV show were to use this amount of special effects in just one season of a sci-fi show they would be able to capture the entire sci-fi/fantasy fan base. It was what people always wanted to see in Heroes but NBC could never deliver. You may be thinking that you'll just wait for this to reach DVD/on demand but you want to see this in theaters for one major reason. So they'll make enough in the box office to make the sequels. The movie doesn't jump through different time lines and is easy to follow and the main character will have you wondering what it would be like to have special powers regardless of your age. As everyone knows though it's not really about how good the movie was, it's about if you would watch it a second time?

I was not expecting more then your standard action flick,I was pleasantly surprised! The effects were very good and believable. But what really got me was the well developed story line and characters. The actors all did a wonderful job of bringing these people to life and making you care about what happens to them. Which I find to be the number one thing missing in most of today's action films. I am Number Four does not fall into that trap at all! Yes it is high action, yes there are spectacular special effects, but far more importantly, you care about these characters, you can relate to them, you leave the theater wanting more. I highly recommend this film and really hope they continue the story!",I Am Number Four
179,indyfreak51,Nothing good happens until the last 30 minutes of the film.,4,15 March 2011,"I have read a bit of the book, and I thought it was a good read but not amazing. And then I found out they were making a movie and it was gonna be directed by DJ Caruso and produced by Michael Bay. I thought, ""Hmmm... sounds cool."" And I saw a trailer for it, and it showcased all these cool action scenes and Alex Pettyfer's character walking like a tough guy. I was so excited to see it, and when I saw it I was so let down by this movie.The movie opens up with Number three getting killed by the Mogadorians in some sort of village in Africa. And then after he gets killed, Number Four (Alex Pettyfer) starts to get a scar on his leg while he is out in the water with this girl that likes him. As soon as the people see the glowing scar, he runs off but someone caught the footage on camera which is shown later on in the movie. As soon as his protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant) finds this out, they move to Paradise, Ohio where Number Four is now known as John Smith, a kid that moved in from Santa Fe, New Mexico. He decides to go to school even though Henri is against his decision to do so because he might draw attention to himself and the Mogadorians come and kill him. So he heads to school where he meets Sara Hart (Dianna Agron), a girl who likes to take pictures of people in her school and post it on her website. He starts to gain feelings for her, but standing in the way is Mark James (Jake Abel) who is a football player that used to date her and he can't let go of her.This movie was very slow in the beginning and didn't pick up until the last 30 minutes of the movie. And it had some cliché stuff that I didn't like. For example, Sam Goode (Callan McAluiffe)is the nerd that believes in aliens and gets picked on for it and has a step dad who is abusive towards him. And the new kid on the block gets a hard time from the jock. But this movie picked up when John has to go rescue Henri from the Mogadorians and the school showdown with John and Number Six (Teresa Palmer). That's where all the action happened in the movie, and I loved it.But with that aside, this movie started off very slow and didn't pick up until the last 30 minutes of the movie. This movie was a let down, and if you get it on itunes when it comes out, program it to go start at the last 30 minutes of the movie. Because that's all that is worth watching. If they make a sequel, I want more action, and less lovey-dovey. But this movie just let me down really bad, that it wasn't even funny.",I Am Number Four
180,mwm-5,on the top ten worst,1,14 April 2011,"Granted that I haven't seen a lot of the teen-age horror movies that this film is undoubtedly part of, but if there are worse films than this out there, I don't want to see them. I went to see it because the title intrigues. If there had been a countdown (witnessing the extinction of numbers 1,2,3) so we might slowly learn the nature of the danger, it would have been conceivably interesting. Unfortunately, we begin right with the title character, a plastic handsome blond Hollywood type who has no charisma and less talent. I laughed aloud more than a few times, and as far as I could discern, no humor was intentional. The only saving grace (if there was one) was Dianna Agron, who made an appealing ingénue -- very pretty, not exceptionally vapid (like the rest of the film) and conceivably talented. This is the kind of movie an actor would leave OFF his resume -- no one would want to admit to being in it. Of course, choices are made by agents, not actors, and to some idiots this appeared to be worth urging their clients to accept roles. I've probably seen worse movies, but as might be understood, I can't remember the titles.

181,MikeCohodes,Twilight but with aliens,5,1 September 2011,"I Am Number 4 tells us the story of an alien boy, John played by Alex Pettyfer, who is the 4th of 9 surviving super-powered children descendants of his race. He has a bodyguard, Henri (Timothy Olyphant), who has to protect him from the other evil alien race that almost completely wiped out their species. The 9 children are hidden all over the planet, and if the bad aliens track them down and kill them in the proper order (1 through 9) then they will become super-powerful or something like that. The first 3 children have been killed by the aliens, so John knows that he is next on their list. After the death of number 3, Henri relocates John to a small town where he falls in love with Glee's Dianna Argon, but his powers are starting to manifest and he's actually putting everyone in the town in danger by being there. Or at least that's what the plot seems to be going for.The film plays like a cross between a teenage love story and an alien story. It's like Twilight, but with aliens instead of vampires. Unfortunately, it's pretty blah as a movie. It is somewhat boring in places, dragging through the typical high school tropes – the jerk jock, the science nerd that befriends the new guy, the pretty girl that is the jock's ex, etc, without adding anything particularly new to the mix. The action sequences are cool though, even if they are chock full of CGI and also have clichés, most notably the slo-mo walk away from an impending explosion. This time though the explosion engulfs a character, revealing that they are in fact fireproof. Apparently this film is based on a book, one that I haven't read, and now that I've seen the movie, I won't waste my time on the book either.",I Am Number Four

Call me a hater but seriously the kid with the swooning hair ain't even in his 20's and he's making a huge deal of how he got popular...ehh but anyways, who am I to say anything? Anyways, this movie was a cut-above the other stupid sci-fi thrillers (most notably Skyline), the acting was OK and the script was good enough. Alex Pettyfer acts as the normal raging hormone teenager who so happens to be the Number Four, working under Timothy Olyphant who is his guardian (notice his hair, Scream 2). An action movie needs to have some sort of romantic spark (especially when people are saying this is like a guy-friendly version of twilight) so I guess Michael Bay chose a girl that doesn't bare all (in a way). I have to say that he chose well, Dianna Agron (GLEE) and Teresa Palmer play the two main girls in the movie. The story can use a hand or two but so far it is what it is and nothing more. 6.7 Its definitely a crowd-pleaser! but if you're looking for high extreme visuals and a powerful sci-fi story with good acting...well, this isn't your cup of tea.

186,occupantroom6277,Only Watch It Once,5,17 July 2011,"Okay. I first saw it in theaters, and we all know the theater produces a much different atmosphere than home sweet home. Evidently, the theater quality feel worked in this film's advantage. Aw, I may be acting a bit cynical. I honestly do believe this is a first-time/one time movie. Maybe that's just because it's very ""same old, same old"". You can only handle so much of a slightly varied cliché. The more I watch this movie (because, yes, it was gifted to me), the more I realize some very irking things. 1) Alex Pettyfer, although attractive and decent as far as his acting goes, just looks a little too old to be a 16-17 year old high school student. Perhaps that's just me being picky, but it was one the FIRST flaws I noticed. 2) It was much too full of cringe-worthy lines and moments that seemed okay at first, but got old quickly. 3) For those seeking a true Sci-fi action, you'll be disappointed (and most likely sickened) with a thick layer of romance... a lot like dust on a potentially interesting picture. And it was almost instantaneous and very teen ""I can't live without her"" true love. And, in turn, felt very forced. 4) Apparently, directors and producers have expected you to have read the book beforehand in order to understand, because there isn't a lot of explanation offered. Confusion is never fun while watching a movie. Many of my friends who hadn't read the book (like I had) complained. 5) Some of the acting just wasn't... eh, adequate. It kind of just comes down to fatal flaws. Alex Pettyfer has a deep voice, but he isn't articulate, and I couldn't really understand what he was saying at times. And, of course, it was his job to narrate... which only added to the confusion. Dianna Agron has the same sort of problem as Kristen Stewart. And that is this: the constant looking down and eye flickering that seems like a twitch... and I think it was intentional. Teresa Palmer's character was reduced to ""that nameless chick, you know, Number 6"" and bad sexual jokes. Callan McAuliffe was WAY too awkward. Sure, he was the nerd, but there was no ""middle emotion"". Just happy, sad, eager, and angry. Timothy Olyphant played his character up a bit too much: too intense and at times whiny. All that being said, this movie had its own elements that set it apart from The Lightning Thief and The Twilight Saga. 1) The humor! Whoa. It actually had funny moments. 2) Most importantly, this is a relatively family-friendly movie. There wasn't sexual content or heavy cursing. Just good old action. 3) The acting was good at times. 4) The special effects were great, as were the action sequences. So, all in all, this was a decent movie. A fun first watch, but more and more annoying and sophomoric the more I watch it. Your kids will like it. Fans of the book... hit and miss, really. Thanks for reading!",I Am Number Four

Nothing much changes following his arrival (or further to his arrival I suppose as the film follows him), and then he is attacked by other aliens who wish to kill him and the 8 others like him (having killed 3 already). Their aim seemingly to conquer the world.Queue a strange ending with the explosions required for a sci-fi drama, but with too many stupid henchmen that you are never scared for the main character.Unfortunately, the ending gets worse with a 'into the sunset' shot strongly hinting at the wish for a sequel.

189,Ratter,"Better than expected, just don't expect much",6,25 August 2013,"The track record for film adaptations of young adult books is pretty abysmal, with only a few actually achieving both a decent representation of the source material and providing an enjoyable experience, therefore you would be quite right to watch 'I Am Number Four' (from the book by Pittacus Lore) with some heavy scepticism about you. But in the end, going in with the distinct notion that I wouldn't enjoy it, actually resulted in the complete opposite. It's not exactly a great movie - far from it - but I actually had fun watching it.As far as the plot goes, it's pretty much as you'd expect. Guy with super powers falls in love when you expect him to, gets in trouble when you expect him to, mentor dies when you expect him to etc. I didn't expect to get blown away by the story but it did the job and it did it well enough. What's more is that there are enough ""witty"" moments to at least make the experience a little more bearable.The acting was pretty mediocre which for a movie like this actually worked in it's favour. Sure Pettyfer is as wooden as ever but it kind of suits the character he's playing (someone not from this world). Olyphant played his role much like with Givens or Bullock, in that he just scowls and grunts his way through the lines (obviously having fun with it) and pretty much steals ever scene he's in. Teresa Palmer also manages to make her highly annoying character watchable thanks to some bad one-liners delivered with her irresistible Australian accent. Plus there's a puppy.The special effects (barring the alien creatures) actually proved surprisingly effective. Most of it is just vibrantly coloured plasma bolts from the various weapons but they did a good job of absorbing you into the action. Even the physically illogical acrobatics that go on were well choreographed and it was hard to tell what was stunt work and what was visual effects.In the end I had fun with the movie, a lot more than I ever expected to. The first half runs slow and the second goes completely off the rails with action only to end rather anti-climatically, but it still manages to be fun if you let it.",I Am Number Four

I first rated this as a 3 but changed it to a 2 around the 1h mark.This movie has it's moments but most of the time it is painful to watch. There aren't enough action scenes to make up for the awkward and boring scenes. By the way, I don't think we ever got a real introduction to Sam. He was some bullied kid and then 'John' suddenly knew his name. Actually, there's a lot we don't really get an explanation for. I sure hope they explained more in the books.Honestly, 'John Smith'? 'We don't want to draw attention to ourselves'? John Smith is the most obvious name to chose, the one that attracts the most attention.Why exactly are two boys only in the hospital for a night after being thrown into trees, through trees and falling to the floor from several feet high? At least one of them should either be paralyzed or dead, let's be honest.Why does he not want to leave? Yes, he has a crush on some girl, but the Monogwhatevers are closer than ever and he's in more danger than ever with the video online. Why? Is logic dead?'You're not my father.' Do they have a book of clichés they try to have in the movie?There are about 45 minutes left and almost nothing has happened. Correction: Pace is finally picking up. Something has happened! Surprise!What exactly is that light coming out of his hands supposed to be? Because right now it just seems like some kind of built in flashlight which is not overly useful compared to the rest of his abilities. Also, does Jake Abel play the unfriendly guy in everything he's in or is that just me?The fight scene is so dark and badly edited I'm not sure what's going on and sometimes can't even distinguish between Henry and the other one.JohN's powers are getting just the a bit too convenient. Why exactly is he suddenly capable of starting a car and why does Henry know that?Says 'you have to find the others' but doesn't explain how. 'I can't do this without you' 'Yes you can'And why do they turn to stone and dust when they die?Why exactly does Sam want to go with him?1h and 17 minutes of movie and I'm wishing for it to end. His crush on Sarah is getting ridiculous.Why does my father like this movie?And now he saves her and runs with her. Why does he take her with him?Why am I suddenly rooting for Jake Abel? Correction: Jake Abel is the saving grace of this movie. Even though he plays a bully.John and Sarah have no chemistry. They've known each other for how long, a few days? It's ridiculous. Number Six is also a saving grace of this movie.Another problem of the movie is that we never really get a limit for John's power. Most other movies have these scenes where the protagonist trains so we know what they can do. We don't get something like this with John which makes the fight scenes confusing. Why can he suddenly give energy to others? Why does he know what to do? Why is Six the one that gets tired and not him?Chimeras do not look like the dog from John looks. Chimeras have three heads. This thing does not have three heads. Though the spawn from hell is cuter than the dog. I hope Jake Abel's still alive. What exactly is the power from Six? What can she do? She doesn't have telekinesis but she is fast but is that the only thing she can do? Explain something, movie.And now the light hands are laser hands. How are they going to cover this stuff up?Honestly, the clichés hurt. No, she's not fireproof. Fireproof is not being hurt by flames. She has some kind of force field.Six and John have more chemistry than John and Sarah do. Why is Jake Abel suddenly getting redemption? Not that I'm complaining but I wasn't expecting it.

I half expected one of his friends to shout ""Radical!"", but then I remembered that this was not made in the mid 1980s. From there it pretty much degenerates into a checklist of crappy movie clichés: Brooding teen trying to fit in even though his power causes him to be different? Check. Generic bullies not realizing who they're messing with and getting their comeuppance? Check. Bad guys using girl to get to main character? Yup.

And the ""discovering"" of his powers was like the alien version of spiderman.I mean it's the same ole same ole....you explore and try to harness your new powers beating up bullies and jumping around where no one can see you until a super strong villain pops up you have to fight in the climax.I mean as far as an overall success the positive things I mentioned originally (great effects, charming characters, impressive action) can for the most part salvage the movie. But if you're a fan of the genre, don't expect anything new. 3 1/2 outta 5 stars...",I Am Number Four
197,HitsMan1307,I Thought This Was Really Good,9,11 May 2011,"I may be against the general public on this one, but I actually thought the movie was really good. The film, itself, could be better but the storyline, the characters and the fighting scenes sets itself up nicely for a sequel.Sure, there were some parts of the movie which you felt needed a bit more depth, but the overall movie didn't suck at all. The intense action sequences were really good; nothing that you wouldn't expect from Michael Bay's involvement.Whether you like this movie or not, it really is down to preference. I absolutely loath Twilight and any other romantically-obsessive movie and this may be similar in some parts, but the outcome is just far better.",I Am Number Four
198,jac87,Mediocre on all counts....except individual performances,4,19 May 2011,"To be fair this movie is better than expected. The screenplay would have done a RomCom proud, but it isn't bad at all. But what lets the movie down is the lack of even a single standout performance. If i had to pick the best then i would say Timothi Olyphant who shelled out a standard fare.The performance of Ms. Agron is quite pathetic. She reminds me of Kristen Stewart. Both only have a small repertoire of reactions and they surely don't do justice to their characters or the work done by the crew. Alex Pettyfer...what i expected, below par. And why is Teresa Palmer talking with a tune?.To sum it off, this is an action flick that you can take your girlfriend to. But both may end up regretting going to it. So i give it 4 stars, to those who didn't show their face on screen.",I Am Number Four

The movie is well presented, its flow is very smooth although at some points I feel that its rhythm accelerates. The characters are very well done, everybody is perfect for their rol, and they really carry on the paper of supernatural race. The fight scenes are excellent, and number 6, the woman, really surprises me to do really good fight scenes. The plot is interesting, not much original, but the entire movie is well done. Everything is nice, and the movie is open for sequels. Hope you see it, it deserves it and you will surely enjoy it. Hope the sequel come soon !",I Am Number Four
200,rpennyw,"Limited story, but entertaining overall",6,7 March 2011,"I had no preconceived notions going into this movie. I had not watched any trailers or read any reviews. I think, because of this lack of expectation, I was able to be genuinely entertained during the majority of this movie.I Am Number Four combines action, sci-fi, and even a little romance, so most movie- goers can find at least something to enjoy. The basic premise is that alien refugees from another planet have fled to earth to escape capture by an evil alien species determined to wipe out life on the planets they travel to. Each of the alien refugees is given a number and a guardian accompanies them to protect them and prepare them to harness their powers and eventually strike out against the other race, bent on the destruction of worlds. The powers are definitely entertaining to watch on the screen.I do have a couple complaints about this film. First, I think a little more back story would have made for a much more entertaining film. I also feel that the main character's development of his powers occurred unrealistically quickly.If you are looking for a quick action fix, but are willing to forgo an in depth story, this is a movie you should check out.",I Am Number Four
201,Pazrock,No were near as bad as some are saying..,7,4 May 2011,"I thought this film was pretty good, nothing ground braking or new but entertaining still.Also leaves the story open for more adventures. Not rubbish and not Excellent, But Good.The Acting is OK and it does keep you wondering about stuff through the film. I guess it was a little predictable in the end thoughThe film builds nicely and had a feel of a real epic film, but then it had a feeling of trying to rush it all in.So I think it leaves a space for other great ideas, it has potential to be a excellent story.",I Am Number Four

The Hunter only hunt based on their numbers. because the 3 others alien before him is already hunted, now Number-Four must escape from Hunters.This was a failed try from D.J. Carusso (I like Eagle Eye , Disturbia is an okay for me). It's just too painful too see teenagers with wooden acting and chemistry-free(hello Alex Pettyfer, Dianna Agron, and Teresa Palmer), and the characters is so forgettable that you don't even care about.

It seems tailor made for the WB and could attract a big youth audience. Bernie would be a favorite. Most of the special effects are not expensive. I especially like the idea of bonding for eternity. What are the most popular themes in movies today? Monsters, aliens, superheroes and love stories.The movie is quite obviously written to set up sequels. Some of the other reviews are accurate about it containing cliché's of the new kid in town variety, but love stories have never run out of steam, especially of the Romeo and Juliet variety. The closest parallel to this I can think of is Smallville, which had a pretty good run, if I recall. Remember, to teenagers, it's all new and fresh. The rest is up to the writers.

The idea of John developing his powers reminds me of the first Spiderman film, the forests remind me of Twilight, also the idea of the mysterious new kid keeping himself to himself, but then falling for a girl and then risking his life reminds me of many films I have seen in the past including Twilight and Prom.The graphics were incredible and the acting wasn't bad, in fact, the acting was pretty good.John's back story and the fact that he can only fall for one girl made the story appealing and in my book a must see movie even if it is clichéd!",I Am Number Four
205,jaxon1107,Two Jews On Film Go In Different Directions With This SciFi Epic,9,16 February 2011,"'I Am Number Four' directed by D. J. Caruso (Disturbia) is a scifi/action/teen-love story based on the best selling novel of the same name.Alex Pettyfer portrays John Smith (Number Four). John is your basic teenage alien from the planet, Lorien. He's being hunted by the super evil Mogadorians. The villanious Mogadorians are eliminating the nine Loriens that are hiding on earth in numerical order.When the film opens, Lorien Number Three, who's been living in Florida, has just been killed. Realizing that he's next, John and his teacher/protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant) exchange their identities for new ones, flee Florida and settle in the small town of Paradise Ohio.So what's an 'alien on the run' to do?...Enter high school of course. This doesn't sit too well with Henri. Henri wants John to keep a low profile while he's waiting for his powers to develop to their full potential. John promises Henri that he'll stay off the radar.Well, that's hard to do when your hands glow like lightbulbs and you can toss around football players and police cars as if they were made of feathers. It also doesn't help. when you fall for a hot chick named Sarah (Dianna Agron) who the star quarterback(Jake Abel) thinks is his property. Things in Paradise get messy very quickly and that's where the fun begins.'I Am Number Four' has romance, action, super bad aliens that look like bikers with piranha teeth and basically everything a teenager could want in a sci/fi movie. Of course, I am not a teenager and I absolutely loved this film. Gave it four bagels out of five.

It gets a 4 because the special effects are very good. The acting wasn't awful but it was very cliché. The plot was awful - just felt like it was made up as they went along, and yet at the same time managed to be predictable somehow.I'd say watch it if there's nothing else on TV, or if you're a teen looking for eye candy. (Sadly I'm getting too old for that). It's a popcorn flick. But you really need to switch your brain off.",I Am Number Four
207,akovac,Scifi Teen Drama with strong an unusually strong dose of surreptitious advertising,6,12 December 2012,"The movie ""I am Number Four"" goes through the motions of so many all-too common clichés seen in a huge number of popular previous teen dramas. It's still fun to watch, thanks to suspense slowly building up and culminating in some pretty well done action sequences in the final parts of the movie. What struck me most, however, was how huge chunks of the movie appeared to be a pretty blatant form of surreptitious or covert advertising, namely for photography and, in particular, for digital photography equipment. Having this as a hobby or passion is made to appear as not just a very desirable and worthwhile pursuit in itself but also something that can make a person happy and somehow special. It is shown as an easy way for even shy people to make contact with new people that may otherwise be difficult to approach and that will always give something to talk about even if one doesn't have much to say otherwise. In fact, it will make one appear so interesting and ""mysterious"" that having this interest is a way to attract ones dream partner... even more so if one invested to get this very special camera by ""Canon"" that Sarah likes so much because ""it's got all those light leaks that make photos come out so interesting"". To show him what she means by this, Sarah can lead ""John"" to her bedside very naturally, in order to show him a photo she's shot with this camera. Shy girl getting the special guy to her bedside is (subliminally, at least) as close to having sex as it gets in this movie that's otherwise too clean for any actual physicality of that sort. Advertisement, even of the regular type, often tries to bypass conscious recognition of the message it tries to implant. The subconscious is addressed directly because it not only understands what's implied but also doesn't critically reflect it but simply believes even the most unrealistic and banal types of suggestion. In that sense, covert advertisement and product placement may work even better that the regular type, provided the target audience doesn't notice the attempt at being manipulated like this. This element of the movie can, probably, easily be missed (or dismissed), but I'd like to encourage anyone who intends to watch this movie (or watch it again) to pay attention to this aspect. You'll probably be surprised at how obvious - and pervasive - it actually is.",I Am Number Four
208,iluvskittles1983,"Pretty good, but could've been better",8,20 February 2011,"The plot and special effects were awesome but I felt that some of the scenes weren't sequenced in correct order and there was so many unanswered questions. For instance, Number Four didn't mention what planet he's from until the end of the movie. That should've been explained in the beginning. Also, he fell in love with the girl too early and he was forced to make a serious decision too soon. There whole relationship felt rushed to me. The bad guys (I know...it sounds corny) had no powers so why were they such a threat? The guy that was used to protect him said that he had no idea what he was capable of. Capable of what? All he did was show that he can move stuff. He really didn't showcase his powers enough to prove that statement true. You know what would've been a nice twist to the story? If the girl or guy from school turned out to be one of the numbers. That would've been awesome.Hopefully part two, if there is one, will bring some justice to the first one..",I Am Number Four
209,zarajasmin1586,Twilight with aliens,3,27 February 2011,"I'll be honest here. I Am Number Four is a yawn. And when I'm not counting minutes till it's over, I'm snickering at the amazingly cheesy lines. Seriously, I haven't watched a movie with lamer lines since the Twilight series.Which was a shame, really, since I was so anticipating this movie because a) Alex Pettyfer was so cute in Stormbreaker and I'd like to see more of him, b) I love Diana Agron, and c) I love a good teen drama/superpower movie. But IANF was such a disappointment in the way that there's nothing believable about the movie AT ALL.So the Mogadorians want to kill the 9 surviving Lorien kids with superpowers (called Legacies). Why? It's not really clear. Ethnic cleansing perhaps? One of the characters explained how the 'Mogs' don't colonize, but decimate instead. So why go to all the trouble of searching for the 9 scattered in all corners of the world? Why not wipe out Earth and be done with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway, right? It didn't help that right when Number Four's number is up (pun intended), he decides he wants to be 'normal' and 'go to school'. And the overprotective guardian said yes. Sure, what's a murderous predator compared to listening to your teenage ward's whining 24/7 right? And what's with Number Four's propensity to constantly ignore (sound, life-saving) advice anyway? Is he trying to get killed? Or is it that it's more interesting to have a character that breaks all the rules since the main character never dies, anyway right? All in all, I'd say the movie's a flop. The characters are either annoying, unmemorable or carbon cutouts of every other movie. The appearance of Number Six makes it slightly more interesting but in the end she's just a blonde version of Megan Fox. The script was painfully shallow and the story's just...meh.",I Am Number Four

I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised! It had great action, a great love story, and great eye candy! The special effects were really cool, the acting was pretty good, and the story line was intriguing, and I don't why everyone said it was cliché. So not the case! I've never seen a movie or read a book like it. I think too many people expect movies to be thought provoking and insightful. Whatever happened to being just entertained? I'm excited for the 2nd book to come out and I really hope that they come out with a 2nd movie!!

In the book the relationship between Henri and John is really good , in the movie it lacks the sense of humor they share.

The story's compelling, the pace is quick, the lead characters are quite likable, the effects are excellent -- I just don't understand how the general critical response to this film has been so negative. (Sometimes I think these folks just have bad days and ""take it out"" on the films... Ya know, they ""fling poo"" and see what sticks.) It may not have passed initial-review muster, but I guarantee you that it'll be recalled quite happily in the future, long after certain critics' voices have been silenced.

VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i read the user reviews, but i think they are going to easy on this flick. they focus more on the relationship of the girl and boy, and mind you, they've known each other all of 15 minutes,but they are deaply in love and sooooooo attached, that they forget to show you anything of any actual value in the movie. i am sure some of the character building means they are aiming for a sequel, but God help us should this happen!!! i will go to great pains to avoid this experience!!!!

And do we really need to suffer through the dramatic ""Oh, I so want to kiss her"" so I am going dramatically string along the unbearable seconds and then brush her hair out of her face. What are you telling her? I think you should spend more time brushing your hair.Anyways, besides that some cool action scenes, 1 or 2 that I can remember.

Pettyfer drifts a bit on the beginning but i think he takes the character when Six appears. And speaking of Six, very well casted.

If your looking for a good weekend movie slouching on the couch eating pizza then this is the business!If your a sci fan such as myself then this is a watchable movie very watchable. I was worried that the relationship between the main character and the photographer would run away with itself and overtake the plot as is seen is so many decent movies ruined by pointless teen relationships.

220,rachelchinb,Disappointed,5,30 March 2015,"The movie was good, the effects were great, the actors also did well but the thing that I don't like about this movie is some parts or should I say, most parts of its story. I was very excited to watch this because my cousin and friends were saying that it's good. When I watched it, I was very disappointed. I think it is obvious why. This movie, according to its genre should be focusing on the action, adventure and sci-fi side. But I think, this movie focused more on the Romance side.The thing that I don't like about this movie is that, it's just like the other typical sci-fi movies. A cliché one. A good movie is when you do not have to shout at the characters for their stupidity but here, I really shouted at the characters almost every minute. Like, come on! He has lost his protector, bad guys are chasing him, police are after him and he still have time to go to that girl's house expecting that the police won't go there? Ugh. And also, they still went to their school just to see those photos. Don't you have any other MORE IMPORTANT stuffs to do other than that? Well, I haven't read the book yet so I don't know how it was really done or how the story really went but really, it's just annoying. That's why I really don't like action movies with leading ladies, because they usually become a burden to the main character's life. Unless, they can fight and help too like number 6. That wouldn't be a pain in the head. Overall, I still like it, but I was still disappointed.",I Am Number Four

He listens, he demands, he is a warrior, and motivatorthe man that lurks in the harbor of desire of kids and great Dads everywhere. Peppered with humor in an rousing original story, it is an action flick & it a good date-movie for the blossoming love story & without gallons of blood.Returning to Alex Pettyfer; Alex has striking movie star good looksthe camera adores him & the director wisely stays with his reactions. In almost every scene, it was tough to take eyes off him, even when joined in scenes by any of the gorgeous females picked to surround him.Alex has matured in acting ability from Tom Brown's Schooldays, age 13 & Alex Rider: Stormbreaker, age 15. Working with great British actors in those, Alex clearly did not squander absorbing advice & learning acting choices from them. Alex Pettyfer has a lithe sense of quiet movement; capably showing fitting emotion through facial expression, body language, & movement.The rest of the cast are well positioned for their roles, and hopefully, subsequent sequels. I AM NUMBER FOUR easily shows up 200-mil-plus effects-laden, plummeting paper weights. Let's hope that Steven Spielberg & Michael Bay stay aboard for a 'next in the series' filmsoonwhile the actors are young enough to continue their roles. 'I Am Number Four' imprints on watchers like the first Star War or Richard Donner's Superman; resonating with audiences on first viewing, & then returning for second & future showings.

The story, I thought they did a decent job with, but if they sticked with parts of the story in the book, it would have been a better film. They could have made the movie longer and added some other details from the book. I mean, in the book, Henri and John can open the chest he hides together. They open it in the book, and Henri lays John down on the table and pulls out a rock like crystal from the chest and it appears as their planet, Lorien, and with that, Henri shows what happened on their planet the day it was invaded by the Mogadoriens, visually.

The cinematography was good, the acting was good, and so on The one problem I had with this movie is that it didn't follow the book at all. If anything I feel like the book was less than a guideline for the director and screenplay writer. If you read the book and then watch this movie you will be disappointed.There were several big things that were changed and that really effected, I think, the entire story. The most concerning issue was Henri's death. In the book he dies in the end protecting 4 (John), but in the movie he dies in the middle after a fight which never should have taken place because it was added to the movie only. 4 also never goes through any training and we know nothing about Lorien at all. So while the movie was good on it's own, it is only connected to the original book by lose strings. If you have not read the book, it's a great movie, watch it. On the other hand, if you have read the book, I suggest you watch it but be aware that they no where near the same. We'll see if they continue the franchise...",I Am Number Four

The casting, the story, the performances, the screenplay. At times the movie gets so bad that its actually funny.The only reason I did not walk out of the theater was the expensive cinema ticket.I appreciate this may upset hardcore fans, but please understand that a bad movie is still bad even if you like it.One can only hope that the producers will show mercy and not try and create a sequel out of this (even though plenty of hints were thrown at us suggesting that the suffering is not over yet).One last thing, the special effects; You can probably see better with a play station 2 or the original x-box. The latest generation definitely has better effects than this picture.",I Am Number Four

Amazing title three are dead i am number four. Although more could have been expected but a sincere try.Story goes like people from other planet has arrived to saves their lives. The are killed by creatures of that planet since first three are killed its time for the lead actor to be dead. With the help of his guardian and number 6 they kill their enemies and lives on planet earth.So considering the new concept and ideology i will rate this as 7 out of 10,I Am Number Four
234,gkintu,Lower your expectation,5,10 April 2011,"The trailer is so promising and any sci-fi/ action fan will have high expectations, unfortunately the movie takes so long to pick up. The first hour or so is like a high school movie. The action at the end tries to compensate for this. The story line was not very well thought out. I mean, who goes to a photo studio to neck in the middle of a potential shoot out with some very mean huge ruthless aliens. The effects in the end are good and the entry of number 6 comes in with some nice action sequences and brings some well needed release of adrenaline. There is promise for a sequel which if well thought out can outdo the first. All in all the movie is watchable if you do not have great expectations.",I Am Number Four

The space punks who want to invade earth are chasing him around the country, trying to murder him and his father. Its good family entertainment. Although it made me physically ill, I managed to finish watching it. The formula is solid for a decent flick but there is something about the choice of actors that disturbs me. I couldn't get past the fact that the ""high school kid"" is a 45 year old actor. I wish I hadn't watched it but I was bored and it was at least good for a good laugh.",I Am Number Four
236,blondien46,Awesome movie!,8,28 May 2011,"This was a entertaining and creative movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously or compared to Twilight. There are some token comparisons that could be made, but Twilight is more of a chick flick whereas I am Number Four is more of an action film. I believe that the cast was strong and the characters are imaginative and funny. In fact, the movie at times makes fun of itself i.e. the bad guys that are trying to hunt down and kill Number Four and others like him. They speak a different language during the film, but then the head guy has to get information from the humans in English, and it turns out he is quite humorous. The ending is left open in a sense but only for a sequel duh. And as far the bully turning nice you could either say he felt what it was like to be bullied and/or the fact that his life was saved.

I didn't really care for the dog so much because I thought it was some evil thing until it suddenly transforms into a monster and saves the day and get seriously hurt in the process. But The dog should have been in at least one battle before it got hurt, because since it didn't I didn't care. The love aspect of the movie was also really confusing due to the fact that at the end it seemed like Sam and that country girl were in love and number four and six were in love, and right after that Number four and country girl kisses.

First of all, John doesn't get to chose his own name, Sam isn't shocked when he finds out that John is an alien. Also, Henri dies right after he's kidnapped, not during the battle at school. Also, John never got to know the use of the box Henri takes everywhere. And John doesn't get trained. But when you look over all the differences with the book the film is very nice. The special effects are very good and the make-up is done amazing. The storyline is understandable for everyone who hasn't read the books, but for the ones who have, it can be confusing.

The plot is a bit thin and there isn't all that much explanation of the conflict between the alien species or what, specifically, the heroes are going to do once they find each other. The ending seems abrupt. Presumably, it's to leave room for a further series but I prefer self-contained movies.The fights are so fast-paced and the camera changes angles so often that I could hardly make out what was happening.

241,bnvrohm,Simply Good Fun,8,5 July 2011,"I was pleasantly surprised when I watched 'I Am Number Four'. I only vaguely remembered the trailer, and picked it on a whim.The characters were understated yet likable. I especially enjoyed Timothy Olyphant's performance. He ensured that the calm and evenhanded protector, Henri, anchored the film early on and led us where we needed to go in the 2nd act. There was good chemistry between Alex Pettyfer & Dianna Agron and Teresa Palmer wowed in the 3rd act.The choreography and special effects were up to industry standards. I thought the 'monsters' were a bit on the cheesy side. Where the effects shined were the Mogadorian weapon vs. the legacy ability fights.Act 1 did its job. It wets the appetite, introduces us to most of the key players and sets the story in motion. Act 2 spent an awful lot of time developing the relationship between John and Sarah. It certainly had a 'Twilight' feel to it. Fortunately they didn't linger in the love canal for too long, but it bordered on distracting. Fortunately, the actors were charismatic enough to where I didn't mind the detour too much. Act 3 is the money maker. Most of the loose ends get wrapped up in a blaze of cgi-saturated glory. Teresa Palmer sold the part of Number 6 when she smacked the bad guys down Buffy The Vampire Slayer style. Honestly, if they were to do a relaunch of Buffy, she would make an amazing slayer. There are one or two loose ends I would have liked to seen tied up, but its clear that they've left room for future movies which I hope and pray there will be more of.OK, so maybe its a bit cliché', who cares? Its good basic story telling. Its well acted, and with just the right amount of CGI. Also, I'm happy to say that I Am Number Four is almost profanity free and doesn't rely on gimmicks like camera shake.

244,ItalianBabe74,Good action flick that will exceed your expectations.,8,22 February 2011,"Having read and loved Pittacus Lore's novel 'I Am Number Four', I went into the cinema with high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the film.It stuck to the structure of the book pretty well, John and Henri translated to screen well and Alex Pettyfer and Timothy Olyphant were both brilliant. Olyphant was the best actor of the bunch, his lines were delivered in a manner that made a whole alien situation quite believable. There are some changes to Sara's character but Diana did a good job too. Some of the dialog was a bit sketchy and teen-cliché in some places however, this is made up for by the surprising humor thrown in. I found myself laughing out loud at the jokes which makes this film even better, adding comedy to the already sci-fi/romance/action/drama elements.The special effects were carried off brilliantly throughout the film, the telekinesis looked great, Number #6's invisibility and in general, the whole superhuman speed/strength of the aliens looked believable and looked fantastic on the big screen. Don't be put off by the hoard of young girls swooning over Alex Pettyfer because although he is the star and performs very well, this movie is so much more than another teen fan-girl flick. I took my parents to see it and they both love it. It has something for everyone - the romance isn't overpowering, the action is mingled with humor, all in all making this a very enjoyable film to see. Highly recommend you go see it in the cinemas!!",I Am Number Four
245,gusnorri-1,So basic it's sad,6,16 February 2011,"I saw this film today.It's so typical, it's frustrating. Visually, it's great - the effects are very well done and especially all the light effects are very well done. However, good visuals do not make a good movie, otherwise i could just as well stare at a laser show with smoke machines for 2 hours.So, we got the main character; John. An alien that looks like a human who keeps moving around because his guardian; Henri has to do everything to protect him, so if so much as a prank call is made to their house they ""HAVE TO PACK THEIR STUFF AND LEAVE!""Henri also got this super duper computer, which he needs to hook up to like 6 screens ( or maybe that's just because it looks cool ) which he can use to automatically scan the internet for pictures of John and delete them.So, John is number 4 of these aliens that escaped from their planet, and there are other aliens, that have ugly tattooed heads and fins on their cheeks ( yes, like fish ) and they have these super duper guns that shoot blood red fireballs.At the beginning of the movie John is about to get it on with a chick when his leg starts lighting up like he jammed a flashlight under his skin, burning a weird circle in it, which indicated that Number 3 had died, so then he's next on the to-kill list and because of all the witnesses ( and the lovely girl he was about to make out with calling him a freak ) he has to move once again with Henri ( but not before deleting all the pictures of him off the internet using his 6 screened computer ! )After arriving in a town called Paradise, Henri doesn't want John to go to school, because it's too dangerous, but John wants to and gets Henri to allow it. His first day at that school was like every friggin' first day of high school in movies - the cool dudes come and welcome him sarcastically - then go on to shove the nerd of the school into a locker, John goes to help him, and of course we find out that this nerd, whose name is Sam, is fascinated with UFO's and claims that his dad was abducted by aliens.Now, John meets a girl named Sarah, which is a passionate photographer, and totally falls in love because ""his species are not like the humans - his species's love lasts a lifetime.""But the main bully ( whose name is Mark ) used to date Sarah, so he does not like John hanging out with her.One day at school John is in class, and all of a sudden, his palms start to light up. He freaks out and runs into the janitor's closet where he sweats like a sumo wrestler, but of course, in 5 minutes Henri has run from their house, like 10 miles away, and found him in the janitor's closet.""YOU ARE GAINING POWERS ! YOU MUST LEARN TO CONTROL THEM!"" Henri says, and so, within 48 hours, John now has full control over these powers.So the bad dudes come, he beats them up - then the most annoying character ever made... ever ""Number Six"" joins him and she tries so pathetically much to be badass that it wound up just being annoying to the ears.Sam's dad was a good guy, abducted by evil aliens, Henri dies, the whole freaking school and the football stadium become the epic final battle's battleground, and the alien planet is safe.Hooray !It's like the writer bought a book called "" 500 movie clichés"" and made it his mission to jam every one of them into this script.It gets 6/10 because of the acting, the effects, the pretty sweet action scenes, the dudes with fins on their cheeks and because it was able to raise a weird rage inside of me when the main bully was shaking up the nerd... I don't know why, but any kind of emotional effect is a success I guess. ( triple rhyme )I don't recommend you paying anything over a dollar to see this film.",I Am Number Four

I thought the acting was good and there were even a few laughs thrown in that really lightened it up. A little cheesy at times but in a humorous way. I think this was a big part of why my husband and I liked it- the cheesy parts made you feel like the movie didn't take itself too seriously.

The acting was, in large part, decent. Nobody is going to win any awards, but they all did a very nice job. I especially enjoyed the performance of John's protector, Tim Olyphant.

The villains are unimpressive, and the intro scene with the jet-ski's will make you wonder how bad this movie is going to be. But then, something cool happens:Timothy Olyphant creates an engrossing character, the main characters get more and more likable as the movie progresses, and the story gets interesting. The action scenes with Number 6 are fast-paced and just plain cool to watch. You only wish that you could see more of her.The movie is largely an origin story, but an entertaining one at that.

If you've seen Twilight then you know the drama, if you've seen Spiderman then you know how he discovers his power, and if you've ever seen a Michael Bay movie the action sequences wont surprise you. I Am Number Four is truly a ridiculous movie with a back story that just makes me laugh. In fact I'm trying really hard not to laugh right now as I summarize it in my head. The heart of the movie is really a teen drama. Though it keeps to the surface of things and never really goes deeper than Mean Girls... or maybe She's All That with Freddie Prince Jr.That being said I was superbly entertained. Maybe because I love bad movies and I busted out laughing every time they said the word ""Margadorians."" But between the big alien assault rifles with big red light-up grenade shells and big red light-up laser guns that make big red fire/light explosions fighting the blue-handed light zapping hero teamed up with the blue- light teleporting flashy thing and her blue defense forcefield light ball there is just too much awesome to describe! But either way there is no denying that I had a good time. Please don't expect anything intriguing, intelligent, dramatic, or thought-provoking. However, if your in the market for a stupid movie with some neat action scenes and the very satisfying conquest of ordinary teenage drama then please sit back and enjoy.

I didn't even know what it was about, just knew it was some sort of action movie. Wow..this movie was just really bad! I'd call it a cookie cutter movie, cause these types of movies are made in batches and all the same and taste bad. Reminds me of Smallville (the TV show about Superman as a teenager) but worse cause it's an actual movie. It's funny, just looking over the credits, the writer and director both worked on ""Smallville"". No real story of origin, no character build up, no explanation of pretty much everything...list goes on. It also reminds me of movies such as ""Spy Kids"" or some other lame PG type movie...because the villains are just over the top ridiculous and clash with the overall attitude/feel of the movie! Someone reviewed this movie in likes to ""Twilight""...I can see the similarities...like a Sweet Valley High meets cartoon aliens. And yes, the enemy aliens in this movie really were the ""nails to the coffin"". The movie wants to be like ""X-Men"" about a young Superman type hero...then you see these ridiculous alien villains and all bets are being refunded. I still don't know what type of power that kid has?! I know he can push things back using his hands that emit blue light...then you find out he can wave those blue lit hands over a car and make the engine start?! Seems someone saw Iron Man and thought ""Let's give our hero those hand lights and give it some inexplicable power to do anything!"" People hoping for a trilogy or a next one where they find the other numbers 7 or more...you people are sad! Although this movie is not considered a ""B movie"" cause it's from a studio, it reminds me of the saying ""Playskool. My first studio movie."" This movie's awfulness falls back to the writing and concept. The actors were fine, but good acting isn't going to save a movie if the writing is straight garbage. If just a few minor tweaks were made to it I think it could have made more money and maybe get a part 2 or trilogy...by doing such things as casting younger kids to fill the roles, releasing the movie as a PG rather than PG-13, adjustments to the script, and renaming the film ""Cody Banks, I am number Four"". For the people who gave this movie better than a 5, you have to take a good look at yourself and ask ""Am I worthy of writing movie reviews?"" The answer is ""No, no you're not.""",I Am Number Four
253,coolguydirk,"Drab, Mundane and Utterly Predictable",4,21 February 2011,"Maybe this movie was not targeted at me. I am a teenager, but I've seen enough good films to be tired of many genre conventions. This is not a movie that gives you anything to think about afterwords. Possibly just some confusion. The entirety of the second act involves almost no buildup or action, and aside from one semi decent scene involving a carnival ride, which ends all too quickly and dissolves into lame teen melodrama. The characters are mostly cardboard cutouts. You have the bully jock, the nerdy girl, the socially awkward hero and the mentor who get's killed off without actually showing any skill or giving up a fight, instead offering some clichéd words of advice along the lines of ""you have to believe in yourself"".Thing finally begin to live up to the trailers in the third act, but by then it's too late to save this movie. The one twist shoved in for mildly good measure (I won't spoil it for the easily amused), was one that I guessed upon the characters first appearance. There are a few interesting action scenes, but these only highlight how lame all the other scenes leading up to it were. The acting is sub-par to decent, but the unnatural CGI stands out in my mind as one of the more glaring issues. The effects look cool, sometimes.

Pettyfer and Arragon's role in this, I though fit the actors really well. They seemed like they could actually be John and Sarah! I can see why this is rated PG-13, though.

The dialogue is witty and sharp too, providing laughs as well. I also have to protest against the allegation that this film is unoriginal and like every other film in this genre. There are some interesting concepts in ""I Am Number Four"" which I can honestly say I haven't seen in other films, nor do I think some of them would work in other films despite how well they are pulled off here.I am definitely eagerly anticipating the sequel and this film should have a solid place on anyone's to-watch list. 4/5.",I Am Number Four

So with Lord of the Rings and Narnia out of the way, and Harry Potter getting over soon, The Lorien Series seemed like the next big thing for me. So, I devoured the book hungrily and eagerly looked forward to the movie.Okay, so we all know that movies based on books are never satisfying. But all the series I have watched before this one were moderately enjoyable at least.But I am number 4??? Ummmm, the whole movie can be described as a hurried up summary of the book. The start is wonderfully promising. But its 2 mins of euphoria followed by 2 hrs of sleepiness. The pace set at the start is not followed up AT ALL.Except for number 4 and Henri the rest of the cast were terrible. Dianna Argon, I LOVE yu in glee. But seriously, what the hell were you mumbling for the entirety of the movie? Yu re Sarah Hart, not Quinn Fabray. I think yu wandered into the wrong set by mistake. And Jake Abel as mark? Omg, he looked more nerdy then sam for gods sakes! Hello! Yu re supposed to ""look"" like a bully!This movie works very well as your run of the mill good versus evil alien story with a unoriginal teenage romance forced in. But the Book wasn't about that at all. The uniqueness of Lorien, the visual beauty of the planet, the epic fight between the peoples, the crystals used for healing and strengthening the legacies and a flash back of Number 4's life on Lorien were not included at all. This movie just seemed like a launch for Alex Pettyfer(Coz I ve sure as hell not heard of him before). Yes, he is super cute and does a decent bit of acting too. See? this movie was made only for the teen girls to ring in the cash registers.What I disliked immensely, was that this movie did not make even a single attempt to salvage the uniqueness of the novel and keep it separate from the myriad alien/fantasy trash out there. Hell, it felt like Twilight. Only there weren't vampires, but aliens. The mogadorians looked like a psycho version of the dementors to me(I think I prefer them to the Mog!)And the incidents happen so quick, that if yu haven't read the book yu are totally lost. I was soo looking forward to watch the re-enactment of the book on the big screen. All I got was a mashed up number of incidents piled in the wrong order. And everything happens in such a hurry, yu think that a crazed man was running behind the director with a Gun pointed to his head screaming "" Finish it up man!""But I will include some positive points- 1. Soundtrack- Loved the music. Some were slipped in the wrong moment. Some were unnecessarily extended till yu nodded off. But the songs itself individually were absolutely beautiful.They should take a lesson from the directors of Twilight on how best to exploit the soundtrack to better a movie!2. Alex Pettyfer- Heart heartbreakingly cute. Hes the only reason I ll watch this movie again (That is, if he doesn't star in the sequels).All said and done, I will definitely continue to follow the series and pray that the next movie is made well.My advice? If u want to see a movie where yu can have a nice long conversation without missing much of the plot (which is what I did) and gawk at Alex Pettyfer for most of the time, then this is the perfect movie for you.

259,chorley3000,"brilliant film, definitely watching it again, want a sequel",9,27 February 2011,"To be honest this is my type of film. Beautiful girl, lots of action,and someone with powers! For the ladies...and some men you will obviously love Alex Pettyfer. And for the guys/glee fans you will love Dianna Agron! Timothy Olyphant was brilliant as ""the dad"" playing his role with his usual strong acting, as was Teresa Palmer for her role, however short, in this film! Reasons why it didn't make it higher is it does have some of the twilight cheese. But as it is a teen movie it is most definitely needed. It does lull in parts but those parts for me are small and the rest of the movie is just brilliant! Now that i have found out they are a series of books... i call shotgun :D Oops forgot to mention the Mangdorians... scary, very very cool, effective THANKS James",I Am Number Four
260,CanadasMovieAngel,Not worth all the hype,6,4 March 2011,"For the amount of publicity this movie has received, it is not worth paying the $8 you worked for. I went on a Tuesday, the cheap night and still left disappointed.Alex Pettyfer may be gorgeous to look at, but is an atrocious actor. His various crying scenes looked, simply put, fake. I am sick of seeing actors/actresses with no acting ability be paid millions of dollars to look pretty. There is lots of pretty people out there. Pettyfer was not the worst thing about this film however. The plot is lacking. If you feel you must read/watch this story, wait for the DVD release or borrow the book.I Am Number Four is centered around John, a 15-year-old alien and his guardian Henri. They are continually on the run from another group of aliens, the Mogadorians, who are hunting down John as well as 8 other teenage aliens from the same planet. The teenagers are protected by a charm, only allowing them to be killed in a set order, 1-8. John is Number Four. All the aliens have a human appearance.In the theatre, there was about 20 people, all young. If you are looking for a more sophisticated and stimulating film, this one is not for you. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time.",I Am Number Four
261,dannywales93,Amazing,7,30 March 2011,This has got to be one of the best films of 2011 so far. The Action scenes are brilliant and the plot development is well done. The acting is Very good. It is nice to see Dianna Agron in a action movie because she is my favourite glee character. Also Alex Pettyfer has grown up so much since storm-breaker. He does a great job as john. I liked number 6 but the her character is rather cocky and i think i would dislike her if she was in it from the start. The CGI is not the best i have seen but what do you expect from a low budget film. People call this film cheesy but what do they expect it is amid and 12 to 18 year olds. But personally o do not think its cheesy. I think this is a must see. ignore the bad reviews and go and see it!,I Am Number Four

I heard of the movie (prior to seeing it) but I didn't really know what it was all about. I just happened to buy a ticket because it was the next flick that was starting, it was on Imax, and I didn't want to wait 45 minutes for another worthwhile movie.5 minutes into the movie i was hooked - and by the time I left the theater I was #4's biggest fan! Great storyline, good acting, and fantastic graphics - who in their right mind wouldn't be entertained? I am very disappointed that they didn't do more advertising for this movie. This movie has ""legs to it,"" and I believe that it would've produced better results if they just would've increased the advertising budget. I will be severely disappointed if they do not do a sequel. I honestly think that it's worth your time, and it gets a huge thumbs up from me.",I Am Number Four

Yet something strange happens to him and with that as a result he is forced to leave at once leaving nothing behind! Seeing the real story behind the boy that was guarded by someone, they had to survive the chase of bad aliens that want him to die.It is a amazing journey of romantic, adventure, exploring, friendship and action that drags you thought out the movie.

264,Poltergeist333,Very good movie,9,4 May 2011,"Snark is certainly the new black. Despite the snarky comments by other reviewers, it is NOWHERE NEAR a Twilight clone. Yes, it has a teen with powers, and it would be impossible to get completely away from the 'teen angst' points of the plot, but they were understated and not melodramatic. A little bit of romance which was part of the plot, but far from the sappy overindulgence of Twilight. Great acting and dialogue. Just enough feel-good to make you smile a couple of times. Good, well developed story. Great FX that was actually part of the story, rather than a story built around the FX (like you see all too often these days). Overall, a very well made sci-fi movie that happens to have teens in it.",I Am Number Four
265,avinashdharan,"Reminds me of Twilight and Super man and other movies, but tries to make up with fast pace and action sequences.",5,15 June 2011,"This movie is about a teen who is always on the run, suddenly discovering his inner potentials. He and his guardian are always on the run because some bag guys are hunting all the them, ""The gifted nine"". Already three down, and he is number four.In the initial part of the movie, he discovers his super powers. The scenes resembled like any other super hero movie, like Super man ,Spider man or Fantastic four. No big difference. The Experiments with his newly gained powers in the wild and typical initial hiccups in controlling the power, these are no different from the age old super hero movies, still , it was interesting. And the movie as overall, reminds me of Twilight, though not as boring like as Twilight. The Small town, the rainy climate, the wilderness , the good old trucks and the nosy sheriff and the human girlfriend - no different from Twilight. And the big lizard creature, I remember seeing similar ones in Underworld and the big bull dog, reminded me of Harry potter.Acting does not have much scope in the movie and the actors have delivered what was required. Alex Pettyfer, with his ruffled hair and toned body, suits the role perfectly. Timothy Olyphant has to be notified for his performance as the guardian ""Henri"". I expected more from the ""Girlfriend"" of the super hero. Dianna Agron could have done much better, the same way Kristen Stewart could have done in Twilight series. The Stunts and special effects are good involving laser guns and super hero powers. And the music exceeds expectations. It adds a lot of strength to the movie. Zac Brown Band feat. AlanJackson should be lauded. There is no big story line as such. Villains chasing till the end, and hero escapes. No big mind-boggling twists or no sudden shocks for the viewers. Only thing that made me curious was about the dog and the girl tracking him. D.J. Caruso, after giving a movie like Disturbia, should have done better. And as per my hunch,they turned out to be good people. After all, hero would need some good guys on his side, right? Lol... This movie is made with the sequels in mind. So, literally nothing significant happens in the whole movie except for Henri's death. At least we will expect the story to unfold interestingly in the upcoming sequels. After being impressed with the cool title ""I am number four"" and after watching an ultra-cool trailer, I was expecting a lot and it was disappointing.

This movie was bad, though, not at all good. I guess the cinematography was good, but that's about it. I actually wanted to cry it was so bad. I wanted to like it, I really did, but I couldn't. The script is not good, the actors are doing what they can with it (though Dianna Agron's acting leaves something to be desired), I don't quite know what's going on with the direction, and the story itself is haphazard at best. The special effects are pretty. I feel like other movies in the same genre have done much better than this one has. A massive letdown.

There was a little swearing (not much) and it might be scary for kids but other than that pretty clean. The only thing that I didn't enjoy about this movie is the bad guys a.k.a. Mogs. They were weird. They really needed better bad guys and better ideas than dogs that turned into monsters (?????). Also, this movie needed more action with Alex pettyfer! The love story felt a tiny bit rushed, but very romantic considering he can only ever fall for one girl.

Trust me, you have seen same movie with slight variations already dozen times before watching this one.

270,Cimerk,Good story poorly executed.,6,6 May 2012,"The idea is phenomenal, however the execution was not.This movie is a chase that leaves the audience at the edge of their seats the whole time wondering when, or if number 4 will die. At the beginning suspense was well executed with a very mysterious intro into the the evil villains. However, as the movie went on the tension gradually got weaker when it was supposed to rise!A key weakness was some of the little things that were added in the movie to try and raise suspense or for comical purposes. An example is the beasts in the truck. The evil alien went shopping to get some turkey for ""it"", and just ruined the mysterious reputation they had created in the beginning.Overall it was a decent movie with a good beginning, and a decent ending that clearly leads onto a sequel. However due to the lack of effort that went into the movie the suspense goes down the drain very quickly and makes it boring.",I Am Number Four

The secondary characters are equally strong and ""Number Six"" could have ""stolen"" the movie if she would have been given more screen time.The storyline has some wholes, but it isn't meant to be philosophical sci-fi, rather action/adventure.I highly recommend this film to any age looking for edge-of-your-seat entertainment...Finally, it is disappointing to hear that the sequel based on the second book has been doomed (or at best shelved) due to lack of profits from the first venture.",I Am Number Four

Perhaps it's getting a little tired, but as long as we keep going to see them, they will keep making them.Let's face it, if you're going to see this movie, you're not expecting a fine cinematic piece. You're expecting cool special effects, attractive people, and enough of a story line to hold them together.When I first found out about the movie I was really expecting a carbon copy of Jumper or Push--both of which had huge plot holes. My expectations were really, really low with Number 4. With that caveat, I am happy to say the movie was not horrible. The acting was par, the special effects were adequate, and the plot holes were minimal—high praise for a movie of this genre.There were a few frustrations--many of the scenes with the special effects were too dark to see. This is an old trick in movies to hide obvious CGI, but in the 21st century, technology should have come far enough that they could have made those scenes more visible. Secondly, if you've read the book, the directors/editors did take some liberties with the story line (notably never explaining the box or John missing one of his powers). These edits were probably smart choices since time would not have allowed those being developed and/or would have cut out something a lot more important. Thirdly, the pace of the movie did seem to slow around the 1 hour mark. Several times I looked at my watch thinking, ""shouldn't this be over by now."" Even with those frustrations, seriously, it's NOT HORRIBLE. If you and your standards are braced for the obvious shortcomings of any movie from this vein, then you should be appropriately pleased.",I Am Number Four

Dianna Agron showed she isn't just a one trick pony with her acting in Glee. As Sarah, she was very natural and did well with the little she was given to do. I have to say though the best character was Number Six, she was kick ass and had the best lines in the way of comedy, shame she wasn't in it more.Overall it's worth watching, it wasn't bad but not amazing either.

287,dcarrdsp,Has the Success Appeal of a Smallville-like TV Series,7,10 July 2011,"Based on all the split IMDb reviews, I was expecting this movie to disappoint on many levels similar to ""Jumper"" or, worse, Disney's ""Race to Witch Mountain"". To my surprise, I found this movie much more entertaining than expected and left with a rare desire to see this science fiction blockbuster movie become a long running TV series.Where many struggle with this movie is with the leap of faith required to get past the lack of details providing better explanation of the main characters, the importance of various items, reasons for certain events, and more history on various story lines. However, the suspension of disbelief inherently required of science fiction movies makes the plot holes for this movie more tolerable and even part of the experience.The appeal of this movie is similar to that of a high budget fast paced version of Smallville Season 1 condensed into a nearly 2 hour movie. Perhaps this is due to the screenplay being written by the creators of Smallville. Regardless, if an entire season was allowed to develop this story, I imagine the existing plot holes would be filled in with acceptable explanations. As revealed in the plot summary, this movie follows what appears to be a normal teenage boy, ""John Smith"", who, for reasons later revealed, is in hiding from a deadly group hunting down the few people in the world like him.Although living with a false identity and hiding from a deadly threat, John shares the same coming-of-age challenges as any other teenager in discovering one's identity, first love, and navigating the social dramas of high school. John's story is further complicated as he develops unexpected new found powers of super human strength, as well as, attempting to control bright lights of energy that mysteriously shine out from his hands at random and during the most inconvenient times.Throughout the story, various subplots begin to develop with characters easy for the audience to care about. Obvious subplots include John's love interest, an unlikely new friend who wants to believe his father ""who never returned home"" was abducted by aliens, and the inevitable journey to search for others like John. I won't mention some of the more interesting subplots to avoid revealing too much about the movie. By the end of this special effects, action packed movie, we are left wanting more to explore the various subplots and character development similar to the feeling one may have after completing Smallville Season One. I give this movie 7 out of 10 because it's that much better than the 5.8 rating found with ""Jumper"" and ""Race to Witch Mountain"".",I Am Number Four
288,smithmattew,Why did DreamWorks let Michael Bay Ruin this story?,1,27 August 2020,"I am a huge fan of the Lorien Legacy series and recently finished rereading the series. I remembered disliking the movie when it came out but thought I would give it another chance. I should have spent the 147 minutes doing anything else but watch this movie. Piticicus Lore must be appalled by the fact the movie was clearly written by someone who was only trying to make a blockbuster hit with a hot blond on a Ducati. Thanks Michael Bay for another terrible rendition with as many forced explosions as possible. The screen writer has clearly never even finished ""I am Number Four"" much less the other six plus novels in the series. The most disappointing part was that the entire plot of the series was somehow completely ruined and distorted by one movie. So if made it to the end of this review you should go read the books now they are worth your time.
The rest of this contains spoilers for the whole book series.
Three worst parts of the movie worth writing about.
Not minutes into the movie two dies and turns to ash. This is disrespectful to his legacy because anyone who has finished book 2 knows only vat born turn to ash.
Not 10 minutes into the move Four, who should be the reincarnation of the Loriens' most powerful elder, is passed out on the beach from a new charm scar. Why Dreamworks? Why? He holds the power to down a whole Mog warship alone and you have him passed out on a beach? Sad and unfortunately thats what they did.
Lastly, Six having some dumb version of being fire proof and teleporting. Seriously, now the franchise disrespect Eight and Lumen.

But holy moly I didn't think it was going to be this bad.First off the time line, it was horrible. The movie seemed like the events took place within like two weeks when in the books it was months. The events in the movies such as the Halloween hayride was before most things in the book happened, like dinner at Sarah's house, which was actually on Thanksgiving and they were dating at that time. Also four and Henri seemed as though they hated each other when in the books it was as far opposite as it was in the movie.Confusion among non readers. I can easily see how people who have not read the book can be completely lost. None of fours backstory was in the movie such as why he was on earth, how he got to earth, and why he was being hunted. Or what that wierd looking loric chest was(in the books it is wooden with carvings and also huge with items that four can use to protect himself in battle). But in the movie they didn't say what it was, where it came from, what was in it, or if it had any use. It was just kind of there. They also didn't explain why the mogs were hunting the loric in order.(the charm) or what happened to lorien(it was taken over by the mogs the day 1 through 9 got on a ship to head for earth) or why the mogs were wanting to take over the earth (for more power and resources as Mogadore is in rough shape).Events that were wrong or left out. Some events like the countless days of training or going on walks with bernie Kosar(chimæra or shape-shifting dog) or Sara were just excluded while scenes like the they walk among us and even fours legacy was just wrong. Four never hid his legacies such as telekinesis from henri in the books and Henri didn't leave four in the dark. Once four developed his legacies all of his free time was spend training. It was a major part of the book while it was totally excluded from the movie. Also the movie just didn't mention that fours lumen legacy also eventually made him immune to fire through training with a stone found in his chest. He could also hurl fire balls. With the they walk among us magazine, it was an actual magazine not a web page. Four saw Sam reading the magazine in class one day. Four was also not in the magazine it was the mogs which had info on them destroying a previous planet(lorien) and moving on to earth. This led henri to investigate saying he would be back soon in time for Thanksgiving dinner at Sara's house which led to four gaining telekinesis and he and Sam going to save henri. Also there was no fight scene at the they walk among us magazine headquarters. Four, Sam, and henri all escaped barely going undetected. The fight scene at the school did happen but very differently. Also six can turn invisible and controll the elements not invisible dash and make a forcefield.(Her appearance was way off too) while henri still died in the book he died at the school battle and gave jhon a letter which he reads in the second book after mourning his death. HE DIDNT TURN TO ASH. Only mogs do upon death. Speaking of mogs I don't know what excuse that was for a mog. The way mogs are perceived In the books are very pale almost white figures, with dark eyes, sharp teeth, wearing a trenchcoat and hat. Not a wierd looking human with nose gills and head tattoos. The only reason I gave this movie a one and not a zero was because they got what little was shown of bernie Kosar right and I love bernie ❤❤Why did four look 35 he was 15 at the time?All in all if you want to know what actually happened I would recommend reading the books not watching this lame excuse for a movie adaptation of the book. Because they got so many things wrong. Sorry for the long review.",I Am Number Four
294,bthespoon,Wait...what's going on?,4,4 March 2011,"I Am Number Four is bound to be compared to those other ""teen-tastic"" films out there, such as Twilight and yet to be released Red Riding Hood. However, where Twilight succeeds (although not in the eyes of the critics, but more in the pants of teenage girls) I Am Number Four fails miserably. In its attempt to combine romance, action and the supernatural, it forgot to add a combining element that makes it stick together. Instead of a unified mixture that flows smoothly throughout the film, it literally crashes and explodes at the end. John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) is an alien – the cool kind with superstrength and wicked powers – that is on the run from scary looking Mogadorians. He is number 4 out of the nine alien prodigies who have escaped their dying planet, but now the Mogadorians are killing them off one by one. John is next in line and to escape his fate he is on the run with his mentor and protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant) only to hide out in Paradise, Ohio. The film fails to answer any questions, and only leaves the viewer with more. Why did they leave their planet? Who are the Mogadorians? Who is Sam's dad? Why is he even involved? If they are stronger together why didn't they stick together in the first place?The fact that John's powers are never explained, or not even edited into a cool montage sequence with a fast-paced soundtrack, creates a wall between the film and the audience. Now, the powers are only shiny lights for the viewer to look at and nothing more. The trailer promises a thrilling action flick with lots of CG, as we are used from produced Michael Bay. Instead, the action scenes are placed in dark rooms with the actors wearing full black outfits, reminding us of that awful Clash of the Titans 3D effect, even though I watched this film in 2D. The only entertaining scenes are right at the end when Number six joins in, who seems to have trained a lot more, knows a lot more, and shoots a lot more. Personally, I think this film could have done a lot better if they had called it I Am Number Six.",I Am Number Four
295,ryan-rossman,"A fun, unique and developed science fiction film.",9,22 February 2011,"It's easy to see how this film might be compared to Twilight, but I Am Number Four is also an extremely different film and story. There is a young high school romance, but the balance between romance and the very real, intense action makes for a very unique wild-ride. I don't feel like the movie took any short-cuts in the storytelling either like many blockbuster action films. Both the characters and story felt very developed. And, like some others have said, it is the perfect date movie. Right amount of romance and action. I also never got the feeling that the movie was trying to be something that it wasn't. Early on I knew the film was going to have some teen romance, but it never took away from the mysterious super-natural story that was unfolding. I hope the sequel is made.",I Am Number Four
296,MDSJudicator,Supprisingly Good!,7,8 May 2011,"I think some people are being a bit harsh on this film. Sure the plot isn't exactly epic or ground breaking, or even original...but so what? What is these days? I can't remember the last time I've seen a film which hasn't borrowed or has similarities and parallels to another film or book in some form or other.The plot's pretty basic...people with special powers being hunted down by aliens. I know it sounds like some low budget crap you'd usually find on Syfy channel, but I was actually pleasantly surprised. The action and fight scenes were pretty good as far as sci-fi films go, and while the special effects may not be on the same par as something like Avatar, they were decent enough to get the job done without looking too cheap. The creature designs were great too.Acting and dialogue were fine, nothing Oscar-winning but good enough, bearing in mind I didn't know any of the actors with the exception of Timothy Elephant or whatever the hell his name is.This film is somewhat similar and has certain parallels to 'Push' and 'Jumper', so if you enjoyed either of those, then you may want to check this one out. If you're looking for something with deep meanings, clever witty subtexts, and elaborate twists, then sorry, this film may not be for you. If you just want to kick back and watch people with pretty cool powers kick the snot out of aliens, then give this a try. You may be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",I Am Number Four
297,grandtheftauto22,Could have been much better. (spoilers),5,24 February 2011,"I just saw this for free in Imax (thanks to my friend who works there). I would have to say if i paid money for this I would have been disappointed. The who concept is a good idea, their are supposedly 9 beings from a different planet that have extraordinary powers and are meant to protect their race, too bad their race got attack by Mongolians (not really, the enemy race sounds similar to that though) who are now hunting all 9 of them down. Unfortunately for us we only get to see 2 of the numbers! How exciting right? I know myself and my friends went into the theater expecting to see a nice cast of superheros with unique and cool powers. No, you get to see blonde kid who has force push and heat lamb hands, and hot chick with teleport and force field. You see a glimpse of number 3 in the intro but you don't get to see what he can do, then he is quickly killed off by the Mongolians. Aside from cliché and unoriginal scenes like slow-motion walking with an explosion in the background and typical high school bullies this movie had a lot going for it. Not enough of the plot is explained, you find out the name of the planet the numbers are from at the end but that is about it, nothing is explained on why or how they are on Earth, why the Mongolians are killing everyone, none of the cool creatures are named. Hopefully a sequel comes out and more is explained and we get to see more of the numbers, the ending did have a hint towards a sequel. This was a good idea which just seemed half-a**ed on the production part, acting was good and action/fight scenes were entertaining but it wasn't enough to hold it together. I hope for ""I am number 5"" or ""I am number 4:2"" in the future.",I Am Number Four

Although lots of things from the book are missing, it doesn't mean that the movie doesn't feel complete. The bad guys are a bit of a cliché but that's kind of expected. Timothy O. is great as Henry, I really like this guy. Now I am surprised that Number 6 knows much more about where they came from and what they should do than Number 4. Couldn't Henry share some of his knowledge before he got killed? It's as if Number four is purposefully left in the dark. Is there an explanation for this in the book? And why weren't we told why they should be killed in a particular order. So many things I still want to know.",I Am Number Four

A sort of mix between a coming of age film crossed with hints of ""Starman"" and ""Conan the Barbarian"". The special effects are very well done and keep interest in the story on an even level. The romance is really ""kid stuff"" which when linked to the story and the violence creates a tough call for some parents to make. The music soundtrack is way over the top and tends to drown out many of the actors lines. THe main character,John (Alex Pettyfer) is fairly shallow and I suppose OK for the teenage girls to notice.I found Henri (Timothy Olyphant) to be a more substantial and interesting character considering his limited dialog. Basically a good late teen movie but with little substance and disjointed storyline.",I Am Number Four

The story pulled the audience in and it kept you wanting more of I Am Number Four! The only con is the same as every other movie that is based on a book. The movie was great...until I read the book. The directors and the writers and producers and whoever else, changed the story A LOT! I read the book shortly AFTER I saw the movie and I must say that there were a lot of differences.

I felt the it was just being hyped up and that it would be one of those ""the trailer looks better than the movie"" kind of things. I was wrong, however. This movie was great! There's great character development, which I believe is missing from most movies today. Hollywood tries to crank out these money makers without any thought as to a plot or characters or the things that matter. The special effects are great but not too overdone. Also it wasn't sexed up like al movies seem to be today.Overall this was an all around good movie. I enjoyed it immensely, and I think that if you go into it not expecting it to be an amazing over the edge revolutionary movie, but rather a very well done, family friendly, cool super hero movie you will enjoy it also :]",I Am Number Four

But the movie didn't explain the plot, didn't explain the reason why they couldn't be killed out of order, left out key parts from the book of the back story of lorien and what happened to their homeland. Changed events in the book that would have made the movie better. Movie was decent but read the book, it gives you all the things the movie didn't. the movie contains your teenage love, some funny moments to lighten the mood, action, some suspenseful moments. The beginning can be kind of dull but some times it happens to try and build the movie up.

304,aaron5436,"Entertaining, but MY GOD, it was stupid",4,5 March 2011,"First off, I need to say that I haven't read the books, nor do I know anything about them.So, if you're thinking of seeing this movie, don't go in thinking that it will be groundbreaking, interesting, well written or anything like that. While your watching the movie, just don't think about what your watching and you may enjoy it. Sure, the effects were pretty good and the action was decent, but my god, the story was so unbelievably stupid, not to mention that half of the things that happen in the movie were unexplained. Also, the acting was pretty bad, but that's excusable.So the basic plot is that there are some teenage aliens from another planet that was destroyed, and these 9 teenagers were the only people to survive. Now they're being hunted by some other aliens from the same planet (for reasons that weren't explained, other than that they want to take over the world for some reason). Anyway, the story is pretty clichéd, but that isn't where it gets bad. First of all, the main character can basically use the force, yet he never uses it. At one point he crushes a lamp post by pumping his fist, but he never uses this ability again, except in a tiny fight between him and his watcher, or whatever they are called. He can pick up objects by just pointing at them, but he never uses this power to, say, take the enemy's guns and shoot them.Second, little to nothing is explained. These people have superpowers, but why do they have them? Number 6 can teleport, but it seems that she is the only alien that is able to do so. She's also fireproof, which was fairly convenient when Number 4 and 6 are engulfed in a flame at the end (this was very poorly set up, by the way). I could go through all of the unexplained plot points in the movie, but that would take me hours. All in all, go see this movie if you just want to kill an hour and a half. If you're looking for something interesting, clever or just something that makes sense, stay away from I Am Number Four.",I Am Number Four

Maybe it's the Michael Bay formula that just puts a bad taste in my mouth to begin with but this kid is not Shia LaBeof....someone who is a great actor even if his career has been a little one note thus far. This guy Alex obviously got the role because of a mixture of his looks and some other unknown factor, but it most definitely was not his talent. He tries so desperately to look cool that this James Dean wannabe makes me want to vomit from the moment he appears on screen.

Dianna Agron did particularly well in her role, definitely well executed, stepping outside her well known part as ""Quinn Fabray"" from Glee. Alex Pettyfer, never fails to please one's eyes!

Number Six is totally smoking sexy hot. Good strong female characters. The cast, acting, & special effects reminded me of Disney's Race to Witch Mountain which we also enjoyed. Only Complaints Spoiler Alert: There is a missing scene at the end when a character you thought was dead suddenly appeared alive without any explanation. They leave it open for a sequel which we would love to see. What's up with the jock? is he alive, dead, converted to an evil zombie for the sequel?

310,Pyrogirlx,Just wrong compared to the book. Read the book first.,4,14 August 2011,"I read the book before watching due to the fact I have had trouble with reading after watching films. The books story and action was excellent, it was genuinely a Sci-fi action with a bit of drama and romance chucked in.When I watched the film, the first scene was promising and well done. After that I was deeply disappointed. The story become High school drama and Shakespeare love. They changed the order and the whole layout way too much. They left out so much explanation about Lorien (planet) and they moved the whole Sarah and John thing way to quickly and invaded the whole thing with it. They changed the plot so much it feels like it's not at all related to the book. The action scene's I felt were so wrong and the hay ride scene was completely off. There was just so much depressingly wrong about it that it felt like someone stole the plot and made a mediocre remake.Although the story is off and is turned into rather disappointing cliché teenage romance, the acting and characters make it up somewhat. Okay first John (Alex) was done okay it wasn't how I pictured him to act like, in this he is a little too angry, mean and empty for the character. Next Sarah (Dianna Agron) is perfect, in my opinion they got the girls in the film brilliant and Sarah was perfect all I can say, excellent acting from Dianna. I would like to take the opportunity to say that I found Sarah and Johns relationship really awkward, forced and no chemistry, it also seemed very cliché. Number 6 (Teresa Palmer) is perfect again for some reason when reading the book a pictured someone exactly like her, bad ass Australian with awesome style, also brilliant acting and portrayal. Sam Goode was well done I did kind of expect him to be a bit different but that's just my imagination, I think the guy who plays him did a brilliant job. Mark in my opinion is alright not perfect but is well played. Henri is wear my rant starts, one Henri is supposed to have a french accent and be a lot kinder, this version is very gruff and mean which isn't right. The mogadorians are well done I have to admit they are well played, I however would have liked it if they were more intimidating, I thought they were to much of comedy villains.The effects are well done, cheesy but well done. The way they did Bernie Kosar was great even if it didn't match the plot properly.I do realise that they are putting a creative spin on it but there's a fine line between that and ripping off something. This crossed the line along way. I would watch it again but after reading the book it deeply disappointed me with the horribly tweaked plot and action scene. I didn't cry like I did when I read the book and I didn't feel suspense like I did in the book. And honestly the most entertaining part of the whole thing was Number 6's skill of badassness, Sarah's annoying ability to make you smile when she's on screen and the fact there's bloopers to watch that are hilarious.",I Am Number Four
311,MovieInvestigator,"Some decent action, and some stereotypical teen drama.",5,19 February 2011,"First off, I am a huge Michael Bay fan. The action in 'Transformers' has yet to be topped, and 'The Island' is still an all time favorite. I was excited to see that Michael Bay was at least producing this film, and I was fairly excited after watching the trailer.I also am taken to new films with new or obscure actors because I am looking for more than Russel Crowe or Reese Witherspoon stealing the spotlight.With that said, 'I Am Number Four' had very good blasting action, but it was not frequent enough or innovative enough to hide the poor teen drama and week plot line.If you are looking for another book series hitting main line cinema, then you may have found your perfect flick, but honestly save your green backs and go buy a couple five dollar movies for your collection back at home.The movie wasn't terrible, but it was dry, like eating lots of peanut butter with no water at hand.",I Am Number Four

We actually cared about what happened to them (something that I can't say about other book-to-movie Harry-Potter-wannabes.) Even number Six, a bad-ass female with Nightcrawler-like power was lovable!Finally, the storyline was engaging and easy to understand. Yes, there were some unexplained portions, but this is only the first movie in a series. I understood it just fine without having read the book, and there was no point in the movie where I felt that things were moving too slowly (nor to quickly, for that matter.)I would urge you not to take any of the negative reviews written by middle-aged men to heart - spend the 10 bucks and give this movie a chance.

Nice explosions, exciting fight scenes, and loud noises :] The movie seemed pretty typical. Fairly easy to see what is coming, but fun to watch non-the-less.The majorly disappointing aspect of the movie, which I find in a lot of movies anyway, is it strays a good deal from the book. The book is darker, gives a great deal more character insight, as well as more details into the connection the last reaming Lorics have with their destroyed planet. In the book, John (#4) is able to visit his planet in it's last days (and other childhood memories) in some meditative state as apart of his training.Details are also skewed on the characters abilities. In the book John isn't as developed as he is in the movie, but he does have the ability to resist fire like number 6 does in the movie, and it's almost as if number 6 is a completely different character with different abilities.The Mogadorians are slightly different too. There are scouts and fighters in the book that have this weird way of consuming the light so things seem dark and hidden, and their eyes have a way of pulling you in and revealing pain and fears to you.I know a lot of things that change when a book is turned into a movie are done so that the movie can be entertaining and grasp the audience, but in my opinion the book is great. If the writers would of stuck more closely to the book while writing the script, I believe the movie would of had much more detail, would of been much more interesting, and it would seem like less of a cookie cuter type of flick. There definitely would of been more originality.",I Am Number Four

They really led us on with the previews, I mean if all trailers were to depict their movies with the same accuracy then Justin Beiber's Never say never's trailer would be him going into the future to fight evil space elves and rescue a princess from an evil space elf emperor who only turns out to be him from the future turns into an elf after a horrible science experiment gone wrong.

Even though the movie is slow moving at the beginning, it picks up speed fast and is quite enjoyable action movie. I think the casting is done well, Alex Pettyfer is quite convincing and both Dianna Agron and Teresa Palmer perform as well. Callan McAuliffe and Timothy Olyphant all so add to the movie depth. Unlike the Twilight Franchise, which many people are referring to, this movie made sense without having read the book (I am Number Four by Pittacus Lore).This movie had great visual effects and easy and engaging storyline, a great cast and overall is a great movie to go and see, no matter what you age. If you prefer action over romance or sci-fi over suspense or a supernatural twist, this movie will please all.No matter if you think you've seen movies like this before, I urge everyone to go and give this movie a go.",I Am Number Four

Just stay in the Playboy Mansion with Hef. This movie doesn't know if it wants to be a teen angst movie, an action movie, an SF movie, all of the above, or just a green screen big-budget filler until a good movie comes along. The most endearing character in the movie is the chimera beagle. The only character I cared about was him. The women are beautiful and shallow. The men are handsome and shallow. The script was typed by monkeys. The bad guys all look like Vin Diesel with bad teeth. The disposable supporting characters are meaningless and uninteresting. There are so many cliché characters: The high school bully is the worst; he has a sudden turnaround at the end, but you don't know why. The plot is incoherent and full of holes. I suspect the positive reviews here were planted by studio stooges. If you want to waste a couple of hours, go rent something fun, like From Dusk Till Dawn.

I guess it was supposed to be scary or at least keep you on the edge of your seat, but it was so stupid and cheesy, that everyone laughed. I'm pretty sure that seen was supposed to be anything but funny. The whole movie was so lame, and, the ""bad guys"" were executed so badly that they were just unreal instead of scary, for example they had fake teeth. Really? The lines were also stupid and we got the dialog of a 1970's science fiction movie more than once.You know, the lines ""I'm next."" I guess the only good part about the movie was that the special effects were kind of cool. The story was good too, but the director did a poor job of making it into something that didn't make you fall asleep. I wasted three hours of work to see this movie.

After all in the movie, they have changed the powers, skipped a lot and did not even mention the a small part of the background of number 4. The only things that are similar is the main story line..

This movie is definitely worth seeing in theaters but only because of the action scenes truly make the experience ! This movie isn't the best action film of the year ! The best part about this film: the love story within the plot WAS NOT painful/annoying to watch (such as Twilight)! This movie is entertainment for all viewers that delivers a good story, action, and desire to want more at the end. I was lucky enough to work as an extra in this movie for about 2 weeks and was able to see how this film came together, piece by piece. The visual effects truly make the film enjoyable.

The actors were good, even the animal actor,who did a phenomenal job, by the way. To some it may have been typical, but it was a book before this, and it's just follow the story. A lot of books that are turned into movies are frowned upon by it's readers, because it doesn't stay true to the story. This movie was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Honestly, there hasn't been a TRULY original film in years anyway.This film does well with the action and effects. it doesn't spell out the entire plot for you, which is something i personally enjoy.

330,nick-53-8197,A Superhero film with a Story,8,13 May 2011,"So I very nearly avoided this film due to all the negative comments on this site, and am overwhelmingly disappointed that such widespread negativity of this film nearly caused me to miss out on it.I watch a lot of films. I've never felt the need to comment or rate a film before as generally the consensus on IMDb gets it right and I come away from the film largely agreeing with those who took the time to rate the film but in this instance I have to agree with the minority on here.This was a very good film. It has aspirations to be more than just a formulaic 'superhero finds his powers' film and actually puts some substance behind the reason, the past, the future and everything in between. There is a reason behind every decision made in the telling of the story and every twist and turn justified. For sure there are some plot holes, but suspense of disbelief easily overcomes these.As a fan of most genres of film where creativity is the driving force, and the writers choose to have integrity and tell a story purely 'for the sake' of telling, rather than to fill a gap in the market, I can honestly say that this film stands head and shoulders above all the other attempts over the last few years. Looking at the recommendations that IMDb throws up at the time of looking at this film:- Green Lantern, Battle:Los Angeles, Hulk, Ultraviolet, X-Men, I am astounded that this film rates lower than some of these.This film breaks no boundaries, sets no benchmarks and for sure - creates no new genres in film, but it is a good story, well told, well executed - with some great acting, great FX and great timing. The fight scenes pack punch, the mushy stuff is held at arms length - just enough to justify the story yet not distract, and the characters are likable, believable and never stray too far from the believable.Honestly - 2 hours of enjoyment with little to criticise.Sometimes I wonder if people miss the point of watching a film. Its about escaping from reality for a couple of hours and giving yourself over to the story.I wish I'd ignored the negativity on here and gone to the cinema to see it.Rent it.",I Am Number Four
331,peeeeyton,Good watch - well worth it.,8,21 May 2011,"At the start, you aren't really introduced to the characters very well and it jumps into the story line before you can really feel any emotion with/for the characters. However, once you start to learn more about the characters you begin to become more engaged with the film to the point where you don't want the film to end because you're so intrigued at what may be coming next. However, some scenes are a little repetitive and it's easy to predict what may be coming next. Also, some characters you don't know whether you feel like you should like or dislike them because they are helping the main character at one point then contradicting him the next. The romance which the main character picks up also seems a little forced and fake so when they have to part it doesn't really bother you that they're parting.In conclusion, I believe the film was a good watch and I would recommend anyone to watch it.",I Am Number Four

I said no but my mother and father decided they wanted to see it. (Why people in there 60's want to see it is beyond me) I sat threw it wanting a lap top or something to do. I hated it from start to finish and there was no hot guys in the movie what so ever just a bunch of old men and jail bait to make the movie enjoyable.

However, when you are dealing with a story line that has ""numbered"" the characters, the complete storyline cannot and will not be realized unless there are follow up sequels. I see that they have shelved the sequel for now, and here the audience sits and wait in anticipation to see the completion of the story. I wish writers would never develop characters of this nature if they have not already developed the stories for followup sequels. It is like ending a story in the middle of the plot and never seeing the results. But then again, that is also showing the lack of commitment of the ""Hollywood"" writers.

Not this girl. Anyway, my friend bought it yesterday, we watched it, I loved it, and I watched it again today. And I DO NOT like to repeat movies especially the next day! Alex Pettyfer is like smoking hot in this movie and I believed his performance, Dianna Argon and his romance was very believable (helllooo last kiss before the movie ends, I even felt the lust) The minute Tim Olyphant came on screen I was like really this guy? But I liked him in his role as Henri. And Teresa Palmer was awesome. I've read about 5 of the reviews below me on this page and it inspired me to contribute. One was being very critical about the details and blah blah blah. Number one bro, you aren't a film critic, so stop being all crazy. Number two, I hate a movie that gives you a whole bunch of nonsense details that don't even MATTER. Yeah, we know nothing about his past expect his people were killed by the Mogs who by the way are gross and may not be scary but Jesus they are not pleasing to the eye, and if I saw one of those dudes coming at me with some flying monster I'd be scared as f*ck. Number 3 most movies put out there today are predictable, I can 95% of the time figure out how a movie is going to end 1/2 way through. You shouldn't go into watching a new movie that you know nothing about with these ridiculous expectations about what it should be. The movie was kick-arse, the acting was great, the action scenes were pretty cool and if you watch the bonus features you would FOR SURE be like damn I could never do that, kudos to them. I think they really did a great job. And the dog <3 too cute for words. Too freakin cute for words! Basically I gave it 8/10, it was good, I would of course watch it again.

337,tcreavis,Very Solid!,8,27 May 2011,"Many people will tell you this film was too cliché. I didn't find that the case.No offense to anyone, but you have to remember when reading an online review that some people will always nitpick the worst parts of a film because they didn't hit the play button with faith to begin with. And usually when you watch a film with really low expectations, you're going to do the above. That's why many opinions are unreliable.I watched this film on the spur of the moment, at home, without hearing any opinions on it before hand. Too get to the point, I was a blank slate.Now then, I Am Number Four was excellent. The acting was awesome, in that you could really form a sort-of bond with the characters. The story was very interesting. Trust me, there's a lot more to this film than an awkward but buff teen moving to a new school. In fact it annoys me when people say that. You'll get as much from the plot as you allow. There are a few questions and plot holes, but you have to remember this film was an adaptation of a novel, so there's going to be some difficulty. Plus *crosses fingers* there's a sequel to the book, so maybe we can get another movie to clear up any confusion.On top of the important stuff, there's plenty of action and eye-candy. There are a handful of intense fight scenes, most having you on the edge of your seat. When you have your special effects added to this, you get more awesome than you can comprehend.All and all, it's not a perfect film. If you tend to over analyze your plots, you may not enjoy this one. But if you just sit back and keep an open mind, you'll find I Am Number Four is very enjoyable.",I Am Number Four

339,crazytheclaw,Might contain spoilers,3,2 June 2011,"I watched the movie and wondered, ""did the director read the source material before deciding to make this movie"", after reading the book and watching the movie I have to say it appears he might have skimmed the book, got a few names of characters, maybe some idea of the overall plot but that might be the extent of what he saw. If he did read the whole book then he must have thought the author didn't do a good job writing it because ultimately he threw out most of what the author worked so hard to create. Just a few of many examples I could show (they are minor examples at that)is the name John Smith was not chosen by Henri but by John as they drove away from the Florida Keys, or how about the haunted hay ride was during a Halloween celebration in Paradise not spring, Sam lived with his mother only there was no step-dad. Then how about the Mogs weapons in the book they where fueled by the energy of the planet, turning to ash plant life around them after being charged. Even if I hadn't read the book I still would have been disappointed in this movie, it lacked any depth of the characters, there wasn't any growth in the characters as the movie progressed. I think if the director had stuck closer to the source material it would have been a great movie but like so many other good books that become movies the director decided to forgo the heart and soul of this great book, looking only at how many explosions and CG images he could squeeze into 109 minutes without caring about the overall content of the rest of the film. That has become an issue with many of the BIG BLOCKBUSTER movies, they want to make things blow up or show off the latest thing there computers can do and don't seem to care about anything else, like a good story.",I Am Number Four
340,trash291,"If you see this movie after you read the book, you will be sorely disappointed.",4,28 June 2011,"The move paid very little attention to what actually happened in the book. The opening sequence, where number three is killed did follow the book, up until he was actually killed. There was no ""vision"" where John saw and felt what happened. After that the only thing that stayed true to the book was that the names were the same, they did move from Florida to Ohio and Six did show up to help them escape from the school. That's about it. I don't know what book the producers read, but it wasn't the same one I did. They took an otherwise entertaining, and engaging story and turned it into something that looked like it was put together by a first year film student. Badly.I think the most disappointing part of the movie was how it treated the relation ship between John and Henri. In the book, Henri was the only loving, caring father John knew. The movie treated it like John was some burden on Henri who was nothing more than a reluctant baby sitter.The amount of errors and discrepancies between the book and the movie are too numerous to go into here. A couple of examples being , Six was only 14 when she showed up. She was not fire proof, John was. My advise would be to skip this movie all together and read the book instead. You will enjoy it far more.In my opinion, the movie was a serious disappointment even if you did not read the book first.",I Am Number Four

Everyone else is probably embarrassed by this movie even existing. If this is what the author wrote and published then the published world deserves to fail. this movie is that bad.Forget the flat unrealistic unclever dialog (honestly how many time does the word freak appear the screen play - must be at least a 100.) Forget the stupidity of the plot, forget the bad special effects, forget the ridiculous premise that has been repeated ad nausea. Forget even that every five minutes is just a musical montage of emotion too intense for words and only music to express their complexity. Who ever wrote this must have been a 10 yr old boy whose total world experience must be watching reruns of 90210 and the CW channel. Oh and his parent probably live in an all white neighbor hood and home schooled the moron. What I'm hinting at is Adolf Hitler would have no problems with this movie. Hint? Hint? In fact, This is a movie I would have expected to be made in the early nineties - ON TV: A typical high school where even the black guy looks like a blonde white super model - no wait that is a blonde white supermodel just 'urban'ly dressed - where they all love to party, go water skiing, and hang out in the woods and drink beer. What is this - American graffiti 2000? The main guy is of course is a shy troubled (always troubled!) intensely private young man guarding a secret that he is an alien with super powers. And of course he has a parental guardian warrior of sorts he is rebelling against when he goes thru his own form of puberty and urges trying to control it all. There's of course a pretty girl. There's a bully who is so unrealistic that the geeks would probably make fun of him.By now you should be groaning. Sorry. I'll stop.In the words of Roger Ebert: ""This movie sucks."" In toto.There is not one redeeming feature of this movie.

Thus, only to find out that he is with ""Number Four"" searching only like him, to find the rest of the 5 as 6 is with them. Therefore trusting his son with the same thing that Henri gave to him.

I say they should make this a trilogy, or maybe even a longer series so that the audience could get the whole story. I think the effects in the movie are quite good, but there was one sound-effect that bothered me- the sound that came every time number four shot light from is hands.

If I want to watch something similar to.. Twilight for example..I'll just watch Twilight one more time. It's the same here. I've read the second book from Lorien Legacies, so really ..the biggest problem is the love story in it.Second - I really didn't like the fight between The Good Guys and Mogadorians. It was like... I am watching FoxKids. Rangers & stuff like that. It was unsuccessful.Third - The Cepans. They are dead or dying. All.One more thing is that there are differences between the book and the movie. Well, they can't be the same, but for example..in the movie they are a bit older than in the book. It is not a problem, it is just not the same.I liked the movie, but i also didn't like it. There are some moments that I just couldn't stop watching and some /like the fight scenes/ that were..just badly made.In conclusion - Story, Fight scenes - sucks. Music, Actors - very good.Though that, I am looking forward to ''The power of six''.Victoria",I Am Number Four

I have read all four book by ""Pitticus Lore"" (I am Number Four, The Power of Six, I am Number Four: Lost Files: Six's Legacy, and I am Number Four: Lost Files: Nine's Legacy.) I am a die hard fan and can't wait for the next books release! I have researched and researched the topic and I feel confident I know pretty much everything to know about the series... Anyways if you haven't read the books I would suggest reading them really soon! I am Number Four: Lost Files: Fallen Legacys comes out in July and The Rise of Nine comes out August 21, 2012! I love the books and I think you will too(; The biggest difference in the book and the move is Henri's death. I think John, Number 4, and Six should end up together and have kids to repopulate Loren! Enjoy the books and movie! I know you will(:",I Am Number Four
350,Wellsh-508-232529,My Personal Opinion,10,22 October 2012,"I recently read the book which, until that time, I had no personal knowledge of. After I started reading I became very entertained and then watched the movie. I feel it is safe to say it may be one of my favorite movies of all time. Micheal Bay did an outstanding job putting this film together. I have now watched I Am Number Four over a dozen times and each time I am left in awe. It amazes me how it was not well liked in the ratings and how there are no plans for a sequel. In fact, I am going to stand up and use all my energy to push for one in hope that someone who can fuel my cause may read this and put the next movie into effect. I loved this movie. It would greatly upset me if there was nothing that could be done to prolong the series.",I Am Number Four
351,clange-stl,Should have been straight to video,3,1 September 2011,"I guess I missed the memo that this was a theater release? The first time I saw this I was simply amazed that Timothy Oyphant was in such a horrible straight to DVD movie. He was in Hit-man, Live Free or Die Hard, Justified, etc. I love this guy. He's an awesome actor. But, this movie just seems like a low budget b movie. Strike that; it IS a low budget b movie. And it's not a good one. Starship Troopers is a good b movie on purpose. This story is boring, predictable, or just plain not explained in any way. So this guy's number 4 and crazy aliens are trying to kill him. That's it, really there's nothing else. Maybe I would have liked it more if Olyphant had totally destroyed some attackers, but no, we get some random little girl out of nowhere to end the movie.",I Am Number Four
352,O-neillD,pretty good film,6,21 May 2013,"this film is a mix of good and bad there were lots of twists and turns in the film i thoroughly enjoyed it though as it kept me on my toes and was a great interpretation of how something like this if possible could end up happening (aliens walk among us!!!!!)don't worry though if they are anything like these kids it should be a hell of a time.but one floor in this film is that part way through you see the main characters lips move(and i say main character because I've forgot his name) but no sound comes out and then again near the end of the film it was an enjoyable film apart from when they try to be funny that really killed the film for me and its a shame i was really enjoying it anyways it is a good film and i suggest you watch it!,thanks ps the acting in its a bit shabby but the plot is good",I Am Number Four
353,bjcollins2000,"Overall, not such a great movie",3,29 December 2016,"I have read a few reviews that say this movie is actually pretty decent. However I strongly disagree. Having read the book before the movie, it came as a huge let-down. The movie greatly deviates from major details into book, for example it shows practically no scenes of John/Four's training in his legacies.On the topic of legacies, the creators of this movie have found it to be okay to change and swap swap legacies between the Logic. In the book, John's Lumen (the lights in his hands) also gives him the ability of fire-resistant, however in the movie, this ability is given to Number Six. John's fire-resistance is a vital part of later books, for example, in one of the many omitted training scenes, Henri makes John a mesh and paper suit, doused in gasoline, which he then ignites. The only harm John takes from this, thanks to his Lumen, is breathing in smoke from the ignited suit - absolutely no exterior injuries occur. Also, in later books (**SPOILER ALERT**) John creatively uses his Lumen to conjure fireballs in his hands and toss them at Mogadorians. Without his ability of Fire-resistance, John would not have been able to stand the heat from these fireballs, let alone even the use of his Lumen.Another thing that was harshly omitted was most of the battle that ends the film. While the book goes into great depth and detail about this amazing battle, the film completely disregarded almost all of them, going for a battle between John and Six against 3 Mogadorians. The beasts in the book were also described as gigantic monsters, and I visualized them as similar to Tyrannosaurus-Rexes. The movie, however, depicts them as bird/bat-like creatures, that were comparatively tiny to their gigantic, 20-40 feet tall selves in the book. There are also vicious little beasts that are described as similar to weasels that the Mogadorians use to sniff out John's group.I think that I will end my review here, although there are so many more deviations from the book, especially involving John's human girlfriend, Sarah, and his School life. If you wish to discover these things for yourself, and experience a MUCH better story-line, then I recommend you buy the book. The book series is, in my opinion, amazingly detailed,and the story is deeply complex, delving into the lives of other Loric around the world. There is also quite a few spin-off books delving into the past of other Loric, and filling in the gaps about other events later in the books. Thank you for reading my review, and I hope it was helpful.",I Am Number Four
354,santtos-manaus,Great Movie,10,15 July 2013,"Great movie and great story, it should have a sequel. There's a lot more to be explored from the books. \i still don't know why the producers don't do it. The first movie was not widely published. But now, there are a lot of fans who read the books and would enjoy a new movie exploring lorics universe, the other garde's members and stuff. I really hope that Pittacus Lore and the producers read all the request from fans and think about a sequel as soon as possible. If the fans start to use their legacies, maybe we can be listened. Pittacus thanks for making me to read good stories again.",I Am Number Four
355,rich-481,"Not that good, way worse if you read the book",1,24 December 2018,"The movie seems to jump around a lot with very little character development. Had I not read the book I wouldn't understand why some things happened - like why the football jock is suddenly nice to John at the end. BUT if you have read the book, this is HORRIBLE! They change SOOOOOOO many things!! I understand most of the time they don't follow the book 100% (that can be very hard to do), but this time they barely followed it with a TON of changes - even changing the name of the evil aliens for no reason AND at the making 6 fire resistant when John has that! I kept watching hoping it would get better but it never did. I hope they stop at this movie and don't try to make the other books into a movie. It's a really good book and series. And for those who say you can't make a good movie from a book, look at Pet Cemetery. It's a great book and the movie followed the book so close many of the lines were straight out of the book. And the movie is excellent. So it can be done, it just wasn't even close to being done this time. Not worth watching.",I Am Number Four
356,nokilo,Left me wanting more,8,8 March 2018,Loved the plot the action and the effects. I went looking for part two right after the movie was done. So far no hint of a sequel. Common guys get it together and release the rest of the story. I would buy the set.,I Am Number Four
357,strogers1202,The best film to ever be made!,10,1 July 2014,"This is my favourite film of all time. The director perfectly captures Pittacus Lore's intentions. All special effects are effectively added, especially number 6's disappearing act. As a fan of the book series I was excited to watch the film and the excitement stayed with me throughout the whole film! The casting of each character was obviously well researched and proved to be the correct choices, if even one of these characters was different I don't think it would've worked as well as it did. The sequels to this book are just as good or even better, especially as all the living loric garde are reunited to stop the Mogadorians but with betrayal and danger on the horizon only time will tell whether they survive. As a massive fan of the series ever since the release of the first book I am tremendously excited and looking forward to seeing the final book of the series, 'The Revenge of Seven', to be released later this year and hopefully for the rest of the books to be made into films.",I Am Number Four
358,shadow64-45-497111,Crappy movie,3,4 July 2014,"Absolutely hated it. Mostly different from the plot of the book. Henri dies WAY to early, and not even at the right place. John admits to Sam that hes an alien before they go to the house. John and Sarah are alone on the hayride, but in the books they are with 2 others, Sam and Emily. Emily is not mentioned at all in the movie. John also doesn't save Sarah from the burning house as in the book. To sum it all up, it sucked. I would read the books again, but not watch the movie or any others. There are a lot of differences in the movie that are not in the book, which is just some of the reasons I didn't like the movie. Also, I think that the acting was not very good.",I Am Number Four

360,peter-tomov-sil,"Movie not bad, but not good.",4,16 August 2014,"I decided to first watch the movie and then read the books and compare afterward...So, as many other noted, characters aren't bad, but too shallow. The storyline as well... lots of information missing. I mean, yes, after reading the book I know why number Four and who Henri is, and a lot more, actually.And while I understand, that the movie would have to be at least about one hour longer, I still don't like how much information missing.And what I absolutely hated was John's character. I mean, sure, it's basically very similar to John Connor from Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles, but that's not a good character in that setting. It doesn't fit. And as someone else has noted: It makes no sense. John wasn't kept in the dark. He clearly states, that they have been constantly on the run. And he already has two scars from before the movie storyline, so he is very much aware of the situation. I mean, sure, John's character from the book would be quite difficult to sell nowadays, since for most people, especially teens, it would seem... well... fictional... but was it really necessary to make him into a spoiled irresponsible brat? And the weird transition from a useless kid into a hero is strange and baseless as well. It just doesn't fit.And since the background story is... almost non-existent in the movie, a very important part about the Guardian of Number 6 was totally left out. Not to mention... everything else.All in all... thanks to the chopped off parts a story with a nice potential became just another teen-flick with romance to attract romantic people and fights filled with CGI to attract people who like action, but the story eroded into a huge load of muck... it's somehow sad.But I recommend the book, if you have the time. It's not really a belletry jewel, but it is most definitely a whole lot better than the movie.",I Am Number Four
361,jorgitosalgado1,"I'm Latin American and I think this film ""I Am Number Four"" is very good.",10,13 October 2014,"I am a Latin American, whom he thought the film ""i am number four"" or ""I am number four"" very good, and I think actually that should follow the complete saga in the ""Cinema"" Because I being one of the people who like the film and a film as it is being accommodated to fiction and currently youth makes us feel better seeing them enjoying the ""fiction"". The film in general is very full at the time of seeing it makes you concentrate, if not a little dull or lose the sense of this. I hope you fulfill the dream of many fans of this saga or series. The film ""I am Number Four"" WAS really cool and I'm surprised the whole movie, I make part of Latin America, and being from Colombia I think his movie was a success for many young people and I think if you follow the series here in Latin America you'll be fine. I hope to take my words as good advice ... Thank you",I Am Number Four
362,christinejyap,Cool =),7,4 November 2014,"It is an awesome movie, not to mention I kinda have a thing with sci-fi or whatsoever like this movies. Although at first I was like.. ""why does four have to be such a jerk"" I mean, he's acting all babyish and irritating. But he's pretty cool too. Anyway, what I really loved here is Ms. Number Six. She is just so cool and much better than four like really, she is so strong. I hope she showed up much earlier because she came like nearly at the end when she saved everyone's butts. haha! oh and Sam, Four's friend is a huge help too. plus what happened to four's dog is a bit surprising. So Yeah,anyway overall it is such a nice movie. Definitely going to wait for part two! :) Okay I know my review is mostly for people who have already watched it but okay, here goes for the people who haven't watched it yet. If you loved hunger games, divergent, and stuff like that, I do recommend this for you. plus the characters are really cute! This movie has tons of actions. so yeah enjoy!",I Am Number Four
363,xmarit11,Nothing compared to the book (spoilers),4,16 August 2016,"As loads of people say, the special effects were amazing, and that's why I didn't rate it 1 star, but the film didn't even get close to the quality of the book.I read the book last summer, and was very agitated by it, and just loved everything about it, which kind of made me have pretty high expectations of the film, and it was very disappointing when it didn't turn out as well as the book, like the *spoilers* death of Henri, it was like a huge thing in the book and in the film it was a short scene, and they overall focused more on the love story of John and Sarah and kind of disappointed me a lot.But i understand that it is very hard to meet people's expectations based on the book when they are extremely high, so respect to the makers anyway for even making a film out of it and for making it pretty decent.",I Am Number Four

369,godwitay,"John, a alien with super powers is trying to escape evil bounty hunters and he is next on their list",10,15 February 2017,"This movie has many interesting things in it. I am number four is a great movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The main character, John (Alex Pettyfer) is training with his guardian, Henri (Timothy Olyphant). John is trying to develop his legacies (powers) to one day unite with the other refugee aliens to get back to their home planet. You will enjoy this movie if you have read the book or like action and horror. It also has lots of action and plot twists, there is also a little bit of romance. This movie also has excellent special effects and the director, D.J. Caruso, did a fantastic job bringing this movie together. Some people say they don't like this movie because they can't follow the plot because it is too confusing, but John describes what is happening in the beginning. So if you stop freaking out about the movie being bad, and just watch the movie. If you do not like this movie, you have no imagination and are overthinking everything. So, go watch this movie filled with interesting things now!",I Am Number Four
370,mpmp0,Teenagers and super powers--You know what you are getting into going in...,8,20 February 2011,"and I think I Am Number Four did it pretty well.When this movie finally takes off, it makes up for the first act which, aside from a few quirky characters, is rather predictable.Tho most of the action takes place at night (darkness is apparently very forgiving of CGI and other special effect-driven action), this movie smokes! I'm recommending this to anyone who enjoys super-powered action.Yes, Number Four is the main character and does a great job of kicking up the action (along with his pooch!)--but the sassy, sexy Number Six makes the movie stand out even more and really made the movie for me.Buy your popcorn and soda and settle in for a thrill ride (but don't rush to your seat tho--you've seen most of the first part in other films).",I Am Number Four
