0,SnoopyStyle,Cool aloof hot girl drama,6,6 April 2015,"Isabelle is on a family beach holiday in the south of France. Her father is long gone with his own young family in Italy. She is about to turn 17. She loses her virginity to hunky Felix but it's not as great as she expected. A few months later, she's working as a high class call girl claiming to be 20 year old Lea. Her elderly client Georges dies from a heart attack during sex. She leaves him behind. Later, the police contacts her mother after tracking her down.Marine Vacth is playing a cool aloof hot girl. I'm not sure if she's the next great thing. She doesn't do much more than be that young and confused girl. She is giving a limited acting range. Director and writer François Ozon delivers a paper thin plot. It doesn't give much insight into Isabelle's inner thoughts. There are no simplistic answers. It basically gives no answers. It has a nice cameo at the end but it doesn't use it to full advantage either.",Young & Beautiful
1,Horst_In_Translation,Young and beautiful,6,23 November 2013,"And that description is certainly fitting for lead actress Marine Vacth, even if she was about 5 years older than her character when this film was made. And that certainly doesn't mean that she does not fit the character. On the contrary really. ""Jeune et jolie"" is the newest movie by French director François Ozon, already his 36th directorial effort, which is quite an impressive number for his age regardless of most of his early work consisting of short films, and he also wrote most of his movies, just like this one. It's a mix of seduction, voyeurism, teen angst and just growing up in general.A girl loses her virginity to a boy she met during a travel with her family and that event is one of the early factors that pulled her into the world of prostitution. Back at home and school, she gets asked by a man if she'd be interested in sex and agrees. From that moment on, she does it more often, pretty much every time she can without her family finding out. It turns into an addiction and I never really felt she did it just for the money, more for the feeling of being desired. However, one day, during sex an old married man, has a heart attack and dies. The security cameras at the hotel have her recorded, so quickly afterward disaster unravels. Her mother finds out and the relationship between the two is one of the core elements of the rest of the film. Her step-dad basically doesn't get involved too much. Nonetheless, the one dialog scene near the end is one of the highlights of the movie until the mother steps in. I won't go much into detail here, you just have to see it. Even with the girls' struggles, it may just be a reflection of the troubles the other people in her life have, like her mother having an affair with a friend of the family.The only reason why I'm not giving this more than six stars was the ending. It seemed a bit rushed, the sudden break-up with her boyfriend and the meeting with Rampling's character at the end. Rampling is without a doubt a very talented actress, but to me it felt just to have her included for the sake of it. The dialog between her and the protagonist added nothing to the story and the final scene at the hotel room felt just odd to me and not really realistic or fitting as an ending to this actually good movie. I'm positive we'll see more from Vacth in the next years and she should realistically at least have a career as prestigious as Virginie Ledoyen or Ludovine Sagnier. I wouldn't say ""Jeune & jolie"" was a great showcase for her range yet (certainly not as great as for her looks). She wasn't as quietly devastating as she could have been with her character's actions but possibly this was also the director's intention to make it not over-the-top tragic. I hope for the young actress that one of her next projects will be her great breakthrough if this one doesn't turn out that way.If you're mean you could say this is especially a good watch if you're horny, but, in fact, this film is a lot more. I recommend it and let me finally add that also lovers of French music won't be disappointed. This is often something I'm missing in German or English-language films, but the use of actually sung music is miles ahead in French movies compared to most films from other countries, especially if you love chanson, but also if you love more modern artists.",Young & Beautiful
2,claudio_carvalho,"Once Prostitute, Forever Prostitute",7,20 March 2014,"The French teenager Isabelle (Marine Vacth) is spending summer holiday with her middle-class family in the south of France and decides to lose her virginity with the German teenager Felix (Lucas Prisor). Then she returns to Paris with her mother Sylvie (Géraldine Pailhas), her stepfather Patrick (Frédéric Pierrot) and her younger brother Victor (Fantin Ravat).Then Isabelle works as a call girl using the nickname Lea and meeting old men. She feels affection for her client Georges (Johan Leysen) that is married with a daughter. When Georges dies from a heart attack while having sex with Isabelle in a hotel, she flees but the police investigate and identifies her. The detectives in charge of the investigation disclose to Sylvie that is devastated. Isabelle quits prostitution, but once prostitute, forever prostitute.""Jeune & Jolie"" by François Ozon begins as a coming of age version of ""Belle de Jour"", where the lead character is attracted by money instead of by sexual fantasies. Even the poster recalls the one from Buñuel's masterpiece. Isabelle belongs to a middle-class family and does not have financial needs but despite of that, she is attracted by money. This is clear based on her reaction when her mother takes her money and when she explains to the police detective how she started to prostitute after receiving an offer from a stranger. Further, she is cold and seems to care only to her younger brother and Georges. When she loses her virginity with Felix, it seems to be part of her plan to explore her sexuality to make money. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jovem e Bela"" (""Young and Beautiful"")",Young & Beautiful
3,writers_reign,Young and Ho-hum,5,18 December 2013,"For perhaps the first time I feel justified in my aversion to Ozon. Every film of his I have watched I have failed to enjoy with the possible exception of 8 Women but there the enjoyment was mainly in the high quality - again with the exception of Ludovine Sagnier - of the cast. In fact in most instances it was a particular actor - Valerie Bruni Tedeschi in 5X2, etc) that swayed me to see a given film. With Young and Beautiful - an adjective which is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, personally as a heterosexual male I wouldn't pay THREE euros let alone three hundred to sleep with Marine Vachs - Ozon has made arguably his most vacuous film to date. I can't think of a single reason anyone would care about the protagonist, Isabelle, product of an affluent and settled home who, for reasons that are never explained - indeed Ozon appears to think it is bad form for his audience to even WANT an explanation - becomes a prostitute at age seventeen without seemingly deriving any satisfaction out of either the money - 300 euros a time - or the actual sex. The film ends like an unresolved chord with no one any the wiser. Jeune et Ennui would arguably make a more apposite title.",Young & Beautiful

5,Reno-Rangan,From negligence & emptiness to exploration.,8,10 April 2014,"It is a French drama directed by 'In the House' director which chronicles a teenage girl's sexual exploration. A plain story, but well transformed into a movie with good cast and performances.The subject briefs how a girl can slip away from her actual goal when life filled with loneliness. Sometimes within the family, the negligence of parents puts their children pick wrong path. As the result they move on the way they encounter in a life junction. In such style this movie travels where a girl from this story begin to engage in sexual activities which makes feel her emptiness go away apart from her good companion, her little brother.With the help of todays technology it is not hard to find the desired one and to conceal from others. It is nothing like the few decades ago, now, the young people can cleanly cover up the wrongdoing from their parents. So this movie can be useful to study about the teenager character behaviours.Very clever performance by character Isabelle. Her seductive facial look makes men stick firm with the movie till the end. It had no puzzle to solve like the director's earlier movie, but used teenager to portray her issues in four seasons. As the change of one season to another kind of failed to transform character together which made tough to understand.Bringing up emotions and family to solve the final portion was a nice patch. Overall, the simple concept was illustrated in a satisfactory manner. The 'Young & Beautiful' was neither about a nymphomaniac nor prostitution, but kind of exploiting both to depict how a modern day secret societal system work.7.5/10",Young & Beautiful
6,videorama-759-859391,Young and beautifully themed,7,30 November 2017,"We walk a familiar path with this one. I've seen it before in a few other resembling films, Elles, Student Services. Thank god it changes track, second half, the better half, and heads into a much more dramatic direction, though again, with some familiaritie's along the way. We see her, from the opening frame, through simulated binocular vision sun baking on the quiet ocean shore, little brother perving from above, which brought me back to my childhood, while vacationing. Then we see her bra less, and it is a beautiful sight, I must admit, and there are some other nice ones later on, we're generously afforded. She does it with her first love, pre turning seventeen, before we're back in the big smoke, and we cut to the b.s. to see our hot Isabelle (Veitch) heading to the door of a 70's john, who becomes her main one. A tragic event later on, during a session of passionate, loveless sex, brings to the mind an exact same scene from the shallow Slovenian Girl, years earlier. Veitch of course gets addicted, where her Mum, and stepdad are oblivious, until the aftermath of that tragic event, and from here, the film improves, gathering a lot of spice, where I for one was thankful. Through all of this, Veitch acts love repressed, which were led to believed, mostly the catalyst was her former holiday love she lost her virginity too. Veitch is hot and there are some quite raunchy scenes, one involving oral with her and her main old john, prior to his carking day, but nothing too explicit, some eye oglers will be disappointed. I kind of got a bit more what I expected from what I thought would be again, a shallow in the life of a sex student film, although there is still of shallowness there. It's final scene was beautifully thought provoking, featuring a fine actress, donning a bad wig. The relationship between sister, and little brother I really liked, where the stepdad character was written well. All in in, YAB is an enjoyable art house adult drama, kind of ambiguously erotic, but Veitch is something to eat up. Kind of hauntingly music score attached.",Young & Beautiful
7,TdSmth5,Could have been a great movie but settles for emptiness,7,27 July 2015,"Isabelle is a 16 year-old French girl. She is indeed beautiful, like a runway model, and just as expressionless throughout the entire movie. We meet her during a family summer vacation in the coast of France. During this vacation she loses her virginity to a German tourist. She has no feelings for him and no feelings or emotions about this event. Her little brother acts like a confidant and girlfriend of sorts since she doesn't seem to have any real friends, male nor female. At some point she celebrates her 17th birthday.Summer vacation ends and we meet are again sometime in the Fall, now a full-blown prostitute! No explanation or reasons are given. She maintains appearances for the family, she goes to school, claims to do homework with friends but spends her afternoons at hotels seeing mostly old men with various sexual appetites. One of them tells her ""whore for a day, whore for life."" She hides all her money, and it must be a lot, and her fancy clothes and somehow the family is clueless. One night she goes with her mom and stepdad to the opera. There she runs into one of her clients who pretends not to see her. She also catches her mom getting touchy with a family friend, with whose family they went on vacation during summer. From talking with a friend at school we gather that the reason she went into prostitution is entirely for the money so she can buy fancy stuff. Whether she actually buys anything is not clear.It takes the movie 40 minutes to decide whether it wants to tell a story or whether it's just going to be a window into someone's lame life. One day one of the old geezers croaks in the middle of sex. Isabelle escapes the hotel without telling anyone. Next, the police visit her mom at work and reveal Isabelle's secret life to her. They go trough her stuff, her computer where they find her prostitute profile, her money, work clothes, etc. The mom flips out. No more computers, no more escapades, no more social life. That and therapy. Isabelle in her aloofness pretends this has nothing to do with her. She even manipulatively flirts with her stepfather and therapist. But during interrogation we learn how she got into prostitution to begin with. One day leaving school she was approached by a guy who offered her money. Presumably she accepted. That, and she likes meeting new people. We learn that her father sends her money during birthdays and Christmas but is otherwise completely absent in her life.By now it's Winter and the mom allows Isabelle to accompany a friend to a party. There she meets a guy, they make out and end up being a couple. Later she tells him it's over. While babysitting she connects online with her work SIM card and discovers a lot of messages. Then she decides to meet someone in a hotel. It's the wife of the deceased client.It takes a while for Young & Beautiful to get going. It did win me over eventually, not so much because of the uninteresting character of Isabelle or the completely uncharismatic Marine Vacth but more because of the rest of the cast and characters that do a good job of portraying normal family life. For a French movie, the story is quite superficial. Despite the therapy, it doesn't go deeper into the reasons for her career choice. It's not really money because she gets plenty from her family. By all accounts her family loves her and cares for her. There is an unrealistic emptiness in her life that isn't explained either. In that regard it reminded me of the even more empty ""Blue is the Warmest Color."" She has no friends, she doesn't party or fool around with friends. In the entire movie she never laughs or giggles. She smiles authentically once, when her friend takes her out to dance during the party. Again, we have to remember she's supposed to be an attractive 17 year old high school student. I don't know what the fascination is that the French have with prostitution, but the Summer episode leads you to believe this could be a good coming-of-age story. Instead the prostitution angle comes out of nowhere, and doesn't go anywhere either. The movie ends on a blank note that captures pretty much the entire movie. I think reasons and explanations could have been given that would have made this movie more meaningful, but it only barely hints at these. As long as you don't expect some enriching and profound movie, Young & Beautiful is enjoyable nonetheless.",Young & Beautiful

9,maurice_yacowar,"17-yr old becomes prostitute, learns about tenderness",8,11 January 2014,"In Young and Beautiful Francois Ozon diagnoses what sex means to the contemporary young and beautiful. With so much available not just in films like this but in hard core porn, especially on the internet, it seems commodified and devalued.Isabelle (Marine Vacth) beats her school-pal in a race to get rid of their virginity. She does it with a handsome German boy she meets on her family's summer beach vacation. Without mentioning it, her mother and stepfather seem to want to welcome the boy into the family, which puts Isabelle off him.As the police will explain her venture into prostitution, teens experiment with their sexuality, testing their limits. Isabelle carries on that double life for no other given reason. She doesn't need and doesn't spend the big bucks it earns her. She does not find apparent pleasure in the act, though she says when she's home after, she yearns to return to it. One john urges her to be more natural when she pants like internet porners.Isabelle's most sympathetic and appreciative john is the aged, Viagra-propped Georges, who dies under her. Though that drives her off prostitution it also nets her in a police investigation and her family's discovery of her double life. Their response only confirms her detachment from her parents.When Isabelle ventures into a ""normal"" sexual experience with a schoolmate, he is appreciative — and unquestioning — that she has the specialized knowledge to help him off. Say it's digital communication. But again — she loses interest in him when she sees him eagerly accepted into her family's breakfast.Isabelle finally learns what sex can be in the last scene, when she is hired for a session by Georges' widow Alice, in the room in which he died. As Alice is played by the still beautiful sex goddess Charlotte Rampling, the character comes on with immediate mythic heft. Alice and Isabelle converse candidly. Alice envies Isabelle's courage in requiring payment to prove her sexual appeal. Now, she suggests, she's too old and would have to buy her pleasure. She wants only to lie beside Isabelle, fully clothed. She accepted Georges' affairs because she knew they loved each other and shared tenderness. As she caresses Isabelle's cheek the girl dozes off. She awakens alone and the film ends on her startled rising. The restful discovery of tenderness is her true sexual awakening. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",Young & Beautiful
10,Andy-296,"Worth seeing, though not entirely successful",6,5 April 2014,"The story of a middle class teenage French prostitute during the four seasons in one year. In summer, 17 year Isabelle is vacationing with her family at a seaside location, where she loses her virginity at the beach with a young German tourist. By autumn, she is already working as a prostitute, unbeknownst to her family, having joyless sex with clients that are considerable older than her. In winter, the death of a client and the subsequent intervention of the police helps her family caught up with her side job, something which does not exactly thrill them (especially her mother, played by Geraldine Pailhas).Isabelle (played by pretty Marine Vatch) is a bit inexpressive and something of a cipher, although this might be intended by the director as to signal the aimlessness of her generation. Her closest attachment is to her brother, who is about 12, to which she confides her sex life (their relationship does not seem entirely healthy though the movie does not dwell upon this).Director Francois Ozon's preoccupations are typically French, though he is not as self indulgent as other directors of his nationality, and he is aware that he needs to engage his audience. Not a bad film, though the recent Slovenian film Slovenka tackled a similar theme more successfully. The inconclusive ending doesn't help either. Charlotte Rampling has a small cameo towards the end.",Young & Beautiful
11,bjarias,".. very nice to look at, but not much past that",5,15 July 2015,"As truly beautiful as she might be, it is not enough just to watch her on screen for ninety-five minutes, looking forlorn and pretty much totally bored.. (as were most all of us) for most of the entire time. With a better script and directing, it maybe would have amounted to something more than just a gorgeous teenager working as a high-end call girl. She does appear to have the acting talent (along with that amazing allure), but it'll have to be proved in another work. The rest of the cast is solid, and production values are good. It all boils down to a very thin storyline, with the one big question that never really gets close to being answered. Otherwise, a good portion of beautiful females out there would be selling themselves for no particular reason.",Young & Beautiful
12,Blue-Grotto,"insightful, honest and nonjudgmental",9,3 August 2014,"A person is often isolated and adrift beneath a mask of stability and security, and even beauty. Isabelle is one among them. Tied to relatives and friends that, while capable and friendly, offer little in the way of excitement, she longs to feel alive somehow. For thrills she turns to selling her body on the internet. ""Easy money is a downward spiral"" she is told. ""Blah, blah, blah"" is her response, and she seems committed enough to continue in this underworld. This insightful, honest and nonjudgmental film does not take you in directions you expect it to go in. It leaves questions open and raw. It dares, thankfully, to take you to places that mainstream films do not, and it does so in compelling ways. Seen at the 2014 Miami International Film Festival.",Young & Beautiful
13,rubenm,Fine coming-of-age film,7,24 August 2013,"The French have quite a tradition of films about prostitution. Starting of course by 'Belle de Jour', the iconic movie in which Cathérine Deneuve decides to work in a brothel out of boredom. Ten years ago, there was 'Nathalie', with Emannuelle Béart in the role of a high- class call girl who is hired to spy on a man suspected of adultery. And only two years ago, the underrated 'Elles' hit the screens, with Anaïs Demoustier as a young call girl and Juliette Binoche as a journalist writing a story about prostitution by students. These are just three examples, I'm sure there are more. And now, 'Jeune et Jolie' (Young and Beautiful) is continuing the tradition. It tells the story of Isabelle, a quiet seventeen year old girl, who for unknown reasons starts working as a call girl. The film is divided into four chapters, one for every season. In the summer part, Isabelle loses her virginity to a German hunk during a beach holiday, just days before her seventeenth birthday. The next part is set in the autumn, and already Isabelle is working as a high heeled hooker, routinely visiting paying customers in posh Parisian hotels. The next winter everything goes wrong and her parents learn about her secret life. The last part, set in spring, shows how she is trying to pick up her old life as a student, but it's difficult to erase the past. The good thing is that director François Ozon doesn't judge Isabelle, nor explains why she does what she does. He only suggests that she is not really happy, she seems remote, ill- tempered and emotionally vulnerable. Isabelle is not very popular or likable. The only one she really seems to connect to on an emotional level, is her younger brother Victor. In a recent interview, actress Marine Vacth suggests that Isabelle just wants to try something exciting. It might as well have been drugs. Ozon tells the story well. Because of the four seasons concept, the story keeps on developing. He also throws in some nice cinematographic treats, like the small scene of Isabelle and her fellow students commenting in close-up about a poem by Rimbaud. The final scene consists of a surprising twist, involving some superb acting by Charlotte Rampling. Also working very well are the songs by Françoise Hardy on the soundtrack. Apparently, 'Jeune & Jolie' has been described as 'Belle de Jour 2.0'. That is definitely exaggerated. But nevertheless, it is a fine coming-of-age film.",Young & Beautiful
14,bbickley13-921-58664,"Very quietly done, but done well",7,21 May 2014,"The movie does not beat you over the head with it's moral compass, although sometimes I wish it did. It felt like a small part of the movie due to the plot about a young seventeen year old becoming a prostitute after her first sexual experience, being so dominate in the majority of the first half. It seem like anything else they added was added just to make the movie a full feature.How the movie's story works best is that it's about a family dealing with their oldest child's problem. You can insert what ever problem that child may be having, weather it's drugs or whatever else you'd expect teenage girls to go through. The fact that prostitution is a bit extreme does not matter, as they play it down to fit this scenario.I came into the movie expecting to see French erotica and what I got was a film about a girl working through her teenage emotions, and pleasantly enjoyed the twist.",Young & Beautiful

She has no feelings about him. In the autumn she is dressed up in her mother's stolen grey shirt, blue skirt and high heels, heading towards a big downtown hotel to see Georges, a man probably five times her age, at least.

17,euroGary,Only the French...,6,23 October 2013,"'Jeune et Jolie' ('Young and Beautiful' to use its English title), from director François Ozon, is about a seventeen year-old girl who, shortly after being deflowered in an unsatisfactory encounter with a young man on holiday, is approached by an older man who offers her money for sex. Still curious about sex, she agrees and embarks on a new career as a prostitute, involving sexual encounters with a succession of older and flabbier men (this is the kind of film only the French would make in such a matter-of-fact manner!) But when one of her clients succumbs to the old 'heart-attack-while-having-sex' comedy routine, the subsequent police investigation reveals her activities to her horrified family and friends.Marine Vacth does a nice job as the girl, bringing a bit more life to the part of a young woman who finds amusement in selling her body than might some other young French actresses (it is too easy to imagine many of them going the 'monotone delivery whilst staring into the middle distance' route in an effort to portray typical French film ennui). Also well worth a mention is Géraldine Pailhas as her mother, struggling to understand her daughter's decision. Even Charlotte Rampling, who turns up towards the end as the dead man's widow, is a bit livelier than usual, continuing the good work she started in Australian film 'The Eye of the Storm'.",Young & Beautiful
18,noahgibbobaker,"Great elements and poor elements, no middle ground.",6,4 December 2020,"Young and beautiful is about a 17 year old girl who decides to become a call girl after losing her virginity. As you can expect this film is quite sexual but it doesn't feel pronographic or unjustified, I thought this was impressive as a lot of other films that have very sexual elements show extremely explicit content as a way of justifying the sexual nature of the film without actually giving the sex a purpose.There are some pretty good technical elements on display here. The cinematography was good and the score is well composed and fits each sequence well. Although it doesn't sound unique whatsoever and the main theme is overused. I thought all the performances were decent, even the child actor Fantin Ravat was pretty good. The ADR was very bad and distracting during the opening scene of the film, this doesn't last long though.For the first 15 or 20 minutes I thought this film was taking a more lighthearted approach to this story and I commended it for that. Films like curiosa take themselves way too seriously and don't work at all partly due to this sense of entitlement. I started to feel this during young and beautiful, not to the same extent as curiosa, but around the halfway mark something very important happens, the execution is quite poor and makes for an unintentionally funny moment. There are actually a few moments that got a chortle out of me when that wasn't the intention.Young and beautiful tries so hard to capture the feeling of being young and beautiful on several occasions during the film, all of these moments fall flat on their faces. It seemed like these scenes were directed by a different, more out of touch director. I would still recommend this film as I can see the appeal of it and I know some issues I have won't bother other people as much, but there's too much going against this movie to warrant any rewatches or further conversation.",Young & Beautiful
19,pivic,"Great relationships, interesting lead character, too unfocused",7,11 August 2014,"This film is quite beautiful in more than one way. It weirdly reminds me of what Marilyn Manson said when interviewed in ""Bowling For Columbine"", when Michael Moore asked him what he'd say to the kids at Columbine or the people in that community: ""I wouldn't say a single word to them. I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did.""Isabelle is the lead character in this film and as such, she leads. But not as much by talking constantly or doing a lot of extravagant stuff, as in most Hollywood-esque films; of course, Ozon's films aren't really Hollywood, thank Bog.She does as she pleases, and we're left to ponder her inner life, which is not spelled out to us. Her family life is interesting, especially where her mother and brother are concerned. Speaking of which, most of her relations with other people are interesting and her ""reactions"" to them left me interested a little longer.The scene where the bridge-with-the-locks is, to me, the least interesting and left a schmaltzy and redundant impression, yet all in all, the film works. Not one of Ozon's best, but definitely not one of his worst, and compared with other directors' works, this is a vital shot in the arm.",Young & Beautiful
20,Aoi_kdr,What a sophisticated movie!,10,22 July 2019,"I was so impressed with François Ozon. I really like him! Why could he depict such a detailed and refined psychological description? Why did I feel it nicely? I was so wondering that.
The Isabelle's beauty was one of the attractions of this movie. Of course, I liked her innocent appearance, and was fascinated with her subtle working.17-years-old-girl is such changeable, so it was unsure. Youth is fleeting and beautiful. Every second various things get into her and go out. I felt like her feeling, but I never understand it completely because I have already passed through her age. So it was so impressive.While losing her virginity, she was not a girl, neither a woman. She kept unstable in an awkward place. I coudn't resist her languorous face. The age of 17 was exact subtle unlike 18. I wondered if 18-years-old-people are recognized as the adults in France.Although there were many sex scenes, I didn't feel bad at all. Or rather, they were beautiful like arts. I guessed the reason why most customers were old aged men and Western.",Young & Beautiful
21,lucasnochez,Film Review: Young & Beautiful/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,10,27 May 2014,"The topic of teenage sexuality has always been a fascination of French auteur's and French cinema in general. Exploring the many fascinating avenues of contemporary sexual decision making and the choices of many multi-layered characters within the countless French narratives revolving around adolescents, François Ozon's latest Young & Beautiful is a mysteriously alluring tale of carnal choices and fateful meetings that shape the life of its protagonist Isabelle (played marvellously by Marine Vatch in a star-making performance) and the people's lives she touches upon her decision to become a prostitute in modern day Paris, France. Opening on a family vacation somewhere on the idyllic French coast, we are introduced to Isabelle and her family during one of their annual summer vacations. The family, a well-to do working class unit, enjoy the very simple pleasures of togetherness and vacationing. Isabelle is introduced as a beautiful and presumably innocent young seventeen year-old girl who; enjoys laying on the beach, sharing her adolescent experiences with her curious little brother Victor (Fantin Ravat), and is looking to lose her virginity to a young and handsome German boy named Felix (Lucas Prisor). Coming face-to-face with the ideal of love and fleeting innocence as well as a version of herself she may never again become, the events that unfold during this particular summer vacation are the events that shape Isabelle and her tenacious, yet completely aloof understanding of love, sex, passion and pleasure, forever.While the film premiered at last years Cannes International Film Festival, Young & Beautiful was unable to win the illustrious Palme D'Or, instead holding on to its 'in competition' nomination and watching its French relative, the instant cult classic Blue Is The Warmest Color take away the prize instead. While both films are from France and equally deal with young women's integration into a world of sexuality and the deep complexities of love, each film comments differently on the expectations of relationships and the harsh realities between the difference of love and lust. The irony of the two films lies in the exposure and expectations each film connotes. Blue, one of the most pronounced love stories of the last decade, gained its stark reputation thanks to the graphic lesbian sex scenes between its two stars and their prosthetic genitals. While Young & Beautiful is a film that follows the actions of an underage prostitute and her inability to accept love or the deep notions of human interactions with or without intercourse, Blue was the one that gained all the controversy. Young & Beautiful's protagonist Isabelle experiences a plethora of sexual preferences, from animalistic suedo-machoism, to gentle moments of tender affection, Isabelle's sexual memoir is highly dependent on her disconnection with herself and her misunderstood sexuality. Amidst sessions masturbating and boyfriends, Isabelle is less concerned than her search of the orgasm, and more preoccupied with the sexual experiences and the longing to be touched.Youth is the topic under extreme scrutiny in François Ozon's latest sexual marvel of a film. Although many may see the film as a rendezvous towards exploring the psyche behind Isabelle's choice to being a prostitute, Ozon is interested much more on the idea of normal people enacting their suppressed desires to leading lives as outcasts, vagabonds and social rejects, for no good reason at all. Young & Beautiful is a brutal film starved of reasoning and logic and saturated with fundamental desires of action, spontaneity and the idea of 'want'.Young & Beautiful radiants in its script. Elegantly written, Isabelle is at the centre of many of the revelations revealed in the film and the ways in which the characters progress. Her relationship between her brother is one that draws direct comparisons to a younger version of Brendan (Michael Fassbender) and Sissy (Carey Mulligan) in Shame, in the ways they share their sexual experiences and how they interact and have an unconditional love for one another, despite their ability to directly hurt each other. Scenes involving Isabelle and her mother Sylvie (Geraldine Palihas) are some in the best of the film, and how two women's lives of deceit and manipulation can differ so much. Isabelle interacts mostly with men, with the exception of her mother. Her relationship between her most beloved client Georges (Johan Leysen), an elderly business man who spends more time acknowledging the immense youthful beauty consuming Isabelle, provides the film with the closest thing we have to a love story. Additional scenes of Isabelle with her stepfather Patrick (Federic Pierrot), a therapist (Serge Hefez), and an unexpected client near the end of the film delivers poignant insight on the director's expectation of the imagination and impacts they have on reality.Ozon does a masterful job of elevating drama, even if it is ever so slightly. His strength lies in his nuanced ability to change the perspectives of characters and surrounding events, with very little change of aesthetics or without completely changing the dynamics of characters. Ozon's greatest talent in Young & Beautiful lies in his arresting portrait of a young woman's whose life is spiralling out of control without any rhyme or reason, and his ability to convince audience members that the moment her lifestyle is challenged with the normalities of society, it is society who must adapt, and not Isabelle.",Young & Beautiful
22,JPfanatic93,"Ozon has more to say about female sexuality, or so we are led to believe",6,4 November 2013,"François Ozon paints a titillating but rather illogical coming-of-age portrait of the seventeen year old Isabelle (Marine Vacth) who explores her sexuality over the course of a year, told in four episodes over the four seasons. In summer we witness the nubile French girl's defloration by a German boy whilst on vacation with her parents. It's not a very fulfilling first time to say the least, as the young man humps her in a rather unflattering way (though alcohol is partially to blame). In the next season Isabelle chooses a secret life of prostitution, the suggested notion being to seek out other sexual options with men of various ages and preferences to really find out what she likes and desires herself. The exact reason for opting for such a drastic measure to discover her own sexual nature Ozon regrettably leaves in the dark, a rather cowardly move on his part as a writer, since it requires quite a leap of faith to take this decision for granted, one most spectators will have difficulty with. Vacth (actual age 23) nevertheless exhibits a brave performance in her role as hooker, as she is seen nude throughout the film on a regular basis throughout many a steaming sex scene, some exerting a genuine sense of tenderness and even playfulness, but others falling into a category of either unpleasant to watch to the point of debasing, or just awkward redundancy as we fully understood she was a prostitute at that point in the story. Despite all the intercourse she partakes in, the only real connection Isabelle experiences is with an old man who actually seems to care about her as a person too, instead of simply as a body for hire. Unfortunately she proves too much for his weak heart which expires as they have sex one time too many, after which Isabelle's hidden profession comes to light to the police, and ultimately her parents. Over the next two seasons, the girl must cope with her double life, her mother even more so, and come to terms with the reason why she chose such a dangerous and desperate path for her self-exploration. A clear answer is sadly never provided, so we are led to believe that any girl whose first time isn't pretty could easily go down the same route. Isabelle, however, must also deal with the death of a man, especially when she meets his widow (Charlotte Rampling) in spring, who seeks answers of her own regarding his demise. An overly mutually understanding confrontation follows, which further adds to the plot's credibility being stretched further than it ought to be. With Jeune & Jolie Ozon doesn't penetrate the realm of female sexuality for the first time (e.g. Swimming Pool for example), but he does so in his least convincing film to date. Nevertheless, thanks to strong performances by the cast overall and Vacth in particular, as well as genuinely compelling emotions being stirred in the various revelations (not answers, mind you) of the details of Isabelle's life, Jeune & Jolie is still a far cry from the mindless sensational soft-erotic drivel it would otherwise have become.",Young & Beautiful

What was that? Just because it's French, just because it's Ozon, just because the young lady (no lady at all, I'm being polite) is nubile, just because the cinematography is ok doesn't make this piece of human refuse a movie.
What did they give this young actress to entice her to participate in such degrading misogynistic voyeurism?
No narrative structure, no psychological resonance, no explanation of any kind why all the characters move like unmotivated zombies through their sleazy existence. No nuance of any kind whatsoever.
Trashy voyeuristic and exploitative. A sad sad business all round, actors, writers, director etc reaching extraordinary depths of cinematic and moral depravity.
It's not the sex that's immoral, it's the total absence of credible experiential and motivational substance to give it some meaning. The pits.",Young & Beautiful

25,gufi-04429,beautiful to look at but nothing more,5,17 February 2019,The movie doesn't have a point. Nothing much is happening and there's nothing memorable. At least it's not too long. The main character Isabelle is a real beauty though and if it wasn't for her this movie would be worse.,Young & Beautiful
26,Nobody-27,Poor idea poorly executed,3,16 February 2018,"Before anyone gets a wrong idea that I am not a fan of French cinema, I have to say that I am quite the opposite, and it is with that state of mind that I approached this film. I really wanted to like it, and was willing to forgive many small and even some bigger mistakes.
But, when an entire film is based on an unbelievable premise due to lack of motivation (and clear presence of repulsion toward such!), and when everything that follows is portrayed with distinct sense of repulsion, all of it wrapped up in a poor story, and even poorer observation of characters, there is really not much to celebrate here. The only reason I give this film three stars is Marine Vatch who was absolutely superb in her understated performance. Other than that, most everything was disappointing, from start to finish.
The story could have been interesting if it better written. However, as it is, there is nothing to root for, nothing to discover, nothing to gain from watching what amounts to ""watching the paint dry"". It is slow, bordering with boring all the time, and the worst of all - empty. Devoid of any real emotion, good or bad. It is ennui at its worst.
The ending missed a great opportunity for redemption, the middle part missed a great opportunity for some introspection, and the beginning missed a decent setup - as to why is the she doing the stuff she is doing... unless, of course, all you are after is a typical middle aged men's wet fantasy of a teenage girl who loves to get in bed with them.
It appears that ""Jeune and Jollie"" is a thinly veiled attempt at selling us some sex as ""deep and understated"". It is neither deep nor understated, it is simply shallow and pointless. And yes, Marine is gorgeous, dressed or naked. I prefer her dressed as those other scenes were done in such poor taste I had to look away (literally).
Not recommended at all, except as an insight into how quickly French cinema is failing.",Young & Beautiful
27,cthetrancedone,Her Face,10,17 March 2021,"Francois Ozon does it again, a beautiful work of art.My favourite movie of all time is Swimming Pool which is in a unique place of its own.Young And Beautiful as with Swimming Pool studies a young teenage girl coming of age with her sexuality.Marine Vacth is a superb actress here in her early 20s playing 17 year old Isabelle.The sex scenes are real, so very real showing the intense emotion throughout from Isabelle.I really felt for Isabella especially with her Mother turning on her in a disturbing scene and of course with the nasty clients.Francois lets the movie live forever with the viewer, leaving us to figure out for ourselves why she does what she does. As with Swimming Pool's jaw dropping super twister of an ending, leaving the viewer to decide what to believe.It stays with you.Isabelle's face is the icon of this movie, especially during her last sexual encounter, a scene that is unforgettable.",Young & Beautiful
28,jcnsoflorida,Tres French Indie Art Sleeper,8,10 January 2015,"Nytimes describes director Ozon's oeuvre as uneven and, while I agree, this is one of his better outings. It's slowish and without much drama but I believe all that's intentional. One of the many fascinating things about Jeune & jolie, for me, is how clearly it is not aimed at American auds, who would certainly expect more drama from the material Almost comically absent from J & j is antihero Isabelle's school life. She attends a good Paris secondary school but we never see her study. Maybe she doesn't need to. In any case, the film is obviously not about her formal education. Others have mentioned Belle de Jour. Yes! B j (the film) is almost 50 years old, so why not another take? Look at how they are alike and different. No surrealism in this latter-day version but the languidness is purposeful. Why? Ozon wrote and directed, and if we put aside our expectations and constantly wonder why he makes the choices he makes here, we won't get many answers. But we do have an understated film --IsaBelle de Jour?-- that is not easy to dismiss. Underrated, too.",Young & Beautiful
29,arriva,Some conclusions,1,19 January 2019,"So, what does this movie teach us?* At the age of 17 it's natural for a young beautiful French woman to try herself as a prostitute without any reasons for that.
* The work of a prostitute lacks any perils whatsoever, and it's even OK to have unprotected sex as long as your client claims he's married and shows you a ring. There are no STDs in this world at all.
* You may lie to your parents about the things which can be extremely dangerous.
* Almost everyone is cheating on everyone.
* A 17 old girl (a female friend of the protagonist) is crying because the guy could only have sex with her for three minutes before ejaculating which is absolutely normal for a first sex.
* The death of one her clients is barely investigated if anything.
* The police may come into your house without a search warrant yet searches through everything.
* Parties for the young in France consist of insane amounts of booze, drugs and it's OK to have group sex publicly.
* Not living with your own father who divorced your cheating mother while you were very young is enough of a reason to fall in love with a 60 years old guy who's gentle with you.I can't recommend this film to anyone with a brain.",Young & Beautiful
30,roland-scialom,Why this girl decided to be a prostitute?,7,27 February 2015,"Isabelle, a seventeen years old beautiful girl, who belongs to a middle class family with a good standing of living, who attends a good school in which she seems to be doing well, decides by herself to become a prostitute who fix rendezvous in hotel rooms, with customers much more old than her, via internet and mobile phone messaging.Her decision comes after an episode which happened during a summer vacation when she lost her virginity with a boy friend with respect to whom she was indifferent. This experience was unpleasant to her.The film don't give to the spectator any clue about the reason why she decided to become a prostitute. My interpretation is that, instead of developing her libido in a healthy way, she did it in a wrong and vicious way. Actually, she doesn't enjoy sex but enjoy the idea of behaving as a prostitute very well rewarded for her job.The story doesn't show this shocking behaviour as a disgrace, but just as something wrong.Eventually, after the death of a customer whom she liked, Georges, and the threats from both the police and her mother, she quits prostitution.The last scene in which the Georges' wife fix a rendezvous with her, in the same hotel room in which Georges died is very interesting, but also doesn't give any clue about what is right and what is wrong.Concluding, the film is interesting and caught my attention till the end, but it didn't answer my quests.",Young & Beautiful

If you try to read the movie in the anglo-saxon way, you can't understand its language. Not the French, the pictures.Being used to another kind of narrating, you could almost find this heartless.

33,JasonSmithRoberts,surpsiingly good,7,30 July 2021,"The French have quite a tradition of films about prostitution. Starting of course by 'Belle de Jour', the iconic movie in which Cathérine Deneuve decides to work in a brothel out of boredom. Ten years ago, there was 'Nathalie', with Emannuelle Béart in the role of a high- class call girl who is hired to spy on a man suspected of adultery. And only two years ago, the underrated 'Elles' hit the screens, with Anaïs Demoustier as a young call girl and Juliette Binoche as a journalist writing a story about prostitution by students.

34,mistercsays1,It's not for love or money.,7,8 May 2014,"A carefully constructed work that reflects the style and pace of previous films from director Francois Ozon, Young and Beautiful tracks a 12-month period in the life of 17-year-old Isabelle (Marine Vacth) as she explores her sexuality by taking up the world's oldest profession, unbeknownst to her parents or friends. Typically in films exploring young women turning to prostitution, such actions are driven by financial necessity or social circumstances. However, what is most interesting about this particular story is that neither Ozon, nor Isabelle herself, offer any reason for her decision. Safely entrenched in a French middle class family that comprises mother Sylvie (Geraldine Pailhas), step-father Patrick (Frederic Pierrot) and younger brother Victor (Fantin Ravat), Isabelle does not want for much and shows little interest in the money she earns. What results is a psychological study of sorts as we try to unravel the motivations of a young woman who gives very little away. The story is told over the course of four seasons, kicking off in summer with Isabelle and her family enjoying a beachside vacation. When we first meet Isabelle, she is sunbathing topless on the sand, unaware that Victor is watching her through binoculars from above the beach. Whilst their relationship seems strained at first, we quickly learn that the bond between the two siblings is actually quite strong. When Isabelle loses her virginity on the eve of her 17th birthday, the experience leaves her somewhat underwhelmed and seems to serve as the catalyst for her explorations into the world of prostitution. Somewhat disconnected from her well-meaning but misguided mother and displaying a disenchantment with people in general and sex in particular – there is no obvious motivation behind her actions - Isabelle is able to go about her business with impunity until an unfortunate incident brings the police to her door. Ozon, who also wrote the screenplay, seems to be making a statement about the hypocrisies surrounding morality and sex. At one point, Sylvie is encouraging her daughter to go out and meet men, even leaving condoms for her, but is then outraged when she finds out that Isabelle has been doing exactly that, only charging for the pleasure of her company. Why is it okay for her to seek sex with men for pleasure but not for profit? Furthermore, Isabelle is protected from prosecution because, at 17, she is considered a victim in the various interactions with her customers. The fact that somebody can go from being a victim to a criminal simply because they have turned 18 seems ludicrous and it is a point well-made given the fact that Isabelle is not beholden to anybody; she works alone and has not been coerced into anything. Furthermore, Sylvie's efforts at occupying the moral high ground are undermined by the fact that she seems to be having an affair with family friend.Of course, the film also has plenty to say about men and the various sexual and emotional insecurities they possess that enable Isabelle's business to flourish. Isabelle's beauty mesmerises all around her and results in a few awkward moments - such as Victor watching her masturbate and Patrick lingering just a moment too long when he accidentally stumbles upon her in the shower. However, whilst there is nudity and numerous sex scenes, Ozon never fixates on the flesh; a contrast to the approach in other recent releases such as Nymphomaniac or Blue is the Warmest Colour. In many ways though, Isabelle is a typical teenager; she attends high school and treats her parents the way any teen might. That is, she sees them as the enemy and is reluctant to engage with them unless absolutely necessary. However, she never blames her parents for the choices she makes and admits to the therapist she is forced to see that her mother provides her with everything she wants.The tone and pace of Young and Beautiful is akin to Ozon's earlier works such as Swimming Pool ¬and In the House, rather than his more outlandish Potiche. It is sedate but never dull and his refusal to indulge in backstory or justifications for Isabelle's actions is evidence of his faith in an audience to make up their own mind. With a hauntingly effective performance from newcomer Vacth, an ambiguity that maintains intrigue and a fabulous final scene featuring Charlotte Rampling, this is a coming-of-age story that is refreshingly devoid of simplicity and predictability in its exploration of identity and sexuality.",Young & Beautiful

37,De_Sam,"Ozon, the first mainstream 'queer' filmmaker",7,28 February 2018,"The Nouvelle Vague originated from an ideology postulated in Cahiers du Cinéma in the '50s, specifically the idea that film could no longer be ruled by its narrative (which was often an adaptation of other media, particularly critically-acclaimed literary works) but should be completely dictated by the director or, as he was called when fulfilling this role, the 'auteur'. Thus the reactionary countermovement of the Nouvelle Vague proposed a sudden shift from narrative to formal and experimental factors as indicators of quality. Concerning this focus on the formal aspect was the preference of the Cahiers du Cinéma Critics for the mise-en-scène, namely the long take and deep-focus aesthetic (Cook, 2004; Gibbs, 2002).Indeed, the auteur theory or politique des auteurs continues to dominate in the discourse surrounding film, especially in journalistic circles. However, auteur theory has evolved since the Nouvelle Vague, as Kate Ince has illustrated in her analysis of François Ozon; it is no longer the aesthetical techniques in a director's body of work but recurring themes that identify an 'auteur' (2008). The change in meaning of 'auteur' is a clear index of the extent to which the 'broken thread' as Olivier Assayas called it has been reattached. In view of Ince's analysis, which uses the concepts of the Cahiers du Cinéma critics in a diametrical way, it seems that the abandonment of the 'nouvelle vague auteur' has fully disseminated in the academic discourse of film studies. The director is no longer seen as being able to dictate every aspect of the film production process, the only thing he has complete control over is the thematic content (Maule, 2008). As a consequence of the reinterpretation of the auteur theory, content analyses have become more commonplace leading to a declination in the number of formal analyses. For the purpose of complementing Ince's analysis of Ozon's work this essay will perform a close stylistic analysis of the film style in Jeune & Jolie (2013). In addition, it will provide empirical evidence to the claim that the post-nouvelle vague directors reintegrated and re-evaluated the narrative film tradition and style.Consequently, Assayas asserted that directors such as André Téchiné, Maurice Pialat, Jean Eustace and other post-nouvelle vague directors ""re-attached the broken thread"". In other words they reconciled with the film tradition that was rejected by the Cahier du Cinéma critics. Thus, filmmakers were no longer limited to a long take, deep-focus or, alternatively, an experimental film style. By adapting the existing stylistic tactics, which were institutionalised during the first half of the 20th century, films could once again be a medium to convey narratives.The methodology of the stylistic analysis is rooted in the cognitive film theory of David Bordwell, who proposed an empirical way of analysing the formal aspects of film in Figures Traced in Light. This essay will mainly utilise concepts from the first chapter, titled 'Staging and Style'. Firstly, Jeune & Jolie is created utilising the continuity editing of classical Hollywood, what Bordwell has postulated as the system of editing that least obstructs the viewer in his construction of the narrative while watching the film (1985). Since Ozon opts for this mode of editing it seems evident that he puts more emphasis on the narrative than on the formal aspect of his film. In the second place, Ozon utilises the traditional schemata of opening a scene with an establishing shot, followed by a recurring shot-reverse-shot scheme in which the major participants in the conversation appear alone in frame or is seen over the shoulder of another character (Bordwell, 2005). He uses the schemata for 18 scenes throughout Jeune & Jolie and therefore it constitutes the large part of all poly- and dialogues. Bordwell has noted that this schemata is one of the oldest, most institutionalised and accordingly the most understood method of showing a scene involving dialogue. Thus, once again Ozon elects to emphasize conveying the narrative instead of experimenting with the film form. Thirdly, the characters in Ozon's film dominate the frame and direct the camera, owing to the absence of any open frames; either montage or camera movement reframes the main character when he/she is about to leave the frame. This is most pronounced with the protagonist Isabelle, played by Marine Vacth. The way she is framed differs from the mood of the scene, generally falling into three major categories: BCU or CU for the emotional intense scenes, VLS or LS to show her progressing alienation from her environment and personal relationships, and lastly medium shots for neutral scenes. As a final point, Ozon incorporates not only the film style of the pre-nouvelle vague French Cinema, but also the whole of Western film tradition, dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. This is logical given the way the solution to a specific staging problem is passed on from filmmaker to filmmaker on a global scale, as western films are distributed throughout the entire Western world. Returning to the insistence of Ince that Ozon is an auteur on the basis of his content, this limited stylistic analysis has proven that he does not assert his personal mark on the aesthetic of the film. However, Ince has correctly concluded that Ozon dictates the themes in his film, leading him to be the ""first mainstream queer filmmaker"" (2008, p. 31). To conclude, in the contemporary French film industry an auteur is no longer determined by his style but by the recurring themes in his oeuvre. Film style has once again become a universal tool to help immerse the audience in the film and convey the narrative of the director.Bordwell, D. (1985).

38,mehmet_kurtkaya,"Trier'ish Haneke salute with Ozon touch, Bunuel inspired !",6,31 December 2013,"The movie creates ambivalent thoughts and feelings on many levels, on historic perspective, on the political grounds covered in sexual atmosphere prevalent in the West with case in point France, on the use of stereotypes and quality of storytelling.Not much has changed in the West since Bunuel's Belle Du Jour. Its fallen capitalist system and the inevitable alienation and hypocrisy that shows itself in multiple facets of society including sexuality. I would add Ozon's own fixation on gay themes even in heterosexual films as an another result. In fact he makes as a director exactly what he criticizes in his film subject, so another level of Western hypocrisy.So pretty Marine Vocht is! Well cast, well played. Her character asexual most of the time, a naive girl that sometimes grows up.There is a slight directing fallout in the collage of sex scenes which falls flat, at times the movie just touches barely some of the themes and stays superficial.Haneke's Cache corridors in the hotel were perfect! Immediately recognizable, Cache being one of the best European movies of all time.Moral and sexual hypocrisy of the middle class is shown well a la Trier but much softer. Softer than Habla con Ella from Almodovar too.Stereotyping of the German or the seemingly Middle Eastern guy had some truth in it and showing them side by side with French men was the right thing to do, showing the materialism transcending borders.Psychologically the film explores known but important themes of narcissism, loneliness, alienation, vulnerability, an epidemic in the capitalist West. And on prostitution it was an interesting take with Charlotte Rampling's character and again did stay superficial since it ignores the system at the base.It was great to see the girl being sorry for death of the guy rather than her prostitution. That violence and in general death gets a pass in the media and society while sexual escapades are always frowned upon.All in all, it was good to see this film.",Young & Beautiful
39,GrowMagicBeans,A subject matter dealt with the subtlety that only French Movie can.,9,4 December 2013,"Having lived a relatively sheltered life, a young 17 year old girl, Isabelle (Marine Vacth), begins to explore her sexuality in rather a risqué fashion. We meet Isabelle on holiday on the eve of her 17th birthday. While on vacation, she meets a German boy and has an underwhelming first sexual experience. We meet her again in the Autumn to learn she is now leading a double life, moonlighting as a high class escort while still living under her mother's roof and attending school.Of course there are some very ugly situations and in some hard to watch scenes, we see Isabelle near accepting the degrading attitude of some of her clients as if it is all her self worth, but then we also get to see her striking up a tender relationship of a different kind, with a much older man and later witness a conceited smile as she turns on her phone to a plethora of messages. Why does she do this to herself? Is it a form of self-harm or a narcissism? Is it an addiction, spurred from a desire to be loved without outwardly feeling capable of loving? Does she do it for the danger, the fear, the excitement, or is the money a factor also? Is it part due to having an estranged father? Does she enjoy it because it endows her with power over men and draws jealousy and insecurity from women? Or is she simply feeling starved of experience and hungers exploration?All these questions are certainly posed or at least hinted at, but don't expect clear explanations or moral conclusions. No, the movie explores these themes without outrightly condemning or condoning her actions. Yes, Isabelle does draw herself into difficulty through her actions, but the discourse of this movie is not one of the obvious cause and effect we have come to know from mainstream cinema. There is no deus et machina to extricate an easy exit or satisfactory fix or lesson well learnt or crime punished. There are only the awkward moments that life throws at us in unexpected ways and uncomfortable truths that may never be satisfactorily reconciled. In other words, we are looking through a window into but a moment within this young lady's life --the passing of a year, the exploration of her sexuality-- and the fascinating aspect of this movie is that we see her live out the extraordinary in quite an ordinary way.",Young & Beautiful

In this ozon's movie I especially appreciate the ""lack of expression"". I find it remarkable to be able to deal with an issue such as prostitution in a totally amoral, without judgment of any kind. Interesting is the character of the mother, of course, once discovered that the activity of the daughter tries to fight it in every way. The mother's attitude suggests that she believes her daughter's deplorable attitude not for some particular reasons, do not move never actually a reasoned criticism, but simply thinks that her daughter feels wrong because it should be so and that's it.Between the lines, I think you can also see an exaltation of the present generation and a critique of the past, especially in the final scene but do not want to anticipate. The film is not a masterpiece but still got me interested, 7/10",Young & Beautiful
41,sjd912,Good thoughts - disjointed movie,7,28 January 2014,"I really liked Ozon's last film (Dans la maison), but this one was a disappointment for me. It's hard not to see this story as a bunch of first world problems. But at its core, there are several good ideas and stories - and none of them gets the spotlight. The director goes from one subplot to the other, without really developing the characters, and seemingly has no idea what to do with this story. (And this makes the ending even worse.) But time to time, some settings or the actors' performance can tell us more than a thousand words.Anyway, it's a thoughtful and basically a good movie, but it's too unfocused, unbalanced to go anywhere. If you haven't seen Dans la maison from Ozon, I'd recommend that one instead.",Young & Beautiful
42,efffigie,Not what I thought it would be.,8,30 June 2017,"This turned up on Netflix and I watched it mostly because Charlotte Rampling was in it; I'd not just watch Rampling read a phone book, I'd be okay with her just kind of standing around holding one. However, I expected an exploitation flick, and to a certain extent, that's what this is, but not altogether. There is a lot going on in this here Un De Film.Yeah, it's kind of about some drop-dead gorgeous French teenager from a well-off Euro-prog family inexplicably deciding to become a hooker, and the movie makes no effort to explain, in words, why; and that seems to bother a lot of reviewers. I kind of half-watched it until the scene where Isabelle has sex for the first time, and then was really and truly appalled. In my real life, I've had a young woman (not a girlfriend, more of a sister... hard to explain) describe a supposedly consensual experience in exactly these terms: looking at herself, it wasn't happening to her, etc. and in real life she was unable to explain to me WHY she found the experience so devastating. She insisted the encounter was consensual and absolutely not the guy's fault. But she clearly suffered a deeply traumatic experience, and it did affect her in a very, very serious way. I asked her about after a time and how she felt, and she answered with the following declaration, with a grim facial expression: ""It doesn't matter, what's one f*** more or less."" And then continued in sexual behavior that clearly she was unhappy with. To say I was horrified is a gross understatement. So I've dealt with a very similar situation. My take is that some people, regardless of biological status or physical age, simply do not have the emotional maturity to have truly consensual sex with another person at certain stages. Not everyone really matures at identical rates; and after a number of years of thinking, it seems to me that some people engage in sex because they feel it to be a societal norm, and if they don't, they feel they're not 'normal'. The woman, too, in real life, was a knock-out; an extremely beautiful woman, so much so it was a pain to do social things with her due to the constant advances she'd get. Men (and some women) would just lose their minds. She was also European, from that Euro-prog environment depicted in this movie.When Isabelle accepts the offer of money-for-sex, did it occur to anyone it might be a (traumatic) response to the knowledge she's expected to engage in sex due to her society, but doesn't enjoy the 'act' at all, or at least with another person? And that the money (which is shown as not really about the money) serves as symbolic compensation for a socially- expected act she finds demeaning, shaming, and humiliating? The money then acts as a kind of 'control': SHE is in charge, SHE decides who she has sex with, SHE controls the set-up of the situation. The one episode of 'bad sex' she has, isn't an assault or rape but the john not paying her properly, and she is shown having an angry tantrum. Like the little kid she really is, inside.Seeing it this way, the mother leaving condoms out for her, encouraging her to have 'normal' sex with 'nice boys', is gross and appalling: how is the mother not just pimping Isabelle out, herself? Inviting these boys to the dinner table, into their house? Into the family? Why doesn't she just invite one of Isabelle's johns while she's at it? The question of, ""Why would you have sex for money?"" is then morphed in Isabelle's mind into, ""Why would any woman have sex for free?"" The party scene would have been much clearer if, like the apartment in FIGHT CLUB with the furniture, there had been little pop-ups from Isabelle's mind pricing out all the fumbling sexual behavior she sees... before she leaves the party in obvious disgust. To meet a 'nice boy' she refuses to have sex with, or at least not right away. All I can say is, I half-agree with the reviewer from Turkey, about the indictment of 'vapid Western culture', insofar as it's my firm belief that no single culture is one-size-fits-all. Some women are perfectly fine with a culture of open, early, sexuality; some women are just not. And that social expectations are an extremely powerful thing that can really damage people very badly. I hated the depicted, so-called 'parents' in this movie: what a pack of insipid, clueless fools, stuffing their 'free' value system down the throat of their own daughter, who can't cope with it. About the only character that really came across well was the younger brother. Oh: Charlotte Rampling was smashing.",Young & Beautiful
43,juanmlleras,A very sad and sordid story,2,14 October 2014,"I have to tell that I was so disappointed by this movie that I left the theater about 40 minutes into the film. My summary is that life has already to many sordid things to sit in a film to look at the sordid world of a young woman turning herself into a call girl. I could not find any artistic value in this film, although it has some good photography. As to a plot other than the process of a girl turning into a whore, I could find none. Direction is mostly focused on showing the main actress tits. I found this film voyeuristic, void of plot and sordid. If you want to learn about this subject instead of going into this film, interview a young call girl. If you are a voyeur, you might like this piece of human garbage.",Young & Beautiful
44,ohthatgigi,what happened in the year when Isabelle was seventeen.,7,30 April 2014,"The beauty of the film lies predominantly on its vulnerable, delicate goddesy protagonist,Isabelle,who looks outrageously like alike a younger version of Julia Roberts, with a touch of girly innocence and less obtrusive, this is a star that brings the summer beach a shred of rosie taint and gossamer hormone heat. The film is not interested in giving a psychoanalysis of the characters' peculiar behaviors, nor inducing the audience's judgmental call by laying down a handful of evidentiary background. It simply told a story that I feel related to, as a precocious girl myself, the changing in my mentality on a daily basis is tantalizing, probably too chimerical to keep pace with the physique changing, and those changes keep pushing the boundaries with invisible flame burning inside me, I also like the excitement when received a message from a total stranger, putting on makeup for fun or just for practice, and going out in the noisy gloomy so that by the time I walk out of the building it will be dark, like a whole day just passed without notice. The fortunate difference is I've never encountered a traumatic emergency like that, I gradually stop this practice because my schoolwork is getting overwhelmed and have no mood to more rendezvous. If I have to make one disapproving point in the movie is its depiction of Isabelle's family and her relationship with her mother, which sort of allow the beautiful story become a generic and predictive one, of course, if there's a mischievous girl, we have to analyze her childhood memories and possible traumatic influence, there simply HAS to be a reason to justify its abnormality, a system of diagnosis and precedents with similar syndrome has to exist for us to corroborate and understand or even predict the behaviors. This psychoanalysis compulsiveness often baffles me when the concept of individuality seems to be quiet pervasively understood by the general populace, children growing in a wealthy and happy family can become all sort of formation whether you like it or not, and trying to label this as 'self objectification' or 'self-worth seeking''juvenile recalcitrance''coquettish trials to experience the feelings of growing mature'is not gonna work. The relationship with her brother is beyond reproach though, in a primevally inquisitive and extremely genuine way, without fixing a value- laden adult assumption to it, the two siblings witness each other's growth with each other's innocent eyes, devoid of perversion or intrusion of the world of morally adults.",Young & Beautiful
45,brandonleewainscott,"Thought provoking, but not a GREAT movie. Good by not great",7,18 August 2015,"I liked it. I love French film, and it was on Netflix. I have a special pity for women forced into prostitution by whatever circumstance. It really makes you think about the reality of the life of a call girl, whom one calls for pleasure. If you treat her well, respecting her, like the old man did, fine. But think about how many men treat her like crap. And that's what this film does. The actress is naturally beautiful. The relationship with her brother adds a good element to it that might otherwise cause it to be stagnant. The problem is not that this movie lacks a bunch of dialogue or action. That's if you want Hollywood nonsense. This is a well made film. I just don't find it GREAT. But I might watch it again. But I am not dying to.",Young & Beautiful
46,DmytroBaker,Absurdly complex eroticism.,8,5 November 2019,"There is a confident feeling that François Ozon has chosen a serious topic for this work, but, as is often the case in his films, a comedy of absurdity very soon comes out from under the cover of seriousness, in this case mixed with erotic fantasy.The main character, Marine Vacth, a former model, is understandably selfless in bed scenes, but something more is noticeable in her game. Her glance reads either steel coldness or vulnerability. Isabelle is experienced and cynical beyond her years, but she is lost and deeply unhappy.From the chosen topic, Ozon absolutely intentionally ""sucks"" the entire socio-statistical context, giving it no more significance than excess air. His heroine is not a teenager on the panel, but a beautiful girl who non-trivially explores her own sexuality and sensuality, which, in the end, are important only at the end of the path or at the end of this particular story.Watch is worth it, but carefully.",Young & Beautiful
47,sarah_venn,Sexy French coming of age film,7,17 December 2013,"Review for the Bath Film Festival, check it out online at: http://bathffblogger.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/young-beautiful/French and sexy usually go hand in hand, and this film is no exception. Young and Beautiful, or in French - Jeune et Jolie- is a coming of age story of 17 year old Isabelle (Marine Vatch) told across four seasons as she discovers and experiments with her sexuality. In the first season – Summer, Isabelle loses her virginity to Felix, a German boy while on holiday. The experience is not great and she has no emotional connection with the boy or the act itself, portrayed through her out of body experience. In Autumn Isabelle is striding through Paris in high heels and meeting clients in hotel rooms and car parks. She remains emotionally detached, and no real reason is given as to why she enters the world of prostitution which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing. The film is concerned with her actions and her behaviours rather than the psychology behind them. It is safe to say that the film has a lot of nudity and sex scenes in it, which you would expect from a film about prostitution! Despite her emotional detachment she develops more of a bond with one client Georges (Johan Leyson) and meets him regularly at the same hotel in the same room, until one fateful afternoon when Georges' heart just can't keep up and he dies while having sex with Isabelle. This sees the end of Isabelle meeting clients. However, come Winter the police are investigating Georges death and track her down through CCTV footage. This section of film deals with the aftermath of her family finding out about Isabelle selling her body for sex. Her mother, Sylvie brilliantly portrayed by Geraldine Pailhas, By Spring Isabelle is starting to act like a normal teenage girl; going to parties, having a boyfriend and trying to put the past behind her. We think she's going to be alright, have a regular life, but she dumps her boyfriend with such coolness after a family breakfast and without any apparent reason. Then she reinserts her old sim card into her phone and immediately receives text after text. We then see her going to the same hotel she used to meet Georges in and she meets his widow Alice (Charlotte Rampling) which gives an unexpected end to the film.",Young & Beautiful
48,Sellers5,Interesting but shallow,6,22 August 2013,"A young and beautiful girl sells her body to rich older men, lying about her age, and hiding it to her parents and friends. Until an unexpected event forces her to confront reality. The new film's subject from French director François Ozon is close to Julia Leigh's 2011 ""Sleeping Beauty"", but the treatment is quite different. Nothing is odd or strange here. We follow Isabelle's journey through the discovery of sexuality in a very realistic fashion, typical of Ozon's filmmaking.The only trouble is that we are not troubled ! The script is so predictable that we get very few surprises throughout the film, and we do not care for Isabelle's fate at all. That's a shame considering the interesting subject.The lack of explanation for her behavior is a good thing, we do not get the usual psychological/environment/parents syndrome, but this leads to a certain shallowness.Actors do a fine number, especially the beautiful Marine Vacth, whom we should see again very soon, hopefully in a more rewarding role.",Young & Beautiful
49,elvinzhang,The Thrill of Having Men Pay to Make Love to you,10,21 January 2016,"Isabelle is 17, astoundingly beautiful, with many young men willing to have sex with her; yet she lives a double life as a prostitute for older men showing little to no interest in the money she obtains from it.So why does she do it?The way that Ozon answers this question is what makes the Film so interesting to watch, that and of course the fact that Marine Vacth, who plays young Isabelle brilliantly, is so intensely addictive to look at.""I could only make the film if I had an actress who was fascinating to look at ... it had to be an actress that the viewer, and myself, wanted to look at - almost as you'd look at an insect.""Isabelle's first sexual experience is cold, she feels used, she imagines herself watching with absolute disgust. After this experience she decides to be a prostitute serving older men in hotels. When one client doesn't pay the full agreed fee, it seems to distress Isabelle a lot more than what we'd expect considering she shows little use for the money she earns. But evidently its not the money that distresses her its the feeling that her sex isn't worth a lot, the doubt about her personal beauty, that men don't value her enough to pay the full amount. In the bar scene Isabelle has with Alice (Charlotte Rampling) Georges's widow, Alice tells Isabelle that she always wished men would pay to make love to her. Isabelle seems to relate to this and we see that they have reached an understanding. Alice is the only person in the film who seems to understand why Isabelle engaged in prostitution.One of her regular clients, Georges, treats her more tenderly, pays without her needing to ask and seems genuinely fulfilled by her. When she explains this to the psychiatrist and that Georges's death saddened her, we realize what she really wanted, affection from her lovers which would prove that she is desirable. But since affection seemed foreign to her, she wanted proof by making men pay high amounts of money just to screw her. The assurance thrilled her and made her enjoy arranging times to offer her services. Georges was special to her, he not only payed but also acted affectionately, he asked her about her life and didn't demand much of her.On the whole, the movie is brilliant. Marine Vacth's acting is superb, and Francois Ozon shows us in an articulate manner the inexplicable and unpredictable nature of a sexually-blossoming teenager's mindset.",Young & Beautiful
50,marcelapougy,"Jeune, jolie, léthargique.",7,10 September 2014,"This film is incredibly slow and apathetic, but that's the beauty of it. Isabelle (Marine Vacth), a girl with a stable family who finds herself in a stable environment, is a strange creature. From what I've noticed, she only had a real connection with two people: her little brother and Alice (Charlotte Rampling). She decides to become a prostitute, even though she didn't need the money and could've had sex with any young guy, and her reasons to start doing such a thing aren't clear. François Ozon directed a film with a lot of million dollar questions.From my personal perspective, she did it for the taste and the thrill provided by the sense of being independent, of doing something dangerous and morally wrong. Even though she felt somewhat disgusted and guilty for having sex with strange men, she kept doing it to, somehow, prove herself that she didn't need anyone's approval to do what she wanted to do - in this case, a dangerous and morally wrong thing. She probably didn't plan to tell anyone, but her family found out in a bad way. I see her as a rebel hearted girl who feels trapped in a cage (in her case, her mother, society, morality, a nice and stable life) and who's holding back her feelings because, if she let them out, they might be too overwhelming - that's why she so apathetic all the time. Or maybe she just couldn't care less about anyone because life is boring and we're gonna die.I enjoyed the film. I enjoyed the photography, the scenarios, the actors, the language, etc. It's not an exciting production, though. It's the perfect movie to watch on a rainy Sunday, when there's nothing else to do.",Young & Beautiful

In the movie, juvenile prostitution is presented as an innocent passage in the life of young adolescent girls. Some sort of victimless game. The plot is very weak and the characters lack consistency. They are vague and their role is not clear.Spoiler ***Everything revolve about insane sex and heavy lies***. The scenario is not credible nor convincing. At times, the movie seems a documentary of some sort. With this production, it is obvious that François Ozon pleased himself filming young and pretty Marine Vacth from every conceivable angles.

52,kaylarayn,"Good Film, Insightful",7,18 November 2015,"A seemingly typical 17 year old girl, Isabelle, begins secretly selling her body to successful older men. This film is insightful and honest, without giving judgment and due to unexpected turns, we find ourselves wondering why she does what she does. Francois Ozon's Young and Beautiful portrays a young girl, Isabelle, (Marine Vacth) exploring her sexuality through prostitution after losing her virginity in a seemingly unpleasant manner. Her attitude towards these sexual encounters is very emotionless and distant. We first meet Isabelle during vacation just before her 17th birthday where she loses her virginity to a German boy, Felix. While his body is on top of hers, we see the look in Isabelle's eyes turn detached and cold. The next scene, we find that the family has returned to their home in the city. By this time she has begun meeting clients online and meeting in elegant hotel rooms, always arriving in a nice suit, but returning home in her school clothes. She has many encounters with rich older men, some of which could be old enough to be her grandfather. These encounters seem very displeasing to her. During these encounters, she seems disinterested in the money as well as the sexual act itself. She meets Georges (Johan Leysen) and her attitude towards the situation remains the same, yet we find that her encounters with him begin to change after a while. Georges takes an interest in her and we get the feeling that he genuinely cares for her. They meet often and her attitude towards the sexual acts remains basically the same, yet she becomes more comfortable during their encounters. In an unexpected turn of events, Isabelle's secret is found out by her family and they are very surprised as well as confused by her actions. She goes to see a therapist to hopefully get some insight on why she has been selling her body to these men. Like many French films, the movie leaves you wondering what happens after the ending scene. The scene when Isabelle's mother (Geraldine Pailhas) has found out and is discussing this with her daughter for the first time is very emotional. In this scene we feel the distress and confusion as well as anger from her mother towards her daughter's actions. Her mother's reaction may seem extreme, but it shows how she is hurting because of Isabelle's trysts and possibly because she sees herself in the same way that she is ridiculing Isabelle. This is one of the ways that this film shows the struggles of a family. While most families don't deal with prostitution, they have their own sins to deal with. During this confrontation, we feel pain and violence as well as love. I would recommend this film to young adults as well as older adults. Isabelle is a young and beautiful girl who comes from a stable family. We see a number of occasions when Isabelle seems almost accepting of her clients degrading comments. At times it feels as though she believes that this is her self-worth and is deserving of this. Isabelle is disinterested in the money she receives from the clients and the sexual act itself and she is called a whore. So why does she sell herself to these men then? That is one of the beauties of this film. The film goes to show one of life's greatest truths, that not everything has a clear cut answer.",Young & Beautiful
