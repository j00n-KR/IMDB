0,MartinHafer,"Well, at least it's better than ""The Temple of Doom"".",6,16 September 2021,"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is forgettable but enjoyable film. There's not a lot to love here but it is entertaining. So, I'd say this is a great candidate for the 'Time Passer' category. And so, to enjoy the film, it's best you just turn off your brain...especially with some of the really dopey scenes, such as when Indiana survives a nuclear blast by crawling inside a fridge!The plot involves Indy and the KGB searching for crystal skulls in Nevada and South America. What follows is essentially one impossible escape from death after another after another....with very little time to think or breathe between scenes.Overall, a silly and inconsequential film that cost $185,000,000 to make. And, at least it's better than ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom""!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1,TheLittleSongbird,"The weakest of the series, but actually not that bad",6,3 September 2010,"I agree Indianna Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the weakest of the series and has a lot of flaws. But it is not a bad movie. The story is not as well-thought out and paced, the script lacks that extra wit and energy, the film can get too slow and Cate Blanchett is wasted with a rather unexceptional character. And the film is perhaps a tad too long too. But.. it does look great, the costumes, sets and cinematography are still truly fabulous, and the music score is rousing enough. The action is often breathtaking, such as the motorcycle chase through a university campus, the pursuit through the Amazon Jungle, the giant ants, the secret passageways and even the alien visitors, and I liked the old school stunts. Harrsion Ford displays a good amount of world-weary charm, and Shia LaBoeuf is likable enough. Overall, it lacks excitement but it is not a bad film by all means. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2,bkoganbing,The Bullwhip Comes Out Of Retirement,6,30 May 2008,"It's been 20 years or so since the last Indiana Jones epic and I have to say in casting Harrison Ford as our whip cracking adventurer archaeologist at least he had the good sense to update the time and place to something approximating Harrison Ford's real age. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull takes place during the Eisenhower administration and after Indy has served with distinction with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II.In fact it's a British colleague who betrays Indy to set up the action here. Remember that huge warehouse where the Ark of the Covenant is stored? Apparently the Soviets are after something else there, a crystal skull with an elongated cranium that has some mystical powers. Joe Stalin is deeply interested in paranormal psychology and the power of mind control so he's sent Cate Blanchett to get that skull. Cate can barely keep a straight face with that hokey Russian accent she's adopted for the role. But she knows these films are all in fun.As for Harrison Ford he reunites with Karen Allen his lady love from the first film. He also acquires a Marlon Brando Wild One wannabe as a new sidekick in Shia LaBoeuf, late of the Disney studios. It's off to South America and the Amazon headwaters where the crystal skull is from.I will say that George Lucas is a respecter of all religions and cultures in his film. The first film dealt with the Ark of the Covenant, the second with five precious stones that are important in the Hindu religion, and the third with the Holy Grail. All show in these films the power they claim to have. And the Crystal Skull is from yet another metaphysical source. Just what you have to see the film for, but it certainly does open discussion as to who has THE true religion.John Hurt plays an archaeological colleague of Ford's who's gone a bit bonkers from contact with the Crystal Skull. He also looks like he's having a great old time putting on a crazy act.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will please devoted fans of the series and may attract a few new fans. It's not quite up to the standard of the first three, but it definitely has the right spirit.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
3,Leofwine_draca,"Not the worst ever, but far below expectations",4,4 August 2016,"How the mighty have fallen! Spielberg, once the man who could do no wrong in Hollywood, has been on the wane for many years. Since the 1980s, his films have been getting worse and worse, but this is in every respect poorer than you'd hope for from the man whose last movie was the lacklustre WAR OF THE WORLDS remake. KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is an self-indulgent fan boy's dream, a ludicrous, repetitive, and bloated mass packed with unappealing CGI effects and one of the worst scripts in recent history. I love the original INDIANA JONES trilogy, but this is similar to THE PHANTOM MENACE in that it helps tread the name of the series into the ground. No surprise that George Lucas had his greedy mitts on this one, either.The film kicks off with a ludicrous ""nuke the fridge"" episode that I could have forgiven – if it hadn't had the ridiculous shot of the fridge flying through the air and Indy walking out unscathed afterwards. Harrison Ford is older but no wiser in this film, and although the years have been kind to him, he seems to have lost his natural charisma that shone through in his '80s outings – his whip-cracking hero is a mere shadow of his former self. Blame the script, which goes overboard on the '50s setting, throwing pop-culture references down our necks every few minutes and cobbling together a ludicrous non-starter plot involving aliens. I feel like this even those I was disposed to like it – bear in mind I love stuff like flesh-eating ants and even enjoyed the brief scene in which they appear.Early on we get a chase scene in which Shia LaBeouf (an actor I despise, but even he seemed good next to the paucity of the script) and Ford are on a motorbike, escaping from KGB agents. For a few minutes, we get flashes of the old magic and I started enjoying myself. But soon the film heads across to South America and stalls, too focused on reintroducing Karen Allen as Indy's ex (nice to see her again, but she's wasted along with the rest of the cast) and delivers one ridiculous, overlong action scene after another. The biggest disappointment is the big truck chase through the jungle, which takes place roughly in the middle of the flick. It hopes to recall the classic scenes in Raiders in which Indy hangs onto the bonnets of trucks as they travel through a narrow valley, but whereas the original chases were fun and exciting, this is a mess of overblown CGI work. Really, nothing is done for real here, the whole film looks like a nonsensical cartoon: there are CGI trucks, CGI backgrounds, CGI actors, CGI monkeys and prairie dogs, CGI ants, CGI aliens. The hypocritical Spielberg recently claimed in an interview that films have too many effects in them these days, and that's true; this film is the worst offender yet.The plot plods on through repetitive waterfall drops, throwing in some natives stolen from an earlier film, then kind of ends in a SFX extravaganza that doesn't even involve our hero, who just spends the entire movie walking from one place to another and bickering with his relatives. Unsurprisingly, the actors are short changed in all this, with Jim Broadbent barely registering in an embarrassing exposition role, John Hurt stuck with his old-drunk shtick and Ray Winstone totally out of place. The worst offender is Cate Blanchett, who gives an absolutely hideous turn as the Russian villain. Blanchett seems to have based her performance (and exaggerated accent) on an old Bond flick and I was actually embarrassed for her. If this is the way that Hollywood seems to be going – making soulless kid's cartoons masquerading as real movies – then I hope Tinseltown goes bust.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
4,SnoopyStyle,Return of Ravenwood saves bad LaBeouf,7,30 December 2013,"It's 1957. The Russians are Coming. Led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), they are hounding Indiana Jones for mysterious artifacts. They even dress as American service men to attack and infiltrate an American warehouse. Later Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) enlists Indy to rescue Professor Oxley (John Hurt) who has found something in Peru. When the Soviets capture Indy again, there is a reunion with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).Starting with Russians killing American troops in Nevada is too much. It's not shocking as much as fake. Not to mention that Nevada is not exotic enough to begin the story. And Shia LaBeouf dressing like a Marlon Brando wannabe again makes it fake. The first half isn't that good.The second half starts off better with the Ravenwood reunion. Karen Allen has slowed down a little bit, but she still has a great combative energy with Harrison Ford. Meanwhile I don't see Shia LaBeouf as the natural son of Indiana Jones. Nevertheless, it is a great feeling to see the return of Ravenwood.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
5,claudio_carvalho,Dated Hero,6,4 October 2008,"In 1957, a group of Soviet soldiers leaded by the brilliant scientist Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) break into a military base in Nevada seeking a container, bringing the abducted Professor Henry Jones a.k.a. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) to help them. Indiana Jones succeeds in escaping and is accused of communist by the FBI, losing his position in the University. He decides to travel to Europe, but he receives a coded message from his deranged colleague Henry Oxley (John Hurt) sent by his former love Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and delivered by the young motorcyclist Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). Indiana Jones and Mutt travel to Peru and they find a powerful Crystal Skull; but chased by Irina and her men, they have to escape through the woods in a journey full of danger and adventure.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is an entertaining action movie, with the hero of the 80's meeting Marion Ravenwood again. The story is not bad, following the same pattern of the previous adventures. However, the retired Indiana Jones has aged and is dated in the present days and his charm unfortunately has gone. I did not dislike this movie, but I also have not felt anything special for his last adventure. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Indiana Jones e o Reino da Caveira de Cristal"" (""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"")",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
6,kosmasp,Long time coming,8,16 August 2008,"In a couple of years the wait for Indiana Jones IV or better the big delay between Part 3 and 4 won't be an issue anymore. Future generations won't be talking about why they didn't make another Indy, when Harrison was younger. This still doesn't mean that many have waited for so long, that the expectations were probably too high and couldn't be matched.Not that the story will be seen or is any better in a few years. But maybe, just maybe people will see, how much fun it is to watch Harrison Ford play Indiana Jones. No other movie (hero), that copied the Indy formula has the charisma of Mr. Ford. And now he is not too old for that s...! I can understand why people are disappointed then (surely they could've come up with something similar to this a few years earlier, now couldn't they?), but all in all this is meant to be a fun ride! Don't take things to seriously (especially not the ""Fridge"" thing, because I'm pretty sure this wouldn't work like it does in the movie! ;o) ) and just hop in for the ride. There are not so many surprises here, you can see things coming a long way, before they do appear, yes even the ending, although I was stunned that they really went that way, which is also one of the main downfalls of the movie, for many viewers as they stated themselves! Now let's just hope, there will be another one (soon) :o)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
7,classicsoncall,"""If you want to be a good archaeologist, you've got to get out of the library.""",7,22 May 2008,"So I'm sitting there watching this flick and I'm saying to myself - ""What the heck is going on here""? I mean, think about it - does all the action stuff take place within about an eight hour time span? I don't recall any breaks in the story that might have given the characters a chance to recoup from their latest confrontation with disaster. Like Indy (Harrison Ford) walking out of the refrigerator that just got thrown for a country mile in an atomic blast! Really??!! And Mutt (Shia LeBeouf) going toe to toe in a careening sword fight with Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) aboard high speed military vehicles through the jungle! And count 'em, not one, not two, but three monstrous waterfalls, and when it's all over, the intrepid quartet (Indy, Marion, Mutt and Oxley) winds their way into the cave of the Crystal Skull in DRY clothes!!! Talk about your super-heroics, I don't even think Iron Man pulled off anything as exceptional as that! It seems like every movie that comes out now has to be the ULTIMATE in over the top action and mind blowing special effects. The thing is, we've probably reached that pinnacle a few flicks back - ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" comes to mind, and that was five years ago already. I think the Indiana Jones franchise could have been better served by returning to the originality of the first picture in the series, which still remains my favorite. Keep it simple with a definitive mission, and you can mark success by the completion of the original goal.So what do we have here? We have aliens, but not just your run of the mill aliens. You have a melding of the 1986 James Cameron sci-fi ""Aliens"" with the Whitley Strieber inspired, alien abduction creatures from ""Communion"". This was the first time I ever made a connection between the two, but the similarity in skull structure and bearing between the respective characters actually seemed to make sense. That's not to say I'm a proponent of alien abduction stories or 'X-Files' inspired conspiracy theories, but they both got a pretty good work-out in the 'Crystal Skull'.You know what's even more compelling? Harrison Ford pulled this off at the age of sixty six, and God bless her, Karen Allen managed to look pretty good at fifty one as Indy's erstwhile girlfriend and mother of his Mutt-ley son. Which by the way, I never actually did hear him referred to as 'Mutt', but I was probably mesmerized by all those special effects. Say, what was the deal with that rat snake anyway?Look, I don't want to be too harsh on the film; I enjoy a good piece of escapist entertainment as well as the next person. But geez, how about a story that you can follow in between mind blowing action pieces and over the top explosive sequences? Was there even a 'Kingdom' of the Crystal Skull when you come right down to it? You know, I think I was paying attention pretty well, when all of a sudden, I thought I saw a flying saucer!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
8,jboothmillard,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,7,3 June 2008,"It has been 19 years since we last saw the felt hat wearing and whip cracking archaeologist action hero, and this was the anticipated return, from writer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). The first film was brilliant, the sequel was pretty good, the third film is my favourite, and this return is better than the first sequel. He may be ageing, and he may have lost his father Henry Sr. and best friend Marcus Brody, and it may be 1957, the Cold War, instead of World War II, but Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is still a great hero. Basically, Soviet soldiers lead by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) are in Hangar 51 (where the Lost Ark was put) looking for the remains of an alien life form, and Indy's friend 'Mac' George McHale (Ray Winstone) turns against him, obviously Indy gets away though. After returning to his college, now run by Dean Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent) he soon meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), who tells him his colleague Professor 'Ox' Oxley (John Hurt) has disappeared after discovering a Crystal Skull in Peru. Indiana and Mutt are now following all the clues to find the skull, and return it to its proper resting place, where a great gift is to be found on its return. Soon enough, Indy is reunited by former lover, and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, from Raiders), who tells Indy that Matt is his son. All characters do eventually reach the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and just like the Lost Ark it is to end badly for anyone, i.e. the bad guys, sticking around to see the aliens (yes, aliens) appear. Also starring Igor Jijikine as Dovchenko and Ugly Betty's Alan Dale as General Ross. The chase sequences are always gripping, the booby traps and secret passage ways are inventive, and the special effects are quite impressive, but (even though it makes sense it's the 50's), I do wonder why Indiana Jones is dealing with aliens, and not the occult in this film, never-the-less, a great return. Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Indiana Jones was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Very good!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Whew, Indy We Hardly Knew Ye!",2,17 October 2008,"I had high hopes that this film would prove the negative reviewers wrong, and those hopes were enhanced in the first 15 minutes with some spectacular scenes. The one in which Indiana Jones hides in a refrigerator while an atomic bomb goes off nearby is amazing to watch. The special-effects and colors are fantastic. That scene is guaranteed to make your jaw drop.Unfortuntately, after that comes some of the most insulting material a halfway intelligent viewer will hope not to find. One scene and statement after another is either totally implausible or the typical left-wing or occult-promoting voodoo-type nonsense. It's so bad it's embarrassing to watch. This is so typical of (director) Steven Spielberg and his Hollywood cohorts like George Lucas, who never met a conspiracy theory they didn't like, an FBI agent they didn't like, a wise-ass kid they didn't like; an over-the-top action scene in which the bad guys shoot a hundred bullets at the good guy from 10 feet away at never hit him (check the warehouse scene, for an early taste of this), on and on. Also in this film are the other standard Liberalness in which anyone opposing communism is made fun of, although we do get a KGB villainous here. Cate Blanchett, who enjoys playing weird characters like Johnny Depp does, plays a Louise Brooks-hairdo-type Russian agent with the horrible fake accent.Also, the young, obnoxious kid (named ""Mutt"") is played by Shia LeBeouf. Is it my imagination, or is this kid in about every film made the last year or so? He began getting noticed playing a super nice guy, young golfer Francis Ouimet in ""The Greatest Game Ever Played,"" but since then always plays a punk.Even worse, the movie gets more and more stupid as it goes along but, if you're smart you won't annoy yourself by watching the whole two hours. I didn't, and saved myself a lot of aggravation. Ask most viewers: they'll tell you the last third of the film was the worst, really insulting as ""Indiana"" and ""Mutt"" turn into ""Spiderman"" and ""Tarzan"" through the jungle.The ""old"" Indiana Jones movies look like Casablanca and Citizen Kane compared to this garbage. Judging by this film, I expect to see Harrison Ford now doing Viagra commercials soon.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
10,rmax304823,Supersize It.,5,30 August 2015,"The first episode -- I think that's the correct term -- was original, fun, and thrilling. Lo, these many years later, we have Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones in 1957, in the middle of the Cold War, and everything that made the original so enjoyable is here either missing or done to excess.Not just that. In the original, the Nazis were after the Ark of the Covenant. Now, we can all agree that the Nazis were bad guys. I mean, considering the diverse forms taken by their innovative depravity. They deserved to melt at the end.Using the Russians as equally ruthless enemies is a different story and a tactless move. We never fought a war against the USSR. No doubt Stalin and his myrmidons were evil; he killed more Russians than the Germans did in World War II. But ""Russia"" as a whole was never the evil entity that the Nazis were. It's why Ian Fleming changed James Bond's antagonists from SMERSH (the KGB) to SPECTRE (an international terrorist organization).Ford now, that is in 1957, is twenty years older and looks it, at least at the beginning. He seems gradually to regress in age as time passes. He's a part-time tenured professor with a finely appointed office full of souvenirs and assorted archaeological tchochkas. It rivals Margaret Mead's sanctuary in the Queen Ann tower of the American Museum of Natural History. She seemed to OWN it. Not the office -- the whole tower.However, Ford deserves whatever perks he's getting from his university because he speaks and read one thousand, one hundred, and four languages, most of them extinct, some of them never having existed. He's also as spry as any college athlete and this is to serve him well in this adventure.Yet the story, for all the bombastic special effects, doesn't quite reach the stage of ejaculatory inevitability. The object of the pursuit here is not the Ark of the Covenant but a Mayan crystal skull whose function remains unclear. Something to do with power and knowledge and aliens from outer space. When the skull is finally placed in its proper underground setting, things ought to come together. Instead they come apart. There is a great vortex of whirling barn-sized rocks and debris, a lot of noise, and a monstrous shiny UFO emerges from the Guatamalan soil to be replaced by an onrush of roiling water and finally a placid lake. What was it all about? I don't know. Maybe the whole point was the extraordinary use of special effects.Cate Blanchett, a comely and wholly admirable actress of great range, is wasted and turned into a comic villain who dresses in black leather, walks stiffly, is utterly ruthless, and carries a rapier as a prop, a more comical figure than Rosa Kleb. Too bad. Shia LaBeouf is unimpressive except when we first meet him in an imitation of Marlon Brando's Johnny in ""The Wild Ones."" (The kids won't get it.) John Hurt, who was my supporting player in the marvelous ""From the Hip"", is likewise underused as a maniac who discovers the location of the crystal skull. Ford is adequate in the title role. He could phone it in by now.Youngsters should enjoy the heck out of it because they're too young to remember how fresh the original was. Their enjoyment may be mitigated by the evolution of TV commercials and feature films that have shamelessly ripped scenes and techniques from the still-quivering flank of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" They see effects like this every day. You know, recently Hollywood has been producing expensive features that are not only sequels to previous successes, as this one is, but movies that are based on comic book heroes, graphic novels, cartoons, and internet war games like ""Battleship."" I guess that's what happens when you replace studios and their moguls with a board of MBAs whose idea of success is Art with a dollar sign in front of it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
11,Tweekums,Indy goes up against Soviets in the Peruvian Jungle,7,10 December 2017,"It is 1957 and as this film opens Indiana Jones and his friend George ""Mac"" McHale have been captured by a Soviet officer, Colonel Dr Irina Spalko, who wants help stealing an artefact from a warehouse in Area 51. The item appears to be the remains of the 'Roswell Alien'. Indy manages to escape, but not before learning that his 'friend' is actually in the pay of the Soviets. He heads to a nearby village and finds it populated by dummies it is about to be destroyed in a nuclear test! He survives but is suspected of being a Soviet agent by the FBI. After being given a leave of absence from his job he is approached by a young man, known as 'Mutt', with an interesting story; archaeologist Harold Oxley found a crystal skull in Peru before going insane; it is believed that he must have found it in the legendary city of Akator also who make as known as El Dorado. Indy and Mutt head to Peru to search for the skull and the city here they meet some old friends as well as the Soviets who are also after the skull for their own nefarious ends.I'd heard that this film was rather disappointing so put off watching it for some time actually it was quite enjoyable. There is plenty of action from start to finish and even though our protagonists are often in danger it isn't too scary most of the time as there is degree of humour most of the time. There are a handful of 'unpleasant' scenes; the worst being when a couple of villains are killed by giant ants! The action is nicely varied with car chases through the jungle, going over waterfalls in an amphibious car and less than friendly locals. The main characters are pretty good; Harrison Ford shows that he still had what it took to play the adventurous Indiana Jones and Shia LaBeouf was solid as Mutt. There are also fine performances from Cate Blanchett as the villainous Spalko; John Hurt as Oxley; Ray Winstone as Mac and Karen Allen who makes a welcome return to the series as Marion Ravenwood, the romantic interest in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Overall I'd say this is a decent enough adventure with plenty of action and a fun story; I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the original films even if it isn't quite as good.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

13,BA_Harrison,Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Fractured Hip.,5,28 May 2008,"Nearly two decades after The Last Crusade, Harrison Ford (looking almost as decrepit as some of the crumbly corpses that litter his character's archaeological digs) dusts off his fedora and unfurls his bull-whip for another crazy adventure. Aided by Brando-wannabee Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) and joined once again by spunky Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), this caper sees the indestructible Doctor Jones fighting the nasty Russians, who hope to use an ancient alien skull (made from crystal) to give them incredible supernatural powers that will help them win the 'cold war'.With Spielberg once again directing the action, fans of the series can expect plenty of amazing set-pieces and mind-boggling special effects, but shouldn't get their hopes too high: for every incredible scene of entertainment excellence that the bearded wonder delivers, there are several so daft that viewers will choke on their popcorn in disbelief.Adrenaline pumping highs include an exhilarating ride on a jet-propelled sledge, a breathtaking chase through the Amazonian jungle, an attack by over-sized killer ants, and a rapid descent down a disappearing staircase. Depressingly stupid lows include Indy's ludicrous escape from an A-bomb via a lead-lined fridge, the 'not once, not twice, but THREE bloody times' miraculous escape from certain death by waterfall, LaBeouf's plain awful Tarzan impression (complete with primate pals), an ending so lame that it makes one wonder how the hell this particular script got the thumbs up, and a star who is, quite simply, too old for this kind of fare.Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull might never be boring and is always visually impressive (every dollar of the budget is right up there on the screen), but it's a film that ultimately suffers from trying too hard to outdo all that has gone before.6.5 out of 10 for pure entertainment value, but I just can't bring myself to round my rating up to 7, simply because of that damn fridge scene.**EDIT** I just watched the film again and it's worse than I originally thought. I'm lowering my rating to a 5.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
14,moonspinner55,Close Encounters of the Indy Kind...,6,23 May 2008,"Harrison Ford returns to his popular role of Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, archaeologist and professor in 1957 being recruited by the rebellious son of former love Marion Ravenwood to find a colleague and former classmate of Indy's who has been taken prisoner in Peru. The treacherous journey leads Jones along a mythical path to a Mayan temple where he must complete a sacred mission, constantly crossing paths with a female Russkie (and former girlfriend of Stalin!) who covets information and power. Steven Spielberg once again directs these adventures in a rousing, Saturday afternoon matinée style which is, at once, both completely illogical but also a lot of fun. Occasionally, Spielberg's penchant for corny humor lands with a resounding thud--as does a scene of derring-do in the style of ""Tarzan"". Still, it's a tongue-in-cheek macho fantasy which manages to push most of the right buttons for a mass audience, even if its scenario does look a bit familiar (at one point while dashing down spiraling stone steps which are quickly injecting themselves into the ruins, one half expects this gang to morph into the ""National Treasure"" team). Ford, looking rumpled and rugged, does not disappoint in his fourth turn as Jones; he keeps campy humor at bay by playing Indy grounded and low-keyed. Cate Blanchett's Irina Spalko seems to be made out of cast-iron, and her character doesn't make a whole lot of sense (and neither does her exit); narrowly avoiding winking self-amusement, Blanchett has a good time with the silly role and she cuts a nice presence in the fight scenes. Shia LaBeouf plays Jones' protégé with an appealing mix of youthful bravado and wide-eyed amazement, though he seems to have less and less to do once Indy's team grows in numbers. There's a Capraesque final touch of whimsy in the recipe which leaves the crowds smiling. However, this globe-trotting plot is far too complicated, muddied up even further by the over-indulgent special effects--Spielberg's obvious need to continually top himself...not just from sequel to sequel, but from sequence to sequence! Of course it doesn't always have to make sense--and when Spielberg fires up the action, with cars, motorcycles and bullets all whizzing by, who wants to keep a scorecard?--but even the most fantastic treasure hunts need solid ground to stand on. **1/2 from ****",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
15,blanche-2,The Indiana franchise needed to end before this one,7,4 July 2011,"Harrison Ford is again Indiana Jones in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" a 2008 film also starring Shia LaBoeuf, Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen, John Hurt, and Jim Broadbent. This one takes place during the Cold War. A young man brings Indy a coded message from Henry Oxley (Hurt), a colleague of Indy's with a couple of loose screws. Indy and the young man, Mutt (LaBoeuf) head for Peru to find a crystal skull, which Indy then has to return to its rightful place. What he doesn't know is that the Russians, led by Irina (Blanchett) are watching his every move. If Irina gets the skull and returns it, the Russians will gain power that could ruin the rest of the world. Meanwhile, the Russians have Henry.Not to sound too bitter, but it must be great to be an older male in Hollywood and still be able to play leads, a right not given to many women over 60. At 66, Ford looks every bit of it. He may be a little tired but his screen presence never is, and it's always great to see him as Indy. The script here lets all these good actors down, however. This is merely some long action sequences -- clever, exciting ones though they may be -- linked together by a very thin story. If the producers were waiting for the right script before sending Indiana out of college again, they should have waited a little longer.Indiana Jones as played by Ford is one of the great screen characters, and no script can take that away from an audience. It's just sad to see this franchise go from the brilliant ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to this. Sometimes it's the right thing to just leave on a high note.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
16,Quinoa1984,"nothing great, but definitely not at all a disappointment; it's a pure kickback to 50's pulp fiction in popcorn style",7,23 May 2008,"It's taken quite a while for Indiana Jones to come back to the screen- almost as long as it took for Star Wars to return to the prequels- and as such, expectations are high, and it's very possible to be letdown. And on top of this, for months, there have been rumors of aliens involved with the script this time around, which sounds quite implausible. Thank goodness then, as the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls turns out, any and all implausibility not only works, but is actually *welcome* to the proceedings. In the scope of the fourth installment, things are so dependent on a suspension of disbelief that it makes the mind boggle. But aside from the alien concept (not to mention inter-dimensional portals), most of the implausibility is no more or less than the other films, which has the kinds of things that only happen in the cheapest paperback pot boilers and craziest Saturday matinée serials.We see our hero Indiana Jones- now older but still, played by Harrison Ford, with the gusto and ballsy attitude with the fun that comes with playing this character to the max every time around- tossed out from an atomic bomb while in a fridge, driving a car and/or fighting while Shai LeBouf's Mutt Williams fights with Cate Blanchett's Commie/Russian femme fatale with swords, a whole gigantic swarm of man-eating fire-ants, ancient Mayans living in catacombs for God knows how long, and on TOP of this a whole cavalcade of 50s pop culture references and things that made the decade so guiltily American (namely Communists and science fiction with flying saucers). It should be a mess- frankly, some might not be happy with it- but it's this whole assortment of pieces that somehow, under Spielberg's direction, works. Very well.So well, in fact, that I just left logic at the seat behind me following the first five minutes. After this, the director, the writer David Koepp, the stunt men and technicians, Ford and the cool supporting cast (including, very oddly enough, a running gag with John Hurt), can play on the audience to just get soaked up in a story that is strange and convoluted and full of details, and with enough action and goofy bits to keep things always entertaining. In a way some of it works as just being like when a rock band goes out on a reunion tour; we see the familiar faces, some of the familiar beats and themes of father-son bonding, and the delirious thrills of the chase for the prized ""thing"" at the end of the search (which includes, one might add, THREE waterfalls).On the other hand, this same 'reunion' logic sometimes wears a little thin, especially after the somewhat obvious reveal of who the 'son' is (if you've seen Superman Returns you get what I mean), and it does veer on becoming so crazy that it threatens to run off its rugged star off the rails. An in-joke or two also goes only so far as to have a chuckle, if not one that entirely works for the narrative. But aside from that, Spielberg and company revel in this quest for a mythical legend that goes just a step beyond (or back, depending on point of view) from past quests. Then again, there's a good parallel as well the former 'God' items, even with the element of these magnetic, eggplant shaped skulls. When given this much entertainment, there are a couple of moments that spring up to think of such things like ""is there always a quest for knowledge?"" during such a big-action spectacle? Why not - it's certainly not any more or less what it aims to be than Temple of Doom or Last Crusade (if not as wholly satisfying as Crusade it is a step above Doom's annoying personalities). And if it certainly doesn't reach the majestic genre heights of its first feature, it gives enough pleasures for those that have been waiting for so long for another adventure with so many cliffhangers, chases, fights, and implausibilities that might make those old time B-movie makers' heads spin. You'll either like it or not, and I liked it. If not already a fan of the series, however, it might be a wild card in a summer of franchises. A-",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
17,tavm,Fourth Indiana Jones adventure got me way excited at the movies again!,8,2 June 2008,"Okay, I've just read a lot of negative comments concerning this, the fourth Indy adventure directed by Steven Spielberg, executive produced by George Lucas with the story partially credited to him, and starring Harrison Ford as Doctor/Professor Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr. I also read some of the spoilers like that Mutt (Shia LeBeouf) is Marion Ravenwood's (welcome back, Karen Allen!) son (thank goodness I found out about Indy being the father while watching the movie). And, yes, maybe the aliens being revealed at the end was a bit too much into Close Encounters/E.T./even Star Wars territory. And maybe some of the exposition was too much too. For all that, I thoroughly enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull almost as much as the other 3 previous ones, Raiders in particular. Certainly, I loved Indy's subtle reference to a couple of other women he dated after Marion (Kate Capshaw though time-wise in series her romance with Jones happened before Raiders, Alison Doody) and telling her, ""They weren't you!"" after she asked what was wrong with them. Allen herself acquits herself nicely especially when she takes a dive off a cliff over Indy's objections and his admonition not to do that again, ""Yes, dear."" And Spielberg's staging of the chase sequences are the most thrillingly done ever on the movie screen. And having Indy using a snake as a rope to get out of quicksand? Genius, since that moment got me saying, ""He hates snakes!"" with my friend being concerned by my reaction! There's other things that got me excited but let me just say, this was a great adventure to watch in a theatre and if someone wanted to watch this with me, I definitely wouldn't object to a repeat viewing! Oh, and how wonderful to once again hear John Williams' theme again...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Interesting.The film is action packed as Jones once again proves that he can triumph over adversity. Problem is whether or not he can triumph over the writing and plot here.The British guy goes from friend to villain back to friend, etc. It never stops and you really can't get a handle on this guy.Cate Blanchett, as the Russian scientist is good in her part and shows tremendous versatility. The problem that by the end, she becomes almost comical by uttering in a thick Russian accent, ""I want to know, I want to know.""

The famed archaeologist/adventurer Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford)is living the mundane life of a professor at Marshall College when he meets a renegade greaser Mutt Williams(Shia LaBeouf). The young switchblade carrying dropout needs the help of Dr. Jones in the rescue of his mother Marion(Karen Allen)and one of Indy's old friends Professor Oxley(John Hurt). Jones and Mutt travel to Peru in search of a legendary City of Gold and the Crystal Skull of Akator that has mysterious powers. Also in their own search is the Soviets under the lead of Irina Spalko(Cate Blanchett), who would love to have the skull to use its powers in the Cold War. Exciting action sequences and masterful F/X with great photography. What would an Indiana Jones flick be without it? I really enjoyed the opening scene of the teenagers in a hot rod wanting to race with an Army convoy to the tune of Elvis' ""Hound Dog"". The sequence with the large ants is also entertaining. And the waterfall scenes were fantastic. The movie is not the greatest, but no slouch either. It was good to see the new revelations in Dr. Jones' personal life; but I was not too happy with the finale involving the E.T. spaceship.

It is the fourth film in the Indiana Jones franchise, created by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg. Released nineteen years after the previous film, the film acknowledges its star Harrison Ford's age by being set in 1957. It pays tribute to the science fiction B-movies of the era, pitting Indiana Jones against Soviet agents—led by Irina Spalko —for a psychic alien crystal skull. Indiana is aided by his former lover Marion Ravenwood and Mutt Williams.Though the plot elements are certainly familiar, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull still delivers the thrills and Harrison Ford's return in the title role is more than welcome.Ford still has the charisma to reinvent one of the most-beloved characters in screen history.The film isn't bad -- there are a few dazzling sequences, and a couple of good performances -- but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone.Although it carries a certain level of slickness to it, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull shows that although the times have changed - both in the film and for the viewing audience - Indiana Jones hasn't. And that's a problem.There is nothing new in here except entertainment value.That is why this movie franchise should be put into rest.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

But they did and so we end up with a belated Indy film whether we like it or not.And there are lots of bits to like. The action is good, Ford is good and it looks stunning but sadly there are lots of bits to dislike as well. The story is overcomplicated and the film itself is overlong. Le Bouf proves again why he divides opinions and at the end of the day we find ourselves asking why we needed a fourth episode in the series at all.It's a nice film but it could have been a great film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

23,hitchcockthelegend,Life in the old dog yet.,8,23 May 2008,"Indiana Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.So here it is, the fourth instalment of the Indiana Jones series is finally here, one of the most talked about, most anticipated, and most yearned for films is here to hopefully entertain the fans and maybe garner some new ones in the process?? Does it deliver? Well to me it most certainly does, as adventure yarns go, this is a ripper, and although the plot gets lost within the outlandish ideals, the film still emerges as one of the betert popcorn blockbusters of the year. All the chief ingredients that have made the franchise so beloved are crammed in by way of crowd pleasing necessity, and it damn well works, outrageous action sequences perk us up at frequent intervals, deftly self aware comic moments are many, and crucially, the film remains loyal to the heroic good against evil spirit of the franchise.We begin in the Nevada Desert in 1957, and it's through this 50s setting that we come to accept the ageing of the main protagonist, he is after all a mere mortal, a man with a whip and a bit of guts. The 50s was a time of paranoia, spies and dubious cover ups were all the rage, this shines through from the outset here, and putting an aged Indiana Jones in this time frame is nothing short of genius. But enough of the politics, we as fans just want to be entertained, and we are well served here, spooky chambers, mysterious civilisations, tricksy maps, unfathomable codes, creepy crawlies, peril at every turn, and stuntery abound, oh yes it's all here. However, the purists will hate the use of CGI in this, and for sure it does grate during one over extended sequence, but just like it didn't stop Stephen Sommers' The Mummy being a riot, it doesn't harm this picture either, we are after all talking about a popcorn actioner here. Surely going into a film of this type one immediately suspends disbelief? I mean I'm personally going into the cinema to escape for a couple of hours, and Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is just what the doctor ordered, with a lollipop to follow for good behaviour.The cast are a mixed bunch, Ford easily carries off the role as the older Indiana Jones, very aware and with tongue firmly in cheek, he surely has rammed all the pre-negative vibes down the throats of the doom mongers. Shia LaBeouf fits into the series with no problems at all, spunky and witty, he adds the young sparkle needed to off set the aged nature of our hero, and he gets a quite delightful entrance to boot. Ray Winstone is an odd casting choice because his character is very underwritten, if you are going to utilise the big Englishman then give him the reins to take, he's gruff and watchable but it remains a case of wasting talent. Karen Allen joyfully reappears as Marion, and the film takes a significant leap upwards once she arrives, however the character is reduced to playing fourth fiddle in the ensuring shenanigans, and as much as the interplay with Indy still sparkles, you can't help hankering for much more from our Marion. Cate Blanchet is sparky as Irina Spalko but although as our chief villain of the piece she's tough, sexy, and not to be messed with, it's a turn that is never quite fully formed. John Hurt does the best he can with what little the role calls for, whilst Jim Broadbent barely gets time to fill the considerable boots left by Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will divide fans and newcomers alike, but I honestly say without nostalgia rearing its head, that this film is a joy ride to be judged on its own merit. It's difficult to understand some of the venom aimed at this latest instalment, it's not like anything has really changed with the formula, Indiana Jones has always been about fun, nothing more and nothing less, just remember why you fell in love with the franchise in the first place and you will see the makers here have given the fans what they wanted. Perhaps the advent of time and the new technology available has a hindrance value for sure, but although Indy 4 obviously isn't quite the impacting franchise jolt that Bond got with ""Casino Royale"", it's sure as hell shown ""Die Hard 4"" how it should have be done. 8/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
24,Doylenf,Overstuffed action dominates incredible story and Indy's lame one-liners...,5,28 May 2008,"Contrary to what Mr. Spielberg thinks, there is no real McGuffin, and that's just one of the many drawbacks of this new Indy film. Furthermore, it's marred by overstuffed action sequences and Indy's lame one-liners, which becomes obvious after the first ten minutes.When even HARRISON FORD's witty one-liners come across as lame and lifeless (as well as too few and far between), when John Williams' music over the end credits is the only thrilling moment you've really had, you know you're expectations have not been met. This Indy movie tries hard to approximate what went before--and even brings KAREN ALLEN back for a few laughs--but the story is a dismal thing about the desperate search for a Crystal Skull that gives the possessor all the knowledge he'll ever need. Somehow, it fails the McGuffin test that Steven Spielberg thinks he solved.And yet, the world has such a hunger for another Indiana Jones movie that it's cleaning up at the box-office no matter how negative any of the reviews are. I wanted to like it because I miss a good Indiana Jones story as much as anyone--but this isn't it.CATE BLANCHETT remains one-dimensional throughout, although her make-up is good and she looks the part of a Russian adventuress. SHIA LaBEOUF, in his black leather jacket, looks like he stepped out of a James Dean movie but never quite fits into this one. He and Ford have some good byplay but it's all so pat. And then we have JOHN HURT wearing a wild-eyed stare and the year's messiest male hairdo in what might have been an interesting role if we could figure out what he's all about.HARRISON FORD is still afraid of snakes and there's a bonus scene where he has to hang onto one if he wants to get out of quicksand, but other than a few reminders of the Indy of past films, he looks a bit hardened and tired, lacking the zestful playfulness that characterized his earlier way with the part. The script makes concessions to his age, especially from him, to make sure we get the point.Of course, he's not entirely to blame. It's an impossible comic book sort of story that needed a lot of re-working before they decided to go ahead and film it as is. All the story really does is serve as a sort of map on which to plant all the familiar action clichés--explosives, rapid machine-gunning, wild chases through the jungle, man-eating ants, waterfalls that fill the screen from one end to another, and comic book villains that survive every punch with little more than a flinch as Indy swings at them from every direction while he remains relatively unscathed even without using his whip. Despite the strongly realistic sound those punches make, nobody suffers a broken jaw--just minor bruises. The chase scene at the end is almost numbing in its wildly overdone mishaps. There's no satisfaction to be had at the end except for the wind-up that has him tying the knot with Marian Ravenwood after all these years. That and the brilliant but familiar John Williams score that sounds wonderful over the end credits without all the explosive action drowning it out. Better luck next time, Mr. Spielberg. And a better McGuffin. You can cry all the way to the box-office gold.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
25,preppy-3,If you liked the first three you'll probably like this,7,24 June 2008,"Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in semi-retirement is pulled back into action in 1957 by Russians led by evil Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). It has to do with a crystal skull and some artifacts and gold...or something. To be totally honest the plot got so convoluted I was lost! I should start by admitting I'm not a fan of the Indiana Jones movies. I have nothing against Harrison Ford or Spielberg or Lucas. I just found the movies way too violent for what was being advertised as ""family"" movies. The first one was OK; the second was far too violent and dark (even Lucas and Spielberg don't like it); the third I thought was great. This one isn't as good as the third but not as bad as the second. It does have the usual casual violence (three men are shot dead and about five others are burnt to death in the first 20 minutes!) but it worked--more or less.The movie acknowledges that Indy is in his 60s and Ford is actually great in the role. Whenever he smiled I found myself grinning along. Also Karen Allen is back and REALLY having fun as Marion Ravenwood. She has a knowing smirk all through the movie and is just a joy to see. Blanchett is likewise having fun as Spalko. She puts on a black fright wig and completely covers her British accent. The action scenes are fast and furious and go on forever (I mean that in a good way). The special effects are top-notch of course and everything moves quickly. But, all in all, this had a strong sense of deja vu. I felt like I was just seeing the previous adventures all over again. The action was great...but just like the previous ones. Lots of totally unbelievable stunts and roaring away at full speed. Also I did NOT like Shia LeBeouf playing Mutt (how appropriate) Williams. He came off as an annoying jerk. More then once I wanted Indy to knock him out. LeBeouf also isn't that great of an actor.So I sort of liked it. It's quick and furious but the confusing plot and gratuitous violence wore me down. But if you liked the first three you'll probably love this. I give it a 7.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
26,CinemaSerf,"Indy still shines, but this in one adventure too many, methinks...",6,18 December 2019,"The problem with this is that if it was watched in isolation it isn't a half-bad adventure movie. Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf keep the story moving along OK. Unfortunately, it will always be compared with the earlier prequels and it simply doesn't hold a candle to any of them. Karen Allen reprises her role from ""Raiders"" with some considerable joie-de-vivre but Ray Winstone and a ridiculously cast Cate Blanchett as the Ukrainian colonel just don't cut through as we race across the world to track down the origin of a mysterious crystal skull. The plot is almost irrelevant; this is just a vehicle for the star and a pretty charabanc one at that. Can think of a few good uses for the killer ants, though...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
27,poolandrews,Better than I expected.,7,19 January 2011,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is set during 1957 & starts in Nevada as a team of Russian soldiers lead by evil soviet scientist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) shoot their way into secret US military base Area 51, the Soviets hold archaeologist Indian Jones (Harrison Ford) prisoner & force him to help them find a crate containing mysterious remains found at Roswell during 1947. While trying to escape the Soviets Indiana is caught up inside a nuclear explosion but survives by hiding inside a lead lined fridge, the FBI suspect Indiana of helping the Soviets & he is fired form his teaching job. Then Indiana is suddenly contacted by Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who hands him a letter from one of Indiana's old friends Professor Harold Oxley (John Hurt) which sets in motion an adventure to El Dorado in order to find the legendary city of gold & the secret of the kingdom of the crystal skull with Spalko & the Russian army in close pursuit...Directed by Steven Spielberg this was the long awaited fourth Indian Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) & Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) were all made within ten years of each other during the 80's & with such a large gap between those & Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull this was never going to be 80's Indiana Jones action. A lot has changed since 1989, special effects, filmmaking techniques, audience tastes & Harrison Ford has grown old so perhaps it's not surprising that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull can't quite capture the feel, frantic pace & excitement of the earlier films. However, while I consider myself a big fan of the first three Indiana Jones films I actually liked how this turned out, I was expecting some updated modern rubbish & while I am sure many feel that it is, I don't. At a little over two hours the pace is pretty good & I watched it all in one sitting without my interest waning at all which is unusual for me when watching modern films that go on for what seems like forever. There are some truly spectacular action set-pieces that maybe rely a little too much on CGI computer effects & downright silliness but are memorable & very entertaining, I mean I could have done without Mutt swinging on vines like a Monkey but the fight before which takes place on speeding vehicles as they race through a forest are great fun & for every goofy moment there's some great action, stunt work & effects. The story is much better than I had feared, many had told me how silly it was but seriously, come on, why is the story in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull any less silly or unbelievable than those in the previous three Indiana Jones films? Sure, the idea of mixing archaeological action adventure with aliens & Area 51 seems odd but is it any more far removed from reality that the Holy Grail? Than the Ark of the Coveneant? Than magical sacred stones & Indian cults? It's all fantasy after all. The character's are alright, the Russians are a little underdeveloped & Mutt is pretty annoying although luckily he isn't in it as much as I had expected. So overall I really liked this, I liked the story which tries to tie in alien visits, the lost city of gold & evil Soviet scientists for Indiana to fight as well as all the traps, near misses, exotic locations & local mythology that made the other Indiana Jones films so successful.There are plenty of little in-jokes & references to the previous Indiana Jones films here for the fans to spot & smile at, from photo's of previous character's to drawings of the Sankara stones from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom on a blackboard to the Ark of the Covenant in it's wooden box as seen at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I have many call the CGI computer effects poor I actually thought they were really good, the spaceship taking off the destruction & flooding of the temple in particular looked great as did the mushroom cloud caused by the nuclear bomb. The action scenes are good & are the main reason to watch this, there are car chases, fights, shoot-outs & all sorts of traps & dangers including quick sand & flesh eating Ants. The film looks great with nice, bright colourful photography that really show's off some of the impressive locations.With a supposed budget of about $185,000,000 there was no shortage of money spent on this & it show's as it flies from one big budget set-piece to another full of effects & stunts. Mainly filmed in Hawaii & California. The acting is pretty good, Ford has fun with the role while Broadbent, Hurt & Winstone provide good support. Blanchett as the villain is a little wasted while LaBeouf is the weak link & just annoys.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a really enjoyable follow up to a classic 80's action adventure trilogy that have always had fantasy based stories & I honestly don't believe the plot here is any more or less silly or unbelievable than the previous three Indiana Jones films. Full of action, incident & excitement I was very surprised at how much I liked this although maybe I shouldn't have been.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
28,dbborroughs,Enjoyable but rather nonsensical,6,31 May 2008,"(Spoilers and crankiness follows if you don't want to see either skip this review) I don't know what I'm suppose to feel. Its not as bad as the George Lucas three recent Star Wars films, probably because George didn't direct it. Lord knows its as badly plotted. (so much for Lucas as being a storyteller). There are many good characters-which is the reason the film works-and many wasted performances.Maybe I should start again.I saw Indiana Jones 4. Its okay.Just. Ultimately its really nothing special, Actually its like any number of other recent films. I don't think its worth running out to see with the crowds. There really is no stand out sequence or anything to make it anything other than a lesser Indy film (with maybe an edge on Temple of doom-though that has the great opening). I don't know if counts for anything but it put my Dad to sleep.The plot has something to do with crystal skulls and the Soviets and really doesn't make any sense. Thats the problem with the film it makes no sense. The story doesn't progress it moves from ""clever idea"" to ""clever idea"" with no logic real world or its own.A couple of examples of less then logical sense: Opening with a small band of soviets breaking into the army base where all of the treasures (ie ark of the covenant from Raiders) are stored. No one is there other than some guys at the front gate (Huh?). We hear announcements of weapons tests but see no men other than the guys at the front gate. Where is everyone? Once in the warehouse they then have to resort to some mumbo jumbo to find a weird mummy- when it would have been so much simpler just to check the logs in an office.They find the case and a shoot out occurs which starts in the daylight and ends in the dead of night.(The passage of time here makes zero sense).Another point at which the film ceases to make sense-watch the sequence that has Indy reading a cryptic letter from Ox- He can't read it-he can read it-he knows what it means then he doesn't-then he does again- then he doesn't-it jumps from second to second as the sequence requires him to be smart or stupid. Its too much.For lack of a better term the rest of the plot is simplistically stupid (which is much nicer then what I originally called it) taking twists and turns that make no sense-we go from one side of South America to the other for no good reason other to have a ""cool sequence"".I just stopped caring what was happening at which point the film suddenly got so much better. (Oh pretty pictures and an occasional witty line) The action of the film lacks snap. there is no sense of danger, it all feels as if its being done at half speed.At no point did I think anyone was in danger, ever . This is a huge weakness, especially when you compare it to its movie theater competition from a week earlier, Prince Caspian.In Caspian you feel danger from the opening seconds, even when you know the story,Indy in comparison looks even more anemic. Its one thing to know your hero isn't going to die, but its another to know he's not going to even get a paper cut even during wildly dangerous escapades.(I'm of the suspicion that the action pieces were not picked for real adventure rather for playability in the tie in video game.) I suppose it might have been better if I didn't start a running list of movies stolen from (Quatermass and the Pit, Wild One,The speeder bike from Jedi,The first of the recent Mummy films which was melded with Naked Jungle, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Congo, and on and on). Is any part of this film not borrowed from somewhere else? The cast is good, though Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent and to some degree Cate Blanchett aren't really given much to do. Blanchett's part essentially requires her to be a proto-dominatrix which is fine but she is never threatening she's more amusing than scary.(give me the Nazis). Shia LaBeouf is bland. A good part of it is the fact the part is suppose to be Indy Jr and once that was set up they never filled in the lines or the promise. Of course it doesn't help that as an actor he carries almost no weight on screen. I'm bitching but he's not bad-I just get ill at the thought of the series continuing with him in the lead, where would you go with it? More importantly why would we care when Indy is still viable even if he's a step slower? Lets face it Indy is THE MAN, Shia's Mutt is a pale imitation.I really think that had this not been an Indiana Jones film no one would have paid it any mind and it would have played better all around. Its not bad, any more than the Tomb Raider films are bad. Its just not deserving of being called an Indian Jones film nor even an event film. Its an okay but unremarkable action film that is getting a bye (by other people) because of its pedigree. I mean the earlier Indy films would have worked pretty much if you changed the names and had them not be an Indian Jones film, this film would still work, but ultimately it would deflate in to a movie that would be forgotten until it got into a heavy rotation on cable stations like USA or TBS.For me its a 6.5 out of 10. Its an enjoyable but exceedingly stupid movie.Now could we please get a real adventure-sans Indy Jr next time?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
29,Bunuel1976,"Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull (Steven Spielberg, 2008) ***",7,25 May 2008,"Back in early 1985, we were the very first household in our neighborhood to own a VCR and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) was the very first VHS we got hold of to give the then state-of-the-art machine a workout; similarly, the “Making of” featurettes shown on TV around the time of the local theatrical release of INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984) were the very first of their kind that I ever did see. Therefore, the character of Indiana Jones can be considered something of a milestone in my life as a long-term movie buff. Obviously, by the time the third outing came out, I was old enough to go to a theatrical screening of it.Cut to almost two decades later and we now have the fourth adventure of the iconic adventurer-professor. Frankly, I haven’t watched the earlier trilogy in ages (even though I did acquire them fairly recently on DVD-R) and it’s no secret that the last two entries lagged behind their truly exhilarating predecessor. Leading man Harrison Ford is now practically an incredible 65 years of age (and you thought Roger Moore was being ridiculous in still portraying James Bond at 57?) and, admirably, the film-makers have not chosen to go the route of making him all up cosmetically in order to disguise this fact. Even so, they do counter this by introducing the character of his long-lost son (Shia LaBeouf) who, in the very last scene, is practically thrust into the audience’s lap as being his logical (not to mention natural) successor.In movies of this kind, describing the plot with any thoroughness is about as sensible as having the lead actors perform each and every stunt themselves, but this fourth outing truly seems to have thrown in everything but the kitchen sink into the heady brew': hidden Inca treasure defended by karate-chopping Asian zombies; the mythical lost city of El Dorado; the 1947 Roswell findings; the testing of the atom bomb; the Anti-Communist pruning of the U.S.A.; a deadly attack from an interminable colony of ants; and, it goes without saying, copious in-jokes to earlier films: from two early Charlton Heston vehicles – obviously enough THE NAKED JUNGLE (1954) and SECRET OF THE INCAS (1954) – to such controversial contemporary items (the film being set in 1957) as THE WILD ONE (1953) and BLACKBOARD JUNGLE (1955)! A danger-fraught roller-coaster ride is only thrilling if the spectator cares for the people on board and the tension that some of them can get seriously hurt at any given moment is palpable – in this respect, this newest Indiana Jones episode is a mixed bag: Harrison Ford is charismatic and resourceful enough here but, as I intimated before, he is occasionally overshadowed by LaBeouf’s own antics; the major female roles go to Cate Blanchett as an ambitious Russian scientist (sporting a dubious, occasionally unintelligible accent and a Cyd Charisse hairdo which couldn’t help but remind me of the Rouben Mamoulian/Fred Astaire musical remake of NINOTCHKA [1939] i.e. SILK STOCKINGS which, as it happens, was itself released in 1957!) and Karen Allen – returning, 26 years after the fact, as the character she originally played in the first Indy film (she is a welcome presence and looks good for her age but her part is woefully underwritten here and requires little of her but fawning over our indomitable superhero); the supporting cast is rounded out by John Hurt (as a half-crazy archaeologist who holds the key to the whole messy expedition), Ray Winstone (fun but hardly stretched by his role of Indy’s two-faced partner) and a wasted Jim Broadbent (standing in for the late Denholm Elliott as Indy’s sympathetic academic superior). Being set squarely during the Cold War, it was to be expected that Indy faces up to the Russians in this one but, Blanchett excepted, they are, alas, a highly uninteresting lot as depicted here.Of course, it wouldn’t be an Indiana Jones movie without John Williams’ instantly recognizable musical theme and backing but, under the circumstances, he didn’t have to overly rely on it in his score for this one. Director Steven Spielberg and producer/co-writer George Lucas clearly show that they still know how best to entertain undiscriminating masses but, being aware that the film took so long to get made because they couldn’t settle on the right script, it’s small wonder that the one they eventually ended up with is so rambling and convoluted as to be unsatisfying anyway. Having read several online forum posts about the film since I’ve seen it, however, this fourth film strikes me as being as much a disappointment to hardcore fans of the series as the fourth…er…first STAR WARS episode was but, while I understand some of their complaints, I think it’s silly to assert that they were let down by it because of its over-reliance on CGI effects (as if Hollywood’s wealthiest film-makers were ever going to skimp on utilizing the newest computer-generated visual effects?!) and its rampant implausibilities (the flying fridge and the triple rapids descent stunts seemed to be real thorns in their side)! I’m not saying I completely suspended my disbelief throughout the film or that everything made a great deal of sense (particularly the other worldly climax)…but, for cryin’ out loud, it’s a popcorn-popping, anything-goes blockbuster you’ve been watching. What else did you expect?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
30,lastliberal,Rumble in the Jungle,8,22 May 2008,"I have to say that I went into this film with a great deal of trepidation having just see Shia LaBeouf in transformers, where I was underwhelmed by his acting.He really came through here and exceeded all my expectations. he was an important member of the cast and held his own with humor and action.Of course, I went to see Harrison Ford and Karen Allen. Despite his age, and some slow movement in the first half of the film, he was fantastic and show why Indy will always be Harrison. Sorry, Shia, the hat will not pass to you. Allen was just so perfect as Indy's ex and there was good chemistry between them.Ah, Cate Blanchett. I so expected a Rosa Klebb character, but we got a character reminiscent of those black clad she-devils in movies like SS Camp 5: Women's Hell. There never was a trace of emotion on her face, but could she clamp those knees together to squash that ant. Whew! The excitement was tremendous once the film got going, and the chase through the jungle was edge-of-your-seat heart-pounding action. It didn't stop there, but to tell more would be cheating.Indy's fear of snakes was used very effectively to generate laughs, and you could guess the ending, even though it was amazing, if you know anything at all about the myths surrounding the crystal skulls.You will not be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
31,zardoz-13,Nowhere Near As Entertaining as the Earlier Indy Epics,6,28 May 2008,"The less you think about director Steven Spielberg's predictable new adventure opus ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" the more you'll enjoy it. Harrison Ford dons his brown, snap-brim fedora after a 19 year hiatus, while Karen Allen emerges from a 27 year exile to team up with him again. Indeed, the Marion and Indy relationship furnishes ""The Crystal Skull"" with its most memorable moments. The sixty-five year old Ford still knows how to throw a punch, but the fourth entry in the franchise that began back in 1981 with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" lacks punch.Indiana Jones tangled with the Nazis in ""Raiders"" and ""The Last Crusade,"" but ""The Crystal Skull"" pits him against the Communists. Actually, the Commies make pretty bland adversaries compared with Hitler's henchmen. The action unfolds in 1957, and Dwight Eisenhower sits in the White House. America is waging the Cold War with the Soviet Union as our mortal enemy. Everybody in America fears that Communists are lurking under their beds thanks to the notorious Senator Joseph McCarthy and his Red Scare.The curtain rises with Soviet commandos masquerading as U.S. Army troops. They wipe out the guards at Area 51 in Nevada so they can break into Hanger 51. Colonel Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett of ""Elizabeth"" in a black Louise Brooks hairdo) is the Kremlin's fair-haired girl and a three-time recipient of the Order of Lenin. Moreover, she has abducted Indy. It seems that Indy had examined the paranormal contents of an ultra-secret crate some years ago that contained a dead alien. The Soviets escort Indy at gunpoint into the cavernous Hanger 51. They force him to locate that crate among literally thousands of crates. (Anybody remember the ending of ""Raiders"" when Uncle Sam stashed the Ark in a huge warehouse?) Naturally, our hero manages to escape from the Soviets, but he stumbles into a fake town in the desert where an atomic blast is set to detonate. Indy pulls a genuine MacGyver to get his fat out of the fire. When he returns to Marshall University, he learns that FBI has him under surveillance. Uncle Sam suspects that Indy has been collaborating with the Kremlin. Into these half-baked hysterics rumbles Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf of ""Transformers"") decked out like Marlon Brando from ""The Wild One"" on a motorcycle. He helps Indy elude the KGB at Marshall College where our hero teaches archeology. Afterward, Spielberg and his scenarists plunge our heroes into the steamy jungles of Peru with Commies hot on their heels, and the search commences for the occult powers that Spalko wants to harness for the Kremlin with the Crystal Skull.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" qualifies as juvenile hokum. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" were white-knuckled, high-octane thrillers with terrific 'what if' premises. ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" bolstered largely by Sean Connery, was serviceable. ""Crystal Skull"" pales by comparison. Number four lacks both the adversaries and the spectacle that fueled the first three. ""Raiders"" had the Ark of the Covenant; ""Temple of Doom"" dealt with human sacrifice; and ""The Last Crusade"" concerned the Holy Grail. ""Jurassic Park"" scenarist David Koepp has done little more than recycle standard-issue Indiana Jones clichés and conventions in a by-the-numbers storyline about life from another galaxy. Worse, Koepp slows down the action repeatedly so that our hero can spout loads of archaeological gibberish that make sense only to him.""The Crystal Skull"" suffers from two problems. First, the Cate Blanchett villain poses a minimal threat to Indy. Mind you, Blanchett gives her usual top-notch performance, but villainous Irina Spalko amounts to little more than a tough-talking version of the Natasha character in ""The Rocky & Bullwinkle Cartoon Show."" For the record, Natasha was the female half of Boris and Natasha Badenov who conducted espionage in America for the Kremlin. In other words, Indy's chief adversary is not to be taken seriously. Spalko is nowhere as menacing as the ""Temple of Doom"" villain who tore the hearts from his victim's chests with his bare fists.Second, the action is rather humdrum. The highlight of the motorcycle chase at Marshall College occurs when Mutt lays down his bike and Jones and he slide underneath several study tables in the library. A species of cannibal insects in South America threaten our heroes, but these critters appear lightweight compared with the flesh-eating scarabs in the 1999 Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" movie. The helter-skelter ride that our heroes take over three water falls in an amphibious jeep is tame compared with Indy's plunge from an aircraft in an inflatable raft that carried him down mountain and into a boiling river in ""Temple of Doom."" As usual, the villains are lousy shots. The best stunts occur in the Hanger 51 scene when Indy cracks his bullwhip to affect his escape. The sword fight a la ""The Legend of Zorro"" between Irina and Mutt on two vehicles careening through the jungle is a yawner.The comic byplay between Indy and his cohorts about his age generates more laughs than the implausible and obviously ersatz stunts evoke authenticity and excitement. Virtually everything in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" has been done before with more verve by Spielberg in early ""Indy"" epics or in movies like ""The Mummy,"" ""Stargate,"" and ""Apocalypto."" Altogether, Harrison Ford looks as dynamic as ever, but ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" looks as ludicrous as the creature feature, science fiction sagas that it celebrates with a wink and a nod.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
32,Boba_Fett1138,"No, it's not the best one out of the series but it's good quality entertainment on its own right.",8,23 May 2008,"Of course if this wasn't a Spielberg movie and this wasn't the longest most anticipated movie sequel of all time and if the Indiana Jones character was a completely new one to the world, very little people would complain about this movie and actually without doubt call it one of the most entertaining movies of this decade. But no, understandably so, expectations for this movie were high and Indiana Jones is part of many people's childhood and when expectations are high, movies very rarely satisfy completely.Of course I also grew up with the Indiana Jones franchise but I didn't expect from this movie to be just as good and entertaining as any of the previous 3 entries. It was probably because of this that I simply enjoyed this movie for what it was.And the movie of course is of very high quality. Not only visually with its effects and settings but also the stunts. It's true that at times the movie goes over-the-top with its action but lets say for 90% of the time the action is just as good and exciting as was the case in the previous Indiana Jones movies. Especially the jungle chase is right up there with the Nazi-desert fight out of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" and truck chase from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Also the cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is stunning and seems to suit the series very well. Yes, perhaps it's a bit too dark though in places but I think this has more to do with the overall atmosphere and story of the movie.Bit of a problem with the movie though is its nostalgic value. It can't stop making references to previous Indiana Jones entries which at times makes this movie feel like an homage to the good old days was something completely new and hot. I don't know, perhaps the cast and crew had a bit too much fun reliving the old days.Possibly the story of this movie is the leas interesting out of the 4 Indiana Jones movie. It doesn't mean it's all too bad though but it prevents the movie from being among the best or most entertaining ones out of the series. I was also a bit worried that there would be no Nazi's in this movie (Nazi's in an Indiana Jones movie = always a good movie) but basically when you replace the commies with Nazi's and place this movie in the '40's instead of the '60's, you would still have the same movie, so it really isn't any problem or complained.Harrison Ford's age also isn't a problem. I mean, who wouldn't want to look like him like he does at the age of 65? It feels as if he never had been away and he still knows how to play and handle the character. The fact that Karen Allen also reprises her role from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is nice but it makes me wonder if it was truly necessary. After all, Indy always had a different girl in each movie. Perhaps it can be seen as an indication that Ford wouldn't return as Indy again and is back to the girl he loved the most and is going to retire with. There of course are also some fresh additions to the cast. Cate Blanchett plays a fine main villain and it makes me root for more female main villain roles in Hollywood movies. Shia LaBeouf once again shows why he is considered a great new Hollywood talent, who can already handle big Hollywood movies. Ray Winstone, John Hurt and Jim Broadbent, among others, are other new additions and they are welcome ones.The movie shows that there is still lots of life and potential with the Indiana Jones franchise. I would say lets do one more movie with Harrison Ford and then pass on the whip and fedora to Shia LaBeouf for a whole new series of movies.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

34,neil-476,"Well, what did you expect?",8,28 May 2008,"Let's get one thing straight right from the start - Raiders of the Lost Ark is not the greatest movie in the history of the world ever. There. I've said it.It's pretty good, mind, but rooted as it is in lowest common denominator pulp serials, it's inherently no better than they are - it's simply glossier.But it was an inspirational piece, catering to nostalgic fondness for those serials, introducing a witty script, state of the art (for the time) special effects and, most of all, a protagonist who was weary, put upon, battered and bruised, yet always resourceful and passionate about his subject.The good news is that the Doctor is in - the Indy in number 4 is very recognisably the same Indy from the earlier films - a little more grizzled and lined, to be sure, but still the same man.And the story is the same story as Raiders - Indy and a bunch of depraved military hardasses are in pursuit of the same mystic artefact which, ultimately, proves the undoing of said baddies. Come to think about it, it's the same story as Last Crusade, too.But the story worked well enough the previous times to work again here, and there's enough stage dressing to take your attention away from the most obvious similarities.The supporting cast are interesting if not always used as one might expect them to be - Jim Broadbent and John Hurt take over the functions of academic colleague and co-adventurer, discharged in earlier films by Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies. Hurt's role is a bit of a puzzle in more ways than several. Shia LaBoeuf continues to challenge those who wish to pronounce his name correctly (damned if I know), and plays a retread of his character in Transformers albeit with an ill-judged visual nod to Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones. His agent needs to find roles to stretch him a bit more. And it was a joy to see Karen Allen reprise Marion Ravenwood, albeit there are moments when you wonder why she is playing like a gleeful simpleton.The jungle chase sequence, to these old eyes, was as well done as anything in the previous movies.I sometimes found the sound unhelpful, with important dialogue being lost beneath background noises.The cinema was full, and the impression I got was of enjoyment across the board.It's an Indiana Jones movie, folks - not fine art, just simple escapist nonsense. Exactly like the previous three.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
35,evanston_dad,"Please Stop, Before Indiana Jones Breaks a Hip",4,16 June 2008,"The first film in the Indiana Jones series to impress me with its awfulness.Spielberg, Lucas and company should be able to crank out good Indiana Jones movies in their sleep by now, since all they have to do is stick to a well-tested formula. Well, they cranked this one out all right, and they definitely did it while asleep, but the formula got lost along the way.The filmmakers have crafted a stupid sci-fi plot this time around, having to do with alien visitors and flying saucers, and the film is full of 1950s movie homages. Unfortunately for us, it's also full of homages to past Indiana Jones films, and other Spielberg/Lucas films, so that the movie never stops being self-referential long enough to entertain us with a good story. Instead, it's full of quite bad CGI effects and painful dialogue that just lies on the floor like a dead cat. Harrison Ford has become perhaps the most charmless actor working today, and he looks like he can barely be bothered to read his lines most of the time. Spielberg is clearly going through the motions as well -- there's no energy or pep to this film. One wonders why anyone felt the need to make this fourth installment if they weren't going to put any more effort than this into it.I almost fell asleep on a number of occasions. The only thing that kept me awake was the promise of seeing Cate Blanchett storm back on to the screen, dragging her Boris and Natasha Russian accent along behind her.

36,ferguson-6,The Space between Space,6,24 May 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's fun and nostalgic to see Harrison Ford back in his wheelhouse as Indy. Obviously Lucas and Spielberg enjoyed themselves as well. While it is an entertaining ride, don't think for a second this one is anywhere near the classic level of the first and third in the series.Somewhat of a mixture of Caddyshack, American Graffiti, Bullwinkle, Back to the Future and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, this film has many over the top moments which take it a bit out of the realistic flair that we grew up expecting from the Indy series. Once again, Ford does a nice job with the character and his Dr. Henry Jones, jr is one of the true icons of American film history.Nice to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion, Indy's long time love interest. Of course, she is re-introduced through a plot twist involving the ""it"" actor of the moment, Shia LaBeouf. Cate Blanchett plays a twist on Natasha from Bullwinkle and I really got a kick out of the fact that after all of the action sequences, she never had a messed up head of hair or a dirty uniform! Sadly, the usually great John Hurt is wasted in his role and Ray Winstone is effective enough in his double/triple agent role.Any fan of the series will be at least a bit taken aback by the over the top action sequences and special effects, but the charm and mystique of Ford and his quest allow us to overlook the disappointments and just enjoy it for what it is ... a very cool character with an awesome theme song.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The so-called magic surrounding this skull is hokey at best but the film is still action packed with witty sense of humour. Steven Spielberg delivers despite that this is the weakest entry to the franchise. Part of the problem is that the third act is hooky. It almost seems as if Spielberg inserted Close Encounters of the Third Kind into the third act and it really doesn't payoff. Harrison Ford has aged but Jones can still crack the whip. Shia LaBeouf plays his son Mutt Williams who appears as a refugee from Rebel Without a Cause or The Wild One. Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood, Indy's love interests from Raiders of the Lost Ark. She is also Mutt's mother. Cate Blanchett is a superb actress of many faces and personas so it is interesting to see her role as the agent leading the Russians. She does have her skill that seems to be nearly a cut above the action. Ray Winstone seems positioned on both sides and Jones is unable to trust him. He is a balancing act of truth and betrayal.

40,Aaron1375,"Indiana Jones is back and age has caught up with him, but that is not the films undoing.",6,26 May 2008,"I really was looking forward to seeing Indiana Jones on the big screen again as it was far to long in between installments as when this film came out it had been nearly 20 years since the last film. While I did not hate this one like a lot of people did, I was not super happy about it either. This is the weakest of the Indiana Jones films by far, as I would say this one falls below the previous weak link The Temple of Doom. Indiana is back, unfortunately his father is not as they have made Connery's character a no show by killing him off. Granted, Connery had retired from film making when they made this one, it still is a bummer they could not coax him out of retirement for a little scene. Do not worry as they have Shia in this one to take up the slack, and if you read this as sarcastic you are correct. Nothing against the guy, but I did not think he fit in this movie at all. Well Indiana is facing off against the Russians in this one as the Nazi's which are the better villains are no longer around in the time period this movie takes place in. You get to see a very nice opening scene in a warehouse that gets a bit to extreme at the end, then Indiana is suspected of being a Russian spy or something. A kid (Shia) named Mutt comes into play and it is not to long before Indiana is in his elements, jungles and tombs. He is also completely out of his element as there are aliens introduced which just did not work and I have to think this was squarely Lucas' idea. I mean the film had some really good moments like the chase through the jungles, the ants and the scene with the river, but it was a bit to hooky in places too. Just an uneven film to be sure as at times it felt like Indiana Jones, while at others it felt nothing like Indiana. I think they are actually planning another movie and one has to wonder where was Harrison Ford's and company urge to do these movies when he was younger after the 1989 Last Crusade movie? Seriously, he could have made two or three Indiana movies and had him retire gracefully, now it looks like he is clinging to his whip and unwilling to let it go.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
41,Wuchakk,Second best of the 4-movie series,7,28 October 2017,"RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" takes place in 1957 when Jones (Harrison Ford) teams-up with a greaser teen (Shia LaBeouf) to thwart a Soviet plot to unearth the secret behind alien-looking artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls. Cate Blanchett plays the staunch Russian leader while Ray Winstone appears as Indiana's dubious partner. John Hurt plays a demented professor while Karen Allen returns as Marion from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981).While none of the three sequels (including the 1984 prequel ""Temple of Doom"") match the greatness of ""Raiders,"" this is easily the best of 'em. ""Last Crusade"" (1989) was decent, but it borrowed too heavily from ""Raiders"" and was unable to match it, let alone improve upon it; not to mention it included the cartoonish-ness of ""Temple."" ""Crystal Skull"" blazes its own path, taking place 19 years after the events in the previous movie. Everything reflects the time period of the mid-to-late 50s: nuclear bomb testing, greasers, Elvis-inspired rock 'n' roll and the obsession with extraterrestrial visitation.The globetrotting spans from the wastelands of Nevada to the Northeast USA to Peru and, lastly, the jungles of the Amazon. The first half is the best part while the last hour is overblown with overkill CGI, but still more entertaining than the climaxes of ""Temple"" and ""Last Crusade."" The film bends over backward to entertain. Jones & Mutt (Labeouf) make a capable & amusing team and it's great to see the spry Marion again (Karen has maintained her sweet figure).

42,zetes,"Quite good, but I could have done without all the computer animation",8,25 May 2008,"A tad disappointing, but that can only be expected. You had to have guessed that Spielberg and Lucas would populate a modern Indiana Jones movie with today's special effects, and CGI seems so at odds with the first three films it can't help but harm it. It certainly does. Each of the Indy movies includes a sequence where the characters encounter a swarm of disgusting creepy-crawlies, with snakes, bugs and rats in the first three films. I won't ruin what pops up here, but whatever it is it's all CGI, and it almost made me weep. The sequence itself is actually pretty cool, but I can't even imagine how much cooler it'd be if the things were real. CGI will always look like a cartoon. Even stop-motion feels more real. So that's my biggest gripe with the movie. Aside from it, I found the movie a joy to watch. Yes, Ford's advanced age does take a little spark out of Indiana Jones, but not too much. He's still a tough S.O.B. This time his enemies are Russian spies, in particular Cate Blanchett as a psychic soldier looking for extra-terrestrial power. Karen Allen returns, the first time I've seen her in forever, and Shia LeBouf plays her son. I, for one, like LeBouf as an actor, and I liked him a lot here. If any actor had a lot of potential to harm the film, it was him, but he handles it perfectly. The other two major players, John Hurt and Ray Winstone, unfortunately add little to the movie, maybe even detract a little from it, and you miss all of Indy's other sidekicks. Come on, John Rhys-Davies is still going strong. He was in the Lord of the Rings movies, after all, and it would have been awesome to see him come back. The action sequences are still a lot of fun, with the one major exception of a Tarzan bit, where LeBouf swings through the jungle on vines, accompanied by awful-looking CGI monkeys. The chase with LeBouf and Ford on the motorcycle was my favorite part of the movie, but I also loved Indy finding himself in a nuclear test zone and the obligatory car chase (kind of fake-looking, but just as much so as some of the back-projected sequences in the first three movies). They really should never have stopped with The Last Crusade. I'd like to imagine three or so of Spielberg's duds replaced by proper Indiana Jones movies. We never let go of Bond, so why should we let go of Indy?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
43,trashgang,why this cash in?,3,10 August 2009,"People who know me will be surprised that I am giving a comment on a major movie and even one that hasn't anything to do with horror. While I was on vacation I watched this one with my girlfriend. You know what I mean. After a whole day quality time with the kids at the swimming pool you just want to lay down and have a beer and some nacho's together with the one you love. Especially when you are on holiday. We were lucky, it never rained so we could do what we had planned. After a year of work it's normal that you go to another country, and the easy part is that you can buy anything now in Europe without going to an exchange office. Long live the Euro I guess. But we are back now on the production line. Oh yeah, did i tell you something about the movie? Stupid storyline, boring, and a promotion of 2 hours of CGI.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
44,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,3,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones has lost all the charm which had endeared it to fans, and looked more like Indy learning a tip or two from Nic Cage's Ben Gates in solving puzzle after puzzle, each so obviously fabricated, that it leads from one action sequence to another. And these action sequences were lazily designed, each without putting our hero in grave danger enough to hang you on the edge of your seat. You'll know exactly when and how he's going to make his great escape, and many action set pieces here will make you scream silently, ""what's the point?"", with every animal and insect from the animal kingdom making an appearance. Not to mention too that the sequences were haphazardly delivered no thanks to poor editing, teleporting our hero from one scene to the next, surviving even the motherload of all weapons - an atomic bomb.Indy's no Superman, but he's made out to be indestructible here, in childish terms, right from the start when he stood to admire the mushroom cloud or was able to dodge bullets fired by professional soldiers using automatic weapons from all directions at the same time. Spielberg and Lucas sprinkled so much fairy dust on him, that even his fedora has magical powers to appear and disappear at will or when it's inconvenient, and I'd buy me one of those bunker refrigerators too. Both filmmakers also can't resist putting their past glories into the movie like a kind of one-upmanship, with Lucas wanting to remind everyone about the forest chase sequence he did in Return of the Jedi complete with lightsabre battles if he could get away with it, and Spielberg reminiscing his good old days with ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which ultimately destroyed everything Indy about Indiana Jones. He's now Fox ""Ben Gates"" Mulder, who wants to believe because the truth is out there unravelled by a friend.If I can describe this movie in one word, it's Lazy. Laziness at all angles. Harrison Ford might be too old to do all the stunts required in the movie, but it's lazy when you can distinguish every shot that he was replaced by a stunt double. The special effects were poured down left right and center, and were unimpressive to begin with, serving no purpose other than trying its best to wow a modern audience so jaded with such attempts at beautifying generic backdrops, or to try and disguise scenes so obviously shot in a soundstage. Lazy in having a score that was lacklustre and playing ad-nausem. Lazy in coming up with half-baked jokes uttered by almost everyone. And laziness in trying to connect everyone together in dotted line relationships, some drawing to unseen pasts and conveniently linked together through a line of dialogue.Laziness in coming up with bland, uninteresting supporting characters. Harrison Ford returns as a reinvented Indiana Jones Version II, and there's more than one Harry here. Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood just to bicker some more, and Shia LaBeouf just played what he has been playing all this while in Transformers and Disturbia. Spielberg even toyed the idea of passing on the franchise baton to LaBeouf's Mutt Williams (yep, get the doggie name joke yet?), whatever for, I do not know, and I reckon the franchise will go down the Highlander way if it continues in that direction. Ray Winstone, John Hurt and Jim Broadbent were pedestrian, and Cate Blanchett obviously has to realize a Chigurh haircut doesn't suit her, and neither does her villainous character, which can waltz into anyone's list of badly constructed movie villains.And it's an Indy trait too that it has some of the dumbest villains ever, since they all succumb to their own undoing as they personify the basic evils of man's greed for power, money and monkey skulls, but villains dispatched here takes the cake. The ultimate laziness in the movie, is the design of the titular bone structure. I could've sworn the Alien Mother Queen could have made an appearance, and still won't look out of place. Worst of all, and I'd give the Worst Prop of the Year award to it, was that the skull was made of cheap see-through plastic, and stuffed with even more cheap, transparent plastic bags inside it to make it look like brain matter, although all the actors would try to make you believe they're made of Swarovski. Indiana Jones may be back and it started off quite promisingly with winks at the earlier movies, but it's a yawnfest with a storyline that goes nowhere, and generic action sequences poorly designed in a rush for time. I have no doubt it'll make its gazillions at the box office, but just give me the original trilogy in a box set, and I'd try to forget this nightmare ever existed. It should have stopped at the Last Crusade, and not get tempted by the lure of more greenback.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
45,Mr-Fusion,Twenty years . . . for this?,4,20 February 2015,"There's a laziness to ""Crystal Skull"" that induces more eye-rolls than cheers. A little too much winking at the audience, none of the verve of the original movies. Makes it hard to believe that it took so long to come up with such a self-satisfied movie that lacks the franchise's spark.The first 45 minutes aren't bad. The opening is classic Indiana Jones (his wit know-how), especially the mystery in the warehouse. And the following action scene is pretty cool. The man in the hat is back. Even the fridge scene - unbelievably dumb as it is - you just go with it.But then it just wanders aimlessly. Blanchett's good, but Spalko is such a lame villain. Then we're in for some lifeless action in the jungle (ugh, LaBeouf and the monkeys), contrived family comedy, Marion gets shoehorned into the movie; it just takes a breezy Sunday drive over a cliff. And there's no payoff here. That wedding was a forced formality. Credit where it's due, for all the drubbing ""Temple of Doom"" has taken, it had least had a satisfying ending. ""Skull"" just peters out.This should have been the swan song, not some limp outing. 4/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
46,siderite,"What goes up, must come down",7,23 September 2008,"If you take the marketeering glee that the people doing Indiana Jones 2 had and you mix it with a bit of the nostalgia in IJ3, you stir in a bit of aliens and you drop the quality to about a half, you get The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.I mean, what the hell? The ideas were terribly old, obvious and hard to believe all in the same time. I would have expected great feats of intelligence and archaeological knowledge from Harrison Ford's character, some buffoonery from his part while he tries to act tough, while his son does all the work, and some well deserved irony for the first 3 (especially the last two) parts of the series. But no, they took it to the next level of moronness (is that a word?) they beefed up the special effects and they left no room for any script. Not even Ford could save this one.As adventure movies go, this one was just below average, but compared to the first Indiana and the spirit of the character, it was a bad movie. Better than nothing, though.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
47,JamesHitchcock,Well-made and enjoyable popcorn movie,6,20 June 2008,"If one needs evidence that Hollywood is running out of ideas for new films, one only needs to look at the various attempts which have been made in recent years to revive some of the most successful action franchises of the seventies and eighties. This trend started with George Lucas's three ""Star Wars"" prequels, and we have also seen a new ""Superman"" and two recent additions to the ""Batman"" canon. Sometimes the original stars are brought back to play roles they created twenty or thirty years ago; at the age of sixty-something Sylvester Stallone has recently released ""Rocky VI"" and ""Rambo IV"". And now it's the turn of another sixty-something, Harrison Ford, to revisit his past triumphs with a belated fourth episode in the ""Indiana Jones"" series.The first three films were all set in the 1930s and the villains, at least in episodes 1 and 3, were the Nazis. (The villains in episode 2, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", were an Indian religious cult based upon the Thugs, who had actually been suppressed a century earlier). Episode 4 keeps to the basic formula, but to explain why Indy looks older than he did last time around it is a Cold War period piece set in 1957 with the Russians as the bad guys. Steven Spielberg, apparently, originally intended to make the villains a Neo-Nazi movement like the one in ""The Boys from Brazil""; he later changed his mind, but his original idea might explain why the film is set in South America, a continent often associated in popular culture with jungle-dwelling Nazi fugitives.The original ""Indiana Jones"" films created a formula which was copied in other franchises such as the ""Mummy"" and ""Tomb Raider"" films; an intrepid adventurer in some exotic part of the world is seeking some relic or artefact with mystical powers. The aforesaid relic is normally also being sought by a gang of villains, whom the aforesaid intrepid adventurer must outwit. In this case the relic in question is a mysterious crystal skull created by an alien race of beings once worshipped as gods by a lost civilisation. Indy must return the skull to its rightful place in a temple in the Amazon rainforest and prevent it from being misappropriated by the Soviets, who believe that its mystical properties will enable them to achieve world domination. Indy is also reunited with his former lover Marion Ravenwood and a young man named Mutt Williams who turns out to be his long-lost son Henry Jones III. (The film is perhaps intended to prepare the way for an episode 5, with Shia LaBeouf inheriting the lead role from his screen father).My greatest surprise in this film was Harrison Ford; I had assumed that, at 65, he would be too old to play an action hero again, but although he is obviously older than he was when he last played the role in 1989 he still looks very convincing in it, both as Dr Henry Jones jr., the tweedy, mild-mannered Ivy League professor of archaeology, and as Indiana Jones, the gallant adventurer. Cate Blanchett is also good as the principal baddie, KGB officer Dr Irina Spalko. She plays Irina as a sexy, jackbooted villainess with a hint of the dominatrix about her. There are a couple of good cameos from John Hurt as the mad old professor Harold Oxley and from Ray Winstone as a treacherous British double agent, probably based on Burgess, Maclean & Co.The action sequences, fight scenes, car chases, etc. are well done, but the film has its fair share of implausibilities (in one scene Indy manages to survive a nuclear blast by, believe it or not, hiding in a refrigerator) and goofs, often related to history or geography. The scriptwriter clearly seemed unaware of the differences between various Pre-Columbian cultures; for example the Maya, whose civilisation was based in Central America and southern Mexico, never (as is implied here) reached the Amazon. Indy states that he learnt to speak Quechua while fighting as a young man with the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa against the dictator General Huerta; Quechua, however, was the language of the Incas and is spoken in Peru and other Andean countries, not in Mexico. (I suspect that this detail was inserted by the liberal Spielberg to show that, although the villains are now Communists rather than Nazis, Indy remains an old lefty at heart).Spielberg has always struck me as something of an overrated director, and I have never really understood the awe in which he is held in some quarters. His reputation hangs very heavily upon his one undoubted masterpiece, ""Schindler's List"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Amistad"". Most of his other attempts at serious film making, (""The Color Purple"", ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Saving Private Ryan""), although undoubtedly worthy, are often rather dull and long-winded, and his lighter films (the excellent comedy ""Catch Me If You Can"" being an exception) are really just popcorn action movies writ large. ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" falls into the latter category, but it is a well-made and enjoyable example of the genre. 6/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
48,Smells_Like_Cheese,A tribute to the fans,7,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the 19 year long awaited sequel, the big summer blockbuster is finally here! I was lucky enough to see the premiere tonite, my hopes were up, the audience was pumped, everyone was just excited, why wouldn't you be? This was the Indiana Jones to blow the trilogy out of the water. Unfortunately, I'm feeling a little empty, I am such a huge fan of the trilogy, movies that hold memories for me as well as excitement still to this day when I watch the Indiana Jones movies. Indiana is back, this film had a little bit of the old style that I was looking forward too, however, I feel like we were lied too. The makers of the film told us there would be no CGI unless it was needed like the old films, not only was there a lot of CGI, the older films had special effects, but they were real, this was a little too cartoonish at times. Not only that, but I felt like the 50's stereotype was being too rubbed in our faces: the jocks vs. greasers, the cold war fear, nuclear bomb testings, the Russians, and the aliens. I'm not going to lie, while the movie is flawed; this is still a fun action packed adventure film that is worth the full price ticket. I think the story was just more of a tribute rather than an actual movie on it's own.Indiana Jones is back, when the Russians have kidnapped him, Irina Spalko wants him to take her to find a crystal skull that is supposedly the skull of an alien. When they find it, the skull is to be returned to it's kingdom and supposedly they will hold all the power to the kingdom. Indiana manages to escape, meeting a young boy, Mutt, who tells him about Professor Oxley, who Indiana went to school with and how Mutt has heard about the skull and wants Indiana to find it with him. Together they set out to find it with the Russians on their tail, to meet with a familiar face, Marion(Raiders of the Lost Ark, you remember?), to find out another little secret about Mutt and Indiana.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I do have positives about the film. We have our fun adventure film, rooting for the good guys, laughs, and excitement. Harrison Ford still has Indiana in his blood, no one could ever take his place, Shia made himself a worthy co-star and their chemistry worked very well. Marion was a nice touch, bringing back something to the fans of the trilogy. The only problem I have with this being more of a tribute is that if you watch the trilogy, while they are connected movies, if you were to watch The Temple of Doom first before Raiders, you'd get the movie without having to see the first one. Since this is a very long awaited sequel, I can see why they would want to please the fans, but there is a new generation who unfortunately might have not seen Raiders or The Last Crusade to understand this sequel on certain characters and lines. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is definitely worth your time, but as a fan, I can't help but feel that the ending made me question what the sequel's true motives were: money or for the fans? Judge for yourself.7/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
49,blanbrn,"Good, yet nothing great even though it's plenty of nostalgia and popcorn fueled it doesn't live up to the hype.",7,25 May 2008,"The latest installment in the Spielberg and Lucas saga ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" once again delivers the action, and fast paced drama of their other films even though if the story falls somewhat short as a plot blended with mystery and aliens just isn't as interesting. Still the movies legacy and Spielberg's direction and Indy's cracking of the whip make again for the type of film to be a popcorn hit and sell plenty of tickets.At 65 yet potent Harrison Ford is back as part time archaeologist and part time adventurer and still he looks as graceful and is in top form as ever in his portrayal as the seasoned Jones. Now Indy is in pursuit of a magic cranium to see where this crystal skull belongs in mythology and to see if it has extinct civilization. Also this saga is set in the Cold War era of the 1950's and Indy faces the ruthlessness of power hungry Soviet slinky vamp Irina(Cate Blanchett who vamps the role up). Both desire the skull because of it's mind controlling power.Then enter Mutt(Shia LaBeouf)and this is where a new family entry occurs with Indy. As after many years once they meet Indy will discover that Mutt is his long lost son. As Mutt who's a rebel and wild one type who brings images of a young Brando to mind wants to find his long lost mother with the help of Indy and you guessed it once an old flame of Indy's is discovered that being Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen)then this rounds out as Mutt finds out who his mommy and daddy is for the first time! Thru and during this adventure ride it has it's nice moments wild jungle ride chases and double agents, monkeys, tribal warriors, and ants, and of course snakes. Yet the screenplay and plot is murky as to who is chasing who for why and what reasons and the skull may be transparent.No big surprise in the end though as Indy representing the west is going to win over the cold Eastern totalitarian like Irina. So all in all the film is okay another good adventure and thrill ride that's so popcorn style and true it pays good homage to the times of the 1950's lifestyle, still this is nothing new. In my opinion this franchise from Spielberg may go ahead and stamp itself out as the test of time may have passed so enjoy this as maybe for all of us it will be good if Indy has cracked his whip for the last time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
50,MovieAddict2016,Shockingly inept - did I really just watch this?,3,22 May 2008,"Let me start by saying Indiana Jones is a staple of my childhood, like many of you who might be reading this review, but I've never been a so-called ""fanboy."" I enjoy all three movies, specifically the first and third, and I can appreciate ""Temple of Doom"" in spite of its faults.So I went to see the midnite screening with an open mind - no real expectations one way or another - and to be fair the first fifteen minutes, while not exactly very in-tune with the style of the previous films, entertained me. Then, suddenly Indiana Jones turned into a superhuman and - in a shockingly absurd scene, even by adventure film standards - survives the most improbable predicament I've ever seen in a film. And I saw ""Live Free or Die Hard."" And I bring that film up for a reason - because despite fans of Die Hard claiming DH4 was watered down and over-the-top (which it was), it was still _fun_. And I felt like I was watching John McClane - for all the lack of swearing, the essence of the character was still intact. And even though he became Superman a few times towards the end of the movie, the action sequences were staged well and exciting to watch.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" suffers because the action scenes aren't well staged or exciting. They're not merely over-the-top - they're just dull and stupid. And they're filmed so ineptly that I was completely shocked that Spielberg had anything to do with this. This is a complete backtrack from his recent directorial advances - forget whatever he may have learned from all his critically acclaimed films over the past decade; ""Crystal Skull"" is his worst film since ""Hook."" And, you know, I kinda like Hook in a guilty-pleasure sort of way, which I can't even say about this film - because there's nothing guiltily fun about it. It's big, bloated and - worst of all - boring.Unlike Stallone with Rambo 4 or Willis with DH4, I honestly didn't *feel* like I was watching Indiana Jones. There was maybe one moment in the entire film where I thought to myself, ""He's back! It's Indy!"" The rest of the film he didn't look, feel or seem like Indy - maybe it has to do with Ford's age. I don't know. But to me - and I'm not just saying this to be mean and I'm not using overstatement - it seemed like he wasn't ""into it."" Which I know isn't true because I honestly think his intentions were honest and he was doing this for the fans more than for the money. But not for one real moment did I feel like I was watching Indiana Jones let alone an Indiana Jones movie.I sadly don't have enough space to write all my concerns with this film, because there are many. And to categorize them briefly may come across as ignorant, but for space constraints, I have to. Firstly: the CGI. I don't have a problem with it being used as much as some people seem to - but it's awful. It stands out because it's so poor. All the backgrounds are bad enough, but to see Shia swinging through vines in a jungle with a pack of monkeys - everyone in the theater erupted in laughter, which I don't believe was the filmmakers' intent.Aside from my faults with Indy's presentation in the film, the supporting cast is totally underplayed. Jim Broadbent? Introduced and then gone - painfully neglected. John Hurt? He does the rambling incoherent old man routine quite well but you never feel like he's very genuine. The biggest pains to me were Shia and Karen Allen returning as Marion. I know it was a shock for her to return to the role, but did she have to stand there throughout the last 45 minutes of the movie with a constant big cheesy grin on her face? Her son is standing between two speeding cars having a sword fight with a Soviet soldier through a dense jungle, dodging bullets from nearby Soviets who are trying to kill them all - and all she can do is manage a grin and crack a joke about her son's stance? (He took fencing lessons.) Everything that made the character so special in Raiders is GONE. The feisty dialogue between her and Indy is emulated - but comes across as painfully cheesy and people in the theater were again laughing at unintentional parts. (Marion: ""I'm sure you had plenty of girls over the years!"" Indy: ""Yeah, but there was just one problem. None of 'em were you, babe!"") I won't go into the misdirection of the action sequences, the contrivances of the plot (or the fact that it seemed to be made up as it went along and totally lacked the cohesion and suspense of the first three films) or the supreme overacting of Cate Blanchett or the silly typical ""Is he a bad guy or isn't he?"" character of Mac (Ray Winstone in yet another underdeveloped role for a character that deserved greater).Sadly I've run out of room here. Most of my further comments would ruin the film anyway. But suffice to say - this is far worse than I ever imagined it should or even could be - I just can't believe such a talented team made this, and it really disappoints me on so many levels not just that the film is merely ""bad"" but that it is SO bad; and that not for one second did I feel like I was watching the iconic action hero again. It was Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones, but it wasn't Indiana Jones. And at the bare minimum, in spite of the film's flaws, I was hoping I'd at least get that much.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

52,KineticSeoul,"The attraction to Indy is gone, but it's still a fun adventure movie",6,8 January 2017,"What made the predecessors in this franchise stand out was because it had a protagonist that attracted the audiences. The sense of realism, mixed in with the supernatural and the sense of adventure. ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" hits the mark only on the last part. Indy now isn't someone that will attract kids to want to be, because he is in his settling down stage. They mention it in the movie itself where one guy mentions to Indy that ""it seems to have reached the age where life stops giving us things and starts taking them away"". So it's difficult for people to connect with a hero during that stage, especially for a character like Indiana. Throw in Shia LaBeouf into the mix, with the director trying very hard to make him seem cool makes the movie take a bit of a nosedive. Cate Blanchett was terrific as a Ukrainian Villainess. Yeah, the action scenes seemed a bit too wacky, inauthentic and the overuse of CGI didn't help. With the adventure taking turn for a set of odd turn of events. Which includes some subplots that drag down the movie and tries to make it too kid friendly. But I thought it was still a fun adventure to sit through, but for a Indy movie it was actually quite disappointing. 6.8/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It was very nice to see Ford as Indiana Jones back on the screen, as well as Nancy Allen as Marion Ravenwood. There are some pretty fun action scenes and great visual effects you've come to expect and love from the Indiana Jones movies; Ford proves that he can still engage in some kick-butt action even if it has been nearly two decades since he took on the Indy role. However, the movie overall was pretty boring as it lacks an intriguing story and the plot elements didn't match the height of the thrills from the three previous films in the series. Much of the overall acting elements wasn't very entertaining, as Cate Blanchett made an annoying villain and Shia LaBeouf gave an overzealous, portrayal of Mutt Williams. The relationship between Indiana and Marion was not emphasized. Overall, this movie lacks urgency and pulsating thrills - no tension built-up and no character chemistry, which makes this the weakest in the Indiana Jones series.

54,Buddy-51,Keeping Up With the Joneses,7,30 June 2008,"Looking remarkably hale and fit for a man in his 60's, Harrison Ford returns as everyone's favorite archaeologist/adventurer in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" the fourth installment in the series that started with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" way back in 1981 (before Dr. Jones had sufficient notoriety to get his name placed in the title).It's 1957 and Indy's off on his latest adventure, hacking his way through the jungles of Peru in search of a mysterious crystal skull that may be a relic from a race of extraterrestrials who visited the area several millenia ago. He is joined in his quest by Shia Labeouf as a cocky, motorcycle-riding teenager who may have more in common with the old codger than either of them can imagine; Karen Allen in a fun return as Jones' old flame from ""Raiders"" who's been kidnapped by some Russian agents; John Hurt as a fellow archaeologist who may already have fallen under the spell of the mysterious ancient artifact; and Cate Blanchett as an evil Soviet scientist intent on getting her hands on the object as a means of giving her country a strategic advantage in the escalating Cold War.""Crystal Skull"" is not a great action flick by any means but, like its predecessors, it has a comfy old-fashioned quality that has us rooting for the good guys and against the bad guys in the best Saturday-afternoon-matinée tradition. Director Steven Spielberg manages to get the adrenalin pumping with his exciting, if frankly preposterous, action sequences (ably enhanced by John Williams' made-to-order score) and the funny bone twitching with a series of smart-alecky one-liners, many of them aimed at Indiana's obviously advanced age, which the writer, David Koepp, in his wisdom, has chosen not to ignore but rather to make the object of some entirely good-natured joshing.These factors alone compensate for the over length, the occasional bog down in the action, and a finale that feels more appropriate to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" than to the Indiana Jones franchise.More than anything else, perhaps, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" proves that you don't have to be in your 20's or 30's to be a robust, whip-cracking, action movie hero.

Some of it is a bit over the top (the Tarzan-ish scene swings to mind) but for the most part it works. The performances are good and it's nice to see the return of Karen Allen.Unfortunately, the laughable nature of the story takes away from the movie. The sci-fi elements seem out of place in this series, and while I wouldn't go so far as to say there were major plot holes or things overall didn't make sense, there was a disjointed quality about the narrative. And there were some ludicrous events (""go get help"" was a line that in context made no sense at all).Also, should Indy have really been so helpful to the Russians? Is that really what he would do?

56,Robert_duder,Far from perfect and yet somehow for the true fan...pure perfection in every way,10,28 May 2008,"What can I begin to say about Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal skull? I don't like the title, I can tell you that even though it makes sense having seen it. I could most definitely nit pick my way through the entire film and tell you everything I didn't like about it because I am an enormous Harrison Ford fan and therefore a huge Indy fan and have been since I was a kid like many of us. But I went into it with clear and concise expectations. My favorite movie hero was returning after nineteen years, probably for the last time, with two members of the original Raiders cast, the original director, the whole family back again and they knew this character inside out and backwards and they would not lose sight of their fans and they did exactly that. Was it perfectly made? No. Did it have resounding things I could live without? Yes. Is it the best film of 2008 so far...yah pretty sure it is. How do you go from a 1950's nuclear testing ground, to the very same warehouse where the Ark was stored at the end of Raiders, to tombs, burial chambers, Alien gods, thick jungles, creepy graveyards, campy dialog, kick butt action, snakes, deadly flesh eating ants, witty one liners, and teaching a class? Simple. Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Now tell me you're not intrigued? Harrison Ford who is an absolute master of his craft returns to his infamous role as Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. at 65 years old. Does it show? Sure sometimes, but he knows it and they don't try to hide it like some films might do (ie: Rambo) In fact they use it as stepping stone for some very funny moments. The fact is Ford still looks terrific and easily carries the action regardless of age which is exactly what we would expect from Indiana Jones. He makes the film period...still. Shia LaBeouf, Hollywood's current Golden kid, is Indy's young sidekick Mutt Williams. He plays the overly predictable 50's poster boy with homages to Elvis and Marlon Brando which is done very specifically on purpose I think. LaBeouf is decent enough and they don't over use him which is good and he holds his own opposite Ford. The fact is they had to have him or someone under the age of 50 in the cast. The cast looks and feels old and they needed young blood to attract newcomers to the series and youngsters and LaBeouf is the perfect guy to do it. Although he could never, and shouldn't take over the series. Karen Allen returns as the love of Indy's life, the sharp talking Marion Ravenwood. Her character has a lot less sass than in Raiders nearly 30 years ago which is probably a good progression for her character. Her and Ford still have good chemistry and she is a good choice for the love interest without it being a heavy part of the story. Cate Blanchett is the villainess of the story. I have an issue with her to begin with, I think she is ferociously over rated as an actress and this role didn't help. Her accent is ridiculous and her over thought out Russian dominatrix look but they don't really push the character on you too much so it's not so bad but I could have done without her anyways. Ray Winstone and John Hurt round out the supporting main cast decently although not really important to the story all that much.If anyone else had done this film besides Steven Spielberg I am convinced that it would have been a disaster. For one thing he is the mastermind behind these characters along with George Lucas and he is a brilliant director who can truly make you believe anything. There were SO many scenes that just caught me and I thought...wow that is a brilliantly made scene that I could see 10 20 years from now and think..I remember seeing Kingdom of The Crystal Skull. Picture perfect shots basically. While it's true that the story is even more far fetched than ever before and I truly could have done without the Alien connection but really it's the only thing Indy has never delved into it so why the hell not? It's not like thousand year old nights, the wrath of God himself, or meeting face to face with Hitler is any more believable and the rest of the film around it made you believe it so bravo to Spielberg for doing what I believe NO ONE else could have. The special effects were good, and I think for the most part they tried to keep to the true Indy nature of miniatures and stunt doubles and then when they did use the CGI, it was awful. The scene with Shia LaBeouf's character swinging through the jungle with the monkeys was one of the worst scenes in movie history I have ever seen especially considering this was such an incredible movie. It was so unnecessary it felt like they had to do it as a horrible prank on all of us. Still Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull is every fan boys dream with oodles of easter eggs for fun (mentioning an episode of Young Indiana Jones, Sean Connery and Denholm Elliott who played Marcus Brody in all three previous films.) I must see this again and I love it and I am more than happy to bring it into the Indiana Jones series...I think it might possibly be my second favorite one in fact. Indy still has it!! Please see this future classic in the theaters NOW!! 10/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
57,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A bit creaky looking but delivers what it says on the tin,9,7 July 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nearly twenty years since we last saw Indy in action, we return to find him being chased, with his new pal Mac (Ray Winstone) by Nazis who are after an ancient artifact. Outnumbered and back-stabbed, Indy, being Indy, manages to escape and after a spot of bother with a nuclear testing ground (this being 1957 and all, Cold War, y'know) returns to his job lecturing at college. Unfortunately, his friend the dean (Jim Broadbent) informs him he must be let go after annoying the authorities. However, he finds new meaning to his life when he's approached by rebellious young greaser Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) who wants help finding his mother. However, also missing is Indy's old pal Ox (John Hurt) who has gone hunting for the mysterious 'kingdom of the Crystal Skull' in the legendary city of Acuador, which gives the mission it's own personal stakes.Not being the biggest fan of Indy and coming, as I said, nearly twenty years after the last film, I didn't rush out to see this new film (wouldn't have wanted to wade through the crowds, either.) But for afficianados of the series, everything is up to scratch here. The old gang, including director Steven Spielberg and love interest Karen Allen, are back and in the modern age of wire-fu and frenetically cut action, have given a defiantly old fashioned family adventure with some scenes that may be too scary for kids under twelve.In the lead role ('cos lets face it, who else could do it?) Ford looks his age but more power to him for not going down the Sly Stallone route and having obvious botox/nip-tuck. He even has the good grace to poke fun at the number on his birthday cake early on in the film, missing his landing when swinging onto the back of a truck and exclaiming ""my eyesight's not so good!"" Winstone takes a very basic role and manages to be surprisingly effective with it. As Jones's (loyal) sidekick, LaBeouf tries a bit too hard and fails to be truly convincing in his role. Hurt and Broadbent have good roles but get too little screen-time to really make anything of them.Even if you're not the biggest fan of Indy, this is still a film best seen on the big screen, for the sound effects and of course the special effects. While the pace sags in parts, things do really heat up towards the end, which lets rip with some cracking thrills and spills, which the CGI team help along no end. The only downside is the actual crystal skull, which looks a bit plastic. While it may look a bit out of place amongst a lot of the other stuff out now, Indiana Jones 4 is still an undeniable reminder of what makes going to the cinema so magic. ****",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
58,ElMaruecan82,"Not worse than ""Temple of Doom""... and I liked ""Temple of Doom""...",7,11 August 2017,"Why all the hatred? Why so serious? Granted I'm not the most hardcore fan of the series but I don't think there's ever been an Indiana Jones' movie I didn't enjoy, and over-the-top isn't certainly a term I would use negatively to describe my experience with ""Kingdom of the Crystal of Skull"", that alliteration alone is worthy of praises, as the wonderful outcome of a long brainstorming between Spielberg and his buddy Lucas if anything, this film is the work of two friends, not that it makes it better, but there's something that exudes friendship all through the film, even the nods to the previous films play like sympathetic winks to (I guess, unreceptive) fans.Now, of course the film has the kind of ludicrous premises that pay like the perfect tribute to old 50's B-movies but maybe not to the iconic flavor of the first film. Of course, the best parts of the film are those that pay tribute to ""Raiders"" and ""Crusade"", but does that make them any less enjoyable? We didn't see Ford embodying his most legendary character for two decades, watching him pick his feet with his iconic outfit would have been good enough. Seriously, every 'replay' is simply enjoyable on the basis of the 'rediscovery' effect, so why trying to wish for a more realistic plot, since when ""Indiana Jones"" is supposed to have substance? But that comes from someone who loved ""Temple of Doom"", so maybe I'm not the most objective as far as judgment goes.Well, forgive my sins, but I just love over-the-top and exaggerated (even to the point of silliness) Indiana Jones, the nuked fridge part, yeah that infamous moment was so crazy I actually admired the guts of Lucas and Spielberg, I guess it takes some moxy to risk such a crazy stunt at a time where Internet became like a real whip for the fans, where any little bit of silliness can go viral. So everyone buzzed on the infamous fridge moment, ""South Park"" illustrated the film with the delicate metaphor of the two bearded directors enjoying sexual intercourse, but of all the programs, ""South Park"" should have embraced it more jovially, the icons were iconoclasts, they didn't ruin the series, they might have destroyed the pedestal built by the fans on the basis that Indiana Jones isn't a series to be taken seriously, for all the Aztec Gods' sake! Seriously, it's not like they threw aliens in a 'James Bond' film, Indiana Jones has always been venturing in supernatural territories, and while Lucas was a sucker for sci-fi B movies and Spielberg didn't want to introduce a sequel to ""ET"" in his beloved franchises, the two found a fair balance inspired by the theories about pre-alien civilizations. Do I buy it? Well, in a universe where evil Nazis can melt and where the power of God is materialized, why shouldn't I admit that the Big Boss has his ways, and that maybe Aliens knew him before mankind or that they had achieved the ultimate knowledge, why shouldn't we accept that technology existed before. This is from the guy who made us believe that light-sabers existed a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away why shouldn't ""Indiana Jones"" takes place in the same universe? And I accept it even more since it doesn't take most of the film, the rest is the classic adventure in the traditional format, with its share of goofy chase scenes and a buddy-duo with Mutt, a little runt disguised as Brando's Wild One, played by Shia Leboeuf and who's revealed to be Indy's son with Marion, in the most awkward moment. The interactions between the old man and his rebellious son, work for the most part, because you can tell there's some good chemistry between the actors who have obviously fun playing their parts, same for Karen Allen who makes a nice come-back as Mation. The rest of the cast involve scary Russians, with a scene-stealing performance by Cate Blanchett, to see an Oscar-nominated actress loosening up a little and going for a James Bond villain impersonation with the haircut of Mia Wallace is refreshing to say the least.And while everyone is busy spewing venom against the fridge scene, I will praise the best scene of all, the one with the red ants, a scene full of contrivances and over-the-top demises that I can't think of any reason to hate it, I kept one waiting for some gruesome death and I got it, my only regret is that after showing the body thrown into the ant hill, we didn't even have a glimpse on the aftermath, that was a missed opportunity for Spielberg, sure the close-up on the skulls are scary but the unknown never scares as much as the gruesome. Overall, this is a thrilling experience enhanced by the performance of John Hurt.Now, let me temper my enthusiasm, I'm not saying the film is perfect even on Indiana Jones' standards, surely there are a few little flaws, the CGI effects don't look always convincing and the film won't reach the same status as the previous ones, maybe in a few decades. Yet, it's still fun to see good old Ford on the road again, a bit rusty on the whip but still brave, adventurous and scared of snakes, but never leaving his hat. The film is about getting old and keeping the spirit, Spielberg and Lucas didn't lose theirs, at least, that's how I felt.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

60,bowmanblue,"C'mon, it's not THAT bad!",7,30 August 2014,"I'm writing this after my second viewing of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. During my first watch, I thought it was simply 'okay.' I did tend to dwell on its low points, as it does definitely have a different flavour to the previous trilogy. However, after a second watch, I've decided that I actually quite like it. Yes, it still has its flaws and, yes, it's probably the least coherent of the quadrology, but it's still head and shoulders over most other action/adventure movies.Ignoring the fridge scene, it has numerous good points - beginning with Harrison Ford as Indy - he's still got it. It's worth watching for him alone. However, the supporting cast don't fair so well. Shia LaBeouf doesn't really become likable until near the end, Karen Allen doesn't have the same gritty toughness she did in Raiders of the Lost Ark, John Hurt barely says a word, Jim Broadbent is hardly in it and Ray Winstone plays the stereotypical British coward/bad guy we see in so many Hollywood movies.But, at least we still have Indy. And he's battling the Russians this time. Some people didn't like that (thinking it should still be the Nazis), but I saw it as natural progression. However, apart from that awful fridge scene, the main thing people objected to was the inclusion of aliens/UFOs into 'Indy lore.' It never occurred to me that this was bad until I saw the reaction from the fans. If you really hate the prospect, I guess you're best to ignore the forth instalment of the franchise.For me, the downside of Crystal Skull was the over-reliance on CGI effects and the fact that many scenes weren't really explained (plus the supporting cast not given enough to work with).However, I'm glad Part 4 was made. I know it's now killed the franchise as it is, but at least that means we'll never have to watch Shia LaBeouf as a sort of 'Indy substitute.'

I waited long years since they mentioned this film and now I finally got to see it. This film was not disappointing at all, even after a 19-year disappearance. Harrison Ford reprises his role as the adventurous Indiana Jones. He and his ""comrade"" gets kidnapped by the communist Russians. Jones eventually escapes and meets with Mutt Williams. They head down to South American to find a skull that can give them power. Jones and Williams are kidnapped by the Russians along with Jones's former girlfriend, Marion Ravenwood. Now they have to keep the skull away from Spalko and her communists while returning the skull to the rightful owners. The acting is excellent in this movie. This movie is also filled with humor that was in the movies 20 years ago. Even though Harrison Ford is in his late 60's, he can still kick his enemie's butt. Shia LaBeouf did wonderful as Mutt William. I think that Cate Blanchett who played Spalko is a bit scary. The music by John Williams is a masterpiece. This film was filmed liked the ones in the 80's times a few more special effects. Also, the plot line is very interesting and is full of surprises. This is probably the best Indiana Jones film.

64,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Tame, twee, tepid, tiresome and tedious",3,3 August 2008,"What an immense disappointment this film was. After 19 years of waiting we deserved something better. I can't imagine what Spielberg was thinking when he threw this film together. It's a long, long way from the previous instalments in the franchise.Harrison Ford looks bored out of his mind and who wouldn't be. It's not that he's too old or anything it's just that there is nothing much for him to do apart from spew loads of exposition (the previous films kept this to a minimum). Up until this instalment every Indy film had several key, iconic scenes. Be it a tumbling rock or a mine car chase there was something standout and memorable about all of them. There's nothing like that here, nothing.The pre-release hype reminded me a lot Bruce Willis talking-up Die Hard 4 the previous summer. He assured that the film would be 'old school' and was 'the best one yet'. And then when it did finally come out it was a PG-13 family movie filled with CGI effects. So much for old school. Spielberg tried to hype Indy IV with the same logic. He'd be shooting in Panavision (sadly not as common as it used to be), editing the old-fashioned way and using as many non-computer-generated effects as possible.Well, that turned out to be a lie. Crystal Skull looks far too slick to be in the same category as Douglas Slocombe's fantastically dark photography of the first three. Not only is CGI prevalent throughout there is also extensive use of digital mattes which look totally out of place in an Indy film. In no way does this look or feel like either of the three movies that preceded it.I have read that Frank Darabont wrote the original script which both Spielberg and Ford loved but George Lucas (who has been flogging his one long-dead horse since 1977 for all it's worth) hated it. I have no idea what that script was about but I have no doubt that it was miles better than what we finally got. Aliens simply do NOT belong in an Indy film. Lucas can force that nonsense on us in his endless Star Wars series as much as he wants but not here, Sir. And on top of that the plot doesn't even make sense and is very poorly delivered to the viewer, excessive exposition or not. Indy IV feels more like a rejected Mummy 3 script than anything else.Karen Allen returns as Marion but has next to nothing to do apart from drive a car-boat and tag along with the already bloated cast. Indy, Mutt, Mac, Ox and Marion all searching for an ancient treasure while being pursued by (a gorgeous) Cate Blanchett. My God is this ain't the friggin' Goonies, man. And despite the PG-13 rating it is probably the tamest Indy film yet. Look at the final scene in Raiders with the exploding heads and melting faces. How brilliant and timeless is that? It's pure imagination mixed with great make-up effects and it's a finale that everyone remembers. Irina Spalko (who does not one evil thing in the whole movie) meets an altogether much lazier fate. I won't ruin it for you despite already having given most of the ending away but I will say that it's quick and unaffecting and looks like it came out of a video game.When all else fails you could usually turn to John Williams for comfort. Sorry folks, but Williams (along with everyone else, it seems) is strictly phoning it in for this one. His themes are lazy, boring and instantly forgettable. Don't expect anything as awesome as 'Parade of the Slave Children' or 'Desert Chase' here. The Ark of the Covenant theme can be heard near the start but all the new material is as bland as it can get.Indy IV should never have happened. If the series MUST have been continued then a big-screen Young Indiana Jones adventure would have held so much more potential. The Young Indy series is exactly what you need to watch if you feel let down by this time-wasting potboiler.Spielberg has lost it.

It is the late fifties and the abductors are Russians, America's cold war enemies. Heading the party is psychic-powered Irina (Cate Blanchett), one of Stalin's favorites, and she commands Indy to find a large crate in the warehouse on the property. Knowing that Professor Jones was part of the group that locked away the crate, she is certain he can do as she wishes. Reluctantly, Indy agrees. But, once the box is found and Irina is pleased with its contents, Indy makes his escape. After various pitfalls in Nevada, Indy lands back at his university position. But, in short order, Mutt (Shia LeBoef) arrives, a young wild rider in the Brando tradition. He tells Indy that an old friend, Oxley (John Hurt) and his mother need his services in Peru and quickly. Since Indy has already been given a leave of absence, he and the young Mutt embark on the journey. Once there, they become entangled in a plot to return a crystal skull, an old pre-Colombian treasure, to the heart of the Amazon jungle. But, Irina and her group is there, also, because she believes the skull has tremendous psychic energy and she wants to be present when it is returned to its original location. She guesses, correctly, that its power will grow when it is connected to its crystal body and that she will be able to use that power for herself and for the Soviet Empire. But, will they all be able to find the city of origin, as it is a mythical town, even though Oxley has looked into the skull's eyes and received a map? It is so difficult to give a description of this film without spoilers, so I marked the box above. However, I do hope I have left enough gaps for any reader to enjoy the movie, as it is fun, fun, fun. The cast is very nice, with Ford doing a fine reprisal of his most famous role. Karen Allen, from the first film, shows up, too, and what a pleasure to see her again and to enjoy her performance. Hurt, Jim Broadbent, Le Boef, and the others contribute to the film nicely, too. As for Blanchett, she is absolutely wonderful in a role that is both comic and deadly determined. If you are a fan of hers, don't miss this one. The scenery, special effects, costumes, and cinematography are very good, naturally, while the writing and direction are imaginative and zestful, even though some familiar and sometimes implausible elements appear. Best of all, like the other Jones flicks and the National Treasure series, this movie is guaranteed to make the young and the old scurry over to the library to discover the ancient history of South America, crystal skulls, and many other topics, too. So, therefore, do keep up with the Jones saga and make time for this wonderful film. You will be entertained to the hilt.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
67,Bored_Dragon,"""We seem to have reached the age where life stops giving us things and starts taking them away.""",7,15 June 2021,"But this did not stop veterans Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford to make another film about Indiana Jones after twenty years. The film was quite spat on and ridiculed at the time. I especially remember the episode of the animated series ""South Park"" dedicated to this ""rape"" of the cult adventurer. But now that I've finally watched it, I really don't see why so much negativity.The fact is that Ford is fairly old, but his performance is not far behind the one that made him famous in the eighties. Instead of Sean Connery as Indiana's father, he is now accompanied by his son, played by Shia LeBeouf. And there is Cate Blanchett in the role of a Russian agent, who leads a team of villains.The plot is set in the 1950s during the Cold War, and the Nazis are replaced by communists. This time, they are looking for crystal skulls that would enable the East to have parapsychological supremacy over the West. Again we have an adventure that takes us through the jungle, caves, and hidden cities, and the film is, although with modern production, in the same manner as the original trilogy when it comes to story and a general atmosphere.If I didn't know that it was made two decades after the original three, I might not have noticed. Only the Sci-Fi ending differs significantly from its predecessors. It's not a masterpiece, but neither are the previous three, and if you ignore the negative hype that followed it, I think that if you enjoyed the movies from the eighties, you will enjoy this one as well.7/10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This fourth long awaited installment is more like a Disneyland visual thrillride without the physical experience of being there.

A lot of the action is warmed over stuff that we've already seen before except with a thin varnish of making something look new and exciting. This predictable, not as intelligent, separate thrill ride scenes have been patched together to make an action movie.

69,slightlymad22,Weakest Of All The Indy Movies,6,26 November 2014,"It's not hard to see what retracted the principal cast to this project. Harrison Ford had not made a movie in two years, and he had not had a hit movie in eight years (""What Lies Beneath"" in 2000) and George Lucas's reputation (and no doubt ego) was still dented from the Star Wars prequels. As for director Steven Spielberg, ""War Of The Worlds"" aside he wasn't hitting his previous heights, (and you can argue the merits of that movie) you need to go back to 2002's ""Catch Me If You Can"" for his last critical and commercial success. His last movie 2005's ""Munich"" earned five Academy Awards nominations but is one of Spielberg's lowest- grossing films, whilst ""The Terminal"" received mixed reactions from critics. So take Hollywoods hottest boy wonder Shia LeBouf (though I fail to see why) and Oscar winning actress Cate Balnchet throw them in to an established franchise and you'd think you would have gold. However some of this movie is so ludicrous I wondered whether it was originally conceived as a spoof comedy. Outside of the first twenty minutes, Ford doesn't seem to be playing Indy here, just the gruff old man he plays in all his movies now. Balnchet is woefully miscast and LeBouf heavily inspired or just plain imitating Marlon Brando and Harrison Ford comes across as neither and nothing but a wannabe. Balnchet and LeBouf are awful but it's Ray Winston as Mac who is the worst actor here. His constant switching sides character (who Indy always believes for some reason) is annoying, but his performance is worse. In fact i'd go so far as to say it's the worst in the entire franchise.It's nice to see Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood as she was my favourite of Indy's women, the scenes between her and Ford is the highlight of the movie, and John Hurt is good too, but the constant nods to the earlier movies just serve as a reminder of the massive difference in quality between this and the original trilogy. This also has the worst ending in the franchise, and the worst score. Only Indy's theme and the Music lifted from ""Raiders"" are up to the expected standard. Then there is the CGI, the worst in the franchise for me, LeBouf swinging through the trees with CGI monkeys is a franchise low point.

Harrison Ford, at 65, still manages to convince as Indy, while Shia LeBoeuf, in Marlon leathers, is a rocker heading for rocks (sorry, the bad pun is a direct effect from listening to the Crystal Skull's script).Over-reliance on CGI, often a problem with films from the Lucas factory, allows some stunning set pieces, but we've seen it all before, and it does not compensate for essentially lazy movie-making.Fairly enjoyable but not a patch on its predecessors.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
72,Dr_Coulardeau,"Careful, Big Brother Spielberg is watching you",9,12 August 2008,"The film does not need a long commentary because the character is known by all and he is just the same as before, equal to himself. The film is funny because it reinvents the KGB, the Soviet Union, Stalin and the whole cold war just for fun. It is true that was easy in those days to have an enemy. After all he had the Nazis in one film, so why not the good old Soviet communists. But what is rather surprising is how Spielberg merges some influences in this new film. Amazing how his search is based on riddles, like Harry Potter's adventures. Amazing how E.T. finds his way into Peru and the old Incas, even if they seem to speak Maya. But that's just a Detail of course. But I find this not as creative as we could have expected. To attribute human culture, human civilization to the coming of an extra-terrestrial species of intelligent beings that looked like plain terrestrial human beings, to teach the very primitive human beings how to grow potatoes or corn is slightly trendy but banal. To bring together Siberia, the Pharaohs and the Incas, Mayas and why not Aztecs is rather easy and founded on so little. It is true there is also the theory that everything came from Antarctica with extra-terrestrials and all the paraphernalia of that sort, but that had been used by Aliens and Predators. He apparently preferred Stephen King's approach and his Tommy-knockers but without the cruelty, the vampirism of King, just the subservient gullibility of human beings who believe in a legend and that these strange beings were ready to share. Why not, since they officially did it before. That's one of the big contradictions of this film. These extra-terrestrials are not logical: they don't share their knowledge and they even try to destroy those who help them to move to that twilight zone lying (two meanings) between two universes. I must say Anne Rice's rewriting of these myths and legends is a lot more convincing and creative because she remains essentially human and her beyond belief idea is to bring in both witches and vampires. But these are human somewhere, are our everyday neighbors and friends, not the distant extra-terrestrials, and Anne Rice remains within the scope of human feelings, passions, derangements too but human all the same. The most attractive element is of course the third generation of Joneses. The dear Indiana Jones is finally provided with a son and that son is the one who takes him into the adventure. Hence he is the sequel of the old aging Indiana Jones who repeats he is old and aging so many times that I lost count about 20 minutes after the beginning. And it is true there are a couple of slower moments. But after all it is extremely moral and ethical since the younger Jones is provided with a married couple of parents at the end. Charming. Too charming for Indiana Jones. But we will have to do with that small detail.

73,zkonedog,Can't Hold A Candle To The Original Trilogy,3,11 March 2017,"In terms of film trilogies, the original three ""Indiana Jones"" sagas are about as good as they come in terms of action, adventure, drama, and even comedy. Unfortunately, this film goofs up the classic Indy formula and instead creates a lackluster, plodding effort that will only please those enthralled by much movement on the screen.For a basic plot summary, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" sees Indy (Harrison Ford) battling a group of 1950s Russians, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), for possession of an ancient ""crystal skull"" artifact that holds the key to the ancient Mayan civilization. Along the way, Dr. Jones runs into one old friend in Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), as well as a potential child prodigy Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf).The #1 problem with this film is readily apparent for fans of the Indy series up to this point: In the other films, Ford's Jones was always the ""straight man"" in a world that seemed to be crashing in on him either due to dramatic or comedic circumstances. He was a guy who could be counted on to get the job done and do the right thing, and viewers can identify with that. This time, though, Ford's Jones is nothing more than a goof (the tongue-in-cheek play on Ford's age only comes off as trite, not relevant), and thus difficult to root for. We WANT to see him be that swashbuckling hero again, but that's just not the way his character is developed this time around.It doesn't help that the supporting cast isn't really given enough to do. Allen (in what could have been a grand return) is little more than a bit part, while Mutt's entire character development is undermined when the film finally concludes (in a final scene that will have you rolling your eyes instead of clapping your hands).Director Steven Spielberg never wanted to resurrect the franchise to begin with, but enough pressure from Ford and George Lucas persuaded him to helm the project once again. From his own mouth, Spielberg said he never intended this film to be as grand as the original trilogy, but I think that is part of the problem. As a filmmaker, you can't just go from explosive to average...you either do a great job, or leave it creatively in the past.Thus, unless you are the largest of Indy fans and can overlook this film's many flaws in favor of the simple images of the whip and explorer's cap, you can skip this one. Just remember, instead, the classic trilogy for what it was.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
74,poe426,Shamefully stupid...,4,15 February 2009,"How well I recall the feeling when I first saw the opening sequence of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK: it was as if someone had tapped into some unconscious need and fulfilled it. As Indiana Jones made good his getaway, I was convinced that George Lucas (despite his having given us one of the dumbest franchises in the history of mass-marketing) and Steven Spielberg had joined forces to forge a lasting legacy. No sooner had I reached this conclusion than things began to fall apart up there on the big screen. It got worse as the movie wore on (and on and on); by the end, my opinion had taken a turn for the worse, as well. Though I saw the next installment, my expectations had been lowered. Greatly. I didn't even bother with Chapter Three for years. (When I finally did see it, it only confirmed what I'd already figured out: that it was all just another feckless money-making franchise lacking any real soul.) Which brings me to this latest loser. INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is about as shamelessly stupid as anything I've ever seen. That's saying a lot, considering that it was written and directed by two Hollywood heavyweights. Were this a no-budget B movie (or even one of the Poverty Row serials it emulates), one might be inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt- but it's not. I'm not going to bother to list the lapses of logic; they are far, far too many, and life's way too short; but things get off to a very shaky start and just snowball into what amounts to a freakin' avalanche. It's hard to believe that two of the biggest names in show business could crap out like this- but it's happened before and will no doubt happen again... because no one involved with this one had the common sense to catch the gaffs (or the guts to point them out to their masters).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
75,johnnyboyz,It's 'crystal' clear that whoever had a hand in this production might need their 'skull' examined.,5,25 February 2009,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crysal Skull begins with the immediate image of a little furry animal popping up from its home or state of hibernation in order to rear its head. Following this, it comes within about a whisker from being crushed by an oncoming, pounding force in the form of a car. Whilst the entire sequence is bizarre in its own sense, it uncannily sets up the scenario the Indiana Jones franchise (if you can still call it that) faces: a time away from the limelight, 'underground' if you like, before rearing its head and all the time under threat of being crushed under its own brand name and hype as soon as it decides to retire from its decade-and-three-quarter-long slumber.Of course there's no way that little animal would've stayed under ground for 19 years but you see the connection between coming out of hiding and immediately facing the risk of just being torn apart by young people out for guilty entertainment. Such is the fourth Indiana Jones film, or perhaps we should be referring to it as the fourth Henry Jones jnr. film, and its subsequent venture down all trails familiar and disappointing with both those adjectives remaining grounded within one's mind whilst watching it. But that's not to say the film is disappointing because it's familiar, rather disappointing because it's just so casual and lacklustre in any sort of scares or character. It doesn't even have an interesting enough story to keep us running along side it throughout. There are no moments; there are no 'wow' moments like there were in the past such as temples full of insects and collapsing ceilings complete with spikes or aeroplane dogfights and famous snake-pits and consequent escapes.It's unfortunate that Spielberg has to dumb his action down to H-bomb blasts, vine swinging and bizarre bar brawls between 'greasers' and high school jocks at the best of times. Additionally, the action scene he sold the film on takes place in the same warehouse we saw at the very end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, signifying that Spielberg really isn't taking it seriously and has to revisit past locales in daft and unnecessary references that is pleasant the first time but not afterwards.There is a scene in the film, quite early on, in which Indiana Jones himself; Harrison Ford as always and looking great, talks to biker kid Mutt Williams (LaBeouf) in a café about the film's plot thus laying everything out for us. This one scene sums up the aura this Indiana Jones film carries; a film that, like that individual scene, wants us to focus on these two leads going through this red herring of a narrative but there is just too much going on in the back ground for us to care. There is a sense of distraction, we are caught up with the event because Spielberg and his writers have piled all this on top of us and it's overwhelming  it's a sense that is established in that one scene and is definitely maintained by the time we reach the out of nowhere climax involving temples, dimensions and LucasFilm-only knows what else.But then I wonder if it was ever going to be anything else other than a good crack in the first place but I do feel it could well have been something a little more. But what with Spielberg having his characters at the end of the third Indiana Jones film quite literally riding off into the sunset as the curtain comes down on The 'Last' Crusade, the feeling is that reopening the can of worms that is the franchise was always going to be a little futile and an exercise in colloquialism than anything else. But it's hard to like a film that only really has one particularly 'enjoyable' action sequence, that being the two vehicles rampaging through the jungle and along a cliff-top. The film sees Jones, Williams and company on an expedition driven by both a MacGuffin that is a crystal skull which is shaped in peculiar fashion and energy based on the sheer fact we're watching Harrison Ford in the hat, whip in hand, bounding and leaping all over the screen. Chasing them is the Soviet army, a bunch of bulky goons led by Cate Blanchett's rather daft Irina Spalko.I didn't like Blanchett's character and whoever envisaged her image needs to ask themselves some questions. As an individual, she wears a boiler suit; has a misplaced haircut; uses a sword and often dons the same looking sunglasses Jean Reno wore in 1994 film Léon. The story doesn't matter much; the fact is the opening scenes establish a strange box which has the word 'Roswell' tattooed on it and contains a small, wrapped up body complete with hands not of this world. The skull that drives the characters is additionally shaped in a strange manner. Gee, I wonder what it could all point to. Did anyone else also notice what was arguably the worst use of a Wilhelm Scream in cinematic history?The rest of the casting is a little off as well. Taking an actor like John Hurt and casting him as a bumbling fool who constantly reminds us Indiana's real name is Henry purely for laughs is just daft as is the nasty attempt at creating some sort of spin off character with Mutt. The film sees the gang spend most of their time escaping from inescapable Soviet controlled situations and without much punishment. The film plods along with its story and one-liners but Spielberg's more interested in family related revelations Indy and co. are involved in. The climax is a non-event and we're probably not as angry as we would have been had it not been Indiana Jones. If a fifth film is ever made, it surely cannot be much worse than this one was.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
76,filipemanuelneto,"Mr. Spielberg wants aliens, and have to have them",3,16 May 2016,"In this film, the latest in Indiana Jones franchise so far, the explorer and archaeologist will go in search of the crystal skulls, objects about which abound myths. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film has screenplay by David Koepp and has Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf in the lead roles.The script is the main problem of this film, totally unrealistic. The action scenes abused in computerized effects and eventually became so absurd that only lacked some laser swords to the characters during the fencing scene. There is still a certain character, ""Professor Oxley"", played by John Hurt, that I don't know what the hell is doing for 90% of the movie because he's left in the plot. And this kind of basic errors multiplied by the script. Harrison Ford still doesn't accuse the weight of his age, managing to fulfill his role in a very good way, but in a film that doesn't do justice to his talent. The stunning scenery are in accordance with the script, and are as unbelievable as it. The picture is very good, perhaps the best of the franchise to date, as well as special visual and sound effects, unsurprisingly. The soundtrack fulfilled her role without much brilliance.I will never be able to understand why Spielberg almost cannot make a film without involving extraterrestrials. Is himself an alien giving clues to the human race in blockbuster movies? When directors want to impose by force an idea into a script this is what happens: Spielberg likes sci-fi, and is not able to keep it away from movies that don't belong to that style. This film, lamentably, is a confusing and boring mix of Indiana Jones and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", soaked with computerized effects as if Spielberg had never seen a computer before. I regret that the film hasn't been lost in the forest before finding theaters or our technology doesn't allow Mr. Spielberg to go for a ride to Mars, on a one-way trip, if he comes back trying to shove aliens where they are not needed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
77,leplatypus,It's more the Kingdom of Scully (Screen),7,24 May 2008,"No matter if the title seems too trivial, the story a bit complicated, Indy performing too much unconceivable stunts, John Williams without inspiration, this saga (as ""Star Wars"") remains a movie milestone and a family entertainment: The family missed ""Raiders"" at screen, but we were there for ""Temple of Doom"" (10 years old) & ""Last Crusade"" (15 years old).Nearly 20 years after, Indy returns for maybe his truly ""last crusade"" this time and every one of us show the passing of time: white hairs, a bit rusty, and as said in the movie,""life starts to take more and give less""!In regard to the movies, our memories are respected: From ""Raiders"", you got the pace & look of the movie, from ""Temple"", you got the subterranean dark trip, from ""Crusade"", you got the familial touch...It would be interesting to know if ""Skull"" fits with the ""Young Indy"" show also, especially with the episode in which Harisson appears. This time, Indy deals with the greatest mystery of humanity which have been addressed a lot of time by other movies: its finale looks exactly as the finale of another great movie (follow my title, X-Files!)It's a pity that there isn't any deep reflexion from the only man who witnesses both powers of ""Gods"" and ""Aliens"". In relation to the weight of religions for centuries and the character's philosophy, this new perspective could have been better handled.But, i must admit that the producers beat me with linking aliens to primitive gods, as a great book implies ""Rule by Secrecy"".Indeed, months ago, this review should have been my 100th (and not my 144th), because i wanted then to write about an unreleased movie and thus, my most awaited movie! I don't know for other fans, but I guessed then, all the background: real time for the character since the last movie (1938+19=1957!) - Russian time - Roswell I don't remember the mythology I have associated (maybe Arabic for a change).So, a page seems to be well turned because there isn't any great mysteries to solve, except his own family life!

The characters and story are uninteresting. The action is over-the-top but who cares. ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" plays like an unfunny spoof.

79,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Fourth ""Jones"" entertains, but doesn't recapture the magic",7,22 May 2008,"The one-liners, the dazzling locales, the raw sexual tension (and appeal), the inventive action sequences, the wit--these are the things ""Indiana Jones"" fans know and love about this film franchise and its beloved hero, Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr, and naturally that's what they've come to expect--even 19 years later--from the fourth installment. But that's not the forte of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Instead, it's a mildly entertaining, more visually refined and mythology-focused take on Indy that lacks the charm and irrepressible love the past films evoked.""Crystal Skull"" lets its premise hold it down. While ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Last Crusade"" only took one 5 minute scene to explain the ancient artifacts involved and the stories behind them, ""Crystal Skull"" takes constant moments here and there to keep the viewer up to speed with what exactly it's all about. It's necessary to understand the film, but it takes too much time away from the fun parts of the franchise. It's definitely interesting though: the idea that the South American legend of ""El Dorado,"" a city of gold, was created by an ancient civilization who worshipped an extra-terrestrial life form. It sticks to the supernatural nature of the artifacts like in the other movies, but it's simply way too complex. The premise really forced George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson to write the script almost entirely to accommodate it.One of those things that get shorted for plot's sake and something that never should get that way is character development. The characters in this film get thrown in as the plot roles along and we're supposed to act like we understand the bond they all share. The rekindled relationship between Marion (Allen) and Indy in particular is one of those relationships that never really has time to establish itself. Rising star Shia Lebouf isn't bad in the film and neither is Cate Blanchett as the antagonist, but neither role enhances the enjoyment of the film. Even Indy himself has lost some of his swagger. Ford doesn't deserve to be faulted entirely for the disappearance of the command that his performance had over the original trilogy. Indiana appears to be written more as the nerdy professor in this film instead of a dash of professor as used in the trilogy.The film still has the series' action and creativity through action. It's not nearly as exciting and innovative because the plot limits the possibilities, but it's entertaining. The witty dialogue however is not nearly as frequent. The humor of ""Temple of Doom,"" especially in the characters is not even close to matched in this film. You can tell they're trying to be that way, but it doesn't work the same because the character development is lacking.It's hard to knock an Indiana Jones film, but it's safe to say this film was the worst of the four, unless you never could take how bizarre the plot for ""Temple of Doom"" was. It can easily be said this movie entertains through the action, the riddles and the mild intrigue of the premise, but it almost entirely fails to take advantage of the fact that its basic foundation is one that the public fell in love with over 20 years ago. It never uses that to suck the audience in except in a few scenes, mostly involving fedoras or snakes. You shouldn't hate ""Crystal Skull,"" but you could very easily be disappointed. Anyone who is unfamiliar with the franchise is quite frankly best served by holding off on spending the cash and renting the other three first.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

81,funkyfry,"Not as bad as some say, or as good as most would hope",5,19 July 2008,"Well, they brought the venerable Indiana Jones back to life for another installment. Personally I was never a huge fan of the movies. I thought the best part of any of them was when River Phoenix played Indy in the prelude part of the third movie. But they were fun enough at the time. This one feels pretty stale, although it starts out well. Blanchett is very sexy in the military uniform, but she's really too good of an actress to be in a one dimensional role like that. The whole thing with Shia LaBeouf was kind of fun at first, but only a mental midget or a 5 year old would have been fooled by the big ""revelation."" The biggest surprise here is that so many of the big scenes, like that revelation scene, are so stale. The quicksand set looks like a set for a Monogram jungle adventure movie. The worst part of the movie by far is the whole sequence that takes place right after that, the car chase through the jungle. What the heck was that with swinging on the vines, and then why did the monkeys attack Blanchett and her associates? Those are some discerning monkeys, they hate commies! I know this isn't supposed to be a ""realistic"" movie, but why put in silly stuff like that? The whole thing with the ants felt like I've seen it in other movies. Even the big ending scenes were something that felt very ho hum to me.Ray Winstone's character was handled in a very inept way, as if the film-makers didn't even care about how transparent they were being. Of course it could be just along the lines of typical B movie stuff. Sometimes in old B movies they would make the ""villain"" so obvious that you have to believe it was done that way so that kids in the audience would feel smart by guessing it. But at the very least you'd hope the character would make sense. John Hurt is a lot better, yet somehow he isn't on the movie poster but Winstone is. Hurt was so deep into his character I didn't recognize him until the very end and that ridiculous wedding scene. He's an awesome actor.The presence of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies is sorely missed. It was nice to see Karen Allen back in the mix though. What more can I say? This wasn't supposed to be a great movie. None of the Indiana Jones movies are great in my opinion. This was a fun movie but nothing particularly memorable. I do like that they brought in all these ideas about aliens and archeology, reminds me of ""Chariots of the Gods."" I love that the first thing you hear in the movie is Elvis Presley, and these kids in a hot rod racing down the highway. It was a blast from the past, not the real past necessarily but the cinema past of Lucas' ""American Graffiti."" The scene with the fight in the soda bar was fun in the same way. Lucas sure does have a lot of barfights in his movies.This was the best they could do, really. It was more entertaining in a lot of ways than the new Star Wars movies were. Spielberg is a better director, even if there's nothing really new here. For example, he lifted the image of them going into the insane asylum, with the disembodied arms reaching out of the cells, from ""Bedlam."" I think fans of the series should be very pleased with this movie, it could have been a lot worse.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
82,southdavid,Righteous Gem-Domes,5,6 March 2020,"My young sons recent interest in Indiana Jones (from the Lego games) inspired me to stick on this much maligned film at the weekend - mostly as it's the only one without some horrific scene that will scar him for life seeing it at this age. I'm afraid the question isn't really, ""Is it good?"" As much as it's ""How bad is it?"" For me, the answer is ""not as bad as you remember"", but it's pretty underwhelming.Captured by Russian agent Irana Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and dragged to Area 51, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is forced against his will to locate what appears to be an Alien body recovered from a crash a decade earlier. Escaping their clutches, Jones meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who tells him that his old friend Oxley (John Hurt) has been imprisoned in Peru having become obsessed with El Dorado and Crystal Skulls. Jones and Mutt set out to find what happened to him.As good as it is to see Harrison Ford don the hat again, it's a shame that, for the moment, this is the lasting memory of the franchise. It's not terrible, obviously, it's a Steven Spielberg film - it's wonderfully and dynamically shot, the effects are sometimes decent, the music and editing are good. Everything is technically passable.However, every so often, the film does something so blisteringly stupid it undoes the good work that it does in between. Chief amongst them is, of course, the Fridge nuking - an idea so dire it's entered the general lexicon. It's not alone, however; saving Indy from the quicksand with a patently rubber snake, Mutt swinging through the jungle are amongst other examples. Some of the action scenes are pretty strong, with the multi-vehicle-Jungle-fight-chase being pretty good, but the whole finale is pretty disappointing.It feels like it was a regularly rewritten script, dashed out to make an arbitrary deadline rather than a genuine labour of love for anyone involved. My expectation is not high, but I hope that Jones 5 can make up for this somehow.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

They cherish the old series in their heart and have troubles with a new edition for reasons of sentiment I guess.

84,jzappa,In Spite of Its Painfully Outdated Corniness,6,15 September 2008,"The Indiana Jones movies have all been directed by the infinitely skillful Steven Spielberg and written by George Lucas and a petite defense force of screenwriters enacting protection against Lucas's lack of dialogue skill, although they are present in a nostalgic time space of their own. Roger Ebert, master of the most cerebral possible way of looking at movies, said in his review, which I just read, ""All you can do is compare one to the other three. And even then, what will it get you? If you eat four pounds of sausage, how do you choose which pound tasted the best?"" Ebert, who clearly would have made a great human factors psychologist had he not become a movie critic, has an astute point here, because that indeed is the effect of the Indiana Jones movies, but he seemed to think that this fourth installment was comparable, hence his analogy of sausage and whatnot in his recent review of it.Just a few seconds ago, I thought of comparing this to the disastrous Live Free or Die Hard, another fourth installment to a classic action-adventure trilogy that came over a decade after trilogy history was already made. But this I will not do. The first reason is that Spielberg and Lucas did not only do Indiana Jones 4 to cash in on a kazillion-dollar franchise that its fanatics thought had concluded. This could hardly be corroborated by the fact that unlike most film franchises, Indiana Jones is distributed by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, George Lucas's bloated Lucasfilm. The pre-production deal between the two companies contracted Paramount merely receive 12.5% of the film's returns. As the $185 million budget was swollen from the initial $125 million assessment, Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford rejected generously proportioned straight salaries so Paramount could deal with the production costs. So that Paramount could, I don't know, maybe see a profit further than its distribution fee, the movie had to make over $400 million. Then Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford collect their cut. Nevertheless! They had a fourth Indiana in mind for about as long I have been alive. The second reason is that Live Free or Die Hard was terrible, and this is not.In spite of Crystal Skull's painfully outdated corniness, there are some pretty exciting scenes involving human-eating ants, swordfights between two people balanced on the backs of jeeps which speed through a rainforest, big caves of gold, lots of monkeys, Russian femmes fatale, an urban motorcycle chase, nosedives through three waterfalls one after the other, and the clarified validation of flying saucers. What's more, Spielberg opens the picture with a long, swooping steadicam take diving onto a desert road and encircling wildly playful automobiles. Everyone's cheap jokes about Harrison Ford's age are now proved to be wrong beyond the simple taking of one's word for it being a ridiculous assumption, though I am guilty of a small handful of those jokes, like the one about his gut pushing through the buttons of his shirt while he's swinging on his strained rope, perhaps affecting his arthritis. Ford is the very same Indy he was nineteen years before he left to be the middle-aged yet swiftly lethal President of the United States in Air Force One, or the sixtysomething yet swiftly lethal bank security specialist in Firewall, or for god's sake Jack Ryan in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, which were succeeded by the half as old Ben Affleck in his place.However, this particular hero journey could never be close to par with its three timeless predecessors. Spielberg has too adamantly preserved the very manner of film-making and storytelling that he employed in 1981, 1984 and 1989. We grew up with those films and whether or not they live entirely in their own dimension, we are still aware of their time in the era of American cinema. In 2008, you cannot make the same kind of action-adventure movie that you made in the 1980s. There is hence a featherweight impact to the movie, and the innate suspension of disbelief is relegated to aloofness.At his advanced age, John Hurt's eccentric professor untiringly leaps from one speeding vehicle to the other and endures through fire, inundation and falling from countless elevations. Associations relating specific other characters are detaching, in view of the fact that the likelihood of them stumbling upon each other is in the negatives, despite that the likelihood of them not stumbling upon each other in this movie is limitless. Cate Blanchett is totally wasted in her completely silly role, the script conforms to the formula it partook in creating over time, and the movie turns out to be underwhelming. But hey, my generation gets to do what yours did: Go into a multiplex to hear John Williams's immortal score over Indy's sensational exploits, rather than watching it on a hand-me-down VHS in the basement.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
85,Vartiainen,Stumbles on the details,6,19 June 2015,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a fine idea on principle. All of the Indiana Jones movies were standalone films, meant to be enjoyed on their own. And thus it stands to reason that there's no limit on how many there should be. And even if there is a large gap between this and the Last Crusade, that doesn't mean that you couldn't tell an Indiana Jones story.What makes this simply an average movie, instead of an instant classic like the original trilogy, is the execution. The details simply don't work. And no, I'm not even that bothered by the whole Area 51/Roswell vibe that the movie has. It takes place in the late 50s, so it's only logical to include those elements. Personally I would have picked something different, like Norse mythology, or even something actually historic, but it's a valid choice on paper.And most of the actors work as well. Harrison Ford is as great as ever as Indiana Jones. There are perhaps one too many jokes about how old he is, but those jokes were coming anyway, so you kind of expected them. And it's actually pretty cool to see Karen Allen again. Full points for that idea, even if the execution is a bit overly mushy.The biggest problem, however, in my opinion, is Shia LaBeouf. They're clearly trying to set up a franchise here. Sequels. The old Indiana Jones retires and his successor picks up the bull whip and the hat. However... Shia LaBeouf, really? I know he was kind of hot stuff at the time, but... really? Most of the movie is simply setting him up as the successor, and it just doesn't work. You don't buy that this schmuck could ever be the next Indiana Jones.So that kind of kills the movie already, but if that doesn't do it for you, the sequel acceleration will finish the job. What's sequel acceleration, you ask? It's the phenomenon where a sequel tries to do the exact same thing that made the original film so popular, but with more oomph and over-the-topness. The latter two films of the original trilogy neatly avoided this, but this film blows it out of the park. Half of the action scenes are ridiculously ludicrous, the villains are hammier than ever, the emotions are constantly on surface and as a whole it feels more like a parody of Indiana Jones than an actual Indiana Jones movie.It's not a bad film. If you didn't have the original trilogy to compare this to, you might even call it a good film. But it sorely misses what made the original trilogy so captivating and its heart is not in the right place. It has a lot of good elements, but the Indiana Jones fan in you will cry whenever LaBeouf is on screen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

87,robert-temple-1,Rip-Roarin' Fantasy Adventure,8,2 December 2008,"You have to realize this is all ridiculous, and just sit back and enjoy it. The notion that anything at all in or about the film would make any kind of logical sense is unthinkable. This latest Indiana Jones caper is somewhat less frenetic than the Temple of Doom and the Lost Ark. Thrills come once every five seconds instead of once every two seconds, which gives us time to breathe. And if you miss a bit of the head-bashing and sword-slashing, well it doesn't matter, as there is plenty of time for making coffee while the endless adventures progress. Harrison Ford is as good as ever and really it doesn't matter that he has aged, it really doesn't. The young actor Shia LaBoeuf (who clearly is no vegetarian) does very well as the son of Indiana Jones (he even out-does Johnnny Weissmuller at swinging on vines between the trees of the rain forest), and maybe he is being groomed to take the place of Ford. (Better to replace a Ford than a Lincoln.) Good old Cate Blanchett, there she is, being someone else this time. Now she is a rapier-eyed protégé of Stalin specializing in the paranormal. Well, I can believe that, she has always looked paranormal to me. I am prepared to swallow her hook line and sinker anytime. Has she ever done anything bad? I think not, as she is just as versatile as Meryl Streep ever was. The film contains a great deal of silliness, but who cares. There are a lot of good gags, and humour is everywhere, spread all over the story like peanut butter. This is just fun. Why worry? P.S. At least they mentioned F. A. Mitchell-Hedges in passing. P.P.S. And I do have to complain that the prop used for the alien crystal skull was appalling. Why spend zillions on a film and then use a cheap central prop? Production error!!

88,FiendishDramaturgy,"Fun, thanks to Shia and Karen...",6,21 May 2008,"A ""passing the torch"" movie starring Shia Lebouf and Harrison Ford.Who knew? Well, besides me, I mean...who knew Harrison Ford was just too old to be Indiana Jones again? What made that statement to you? Was it the loose-skin-jowls wagging as he ran? Was it his moobs jiggling as he trotted? (GET A BRO!) Was it the cords called the ""elevens"" standing out prominently along the back of his neck? This was just sad. I had to try to enjoy it for Shia's sake...it's not every day a young up-coming star is handed a franchise this big (where will this leave Transformers?), so as somewhat of an admirer of his talent, I tried to like this film, and for his contribution, I did. But Harrison Ford cracking jokes on his own behalf, making fun of his advanced age as an adventurer? His self depreciating banter was disheartening, at best. He should have remained in the university and let the kid have the whole movie.In all honesty, this is so sad I don't think it will make it into my collection. Cate was a sheer disaster! No depth, no...anything. *sigh* But to be honest, Ford knew he was too old to do this, and Spielberg knew he didn't care and was going to make it anyway. At least they have Shia to whom they can pass the torch. That is a GOOD thing.All in all? If you're a fan of the originals, you will find a certain amount of nostalgic melancholy in this work, and it may not be in a good way. If you're not a fan of the originals, you will not like this on any level, as even the element of nostalgia will be absent, therefore, leaving you with nothing with which to connect...but it's fun, thanks to Karen's return, and the addition of Shia. It would have been better I think, without Ford.It may not be appropriate for younger children for some downright tense moments, but there is nothing really ""scary"" about this. Not from my point of view, anyway. Children are frightened of the weirdest things, sometimes.The guys will laugh at the various inadequacies of the script (they waited 19 years for this?!)including a nuclear explosion which was a total disgrace, some cheesy over the top spider-monkey-on-crack action sequences at the end, and because of Indys age... but the girls will love watching a beefed-up Shia.It rates a 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
89,elshikh4,Do Many Dumb Points in a Movie Make it Dumb ?!,7,29 October 2009,"To answer, let's review these points first:_(Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull): Very long, very silly title to begin with!_Once upon time, in July 2007, I read that: ""producer Frank Marshall stated that the film would be shot the same way as the previous three - with stunt men, and using CGI only when necessary"". Well, he lied!There was too many, too provocative CGI; starting with the huge door of the governmental warehouse, to the whole car chase in the jungle, ending with the monkeys, the ants, and the squirrels. I even suspect that Shia LaBeouf himself is CGI! With this abundance, the movie turns into another easy action, losing what distinguished it once. Moreover, I felt pity for the low level of it many times, while seeing silver diaphanous lines surrounding the characters during the action. Grrrr! This is directed by Steven Spielberg. The man who made 15 years earlier Jurassic Park where the CGI was perfect, historically perfect. Here, the names of Spielberg, Locus, and Indy hadn't become a motto for high quality any more!_This plot! Yes, it's catchy, new and original; with Russians, Aliens, and a skull to control minds. But the third act is a complete farce. Who can buy things like space between spaces, the fact that the aliens came back to life, the dumb end of the evil girl.. etc. This is forced gibberish. I must admit one, truly clever, line said by one reviewer here in the IMDb, saying that this movie is nothing but ""Tarzan meets X Flies""! In fact, I read somewhere that George Lucas was the one who selected the script. Well, by all means, I don't trust Mr. George-new-Star-Wars-trilogy-Lucas's taste AT ALL!_The action didn't pay off for the long sequences of talking sometimes. I noticed that the start wasn't hot enough; why they didn't show the capturing of Dr. Jones in the Mexican desert first, with good action intro?? And I think that the car chase in the jungle was better than the climax, which makes that last one a bit disappointing!_You'll remember many movies while watching. That was for nobody's good, as Indy movies used to be so authentic. Among them: The Mummy (the shot in which the guy wants all the gold). Close Encounters of the Third Kind (the aliens' looks). Raiders of the Lost Ark (the death of the evil guys with exploding their eyes by powerful spirits). And (X Flies: Fight The Future).. I won't tell you where!_The secret agent thing! Is it a way to understand that Indy hates Russians? Is it a way to utilize that later in a TV series? And originally how and when he became a military Colonel?! Which directly leads us to the next Dumb point.._Where was the CIA all along?! Rather where were the FBI guys who were nagging Indy in the start, warning him that they're keeping their eyes on him??!!_Although she didn't lose her magical smile, but (Karen Allen) aged badly!_The atomic bomb?? I know that Spielberg wants to mark the 1950s, kind of dishonor the age of the bomb, as he did in Empire of The Sun, and using it to make an action victory; as his lead can't be harmed even by an atomic bomb. But sorry. Not the matter of the refrigerator that bugged me. Rather the matter of a whole fake town while its TV is on, the dying of the martial team while escaping, and the fact that the government is so dumb to explode an atomic bomb right near the warehouse which has all of its invaluable secrets???!!!_The 3 downs. OH MY GOD. That was too much even by Indy's measures. Especially when the characters survived without one scratch later! Why they didn't say that the skull saved them?!_It's slight point but: HOW ALL THE GOOD GUYS WERE SAVED FROM ALL OF THESE BULLETS FOR GOD'S SAKE?! Anyhow, this is the slight point!I believe Spielberg made it just for happy rumination, to assure that he still have it. But while he, along with most of his buddies, still really have it, I think he lost things along the way.""No, in this case they could make it not that smart, or less entertaining"": This is the answer to my title's question!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
90,DarkVulcan29,"We are getting older, but the Indiana Jones films are always gonna be enjoyable.",10,28 May 2008,"I did not think it was gonna happen, I thought Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade(1989) would be the final Indiana Jones film. But after years of fans asking will there be another Indiana Jones film, and will Harrison Ford reprise the role. We'll the wait is over and the questions are finally answered. Harrison Ford reprises the role, dons the hat and the whip. It's 1957 and Indy is off on another adventure in search for a Crystal Skull, and learning about the mysteries that surround it, with a new sidekick named Mutt Williams(Shia Lebouf), they must discover it's secrets, or will it fall into the wrong hands? I liked Karen Allen reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood from the first one, she really brought a lot of enjoyment in the film. So did Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.

91,generationofswine,These are Not Tears of Joy,1,1 September 2013,"I took the whole Indiana Jones thing too far. I was obsessed with him as a child & as an adult, well even with age the seeds we were planted & I chose my college major around Indiana Jones.He made history cool. And Archeology fascinatingly fun, even if you never get shot at & spend most of your time sweating in the sun with little to show for it but dirt. Even though you aren't fighting Nazis, you still get to play Indiana Jones.The thing is, Archeologists, historians, they search for the remains of human civilizations. Religion play an enormous role in human civilization. Everyone on the face of the earth is touched by religion, even if they don't practice any given religion, the symbolism is everywhere & they live in a culture created by it.What they do not live in, despite what ""Ancient Aliens"" & The History Channel will tell you, is a culture created by Aliens. They are not a part of either history or archeology.Even if you don't believe in a God, you believe that religion is real, you can't look at a church & believe nothing is there. That is a part of culture & religious artifacts are a big part of archeology because they were a big part of everyday life.Aliens were not. The new installment left history & human culture at the door. When I watched Raiders as a child, I wanted to be an archaeologist, it was tangible, it had a strong effect on me. If I would have seen this piece instead, my entire life would have turned out different. I would have been stuck trying to figure out how to make a living as a Jedi.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
92,ebiros2,Best of the Indiana Jones movie !!,10,19 April 2009,"I liked this movie. I don't understand why people are comparing this to the first three and saying it's a crap (and no, I'm not associated with Paramount or Spielberg in any way). Spielberg keeps the theme contemporary with UFO (Indiana Jones finally moves into post war era, and post Roswell era), Psi spies ( CIA's Stargate project, remote viewing), and the crystal skull (Hedges crystal skull), and ties them together into an epic adventure. The action and humor is over the top as usual, but it seems to be even bigger with this movie. From the very beginning where the car blows past a prairie dog blasting ""Hound Dog"" to where Jones survives the nuclear blast, the humor and the speed the story keeps moving is unlike any movie made in the past 20 years. The outrageous sword fight scene in the jungle, and the waterfall scene was another great over the top entertainment.I just think people are getting too analytical, and everything must be detail oriented to meet approval. Why can't adventure movie be just that - an adventure movie ? I loved this movie. It was fun, it was exciting, it was intriguing, and I thought it was superbly crafted. Steven Spielberg came back from the dead after making a dismal crap like the War of the Worlds, and I hope he'd make another installment of this series if he has ideas that'll top this one !",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
93,dfranzen70,Weathered Indy storms into theaters,8,24 May 2008,"For all practical purposes, the long-awaited fourth Indiana Jones is solid, gutsy, sincere entertainment, successfully placing an aging, breaking-down hero against a backdrop of wild locations, living-dead assassins, evil Commies, and returning love interests. Harrison Ford, looking every one of his 65 years (but that’s okay - because that’s how old Dr. Jones is, too), is really terrific as the intrepid professor/archaeologist; it looks like he’s hardly been away from the role he last played in 1989. And his supporting cast is also top-notch, with one notable exception.The year is 1957, and as the movie opens a Russian commando has infiltrated a US base in New Mexico. Seems the Russkies - led by Cate Blanchett, in a cold, despicably evil performance - are looking for a certain crystal skull that can commute the usual incredible powers to whoever returns it to its rightful place. Of course, Jones quickly is involved, and his travels take him to the jungles of Peru (somewhat surprisingly, cocaine trafficking is not even mentioned as a plot device). Oh, but not before paying homage to a relic of the late 1950s, atomic-bomb testing. Yes, it’s Indy Jones in the Atomic Age! Unfortunately, we don’t get a sudden fifty-foot Dr. Jones with one eye.Indy’s not alone, naturally, that would be boring. Gone is Marcus Brody, since Denholm Elliott died in 1992, and Henry Jones Sr., since Sean Connery is retired from acting. Indiana has with him his partner Mac (Ray Winstone) and a new friend, a greaser (remember, 1957) named Mutt who insists his mom told him to find Jones, and since he hasn’t heard from his mom, who was looking for another friend, Dr. Oxley (John Hurt), Mutt believes he and Indy have to team up to find out what’s going on.First, let’s look at Ford. There are few actors who have had the monumental pop-cultural impact that Ford’s had. He’s been Han Solo, Jack Ryan, and Indiana Jones. He’s been in nine movies with just those three characters, and his movies have made billions - and yet the man himself has exactly one Oscar nomination (for Working Girl). His wry looks and grim determination haven’t faded much over the years, and he makes this role work simply because you can believe Indy would look just like that after two decades have passed. Ford knows what makes for effective acting; you want your audience to completely buy into everything your character does, as if they were in your character’s shoes. And one thing that the Indiana Jones films do that other action films don’t is that they eschew most action-guy bon mots and stunts that stretch plausibility past its breaking point. And remember, Harrison Ford does most of his own stunts, too.His supporting cast gels quite nicely, all things considered. Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood, whom we haven’t seen since the original Raiders of the Lost Ark. Allen’s been out of work for four years now and didn’t have much of a career even after RotLA, but she looked good here, and more importantly she had excellent chemistry with Ford. Winstone and Hurt, both fine actors, are pretty good here as well - although Winstone’s rough British accent is indecipherable at times, and Hurt’s character has very little to say (he’s mad, you see) until very late in the film.Perplexing is the decision to cast Shia LaBeouf has bad-boy Mutt Williams, though. LaBeouf was entertaining in Transformers, but he has the face of an innocent little lamb, not Vinne Barbarino. So more like Arnold Horshack. He can’t act tough; he can barely imagine tough. LaBeouf looks like he’s trying to play dress up at a particularly lame Halloween party, but then our luck changes; in South America, he’s suddenly Awesome Lad, able to help Old Man Jones fight off those nasty Reds.Any fan of the series will recognize some running gags - Indy’s fear of snakes, for one thing. And a fight at the edge of a cliff! And Indy getting interrupted while lecturing to his class, by the school’s new dean (Jim Broadbent)! There’s even a nod to Indy’s insistence that old stuff belongs in a museum, as Blanchett’s evil minx Irina Spalko tries to entice the unwavering scientist with visions of gifts to museums. She’s quite touching, that Irina.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is far brighter and flat-out fun than 1984’s Temple of Doom, and it’s more actiony and dramatic than 1989’s Last Crusade; the only movie to which it pales in comparison is the original, and there’s nothing Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, or George Lucas could do to prevent that. The fourth installment is genuine adventure, complete with a cohesive cast and some jaw-dropping action sequences.So there you have it. Not pedestrian, not lame, not boring. Quite good, really. An outstanding effort that’s (as usual) best appreciated on the big screen, although with so many large-screen TVs about nowadays, watching at home should be just as intense.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
94,PWNYCNY,"A long, dumb movie.",2,28 May 2008,"Is this movie science fiction? Action adventure? A pseudo-documentary on archeology? A statement about UFOs? If a movie can be said to reflect the director's state of mind, then the director must have been muddled. This movie is part National Treasure, part ET, part Close Encounters of the Third Kind, part Wild Bunch, part Earth vs. the Flying Suacers, part Keystone Cops and part The Mummy. The story is dumb, the special effects are laughable, the acting is stilted and literary license is taken to an extreme. It is hard to believe that Stephen Spielberg actually directed this cinematic cacophony. It is hard to believe that anyone directed this tribute to artistic banality. This movie represents the current low state of artistic creativity in Hollywood. Bad story? No problem! Just give the audience a strong dose of special effects! They'll love it! (Yeah. Right.) If you like scenes with monkey-like humanoids, rampaging Soviet spies, swarming ants, defoliation of a jungle (with the Soviets as the culprits), a college professor who instantly goes from being senile to articulate, and probably the most embarrassing performance in Cate Blanchett's career, then this movie is for you. One other point. This movie portrays the Russians as brutish, gun totting idiots. This kind of cultural insensitivity is simply unfair. For all of you who are weak in history, the Russians were VICTIMS of Nazi aggression, and were ALLIES of the United States during World War Two.Actually this movie most closely resembles the 2004 movie Alexander in terms of its oddity, scope, weirdness and mediocrity. Lots of effort to make a block buster but with little to show for it except lots and lots of ludicrous special effects. Whose idea was it anyway to have Cate Blanchett play a nasty Russian? It did not work; was not even funny. (How about this for a suggestion: Why not have a Russian actress play the nasty Russian? Oops! Sorry. That would have meant having to re-write parts of the script, re-do certain scenes, re-do other cast parts and actually portray the Russians in a less hysterical manner.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
95,ackstasis,"""I've got a bad feeling about this.""",7,23 May 2008,"Many people are so utterly overwhelmed by nostalgic childhood memories of the original ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy that they forget how extraordinarily silly the films actually were. An endearing homage to the cheesy adventures serials of the 1930s, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)' was low-brow entertainment of the highest order, and audiences were immediately entranced by Harrison Ford's rugged, handsome, tenacious, whip-cracking treasure-hunter. Such was the skill of director Steven Spielberg's execution that audiences were quite willing to accept any implausibilities raised by Lawrence Kasdan's ripping screenplay, and the resultant picture remains one of the most entertaining films ever made. Two impressive and financially-successful sequels followed, and I must be one of the few who believes 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989),' thanks largely to the inspired casting of Sean Connery, to be the finest of the bunch. A poet could hardly have imagined a more perfect conclusion to Indiana Jones' travails than a majestic horseback departure against the backdrop of the setting sun but audiences wanted more, and we got it.It took the best part of two decades for everybody's favourite archaeologist to claw his way back onto our cinema screens, and Harrison Ford settles into the role exceedingly well. With a wry smile and the occasional well-chosen wisecrack, Dr. Jones has changed little in the twenty years since we last saw him, and a new era in United States history has abandoned his old foes, the Nazis, and brought him in contact with the rising tide of Communism. Accordingly, the style of film-making has cleverly shifted from the adventure serials of the 1930s to the B-movie sci-fis of the 1950s, complete with anti-Russian propaganda, government conspiracies and visitors from another world  subject matter with which Spielberg is certainly not unfamiliar. Our primary villain this time around is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), a sinister Russian psychic researcher whose fanatical quest for knowledge overwhelms any genuine feelings of mercy or compassion. Though nostalgia forbids her from even approaching the likes of Rene Belloq, Mola Ram or Walter Donovan, Blanchett is very effective as Stalin's creepy disciple.'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)' is not the masterpiece that many have been anticipating, but neither is it the disaster that most had been expecting. For the first half of the film, Spielberg hardly puts a foot wrong, and I was ecstatic with the spectacle, action and humour of Indy's return to cinema. The Paramount logo fading into a smaller ""mountain"" than usual, the ultra-magnetic wooden chest in the vast military warehouse, our hero surviving a breathtaking atomic bomb blast by taking cover in a lead-insulated refrigerator!  it was all brilliant old-fashioned entertainment, and I rejoiced that Spielberg and Lucas has been able to remain loyal to the series' previous entries. Whatever misgivings I might have had about newcomer Shia LaBeouf playing Indy's sidekick were quickly extinguished, and I found Mutt Williams to be highly entertaining, a classic 1950s greaser who might have stepped straight out of Lucas' own 'American Graffiti (1973).'But did I speak too soon? Despite frequent assurances that old-school optical effects would take prominence over computer-generated imagery, the frenetic jeep chase through the Peruvian jungle, which started promisingly enough, thoroughly stretched my patience. The image of Shia straddled between two moving vehicles, and simultaneously sparring with Blanchett's master swords-woman, was to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in cinematic matters a competent faculty could ever buy into it. The army of flesh-eating ants was certainly not without interest, though obviously derived from the scarabs in Stephen Sommers' 'The Mummy (1999),' and that the group survived the three waterfall drops is improbable but not outside the realm of credibility {we are, after all, talking about a series in which Indy survived jumping out of an aeroplane using an inflatable raft}. A lot less forgivable is the revival of Tarzan in the form of Shia LaBeouf, complete with screeching CGI monkeys  when did it become unfashionable to simply borrow real animals from the zoo?Even with all its flaws, the latter half of 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' achieves a satisfactory level of entertainment, though it's such a drop-off from the stupendous opening acts that I can't help feeling disappointed. The climax  always a highlight in the Indiana Jones pictures  is an incredibly messy affair, poorly-plotted and overwhelmed by unconvincing visuals. The previous films, however credible their special effects, had an indescribable charm that I couldn't detect here  is it something that develops over time? Will I be less critical in another ten years? Even so, the film is still worth watching, not least due to an impressive cast of talented performers, including Ford, Blanchett, LaBeouf, Karen Allen {delightfully reprising the role of Marion Ravenwood from the first film}, Ray Winstone {his character underdeveloped, but enjoyable, as a possible ally or possible traitor} and John Hurt {who does his utmost in the limited capacity of a doddering eccentric}. Denholm Elliott, who passed away in 1992, is lovingly homaged by the filmmakers, and posthumously contributes his bit towards foiling the Communist enemy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
96,dee.reid,"An excellent ""Kingdom""",9,14 October 2008,"The new Indiana Jones movie, ""Indiana and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" is about one thing: proving that old-timers like Harrison Ford as the two-fisted title character still have it in them to throw a few good, solid punches here and there. Of course ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is the latest in a long line of reinvigorated franchise action movies that are proving that their aged stars still have a few punches left in them (""Rocky Balboa,"" ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" ""Rambo"" - you get the picture).""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is the first time the now-66-year-old Ford has stepped into the character since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" back in 1989. Director Steven Spielberg proves with this latest entry, written by David Koepp (with a story co-authored by ""Star Wars"" George Lucas), that while the film still has its share of flaws and is a bit confusing regarding the nature of the eponymous ""Crystal Skull,"" it is still nonetheless an exciting, edge-of-your seat adventure thrill ride of the first order.In short, it's about as much fun at the movies that you're likely to have this year.Instead of battling Nazis (like good ol' Indy did in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Last Crusade""), Our Hero is now fighting the communists, under the leadership of the venomous Ukrainian Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (the venomous and surprisingly well-cast Cate Blanchett), who are in search of the all-powerful crystal skull of Akator so that she can lead a super-powered army against the rest of the free world. (The plot, as confusing it is, does take a few nods in the direction of Indy films past.) Indy's fourth major globe-spanning odyssey takes him from Area 51 to the jungles of Peru and finally to an ancient Mayan temple, and reunites him with feisty ex Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, who hasn't lost any of that fire from ""Raiders""), her son, the wannabe-outlaw biker Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), and old colleague Professor Ox (John Hurt). And then there's also the two-timing George McHale (Ray Winstone).Of all the big-budget action movies out this summer, I have to say that ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was the most fun I've had watching the movies this summer. While I did miss this at the theater (so technically ""Iron Man"" was the most fun I had at the movies this summer), I had picked up the DVD today and was not at all disappointed by this rough-and-tumble action-adventure that proves that Ford, Lucas, Spielberg, and composer John Williams still have that definitive gift of movie magic in them. In terms of action sequences, they are all well-staged and accommodate the aged Ford excellently, proving that Spielberg still knows the delicate ins and outs of his craft. The best of these action sequences (with a little bit of aid from some good ol' CGI) is a truck chase through the jungle that brings back memories of that classic truck chase through the desert in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" except that this chase climaxes with an encounter with a horde of flesh-eating ants.Ford was excellent, as always, as Our two-fisted Hero. He's up in his age, all right, but that doesn't mean that we should automatically count him out. While LaBeouf is still a young and up-and-coming talent (and I'm not really a fan of him, by the way), you get the feeling that with this film's ending, the torch may be passed along to him some time in the near future (and that will be a real surprise). How many young guys his age will get a chance in their careers to be a part of a legendary cinematic legacy?It was nice to see another familiar face in this latest outing in the form of Karen Allen as Marion. She's still feisty and tough-as-nails for a female in this sort of Hollywood action-adventure (just like she was 27 years ago in ""Raiders""), and has aged quite well at the up-there age of 57. I remember reading her name on a poster for the movie earlier this year, and I just couldn't believe it: Marion's back! Needless to say, I was quite excited to see her thrown back into the action. Cate Blanchett wasn't miscast (as some have said), but she also wasn't bad either, even though I still do think she could have been more villainous. She's more proof that women - and femme fatals - in these movies can still be deadly and maintain a sense of their sexuality.All in all, if ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is indeed the last picture in this legendary cinematic legacy (from this film's ending and online rumors I've read, I doubt it), it was indeed a fun and exciting way to go out - I had a lot of the fun watching these movies myself - and this series will thus be committed to the annals of classic Hollywood history.9/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
97,JoeB131,Sometimes More is less,6,26 May 2008,"Now that I have had a little time to think about it, these were my main problems with the movie.1) Sometimes, more is less. They seemed to want to top the previous movies in terms of action sequences and special effects. That meant more CGI from ILM. More scenes obviously shot in front of Green Screens. More creepy-crawlies (Scorpions and carnivorous ants), three chase scenes. Two fistfights with the big scary Russian dude. Some bits were over the top, like Indy surviving a nuclear blast.2) An ineffective villain. Cate Blanchett's Irina Spalko just didn't exude the menace of The Nazis in Raiders and Crusade, nor the Thugees in Temple. She just wasn't scary, and at points looked silly, like when she tried to pretend to have psychic powers.3) I think another problem was that folks in Hollywood just don't think the Soviets were as evil as the Nazis, and tried to balance them off by saying 'McCarthyism was bad, too!"" Sorry, they weren't in the same league, really. The Soviets murdered millions of their own people, McCarthyism (the worst of which was actually well over by 1957, BTW) caused a few Hollywood lefties to lose their jobs for a few years. Okay, Hollywood, it's all about you, baby!4) Long in the tooth- Sorry,the problem with digital film making is that it made Harrison Ford and Karen Allen look like they were in their sixties, despite the best efforts to hide it. (Okay, Allen is only 57, but man, she looked it. Sorry, ladies, age is much crueler to you than it is to us.) 5) Are we numb to action sequences? When ""Temple of Doom"" came out, it was so intense that there were complaints the PG rating it got should have been an ""R"" rating. (The MPAA eventually created the PG-13 rating as a compromise.) The bar on action sequences have risen since then that we are just numb to them now.Now, I'm not saying it was a bad film, because it had its enjoyable moments. However, it wasn't nearly as good as the ones that proceeded it. Keeping up with the Joneses, if you will pardon the pun, isn't what it used to be.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
98,meeza,It is crystal clear that Kingdom of The Crystal Skull is a cool action-adventure flick,8,28 May 2008,"The Indy 500 is racing again! I am not referring to the Ferrari-inclined one but to the one that is Fedorically-inclined; in simplistic terms the proprietor one of one of the most legendary film characters of all time, Indiana Jones. Yes, Harrison Ford still is the thespian who fedoras Indy up for all of us! Mr. Jones is ""jonesing"" again for action adventure in the 4th installment of the epic franchise of Indiana Jones entitled ""Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"". The last Indiana sighting was almost twenty years ago so it is obvious that now Geriotol Jones, I mean Indiana Jones is no young pup. However, he can still whip up the same action adventure and mystical escapes as when he was a young raider in a lost ark. We see now Indy in 1957 still doing his ""part time"" archeology teaching thang and ""full time"" thrill seeker thang. Indy gets entangled with Soviet antagonists who want him to guide them to seek the wondrous Crystal Skull hidden somewhere in where else but Indiana. OK, so it is not Indiana! You are going to skull it up with the rest of the moviegoers to find out. The Soviet Unions are headed by a dominatrix-looking fem named Irina Spalko played by Cate Blanchett. Mr. Jones does partner up with a young spunky motorcycle-riding rebel named Mutt Williams in fighting the Soviets and more nemesis' along the way. Mutt might or might not be Jones' son, but I will not spoil it for you on whether Mutt is a mixed Jones breed or a purified extraneous. Mutt is played with buff spunk by Shia LaBeouf. Reunited and it feels so good because Marion County is again in Indyland like she should. Sorry that I got a little Peaches & Herb spa-zed out there, just wanted to say that ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"" main Indy gal Marion Ravenwood is back again in this latest Indy Marion-Go-Round. She is once again portrayed by Karen Allen. Indy mentor Professor ""Ox"" Oxley (John Hurt) and Indy friend/foe Mac Mchale (Ray Winstone) also hold court for the adventure as Indiana Pacers. Director Steven Spielberg and Executive Producer George Lucas do a far out job in bringing that nostalgic touch in classic Indy action scenes to ""Crystal Skull"" but did get a bit too ""alienated"" during the film's developing moments. We are though talking about the filmmakers of ""Star Wars"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", and ""E.T."". So Meeza phone home, it was expected! But to the Indiana franchise? Nevertheless, the spine-tingling action scenes of ""Crystal Skull"" filled my cranium with an exquisite adrenaline rush that will be in my head all summer long. Harrison Ford whipped it good once again as Indiana Jones; even with an older thespian whip! Was not cut out for Cate as Russian baddie here even though Blanchett can play just about any character! I also did not cope at times with David Koepp's convoluted screenplay. My archaeological sense concludes that ""Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"" rocks the Indy house but do not expect to totally roll in love with it. **** Good",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
99,drqshadow-reviews,"Oh, Indy...",4,4 April 2020,"Two decades after The Last Crusade, all the pieces finally fit back together for this long-awaited reunion between George Lucas, Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg. Tough to recapture the same old magic after so much time apart, but they actually manage to get it done... for a while. I can remember loathing this in the theater, avoided it for years on that merit, but my kids wanted to give it a try and I figured enough time had passed to give it another chance.The first hour is, shockingly, rather painless. A carefree romp that, admittedly, isn't on par with its distant relatives, but at least it's in the ballpark. We've got era-appropriate villains (the traditional Nazis smartly replaced by Russkis to fit the cold war), deep dives through crypts and libraries, warehouses stuffed with artifacts, whip-slinging physical action... even crotchety old man Ford seems to be having a great time. Hell, I didn't even mind a peak-overexposure Shia Labeouf, vacantly kicking around the screen as a greaser tagalong. Yes, the infamous nuke-fridge scene occurs during this part of the film, and it's still an eyeball-roller, but that's basically just a throwaway bit and the plot quickly moves to conceptually greener pastures. I found myself thinking, hey, maybe I was too harsh with that first watch.Then we reach the jungle and the wheels come off. Practical effects give way to glaring CG. Themes shift from the mythical to the absurd. Credibility goes sailing out the window. I know what Lucas and Spielberg were thinking. This is a series that's been built around stretches of the truth, poking and prodding reality until it doesn't seem so outlandish to be literally chasing the holy grail. They wanted to stick to that concept, push the envelope just a bit farther, play with the cheekier sci-fi concepts popularized during the late '50s. But man, oh man, did they misjudge. Somewhere between the vine-swinging tarzan monkeys, the trans-dimensional space aliens, the man-eating insects, the moving-vehicle swordfight and, yeah, that silly bit with the refrigerator, we shed our tenuous connection to the real world and lean into the ludicrous one. They've pressed their luck way too far, taken their audience out of the moment, and suddenly we've noticed the holes. Crystal Skull might not be quite as thorough a stinker as I'd remembered, but it's still bad.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
100,XweAponX,Not as hideous as I remembered.,10,11 September 2021,"And I liked the ""Mutt"" character.But they should have made Aliens, Aliens, instead of creating some ""interdimensional"" gobbledygook.Because every Indiana Jones movie has dealt with some kind of paranormal gimmick: and although nothing could beat that Ark from the first movie, The Thuggee gimmick from Temple of doom was also good (very Gunga-Din-Ish), as was searching for ""Indiana Python and the Holy Grail"".So with this film they should've just went straight out for aliens and Roswell and all that fun stuff. Because creating aliens and then calling them something else I'm pretty sure confused everybody.It was also a good idea to bring back Miriam Ravenwood, but kind of hide the fact initially with the MacGuffin of ""Mutts"" identity.It's just never a good idea to make an Indiana Jones movie where he actually meets aliens and then call them something else, that's pretty much why this didn't work as well.But as far as the quality of the movie, it was good and it had all the right kinds of gimmicks.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
101,alindsay-al,an average adventure that is like temple of doom.,5,22 September 2014,"With this film made 19 years since the last crusade there was both big expectations but also big worries leading to this film, but I think it is somewhere in between with this film being average similar to temple of doom instead of the fantastic films raiders of the lost ark and last crusade. The story sees an older Indiana Jones and young rebel mutt Williams attempt to return an ancient crystal skull to its birth place before the KGB can reveal its secrets. Harrison ford returns as Indiana Jones and even though he is an older version he is still great as Indiana Jones in my opinion can stay as Indy for at least one more adventure. He still has all of the characteristics that Indy has always had and he doesn't allow his age to get in the way of this. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag though, I must emphasise how much I disliked Shia laboeuf in his role as mutt. He Is a talented actor but I thought his character was annoying and his chemistry with ford wasn't that good either. Also Cate blanchett as irina spalko the Ukrainian KGB agent was just over the top and not a good villain with her intentions not seeming logical at all. There was some good performancees though with karen Allen's return as Marion being a great choice and her chemistry with ford is so good it feels like raiders again. Ray Winston also does a good job as Mac, indys old buddy who seems gold hungry and he also has good chemistry with ford. The story in this film is just abysmal and the reasoning for everybody's involvement just strikes desperation by Spielberg to get more characters in the film. The script is okay with the dialogue by the good characters enjoyable but the others are poor and adds to the less fun moments in this film. The style Is also mixed with the style of Indiana Jones still intact but there are some design choices with the style odd some moments that just leave you scratching your head and forgetting it's an Indiana Jones films. Overall it's an average film that is not good but also not completely terrible.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
102,MBunge,South Park got this thing exactly right,3,22 September 2010,"Alas, poor Indy, we knew you well. You were one of the greatest characters in movie history, star of one of the best films of all time and a couple of good sequels. But now, a couple of decades later, your creators have brought you back to the big screen. Your return, though, doesn't remind us of how much fun you used to be. Instead, you've been resurrected as a garish, shambling, poorly constructed Frankenstein.This is a dumb movie. How dumb? This movie has Soviet agents rampaging through 1950s America, yet it also references the hysterical anti-Communist paranoia of the McCarthy era. But if there were Soviet agents running wild through 1950s America, then it wasn't hysterical paranoia. The first 30 minutes of this film could have been called ""Indiana Jones Says Joe McCarthy Was Right"". This movie starts out with Professor Jones being suspended from teaching because of his politically questionable friendships, but it ends with him being named a high-ranking school administrator without any explanation for the change in status. This movie has a man survive the explosion of a nuclear bombBY HIDING INSIDE A Refrigerator. This movie doesn't even understand the basic concept of the Indiana Jones films, where Professor Jones is a mild-mannered intellectual in the civilized world who becomes a larger-than-life hero when he ventures into the foreign wilderness outside America. This movie starts out with Indiana Jones, hat and whip blazing, within the confines of the United States.Secondly, this is a badly written story. Raiders of the Lost Ark established a template for this kind of film by having one scene near the start of the movie that lays out all the necessary exposition and then the adventure kicks off from there. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has at least 3 separate exposition scenes, one of them coming in the middle of the movie. Almost all of the characters in the film are poorly written. Cate Blanchett's character is just cartoonishly evil. She has none of the depth and realism of Belloc from Raiders and she doesn't even function as a contrast to Indiana Jones, like the chief villains in The Last Crusade. She's really the equivalent of the pagan priest from Temple of Doom, except we didn't have to listen to that guy spout off a bunch of self-important dialog. John Hurt's character only real purpose in the film is to lug around the crystal skull and make a grand total of 3 comments about other dimensions at the end of the story. This movie also has the hallmark of all badly written filmscharacters who just stand around and watch special effects happening. The climax is one of the all-time worst ""stand there and watch the special effects"" moments in Hollywood history.Thirdly, this movie is derivative. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the origins of the modern adventure movie. In the years since it came out, there's been a plethora of knockoffs on the big screen and TV. But Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is like a knockoff of those knockoffs. Heck, the movie it most closely resembles isn't an Indiana Jones film but the history trivia-thon National Treasure. This is nothing but a by-the-numbers story without an original or different idea in its head. It's also another film that's been completely consumed by the CGI Borg that's conquered the world. Too many of the action scenes are so physically impossible, so obviously artificial, that there's never any real tension or excitement to them.The only really good thing is the return of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. But even with that, it's hard to know if it's really good or if you're just so happy to see her and Indy back together.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't as bad as the Star Wars prequels or Spider-Man 3, but it fits firmly within the category of summer blockbuster that sucks hard. Stephen Spielberg can do better than that. George Lucas should be able to be better than that. The public deserves better than that.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
103,MaxBorg89,He's back!,7,28 May 2008,"The world really misses Indiana Jones, hence the pitiful attempts to replace him with the likes of Dirk Pitt (Sahara), Robert Langdon (The Da Vinci Code) and Ben Gates (the National Treasure franchise). Predictably, none of them can match the original, and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull confirms what everyone was hoping for: Indy is back, and it was worth waiting 19 years (well, for the most part)!Sceptics might still be worried watching the opening sequence since, aside from the traditional credits (they look exactly like those used in the other three films), there isn't anything to suggest we're watching the right movie. But then we're dragged into the famous Hangar 51, and some Russian soldiers (as the film is set in 1957, Nazis were a bit out of the question) pull two men out of a car, guns immediately pointed at them. One of the two (Ray Winstone) raises his hands; the other picks up his hat, puts it on his head, and as John Williams' immortal theme music kicks in with an almost nostalgic feel we get the first real glimpse of the man himself: it is Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), that's for sure!The reason he has been dragged there is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), a ruthless KGB agent, is convinced he can help them acquire immense, supernatural power with which they could control the world. Naturally, he refuses and somehow manages to get out of there alive. Back home, he learns an old friend of his, Harold Oxley (John Hurt) has disappeared while looking for a crystal skull, an artifact of supposed alien origin that could give Spalko what she craves. Although he isn't that young anymore, Indy sets out to find the skull, finding unexpected help in the shape of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a greaser who happens to know Oxley, as well as another key person from Indiana's past.Rumor has it Ford and Steven Spielberg initially hesitated when George Lucas came up with the crystal skull idea, thinking the sci-fi element would be too much for this kind of film. No need to worry: anything alien-related is used sparingly, as is CGI, with most of the stunts and special effects being obtained with old-school methods, the Indiana Jones way, at least until the third act, which is a bit of a let-down. The script, written by Spielberg's Jurassic Park collaborator David Koepp, is largely terrific: ditching all kinds of pointless references to the previous films (except for a brief glimpse of the Ark of the Covenant in the very long prologue - nearly half an hour - and some information regarding the fate of Marcus Brody and Henry Jones Sr.), it remains faithful to the spirit of the series - fun, exciting and witty. If comparisons have to be made, Crystal Skull is closer in tone to Raiders of the Lost Ark than any other entry in the franchise (however, Raiders remains unsurpassed, that's a given), a fact that is acknowledged by the return of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, the first, and best, of the ""Indy girls"". It does also partly mirror Last Crusade in the continuous spats between Indiana and Mutt (another connection: ""mutt"" is a kind of dog, and as every true fan knows Indy was named after a dog too, both on-screen and off), which are amusing enough to make up for LaBoeuf's demographic-driven presence. Winstone, on the other hand, is no Sallah but works anyway, and as the first major thespian to play a villain in the franchise, Blanchett doesn't disappoint: she's cold, cruel and determined - a joy to watch.There is, of course, only one big question left at this point: is Ford still as good as he was twenty years ago? The answer is yes, yes and again yes - sure, he has aged, but that only adds to the character's lovable humanity. In fact, he is so instantly convincing it's almost hard to notice it's been 19 years since the third installment: he wears Indy's clothes as if they were a second skin, meaning a fifth film, assuming it is done the right way, wouldn't be that bad an idea.What's left to say? Oh yes, the dialogue that perfectly captures the spirit of the film: ""You're a... teacher?"" Mutt asks. ""Part-time"" Indy answers. That's Indiana Jones: part-time teacher, full-time hero and cinematic icon. And unlike his imitators, he will never, ever be out of fashion.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
104,Fluke_Skywalker,Numbskull is more like it,5,3 October 2014,"For some reason I pull out 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' every few years thinking that this time it won't be as bad as I remember. Unfortunately, it always is. There are a few decent moments in the first act--The opening bit with the 50s teens hot-roding around as Elvis plays, the motorcycle chase through campus--but it keeps getting progressively worse until you're watching it with a full body cringe. It's so bad that it almost feels like one of those god-awful parody movies directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.You really wanna exacerbate the experience of watching 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'?

I saw it in the cinema and it is the only film that left me feeling violated, as if I had watched something I shouldn't have, like a snuff film or some sort of heinously depraved sex act.I'm not going to go into detail with my reasoning because there are many reviews on this site that dissect the film in order to justify a 1 rating and they do it in a far more entertaining way than I would. Let's just say nothing in the movie worked for me and the only thing I took away from the cinema was my girlfriend's stunned silence.If it came from someone other than Spielberg and Lucas I wouldn't be so disappointed. The explanation they gave suggested that some viewers might have missed the point of it being a 50s B-Movie homage. Well, I think they missed the point that this theme has no place in the Indiana Jones franchise and neither does the cartoonishly over the top action and CG effects. These are two of the greatest movie innovators of the twentieth century, but with this sequel they let the fans down, let themselves down and they let the franchise down.There is a South Park episode called 'The China Probrem' that uses one character's experience of watching this movie as a device in its plot line and it says all you need to know.I will never watch it again as I am still (12 years on) trying to purge it from my memory.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
106,r96sk,"Worst of the series, though it isn't a million miles away from the preceding three",7,18 April 2020,"'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is certainly the worst of the series, though it isn't a million miles away from the preceding three in truth.In fact, for the majority I was having a decent time watching it. Harrison Ford, despite the years that have gone by since 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', still makes for a very fine Indy in the lead.Away from the main man, Shia LaBeouf is good as Mutt though two other fresh faces aren't all that. Cate Blanchett's character, Irina, is a welcomed one given she isn't a boring love interest, but overall I just wasn't feeling her role at all. Ray Winstone is annoying in this as Mac, he is simply there to oil the wheels of the plot.The premise is what lets this all down. I was with it across the first and second acts, but once it reaches the film's finale it drops in quality and entertainment drastically. Very poor conclusion.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
107,barnabyrudge,"Disappointing return for Indiana Jones after a 19 year hiatus - not especially bad, just not as good as we've come to expect.",5,19 June 2008,"There seems to be an unwritten law in the Indiana Jones series that the odd-numbered entries are excellent and the even-numbered entries are less so. While Raiders Of The Lost Ark (no.1) and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (no. 3) are fine movies, thoroughly entertaining and exhilarating, the magic doesn't really come across in Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (no. 2) and Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull (no.4). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is the least entertaining of all the Indy films  especially disappointing when one reflects that the makers had 19 years to come up with a suitable script to carry on the successful Indy legacy.In the 1950s, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick Mac (Ray Winstone) are captured by Russian spies and taken to the secret American air base Area 51. Here, a formidable lady agent with psychic prowess, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), forces them to help her locate a box containing an alien life-form. The hunt for the alien is successful, but just before the enemies prepare to kill him Indy manages to make an audacious escape. Later, when Indy is back in his home town, he is approached by a young biker rebel named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). Mutt has been ordered by his mother and an old college eccentric to ask for Indy's help in tracking down the tomb of a long lost conquistador who went missing searching for the fabled city of El Dorado. After various adventures they find the tomb, and discover that it contains a crystal skull shaped exactly like the alien head from Area 51. Soon after, the group of villainous Russians turn up and take Indy and Mutt prisoner, forcing them to assist in their hunt for the lost city of El Dorado (which, apparently, was built by extra terrestrials with extraordinary knowledge and psychic ability which the Russkies intend to exploit). Various jungle adventures ensue, during which Indy is reunited with his old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen)  Mutt's mother  and his eccentric archaeology colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt). Everything comes to a climax in the ruins of an Amazonian city, where the true nature of the legend of El Dorado and the secret of the crystal skull become clear..It's obvious just from the plot synopsis that Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is over-plotted, with too many disparate plot elements and characters thrown into the mix. It's an unusual twist for Indy to be searching for a scientific ""treasure"" (an alien skull and, later, a city built by extra-terrestrials)  this gives the film an air of originality over the three earlier instalments. But in every other department, this entry is inferior to its predecessors. There's no sense of wonder; the action sequences are mainly routine; Ford seems indifferent as Indy; the John Williams score is underused; even the special effects don't really live up to what we've come to expect in modern films. It's hard to believe that David Koepp's unwieldy script is really the culmination of so much prolonged effort and toil  it has an almost hurried feel to it, as if the film was written and made in a rush. Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull stands up as a passable action film in its own right  if it's your first brush with an Indy film you might even rather like it. But if you're a die-hard fan of the series the chances are you'll come away from this one feeling rather disappointed with the end product.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
108,MissSimonetta,Mediocre but it could have been much more terrible,6,17 January 2016,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is a disappointment, definitely lackluster as far as Indiana Jones movies go, but it is not nearly as incompetent as I had been led to believe. Is Harrison Ford too old for the role? Probably. Does the film play it safe and lack grit? Yes. But the film itself has its moments, like the motorcycle chase and the humorous Indy-Mutt relationship. Cate Blanchett is camp incarnate as the Communist villain.Of course, the whole alien angle is bizarre. I'm not sure if science fiction is much of a good fit for this series. Eh, it could have been way worse. Try reading the aborted script for Indiana Jones and the Saucer Men from Mars. Now that is horrible schlock.

109,davispittman,I thought it was fun,7,4 April 2016,"The 4th Indians jones film has a great divide. The one side HATES it, and the other thinks it's fun and enjoyable. I fall on the fun and enjoyable side. I think this movie is well shot, has great special effects, and good solid performances by the cast members. Cate Blanchett, oh my goodness, Blanchett is so good as the Russian villain! Some people criticized her for ""phoning in a performance"" or being too cartoony, I don't think that either of the accusations are true, I think she gives a noble, well put together performance as the antagonist. And of course Harrison ford is back as Indiana himself, and he can still handle himself well, especially in high octane action sequences. And ya know lots of people were upset by seeing Shia Lebough cast, I apologize if I misspelled his last name. I thought he was good in the film, he showed off his acting chops, he can be funny, dramatic, and he handles himself well in moments of action in this movie. The plot has been accused of being silly and weird and unbelievable, but I mean all the Indiana jones movie plots are something that probably would not happen ever, so it's not all that strange. I liked the plot and thought it was very cool and certainly entertaining. The visuals are good and enjoyable. It's great to see Karen Allen here too, a very nostalgic and cool feeling is brought to the movie, she is a good asset to have. Overall, yes, I did have a good fun time with Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull, and I am not ashamed of it, I think it's well made. It even got a 78% approval rating on rotten tomatoes, so critics can't think too terribly of it. 7/10.

Which 'Mac' works for a ruthless Russian Colonel/Doctor Irina Spalko (Oscar-Winner:Cate Blanchett), which she forces Indiana to find the legendary ""Crystal Skill"".

Which it's been nineteen years since we haven't seen Ford playing the character role since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". Ford is one of the main reasons to see the movie, which he looks like he's having a great time in the picture. Since Ford's previous films hasn't been good lately. It's also cool for Spielberg directed the fourth movie in the series (Which he made every one, of course) and some of the crew from the previous movies who worked in the previous one including cast member Allen, who was introduced in ""Raiders in the Lost Art"". It seems everyone is having an great one in the cast, especially Blanchett playing the main villain and LaBoeuf has his moments in the movie.The premise is good, it doesn't take itself seriously and also the setting of the picture is a welcome change. Since the previous three were set in the 1930's. But like in the previous ""Indiana Jones"" movies, this one shares some of the same flaws. ""The Kindgom of the Crystal Skull"" does slows down during the mid-section of the movie and a bit heavy handed. But who cares, if the ""Indiana Jones"" series are heavy handed at times, they all were. Spielberg's and the energy of the cast makes up for most of the flaws. Watch for the clever references of the previous films and a couple of good in-jokes in the movie. The fourth film has the right amount of CGI as well, which i was glad. Especially these days, CGI in picture. When it's too much special effects, it does take over the movie.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. This DVD is digitally mastered for THX in Picture Quality and Superior Sound. DVD also includes two featurettes. There's an two-disc set available for DVD and Blu-ray with more special features.Is this my favorite of the series ? Nope, but it's still fun. Especially it's the first time i got to see ""Indiana Jones"" film in the big screen. Like January's release of ""Rambo"". Which it's completely different film-making. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is my third favorite of the series. The dark prequel ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is my favorite of the series. We all have different opinion, who of who's favorite movies of the series. Why debate about it, right? If you never seen the previous pictures at the big screen, this is your choice. If you do love the series and curious how Harrison Ford re-creates his character title role, see it now. Screenplay by David Koepp (Secret Window, Stir of Echoes, The Trigger Effect).

111,3xHCCH,Great Indy Fun... With Some Quibbles...,6,22 May 2008,"************SPOILER ALERT We were really very excited to watch this movie, the 4th installment of the revered Indiana Jones franchise, 19 years after I.J and the Last Crusade. It is the first day of showing here and we caught it right away.It is everything it was. The action, the thrills, the humor, they were all there. Of course, the great theme music was there. As well as the great action photography and editing. That exciting car chase in the jungle with the crystal skull changing hands was very well shot. Although the attack of the giant fire ants seems to derive from ""The Mummy"", I liked the way it was executed. It also brought back eerie terrifying childhood memories of ""The Helstrom Chronicle."" Harrison Ford is obviously much older, yet his charisma as Indiana Jones is quite intact. I did not actually like the news that he will have a sidekick in the person of Shia LaBeouf, but it was actually OK. I would like to watch the scene where they first meet again though. I did not get it at all why they met, which of course was how the whole adventure with crystal skull began.Now my problems with it. First, it is so faithful to the series, that it actually felt like you have seen it all before. I think the main problem of the whole movie is the story. I found the whole angle involving aliens to be preposterous. It just gives the whole film a rather thick layer of cheese. In addition to that, old Indy was quite the superman in this film. Too unbelievable even for a movie where we are asked to suspend our disbelief. I can accept all those narrow escapes in the jungle and the pyramids, as these have been seen before in the previous films. However, surviving a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator is stretching reality too much. It was a lame attempt to be funny in my opinion.These quibbles aside however it was still a very entertaining film. Not a waste of time at all. They better do better on the next film, especially if there will be a transferring of the hat (as suggested in the final scene). I do not want this film to end up as ""the Phantom Menace"" was for the ""Star Wars"" franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
112,JoeKarlosi,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) **,5,22 May 2008,"I'm not a big fan of Indiana Jones, per se... but I do think the first RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a great action film. Saw it in the theater when it was brand new, and then continued to watch the decline in quality as I sat through TEMPLE OF DOOM (2) and THE LAST CRUSADE (3). Well, now we have #4. I guess that since Sylvester Sallone scored successfully with returning an aged Italian Stallion to the screen for ROCKY BALBOA, and then struck even purer gold with his latest RAMBO revival, it was now Harrison Ford's turn to revamp his old swashbuckling hero. Actually, Ford does succeed in making Indie believable enough as an older man, but that's about where it ended for me.KINGDOM is not a ""bad"" film, but it's only ""Average"" at best; unremarkable, far-fetched, and the script is all over the place. The first half is rather lightweight stuff, set in 1957 and starting out almost like an episode of ""Happy Days"" with Jones gaining a young Fonzie-like partner who wants to help in locating the Crystal Skull of the title. Their first adventures together are very ho-hummish before getting into the second half where the action and fake-looking CGI effects overwhelm things to the point of becoming too much, too boring, and just not interesting. It's never a good sign when I can't wait for a movie to be over so I may get out of the theater and get back to my life. More than a few times I had to shake my head at how far credibility was strained, even for an Indiana Jones fantasy adventure ... I mean, do any of these characters ever receive a tiny scratch from some of the devastating situations they're faced with? And then to add insult to injury, the explanation for the origin of the Crystal Skull is just way out of place for an Indiana Jones movie. The ending wraps things up nicely for what it's worth, by that point. ** out of ****",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
113,drystyx,Why it will be well remembered in the future,7,23 April 2013,"Not only have there been three big budget films on Indiana Jones, but there have been TV series, spin offs, and imitations.So, when a retired icon version of Indiana Jones makes another film, it would seem to be dead in the water.However, this film worked. It worked in a way that it will be well regarded by future audiences.One chief reason is the return of the original heroine, including the same actress. Both of them a bit on in years, but still attractive and likable, the same acting pair, the same character pair.It truly makes the story.What if someone watches it, and never saw the Raiders film? Wouldn't matter. This film is still heavy handed cartoon comedy adventure. One thing about being over the top, this much over the top, is that it can't be taken seriously any way. It's like watching James Bond fall out of an airplane onto many parachutes, and ultimately onto a car, and walk away.Many such scenes here.The characters make it enjoyable. The villainess is a mixture of the usual modern evil and old time three dimensional character. She has a method to her madness. That also adds to the spice of the film.All in all, it looks like everyone had a good time. Much like an old Dan Duryea Western.And the good time spreads cheer to the audience.All this has a good effect of watchabliity, even to those unfamiliar with the Indiana Jones icon.Those who are familiar, as he figures to be as much a standard as Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes in the future, or the suave James Bond, or the power trio of the starship Enterprise, will certainly love the mature version of the lovable characters, and the new young-ling being brought into future stories.The heroine, Marion, is so captivating, one thinks of her as still a young girl. There is an atmosphere to the characters as well as the vision here.This film works. It will be well regarded in future generations, maybe more so than even I expect.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
114,EUyeshima,"A Wizened Indy Comes Back to Form in a Rollicking, Overcrowded Adventure",7,26 May 2008,"Truth be told, the latest Indiana Jones installment, nineteen years after the last, is fine, rollicking popcorn entertainment and not nearly the major disappointment some critics would lead you to believe. It may not compete with ""Iron Man"" in terms of story freshness or ""Spider Man 3"" for state-of-the-art CGI effects, but I never felt producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg had much more on their combined minds than updating the outrageous derring-do of the Saturday afternoon matinée serials of the 1930's and 40's. With the predominant use of traditional stunt work and pyrotechnics, the 2008 film represents old-fashioned escapism at its purest and falters only when the convoluted plot gets in the way, which is quite often, especially in the exposition-heavy first half. Fortunately, the veteran hands keep the high-spirited adventure afloat over its 123-minute running time, even though it never quite achieves the breathlessly excitement of the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", an inevitable fate for all the sequels.Written by David Koepp (""Jurassic Park"", ""Death Becomes Her""), the overcrowded story is set at the height of the Cold War in 1957, as the aging Jones finds himself captured by a group of Russian soldiers in legendary Area 51 out in the Nevada desert. Headed by Colonel Irina Spalko, a severely mannered doctor with psychic abilities, they force him to find a crate with the remains of an extraterrestrial inside (shades of ""E.T.""). This leads to a terrifically energetic warehouse fight sequence that quickly reassures us that the filmmakers have not forgotten what the chief lure of the series is. Jones next manages to escape a nuclear test blast through creative means, at which point the movie calms down with the professor back at Marshall College. Forced to leave the university due to an FBI investigation, Jones meets a young motorcycle greaser named ""Mutt"" Williams, who tells him that his old colleague Harold Oxley is lost in the Peruvian jungle looking for the mysterious crystal skull.Once in Peru in the film's last hour, the action brings all the characters together, including Spalko and her soldiers, on a maddening chase for not only the skull but the secret temple from which it came. In the middle of the morass is Jones' old love and Mutt's mother, the still-feisty Marion Ravenwood. There's a wildly enjoyable chase scene on the edge of a steep cliff that has everything thrown in - a rapid-fire machine gun on a turret, fanciful swordplay, wine-swinging, aggressive howler monkeys, and an army of man-eating red ants. The last scenes bring the science fiction aspect into focus with Spielberg in familiar territory, and I have to admit that a lot of the climactic excitement is undercut by too many characters that are relatively incidental to the action at hand. Throughout the film, you'll see winking tributes to Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" and Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".At 65, Harrison Ford wears his age well, meeting the physical demands of the role head-on, and what comes across is a smart actor who innately understands the mythic qualities of his character while having fun with the outlandish situations he faces in quick succession. It's great to see Karen Allen, still with her wide, infectious smile, come back as Marion, but other than a few toss-off lines and her character's gutsy driving skills, she is given little to do this time. An actress as vibrant as Allen should be used for more than nostalgic purposes. As Spalko with her harsh Louise Brooks-style bob and using a bit of the Dietrich accent she used in ""The Good German"", Cate Blanchett is obviously having a good time playing a military dominatrix with equal parts Garbo in ""Ninotchka"" and Natasha Fatale, Boris' taller half. My only complaint is that the filmmakers don't make Spalko evil enough to be truly as menacing as Blanchett could be.As the obvious successor to the series, Shia LeBeouf plays the cocksure ""Mutt"" as a young Brando wannabe (circa ""The Wild One""), but he lacks the genuine swagger and dangerous edge to make the character more than a plot device to attract younger viewers. Ray Winstone as the loyalty-shifting Mac, John Hurt as Oxley, and Jim Broadbent as Jones' fellow academic all play their smaller roles with their usual élan, although I wish each one was given more opportunity to shine here. On the upside, John Williams' heroic music score is intact, and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński does a nice job succeeding Douglas Slocombe in picking up on the look of the previous films. The movie is just a little too busy to be a complete home run for the series, but it should satisfy long-time fans who have clamored for Indy's return. Judged from that perspective, it succeeds.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
115,TOMNEL,A welcomed treat.,9,23 May 2008,"It's been 19 years since the last Indiana Jones and because of the huge wait, fans got more bitter as the years went on. Now, that it's been so long, and this film comes out, many people have the opinion that this better be the ultimate Indiana Jones movie, and it deliver twice what Raiders did. Honestly, it does not come anywhere near Raiders in content, though the action scenes can be pretty fun to watch. Some plot elements are a little goofy, and they all reek of George Lucas, but it makes up for any of it's shortcomings with the pure entertainment it delivers.The year is 1957, and Indiana Jones is needed to help the Soviets find a mysterious crystal skull. After escaping from them, and several other strange occurrences, Indiana meets a young man named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeuf) who needs Indy to help him save his mother. Not to give any plot elements away, Indiana helps him, and they end up in the Peruvian jungles avoiding the Soviets, killer ants, and natives. Indiana meets back up with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) in Peru, and several more crazy happenings go on.This film was not disappointing to me, but I can see how some die hard fans can see it this way. This was not the best of the Indy films. In fact, for me, I'd rate this third, only above Temple of Doom. However, with that said, Temple of Doom was a fantastic action flick, and so was this. The action scenes were the crowd pleaser's, and as true with the last three films, they were well filmed and campy, but great fun. The performances are all good, including Shia Labeuf, who I honestly thought I'd hate in this. He works, sort of, as a comic relief, but he ends up just setting up most of the jokes, or action scenes for Indiana, only stealing one action scene which was done well no matter which actor has the floor for it. The plot was a little more far-fetched than the last three films, but, these films are set in an alternate adventurous reality, and in that reality where the Jones films exist, this isn't too out there.Overall, fans expecting a new Raiders will be disappointed, but fans expecting another great installment to the Indiana Jones series will enjoy this like I did.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 121 mins. PG-13 for violence.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
116,aharmas,"If not the best of the series, awfully close",10,23 May 2008,"Steven Spielberg did change the way we appreciate cinema with his technical and storytelling abilities. He turns a vision into a reality, giving us entertainment that reaches beyond amusement and touches our hearts and souls. He has never pretended to be a genius, though by now, it's a title that fits him very well. As everyone knows, he has touched upon almost every genre and given us long hours of entertainment. ""Indiana"" will always be associated with George Lucas, but it's Spielberg's ability to transcend the written page to a very dynamic execution that results in films we care about, and the latest entry in the ""Indiana"" series is a winner.""Skull"" delivers in more ways than expected, and I'm so glad that its previews were limited and sort of a throwback to what Hollywood did before: making a good film and giving us a teaser, something that hinted at the quality of a film, without blowing entire budgets in giving us an illusion that there was more substance to a half-baked idea. For a long time, we have lived with disappointments when the film that we get to see has no heart, no life, and most importantly no brain. ""Skull"" doesn't suffer from such tragic mishaps. In fact, it's got a strong, healthy heart, an appreciation for our intelligence, an eye for fantasies and dreams, and the quick pace that made ""Raiders"" one of our all-time favourite movies.In fact, ""Skull"" pays tribute to all the entries in the series, and it works very well blending nostalgia with its present adventure. Indy knows he is not a young buck anymore. He clears this from its opening scenes, when he admits that it's not as easy anymore. Later on, he is confronted with the passage of time and the realization that he might have lost a golden opportunity along the way, and that there is very little time to regret it. He is still a gambler, but he plays a bit more safely now.The film introduces a new villain, the amazing Cate Blanchett taking on a role that is departure from her heavy dramatic roles, but that it is nonetheless executed with her flawless approach. It is the type of villain that we would love to see over and over, and the question is whether Spielberg can somehow make this possible. The question is answered in the last act of the movie. She plays her character with much gusto and a lot of fun. Her role is physical, intelligent, and is sort of a mirror image of Indy himself, as she looks for more than the obvious. Her quest is similar, but her motive might be a bit darker.""Skull"" takes Indiana from New Mexico to Connecticut to the Amazonian Jungle, and its pace is relentless, as if Spielberg was somehow trying to make up for lost time. It is still a thrilling ride, as Indiana has to resort to all kinds of tricks to escape from the bad guys and insure his survival. We know he will succeed, and the tone remains light as in the other movies. No LOTR tragic surprises occur, but the escapes remain as inventive and fun as they were in the first film. As a matter of fact, pay attention or you might miss the tributes to the previous three films, as Indiana makes his way to the new mystery he must unravel.This film has more heart than any of the other three, and it is to Spielberg's credit that he reunites Karen Allen and Harrison Ford and takes full advantage of their chemistry to restart their 20+ years old affair. Marion remains as spunky and determined as ever, and Indiana still very attracted to her. To complete the picture, we have a young man in the picture, and he is quite capable of holding his own against Ford. In fact, they have much in common, as we learn later on, as both of them join forces to find the mystical ""skull"" of the title.Joining them in the ride is the fantastic John Hurt, a man who has proved very resourceful at playing ""damaged"" characters. He does that quite well in this film, yet he does manage to have fun with it, as he switches from one universe to another, and this might sound a bit confusing, but it is actually well realized in the film.Much praise should be given to the expert hand of Michael Khan, the incredibly beautiful camera work, which hopefully won't be ignored at awards time, and the clever script that manages to fuse the best of the previous films with the new story. ""Indy"" made us wait too long for his return. At the end of the film, there is a hint that he is ready to move on to a different world, yet, as he said to Mutt in one of the scenes, he is only a professor (teacher) only part time. Indy knows what makes his heart beat; his honesty is what makes his character likable and a classic. Harrison Ford sinks his teeth back into the role with a delight that he hasn't shown in years. He gave much of its soul to ""Star Wars"", and his talent turned Indy into a treasure. I am almost certain that I'm voicing the gratitude of many as I express thanks to Spielberg for keeping this series alive and making a great comeback a reality.The word treasure has a special meaning in the picture, as Indy's adventures have always been metaphors for more than the search for special objects. It's what we know and how we use that knowledge that gives special power over our situation. Knowledge takes Indy into exotic worlds and saves his behind most of the time. His very human, and now much older character has grown much older, much wiser, and definitely a lot more fun. Enjoy this treat!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
117,Enchorde,Another Indy adventure,8,14 March 2009,"Recap: The years have passed by and Indy has gotten older. But he has not lost his ways. And when he gets caught up in a Soviet attempt to find a mythical weapon hidden deep in the Amazonian jungle, he don't take long to don the hat and the whip. As many times before it becomes a race to find the clues and artifacts first, before the enemies does. From the States the adventure goes to Peru and then further into the jungle. Along for the ride is a young boy, who is the son of Marian, the girl that Indy met in Raiders of the lost Ark.Comments: A typical Indy-adventure. For sure it is hard to match the movies that came before this, as they almost has reached legendary status, especially among its fans. Especially when it is done after so many years since the last before it.Intentionally it has many similarities with the moves before it, but it also differs on some points. The basis is the same though. A spectacular adventure that takes us around the world (and the classical red lines on the maps as Indy travels). Myths that become real and mystical artifacts that works beyond comprehension. And of course Indy wielding his whip, saving his hat and always doing it with humor.How does it fare among the other films then? In my opinion quite good. I think it handled the mix of humor and adventure very well. And to be expected the special effects is better, but still with the Indiana Jones feeling. Perhaps the story is a little thin on some parts, in some parts due to that to flesh out everything that is put into the movie would have made the movie far too long. Still it is noticeable sometimes. The sub-stories could have been developed more. But the main thing, the adventure, is there in full force.I like the Indy movies because of the adventure, the sense of exploration and the sense of awe. The mixing of religion, myth and history into what could have been reality. This fourth installment got them all. Maybe they go a little too far with the final scene... but I liked it.8/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
118,Jonny_Numb,"The ""Saw IV"" of Indiana Jones Films",4,8 June 2008,"SPOILERS: Aliens. Why did it have to be aliens? Coming nearly 20 years after foiling the plight of Nazis seeking to steal the Holy Grail in ""The Last Crusade,"" the epic franchise begun with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has gone the route of the utterly ridiculous in ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" an attempt to draw attention (and return relevance) to an iconic character who has been long-absent from cinema screens.But seriously...space aliens? The enduring elements of the ""Indiana Jones"" series, in addition to the appeal of Harrison Ford's portrayal of the unflappable archaeologist, is the pulp feel of the stories given an added significance thanks to performances that can fluctuate between the lightheartedness of a romantic comedy and the peril of serious drama with uncanny precision (observe the exchanges between Ford and Karen Allen in ""Raiders""), top-notch visual design and special effects, and plots that, no matter how outlandish, remain grounded in reality due to the believability and pathos of the characters.And this is the crux of ""Crystal Skull""'s problems: screenwriter David Koepp, who has scripted several Steven Spielberg-directed megabucks blockbusters (""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel, ""The Lost World""; ""War of the Worlds"") with varying degrees of success, is much better when left to direct his own scripts (see ""Secret Window""); when given a weighty proposition to write something on a more epic scale (and for a wider audience), characterization often gets compromised in the name of spectacle. In ""Crystal Skull,"" the sky's the limit when it comes to suspension of disbelief, and much of the film feels like a blatantand at times desperateattempt to recapture the pulp roots of the initial trilogy; but lacking the synthesis between character and event, the film merely spirals off into the incredible. The result, for my tastes, is pretty far from exciting.So, anyway: Aliens. With big heads and empty black eyes. And some kind of inter-dimensional portal thingy.The plot this time out has the sixtysomething Dr. Jones (played by Ford's haggard performance) running afoul of a gang of cartoonishly overwrought Reds (led by rapier-wielding cliché Cate Blanchett), seeking the mythic, extraterrestrial skull of the title to brainwash the West into communist automatons. Along the way, there are respects paid to now-deceased characters from the previous films, a rekindled love affair between Jones and the long-estranged Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, reprising her ""Raiders"" role), and an unlikely (and ultimately less than compelling) partnership with a young greaser by the name of Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf), who could possibly be our hero's son. Meanwhile, renowned actors like Ray Winstone (""The Departed""), John Hurt (""The Proposition""), and Jim Broadbent (""Art School Confidential"") are left adrift in roles that are either limited, wasted, or sketchy to the point of confusion.While I would argue that Spielberg, whose films almost always veer toward the overwrought and melodramatic, is craftier and more passionate when dealing with personal subjects, it is hard to deny that the ""Indiana Jones"" series is as personal as serious works like ""Schindler's List"" or ""Munich"" simply because of his long-standing commitment to it. But, as with most of his recent high-budget productions, ""Crystal Skull"" feels curiously detachedthe ""reunion"" scenes between Jones and Marion don't carry the comic timing or satisfaction they should, and the introduction of Mutt and a slew of other characters seems inspired out of a desperation to attach a more satisfying ""legacy"" to Indiana Jones (when, really, the image of our heroes riding into the sunset at the end of ""The Last Crusade"" more than did the job). The action scenes are played mostly for broad comedy and are edited to the point of confusion, and the pace-deadening exposition scenes expect the audience to keep track of far too many names, places, events, and chronologies, thus taking the fun out of the adventure as a whole.For a character whose name has become as legendary as the items he seeks, ""Crystal Skull"" hardly does Indiana Jones any justice. It's the most futileand least necessaryinstallment in an otherwise stellar series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
119,ShootingShark,"Sensationally Old-Fashioned Action Extravaganza Full Of Fun, Spectacle And Adventure",7,1 June 2008,"In 1957, unorthodox archaeologist Indiana Jones learns that an old colleague, Professor Oxley, has gone missing while searching for a legendary crystal skull in Peru. Teaming up with some new and old friends, he goes in quest of the man and the myth, but there are untold dangers ahead, as well as a troop of implacable Russian spies on his tail After twenty years, Indiana Jones returns to the big screen in this lavish, exciting, spectacular and funny action blockbuster. Okay, so Ford may be ageing (he was sixty-five) but he's still the wonderful vagabond hero he was in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, he's just slowed down a little. This movie is very much in the spirit of that original film  pure escapist nonsense of the most entertaining kind. We get a mad Russian Ninotchka type, a sneaky British double-agent, a punk motorcycle kid with a big secret, the search for El Dorado, a cabal involving an alien hive-mind, Indy getting caught in an A-bomb test, battles in crypts, a car chase through a university campus, an epic fight aboard trucks racing through the jungle, an attack by swarms of killer ants, all topped off with an eye-popping catastrophic flying-saucer finale. Writers David Koepp, George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson have sensibly gone back to the Old School of Adventure Stories, chucked all sorts of ripping stuff together and smoothed it out into a gripping adventure. Spielberg has lost none of his directorial flair, and helms a brilliantly visual comic-book action flick, filled with breathtaking chases and nonchalant little tricks, as well as some crafty nods to the previous movies. The cast all have a ball with their larger-than-life roles, with honours going to both Blanchett as the piercing, stiff-backed KGB Colonel Spalko, complete with a Louise Brooks bob and a collection of rapiers, and the wonderful return of Allen as the sparky Marion Ravenwood, dishing out one-liners and romantic smiles with boundless energy; one of the funniest moments is where she drives an aquatic truck straight off a cliff. Guy Dyas' sets and Pablo Helman's visual effects combine to produce wonderful environments in which the stories take place; the Mayan tomb at the end is simply sensational, and as always, John Williams' buoyant music charges the whole thing forward. Inevitably, I can't help but compare this movie with its eighties predecessors, and for my money it's a touch more pedestrian; just not quite so much fun, not so mythic, but I have no doubt it will grow in stature. It's what it is; a great big action-packed, funny, scary adventure movie designed to entertain, which it does with style to spare, something all movies should aspire to. Produced by the old Lucas-Spielberg-Kennedy-Marshall team, this is a terrific reunion with one of cinema's most enduring heroes.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I believe that if it had been released just 2/3 years after 'Last Crusade' nobody would have complained at all. After all it is so in keeping with the first three and references them all very cleverly. What do these people want? CGI explosions? A computer generated Indy? HD filming? I've heard people moan that there is an alien involvement (Inter-dimensional beings in point of fact) . Yeah because the Holy Grail, Ark Of The Covenant and Glowing Stones that make you think someone is stealing your heart are all believable!?? Doesn't sound scientifically provable to me.This film keeps to the tradition of those that have gone before it. Harrison still keeps up with the stunts, the wit and the character, supported by a great cast and an interesting concept. It's definitely better than 'Temple Of Doom' and actually has more in common with the other two than 'Doom' does, purely in the way that it is filmed and produced.I really hope they can make the fifth instalment as planned for 2022, it's just a shame that Shia LeBeouf won't be in it after the stupid things he said following this ones release.

I also have liked Nyoka, Jungle Jim, Flash Gordon and Mighty Mouse since very young ... especially Nyoka.Indestructible Indiana Jones played by craggy Harrison Ford returns to manic action after a nineteen year absence, this time tracking down an ancient crystal skull of the gods and lamely deciding to return it to its rightful ancient abode when got. This time he has a son in tow to keep the younger viewers on board and cgi cartoonery to contend with, and this is the main problem: as a ten year old I would've loved every second and accepted everything in it without question. Now many moons have passed I find this pretty laughable, the cartoonery is preposterous and an insult to the intelligence of most viewers – blithely going over three massive waterfalls, with trillions of starving fast ants, millions of boulders circling in the air inches away from Indy's apparently unbreakable cranium, car and motorbike galore chases which defy the laws of physics, stuck inside a flying bouncing fridge in a holocaust – the list goes on and on! And yet, if I were ten, or this was Nyoka...There's much action and chaos but little plot and point. It's a roller-coaster ride and it's difficult to get off such rides before the end, you have to see how all the chaos is resolved and who lives or dies. I've seen this hokum with mixed pleasure a couple of times now with common sense switched off, as is also usually required when watching cliffhanger serials from the '30's and '40's.

122,onepotato2,Temple of Dumb,3,29 May 2008,"or, Indiana Jones and the Half-hearted EffortThe characters in this movie talk and talk and talk. Maybe an hour into it, we're finally out of the States, in the complex grave of a conquistador... where, IN THE GRAVE, the characters again bring the movie to a dead stop, to talk for another ten minutes. Is it a metaphor? The grave is a perfect place to leave this films weak energy level.The script is structurally poor. It seems like it's composed of unrelated lesser scenes from the other movies. This movie has no pacing, whatsoever. It never develops a rhythm. It never reaches any level of intensity. The big climax arrived (after fits and starts), and my reaction was ""Oh, I was supposed to care about that?... uhhh... oh that's what happens when you put the thirteenth skull of a dead alien crew back in place... something not very interesting happens. ...I guess that's an ending.""Well yeah, of course the damned thing needed to come to life, because there's nothing else exciting in the damned movie, but that's all you have it do? Despite the work of a CGI team, the movie never achieves any inspired, large-scale moment. Another problem is that the film waits eons to advance a lackluster Chariots of the Gods/Stargate/2001 theory; that aliens affected human civilization. The movie is at least the 4th to venture into this territory - It's not exactly fresh material. Harrison Ford could look ten years younger if he stood up straight and stopped walking around like he just crapped his adult diapers. Bogging things down further, the movie has no sexual tension.For the final tease to work (LaBouef almost tries on Indy's hat) the movie has to have reached some of the heights of the previous ones, which would make us consider watching another set of Indy movies.

Believe it or not, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is the first IJ movie that I've seen at the theater. They were not released in the former USSR (that's probably why, Spielberg and Lucas made their bad guys Russians this time :)) and I saw the trilogy first in the end of the 1980s when the videotapes became available. The new movie is full of adventures, has not one but three fallings down of waterfalls and the huge attacking red ants. As in all Indy movies, there is a long and spectacular signature chase sequence, this time a multi-vehicle chase through the jungle with the heroes jumping on the full speed from one car to another, two characters engaged in the sword fight standing on the parallel moving jeeps, the Crystal Scull of the title falling back and forth from the good guys to the bad ones. The ""baddest guy"" here is the girl played by Cate Blanchette wearing the uniform not unlike Dr. Evil's and the black wig a-la Louise Brooks of ""Pandora's Box"" or Uma Thurman of ""Pulp Fiction"". She plays a Russian villainess, Dr. Irina Spalko, the lead researcher of psychic phenomenon and the supernatural. Blanchette is as good as ever proving that she can play successfully any role, including the one that requires a lot of physical actions. The fourth movie takes place in the different time than the first three, and it is set against the realities of the 50s: the beginning of cold war, the double agents, the talks about UFOs and aliens. One of the scenes, as remarkable as it is memorable, depicts a ground-level nuclear test in Nevada on the picturesque town that was built only to be destroyed after the drop of atomic bomb.The movie is beautiful - no surprise here, Janusz Kaminski, usual Spielberg's ""partner in crime"" was DOP for it. I just realized that it was the first Indiana Jones movie for Kaminski - the first three were shot by Douglas Slocombe. I liked the story and the acting by Ford. At 65, he is perhaps one of very few actors who could bring back to life beloved character and the years would not have power over him. I like a lot John Hurt as Professor 'Ox' Oxley - equally comical and moving as the scientist who was able to talk to the mysterious Crystal Skull and who kept the keys to its secrets. I am always glad to see Ray Winstone and Jim Broadbent on the screen.

I mean, if anyone remembers the first Indy movie he hitches a ride on the OUTSIDE of a submarine and arrives safely and barely wet inside a Nazi U-Boat facility. Somehow we buy into it b/c it's Indiana Jones. He was a flawed HUMAN. But somewhere along the way in Indy IV they decided that wasn't enough. The jungle chase and waterfall sequence aren't compelling b/c it feels like we're watching a video game. And then there is the casting. Sharia Laboof has about as much charisma as strawberry jello. And I just do not get Cate Blanchett on any level - she's got the horse-face looks of Katherine Hepburn and the annoying- accent tic of Meryl Streep. John Hurt embarrasses himself.

While people forget that aspects of the first 3 artifacts are real, the crystal skulls are a real thing that is actively being investigated. Because it's caught up in all the ""alien conspiracy"" communities I think the movie absorbed some of the ridicule of those people.The story itself is well structured, Cate Blanchett and Karen Allen are welcome are awesome additions to the story, and despite the ""sci-fi"" element from an alien skull, the movie keeps to a archaeological theme by investigating an ancient temple site.While I'm not going to re-watch this, please ignore the negative hype and give this a try if you like a good action adventure story.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
126,Rob_Taylor,Indiana Jones and the Weak Script of Mediocrity,7,19 June 2008,"This is a surprisingly difficult review to write, given that the Indy franchise was always one of my favourites. However much I looked forward to this film, the shadow of doubt always crept over me that it would not live up to either my expectations, or the hype. And of course it did not.That said, it was not as bad as early rumour (and reviews) made it out to be. Having steeled myself for a big let-down, I was relieved to find it to be a reasonable, but uninspired adventure romp.Harrison Ford is still Indy and they at least had the grace to let the character age gracefully, rather than have a stunt double performing excessively ridiculous stunts. But he comes across as a pale shadow of his former self, often reduced to telling others (mostly Shia La Beouf) what to do, instead of doing them himself.Shia La Beouf, by the way, gives a solid performance that won't do him any harm here and, in fact, mostly out acts everyone else on screen which, considering you have the likes of Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone and John Hurt involved is no mean feat.To be fair to the others though, they often have little to do. Ray Winstone's character, for example, could have been acted by anybody else without loss to the movie. Likewise, Cate Blanchett was saddled with the most ridiculous over-the-top Russian accent imaginable and John Hurt spent most of his screen time pretending to be a mumbling lunatic.Some scenes (as it appears is the fashion these days) are included solely for the purpose of CGI-wow! factor. Indy surviving a nuclear blast inside a fridge and the godawful waterfall plummet, among them. The latter also does much to insult your intelligence, since the vehicle the party go over the falls in (no less than three times!) appears completely impervious to damage the first two drops and is then written off on the third drop. Likewise its occupants are also unscathed.All in all, the movie is a little over-indulgent and in places has a padded out feel to it. At no point was I ever really ""grabbed"" by the movie. It was all more of the same we have already seen in the previous Indy movies, but of a lesser stature than anything from those earlier works.In short then, an Indy movie highly derivative of previous efforts and lacking the punch to make it stand out on its own. Easily the weakest of all the quartet.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
127,eric262003,A Great One Last Effort For Dr. Jones and Company,8,27 April 2009,"Years ago as a child, I never had the chance to see the earlier ""Indiana Jones"" movies (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Temple of Doom""). And when Dr. Jones bid his fair adieu in ""The Last Crusade"", I was only a boy of twelve and I don't remember much. And now as Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) embarks on his last adventure in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", let's just say,it was a wild ride for him and maybe now he can finally rest. It's great to see the trio of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford collaborate again one more time in another thrill-seeking adventure of a lifetime. It's not as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it really has no intention of to begin with. Mostly due to the advanced updated visual effects, but the storytelling methods is still told in the tradtional way Indiana Jones is told since the first installment, the locations are old-school and the puzzles and narrow escapes Indy encounters still lingers on like it did since ""Raiders"" debuted in 1981.The opening scenes features Dr. Jones, being held hostage in a cave by the evil Soviets. They found something that Indy found a decade ago, an artifact that will grant them world domination. But the adventurous archaeologist won't just lie there and let them dominate as he shifts off into another dangerous mission and once again putting his life on the line even escaping from a bomb explosion is worth your money. But the adventure doesn't really start there (that's just a warm-up), a young man named Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) tells Dr. Jones, that an old colleague of his is held captive in South America by a group of civilians who are in pursuit to find the city of gold. Watch as Dr. Jones climbs aboard motorcycles, solving puzzles, exploring ancient Mayan caverns, and avoiding all adversaries including the crow-haired Russian villainess Irina, and critter like man-eating ants, among others. The adventures never get old in fact they get better through time. My main hiccup in this film is that there's no complexity to the story. It's not a big deal really, and just like ""National Treasure"", this movie will most likely keep you entertained rather than knowledged-enhanced. Even if someone spoils the puzzles for you, you'll be able to unravel secrets long before Dr. Jones does. Spielberg does a terrific job in keeping the flow of the story simplistic.The main ingedient to this film's success is the fun it has provided for us to obeserve. Ford has aged gracefully and even at 65 he shows no signs of slowing down. But Cate Blanchett as Irina, the Russian madwoman sporting a campy Russian accent is the most entertaining Indiana villain to date. Shia LeBeouf and Karen Allen also turn in some compelling performances. But hats off goes to the trio behind the cameras. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and composer John Williams for their eforts in creating another whip-lashing adventure for the younger audience to enjoy. It was a wild ride and Dr. Jones all that you achieved. There's only one thing left for me to say: Thank you. You touched our lives in the 1980's you came back today and your track record remains untouched. I will always praise you Dr. Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
128,Matt_Layden,Crystal Skull Suffers From The Star Wars Syndrome.,6,27 May 2008,"When Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade came to theaters in 1989 I was only 2 years old and had never seen Indiana Jones up on the big screen. In fact, as a kid my favourite one out of the three was Temple of Doom. As I grew older and appreciated the art of film-making more, I found myself leaning more towards Raiders of the Lost Ark, with Last Crusade in a close second. Flash forward to 2008 and Indiana Jones is back, only much older. I re-watched the original three, as I'm sure almost everyone did, to get myself in the mood for the old whip slinger. The main problem with Crystal Skull is it had to please fans after 19 years of build up. So it was bound to fail (in one way or another). In that light, it suffers from the ""Star Wars Syndrome."" Upon watching Crystal Skull you have to immediately compare it to the other films. In doing that, even before seeing the movie you knew it wasn't going to be better then Raiders and those who though it would be would leave disappointed. Well, I didn't think it would be better and yet I can't help but feel disappointed in the final product of the film. While it does have the essentials to make an Indiana Jones film, there are too many things that they seem to have skipped in order to make an actual great film. Thus we have to settle for something that is simply good, which is fine, but not when you are Indiana Jones.Indiana Jones has crossed his way into the new age of film and George Lucas seems to have brought the heavy duty CGI with him. This has many pros and cons. While the CGI can create elaborate and exciting action sequences, it can't help but feel fake. The car chase through the jungle is exhilarating and ranks up with the some of the best action sequences in the series, but it is ruined with ridiculous scenes of sword play and Tarzan swinging, both from the same character. A character who seems to only have been added to draw a younger crowd and possibly pass the torch on.Therein lies a problem with the script, it's characters. Allen is given absolutely nothing to do but bat her eyes at Ford. In Raiders she was a tough broad, here she has nothing. Winstone plays Mac, a good/bad guy who adds nothing to the plot whatsoever. Cate Blanchett seems to be having some fun in her role, yet her character is no where as evil or memorable as previous 'villains' in the series. It is mentioned she has psychic powers, yet that aspect is never explored. LaBeouf, I have always been a fan of. He has comedic talent, from his Disney days and can handle action films, as evident with Last years ""Transformers"". Ford of course still has his Indy chops, he actually looks like he is having fun again. It seemed that age got the best of Ford in the recent years, but here he engages more. Then we have hurt we seems to be there as an excuse to get characters to where they need to go.In the Indy series there has always been a suspension of disbelief. The Holy Grail, Ark of the Covenant and Sacred Stones don't really seem plausible. Yet we took it at face value and since all of those artifacts were based on our history it had a certain bit of grounded reality to them. Crystal Skull throws all of that out the window and deals with aliens. Sacrificial cults and ancient religion people can understand, but once aliens from the, and I'm quoting a line in the film, ""the spaces between spaces"" nothing seems plausible. This is the bit of the film where it seems to falls of the horse. Seeing Indy find treasures of the past is what the series was all about, with this film he seems to find things from the future. It doesn't jive very well with me. Spielberg needs to get off his alien fix in his films.It also seems like Spielberg is slacking off, as there was very evident ADR with Ford's lines. This type of stuff could easily be fixed, with cutaways, yet Spielberg for some reasons focuses on the character when this is used and it stands out like a sore thumb. The overuse of CGI doesn't feel like an Indy film either, more along the lines of a National Treasure or Laura Croft. Speaking of National Treasure, it seems like Indy is taking notes from Ben Gates. There are clues left for him throughout the film, but none of them reach the level of National Treasure or even The DaVinci Code. Now code breaking wasn't a really big thing for Indy, he dabbles a bit, but here it seems more important. Yet it is treated as a mere side road. Which is essentially fine with me, but the make it seem bigger then it is, and instead of breaking the codes later on they just listen to the old crazy guy who tells them exactly what they need to know.Indy is indeed back and the adventure and fun is there. That is what it is really all about. The fun and magic of the movies, right? If you can believe that three people can jump out of an airplane on a yellow raft and survive the fall into some rapids, then I guess you can believe a car driving over a cliff falling safely on top a tree top. Which safely places them into the water, then swings back and hits the bad guys. Convenient right? I guess the thrill and adventure of Indiana isn't the same, since so many films since the original three have ripped it off left right and centre. It seems that this films is doing the same, which is odd.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
129,pc95,Doesn't make it to it's predecessors level,6,1 August 2008,"To be fair to this brand new installment of Indiana Jones, it's hype was huge and expectations gargantuan primarily because of the history and experience of the film-makers working on it, and the pedigree of the earlier films. This sort of letdown is similar to the newer Star Wars efforts only not as acute. I thought this installment, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls got away from what made the other 3 movies better - religious undertones - (spoiler) which are more about the ancients and omnipotent rather than outer-space. This movie has a sense of betraying the original content by trying to stray away into newer ideas. I guess I'm being a traditionalist here. The genre/spirit is a bit of a let-down as a lot of the archaeological strengths/explanations in the earlier movies are vapid or feels glossed over here. Why not recall a new story with the Nazi's and a new artifact?! Anyway it's not a complete dud - there are some good chase scenes, Spielberg identifiable humor, and an entertaining maybe over-the-top opening. Harrison Ford is definitely looking and seeming his age - much more than Sean Connery was. I guess if you suspend disbelief enough and throw out your expectations based on such good prior experiences, the movie does OK on it's own.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
130,lewiskendell,Let's take a look at the facts.,6,10 June 2010,"Fact #1: Harrison Ford has still got it. The man may be closer to seventy than sixty, but he can still handle action roles like this pretty well. There were a few times during the movie where I thought he looked almost exactly like the Indy of old. My biggest concern about The Crystal Skull was that Ford had aged too much to pull it off convincingly, but he proved me wrong. Fact #2: Indy's family life bores me. It happened in The Last Crusade with his dad, and it happened again in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with Marion and Mutt. It takes away from what I personally want to see, which is Indiana being Indiana. It's great if there's a woman tagging along to flirt with him, but when relationships become the primary focus of an adventure movie, I lose interest. Fact #3: Science fiction plus Indy doesn't really work for me. I thought the movie started off OK, but the story spiraled downhill as it went on. I'm fine with Indy tracking down magical, religious, and mythological artifacts, but as soon as words like ""interdimensional"" start being thrown around, were not really in Indiana Jones territory, anymore.Fact #4: Cate Blanchett was utterly wasted. When you have an actress of that talent playing your main villain, the potential is limitless. But if the role is written to be this one-note and unremarkable, I'm not surprised that there wasn't much that she could do with it. Fact #5: Crystal Skull is still an Indiana Jones movie, which means that there's enough fun adventure to make it worth watching, despite its faults. Like I said before, the first half or so is pretty good, and the latter portion isn't bad enough to negate that. I just know how good this series can be, and I can't help being fairly critical when an entry strays from those expectations. This entry may be tied with The Last Crusade as my least favorite, but that doesn't keep it from being watchable, and occasionally thrilling.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
131,winner55,Disappointing,5,3 July 2008,"The movie falls all too easily into three distinct sections - the visit to the government storage facility moves readily into the college town affair to form one section, the search for the lost archaeologist the second, the final journey to the 'kingdom' of the title the third. Only the third section works. Ford looks way too old to be an engaging Indy in the first section, the second section tries to fit the Soviet special ops into the ""Nazi"" mold of the original series, which fails to confront the serious political issues the first section raised in a meaningful way, and only the third section delivers the action we expect of the series. It is well to remember that the Jones films were originally pastiches of 1940s adventure films; the conventions of that genre don't really suit the 1950s, and so only when the period no longer matters, in the third section, do they seem to work. And Spielberg relies way too much on the clichés he helped develop for the original series. Only the editing and the action choreography keep the pace up for the whole film. Disappointing. Hopefully the final chapter in a tired franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
132,brando647,"It has it's issues, but's a fun movie regardless...",7,9 November 2008,"I was as excited as any fan when I'd heard that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were creating a fourth film for the Indiana Jones franchise, as I have been a huge fan of the trilogy since I first saw it. I wish I could say that this film felt like a natural continuation of the original movies but, as most people seem to agree, this film just didn't seem to fit. Almost 20 years after the release of the third film, Indiana Jones returns when a young greaser named Mutt requests his help in rescuing his mother and an old colleague of Indy's. They had been captured by the Russians who are attempting to locate a legendary crystal skull in an effort to acquire it's mythical power by returning it to the lost city of Akator. So far, so good. The plot didn't seem out of place for the whip-cracking hero, but I was wrong...I will attempt to explain my views on the film without going into spoiler-territory, though I know most people have seen the film at this point (or have read enough about it to know the plot). As a stand-alone adventure film, this movie is pretty good. It has some great action scenes and plenty of adventure; it just wandered outside the realm of the usual Jones film. There were some scenes where I was left confused as to how something so ridiculous or campy could've even been considered (i.e. the refrigerator escape or the monkey chase). I was also disappointed in this film's ""MacGuffin""; I enjoyed the idea of the crystal skull in the beginning, but as soon as the film began lingering into the realm of science fiction, I was left down. The Indiana Jones films have always been grounded in reality, but incorporated religious/spiritual elements. In my opinion, going the route of science fiction sort of works against the previous three films. I understand that George Lucas wanted to give this new film a 1950's B-movie sci-fi twist, but it felt out of place.At least I was able to count on the usual great performances. Harrison Ford may be 20 years older but he's still got it in him to reprise the role of Indiana; it's almost as if he never left. It was great to see him don the fedora for another go (though if he hadn't, would ANYONE have even bothered seeing the film...?). Karen Allen returns to her role from the first film, Marion Ravenwood, and while her age Definitely shows she's still got the same spunky attitude that was a perfect counter for Indy back in 1981. Shia LeBeouf is a suitable sidekick for the installment as Mutt and Cate Blanchett is hot...er...talented as the Russian villain, Colonel Doctor Irina Spalko.Unlike a lot of the franchise fans, I didn't HATE this installment in the series. It just didn't completely feel like an Indiana Jones film; honestly, they could've replaced the main character and sold it as another franchise, and it wouldn't have taken as much flack as it did. Overall, it was still a fun movie and that is important. Throughout the film, there is rarely a boring moment and it's still filled with the brand of humor that we're accustomed to. I wouldn't mind if Spielberg and Lucas (mostly Spielberg...) decided to give the franchise another go after this one, I just hope they listen to what the fans had to say about the fourth film and take it into account...I repeat, the fridge and the monkeys were a bit extreme. Let's take it down a notch...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Led by the brilliant Irina Spalko, the Soviets tail Jones and the young man, Mutt, to Peru. With Oxley's code, they find a legendary skull made of a single piece of quartz. If Jones can deliver the skull in its rightful place, all may be well; but if Irina takes it to its origin, she'll gain powers that could endanger the West. Aging professor and young buck join forces with a woman from Jones's past to face the dangers of the jungle, Russia, and the supernatural.After the hugely entertaining first two film and a disappointing third film, Indy 4 takes a step forward on how entertaining this franchise was meant to be! I was wondering why people thought this to be an ""okay"" movie. I've also heard that one user made up the phrase, ""Nuke the fridge,"" also known as ""Jumping the shark,"" which both mean that something really impossible happened in this movie that supposedly brung the franchise down, although I doubt one scene in here brung the franchise down.Apart from that whole thing, I still had a high expectation. And with that, the film exceeded my expectations. Now picture this: Think of all of the previous 3 Indy films and in Indy 4, it's much bigger and epic and as adventurous as the previous 3. Obviously, this film has a lot of CGI, which looked great, in my opinion. The action sequences are highly entertaining and since it's an Indiana Jones movie, don't expect some logic and probable/realistic scenes.The production design look as good as ever and the performances were all great. However, I'm with the majority here: Harrison Ford may be losing his steam. Cate Blanchett played fantastically as the villain (one of the best in movies) and Shia LaBeouf is decent as Indy's new sidekick. I still think Indy's best sidekicks were in the second film. Karen Allen fits in well as she returns to her role from the first film as Indy's girlfriend. John Hurt's performance was nothing special because I swear I saw him playing the same role in another movie before.I'll say this: If you've been enjoying the Indy films since the first, you'll no doubt enjoy this one. I found it an improvement over the third, although not as good as the first two. The adventure is bigger and better, the action sequences are entertaining, and it's just a fun movie. However, I was surprised this film borrowed from other adventure films like ""National Treasure 2"" and ""The Mummy Returns."" You'll understand when you see the movie. Other than that flaw, enjoy the movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
134,bob-rutzel-1,CGI wins this one,3,23 October 2008,"Someone woke Harrison Ford up and said it's time to make another Indiana Jones movie to go look for um, ah, um a crystal skull, this time. He looked and acted like he didn't want to do it, but I think someone overheard him say, ""for the last time, okay?"" He knew all the stunt men would be in most of the action scenes, and not him. Hey,dem bones can only take so much. They forgot to tell Mr. Ford that the real star of the show would be the CGI and it was good, no doubt about it. And, they also forgot to tell him that he would be starring with a youngster who hasn't finished acting school or never went: Mr. LaBeouf. Not so good. Cate Blanchett and John Hurt were in Halloween garb and if it weren't for the movie credits no one could have guessed who they were. I didn't. The most annoying thing in the movie was the playing of Hot Potato in Reverse with the Crystal Skull as two main vehicles raced for dominance in the jungle. It went on forever and lost the audience. Oh, it was good for the first few minutes, then it went on forever. Is there an Echo in here?So we have too little Indiana Jones and too much CGI. I like CGI, but I like characters acting too, and not mumbling longitude and latitude and obscure clues like we were back in National Treasure (a better movie by the way).At the end of the movie, Indiana's hat rolls in to the church and stops at LeBeouf's feet, like he will be the next Indiana Jones. But without words, the real Indiana Jones picks up the hat and seems to say to LeBeouf: not yet, not until you go to acting school (my words).So let's hope this is the end of it. Even the Crystal Skull had enough and took off in a flying saucer. What? You missed that? What were you watching?Violence: Yes.

A long time for anticipation and reserve and worries to build. ""What if this new adventure won't live up to the past films?"" Well, don't worry, if you are a fan of the series, you are going to love ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""!Luckilly, the film has taken full advantage of this time gap, aging Indy and his world as our world has aged. Now in the 1950's, Indy finds himself in an adventure modeled clearly after the classic Sci-Fi films of that era, which is a very nice touch as the previous films were modeled after the classic film serials from the 30's and 40's. We also have new villains, Soviets, to replace the Nazi threat from past films.As the film opens, Indiana Jones (played flawlessly by the always-cool Harrison Ford) has been captured by Soviet soldiers, led by the sexy and scary Irina Spalko, who is portrayed with a devilish glee by Cate Blanchett. He is ordered to find something for them... Something he helped uncover 10 years before... Something hidden deep in a warehouse in... Area 51. After finding them the item in question (a highly magnetized box with some strange contents), Indy escapes in the first of many grand action pieces. Despite being in his 60's, Indy still has the stuff. He can swing from his whip, beat-up bad guys and save his hide as he always has. Clearly, age isn't gonna stop Indy (or Ford) from being the hero he has proved himself to be on numerous occasions.But soon, things start to look down for Indy. With FBI agents investigating him, his school asking him to take a leave of absence, and the appearance of the classic greaser Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf, in a very good performance), Indy is soon in-over-his-head in a new adventure.Mutt tells Indy about a former acquaintance (John Hurt), who had discovered a mysterious Crystal Skull in Peru... only to disappear soon after. And so, Indy and Mutt take off in search of him and the skull. And soon, a plot is set in motion that will take Indy, Mutt and some other characters, including the return of Marion Ravenwood (the feisty Karen Allen) through hell and back, in a desperate attempt to reach the fabled city of Akator (or El Durado, the city of Gold) before the Soviets... all while trying to unravel the mysteries of the Crystal Skull's power! That is the basic plot... And while it might see silly compared to the other films, I can assure you, the Sci-Fi elements actually fit in neatly with the rest of the series. Director Steven Spielberg and writers George Lucas, Jeff Nathanson and David Koepp do not forget the fundamentals of the series, and take caution in making sure it all fits together and has that Indiana Jones-feel.I would like to pause for a moment and specifically bring up how well-done the action sequences are. From a marvelous motorcycle/car chase, to a fistfight surrounded by large man-eating ants, to the amazing sword duel between Spalko and Mutt, it is all spectacular and puts a new spin on the series and its action.I feel though, that I should take some time to address some concerns that fans seem to have, and that some already are blasting the film over.First off, yes there is quite a bit of CGI work, but that is to be expected. This is an action series with serious supernatural tones and story lines, so I feel that taking a step in the digital direction with the effects is a blessing if anything. It helps the filmmakers illustrate the story on a grander scale that older effects could not. And isn't that what we want, for ""Indiana Jones"" to be all that it can?Secondly, yes the story is more Sci-Fi oriented, which seems to turn a lot of people off, but I cannot stress how much this actually works, despite sounding silly. This is Spielberg and Lucas giving a wink and a nod to the era in which the film takes place, and without giving anything away, the story is told very tastefully. You don't need to worry about this turning into ""Star Wars."" Overall, I am very pleased with this newest ""Indiana Jones"" adventure, and I would recommend it to anyone. It is certainly a great addition to the series, and it has definitely gotten me interested in the prospect of future installments!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I mean it is far away from the the third part INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE. What I missed here were aircraft and train action scenes and suspense. Compared by the dynamic countdown even the last two series of NATIONAL TREASURE with Nicolas Cage were better than this one. The fourth Indy is sometimes slow paced, poorly executed but still entertaining. I loved the action scenes at the beginning of the film but then it was dominated more and more by the computer generated imagery. At least these scenes were well executed. Anyway, the end was very disappointing and ruined by these special effects. Okay, I have to admit it was an original idea to take out a mysterious puzzle of the Mayas culture. The locations and the picture were superb but finally I completely agree with all the negative reviews that critics these special effects. Then they forgot to mix all with the very important element suspense. There were only one or two scenes that were great but that's all.

Please note that the mysterious warehouse of top-secret artifacts is there also. Shia LaBeouf showed great promise here as ""Indy Jr."". Karen Allen still has it and she is a great co-star after so many years. There is much intentional similarity here to the other 3 films. I especially like the totally impossible ""3 waterfall drop"" in what appears to be a recycled amphibious ""Duck"". I rode in one of these many years ago in Wisconsin. They are not really as nimble, fast or seaworthy as they are in this movie! The last 50 minutes are spellbinding and like all ""Indy"" films, totally outrageously implausible. The villain dies a terrible death, as she ""melts away"" after absorbing too much alien energy and knowledge. Somewhat similar to the Nazi ""Rabbi"" in Raiders.

(Janusz Kaminski) just don't trust sunlight any more  the ""outdoor"" scenes reek of studio fakery, everyone in the open looking like a glazed donut.We dive into the usual gamut of pulp implausibility (how many rounds can a trained soldier fire at Indy point blank without hitting him?; how many falls can a 65 year-old sustain without seeking medical advice?; how many rocketsleds, complete with Roger Ebert's Red Digital Readout, are conveniently fueled and operational for a *deus ex machina* escape from Damn Russkies?)...Ray Winstone is Indy's plump sidekick this time 'round, John Hurt mumbles a lot, and Shia LeBeouf does his Brando Wild One to capture the youth market that Indy once cornered simply by unbuttoning his shirt.Turns out Shia isn't a mini-Marlon after all - he's a mini-Indy; spawned from Karen Allen, who reprises her role as love interest (although the interest from Indy's public would likely be more nostalgic than romantic; euuww! We don't particularly want to see our grandparents playing patticake).When the titular Crystal Skull is discovered things get *really* goofy.Looking suspiciously like H.R. Giger's ALIEN (1989), the elongated, transparent artifact causes people to go Communist if they gaze at it, which is why the dominatrix and her Damn Russkie soldiers want to unleash it on the weak-minded public.Spielberg is still a masterful movie-maker, Ford still Total Action Man, but Lucas starts throwing so many idiot curve balls that it is only a matter of time before the movie strikes out: telepathy, auto-writing, extra-terrestrial aliens spawning ancient Earth civilizations, predestination and prophecies, a Mayan step pyramid as hangar for a spaceship  everything for the weak-minded to curl their little insubstantial brains around it all ends up very Von Daniken, only missing the zeppelin flashing an ad for CHARIOTS OF THE GODS.By the time Shia is swinging on liana vines like Tarzan to head off the chase scene, I simply wrote in my notes  like those splash-phrases that marketers sell to the media - ""irretrievably silly."" Yes, we all know it's pulp and Saturday afternoon serial, but the whole enterprise is too self-aware to be innocently enjoyable. Action is merely action and stunts is jess stunts if the story is less than compelling. Indy and Co. try to return the skull to its rightful resting place, courtesy of John Hurt's mumbling, which is inside a Mayan pyramid. Turns out the alien skull, when returned to its crystal skeleton, makes thirteen alien skeletons meld into each other to form a LIVE SCARY ALIEN who launches his spaceship after burning out the eye sockets of the dominatrix. Well, told you it was stupid!...And mean-spirited too! Why are Spielberg's aliens now so hostile? What makes a man with Spielberg's once-hopeful vision (E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS) flip-flop to portray aliens with such rage? The CLOSE ENCOUNTERS aliens were kind, beneficent, musical; whereas the alien who confronts his wife here is howlin' mad for some reason.Cate simply ""wanted to know""  she sought knowledge  and the alien fried her brain. In CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, Richard Dreyfuss also ""wanted to know"" and he was invited aboard the alien spaceship for brunch. Isn't Cate the smart one here  even WITH the bad Ukraine accent? Isn't she the only one exhibiting a smidgeon of scientific curiosity? Instead, we get another reference to better times and better movies (to wit: the STAR WARS franchise), when Harrison forebodes, ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" just before everything turns pear-shaped and Cate is incinerated for her inquisitiveness. Guess the aliens did that to Dreyfuss AFTER the Director's Cut wrapped filming inside the mothership John Hurt stops mumbling for one second to specify that the spaceship disappears ""not into space  into the space between spaces,"" which touches on the only cogent scientific theory in the whole movie - membrane theory (aka ""brane"" theory), but was treated as mystically as the rest of the guff, so that no one  especially not the weak-minded  would accidentally learn anything.A weak marriage ceremony later (Karen Allen and Ford, limply exchanging vows simply to comply with Romantic Ending Protocol), Shia almost puts on the infamous fedora, as if a torch is about to be passed  but the moment is stolen from him as Ford grabs the hat and exits with his new bride. As if crowning himself.Even WITH the buttoned shirt, Indy is still the King of Pulp",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
142,KUAlum26,"It's not gonna make you forget the prior Indy films,but so what?",8,27 May 2008,"To be honest,when I heard--I'd put it at about two years ago--that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were putting together another Indiana JOnes movie,and that it would bring Harrison Ford back as the only tenured college professor to moonlight as a whip-and-pistol wielding archaeologist and erstwhile treasure hunter,I was a little skeptical and more than a little reticent. I mean,I think most men would want to age like Harrison(there are guys who don't physically past muster at 35 or 45 that he can at 65!),but still,how do you re-vamp an action adventure franchise behind a Social Security-eligible leading actor and a storyline and series that's had eighteen years to be in mothballs and get a similar audience and end product.Oh,I of little faith.Now,to be sure,this fourth edition to the series will not make you forget the first three forays into the wilds(which were spaced out between 1981 and 1989;less than half the amount of down time to this opus) and,with the Nazis out of the way,it seems as if the formidable foes for the intrepid adventurer and friends would be somewhat tougher to fill in without using a variety of ""Old Age"" jokes,but then the creators of the show--Spielberg the director,Lucas as co-producer and acclaimed screenwriter David Koepp--got wise and allowed the story to age as naturally as the actor himself. Set some eighteen years after Indy and his dad(and this point here is a little tricky for me,since I was once under the impression that the storyline actually went backwards,with the Raiders of the Lost Ark being actually the last,but anyway...)securing the Holy Grail from Hitler and his minions,Indy is still globe-trotting,still of great interest to various governments with often nefarious designs. This time,if it's the 1950s,it ""must"" be the Russkies,and they're after various artifacts and elements,both scientific and paranormal,that will help them win the Cold War. Their leader is a steely,seductive quasi-mystic (CAte Blanchett,shelving her usual blonde,earthy sexuality for a dark wig,disciplinarian military outfit and icy outfit)and she believes she has some sort of kinship with our hero. While Commies may not(particularly since the Cold War's dissolution almost twenty years ago)be quite as hissable villains as the Nazis(or for that matter,child-enslaving middle eastern Demi-Gods),the sight of dour,stern,physically imposing soldiers wielding HAmmers and Sickles is still good for a menacing opposition.BAck into the fray--and by my opine,happily so--is KAren Allen as Indy's scrappy mate Marion RAvenwood,who is a captured pawn of the Soviets,there to draw out both JOnes and his new sidekick,a smarter-than-he-looks greaser named Mutt(Shia LeBouef). Supporting turns by JOhn Hurt(as a former colleague of Indy's,driven apparently mad by the title's central object),Ray Winstone(as INdy's weak and treacherous compatriot)and Jim Broadbent(taking over for the late Denholm Elliott's character,the likable but overwhelmed college colleague and erstwhile close friend)fill in the blanks nicely,though anybody with a fondness for the previous movies will still miss what they brought. Just like seeing an old friend again,this movie actually satisfies a little bit better than returns of Superman,BAtman or the Hulk(as examples)since those characters can be made as much by CGI(sometimes more) as by actors. Jones is practically all Ford's,and the fact that he's still able to bring what's expected to it:namely the fusion of intelligence,dry charm and humor to his physical presence nearly makes this movie worth the price of admission alone. While this film feels like a fall-off from the previous efforts(much like the three ""prequel"" trilogy movies attributed to that other George Lucas mega-franchise),it's not THAT big of a slide. My previous doubts were ill-founded;you CAN keep a character thriving and with it the franchise,so long as you keep the principle components(in a word,familiarity) in tact.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
143,Pumpkin_Man,Dr. Jones is Back!!!,8,16 August 2009,"Like the other great classic heroes of the 80's, Indiana Jones makes an awesome comeback! I thought the movie was really good and had the classic look of the 1950's! It was cool that the Ark from the original had a brief appearance! It was also awesome to see Marion from 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' back and helping Indy against Russians who are after the Crystal Skull. Shia LaBeouf does an awesome job as a greaser named Mutt Williams who is Marion's son that helps Indy on his journey too. There are some jokes about Indy's age throughout the film which is pretty funny! If you are a big INDIANA JONES fan, then you'll love INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
144,Sirus_the_Virus,"Ford still has it. After all this time, he is still whipped into shape.",8,2 August 2009,"People called the newest Indiana Jones film, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, a major letdown. I will disagree. I really did like it, though it wasn't the best. I thought it was a fun film, though it was silly at times. Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones for the forth time. This time, Jones is in a battle against the soviets to find the crystal skulls. THe villain is Irina Spalko(Cate Blanchett, who is very convincing as a Ukrainian woman). Jones teams up with a greaser named Mutt(Shia Lebeouf) to help find Proffesor Oxley(John Hurt), who looked into the skulls eyes and went nuts. They are also in search for Mutt's mother. Mutt's mother is actually Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen) from the original. She hasn't changed at all. Jones finds out many things in this film. This film has things that you never expected. Like the secret behind the crystal skulls is a huge surprise. The original is on my top three list. So I like that one the most. I liked The Last Crusade second most. I liked Crystal Skull the third most, then I liked The Temple of Doom the least. So I don't like it the least, but second least. THe new Jones film is very entertaining and very fun. Though I thought some of it was ridiculous, I still give Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a big recommendation.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
145,bobsgrock,"It's fun for some, disappointing for others.",7,29 May 2008,"After a long nineteen year wait, Indiana Jones is back on the big screen hamming it up and continuing his search for rare and wild artifacts that could seriously take someone's life away. This film has Jones in the late 1950s fighting against the Soviets in order to obtain a crystal skull found in Peru which they believe will give them absolute knowledge over all other countries. Without telling the spoilers, it is important to state right here and now that this is definitely the weakest written of the four films. It simply doesn't give the magic and suspense that Raiders was able to throughout the entire running time. Of course the acting is good with Harrison Ford looking as good as ever and Karen Allen and Shia Labeouf supporting him well. The directing by Steven Spielberg is solid as we get some nice chase scenes and the pace is just fine. Still, it's that script that is giving me winces of pain as I watch this film. Of course, you shouldn't go into this thinking it was going to be as good or better than Raiders or the Last Crusade. I didn't expect too much and that is exactly what I got; not too much but enough to recommend for all fans of the original three to see. Are the first three the best? Of course. Should they have made this fourth one? Probably not. Still, if you are a fan, it doesn't hurt too much to see Indy crack the whip one more time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
146,lambiepie-2,"Steven, George, David and John...",7,26 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdon of the Crystal Skull is entertaining. Very entertaining. And like most folks here, it was a pleasure to see Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones crack that whip once more and teach that ...archeology is not just meant for the classroom, you've got to go out and dig too. And dig we did. And that wasn't just meant for 'archeology'. It was absolutely meant for THIS film, and everyone involved.So ...as I sat in the theater watching this film unfold I felt I was also watching a team of four do some archeology of their own and tip a hat to themselves, and what made them what we know of them today. All of this wrapped up in this installment of Indiana Jones. T here is no denying all the styles of these folks were there and all the whimsy of what made these four the tops in Hollywood today is all there too. For example, critics have said, ""The script is bad"" but if you dig a bit deeper, you'll come to understand that the script is ""what it is"" and it isn't ""bad"", it's actually inspired and pure David Knopp - just as George Lucas inspired touches and no one can miss Steven's and of course John Williams score and popular Indiana Jones theme to drive it all along.Yes, this was a team effort -- with team input -- and something to remind you the movie goer that ""..in a time, not so long ago, when Hollywood took big chances on young directors, writers and producers, they made history in entertainment. No need to copy or redo, it's been done, and was done well. Now it's time to give the new ideas their chance too."" Far fetched? Err, not if you really watch Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull again - and do a little digging for yourself. Sure it helps to know a bit about Steven, George, David and John's history from a few decades ago to drive you along to now and this - but that's the fun of archeology - it's in the discovery after you dig. Just like Indy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
147,mstomaso,"Cute, Silly, Adrenalized Adventure",5,1 June 2008,"You do not need to be a professional archaeologist (which I am) to note the myriad inaccuracies and absurdities in any Indiana Jones film. I have always enjoyed attending these films with friends and, at the end, saying something like ""just another day at the office"".The latest, and quite likely the last in the Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones series introduces a new, young, and likable sidekick (Mutt Williams - Shia LeBeouf) and brings back Indy's only true love Marian Ravenwood (Karen Allen). The rest of the cast exudes star power - Kate Blanchett is a dark-haired Russian agent leading a military expedition to steal what she believes to be a powerful mind-control device, John Hurt is the deranged colleague of Dr. Jones (Oxley) who has spent too many hours staring into the orbits of the crystal skull, and a recognizable support cast full of Eastern European and English character actors backs them up.Despite the pedigrees, some of the acting in this film fails to hit the mark. Karen Allen was not terribly believable in some scenes, and Ray Winstone also had a few very weak moments (mainly due to the sub-par script). Kate Blanchett, who is always an extraordinary presence, did about as well as she could with the living stereotype the script created for her. Harrison Ford was, of course, great, and looked as if he really enjoyed visiting his old friend Henry Jones Jr. The stunt work and CGI were almost good enough to convince you that Mr. Ford was actually in most of the film.This brings up the key to the film. Crystal Skull is a pure action film, in which the plot (though typically convoluted) is very much secondary to live action stunts straight out of Road Runner or Tom and Jerry cartoons and elaborate CGI. Entertaining for fans of the series, but analogous to a bowl of highly sugared breakfast cereal - satisfying while its happening, but won't keep you going all day long.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
148,emasterslake,After years of waiting it's finally here.,8,26 May 2008,"As far back as 2003, I kept expecting this movie to be one of a kind. After many delays and resubmitted release dates it's finally an official movie. We all know the world re-known Dr. Indiana Jones from the first 3 films set in the 30s.Now we see him 19 years older and still has plenty of adventure left in him. It's 1957, the Cold War was still going at large. While Indiana has for sometime been helping the government hunt down Red spies of the Soviet Union. During his struggle in figuring out what the Red Army is after. Dr. Jones is met by Mutt who was a student of Dr. Oxley, an old friend of Indy's back in archeology studies.Dr. Oxley has been trying to uncover the secrets of the Crystal Skulls that have an unknown origin to them. During his travels to the Amazon. He went missing, and Mutt wants Indiana's help in finding the whereabouts of Oxley in South America. So they head for South America to look for clues to what Oxley was seeking. But they're not the only ones looking for the secrets of the Crystal Skull. As the Red Army themselves want to steal it's secrets.As predicted, this movie delivers a well entertaining sequel that has the same levels as the previous 3. After an unknown number of scripts the idea of the crystal skulls turns out to be a great idea for an Indy adventure.Even though it features Harrison Ford showing his age. He still has the ability to reprise his trademark role even after all these years. Even though it didn't had anyone else reprising their roles from the previous 3. It still has everything you want a Indiana Jones movie to be.The setting, I'm only a little familiar with the 50's era. But the movie does reenact the era perfectly with the clothing, the cars, and the technology.The new cast, besides only seeing 2 familiar Indy characters. The rest of the cast were suitable for their own roles and a lot of them really brought out their own character for their parts.The cinematography, the action sequences and the entirely different fight scenes make the movie feel fresh and Indiana Jones like at the same. I like how the new Camera man tried to mimic how the previous camera did the first 3 to give it the same look of camera shots.The locations, plenty of Midwest scenes set in the 50's were well done for the movie. Especially how they shot certain locations to make it feel like you're seeing Peru and the Amazon river.The story and plot, I give George Lucas and Steven Spielberg credit for choosing a story on an artifact that's rarely heard of these days. Over the years people predicted it having to do with Escalabur or the lost Continent. But the Crystal Skull is something that's rarely heard of or mention at this time of age. So they use that as the main subject of Indiana Jone's adventure. I also like how they maintain the look of this film to be more like the previous 3 by not over doing the use of CGI.Only certain animals, certain vehicle flying/crashing scenes, and a few supernatural related scenes were done on computer. So in the end, I like how the movie was still appealing for having those sequences done on computer.If you like the first 3, then this one should be worth seeing as the final Indiana Jones movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
149,ElijahCSkuggs,Indy tackles the Unknown and Important,8,22 May 2008,"The latest and last Indiana Jones flick is popcorn madness at it's best. From amazing, ridiculously unbelievable action sequences to over-the-top villains and a fantastic adventure bound story. This should please every action/adventure out there, to some degree.The story, which revolves around real-life mysteries was really, really well done. Myself being a believer that Alien-life and the discovery of Aliens is the most important subject on our hands, was very happy to see this flick wrangle such a cool concept. They even discussed serious thoughts on Aliens, being that alien civilizations have flourished due to combining their collective thought. Which is something we also need to do in a way to truly evolve. Unfortunately, we'll probably never accomplish this, unless something drastic occurs. Aliens showing their face would probably do it. Anyways, I loved the story.My only gripe with the film was our main villain played by Cate Blanchett. Her character would have been much more effective if she wasn't so talky. But I suppose that's not her fault, but of the writers. Also, the CGI was kinda noticeable. Besides that stuff, the movie was a really fun ride, that delivers the Indiana feel and the Indiana ride. 8.5 outta 10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
150,hnt_dnl,"Doesn't capture the 80s magic, but don't think as bad as people say",6,1 April 2010,"First off, I'm not the biggest Indiana Jones fan, the movies I mean. But it's more b/c they're not my cup of tea than the fact that I don't think they're good movies. I've seen them all and my conclusion on the first three films is that A) RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is definitely a great flick and homage, but I think some of the scenes are overly talky and it has a weak final act and therefore somewhat overrated. But it did start it all.B) TEMPLE OF DOOM is 100% unadulterated, fast-paced fun and my absolute favorite Indy flick! Always has been. But I don't love TOD b/c it's an Indy flick, but more so b/c it is one of the most purely entertaining movies I've ever seen. If I can watch a flick this many years later and continue to enjoy it w/o getting bored or tired, to me, that's a great flick! And in this one, I feel that Ford full-throttle captures the essence of Indy.C) THE LAST CRUSADE is totally overrated! It was more Hollywood gimmickry pairing Sean Connery with Harrison Ford and casting Ford as his Dad. At the time, Connery was big in Hollywood having just won an Oscar for UNTOUCHABLES and was being cast in a lot of big flicks and his casting was to continue to cash in on that. But TLC was just a retread of the Nazi theme from RAIDERS with much less interesting villains and a blonde bimbo fashion model character that couldn't touch either Marion from RAIDERS or Willie from TOD.Now, as for the character, it is not even a question that Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones! As soon as I saw this latest Indy offering INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL and Ford's early scenes, it immediately reminded me of this iconic character. For me, Ford had a lot of good, humorous lines in this film and I totally bought that he was Indy again! CRYSTAL SKULL as a film is definitely fairly weak, and that is sadly a function of today's films focusing too much on CGI. It's almost filmmakers have forgotten how to entertain us with more realistic-looking effects and set pieces (or they just don't feel like trying anymore). And there is CGI up the wazoo in this thing! But I kind of accept that this is the new path that movies go to. But it doesn't feel like an Indy film with all this CGI in it.Plot-wise, I actually think the first half of CRYSTAL SKULL is pretty solid entertainment with Indy fighting and dodging the Russian KGB agents led by Cate Blanchett's character; I have to admit, as soon as I saw Blanchett, I almost stopped watching the movie b/c this felt like some kind of weird casting gimmick and I tend to wince when I see some big, high-fallutin Oscar winning ""serious"" actor in the type of film I want to be purely entertained by, but her character actually grew on me as she really got into the role of an Indy villain; she was pure evil and badass and THAT is how I want my Indy villains to be! Also, I wasn't sure if I'd like Shia Labeouf in a flick like this and I do really like Labeouf as an up and coming young actor. For me, he was the best character and one of the very few saving graces of TRANSFORMERS! And again in this movie, Labeouf shows that he has acting skill and the ability to draw you in to his character in a movie. But he needs to choose better scripts than this one! That said, though, I can think of a bunch of other actors Shia's age that would have totally screwed this role up and looked ridiculous. Shia did not! It was great to see Karen Allen's return to the role of Marion she made famous in RAIDERS. And what very few interactions Ford and Allen had were cool to see. The way they look at each other throughout the film just reminds one of how much chemistry they had in the original and that Marion is THE ONE for Indy!The second half of CRYSTAL SKULL went off the rails, though, as the CGI started to really take over with crazy, all-too unrealistic looking stunts and scenarios. I KNOW it's an Indy film, but this one went batty on the lack of believability. Seems like Lucas and Spielberg spiraled out of control in the last act and were just trying to finish the flick with the plot, too, which got to be very incoherent.The bonus of the film is that there are a lot of moments that reminded me of the 80s movies. Some of it was manufactured with situations or set pieces that were obviously set up to parody or resemble the originals. But much of the humor was pretty spot on. I've read that people thought Ford seemed uncomfortable playing Indy again, but for the most part, he actually seemed to be having fun. THAT is the Indy I want to see!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
151,jaredmobarak,So much time wasted in human life waitingIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,6,19 May 2008,"I'll tell you, nothing gets one's heart pounding more than a nostalgic theme song score playing during a film. Nothing is more iconic than John Williams' music when it comes to Indiana Jones, unless you count the humor, the adventure, the whip, and the hat. Steven Spielberg even goes out of his way to show the silhouetted professor place said hat upon his head before we even catch a glimpse of the man himself. From the start, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull transports you back to the 80's when the series had its run. It is pretty much as though no one involved had missed a beat during the 19-year layoff from Jones' ""Last Crusade."" We are thrust into the action, unknowing how we got there and how he has been captured. None of it matters, though, the Russians need him to find an artifact and he complies until his moment of escape presents itself. Jones' incorrigible demeanor and never say die attitude is still hiding behind the aged wrinkles, finding release every chance it gets right to the end of what turns out to be a faithful new installment to a classic series of cinema. What problems it has in trying to be a bit too extraordinary it more than makes up for in tone and overall sheer enjoyment.Harrison Ford is pretty astonishing here, showing that age means nothing when it comes to breathing life into a role that he made famous and vice versa. His delivery of cynical, stubborn wit coupled with the geeky wonder at discovering the answers to clues and puzzles hasn't missed a single beat. Just look to the ""dry sand"" sequence and see what I meanthis is one college professor that truly dives into his work. All the prerequisites are included for his character to keep continuity. We receive mention of Henry Sr., (Sean Connery is sorely missed here, but hey, the first two films succeeded without him), and Marcus Brody, while also being treated to some physical humor involving none other than a mammoth snakeevery hero needs a mortal fear. Callbacks abound, including a fantastic glimpse at the ever-elusive ark, and it doesn't take long to get caught up in the action and really start pulling for these adventurers to come out victorious.The story at hand includes much of the series' trademark mysticism, leading all those involved on a quest to return the mysterious crystal skull to its rightful place, theoretically opening the doors to a treasure trove of gold. All the old stories about how the pyramids were created come into play with this quartz artifact, sculpted against the grain in a process that would destroy the whole if ever attempted by man. With its impossible magnetic pulse and draw of the mind to its eyes, no one quite knows what to make of it, except the fact that it must be returned. Of course, Indy and his band of misfits are on the journey to restore equilibrium and maybe uncover a mystery that the history books will never forget. Hot on his heels, though, are the Russians being led by the ruthless Irina Spalko, (an interesting Cate Blanchett), trekking across the world for the wealth hidden within the skullknowledge and power the likes no gold could compare to.I really must thank Spielberg et al for stepping up to the plate and making this film, for the most part, in the style of the originals. Worries were definitely setting in from the badly blue-screened trailer and the CGI rodent popping up from the underground in the very first frame. However, the oldstyle font and glorious film grain of real live film stock brought me back to ease into the proceedings with faith it what could occur. All the action hijinks are herecar chases, crawling though cobwebbed tunnels, running against time down ancient architectural structures, and some good old fist fights complete with way too loud sound effects just a hair off timing-wise (vintage Jones). My favorite sequence is probably the motorcycle chase towards the beginning. Commencing with a brilliantly orchestrated soda shop brawl, continuing through town with screeching starts and stops, and finishing in the college library after a sliding entrance under tables, one couldn't ask for a better payoff than a student asking his professor a question as he rises from the floor like this happens everyday.I give tons of credit for the bringing back of Karen Allen as Marion and even the inclusion of Shia LaBeouf's MuttI don't care what anyone says, the kid is good. And the addition of two favorites of mine, Ray Winstone and John Hurt can only help any film. Why am I just heaping praise right now? Oh, right, it's because the hammer is about to drop. I have not read Frank Darabont's rejected script, so who knows what he had up his sleeve, but this one falls apart completely at the end for me; I had a blast for the entire thing until the end climax. I can handle the supernatural and the questioning of alien life as a possible answer to the unanswerable questions in life, but David Koepp takes it too far. I laughed at the badly animated sword fight, I shook my head at the Tarzan sequence, but what happens at the end only made me think, why? Why did you have to go there when everything was so splendidly steeped in wonder while still grounded in reality? I guess you can't have perfection bringing back a saga like Indiana Jones from the dead, but I applaud them for the attempt and almost getting it right.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
152,classicalsteve,Essentially Generic Indiana Jones Flick That Relies Too Much on Formula-- 1 and 3 are Still the Best,6,7 February 2009,"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" seems like it was produced three years after the third installment instead of 20 years later. All the typical Indiana Jones devices are here: the insurmountable predicaments, jeep chases, crazy sword fights, femme fatales, man-eating insects, secret temples that collapse, the one-line zingers, ancient peoples with paint on their faces, and bad guys with sinister accents. You always know who the bad guys are by their accents. The only difference is now they're Russians instead of Germans. And there are numerous little in-jokes referencing the other films. Crystal Skull is moderately entertaining but unfortunately never transcends what has gone before--the movie felt like a by-the-numbers Indiana flick that was not much of an original contribution to the Indiana Jones canon. It's typical Indiana Jones stuff, but as another reviewer pointed out, it is as if the whole Indiana Jones series has not evolved one iota. ""Crystal Skull"" seems more of a recapitulation of Indiana Jones devices than a truly original story. Maybe I wanted a more ambiguous premise than the good Americans battling the bad commies. And for me, the final climactic solution was a little bit of a let down.We are now in the 1950's and in the middle of the Cold War. References to anti-communist McCarthy sentiment and even a bit about nuclear testing occur in the first half hour of the movie, and I expected that these subjects would somehow be enfolded into the overall rhetoric of the film, but they never do. It lapses back into the tried and true formula of the bad guys vs the good guys. The Russian baddies are led by a sexless ""comrade"" Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) who looks like a German dominatrix who would terrify the likes of Adolf Hitler. She and her band of Russian lackeys (who don't seem to have minds of their own) are now appropriating ancient Crystal Skulls. Not to give too much away, but the goal is to make everyone's mind in the world more like hers: turn the world population into these sort of sexless automatons that are fiercely loyal to the Soviet state. Now that is evil! The Soviets have obtained most of the skulls, still trying to unlock their secrets, and they kidnap Indiana Jones to help them confiscate the remaining ones. After escaping their custody, Jones is befriended by a greaser kid, replete with leather jacket and motorcycle, who claims to be the adopted son of an archaeologist known to Jones, Prof Oxley. Oxley, who had been receiving death threats, is currently missing and the kid asks Jones for help. The only clues are the kid's recollection of Oxley's discussions about a crystal skull and some strange symbols he has written on some scratch paper. In true Indiana style, Jones deciphers the symbols. The trail leads them to Latin America to retrace Oxley's steps to find out what he was doing, presumably looking for the crystal skull. To me the strongest moments were the deciphering of the clues and retracing the steps of the lost archaeologist. I wanted to see more of the unraveling of the mystery rather than the long action sequences. I know I know. Americans can't deal with too much story. Better to throw in an action sequence when things get too complicated. And the longer the better.Of course, the kid and Jones obtain the desired object of their quest when the Russians show up and capture them, just like in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I couldn't help but remember Belloq's line from the first movie: ""So once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."" And who should also be the unwilling guests of the Russians but Oxley, who has lost his mind and, guess who? Karen Allen reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood from the first film. Wasn't she also a prisoner of the Nazis in the first film? At one point she's even gagged the same way. It's getting to be a little too much like deja vu all over again...The meaning of the crystal skull starts to take a back seat to the crazy jeep chase through the jungle, which only lasts about 3 hours. And some aspects of the crystal skull, especially regarding Oxley, were a bit unclear. When the car chase was over and the exploration continues it got interesting again but as I stated earlier, the final climactic resolution was a bit of a let-down for me. This is essentially basic Indiana Jones fair. No additives or preservatives. Maybe this time I wanted something a little different, and it seemed a story that wanted to explore something about the west vs east cold war dilemma was waiting to break through, but the filmmakers decided against going in that direction. In a lot of ways, all you have to do is substitute the ark of the covenant with the crystal skull and Belloq with Irina Spalko and it is the first movie. Maybe Indiana needed a bit more ambiguous dilemma to conquer. I'll certainly concede it was an entertaining flick, but I doubt I'll watch it again any time soon. And of course, this film will not help improve American-Russian relations, but that's a whole other subject.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
153,hall895,It's nice to have Indy back,7,31 December 2008,"It is nice to see Indiana Jones again after all this time. But unfortunately this movie doesn't quite seem worthy of the movie hero we've come to know and love. It's reasonably enjoyable but in the end you're left with the sense that it works more as a nostalgia trip then it does as an actual movie.As with any movie the most important thing is the story. And therein lies this movie's biggest problem. Almost twenty years away and this is the best Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and friends could come up with? It boggles the mind. Aside from great characters the original Indy movies were driven by quests for fascinating, well-known relics. Well except for Temple of Doom but we'll ignore that for the moment since that was far and away the least enjoyable of the first three films anyway. Everybody knows the Lost Ark. Everybody knows the Holy Grail. As such you don't have to spend half the film explaining what it is your movie is actually about. This crystal skull thing? What...the...heck? Actually it is a bit like Temple of Doom in that you spend the whole film wondering what in the world this is all about and why you should even care. But maybe here it will all come together in the end, everything will be explained, there will be a great payoff and all the story's failings will be forgiven. Alas, that is not to be the case. The movie's ending falls completely flat and certainly does not redeem what came before it.So now I've made it seem that this must be a rather terrible movie. But that's not true. The story is exceptionally disappointing but there are enough things here to make the film at least passable. Harrison Ford is as perfect as ever in the role of Indy. Back for the first time since Indy's first film go-around is Karen Allen playing Indy's long-ago love interest Marion Ravenwood. The film perks up noticeably when Allen arrives on the scene. It's great to have Marion back. Aside from the requisite villain (Cate Blanchett this time who is fine but not particularly memorable in her role) the main addition to our cast of characters is Mutt Williams, a young sidekick tagging along with Indy on his journey. The less said about this character the better. Spielberg has tried so hard to make this character cool and hip that he comes off as comically uncool. If you have to try to be cool you're not cool. Shia LaBeouf plays Mutt and his performance actually is not that bad, it's just that his character doesn't fit. They just had to throw a youthful character into the mix to appeal to the younger audience didn't they? Indy didn't need a sidekick but if he had to have one...well, where's Sean Connery when you need him? The movie certainly has plenty of flaws but there are enough great Indy moments to make it worthwhile. Admittedly there are some truly cringe-inducing moments as well. You'll know them when you see them...the unfortunate fridge thing stands out. I'm not crazy about the ants either. And then there are the monkeys. Oh dear God, the monkeys. Seriously who sits down to write an action scene for an Indiana Jones movie and thinks to himself, ""You know what this scene needs? Monkeys."" The worst moment in the Indy saga bar none. You may want to cover your eyes or even throw things at the screen. It's that bad. But I'll forgive Spielberg and Lucas their sins. They may not have made a great movie but there's enough here to remind us of why we loved Indy in the first place. So thanks for bringing Indy back. Don't take twenty years for the next one and try to come up with a story that people can actually embrace. And no monkeys.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
154,Beta_Gallinger,"Of the four Indiana Jones films, this is the only one I can describe as dull!",5,2 December 2009,"After the end of the original trilogy of Indiana Jones films, starring Harrison Ford, a TV show called ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" (which I haven't seen), starring Sean Patrick Flanery, was made. However, after 1989's ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", there wasn't another theatrical movie in the franchise with Ford for a long time. It finally happened after nearly two decades, when ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" came into theatres last year, for which Ford reprised his famous role. It had been so long since the last installment in the franchise, so it obviously wouldn't be quite the same, and it's no surprise that this fourth installment has been a disappointment to many fans. The writers may have tried to recapture the magic of the original trilogy, but unsurprisingly, they failed.The year is 1957, during the Cold War, and Indiana Jones and George ""Mac"" McHale are kidnapped by Soviet agents, led by Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko! Indy is forced to help them find a crate containing the remains of an extraterrestrial being. After the crate is found, the archaeologist tries to escape, but is betrayed by Mac, making it more of a challenge to do so! Indy still does manage to escape, surviving by the skin of his teeth, but is soon questioned by FBI agents, due to Mac's Soviet ties. He is then offered indefinite leave of absence to prevent him from being fired, but before he leaves on a train, a young greaser named Mutt Williams stops him and informs him that his former colleague, Harold Oxley, was kidnapped after finding a crystal skull in Peru! Indy and Mutt go there together, and learn that Oxley was locked up in a psychiatric hospital before he was kidnapped, and in his former cell, they find the skull. Shortly after they leave, they are captured by Soviet forces, who are Indy's enemy on this mission! The beginning of this fourth Indiana Jones movie is a little shaky, but when the scene with Indy searching for the crate in the warehouse comes, that's when the suspense begins. The suspense continues during his escape, but unfortunately, it doesn't last after that. There isn't much more excitement, with the exception of the sand pit scene and part of the big chase, though even that one loses it eventually. Self-parody shows at times, with such scenes as the jungle swinging. I also didn't find much humour in this film. If Oxley's dementedness caused by the skull is supposed to be funny, it's not. In fact, it's pretty stupid, and is another problem with the film. John Hurt is a good actor, but was not given a very good role here, and probably didn't have the best script to work with. In addition to these flaws, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" drags at times, often gets a little confusing, and eventually proves to be tedious.I think ""Temple of Doom"" is by far the weakest film in the original Indiana Jones trilogy, and I know many would agree with me, but this recent film is even weaker than that. I think those two films are fairly weak for different reasons. In ""Temple of Doom"", Willie Scott, played by Kate Capshaw, is not a very impressive comic relief, and there's too much brutality for an action adventure movie, but I wouldn't say the movie is dull. My main problem with ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is that I would definitely say it IS dull! I can't describe any of the first three installments in the franchise as dull, but that's not the case with this fourth one! The first three all have lots of adrenaline-inducing action and suspense, even the second one, which is mostly fun for the first approximate hour, before it gets too disturbing, but this one doesn't have much of that at all. The action is certainly there, but it doesn't have the same effect. It looks like a fifth Indiana Jones movie will be made, which is probably not a good idea.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
155,vip_ebriega,"""Indiana Jones. I always knew some day you'd come walking back through my door.""",10,7 December 2008,"My Take: A silly, enjoyable nostalgic trip back to the grand old classic adventure. Even after 19 years, Harrison Ford is still Dr. Jones!Well Marion, I couldn't agree more! Even with the 19 year delay, Indy's, our Indy, is finally back and whatever reaction inflicted at this new fourth adventure, whether good or bad, what won me over was the nostalgia. INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (which has probably the longest title for a movie we'll ever have this year) maybe a film too big to live up to everyone's expectations, but it's exactly what I expected it too be: A wildly exhilarating adventure packed with old-fashioned swashbuckling action, nostalgic goodies that ring a bell and some silly (yet clever) bits of campy humor. Regardless of all the nit-pickings you can do with some of the film's drastic flaws, you'll have to admit: Indy's back and your happy to see him again. I most certainly am, and no flaw nor slip-up can ever ruin that.There's been a lot of buzz about this movie for years, and any Indy fan is bound to take part in the hype. And once again, as in any movie with the name George Lucas in it, the hype is huge. Huge, in fact, that at least something, anything, is bound to disappoint. And, true enough, fans approached INDY 4 with great expectations and came out with a mixed emotions. But when someone, apparently everyone, argued that the film is too silly for them. I say, what were you expecting? How could a film like INDIANA JONES not be at least silly, but in a good way? Sure enough it was a much sillier, more comedic tone than its predecessors (Not as break-neck as RAIDERS, as dark as TEMPLE OF DOOM nor even at least like THE LAST CRUSADE), but I still say CRYSTAL SKULL, despite a few flaws that are all too easy to overlook, is terrific entertainment, at least taken on its own warrant. You may need to suspend your disbelief for quite a bit, but the film (okay, I know not everyone is going to agree with me here, but I'll say it anyway) won't insult your intelligence. This is a summer movie, right? Indy's new adventure may be a bit of a stretch from his previous adventures, but it doesn't fall too far astray. This new adventure still manages to live up to his previous adventures. The film opens with a now older Indiana Jones (still played with charisma by Harrison Ford, also older) and his sidekick (Ray Winstone) pulled out of a car by big, mean Russian comrades including a bold, witless Russian broad-on-uniform Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, in fine form) who needs Indy to find a mysterious artifact, mummies to be precise. So, you ask, what would Russians want with mummies? Who cares? Indy leads them to it and beats the Russians up, in one of the film's earlier sequences that remind us why we went to this movie in the first place. But that's just a start, which eventually leads to another... and another... and another, with Indy re-teaming up with old-flame Marion (Karen Allen) and teams up with a 50's cool biker sidekick (Shia LaBeouf) in one adventure after another, and it doesn't seem to stop. This movie may be shapeless, but old-fashioned adventures like this aren't meant to form any form of shape or even a story. It's just goes on like roller-coaster ride that just won't stop until the screen fades to black.INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is not just about as fun as it should have been, it's a lot more fun in fact. It may not be the best movie of the summer, but it's ill-equipped with enough action and adventure to live up to its billing. It's silly to be sure, but ain't it all the film came to be? Rating: ***** out of 5.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
156,one9eighty,The death of an adventurer,5,9 August 2017,"Steven Spielberg is back as director, with a George Lucas story and a John Williams score. Harrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones, Karen Allen is back as Marion Ravenwood, other stars to feature include John Hurt, Cate Blanchett, Shia LeBouf and Ray Winstone. It's the era of the cold war, the Russian's replace the Nazi's as the main threat. When a young man brings Indiana a coded message from Harold Oxley he sets forth on an epic adventure to rescue him and uncover the truth about the crystal skull, an ancient myth and treasure. Indiana Jones fans have been waiting almost 20 years for this film and unfortunately most fans were extremely let down by it. Not much has changed for Indiana which was sorely needed as film goers have grown and become more intelligent. The story is extremely far fetched and the delivery at times is wet and almost camp. It's almost like this is a tongue in cheek parody of the Indiana Jones films which came before it. It feels like this was a retirement pay check for a lot of the senior crew and cast, and a last ditch attempt for younger turns to make a name for themselves. Maybe I'm too old, maybe this film is aimed at a really young and juvenile audience rather than somebody who grew up watching these films. Perhaps the intention was to spawn a video game from this because with the blocks of action that there is, I'm sure it could easily be translated into different levels of a platform adventure game. This, for me, and evidently a lot of others, is the worst Indiana Jones film to date. Where as with the other films, if I got a chance to watch them I'd jump at it, with this one I'd happily keep walking and not bother. Too much CGI and green screen, far fetched action (casing point being that stupid Tarzan scene - you!). I honestly could keep rolling with the negatives but I feel I should force myself to stop writing and just say that the previous films are much better and I'd happily forget that this was made. For God's sake please don't let there be a spin off with Shia LeBouf as the new Henry Jones the 3rd because that's what it felt like this was building up for, just let the dead rest because this seems to have practically killed off the franchise. I'm giving it a 5 out of 10, is this was the only Indiana Jones film it would be harmless to watch, but knowing what has come before I just couldn't buy into and enjoy this. Good luck!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
157,educallejero,And another one...,5,25 July 2020,"Finally the last one of these. It's ok. As good as the other ones, but with an older protagonist. The action is better, but that's mostly because of the technology. It's all pretty much the same, with the ""Indiana tone"" that mixes violence and boring and serious exposition, with cartoony violence and gags.Some good jokes here and there; acceptable space for the amazing Cate Blanchett to be a russian villain; and overall good pace (although the first hour is a bit slow).It could be better than the other ones, but it fails in my opinion, to showcase the personal relationships. It just doesn't make sense who does what and with whom Indiana spends more of the time, considering how the movie ends. Some roles should've been reversed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
158,Stampsfightclub,"Wasn't going to live up to the others, but...",8,3 June 2008,"After much hype and anticipation, Harrison Ford (Blade Runner) puts the hat back on to reprise his role as the best archaeologist to ever grace our screens in Steven Spielberg's action adventure. It's the 1950s and Indiana Jones and young cheeky Mutt are trying to solve the mystery surrounding a powerful crystal skull.Possibly the most anticipated sequel for years, the forth instalment of the franchise is exciting and tense, though it doesn't live up to the classics, which was always likely to be the case.After the opening car driving scene and seeing Jones in a more fragile light, I dreaded the worst. However as we get to see more of Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth) as villain Spalko and a good performance by Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) as Mutt does the film liven up and become tense and almost reminiscent of the previous 3. However it never matches that level, there was just something about the previous 3 that made them so great.Ford I'm unfortunate to say is on poor form, and I really like him but this portrayal he gives as a withered but yet clever old man never comes off and it's such a shame as he made the role so iconic in the 80's.The plot is far from brilliant and direction is inconsistent from Spielberg. However the situations, action sequences and general likability about all the characters makes it a good watch. The sword fight scene in the Amazon is amazing, truly the best bit of the film.Ray Winstone has an intriguing part to play but his character could have done with a bit more on screen time to generate the depth between him and Jones.I've never been a fan of CGI as it doesn't generate realism, which is the case here.There are a few scenes which I found very bizarre; none more so than the last couple of situations. The use of deadly animals is never lost and with snakes, monkeys and ants do we get that creepy feeling down our spines like no other film can do.Despite a poor script and not matching the others, the action sequences, the characters and the performances still make it a good 2 hour watch.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
159,fwomp,Do We Really Need Bigger And Better ...And Aliens?,6,24 May 2008,"Although able to spark a significant INDIANA JONES sense of nostalgia, and add a possible newcomer to the ranks of what might be future Indiana Jones films, there's not much else to Spielberg's latest adventure film ...except an ending that hearkens back to the not-so-good ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE film.Understandably Spielberg was waiting for the perfect script, but Harrison Ford wasn't getting any younger, so it is my assumption that Spielberg took the leap and decided to direct a so-so film rather than let Ford's character forever fall into obscurity. The film itself isn't necessarily so-so, but the concept and ending are not, shall we say, in keeping with the Indiana Jones film mentality.Although I'm no Harrison Ford fan, I did enjoy his early work on such films as STAR WARS, BLADE RUNNER and American GRAFFITI. His later work became mundane and unexceptional, myself only being able to see Harrison Ford playing Harrison Ford and not the character(s) I was supposed to see. But the Indian Jones series was an entirely different ball-game. Funny. Action-packed. Historically ...strange. And just fun to watch. These are the things that make for entertaining cinema. And although this fourth installment in the Indiana Jones films carries many of those items, it does not carry it all the way to its newfound ending.And speaking of newfound, Shia LaBeouf (A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS) as Mutt Williams, Indiana's spawn and possible successor, was a very good idea. He's cocky, strangely funny, and enough not like Indy to make the character believable. The sword fights on top of careening cars as they travel through the jungle and disrupt his testicular fortitude were just the right amount of zany action and ridiculous comedy that needed infusing into the story.Nostalgic-wise, the incorporation of Indiana and his love for his hat are immediately taken to heart as we witness him being ripped from the trunk of a car by communists, the main one being Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, THE LORD OF THE RINGS), a sword-carrying and tough spy in the likes of actor Paul Freeman who played Rene Belloq in THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC. Most Indy fans will also be very happy to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion, Indiana Jones' love interest from the first film. Although the years show heavily on Mrs. Allen, she's still spunky enough to give a fine performance.Lovers of the original soundtrack will also be happy how it was folded into this latest release, portions of the music being liberally sprinkled throughout the story. The filming used for Indiana Jones 4 did not use digital cameras, so the original style can also be seen and felt by the viewing audience.Where the story begins to crumble, however, is in the storyline that reuses old themes from the Raiders film (anyone who looks at or knows what they shouldn't is wiped off the planet), and adds Spielberg's heavy-handed sense of science fiction that helped destroy the end of the aforementioned Artificial Intelligence movie (""It's a portal to another realm!"") The crystal skull(s) also just seemed like a key to a puzzle that easily could've been solved by anyone, not just the supposedly adept Jones (and his new prodigy). Which makes the ""alien"" ending seem all the more ludicrous.My assumption is that Hollywood and Spielberg himself think that audiences need something bigger, better, and more spectacular than the last. That's not necessarily true, especially when dealing with nostalgic cinema the likes of Indiana Jones. Audiences will come because they want that old timey feel, not something bigger, better, and more ""alien"" than before.Regardless of this film's failings, it is entertaining. The action is practically nonstop throughout its 124 minute length, making it seem shorter than it actually was. That's something, I guess.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

161,Bob-45,A lot better than I had been led to believe,7,12 June 2013,"While initially rather sluggishly paced and rife with the same kind of continuity errors that marred ""Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade"" (though none nearly as serious), ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" also do not possess the (Gasp!) silly implausibility of the last 15 minutes of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" I find the criticism of the ending of ""Crystal Skull"" more telling of the ""cherry picking"" of those grounded in Judeo-Christian dogma, who can fully accept the supernatural elements of ""Raiders"" and ""Last Crusade"", yet totally ignore passages from Genesis, the Book of Enoch and Ezekiel. After a rather slow start, ""Crystal Skull"" progresses nicely, albeit with a few unnecessary continuity errors involving insect stings and broken noses.Some of the CGI was also less than stellar and it seems Indy sometimes gets lost amongst his myriad of co-stars.

162,jon.h.ochiai,What Happened Here?,8,1 June 2008,"After misjudging a swing with his trusty whip Indy crashes through the windshield of the Russian truck, and says, ""Damn, I thought that was closer..."" The older Indiana Jones has obviously lost a step or two. This is not unlike most of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""it has lost a couple steps. ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a largely entertaining thrill ride, but has a resoundingly stupid story. Granted a coherent story is not the primary draw of ""Indiana Jones""; however, at a certain point this becomes blatantly distracting. Harrison Ford is great as the more senior Dr. Jones, and he looks great. He valiantly performs most of the action with a sense of humor that he is not what he was. Ford should have taken a cue from Stallone, and gone with the HGH. Shia LaBeouf plays the young Mutt Williams, and obvious heir apparent to the franchise. Unfortunately, LaBeouf is literally introduced in Brando-like manner, but sans the innate charisma. Even Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood, the love of Indy's life. Oscar Winner Cate Blanchett plays Agent Irina Spalko, the two-dimensional Soviet psychic researcher who is obsessed with finding the legendary Crystal Skull.As rapid paced and kinetic ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is, it is ultimately buried by its inane story line involving the Ancient Astronauts mythology. This is puzzling given that Spielberg and Lucas are the creative forces or maybe that is the answer to the puzzle. Their credits include ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"" and the ""Star Wars"" sagas. David Koepp wrote the screenplay from the story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson. Their story starts out with the kidnapped Indy leading Irina's (Blanchett) crew to an artifact in a familiar storage warehousea great homage. We soon get the clue that this is an Area 51 artifact of sorts.Fortunately, Indy manages a heroic escape, but soon falls in to the conspiracy abyss with the U.S. Government. His tenure at the University is jeopardized and is forced on temporary sabbatical. Mutt (LaBeouf) finds Indy. His mother had implored Mutt to enroll Dr. Jones into locating the Crystal Skull, which legend says the possessor would have ultimate power. Of course this is only a legend. The chase is on. Clues lead Indy and Mutt on the trail to South America with Irina on their tails.The adventure and chases in the Amazon jungle and ancient temples are exciting, but lack any kind of emotional resonance or dramatic immediacy. Director Spielberg admirably navigates this narrative kludge. However, even the whirl wind pacing and stunning visuals can not conquer the vague endgame. What ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" glaringly lacks is a great villain. That powerful villain is not Irina. Blanchett does her best to salvage her character, but she handcuffed by the script. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" does not work, because there is no great battle of good against powerful evil with the future of the world weighing in the balance. That was what made particularly the first and third movies special. Here we have a half baked story with great action and special effects without a great hero story. And that is a shame.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" will make millions of dollars and further a sequel. What is disappointing is that the movie seems symptomatic of a great movie, but is void of the hero's soul. Entertaining as it is, there is no compelling storytelling. I think we expected more from Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Real stunt men doing real stunts my ass! That car duel was an obvious CGI throw together. The whole thing felt like they stole someone's fan fiction and blew it up to summer time proportions. It took them 19 years to make this? What the Hell were they thinking? They should be ashamed of themselves. It was bad enough George Lucas had to ruin Star Wars - look for references to that as well in the film - now he's disgraced his other legacy, Indiana Jones, and it seems Harrison Ford's as much to blame because apparently he was the one who really pushed for it. They say when Steven Spielberg did Last Crusade back in 1989, he really intended to make it the last one, hence the whole Indy riding off into the sunset, a farewell to Indy and the treasure hunter movies of the 1930s bygone years that inspired him, but for years he & Lucas & Ford were questioned ""When are you gonna make another Indiana Jones movie?"" And reportedly it was Ford, who looked tired and hung over for most of the film, who really wanted to do another one because he missed the character. Well, he couldn't have asked for a worse excuse, even his defense for the film's existence - ""It's a celebration of the movies"" - was lame. Not to mention Spielberg's abilities as a director seem to have waned, and George Lucas, well, he's just a basket case these days. Seems Ford & Spielberg have been hanging out with him too long. I'm not sure which is worse, that it's so bad, that it made so much money at the box office, or that my parents actually liked it. Not only were they surprised that I didn't see it in theaters, they were surprised that I didn't like it when it was over. My mother literally said ""It's a best of!"" My response to her and my father: ""What is wrong with the two of you?"" I have more than my share of guilty pleasure films, but this was ridiculous. Skull is the Indiana Jones equivalent of a Star Wars prequel - a cheap cash in that whores out the nostalgia that's built up around the franchise and doesn't even do it well. I don't expect life altering religious experiences from an Indiana Jones movie, but I expect better than this Crystal Skull crap.Another prime example of why you don't wait nearly 20 years to make a sequel.And now we may have to contend with a Ghostbusters 3.

But it's undeniably creaky. What first made the series so fresh and amusing was its lightness of touch and its tongue-in-cheek 'ripping yarns' spirit. That hasn't quite disappeared, but there is an awful lot of long-winded explanations of myths, legends and hieroglyphics. Thus, between a series of stunt-driven set pieces, many of them implausibly linked, the film gets bogged down in wearying talk.

165,cultfilmfan,Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull,10,24 May 2008,"Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is the fourth entry in the popular Indiana Jones series. Harrison Ford returns as Indy, and the film takes place in the 1950's where Indiana is trying to return an ancient artifact back to it's original home and in the meantime trying to keep it out of the hands of the evil group who wants it for their own purposes. Indiana is joined on his journey by a young man named Mutt and is reunited with Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen) of the first Indiana film entitled Raiders Of The Lost Ark. This fourth installment works well because of Harrison Ford's classic return as Indy and everything that made him memorable in the original films is back in this one as well. Slightly older however, but still with a lot of fighting spirit. The supporting performances are also well done and are acted to the style and feel of the film that is appropriate. The film also like the others features thrilling stunts, entertaining action and enough creepy crawly creatures and claustrophobic and atmospheric tombs and caves to give it it's signature look. I was never all that huge a fan of the original films, but perhaps because of how well I enjoyed this addition to the series, I should maybe re watch some of the originals sometime. Regarding this film I think it's a worthy addition to the series and from what I remember of the originals, there is enough here to keep fans pleased and draw in praise for newcomers to the series as well. Because of the spunky performances, great look and thrilling action packed story this film works well as an action film and is another good start to this summer's movie selection. While this may not be an Oscar type film it will go down as a classic and because of the entertainment factor it is sure to please people going in to see it for one purpose alone: to be entertained and this film surely delivers on that promise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
166,Hollywood_Yoda,Holy Toledo....,5,20 August 2016,"I'm a big fan of the Indiana Jones franchise, but after this entry, I have to wonder if there's a future. The acting wasn't the best, subpar at most. And the story was more outlandish than all the others combined, even counting the Young Indy chronicles. The choice of Shia LaBeouf as Indy's son wasn't the best, as LaBeouf had not had much training or film experience, outside Disneys Even Stevens and Holes. Harrison Ford's role really felt phoned in, not his best either.I really looked forward to this fourth installment, directed by Steven Spielberg (who directed the first three), but I felt he could've directed better. It really seemed like this film was rushed for purposes of making money instead of making a great film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
167,ivo-cobra8,"A good Indiana Jones film not as good as the trilogy, but still a good fourth installment sequel",7,16 October 2015,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) isn't a bad film -- there are a few dazzling sequences, and a couple of good performances -- but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies even tough is a bad sequel but it is still good in my opinion. Yes I like this film it isn't greatest film of all time, but for 2008 film? Yes I will take it. Yes the film has more mistakes and flaws but what ever. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will may not be the greatest film of all time, or bad ass like Riders and The Last Crusade but it is still a good film, it is the weakest entry but still a worthy sequel. I love all the tree films and I like this one a lot. STEVEN SPIELBERG and GEORGE LUCAS bring you the greatest adventurer of all time in ""a nonstop thrill ride"" (Richard Corliss, TIME) that's packed with ""sensational, awe-inspiring spectacles"" (Roger Ebert, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull finds Indy (Harrison Ford) trying to outrace a brilliant and beautiful agent (Cate Blanchett) for the mystical, all-powerful crystal skull of Akator. Teaming up with a rebellious young biker (Shia LaBeouf) and his spirited original love Marion (Karen Allen), Indy takes you on an action-packed adventure in the exciting tradition of the classic Indiana Jones movies!In regards to the ""nuking the fridge"" scene, the thing about Indiana Jones is that there are not some good things in all of the previous three Indy films, especially Temple of Doom, so it's not fair to criticize Crystal Skull for having aliens or the fridge nuke scene without also acknowledging all the dumb stuff in the original trilogy, such as Indy either flying off a cliff on a tank and walking away from it without a scratch, or dropping out of a plane on a rubber raft and sliding down a mountain slope without sustaining any whiplash. Obviously, Spielberg and Lucas were inspired by the James Bond books by Ian Fleming, where the main character always escapes near-death situations.As far the ""aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie"" argument goes, Indiana Jones has always been about fantasy and science fiction. I mean, Indy has dealt with ghosts that come out of an ark and spontaneously melt people's faces, voodoo dolls, beating hearts being ripped out of chests through use of magic, and a seemingly immortal knight from the 12th century guarding the Holy Grail, but it's not OK to have aliens?Also, everyone seems to forget what the Indiana Jones franchise was originally about in the first place; it was created as a tribute to old b-movies and adventure serials. This is defiantly my least favorite out of all of the Indy films but its still a lot of fun even though the cgi was kind of bad and although I was kind of interested in the whole alien I thought the ending was kind a stupid when they show the flying saucer but overall I really like it.Famed archaeologist/adventurer Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a 2008 American science fiction adventure film. The rating I give to this film is 7.5/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film claiming this isn't at least a GOOD action film (it is sure as hell better than all the comic movies that get high scores) needs their head examined. 7.5/10 Grade: B+",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
168,petra_ste,Temple of Doom can breathe a sigh of relief...,4,22 May 2008,"...as, from today, it's no longer the worst Indiana Jones film. I've never been a big fan of Doom but, compared to this, it feels like cinematic gold.In spite of a decent first act and a charismatic turn by Ford, Kingdom of the Crystall Skull reeks of desperation and sadness in the same way the Star Wars prequels did. If the first twenty minutes are breezy Spielberg entertainment, the rest is Lucas at his worst - his fingerprints are all over the movie.Indy 4 is tiresome and clumsy (beginning with the abominable mouthful of the title). There's more fun in the prologue of Raiders than in all the labyrinthine ramblings of the Crystall Skull.The plot unfolds with the grace of a botched seppuku attempt. 1957: an aging Indy hunts for another mystical MacGuffin, along with Marion (Karen Allen), Mutt (Shia LaBoeuf), Mac (Ray Winstone) and Oxley (John Hurt), racing against the Soviets led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). It's sad when Indiana Jones ends up mimicking its own second-rate imitators like Tomb Raider, National Treasure (the decrypting of bogus ""clues"") and The Mummy (the character played by Winstone is a copy of the greedy, double-crossing sidekick seen there).There's much debate about whether action scenes are more implausible than in previous Indy movies. That's not the point, really. The problem is how set-pieces here are MEDIOCRE. Usually Spielberg crafts these scenes with grace and intelligence, an attention to spatial relationships, ""weight"" and consequences. Here most of the action occurring after the first thirty minutes is a bloated mess. Watch the truck scene in Raiders and then the jeep sequence in Skull. The difference couldn't be clearer.Ford acquits himself admirably - the man has been phoning it in for ten years, but give him whip and fedora and he still holds his own. On the other hand Blanchett, who is usually great in everything, is strangely underwhelming as the villain. Her cartoonish portrayal ends up in no man's land, neither menacing nor amusing, neither despicable nor sympathetic. She is just there, with a bad accent.Karen Allen... bless her for not being Kate Capshaw, I guess, but she is awful. In Raiders she was a tough girl who punched Indy in the face and survived out-drinking sherpas. Here she's a soccer mom from hell, batting her eyelids with a smug grin. John Hurt plays a character so silly that I was hoping for an alien to erupt from his chest. Yeah... that's right. They cast John Hurt to play the village idiot.As for the suddenly ubiquitous LaBoeuf... he is not terrible, but his character is annoying: Mutt has the sole purpose of giving teens a younger protagonist to identify with. The creeping suspicion is that Spielberg and Lucas want Mutt to eventually become the new Dr. Jones: what a singularly bad idea. The saga should have ended with the heroes riding away at the end of The Last Crusade.John Williams complies to the general feeling of mediocrity and offers a score whose only pleasures come from the legendary (and disappointingly underused) Indy theme and from nods to previous movies (the themes for the Ark and Henry Jones Senior).4/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
169,The_Movie_Cat,"""What a waste of my time!"" or... ""What exactly am I being accused of, besides surviving a nuclear blast?""",2,7 June 2008,"Wow. At date of writing this has an average of just over 7/10 based on over 61,000 votes.Did they show the wrong film at my cinema or something? I'm a tolerant man, but the second I see someone survive a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge and then get a comedy double take off a CGI beaver (like Roger Moore had never stopped playing 007) is the second I decide I really want to walk out of the cinema.Just... incredible. Like the people responsible wanted to make the worst film they possibly could, drivel upon drivel fills the screen in a disjointed cavalcade of ineptitude. I can't remember the last time I saw a film this bad. Really. I'm not the biggest Indiana Jones fan in the world anyway, finding its somewhat shallow mix of action adventure with an undercurrent of American imperialism a little hard to take. But this? I just..... words fail me. By the time we get to Indiana's son pretending to be Spider-Man, Blanchett's bland Rosa Klebb meeting a transdimensional alien with its own UFO (no, really) and Hurt/Winstone just turning up for the payday then all it really needs is for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to turn up at the end holding up a card to the camera reading ""screw you"".",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
170,rzajac,"Call me a no-taste main-yak, ...",9,3 June 2008,"...but I loved it! I loved the way they touched on the Cold War; it really resonated with me. People seem to be complaining about the illogic of this film; but there's something mythic about Jones. When armed with mythic power, a film can wield narrative consistency to drive home an idea, and can then turn around and flaunt logic and be easily forgiven. Jones is a kind of cinema god that communicates something to us that transcends breeches in plot integrity. ""Tootsie"" (RIP, Sydney Pollack) is perhaps one of the greatest examples of this in a popular comic film.If I have one complaint in in the logic department, it's the scenes where teams of machine gun wielding soldiers are absolutely drenching Indy's car with hot lead and no one gets hit; I sort of rolled my eyes at that point. Spielberg could've been a little more careful there. OK, OK; there were a few ""attacked by gratuitous horde of crazed aboriginals"" scenes that could've been cut.But the rest is magic.I loved the Cold War theme. The word on the street is some (real world) Russians are none too pleased; but I felt the treatment was pretty even-handed. Digs were doled out all 'round; directed at both the reds and the red-baiters.I was deeply moved by the scene in the mock-up suburbia; that's the era I grew up in. That scene said everything we need to know about the MADness of Mutually Assured Destruction.And that's what I like about these flicks. Folks expect ""deep"" movies to remain actively engaging. Somehow, the reverse doesn't seem to be the case; folks don't expect ""escapist"" films to have anything whatsoever to chew on, and I think that's a shame. When you can have both, why not? And ""Crystal Skull"" offers action, good writing, great technique all around, and the usual Indiana Jones modest dose of pathos, high-concept, and intelligence.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
171,fernandoschiavi,The film tries to honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. Has good moments but the problematic script turns it in the worst of the series so far,6,28 June 2020,"19 years after a perfect ending to the trilogy, behold, George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford come together again to produce Indiana Jones' fourth adventure. This time, the film pays honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. The decision was certainly risky, since almost two decades had passed, having to introduce the character, now older and without the same mobility as before, to a new generation, in addition to having to overcome one of the most acclaimed trilogies of cinema at all times.This fourth adventure by the American archaeologist continues to bring good doses of adventure, ingenious scenes and fun to those who follow. In the three Indiana Joness of 1981, 1984 and 1989, the MacGuffins are the treasures: the Ark of the Covenant, the Sankara stones and the Holy Grail, respectively. For the fourth film, Lucas wanted to put ETs in the middle; Ford and Spielberg, not so much. They reached a consensus that it is the translucent skull of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. David Koepp's script follows the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull structure, which is identical to that of Raiders of the Lost Ark: good guys and bad guys fighting for terrain in a race that will only be solved in the final corner. The difference is that in the new cat and mouse game, the Nazis leave and the Soviets enter the full 1950s.The script seeks to fill in the gaps left by Connery (who refused to abandon retirement), Elliott (who died in 1992) and John Rhys-Davies (who overcharged) from creating obvious and unimaginative substitutes: the teacher Oxley, which Hurt is forced to interpret distantly, as if in a trance, for almost the entire film; the dean who appears at the head of Jim Broadbent; and the poorly developed assistant experienced by Ray Winstone. Meanwhile, paling in front of the villains of the original films, Cate Blanchett plays the Russian Irina Spalko in an absolutely caricatural way, never sounding threatening and letting her hairstyle, costume and accent do all the work of ""composing"" the character. On the other hand, it is undeniable that Lucas had a good idea in bringing an impetuous young man as a counterpoint to the aging protagonist, which, in an ideal world, could recapture the wonderful dynamics established by Ford and Connery in ""The Last Crusade"", oscillating only Indiana's stance towards the frowning side of the spectrum - and, in fact, this effort can be seen in the scene in which Mutt, after a bold move, looks with a proud smile at Indy, who returns a sullen expression (exactly as it had happened so many times in the 89 film). Unfortunately, this dynamic appears only punctually throughout the projection, which prefers to spend more time on the repeated (and only occasionally funny) references to the hero's more advanced age. Likewise, Marion's return is disappointing for not rescuing the explosive chemistry seen in Hunters, since everything here seems just an uninspired imitation of what happened in the original: the couple's fights seem forced, as well as the eventual (and inevitable) romance.The irregularity of the script, however, is not only characteristic of the development of the characters. Contrary to what happened in the previous films, the Indiana Jones plot and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not only not interesting, it is also developed in a chaotic way. The plot of the crystal skulls is the worst of the entire series, even surpassing the already claudicating of Sankara stones in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom: you never know what the skulls really are, what they can do, how they came to be here and why there is a need to return them. The story is so absurd that Spielberg, Koepp and Lucas simply have no idea how to end it, culminating in an ending that comes close to catastrophe.If before Indy's missions were explained in a simple and objective way, putting the narrative in motion quickly, here the searches and deductions of the heroes take a long time - and the worst: nevertheless, they do not become clearer. Furthermore, although there is an obvious symbolic Catholic aspect in the presence of 13 aliens (Christ and the apostles), the nature of that temple and the objectives of the creatures are never clear. In fact, the fact is that the plot of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is simply bad - and Lucas's insistence on using it is probably the biggest factor responsible for the failure of this new film, since not even Indy's motivations are explained satisfactorily: why, for example, does he insist so much on ""returning"" the skull as Oxley wishes? And why did Ox, after failing in his first effort to enter the temple, return the artifact to the place where he had found it instead of saving it for later attempts? And why do certain creature (s) act that way at Irina's request? Unfortunately, instead of trying to refine the plot, Koepp tries to disguise the absurdities through ridiculous lines like ""They went back to the space between the spaces"" (in fact, practically everything that John Hurt has to say in this film hurts his ears).Another thing that bothers is the fact that Spielberg sometimes treats the characters as unbeatable. Some of the best scenes in the entire series are forced and exaggerated, like the mine chase in 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' or the classic truck moment in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. These sequences, however, also worked thanks to the reactions of the characters, who were surprised by the facts. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, they seem to be sure they will never be hurt, resulting in moments that are difficult to swallow like the jump of Marion's jeep. There is a limit to common sense. Despite this, the action sequences mostly work. From the start in the car duel in the desert with Soviet soldiers, going through the whole sequence in the warehouse and in the bizarre ghost town (except the refrigerator scene, of course), the motorcycle chase in college, culminating in the forest race, including the falls in the geographically incorrect Iguazu Falls and the revelation of El Dorado, what we see is pure Indiana Jones, albeit with a Steven Spielberg much less inspired by evoking truly unforgettable moments. Again, he exaggerates like the endless sword fight on top of the cars and the dark ""Tarzan moment"" with Mutt in the vines, but, in general, the director gets it right by materializing Koepp's ideas in a harmonic set.However, with the exception of a motorcycle chase in the first act, nothing in this project reminds us of brilliant moments like Indy and the Nazi trucks (in Raiders of the Lost Ark), the chase on the underground tracks (in Temple of Perdition) or the tank fight (in The Last Crusade). Yes, there is a long fight over jeeps in the jungle, but the most that Spielberg can create is a beaten mutt gag being hit between the legs by the local vegetation. In addition, the sequence is orchestrated in a confusing, almost chaotic, bordering on laziness when, after the fight comes to an end, new Russian vehicles appear out of nowhere. In the same way, if the joke involving the tree that hits the communist agents hanging from the rock is even funny, it is sad to realize that, soon after, those same henchmen reappear next to Irina, as if nothing had happened. And why does Spielberg insist on showing agile natives hiding in the temple and other ruins if their nature is never explained clearly and they have no effect on the narrative's development?The production tried to use the maximum of practical and stunt effects to avoid overuse of computer graphics. Despite using many practical effects, a 2008 production could not very easily evade CGI, and here I have it that Spielberg made a premeditated - and ultimately misunderstood - choice to make computer graphics emulate the effects practical that would have been possible, to a certain extent, in the 1980s, bringing an ""old-fashioned"" veneer to the film which, I am the first to say, sometimes seems strange.
Even with all its problems, however, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull works at least as an exercise in nostalgia: it is pleasurable, as a movie buff, to review the Paramount logo turning into a real version that opens the adventure or accompanies the hero's path through the red line on a map. In addition, Spielberg is adept at rescuing all the language of previous films, from the constant travellings that bring us closer to the characters at dramatically relevant moments to the occasional backlight that marks the (here, only supposed) strength of the villains. Likewise, director of photography Janusz Kaminski does an impeccable job in recreating the style of the now retired Douglas Slocombe, recapturing his preference for shadows and silhouettes, for plans that reveal only the characters' eyes and for the elegant sepia tone that gives the film a classic tone that, even beautiful, does not betray the homage to the B productions made by the series. Not to mention another soundtrack by John Williams. How not to shiver with the Indy theme? Revisiting classics and showing that he is still a master at what he does, this trio - Lucas, Spielberg and Ford - proves that the new doesn't always mean the best. In some cases, luckily, the experience still has a lot to say.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

There is a ridiculous female officer in the latter group who is a parody of herself but this whole picture is tongue in cheek comedy. Some quite good spectacular fight and other interesting special effects scenes in the movie, and super film of waterfalls. The script and story is written for children.

174,Rogue-32,Keeping Up With The Joneses,8,23 May 2008,"I was never a huge fan of the Indiana Jones films, although I did like them and appreciate what Spielberg, Lucas, Kaufman and the cast were able to create with these stories. After seeing the new film today, I find myself being even more appreciative of what this crew is able to accomplish, especially in the far more jaded world of 2008.Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a throwback to that kind of movie - a bonafide adventure epic, and when you realize that the original Raiders of the Lost Ark came out in 1981, this new film becomes even more of an achievement. This kind of movie is generally no longer being made because the times have indeed changed, but yet here we have Lucas & Co pulling it off, and let's face it: these are the only guys who could - they're the only ones working today who have the scope, the vision and, even more importantly, the belief that such a film could still BE made in these more 'sophisticated' times.Harrison Ford is their ace in the hole, of course, and age has served this man undeniably well - he used to come across as being sort of arrogant and one dimensional in his previous incarnations as Dr. Henry Jones, I thought, but now he's perfect; he's grown into the role brilliantly, bringing a much wryer sense of humor along for the (incredible) ride - it's his delivery, his face, his attitude which makes this movie work more than any other single outside ingredient. But everyone's good here, especially John Hurt, Nancy Allen and Shia LaBuouf as his family, and Cate Blanchett is once again in excellent form as the 'bad guy', who engages in all sorts of high action shenanigans including a sword fight on a moving vehicle without even getting one hair out of place.

Yes, the plot line and the action sequences are completely preposterous, but when WEREN'T they??? I'm just glad to see him back, and Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood (Williams) with him. Nice that they tipped the hat to both Sean Connery and the late Denholm Elliott, (I would've also appreciated props being shown to John Rhys-Davies as well). Cate Blanchett didn't get enough to do as Irina Spalko, our hissable villainess, but she was so cartoonish that less was definitely more in this case. And Shia LeBeouf, though I'm not a huge fan, does quite well as a new addition to the series (and Indy's heir apparent.) Love it, hate it or somewhere in-between, don't wait for video on this one, folks.

The fourth instalment really smacked of milking the cash cow.Everyone that is familiar with the original trilogy will know exactly what to expect from the Crystal Skull. It's a couple of hours of thrills and spills in the hunt for long lost treasure. It's a tribute to technology, direction, stunt doubles and to Harrison Ford himself that you never really notice that Indiana should really be picking up his pension rather than taking an Amazan adventure. The film is very grainy and really evokes the earlier movie as does the reappearance of Karen Allen as Marion. There is real chemistry between Ford and Allen and that is probably the best part of the movie.Overall the movie is pretty good and if you liked the earlier movies you'll find plenty of enjoyable moments in the latest instalment. The best thing I can say for the film is that it doesn't spoil the earlier trilogy and doesn't leave you dreading another.

I have never had that reaction to a film directed by Steven Spielberg before. Whether I've liked a Spielberg movie or not, I've always been in awe of his film-making craft. ""Has Spielberg lost it?"" I found myself asking.Harrison Ford has not lost it  he's still a star  but he's simply too old for comic book action adventure films. These films are always implausible, but part of what makes them watchable is the youthful beauty and exuberance of the leads. At this stage in his career, Ford should be playing eminence-grise-type characters, that is, powerful older men, rather than goofy action heroes who solve problems by swinging from light fixtures in large warehouses.Shia LaBeouf, as Indy's young sidekick, is no young Harrison Ford. Why this guy landed such a prize role is a mystery. Dressing him in Marlon Brando's ""Wild One"" costume only highlights his lack of charisma and acting talent.There is ""implausible"" and then there is ""implausible."" Good implausible scenes are so audacious that you willingly, and joyfully, surrender your disbelief. There is one scene like that in ""Crystal Skull"" when Indiana Jones (Ford) makes clever use of a refrigerator, which Spielberg makes sure we know is a lead-lined refrigerator. Other than that, though, the special effects are nothing special, and even the thrill of archaeological discovery is dull. You could probably get more jollies watching a Discovery Channel documentary on a real lost city than you'll get from ""Crystal Skull""'s unintriguing Amazonian enclave.Cate Blanchett, a fine actress in her prime, is out of place and underused; ditto John Hurt.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
178,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Passable as a stand alone film. Awful when compared to the original trilogy.,6,10 July 2008,"It seems that trilogies aren't enough these days so the studios push some of their old heroes out of retirement for one last adventure in hopes giving fans another fun ride and for an opportunity to rake in some more cash. John McClane managed to do that quite fine with the thoroughly enjoyable ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" but Indiana Jones's gears have become very rusty and he just doesn't do it the same way anymore.Virtually everything about this movie is a serious downplay from the legendary trilogy that concluded wonderfully in 1989. The plot isn't nearly as engaging. It tries to mix politics and espionage into the adventure formula that will leave fans confused as to what is really important. The stakes are a lot lower here that in the previous films with Indiana only dealing with a handful of bad guys. Even after just seeing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" - one of the best action/adventure movies ever made - and seeing it's hero go through all that an come out on top, a handful of Soviet agents hardly feels threatening. The action scenes are fine, in a sense, and there is a fun car chase through the jungle, but it doesn't at all compare to the previous films' set-pieces. The computer graphics and blue screen effects are so obvious that it is practically an insult to the scenes like the truck chase from ""Raiders,"" mine cart chase from ""Temple"" and the tank chase from ""Crusade."" Even as Indiana explores various caverns and temples in his search for the answer to the film's mystery, that old school feel is gone. The film feels fake, artificial and very forced. The mystery is simply not that interesting and the conclusion isn't any better. The last part of the film is almost all computer graphics. I don't believe that, after seeing the conclusion to ""Crusade,"" they couldn't create a climatic set-piece for this film without avoiding CGI in full.Now I am not trying to lash out against computer graphics, they can be very enjoyable, but they simply are not the feel of Indiana Jones. The worst example in the film would have to be when our legendary hero survives a nuclear blast early on. That scene is pretty much a good indicator of what to expect - cheesy over done effects and a dull clichéd plot. The last scene is especially cheesy.This is all of course in comparison to the original Indiana Jones films which are simply put: superb. So as a stand alone film, this is a passable, if not stellar, adventure story. It is more akin to Stephen Sommers's ""The Mummy"" - a guilty pleasure action movie with lots of effects, but as an addition to the Indiana Jones franchise it is a thorough disappointment. A good indicator as to why this is the case is that George Lucas finally settled on a script after countless rewrites and revisions by different screenwriters and the original Indiana Jones flavor got lost somewhere along the way. I am itching to get a hold of the script that Frank Darabont wrote and which was rejected in 2003.

Harrison Ford plays the part great yet again and honestly the acting is at the very least okay.
The biggest issue being the plot isn't surprising as the skulls are a weird and unfitting plot that needed work in order to work out better. That's not saying it absolutely couldn't work but it just feels contrived that the government is after him to and such.
My biggest issue with the film is the overall lighting of the film as it tries to recapture that style it fails and overexposes half the shots of the film which can get annoying

And so there is no hidden secret that Harrison Ford casted as Dr. Jones back in the early 80ties was and still is one of the most clever castings in cinema history. And during 20th century's most terrible decade director Steven Spielberg gave us an impeccable trilogy of adventure, humor and excitement - and since 1989's the Last Crusade, Spielberg and company has been chit-chatting about a fourth turn, and he really needed 19 years to create it; and over those 19 years Spielberg's smoked 2 Oscars and proved himself as one of the more unpredictable directors in Hollywood. Now, in 2008 he returns to the big-adventure of his favorite franchise - and I read somewhere in an interview with Harrison Ford, that he and all of the rest felt like now was the right time; unfortunately, I can't avoid feeling that it's a bit too late.We're presented with Indy in Nevada in 1957, captured by Russian communists who're in search for an atomic bomb - and to watch Harrison Ford at the age of 65 whopping that whip, beating bad-guys on the nose and wisecracking with some off-note comedy-timing I really had to get used to the sight of Indiana Jones: The Grandpa edition. Nevertheless, Ford IS Indiana Jones, he's just gotten older. And luckily, Spielberg does not sideline Indy for the great cast here; Cate Blanchett as Russian ice-queen looks better than she talks as her one-dimensional role don't get too much do; Ray Winstone and John Hurt falls in the same bag, fine actors getting bones instead of meat; it's a kick watching Karen Allen returning as Marion Ravenwood, looking just as sweet as she did back in Raiders,. But it's Indy's true sidekick that sparkles this up, Shia LeBeouf is excellent as Mutt, he creates a ball together with Ford as the biker-kid drawn out of Marlon Brando's Wild One, leather-jacket, greasy hair and chewing gum.The story is the biggest problem here, David Koepp, Lucas and Spielberg has created a bit of a mess - I was begging for Lawrence Kasdan to return - but no, not only does the story become a bit alienated throughout, but it also struggles to find its peril, whether it's car-chases, man-eating ants, atom bombs or flying saucers the movie never closes in a true peak, though it's surely entertaining and lots of fun. And taking Indy IV to the 50ties makes Spielberg glow this movie in a beautiful 50's look, changing the classic palette from the first three. And although even Harrison Ford is more believable than the romance subplot, this is an incredibly slick film that will change your mood, and you will never stop smiling during its runtime - Spielberg and Lucas may be taking care of business, but they do it with care and involvement, cause after all, it's their baby!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
181,oneloveall,Time to grow up,4,22 May 2008,"Sorry fans, the cynics are going to win this one. I did not go into Crystal Skull expecting the second coming. What I did expect was to feel some semblance of that old Hollywood magic we were so accustomed to in the prior trilogy.Not so with the latest Indiana. There just isn't any drive to this installment. Despite Spielberg and Lucas's blatant formula-following with all of the obligatory giant set-piece action scenes intact, two ingredients which feel sadly missed are heart and soul (despite trying to fulfill those categories late, it only feels more creatively creepy instead).As soon as the film begins it becomes apparent that a time-warped fondness which possess it's creators will forbid the movie to shine in any current way, playing out more like a musty homage then a genuine sequel (which feels no more apparent then throughout Ford's tired, dispirited scowl-possessed demeanor). If anyone dropped the ball though, it seems to be Lucas, whose storytelling credibility has truly eroded to the core. Thanks to his plot guidance this retread becomes completely unnecessary and empty- an opposite of what the well-crafted prequels offered in escapist fare.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
182,jdkraus,"I was impressed with this one, but I still like the first and third the most.",7,29 May 2008,"Like other people, I have grown up watching Indiana Jones. After nineteen years from The Last Crusades' release, Spielberg and Ford go back into action for the fourth installment.Like with most of all his other film's, Spielberg once again proves to be Hollywood's most influential and best director by capturing intense action sequences and hair-raising emotional peaks in the film. Harrison Ford, now in his sixties, still has the strength to be Indy. I can tell he did many of his stunts, which bring back memories of the three other movies. Once again, he's funny, charismatic, and a determined action hero.The rest of the cast is equally as a great as Ford. At first, I found it hard to see Cate Blanchett as a power hungry, sword wielding Russian, but like all the other films I've seen her in, she plays her role well. Shia Lebeowulf wasn't bad either as Ford's new sidekick. It was also nice to see Karen Allen again as the stubborn Marian. John Hurt and Ray Winstone are decent in their parts as well.What I also liked about this Indy was how it was filmed. I'm not sure if it's either from the director of photography or by the use of old cameras, but either way, the movie felt like it was made back in the eighties rather than having the modern-day look from digitized cameras. Even the marvelous visual effects didn't make the film feel new or corny. Yet again, John Williams as proved to be the best score composer ever by creating unforgettable music and adding unique themes to his score that build the intensity for the suspenseful parts, drama to the emotional parts, and the uplifting feel of an Indiana Jones movie.But the one thing I found a bit hokey was the story. I don't want to give it a way, but comparing it to the other Indy films, I feel that it just doesn't fit in comparison to them. I will say that I do like this one better than ""Temple of Doom"", which I found to be very strange. This maybe because I'm used to Indy fighting Nazis in the 1930s like in ""Raiders"" and ""The Last Crusade"". This time, he's in the 1950s against Russians. Then again, it's hard for Indy to go back to the 1930s when the actor who plays him is nearly 20 years older. It's only fair, but not nearly as good.I was impressed with this one, but I still like the first and third the most. 8/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
183,FloatingOpera7,The Last We'll Hear Of Indiana Jones,4,28 May 2008,"Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull (2008): Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Shia LaBeouf, Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone, John Hurt, Jim Broadbent...Director Steven Spielberg, Screenplay by George Lucas...This is the 4th movie in the Indiana Jones franchise. It should not have been made, or should have been made in the 1990's with a better storyline and more ambitious plot. Harrison Ford, ever so much older than fifty, reprises his role as the adventuresome Professor who fights bad guys, saves magical relics and has one hell of an adventure. It is very sad to see Ford, white-haired and clumsy, trying to re-capture the spirit of the character. All he's reduced to now is spewing witty one-line remarks and doing less physical stunts than in the previous three films. The plot: It's the late 1950's, the height of the Cold War, and nuclear testing is being done outside Las Vegas, Nevada. The Soviets are after a great unknown power. Indiana Jones meets up with his ex love interest Marion Ravenswood, and his estranged son. They unlock the mystery of the ancient Peruvian lost city El Dorado. Aliens from outer space helped to shape the Inca civilization and harnessed a great destructive power, this power being in a crystal skull the Soviets are after.Although a few times you get the feeling that this is still Indiana Jones in every way - the whip, the hat, the action hero poses, the jungle, the danger, the action adventure, the music by John Williams, but for the most part this movie feels like it should not have been made at all. The outer space alien storyline is too sensational and too over-the-top even for Indiana Jones which in the past featured religious supernatural artifacts. There is no real depth to this story, no romance, no intelligent script, no passion, no escapism except through the bombardment of specialized computer graphic effects thrown into it. It is an endeavor that was completed only to make money for the summer blockbuster season. It seems to have been been toned down considerably in sophistication and intelligence so that it could appeal to really really young kids who have never really heard of Indiana Jones. It was a farewell to the franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
184,davyd-02237,Not for the Kids Mr Spielberg!,4,30 December 2019,"Given that BBC chose to show this at Christmas and at 1pm and it contains skulls, corpses, bodies coming out of woodwork and volumes of ants the timing wasn't great. The plot has been used before in a series Michael York did which finished somewhere in the Sahara! Having now seen the movie from start to end it is quite disappointing, pity they didn't leave everything alone after the 3rd one. Having seen years earlier the ""Michael York"" series it is pretty easy to work out how this is going to end quite a way before it gets there. theres an interesting sword fight for amusement and this is one of those films that rushes along at breakneck speed until it becomes clear what its all been about. Not worth it Mr Speilberg and you have done better with other projects, this one I think would have been better disregarded and MOST DEFINATELY with an ""age range"" in regard to suitability",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
185,Prichards12345,Indiana Jones And The Crap Crusade,4,24 May 2008,"It's been 19 years since Indiana last crusaded across our screens, and after so long a hiatus it was always going to be difficult to recapture the magic. But this is something of a letdown.Updating the film to the late 50s was a must given Ford's age, and Spielberg throws in the atom bomb, rock and roll, communists and Mccarthy witch hunts to give us a different spin on our favourite action hero. This is somewhat successful, as are the humour and the chase sequences (although the fridge and the Tarzan gag are truly terrible - who on earth thought these were good ideas?). Overall The film lacks the jeopardy and yes, the ingenuity of the earlier films. As to the cast Ford summons up the bookish and impish side of Jones with his usual brilliance, but the physical stuff now looks beyond him. However some of that is passed to his new sidekick Mutt, played by the up and coming Shia Lebouf. On this evidence he's could do good things, holding his own with Harrison. If only the film had continued in this vein.However Cate Blanchett just doesn't cut the mustard as Spalko. ""Stalin's favourite scientist"" has some sort of mind reading ability that never actually works during the film, so duh, dunno what all that was about. She also has a comedy Russian accent much like Alexi Sayle in The Young Ones. At least Sayle's is deliberate.Ray Winstone sticks his face in the frame now and then, but his character is as thin as cardboard. Karen Allen tries hard as Marion, but she's given nothing interesting to do other than nag Jones occasionally. John Hurt pops up later in the movie as a sort of 50s version of Weird Al Yankovic. A great actor is thus traduced. Hope he was well paid.For most of its way the film is reasonably entertaining but never amounts to anything in particular. The central story idea is a complete mistake. It makes no sense at all on any dramatic level, and the final quarter of the film badly muffs things. I have to admit I haven't at a clue what the ending was all about. I thought Indy movies were concerned with ancient artifacts? God I wish they'd made Fate of Atlantis into a movie. That computer game was everything this film isn't.There's also way too much CGI - I thought from the early interviews that George and Steven had abandoned it largely for the old way of doing things. However what we've got here is a mix of styles of film-making, and it doesn't gel very well. Some of the CGI is rubbish and fake looking. The cinematography, is still good, although John Williams' score seems strangely muted. What happened to all those great ""Indy"" moments? It's like a John Williams clone from Star Wars Episode II has turned up for the scoring duties.So, although it has a few good things - it also has many bad. John Hurt really does get saddled with the most unplayable character I've seen in years. Lucas seems to be just too powerful for his own good. There's nobody to say no to him these days. Spielberg hasn't made a really good film since Saving Private Ryan. No change here. By the way, someone posted on here that attacks on Lucas and Spielberg are anti-semitic. Firstly I'm a huge fan of their movies. Secondly, er Lucas is from a methodist background - he's not Jewish!This isn't the Jones film we'd all hoped for. Not quite as bad as some reviews here have it, but disappointing for Lucas and Spielberg. Lucas in particular must take the blame for the awful story. ; and you'd think after 19 years they could get a better script writer than David Koepp. I can't help wondering what Frank Darabont's script was like.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
186,Superunknovvn,"Thou shalt not mess with sacred childhood memories, George Lucas!",6,25 May 2008,"Steven Spielberg should have known, Cate Blanchett should have known, Harrison Ford should have remained in (virtual) retirement, George Lucas should have... well, he should have stopped doing what he has done in the past ten years: ruining beloved movie franchises. Our worst expectations have become true: the fourth Indy is a disappointment.The movie is not completely horrible, but it just cannot keep up with its predecessors. ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is to the Indy-franchise what ""Rise Of The Machines"" was for the Terminator-movies: an unnecessary continuation of a series that has overstayed its welcome.Sure, at first it's great to see Harrison Ford in Indy-gear again. It's cool to see him put on the hat, wipe the whip and... and then you realize, well, that you've seen it all before and better. The fourth Indiana Jones merely repeats the tricks of its predecessors: The Nazis are now Commies, the natives are now Mayas and Indy's relative Sean Connery is now Indy's relative Shia LeBeouf. There are icky insects, corpses that rot in fast motion and ancient temples that collapse soon after some forbidden ritual has been performed there, almost burying our heroes underneath the tatters. Been there, seen that.There's a certain nostalgia to all these things that we've come to love about Indiana Jones-movies and feel-good adventure-flicks of the 80's in general (the diner/library sequence in particular was delightfully reminiscent of the chase sequence in ""Back To The Future""). At the end of the day, however, that couldn't draw the curtain over the fact that Spielberg and Lucas didn't have anything new to tell and were apparently all out of ideas.What's worse is that the storytelling worked nowhere near as well as it did in the previous movies. Where ""The Last Crusade"" was an exciting and quickly-paced scavenger hunt, ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" needs way too much time to explain why exactly we have to go from exotic location A to exotic location B, and why the bad guys would show up there. A lot of the story feels forced, as do many of the supposedly witty lines, and some parts are just genuinely idiotic.Now, the good news is: Harrison Ford is still in remarkably good shape and looks fine in the Indy-costume. Everything else looks worse than before. The CGI (which thankfully is a bit better than in the trailer), but also the general look of the whole movie. I assume that it was done on purpose by Spielberg, but it sucks for the most part. The scenery looks unreal from the get go, which avoids that you really get sucked into the story, unfortunately.All this leads up to ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" having its fair share of lengths. You are getting frustrated when you realize that this movie isn't as good as it should have been, and then you notice that it has overlength as you watch it. That can't be a good thing.While it's not a complete catastrophe - in fact it is a thoroughly entertaining action flick - ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" does stand out as the weakest link in what used to be a flawless franchise so far. Since Lucas had supposedly rejected a lot of scripts because they weren't good enough for him, the mediocrity of this movie is a bit puzzling. On the other hand, it's not a huge surprise, either. These are our childhood memories and everyone involved would have been best advised not to screw with them in the first place. At least Sean Connery stayed out of it. Then again, maybe he could have helped to put some much needed esprit into this half baked affair.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It's a joy to see Harrison Ford back in action and Karen Allen returning. As well as newcomer Shia LaBeouf, Cate Blanchett as the villain and John Hurt. It's got a good cast with lots of newcomers whilst also sticking to the old formula.The plot is very weird and not that good but at least it leads Indy to lots of luscious locations. The CGI is a bit annoying in some scenes and really in your face, but a lot of it is good old practical effects and even though this time it's more ridiculous than in previous instalments (surviving a nuclear bomb in a fridge?!) it's good fun nonetheless.7/10: I'd say give it a watch if you've seen the others and decide for yourself if you like it or not",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
188,Carycomic,"Not as light-hearted as the first three films. And, probably on purpose.",8,24 May 2008,"After all; it's been (give or take) a quarter of a century since... THE LAST CRUSADE! And, Harrison Ford isn't in his forties, anymore. So, George Lucas and David Koepp have wisely set the in-story time a little bit farther ahead, as well.1957, to be precise. The Allies of WWII have gone their separate ways: far left and far right. And, any American who isn't an ultra-conservative super-patriot (like Joe McCarthy) must ""surely"" be a Communist sympathizer! This ""includes"" Indy, himself, after he is kidnapped by KGB commandos. And, then double-crossed by an old intelligence buddy at a top-secret Nevada warehouse, near a nuclear bomb test site.If this movie had remained set in the Never-Never Thirties, Indy would have used his bull-whip moments earlier. And, upon obtaining the machine gun, he wouldn't have even bothered asking questions as he opened fire on the enemy! But, he is almost sixty in this film, and all too aware of his own mortality. Especially, after the deaths of his father and Marcus Brody.The scene where we learn this latter fact, as evidenced by the photographs of Sean Connery and Denholm Elliot, is all the more poignant for those of us old enough to recall that Mr. Elliot really did pass on to the Great Actors' Home-in-the-Sky. The chase scene with Mutt's motorcycle was a hoot. Especially, when I recognized that a lot of it had been filmed at Yale University, in my home state of Connecticut!And, I loved how Indy used his brain, instead of his brawn, in saving Mutt's life from that blowgun-toting capoeirista in the Peruvian graveyard. Instead of snaring the blowgun with his whip (as he might have in his younger days), he slyly follows the would-be assassin and turns the guy's own weapon against him, in a way I have only seen once before. In an old Bugs Bunny cartoon!There are, in fact, quite a few subtle homages throughout this film. When Indy tells Mutt that he shouldn't have brought a knife to a potential gunfight, he is quoting Sean Connery's character from THE UNTOUCHABLES. And, when he later says he has a bad feeling about that Akatorian tomb, there are probably very few movie-goers who don't know he's quoting practically every character in both STAR WARS trilogies.But, it's the climactic escape scene--towards the end of the movie--that might be too subtle for most. It's a slight variation of the escape scene from the s-f movie classic, JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (w/James Mason and Pat Boone)!In short: I salute Messrs. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford for using the ancient-astronaut angle as the maguffin for this film. And, also, for having the courage to show Indy finally realizing his limitations, while simultaneously having enough courage of his own to go on the greatest and most unpredictable adventure of all. Being a husband and father!!! My one-and-only complaint? Indy not allowing Mutt to try on the brown fedora. For that, I deduct two points. ;-)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
189,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,6,6 September 2010,"Fourth installment deals with an older Jones (Ford is old too) battling Soviet agents while trying to uncover the mystery behind the crystal skulls. Mutt Williams (LaBeouf) accompanies Jones to Peru to find answers, including one from Williams' mother who's hiding a painfully obvious and predictable secret. Even after a nineteen year break, Idiana Jones seems tired, while Karen Allen returns to be as annoying as Capshaw was in ""Idiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (instead of being just straight up dull like she was in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). All new characters are far from colorful. Too many sequel clichés to be fully entertained—Jones is a down-and-out has-been (eerily similar to ""Rocky V"" and ""Rocky Balboa"") who reunites with an old love-interest (so old, she's got bigger bags under her eyes than an insomniac) that we didn't know ended so bitterly (kind of like Dewey and Gale from ""Scream 2"" and ""Scream 3""). More annoying than its predictably, corniness and clichés are actions sequences that were cheapened by CGI.

190,DarthVoorhees,Fedoras and whips are in style again...,9,22 May 2008,"I hardly ever have revelations or opinions about a movie until I see it through and reach the end. I found myself dissecting this movie while I was watching it, and I didn't really know why. Raiders was one of the first movies I remember seeing and loving and I desperately wanted Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be something really special. Well mid way through the film I decided I was disappointed with this movie. Here I was going to a midnight show for one of my boyhood heroes and I was treated to another lackluster David Koepp script. The story didn't make much sense, the Russians were predictable villains, and Indy surviving a nuclear blast...Then before I decided I hated it, I thought to myself about what Indiana Jones was really supposed to be, the modern day Buck Rogers serial brought to life. When you think hard none of the other Indiana Jones films had overly outstanding dialogue or stories that made you think. What made the other Indiana Jones films great was the execution of the material and Crystal Skull is able to succeed in this regard as well. I liked Raiders and Last Crusade a great deal because Indy was looking for biblical larger than life artifacts, and I had some trouble digesting the notion of extra terrestrials but not too much trouble because Spielberg is very careful to make sure that the aliens are not presented in an overly over the top way. They are very similar to his aliens from Close Encounters in the fact that they mean peace and try to bring advancement to the civilians.I was a little hesitant towards the idea of having the Soviets as villains. I just thought it was too predictable after using the Nazis twice and because the Soviets really didn't represent the mythical evil that the Nazis did. However Spielberg does touch upon something clever in the beginning of the film, Indy is fired from his university and during a high speed motorcycle chase they pass through anti-soviet propaganda. The idea of having Irina Spalko see only a weapon out of the artifacts skims across the surface of some commentary. I kind of wished they would have played more with that but then again Indiana Jones has never truly been a political commentary, even when he was fighting the Nazis it wasn't, and Spielberg is passionate about spreading Holocaust awareness. Steve if your reading this a Cold War film isn't a bad idea...Film goers rest assured, Harrison Ford fits back into the fedora like he never took it off. He is Indy and that is really the only fair way to describe it. This is probably the one character in film lure that I would only want one actor playing. The catch phrases still have bite and that trademark adventurous and bold attitude is still very much alive in Dr. Jones. However Indy has grown a lot between films. Spielberg shows Indy has been through some changes and we get a feel of what he has been up to in his twenty year absence. I wanted to know what happened to Indy, I just didn't want him to show up with no explanation. We get glimpses into his time during WWII and his on-off again relationship with Marion Ravenwood(""Huge Spoiler"" Shia Labeouf is the new Junior). Brining back Marion was a smart move in my opinion. It'd be far too easy to just throw him another girlfriend to make love to and toss away like James Bond but bringing back Marion proves that Indy is a human as well as a superhero.The special effects were decent but they were also cartoon at times. Spielberg tries very hard to use the authentic stunt work that made us love the action scenes in the other Indy films but he also wants to mix in CGI. I would rather he stick with one course of story telling over the other because mixing them made some of the scenes appear silly and it lead to choppy transitions. By no means is this a huge problem but it is noticeable.The grown-up brain in me probably doesn't want to recommend this film but my heart and my inner child were swept away by John William's Raiders March again...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
191,tomimt,Dr. Jones is back.,8,25 May 2008,"In a way, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, is very different kind of an adventure film than the previous three, but at the same time it also is very similar in its spirit and appearance. See, the world has changed a lot since the Last Crusade: the Nazis are gone and the big enemy waves a red flag with a golden sickle and a hammer.Also Indy is the same and yet different, as now he's not just an adventurer and an archaeologist, he's also a WW2 veteran, who's view of the world might just be a bit more cynical than it used to be. But still he's the same man, who's ready to crack his whip in the spirit of adventure.So this time Indy (Harrison Ford, who else?) must stop the KGB, whose agent Spalko (Cate Blanchett) is after a dangerous artifact, that just might give the Soviet Union an edge in the cold war. This time Indy's sidekick is Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) and his old sweetheart from the Raiders, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Together they try to get to the ancient, lost city of Akator before the soviets.Personally I liked this new installment of Indy series a lot. It has this perfect feeling of escapist adventure and action. In comparison to many new action/adventures this new adventure of Dr. Jones is rather old school, but that is the way I expected it to be. so to sum it up, the actors are great, the scenery is breathtaking and the sense of adventure and action are intact. I can recommend this fully.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
192,DonFishies,"With more work, it could have been the masterpiece we all were waiting for",7,24 May 2008,"There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that the hype for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was high. Not necessarily The Phantom Menace prequel trilogy high, but still rather high. But two days after watching the movie, I am still at a loss for truly being able to express my feelings about the movie. Am I genuinely disappointed, or was I just overhyping myself? I knew it was not going to be far and away the best movie I had ever seen or anticipated, but I think it could have been at least better than it ended up being.Without ruining any of the film (although, not surprisingly, the trailers ruin a good chunk of it), Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is searching for a crystal skull, which may or may not have ties to extraterrestrial beings. The young Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) acts as a sidekick, helping Indy search for the skull, while a group of Russians lead by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), are hot on the trail.It seems from the opening scene of 1950's nostalgia (bringing a certain American Graffiti feel to the picture) that Ford, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas set out to make a movie that fans would appreciate and love just as much as the originals. But in their own adventure to make that film, it looks like they only half baked the final product. The first half whizzes by, and is exactly what one might expect from an Indiana Jones adventure after all these years. The intrigue is there. The chases are there. The deadpan humour is there. The references are there. The adventure is there. Indiana Jones, in all his badass glory, is there. But then, as the second half kicks in along with the point of the crystal skulls, it just devolves into a muddled and confusing mess. I know that the series has never been one to stay in the conventions of reality, but this film really takes the cake for lacking a source of believability.But what is worse is that it seems like no one cares. It seems more like Ford, Spielberg and Lucas got fed up waiting, and just put the film into production hoping no one would notice the story went shifted into autopilot halfway through. Everyone just troops on through the ridiculous setup, and as the film progresses to its eventual finale, it looks like the entire cast just loses interest in what is going on. While everyone starts off the film look exciting and really in character, by the end, even Ford looks like he is bored and waiting for the movie to end. How is one supposed to feel the magic and the glory of a new Indiana Jones film, after a nineteen-year wait since Last Crusade, when the main character looks just as bored as the audience? I can forgive simply mentioning the likes of the Cold War and McCarthyism and then not doing anything with them (along with some fairly ugly CGI), but the majority of the film seems like all setup and no payoff. The Russian bad guys, other than Igor Jijikine's Dovchenko, almost look to be no threat at all. Blanchett has the menace to be a true bad guy and just the right aura of mystery about her motivations, but most of the time she looks like she is just piggybacking off Indiana Jones waiting to figure out her next move. She does not prove to be scary or bad at all. I never once believed, despite the cool sword she carries, that she was going to ever hurt anyone. The role is just too underwritten, and sadly, leaves no room for Blanchett to even attempt to give the character anything.Much the same goes for Ray Winstone's Mac and John Hurt's Professor Oxley. Yes, both have some humorous moments in the film, and do a decent job in the roles. But both are underwritten so badly that taking them out would simply mean finding another way to bridge one point to the next. Even worse is Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood, who does almost nothing. She benefits heavily from being a pre-existing character, but only to a certain point. She has reasons to be in the film (other than what the trailers show us), but only because of those few reasons. I felt the obligatory nostalgic wave when she first shows up, but she really did nothing for me other than being a background character who seems to continually pop up. She still has that chemistry with Ford like she did in Raiders, but her role is never as realized.LaBeouf is actually the one new character who turns out great in the film. Yeah, he seems like a stereotypical 1950's greaser, but his enthusiasm throughout seems to trump nearly everyone else. Anyone who had a problem with his casting will be rather pleased by his performance. I know I was. His chemistry with Ford is great, and other than one scene that nearly ruins the entire film, I think LaBeouf can genuinely be impressed with himself. And no, he is no Jar Jar.Ford, of course, is still packing the same heat he was in the 1980's. From the moment he puts on the hat, we know he's still got what it takes to be Indiana Jones. Even when the film starts collapsing on itself and even Ford looks bored, that little glint in his eye still suggests that timeless character we all remember. His delivery, his body language, his chemistry with LaBeouf and the rest of the cast, is all top notch, and the film is truly one of his best performances in years.Despite its many problems, the film is still a must see simply for being the return of Indiana Jones. I just wish everyone involved put more work into it being memorable.7/10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

So is it the greatest Indy film of them all? Not quite I'm afraid. While it's no Raiders of the Lost Ark but it might well be the second best Indiana Jones film. Spielberg, Lucas, the cast and crew have done what many though impossible: they've resurrected a classic movie hero from a very long sleep.Perhaps the biggest surprise of seeing the film is that Harrison Ford is still believable as Indy even at 65. Sure he's got gray hair but that doesn't mean he still can't be crack a whip or throw a punch like every bit the adventuring academic he was in the films two decades ago. His chemistry with Karen Allen is still there, there's a lot of fun and culture clashing in his scenes with Shia LaBeouf, and he plays well across from the villainous Cate Blanchett, He fun to watch and, like the earlier films, he anchors the fantastic in reality. Ford proves that Indy is like a great wine: he just keeps getting better with age.With Ford is one of the strongest casts ever assembled for a Indiana Jones film. There's Cate Blanchett as the villainous Soviet Colonel Irina Spalko. Blanchett is terrific in the role, which gives her plenty of scenery to chew on with her menacing accent. Karen Allen brings the character of Marion ahead by a couple of decades without losing what made her character so memorable in Raiders: her spunk and attitude. John Hurt seems to have a lot of fun with the character of Indy's former mentor Ox as does Jim Broadbent as Dean Charles Stanforth. Ray Winstone's Mac is a bit of a let down as he is never really fleshed out and doesn't due much else in the film but scream ""Jonesy"" every few minutes. The real heart and soul of the supporting cast in Shia LeBeouf as Mutt Williams. LeBeouf holds his own against Ford, Blanchett, Allen, and others in a role that lets his talents shine. It's a strong supporting cast and one of the best ever assembled for an Indiana Jones film.Outside of the cast, the film has some terrific production values. The 1950's setting worked better then I thought it would with journeys into a nuclear test site for one of the films most original sequences and a look at the culture of the time. The film feels like the 1950's and it feels like a continuation of the original trilogy. That is evident in the script that (like Raiders and Last Crusade), finds a near perfect blend of action, humor, tension, satire, and pacing. The writers and filmmakers find ways of making references to the previous films here and there that add to the experience of bringing not only a new audience into the series for the first time but giving a treat to those who grew up watching the films.Then there's John Williams score. While on might worry about it all being a little too familiar, there's no reason to worry for Williams manages to combine the classic Raiders theme into the score for the film that bring his immense stamp to the film. After all it wouldn't be an Indiana Jones film without the John Williams score now would it? The film does make use of 1950's source music quite a bit and this is a little distracting and annoying. One doesn't come to an Indiana Jones film for the music of the time, one goes for the Williams themes and score. Thankfully Williams score is there for the most part.The main fault with the film is it's reliance on the crystal skull myths. The truth is that yes there are crystal skulls out there and yes some of them are in museums. Those however are fake I'm sorry to say and there's no evidence that they existed before the late 1800's. The film is also guilty of delving way too far into science fiction. That's coming from someone who loves science fiction too.. While I can't go into it much, it's suffice to sum it up like this: this is Indiana Jones not the X Files or Stargate.While it has an over reliance on science fiction elements, Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is far from bad. Sure it might not be Raiders of the Lost Ark, but neither was Temple Of Doom or Last Crusade for that matter. What the film is an action packed, humor filled adventure that's worth every dollar of your ticket. That's what counts in the long run I believe. That and a nice welcome back to Indiana Jones and a hope that there will be another adventure sooner rather then later.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
194,gigan-92,"Indy's Back, But Not As I Good As I'd Hoped",5,16 May 2009,"Kicking off the summer of promising action flicks, we have the long awaited return of Indiana Jones. Still played by good ole Harrison Ford himself thankfully. I loved the old trilogy and to here that Steven Spielberg was still directing and George Lucas was still writing was good news. I of course saw this film on its packed opening day and overall I enjoyed it. This film basically is a modern installment, now with bigger action scenes and CGI. Plus, Shia LaBeouf is excellent in his role I must say. The action is explosive and well-played, bringing us that same feeling of awe and wonder as the old films did.One aspect of the film I found hard to endure, as much as I tried to believe me, was Lucas' overly done screenplay. All throughout it is hinted at this crystal skull is of extraterrestrial origin but I let it go as Lucas was just trying to make it sound mysterious and what not. Egad. As the film reaches its climax, we see a giant flying saucer appear, plus E.T. himself!! This was too much sci-fi for a film like this in my opinion and it kind of killed the rest of the film for me. Plus it seemed too kid-friendly. Not so much as in ""Phantom of the Menace"" obviously, but we have the father, mother, son and 'Grandpa' all together for the climax like it's some kind of family picnic for God's sake. It kind of ruined the solo hero image of Indiana Jones that as a child I'd come to idealize so much. It just didn't feel right. Father and son maybe, as in ""The Last Crusade"", but this film over did it.Fans maybe just a wee bit let down but it's a decent entry. Another sequel? It could work...notice I said could.....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
195,sashank_kini-1,Indy 4 is an eye sore!,4,23 June 2008,"I haven't watched any of the previous Indiana movies. I have heard a lot about it. My father says that they are exceptionally brilliant. Unfortunately, the fourth part doesn't do anything that leaves me in wonder or awe. The movie was a stinker!The only thing that was actually fine was Harrison. He is old but still has the charm to captivate you (normally, you want youngsters to be the lead for action movies). Shia was good too in his role as the over enthusiastic teen who is aggressive yet is the most afraid during some of the scary situations in the movie. Karen was badI mean it, bad. She kept smiling hysterically and looked stupid rather than brave. I kept musing over the fact that she was actually smiling during chaos sequences. Cate was okay, not so vicious as she was supposed to be. The script was badly written. The 'explosion scene' was nicely shot on camera but unnecessary. Towards the end, I was actually fast forwarding so that the movie gets over quickly. The King Kong look-alike tribes looked very mild compared to the former tribes in King Kong. The alien scene was very dumb and I felt to laugh when Cate was chanting funnily something. The special effects were okay, nothing that good.Only the first half of the film was moderate enough to view. After that, it was a torture. The jungle scene was just too much. Too many things were going on and I felt that the actors had suddenly transformed into superheroes.I wish I could give the movie a 5 but it doesn't deserve enough. In fact, its good that I haven't seen the prequels otherwise the ratings could've gone down 4 out of 10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

197,innocuous,Can't help it...got to join the pile-on....,3,1 December 2008,"I just can't let Lucas and Spielberg off the hook on this one. Whether we think they ""owe it"" to IJ fans or not, this film simply has to be judged in the light of their using $185M, some decent talent and resources, and the audience good-will built up by the previous entries in the IJ franchise in making this bomb. It may be better than ""Shark Attack"" (1999, TV) but not by much.Where did they go wrong? Not hard to see, even if you don't want to read all umpteen-zillion other reviews on this site. Two things ruined this movie: bad script and bad CGI.I have a theory about directors, musicians, and authors: They say what they have to say in their first few works, and then they usually go soft in the head. If Lucas really was the one to insist upon the alien storyline for this movie, then he deserves to be publicly shamed. It was a very bad decision and, even if Lucas did not develop the script himself, it was the basis for some extremely silly dialogue and plot. (And, did everyone catch the throwaway lines about how the ancient civilization ruined its environment? Let that be a lesson to you young people.) I have another theory about CGI: Movies provide the SFX that audiences will accept. I was just reading an article about great movie car chases that was linked to by this site. One of the comments posted by a total idiot was to the effect that a car chase in a particular anime feature should be on the list of the top car chases, since there's ""no real difference"" between an animated car chase and a real (practical FX) car chase. I find this depressing. If someone honestly believes that an animated car chase is comparable to, say, the car chase in ""Ronin"", then we are going to get what we deserve...crap. It is my impression that way too many movie-goers are easily impressed by new and novel ideas in staging SFX scenes, but don't really care if the scenes are realistic. (And don't argue with me about whether the car chase in ""Ronin"" is realistic or not. If you can't see the difference between it and a CGI car chase, then you really are too far gone to be reachable through any intelligent discussion.) But the point here is that Lucas and Spielberg, after basically promising fans that they would avoid CGI whenever possible, just take the lazy and unconvincing path of least resistance. The perils seem fake, and so we don't care about them.As far as the other aspects of the film, they basically all suck as well. Here's my miscellaneous comments section: They're not gophers and they're not groundhogs...they're prairie dogs, for God's sake. It appears that 80% of the reviewers here need to go to a zoo or museum every so often.Yes, lead-lined refrigerators DO exist, but they don't look anything like the one in this film. Let's not even worry about the Wile E. Coyote aspects of getting blown up while hiding in one.Ford does pretty well in his return and does not really seem out of place. Allen makes me think of Margot Kidder...are they both just waiting for the men with the nets to come for them? LaBeouf is surprisingly non-irritating in his role as Mutt..I actually liked him. Hurt and Winstone are throwaways. Blanchett just never develops enough personality for you to become concerned about what she might do.OK...that's enough. This might be acceptable on some basic level as an adventure film, but (as stated above) when you have the money, franchise, and resources to do a good job, you're expected to do at least a little better than ""acceptable."" Not recommended for fans of IJ.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
198,griffolyon12,The Man in the Hat is Back After 19 Years!,10,22 May 2008,"This is the movie I have been waiting for all of my life, ever since I first discovered Indy at the age of three years old I had always wondered whether or not there was going to be another Indy film. Then a few years ago rumors began floating around about a fourth Indy adventure, but I still felt that it was a long shot of it actually ever happening. Nothing really seemed to develop though until about a year and a half ago when the fourth Indy film was finally, officially announced; fans rejoiced everywhere, including me. Now the day has finally come and gone, and Indy 4 (more appropriately titled Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) has been unleashed on the legions of awaiting fans around the world, and the question on everyone's lips is after nineteen years, can Indy still crack the whip just as good and create great movie magic? The answer is yes, Indy 4 is a true Indy film at heart, and just like Spielberg said, this movie was noticeably made for the fans.The film begins at a remote US military base in the middle of the desert. Indy has been kidnapped by Russians, led by their evil leader Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), to help them find a crate within the familiar military base. By sheer luck, like always, Indy manages to escape, but in doing so he narrowly survives a nuclear blast. Upon returning to Marshall College, Indy learns that the FBI suspects him of being a Communist and forces the University to fire Indy. As Indy hops on a train to leave town he is met by a young motorcycle riding greaser named Mutt Williams (Shia Labeouf), who tells Indy that one of Indy's old colleagues, Dr. Harold Oxley (John Hurt) who was down in South America searching for the Crystal Skull of Akator, an artifact said in myth that if it is returned to the Temple of Akator it will grant its user great power. While Ox is down in South America he is kidnapped by Russians, led by Spalko, and what is worse is Mutt's mom has been kidnapped as well. Mutt needs Indy's help, and after a close shave with Russian spies on the campus of Marshall College, Indy agrees to help Mutt in his search, and the two jet off to South America in search of the Crystal Skull, Oxley, and Mutt's Mother.This film was a true thrill ride from beginning to end, after a little bit of exposition in the beginning of the film, the film becomes a nonstop roller coaster ride from start to finish. The film was once more superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, and the script by David Koepp, based off of a story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson, was terrific as well; it was truly breathtaking that this crew was able to create another Indy film that so easily slotted in there with the other three, but they were also able to continue to deliver truly fun and energetic action sequences that never slow down one bit, only an Indy movie can pull off a sword fight atop two racing jeeps in the Jungle. All of the crew was great in recapturing the classic feel of Indy once more, such as the special effects, set design, and cinematography, but what truly shines out of the crew work was the score by John Williams. The score was typical Indiana Jones fare, but that is all I really wanted from it, and it is a nice throwback to some of my favorite John Williams scores ever produced. The best thing about Indy 4 though, was the acting. Of course Harrison Ford returned as the man in the hat, and he does his usual terrific job, but as well Karen Allen returned as Marion Ravenwood in this film and did a superb job. The one performance though that really stood out to me was Shia Labeouf as Mutt, Indy's sidekick. Mutt was a fun, and interesting character and Shia did the role extremely well, making him one of my favorite Indy sidekicks, besides maybe Short Round. The other cast players were terrific too; Cate Blanchett was a superb villain as the Russian Irina Spalko, Jim Broadbent was great as Indy' Dean at Marshall, John Hurt was funny and terrific as the insane Dr. Oxley, and Ray Winstone was as usual great as the triple crossing Mac.Overall there isn't much bad to say about this film, this film managed to be fun, entertaining, and funny without ever becoming corny. The only parts that were maybe pushing it is when Mutt swings on the vines with monkeys, but that is really the only part that pushed. Other scenes such as the snake scene were just flat-out hilarious and a blast to watch. As I mentioned earlier the action is superb once more, in particular the Jungle Chase, it was nearly as good as the famous truck scene at the end of Raiders.*SPOILER*Now many may be wondering about the whole alien aspect of the movie, and while many may not like Indy's new direction it has gone in, I must say that I dig it.*SPOILER* Overall Indy 4 is another great Indiana Jones adventure that is sure to please many fans, and stands proudly alongside the first three.I give Indy 4 a perfect 10 out of 10!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
199,rajdoctor,Indiana Jones & Crystal Skull,7,3 June 2008,"I was very eager to see Indiana Jones' latest outings  for three reasons, Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford and after 20 years (with new movie making hi-tech techniques)  something bigger and better. Hearing and reading interviews before the movie, I knew that the producer and director have maintained an eighties format and formula  not much digressed from that. Third day  first show, of world premier release, I was there with my colleague Rodin to watch this movie at the beautiful and oldest Pathe Tushinski theatre in Amsterdam.This time on Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is pitched against the Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) of Soviet Russia. The movie begins with a long over-hauled out action sequence near a remotely located nuclear plant on barren lands. Indiana survives and near the college campus meets this young boy Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who is adventurous and reckless. Both travel to Latin America in search of the Kingdom of Crystal skull and are constantly chased by Irina and her troops. There are many actions and comedy sequences that lead the audiences to a finale  where they are face to face with the mystery of Crystal skull and some UFO type object emerging and disintegrating into pieces with our hero observing the whole spectacle standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ruined site.It is not a bad movie, but neither it is very good. It is in line with the tradition of Indiana Jones. I was not so pleased with this idea of making a younger actor join hands with our legendary hero. I hear that Producer George Lucas wants to carry on the Indiana Jones series with this actor. Let's see. The moments of suspense are less hidden because one can expect without doubt what is next to come. There are a lot of chases and actions, but nothing spectacular to some of the earlier Jones movies.Harrison Ford is the heart and soul of this movie. He looks terrific and acts brilliantly too. Age has caught up with him, but he is still convincing enough as the adventurous archaeologist. Cate Blanchett as villainous is okay, and does not get the scope matching the acting talent of hers. Shia LaBeouf  okay, nothing much to say till we see him as Indiana Jones  if at all.I was expecting much greater stuff from Director Steven Spielburg  who has been away from directing since many year (last was Munich in 2004). It seems that he is struggling to find an exciting subject and topic that would immerse him totally into letting his directional juices flow freely.As mentioned earlier, there are no obvious scenes that highlight the use of hi-tech movie making style. Nothing I can remember in particular of this Indiana Jones that will remain with me for years.(Stars 6.75 out of 10)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
200,WriterDave,Where Were the Dinosaurs?,6,25 May 2008,"Nineteen years after the alleged ""Last Crusade,"" producer George Lucas, director Steven Spielberg, and over-the-hill star Harrison Ford reunite for a fourth Indiana Jones film with ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Only in our overly ironic post-modern world could a film like this exist where Spielberg attempts to recapture those magic movie moments he created back in 1981 with the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which was an attempt to re-imagine the classic action-packed serial adventures from the 1930's and 1940's. But can those magic moments ever truly be recreated? Though it stumbles through nostalgia tinted frames, ""Indiana Jones and the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull"" is by no means the disaster that was Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels or the mind-numbing exercise that was last year's ""Transformers."" Those were four dour commercial films coldly designed to evoke feelings of a lost childhood era that were saved only by amazing visual effects. Surely we hope to say more about this film.Indy deserves to be cut a certain level of slack. Many of the complaints swirling around this long-awaited flick (i.e. the screwball dialog, the cornball stunts, and the cheesy effects) were present from the very beginning of the franchise. And lest we forget, a large portion of people were initially appalled by the heart-ripping ""Temple of Doom"" and mildly disappointed with the creaky ""Last Crusade."" Even the holy grail that is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ended with a lame special effects sequence (and one hell of a face melting). Those who love big set driven stunt action complete with one-liners and death defying tumbles will eat this stuff up just like they did the first three films. My major complaints with this fourth film are the cinematography from Janusz Kaminski, who hyper-lights everything to the point of images being washed out or made smeary, and the lazily lame screenplay from David Koepp, which borrows far too liberally from ""X-Files"" era rejected story lines.The cast is hit or miss with Ford about as effective as you would expect at his age, Cate Blanchett acting the crap out of her villain role (and what great fun she has with that Ukrainian accent), Shia LaBeouf (he's no River Phoenix) barely tolerable as a motor-head punk kid, and Karen Allen all fun and smiles, most likely from finally securing a big payday after all these years. The update to the 1950's didn't quite work for me as no amount of Cold War hullabaloo and ""Chariots of the Gods"" style mumbo-jumbo could replace the inherent kick-ass spookiness of Nazis hunting for religious relics. Storywise, Spielberg manages to fit in all of his recurrent child-like obsessions with divorce and aliens, and he playfully recycles his greatest hits not only from the first three films but also from other flicks he's crafted over the years. When the adventure moved to the Amazon rainforest, I half expected a T-Rex to come traipsing through the jungle for a spell.The beginning of this installment is a tepid mess, but once Karen Allen shows up about an hour into the film to reprise her role as Marion Ravenwood, the film picks up tremendous steam. For about thirty minutes or so, ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a rollicking, old-fashioned white-knuckle adventure complete with car chases through a jungle and along the edges of a cliff, sword fights, waterfall drops, and giant killer ants. The kid in me couldn't wipe the smile off my face when once character's face is eaten by the little buggers. It was for these thirty minutes that I completely forgot about ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", whose scenes replayed in my mind for the remainder of this film's run-time. Were those magic movie moments recaptured? No, but they were temporarily forgotten and clumsily intertwined with some mildly entertaining new ones. I guess that's about the best we could've hoped for. Just think, this could've starred Tom Selleck or been directed by Michael Bay.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
201,dr_foreman,"Starts great, ends weak",7,25 May 2008,"It's nice to have Indiana Jones back, even if this is his second-worst movie (after Temple of Doom).I think ""Crystal Skull"" starts off great. The early scenes have tremendous visual wit -- sue me, but I love the prairie dog humor -- and the stunts are suitably spectacular. I don't even mind the atomic bomb testing scene, which so many reviewers seem to hate; I find it quite in keeping with the outrageousness and total lack of realism found throughout the entire Indy series.After the electrifying opening, the film slows down a lot, but not necessarily in a bad way. The character ""bonding"" scenes between Indy and his new sidekick, Mutt, are handled pretty well and deserve gradual, careful development. All the lengthy exposition about the Crystal Skull is less successful, however.Unfortunately, I think the skull is a poor choice for the movie's central artifact. The Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail both have tremendous significance to our culture, but the Crystal Skull has no such cultural resonance. It's just...some weird artifact, and the script does nothing to make it interesting.So, as the movie ambles along, and the Skull becomes more important, things sort of disintegrate in my view. Indeed, the ending of the film seems totally random to me; there's nothing particularly compelling about the skull, about it origins, or about the whole final confrontation with the villains. Everything unfolds in a fairly predictable, special-effects-laden manner; there are no last-minute twists, no real surprises.Fortunately, the final third of the movie is (somewhat) redeemed by Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood. She's always been an extremely charismatic actress, and she makes a great partner for Indy, so her reappearance adds some much-needed fun and emotion to the movie just when the plot begins to go stale.So, in the final analysis, I like this movie -- to an extent. I don't agree with all the snarky film critics who have cracked endless jokes about Harrison Ford's age; I think he does well here, and I've never had any problem with movies about aging heroes (see also Rocky Balboa, Star Trek VI). I also don't quite agree with the fan reviewers who describe this film as some kind of sacrilege produced by former geniuses Lucas and Spielburg. I've never put either filmmaker on some kind of pedestal; they're both hit-or-miss, in my view. This film represents a middling effort for them both, and for Indy.And hey, middling Indiana Jones ain't half bad.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
202,Mr_Sensitive,"I Like It, and I Enjoy It.",8,25 May 2008,"I have never seen any of the previous three of the Indiana Jones franchise so I can’t compare them to any of those and can’t say it is a good installment but all I can say is that it was pretty damn entertaining experience watching Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It was entertaining from the opening credit to almost the very end, I love it and never felt this much fun watching movie in the theatre and I’m not exaggerating my joy. To hardcore fan it might a disappointment or what else I don’t know that, but for me it was fun like hell.The story is great, though I must say full of flaws and believe it or not, not very much original in some scenes. But for most part I’m very impress. It has Russian, fresh eating ants, Area 51, Elvis song, traps door, crystal skull, FBI, betrayer, and so on. And the action is very much very consistence, sadly the story is not, I must say very brief near the end.I’m also impress with the style of the movie that it actually look like it has been film like years back and everything is still very much captivating. And the cast seem to be fitting in brilliantly with their character, I also amaze with Harrison, at his age this is pretty impressive stunt skill. Shia also is great; his character gives us a look of younger Indy. And who could forget Cate as Russian, awesome with that accent.Even with all the praise I’m giving, there are numerous flaws in the story even if you don’t really think of it you will still see it clearly. And some scenes are just too alike of that Predator 2 (alien spaceship) and The Mummy 2 ending (pyramid suck in everything), and all that of Spielberg previous work with aliens stuff. Not much detail was put into the ending.Otherwise this movie is awesome!!!

204,LoneWolfAndCub,Surprised at the amount of negative reviews,8,24 May 2008,"Probably the most anticipated movie in years, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was well worth the wait. Set in the 1950's, Henry ""Indiana"" Jones (Harrison Ford) is having a rough time. Not only is he captured by a group of Russians led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) who need his expertise to find an important crate, but his sidekick, ""Mac"" (Ray Winstone) betrays him. Because of this, he is accused of aiding the enemy and consequently takes a leave of absence and decides to leave for Europe. However, before he departs, Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) informs him that his old colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt) disappeared after discovering a crystal skull in Peru and once again, Indiana is on quest to find another important artifact with a ruthless team of Russians hot on his tail.This fourth entry in the immensely popular Indiana Jones series is not the best, but is still a very well-made movie with some great action set-pieces, an excellent cast, an interesting and witty script and will hopefully urge filmmakers to produce more action films like this. Harrison Ford is still as good as ever as Indy, his age does not change the role, in fact, it actually makes it more interesting and definitely funnier. Cate Blanchett makes a good villain, she is menacing and ruthless. Shia LaBeouf proves he is an actor to watch out for, he constantly picks solid movies and in this is perfect. I'm sure we will be seeing him soon enough in the next Indiana Jones. Returning is the lovely Karen Allen, who reprises her role as Marion Ravenwood (first seen in Raiders of the Lost Ark) and does a damn fine job at it.Steven Spielberg has successfully directed the Indiana Jones series into the new millennium. It is good to see him take the series in new directions as we go from the 30's treasure hunting serials to the 50's sci-fi B movies. Many people will be shocked at the new turn the series has made but more often than not people find it hard to accept change. I thoroughly enjoyed where Spielberg took me in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. One thing that has not changed, however, is the exhilarating action that never fails to take my breath away. From car chases in the jungle, to an army of killer ants and a motorcycle chase in the streets and a school, the unbelievable events are both fun and exciting.Numerous fans will be disappointed but I am a loyal fan of the Indiana Jones series: Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of my favourite movies, Temple of Doom is an underrated and extremely good adventure and The Last Crusade is a fun and light-hearted romp. This deserves its place in the series as a far-fetched, but ultimately satirical and to put it simply, awesome return to form.4/5",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
205,raypdaley182,Indiana Jones & The Truly Awful CGI,2,24 May 2008,"Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear. I have no idea who wrote this script (it turns out it was George Lucas) thinking it was a good idea but it wasn't. This really wasn't the way to bring Indy back. To take all the best ideas from Raiders & claim it's a new script.Have him return to the famous crate warehouse (from the end of Raiders) to find part of the downed spacecraft from Roswell. Bad idea. Have him caught in a town that's part of a nuclear test site. Super bad idea. Also where the movie jumps the shark too as if it hadn't after the Roswell idea.There's no chance in hell that Indy could survive even a 1 megaton nuclear blast by hiding in a lead lined fridge. The thing would have melted, cooking him inside it and our movie is over and done with. You Wish!Nope, you have to meet Mutt (Shia La Beouf) as the Rebel Without A Clue, then get dragged off to Peru to find a skull. This movies 3rd strike comes when Indy blows a poison dart back down a blowpipe at some native. Only trouble there, they only poison the end facing AWAY from the person blowing so that wouldn't have worked.I am glad to see Karen Allen back as Marion (again, from Raiders) & we discover that Mutt is actually called Henry & is Indy's son by Marion (Isn't that a funny Indy Jones in-joke seeing as he called himself Indiana after the family dog and now his own son is just calling himself Mutt! No, I didn't think so either). We are also reintroduced to Indy's fear of snakes (yet again, from Raiders) when Mutt tries to pull him from quicksand by throwing him a snake to hold on to.I like John Hurt as the semi-mad Professor Oxley aka Ox but I don't much care for Ray Winstone's badly typecast British Agent turned Soviet helper Mac McHale (who later claims to be a CIA double agent).The whole getting free inside an army truck then beating up the driver to steal it (done to death in Raiders). Mutt fencing with Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett who is as bad a Russian as Alison Doody was a German) looks pathetically bad & must be a CGI background as it looks truly awful & must have cost all of 10 pence to film. Oh and can anybody say ""stolen from Footloose""?.Did anyone else struggle to believe the Germans (of all people!) would design an amphibious car with a machine gun on it capable of firing into the boat its actually mounted on the front of? No? Good, I'm not the only one then.Likewise Marion's idea of driving off the cliff, hitting the tree that bends so they can drive into the river. Ludicrous, just like the previous scene with the very bad CGI ants. Truly, truly awful. Only to be made even worse by being able to survive drops from 2 different waterfalls (without anyone falling overboard, being swept away or drowning) and then a 3rd but at least they fell out on the 3rd drop.Exactly how Ox got past the warriors without the skull the 1st time? I guess we'll never know. Likewise we'll never know where all the new Russians turned up from who were with Irina at the bottom of the 3rd waterfall as the tree whiplashing back up had killed all the men who were with her.At least with the warriors between Indy and Irina (and the steps he used to get down all gone) there would have been no possible way for her & her men to catch Indy & co up. Or so you think. If they can create Russians out of thin air they can also kill an army of native warriors as easily and do so. I assume it was Mac (as a triple agent?) dropping all the homing trackers that Irina kept finding. I don't think anyone was surprised the alien came back to life after reconnecting with it's skull (possibly the worst idea in the script?) although Indy doing the ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" line from Star Wars was the highlight of the entire movie (which speaks vloumes about how bad it was).Did Mac stealing the jewels remind anyone of else of Bob Hoskin's performance of Smee from Hook? We finally get Ox being lucid (I assume the alien released his mind) & telling us the aliens are ""interdimensional beings"", not ""spacemen"" as Mutt thought. John Hurt must be bored of portals as pathways to other dimensions seeing as his character as a young man went through that in Hell Boy at the start.The aliens circling Irina and sending thoughts into her mind is very similar to the ghosts ending in Raiders. It is VERY difficult to understand why Indy tried to save Mac after he betrayed him so many times in this movie? It's also very stupid that Indy can't see the method Irina & her men used to get down to the bottom of the shaft (or were they at the bottom of a different but completely identical looking shaft?) with some even more truly awful CGI when they reached the top.As for the silver spaceship? That was asking us to suspend disbelief just a little too far for my liking. the film ends with Indy being made assistant dean at his college and marrying Marion (at long last) making for a poor ending to a extremely poor movie.Not recommended, even to the die hard Indy fans.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
206,the-movie-guy,Vintage Indiana Jones,10,21 May 2008,"(Synopsis) Indy's (Harrison Ford) newest adventure begins during the peak of the Cold War in 1957. Indy and his sidekick 'Mac' George McHale (Ray Winstone) have been kidnapped in Mexico by an elite Russian unit led by the ruthless Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). They are taken to a military storage facility in the Nevada desert to find a mysterious box. Indy escapes and returns to Marshall College to begin teaching classes, only to find that the FBI has pressured the college to fire him. As he is leaving the college, Indy meets Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who has a letter for him from Oxley (John Hurt). Oxley and Mutt's mother are in trouble and need Indy's help. Oxley knows where the legendary Crystal Skull of Akator is located, and Indy must get it or they will be killed. Indy and Mutt set out for Peru to find the Crystal Skull. They soon discover that the Russians want the Crystal Skull, because they believe the skull will give them the power to rule the world. Indy and Mutt battle the Russians while searching for the Crystal Skull, and must prevent the skull from falling into their hands.(My Comment) The Crystal Skull is an entertaining movie and vintage Indiana Jones. The storyline has everything in it, with Indy dodging the Russians, poison darts, large carnivorous killer ants, a snake, dry sand pit, waterfalls, and even a nuclear explosion, besides other dangerous and unusual perils. After 19 years, the film brings back our aging hero, Harrison Ford, who is simply amazing as the adventurous archaeologist. I was impressed with the stunt work that Harrison performed in this film. The film kicks into high gear from beginning to end, and you are in for a roller coaster ride that goes by so fast. The film recaptures the magic and flavor of the Indy series, and has everything you could ask for in an Indiana Jones movie. You must suspend belief if you are going to enjoy the movie, because some of the scenes are totally impossible. The audience must remember that during the 1957 era the United States was involved with the Red's scare (McCarthyism), UFO's, and psychic mind power. If you understand the story time frame of the film, then the unusual ending will not make you wonder what in the world was George Lucas thinking. Enjoy the fourth and probably last adventure with Harrison Ford. (Paramount, Run Time 2:04, Rated PG-13) (10/10)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
207,LazySod,Fun stuff,8,11 June 2008,"Years after most must have thought the series ended with The Last Crusade Indiana springs back in action and goes out adventuring in a kingdom connected to a crystal skull. Life has treated Indy well, he's a couple decades older but still a teacher in a University and he's still out to get himself into more trouble than he's able to deal with on his own. Lucky for him he still has a good number of friends, and of course he has his wits, his whip and his trusty hat.It's easy to complain about this ""new"" Indiana Jones. The film touches on the original three but at the same time differs completely. The feel is different, but the story line is more or less the same idea and worked out well enough. It brings new things, and ventures forth on the old things, and IMO that is the best it could have done. It would not have been good to still display Jones as the young jumpy guy that can be dragged behind a car or on the side of a tank and all that. Not that there isn't any stuff like that at all in this film, there is plenty. But it's clear that he's getting old and it is worked out wonderfully.The story line in itself works for me. I heard a lot of negative emotions on it as it wouldn't be ""archaeological"" but I think that is nonsense. All four films are based around a set of stories that are designed to explain a problem that would otherwise be unexplainable and all four are therefore fantasy. This one just a bit different than the others.8 out of 10 whips cracking",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
208,doctorsmoothlove,Indiana Jones and the Overly-Extended Action Sequences,5,12 June 2008,"Nineteen years, or the last time an Indiana Jones film was released. It has been an exorbitantly long time since The Last Crusade. While the original trilogy didn't influence cinematic procedures, it has had great cultural influence. The Indiana Jones series has also influenced other characters such as Lara Croft and Ben Gates. Harrison Ford had agreed to star in five Indiana Jones films, but never did. So when this film was announced, many people, including me, were trembling with anticipation. Given how long it's been since the last installment, expectations grew to unobtainable levels. This is why so many fans have lambasted the film. While some of the criticism is warranted, much of it isn't. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't a terrible film, but it isn't worthy of its pedigree. The movie is set in late 1950's and opens in Nevada where Indiana Jones and George ""Mac"" McHale (played by Ray Winstone) are being coerced by KGB agents into revealing the location of a mysterious item believed to have warfare potential. Jones agrees and guides the Soviets, led by Irina Spalko (played by Cate Blanchett) to the item which is revealed as a ""crystal skull."" Jones attempts to escape but is thwarted when Mac betrays him. Indy does escape and flees to a nuclear testing sight. He survives a practice test. There is a shift forward in time, and Indy is back teaching. He is given a leave of absence following his association with the traitorous McHale and meets a young man called Mutt thereafter. Mutt (played by Shia LeBeouf) informs him of a plot to murder his father Professor Oxley (John Hurt) who is involved with the crystal skull. This leads Indy to South America and the Lost City of Gold. Oh, and he also meets Marion. Of the many blunders the film has to its legacy, the most prominent is its inability to create tension like the first ones did. Particularly, in The Temple of Doom it was uncertain if Indy would break free of the shaman's spell. Of course he did, but it was not obvious. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, it was questionable if Indiana would finally recover the Ark of the Covenant, and so on This effect is missing from this new film. The tension has been replaced with action sequences and one-line gags. Not that other action- adventure films (National Treasure) have also taken this approach, but Indiana Jones has established itself as a serious franchise. There is also a lack of seriousness to Jones and Marion this time. They argue about their past relationship and not about the plot. It's too comfortable, and appears as if they both understand that they will eventually solve the mystery of the Crystal Skull but not right now. This probably is intended to poke fun at their shared old age, but it shouldn't have consumed such significant screen presence. Ford's portrayal of Jones, when he isn't with Marion is reminiscent of his earlier work. Despite his age, Harrison Ford proves that he is still Indiana Jones with his cynical attitude towards Spalko and his devotion to his fedora. The rest of the screenplay is sophomoric and predictable.It's as if Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas didn't just decide to continue the series directly but met for a picnic and one of them said, ""Hey, let's do another Indiana Jones film,"" and the others jump up in agreement. They then rushed it into development like a child awaiting a chance for his turn at Show-and-Tell. All jokes aside, there's real warmth to the film. The younger actors portray their characters with the respect the franchise deserves. Shia LeBeouf, particularly, presents Mutt as a believable young, idealistic man (when he isn't swinging through the trees) with a strong, independent attitude. It's his best performance since Holes. He has finally recreated the realistic performance he had in that film. Blanchett also acted well, and portrayed the American stereotype of Soviet women to perfection. Despite the good acting, which is hampered by a poor screenplay, where Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really loses the appeal of the previous films is its plot progression. While the previous films did require a suspension of disbelief, they did not require a suspension of conceptual concepts of physics. The fight scenes, especially in Raiders are easy to accept. Part of the admiration for Indiana Jones is the endless ability of its leading character. This isn't so with this film. Indiana Jones this time: survives a nuclear blast, exits a moving train once he's seated on it, and survives falling down three waterfalls. This changes his character from an adventurer-hero to a superhero, which is counter to his presentation in the earlier films. Superhero Indiana Jones glides through endless action sequences and stumbles into his destination. The culminating sequence is quite underwhelming and only raises more questions regarding the plot.Another discrepancy is Spielberg's unusually poor direction. There are several continuity errors, the most noteworthy of which occur during the jungle chase scene. There is a vehicle clearing the trees, but two cleared paths are visible. A vehicle also disappears from the screen only to reappear in a later shot. The crystal skull's magnetic power is only applied when it is needed to further the plot. It is once placed near Indy's belt but doesn't affect it. The natives in the graveyard and the temple are not explained sufficiently. What does their presence add to the film? For me, it detracted a little bit. I do, however, admire Spielberg's use of traditional cameras. Though this accentuates the CGI, it does make this film appear to have been made right after the others.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

We all know ""Indy"" is getting old, but that could have worked if the writing had played to that aspect. It didn't and the result shows Indiana Jones trying hard to pull off the fabulous stunts from the original, rather than letting Indy age gracefully. Lots of action certainly, but to no real purpose.It's never really clear why the crystal skull is so important, and the alien connection seems lost in a jumble of dialog that feels ""invading"". John Hurt plays a very convincing ""crazy old professor"", and could have saved some of this outing, but he obviously was relegated to the back seat for this movie. He really should have been given some more substantial dialog.

212,beresfordjd,Appallingly Bad,2,31 January 2010,"How could this be this awful? Directed by Spielberg with a script by a 10 year old. The action sequences are increasingly ludicrous and a good cast is wasted on this rubbish. Why Shia? The Yoof vote I suppose. There is nothing new brought to the Indiana Jones franchise and it sullies the entire enterprise. If this was the only Indiana movie you had seen you would wonder what all the fuss was about. They should never have attempted it . Robert Plant knew what he was doing when he refused to reprise the Led Zeppelin thing. It is rare that you can recreate the original feeling of stuff like this. R.I.P Indiana Jones. John Hurt, Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent, Cate Blanchet must be regretting their attachment to this turkey. The action scenes just go on and on and on ending up making the audience laugh but not in a good way.

But more than that the action was cartoonish which really surprised me with Spielberg at the helm. I mean it really looked fake, kind of like poor King Kong looked. The chase scenes were too long and got boring. No good villain and conclusions that telegraphed themselves from a mile away. The extraterrestial ending was very unsatisfying and dumb. Unlike some people I don't think the acting was bad especially Karen Allen. Harrison Ford didn't even start acting until her character appeared. Shia LeBeouf was okay and John Hurt.

Unfortunately that seems to have been the sole motivation for both the filmmakers and the actors.The entire film feels like going through the motions, with no sense of adventure whatsoever. The CGI kills what little there is in terms of action, and the pathetic attempts at humour do not help either. On top of that, the plot is so riddled with holes that it alienates the audience. Who wants to watch an unmotivated cast get involved in an illogical 'adventure' that insults your intelligence and is clearly written by a dumb or lazy person who wasn't even trying to make it good? Even the very premise is stupid - religions do tend to come to life in Indiana Jones films, but shoving aliens in it comes across as awkward.This is uninspired filmmaking, based on a bad script and a totally misguided conception of what Indiana Jones is. The uninspired often lapses into outright lazy in this film, and that is inexcusable.This is a very bad film and a huge disappointment for all Indy fans.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
215,loganx-2,What Did You Really Expect?,7,11 June 2008,"A fitting end for a fun character. I had pretty low expectations, but in the end was pretty satisfied. Like so many I watched the Indie films religiously growing up (even remember the short lived young Indiana Jones TV show), and after many years the...(read more) appeal of these films is simple, some vaguely historical premise, anonymous bad guys Nazi's, Hindu Death Cults, Communists, etc, and the most unrealistic action sequences ever envisioned by man. The latter gets stretched the most here, atomic bombs, giant waterfalls, and more chase scenes galore. This is an Indie film for the fans and the kids, and it's not likely to win over any detractors or awards. The performances are decent, there's a good dynamic with the actors both new and old, and Harrison Ford, thanks to movie magic, doesn't break a sweat while knocking out Ruskies with one punch(I did like that the punch sound effects have remained consistently ultra loud throughout all films, maybe the loudest punches outside of boxing films). The addition of (spoiler) E.T.s didn't bother me either, Spielbeg and Scientology love them some ancient aliens, but it works here as logically as anything that happened in ""Temple Of Doom"", or previous paranormal tinged adventures. Ther CGI I didn't think was too overbearing, there's some animals that seem unnecessary, but most of the action sequences are old fashioned chases trough Jungles, Colleges, and warehouses, always chases. It was however a fun return, and a good way to end out the series at least until ""Shia LeBeouf and The Conch Of Atlantis"", or whatevers next.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
216,CinematicInceptions,Some classic Indy with modern touches. Exciting adventure and archaeological action.,7,16 November 2014,"This, as with all reboots, is an incredibly debated film, especially considering how much it has to live up to. As much as people who like certain reboots better than the originals like to tell people to just enjoy a movie for what it is, that just doesn't happen. This is for the simple reason that people set expectations for movies. Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade were, and are, renowned as classics meaning that this was hyped up to be a classic to an extent. Usually the reboot is the one that gets slammed like with the newer Star Wars movies, the Hobbit trilogy, and the James Bond movies from actor to actor. (It would be interesting to see how people would react if the reboots had come out before the originals.) Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is no different. Indy has had a tradition created for him and twenty years for the producers and the character is ample time for those traditions to leave. I guess tradition isn't quite the correct word to use here, but essentially, it's a pretty big jump from the 80's to the 2000's and from the 30's to the 50's. I think people were glad that the film still had Spielberg producing with Lucas, Ford playing Indy, Marion making a reappearance, and John Williams reloading his themes. Despite all of that, there is a much more modern feel to this film than the older ones. However this reboot came around at a rather inopportune time since National Treasure 2 came out just a few months before this did and the National Treasure's have kind of been the Indy movies for the next generation. The storyline is a prime example of this blend of classic and modern. There is a lot more changing of scenery in this, whereas Raiders and Temple of Doom had a couple of locations where several scenes took place. The characters are almost always on the move in this one, penetrating ever deeper into the Akator city. The Nazis are the enemy once again and outnumber Jones' pack by quite a large number. They also have resources on their side as we have seen before. Similarly, they are after a mystical object with a questionably legend behind it, and the legend is proved true. Another theme that is repeated is Indy getting past all the traps and reading all the necessary signs to have his prize stolen from him just after getting it. As Belloq says in Raiders, ""Once again Dr. Jones, what was briefly yours is now permanently mine."" This is a nice lead-in to the characters, primarily of course, Indy. He is played by Harrison Ford with the same personality that has previously been seen. He can still get out of almost any fix and has the archaeological knowledge to decipher all of the encryptions and such. Marion is just as feisty as she was in Raiders with a fair amount of adventure skills for her part. The one acute change in her character is that she is a mother to Mutt Williams. Mutt is the element that really modernizes this film, since he is played by a young actor and embodies the spirit of the 50's, which is a lot closer to the personality of today than the 30's thanks to Elvis. A sort of sidekick character comes from Oxley, who is possessed by the skull. This results in a lot of mumbling and stuff like that which could potentially be annoying. The other sidekick that we see is Mac, who is the greedy double crosser of the bunch. He is kind of working for everyone at once in the hope that he can take the money and run when the opportunity arises. The last of the main characters is Irina Spaliko, the first female villain we have seen in this series, unless we can count Elsa. Cate Blanchett plays her quite well, though her character could have been a bit better written. She is quite as combatively potent as any of Indy's previous foes. While we have that element on the table, I'll address the action. It is still predominantly adventure style with a fair amount of gore like in the ant hill scene. The technology has improved so we get some bigger explosions like the one at the nuclear testing site and with the bushwhacker. There is a pretty good swordfight between Mutt and Irina at one point. The tomb Mutt and Indy visit along with the temple of the skull brings us back to the ancient booby traps, tunnels, cobwebs and phobia-inducing critters that we got from the first three. One thing to look out for in respect to the action is the invincibility of the characters. We had a little of this in the originals and it certainly isn't a new concept to action films, but there are a number of times where not even one out of a thousand rounds from a machine gun or projectile thrown by the natives of the Kingdom hits any of the protagonists. Tieing the action and execution, the effects have taken a big step up for the franchise in the past two decades. The gore and such is much more realistic, which allows for more exciting action sequences and generally makes this film seem better executed than the old ones. The rest of the execution is good as well with pretty solid acting and fluid cinematography. So for prospective viewers, it's a good action flick to maybe add to your collection. If you loved the Indy of the 80's, I guess this is worth a try, but could be disappointing if you're especially attached to the stories of the originals.

217,ClaytonDavis,Indiana Jones & the Big Disappointment,5,27 May 2008,"From Steven Spielberg & producer George Lucas comes the fourth installment of the Indiana Jones series, Indiana Jones & the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Harrison Ford reprises his role as the great and daring Dr. Jones who gets called back into action after being brought into a web of deceit and mystery surrounding crystal skulls.Fortunately, the action of Indiana is still there at age 60 and it is great to catch up with him to see what has been going on in his life. In the past years he's lost his father (played by Sean Connery in the last film) and Marcus Brody (played by Denholm Elliot), two pillars in his adventures. Indy seems a little lonelier, a little less ambitious and even more uneven in his characteristics.The storyline from David Koepp doesn't give the audience enough credit. Unless they expect us to be utter morons or just accept the things that are occurring, the story doesn't flow and the action sequences are even more ridiculous. Framing from a 60-year old Indy whipping on to a light into a car or the young Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) becoming Tarzan and swinging from vines onto a moving vehicle, the film is too sloppy to suffice.There are many other things that the film nags at me with, one being the tasteless love story between Indy and his Raiders of the Lost Ark love, Marion Ravenwood. We wanted them together two sequels ago and frankly I could care less anymore. Nothing is ever explained of her disappearance and if anything, it makes Jones seem like a real ""butt-hole"" if it was.The villains are as two-dimensional as they can get especially coming from the multi-talented Cate Blanchett who plays her accent well but no life or rage to her character as we have seen in past foes.The technicalities of the film from the lukewarm art direction or second rate visual effects, (they looked better back in the 80's) the film is no marvel or spectacle. I'll hold my breath for another stab at this franchise as I think they bridge us to that idea at the finale. Indy is a little disappointing but hold fast for some entertainment and action-thrills.**/****",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
218,dfle3,Struggles to reach previous heights of the series,6,30 May 2008,"As a kid I saw the original movie in this series and remember having a great affection for its exhilarating thrills. Still remember some scenes, all those years ago. Have seen all the sequels since, but they haven't really affected me as much. After watching this new instalment, I'm wondering why the makers felt the need to dust off this action hero. If you like ""closure"", perhaps this movie will fulfill that need in you, to some extent. Must admit to having forgotten about Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood from the original movie. She returns.The plot of the movie is classic Indiana Jones territory....mystical archaeological artefacts which are reputed to hold great powers and could change world history if it got in the wrong hands are in danger of getting into ...The Wrong Hands. In the original movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the villains were the Nazis. Here it is the Soviets. When Indy Jones meets up with them, you almost expect him to say ""I hate Soviets!"". He doesn't. Might have given me a chuckle if he did say that. Watch out for the original mystical artefact in the military warehouse...blink and you'll miss it.Cate Blanchett, in suitably wooden ham mode, plays Irina Spalko, Indy's main Soviet nemesis in this movie. One of the aspects of this movie which may please, especially the more middle aged viewer, are the recreation of time and place in the US, in the 1950s, when this movie is set. The Cold War is in full swing, and rock'n'roll is also swinging into gear. Check out the teen gangs of the time too!Did feel that this movie was worth only 2.5 stars out of 5, but based on spectacular scenes after the halfway mark of this movie, I'm bumping it up to 3/5. Those scenes concerned ants and river rapids.The biggest weakness of this movie is the pacing and dialogue. The movie does tend to drag and only later does it get more exciting. The dialogue, as per a Lucas movie, is no better than, say, the Star Wars movies. In fact, some of the dialogue is as clunky as that between Han Solo and Pricess Leia in ""The empire strikes back"", which was another George Lucas movie, as are the Indiana Jones movies. It's a pity a good writer, with a sense of wit, couldn't contribute to make sparks fly between the main characters.Shia LaBeouf plays Mutt Williams, a young adventurer accompanying Indy Jones on his quest for the mystical artefact. Mutt is perhaps the Jar Jar Binks of this movie. If you still find The Fonz, from Happy Days, a really cool and witty character, you may get more out of Mutt than I did.Overall, like a lot of these kinds of Hollywood movies centring around heroes, I'm not sure that it will have a lot of repeat viewing value, but is sort of fun while it lasts. It's probably just an excuse to introduce a new sequel franchise seeing as how Harrison Ford is getting too old for this kind of stuff. Really, without a quantum leap in script and thrills per minute, I think that this may be the last in this series that I'll bother watching.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

220,Al_The_Strange,"""Do svidaniya, Dr. Jones!""",8,3 October 2012,"Nearly twenty years after the last adventure, a sixty-year-old Indiana Jones comes back for one more round. At the very least, he still knows how to kick butt! The film is surprisingly loaded with lengthy and awesome action sequences; the whole middle of the movie is a brilliant sequence as Indy and the gang chase, fight, and explores the jungles of the Amazon all at once! And with a plethora of quality special effects, the film is a sight to behold. Some of the action is quite absurd and unrealistic; it doesn't bother me that much, but it might agitate some viewers.But how does the story hold up? Pretty iffy. It does have many merits; seeing Indy in the 50s offers a lot of interesting insight as he struggles with cultural and political changes (as well as his old age and mortality). The film explores UFO-lore, the paranormal, and ancient history in a fairly solid fashion; I just feel that its delivery falls a little flat. I blame the writing for the most part; the first three films were brilliantly written with the right amount of exposition to explore the historical and cultural backgrounds of a given artifact. In this case the exposition is scattered, and provides very loose connections that don't feel all that cohesive. As far as character development goes, the film does its best to connect the past and the future of the character, and tie things up in a pleasingly sentimental fashion.As a film, it's got plenty of nice photography. Acting is solid; Harrison Ford is still the man after all these years, Karen Allen still plays her role well enough, I like Cate Blanchett as the villain (although I do think her voice and accent are a little forced), John Hurt plays a good crazy guy, and Shia LaBeouf plays his typical type of role for better or for worse. Although some of the dialogue is amusing, I find the writing to be quite weak. Production value is high, and there are way more overloaded special effects than I anticipated. Most sets, props, and costumes are top-notch. Music is not bad.Although I generally agree that this is the weakest film in the series, I enjoy it enough so that individual nitpicks don't bother me that much. I know most viewers really harp on the infamous refrigerator scene, before bashing the actors, the story, and just about everything else. If you really let these things bother you, then you might certainly loathe this film. As for me, I wasn't bothered the same way most others were, so I learned to just sit back and enjoy the ride. As such, I can only recommend it as a rental to interested parties.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Average | Film: Good)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I wasn't really too keen on much of the acting in the movie throughout, it is actually people like LaBeouf who do alright with cast members like Cate Blanchett being wasted in her role. I found the added cast members such as Ray Winstone and John Hurt were OK but never for me became interesting, the whole acting it could be said is dragged down by the direction.Now onto that director Steven Spielberg who returns in not as good shape as before, some parts are just too cringe worthy and at times it can seem like he is trying to bring back too many memories of the past movies. David Koepp's script is not bad but again like Spielberg can be just a little shaky, it too tries too hard to bring back past memories and ends up with some really cheesy lines to boot. One thing I found that was good if not as great as the past movies was the cinematography side of things, Janusz Kaminski has really studied the past films and comes out with a great selection of shots and although sometimes ruined by special effects, still makes it exciting.Now the whole plot of the movie is well done I think, I think because of the directing, writing and parts of the acting this movie is not that good, but still a satisfactory piece. The real entertainment factor, the stuff to draw you in comes in the final half of the movie when things start to pick up, we see a little more action and also we are introduced to a familiar ex lover of Indies whose chemistry with Ford is fantastic and when them two get on the screen it becomes so much better than it was before.I see a lot of Indiana Jones fans getting just a little angry that this was so ridiculous, I mean some of the stunts are a little insane but some say the plot is the same. Well I say to them what the difference between this is and what came before, the Ark of the Covenant, The Holy Grail and a bunch of heart pulling cult members, well it is the heart pullers who come out most rational. The point I'm trying to make here and without spoiling the movie is that this is one that is not exactly realistic but it still isn't any more far fetched than previous plots, sure the ending is well (You will have to see for yourself if you haven't ever seen it) but the whole back story to it all is pretty well made.So after almost two decades away we have him back, gracing the screens and in my opinion I welcome him back with open arms. I know for some fans it is difficult to see Harrison Ford come back and in such a lack of style, but it is still there in spaces and he has fun with the role. Whether we will ever see Harrison Ford again in one of these movies is unknown at the time of this review but I do hope that even if it is not Ford coming back to wear the fedora and whip, we still have someone to replace him who is just as good.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It's fair to say that I have a minimal stake in this franchise. That said, I watched this once and realized I could not remember a single thing about it. I have now watched it a second time, and cannot remember anything about the last half hour of it. Perhaps my brain just shut down after an hour and a half of this nonsense.

225,pfgpowell-1,Not a patch on the earlier numbers,4,22 August 2012,"To be blunt, Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull isn't all that good, although that is, admittedly, comparing it with its two stablemates. Undiscerning blockbuster fans might enjoy it, but the storyline is a confusing, contrived, muddled mess, the film simply lurches from one excuse for exciting 'action' and special effects and Harrison Ford is sadly just a little too long in the tooth to convince as an action hero, even though the script tries to compensate for that by allowing him to be more elderly. Perhaps it was me, but at several points I was very confused as to what was going on - the scene where Indy meets the chap who turns out to be his son had me utterly baffled - and I just couldn't see how the different story strands - Russians invading a top secret Nevada military establishment, aliens in El Dorado and whatever else was served up - were intended to gel. One particular action scene went on for so long - the fight in the jungle scene - that I got rather bored. But the Indiana Jones were a franchise, the first two were entertaining enough and, no doubt, Spielberg was under pressure to come up with another. It's just a shame that he didn't quit on this particular series while he was ahead. Will entertain nine-year-olds perhaps, but otherwise give it a miss and remember Indy when he could still cut the mustard.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

228,socrates99,The equivalent of hitting a Grand Slam at your last at bat,9,27 May 2008,"This movie is such a delicious escape that I was totally taken by surprise. I'd heard early reviewers had panned it, but that clearly has more to do with its ethnic involvement which is so fleeting you'll probably miss it. Some people have always seen film as a propaganda tool in the fight for social prominence and feel the pain any time any non-traditional orientation makes it to the screen. And that's especially true for a series that's had any involvement with the Bible. In this movie at one point the teen heart throb part played by Shia LaBeouf actually says in admiration ""You rode with Pancho Villa?"" and I could just see reviewers like Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune cringe in disgust.The more overwhelming ethnic commentary is about the Soviets and that's mostly Cate Blanchett's task which she carries off with such relish that I was reminded of Daryl Hannah's wonderful take as Elle Driver in Kill Bill 2. She and Harrison Ford both earn every dollar they were probably paid for their participation. But the two things that impressed me the most out of a film full of beautifully realized scenes was the way the CGI was so seamlessly melded with the real footage and the sheer craftsmanship of the action scenes especially.In previous films in this series much of the action was at too frantic a pace for my taste, though I still appreciated the effort. Here the speed at which the action unfolds is almost as if Spielberg had deliberately teased out every move in such a masterful and elegant way that at times my jaw actually dropped open. The creativity at work in this film is easily on a level with his, or anyone else's, best work. It delivers such a pleasurable and memorable ride that I doubt it'll be topped as sheer entertainment anytime soon. You might quibble with the ending a bit, but I've never seen such a magnificent effort accomplished in a situation where every eye in the world was on the director demanding something special. For me this was Spielberg putting one across the bow of Tarantino's franchise, probably his only rival in this genre, and that by itself is worth cheering about.I dragged my wife to this movie last night but even she was glad she hadn't missed it. Don't you miss it! For movie lovers especially this is truly a treat.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

230,diac228,"Oh no, please, please no....NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!",6,26 May 2008,"Today, a part of my childhood has died. Today, my faith in the movie industry has been shot. Today, I weep softly and quietly in the corner of the theater as the credits roll. Indiana Jones, easily one of the best movie characters involved in one of the best movie trilogies in history, has been handed a bad script, way too much CGI, weak character development, and above all, an overall subpar film. What makes it all worse is that the potential was easily there, however with the direction that movies has gone to, we can only watch in horror as one of the great movie franchises of the past gets reduced into the average, run-of-the-mill summer flick. Even with all that's said and done it's still slightly entertaining, but nowhere near as good as Spielberg's best summer work. They should have ended the franchise with Indiana Jones riding out into the sunset.The disappointment stings more simply because the previous three installments weren't just good, they were damn good. Two of the three rank among the best films of all-time, the third film (Temple of Doom, in case you didn't figure it out) still ranks among the better action/adventure movies in recent decades. I didn't want to believe it. I did not want to write this review. This has to be a bad dream, it just has to be. Usually, I do not incorporate myself into these reviews, but since this affected me on a much more personal level, ""I"" will be used extensively. It can't be, it just can't. The finger-pointing as to who and what to blame will occur, but let's at least point out the reasons it gains the stars it gains out of me.We can start with the acting. Harrison Ford is born to be Han Solo, and Indiana Jones, nobody else. He is a decent actor sure, but fits into the role of Indiana Jones like a perfect pair of pants. In here he is no different. While the age is beginning to appear, his ability to take punches and deliver them remains intact. Cate Blanchett, while not the best Indy villain, holds her own as the knowledge-seeking Russian that looks and sounds like a live-action Edna Mode from The Incredibles. The musical score by John Williams is superb, even if most of it is borrowed from the previous installments. The plot in the beginning of the movie was fairly good. There are fun one-liners and jokes in the first third of the picture.The blaming begins now. I couldn't resist myself much longer. It took almost 20 years for another Indiana Jones installment and this is the best plot that could be written to continue the series? The plot will not be discussed here but not only is it the weakest of the four, its also the most unbelievable, has the worst dialogue, has old and new characters come out of literally nowhere, and jabbers around exactly like the main folks in National Treasure. Spielberg did the best he could with such a bad script, but ultimately couldn't save it. There is way too much CGI, and especially for a movie franchise that has had a history of depending on groundbreaking and award-winning stunts. The CGI doesn't fit the movie at all, and LucasArts has to watch its back, because Disney is slowly but surely rising as the best company for making special effects (See examples Pirates of the Caribbean, Prince Caspian). The action moments rely so much on computers and special effects that it actually deters from the drama and tension that's supposed to be occurring.Gone is the usual excellent introduction that has little to do with the remaining plot. Gone are the massive set pieces that can hold up to three action sequences. Gone is the dependence on realistic and amazing stuntwork. Gone is the epic final sequence that delivers excellent powers and unimaginable deaths. Gone is the excellent ending. The level of disbelief is at its highest, and the level of character interaction and development is at its lowest. The movie felt more like National Treasure and even The Mummy in some instances rather than Indiana Jones. Not even a decent cameo-like appearance of Karen Allen could keep the movie afloat.Bottom Line: It hurts so much to give an Indiana Jones a low score, but it needs to be done. It will make its money, it will probably warrant another sequel, but there's so much that needs to be done before anyone can even think about a fifth installment. They need to head back to the basics, the gritty, smart, and stunt-filled action quality of the first three. A formula has already been branched out for Spielberg to follow when making an Indy flick; its time to stop that and change the rules a little, but not too much to a point that it's unrecognizable. Nostalgia has to be removed; in order to fix the future one must let go of the past. George Lucas, you should be taking notes, after all you remain responsible for turning one of the great movie villains into a whiny baby and butchered a franchise that used to be mediocre film-free.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't all bad, but it could have been so much better, and it brought the quality of an old franchise down several notches. This should be the final Indiana Jones movie, but do we really want it to end this way? There should be a sequel only to erase the memory of this one. I am still shocked and saddened at what I just witnessed. It was like your biggest hero getting beaten to a pulp, and not being able to do anything about it. 900 words and several tears later, I can sum this up in one sentence: Indy 4 is a disappointment beyond what anyone could imagine. At least its no Episode 1",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
231,johnnymacbest,A classic hero returns.,10,13 May 2008,"I just came back from a pre-screening of the fourth Indiana Jones movie and I say I enjoyed it IMMENSELY!!! Wow, for years now I thought that after ""War of The Worlds"" Spielberg has lost his touch; not so here. Here he returns to the basic fundamentals of the lost arts of practicality and just plain good old fashioned genuine storytelling (something that's solely lacking in today's CGI-heavy world) helped along by the big guy himself Harrison Ford along with witty and charming Shia LaBeouf as a newcomer to the franchise with George Lucas lending some support to cinematography. Ford is simply amazing as the venerable adventurer with lots of impressive stunt work. Everything is bigger and better than before, the action is of high-caliber, the plot is thorough and exciting with intelligent writing coupled with awesome special effects. But what really surprised me was that it looked like it was filmed in the 1980's; something that's rare in this Digital Age!!! I'm sure those accustomed to digital film-making may be put off, but it actually works really well and gives the film an added dose of nostalgia and sense of wonder that Spielberg brought so successfully in his past films. Not many films can achieve that feat, but I can strongly say that Spielberg has gone out on top and brought back one of the most beloved cinematic heroes around for one more time.I'm enthusiastically awaiting a sequel with open arms.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
232,kdnor2011,An Entertaining Ride,7,21 December 2012,"I would say that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull got a mixed fan response, I mean it has a 6.3 on IMDb. But with the way the internet works you will find it pretty hard to find a positive review of this movie. And this wouldn't bother me so much it's just that pretty much 90 percent of the people who complain about are literally only nitpicking. The gopher, the monkeys, the fridge, these are three very small scenes, that don't really effect the plot of the film that much, well maybe the fridge, but there have been weirder things in an Indiana Jones movie.For me, my biggest issue with the movie is that it plays it too safe. Indiana Jones is way too invincible and thus there isn't that much suspense on weather he will get out of a situation or not. I think he gets hit like three or four times in the entire film. I also hate that whole Mac being a double agent/triple agent, I mean of all the aspects you could carry over from ""Last Crusade"" you pick that? And the whole, Mutt is Indy's son felt a little forced and seemed like it was just so Indy could have more stakes.Pretty much everything else in the movie is solid, I mean there isn't much that's mind blowingly good. But the direction is great, the action scenes are a lot of fun, the acting is fine, Harrison Ford is still Indiana Jones and no one could replace him. There aren't really any annoying characters like in Temple of Doom. I actually don't mind that aliens are in the movie. Most of the special effects look good. Oveall it's just a good movie, not great, but good.So while the rest of the internet is calling this one of the worst sequels of all time, I'll just be here saying it's, just, good.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

A young friend (played by Shia LeBeouf) of Indy's old chum approaches him and tells of his quest and Indy decides to help him find him. Before you know it he's up to his old tricks (running from freaky animals and weird jungle people). Will Indy find his friend and solve an ancient mystery? See it to find out.The movie started well, but the shenanigans in the jungle just annoyed me (except the flesh eating ants, they ruled).

234,LivingDog,Indiana Jones: Jurrasic Park,5,5 April 2011,"I cannot say it any more succinctly than ""daveygandthekeyboard"" did. So I am quoting his entire review. Below I add one comment which I think makes this the perfect review of this ""just okay"" ""blockbuster""??-QUOTE- Implausible action scenes kill this movie 2 June 2008 | by daveygandthekeyboard (United States)All I can really conclude about this movie is that it was just okay. I can forgive the ludicrous plot, the cheesy ""family"" dynamic of the film, the fact that Harrison Ford is old (which is really nowhere near the worst part of this). I don't even really mind Shia LaBeouf's presence. But many of the stunts and the action scenes are so implausible that it renders all of the action scenes implausible. For example, Shia LaBoeuf sword-fighting (!) spread-eagled on two moving vehicles; a boat going over not one, not two, but three waterfalls with absolutely no one getting a scratch (I mean, what are we watching here, The A-Team?); and the ""if the film hasn't jumped the shark yet it certainly has now"" moment--Shia LaBoeuf swinging through the jungle a la Tarzan. It was ridiculous. And because these parts are (forgive my overuse of the word) implausible, it highlights the fact that the rest of it doesn't work, either. After seeing a number of old series trying to come back for another run (Rocky Balboa, Rambo, the Star Wars Prequels) I have concluded that when filmmakers attempt to cash in on a once-popular series, artistically the best they can hope for is to break even. Sometimes there really is nowhere to go but down. I wanted to love this, but the most charitable thing I can say is that it was just okay. Very disappointing. -END-QUOTE-I would add only one thing - the filmmakers should be specified as only American. The key is in the cash. They want more profit. Amazingly, they get it. This made 115 million in profit. No wonder they aren't discouraged to keep making these fiascoes.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
235,kgprophet,A little of that Indy Magic one last time,6,5 May 2012,"With a proper attitude, in other words, if you are a fan of the Indiana Jones character, you can enjoy this movie. Although the whole is not greater than the sum of it's parts, there are some fun parts. I found myself grinning, even laughing out loud at some of the gags. And that is what you get. Spielberg and Lucas developed a laundry list of action sequences over the years, and we get a half-baked plot to stitch these sequences together. So forgive the plot contrivances, but I still can't forgive the CGI gophers. It was quite obvious that it was now or never for a last go at Indy, and the Crystal Skull idea tied into Roswell is not a bad one. Ford is given a good transition to elderly scholar with dignity, and not bothered that it was obviously a younger stunt double in the action sequences.I just wish they didn't tread over familiar territory, especially within the same movie. Not once, but twice we get Indy re-enacting the truck chase sequence from the original film. The fellow traitor archaeologist, who is identical to Dr. Belloq in the first film, is flimsy at best. Time is spent talking about blacklisting and goes nowhere. Shia LaBoeuf drags his Harley to Peru for no apparent reason. Waterfalls copied from ""Temple of Doom"". The second act drags as it covers some hokey exposition. People came and went, then they came back. Dark hallways, spider webs, been there, done that. The three previous films did a little more globe-trotting than this film does. We are mostly in Peru for the duration.Spielberg's full time cinematographer Janusz Kaminski was told to shoot and light the film like the previous ones. To some extent, there is the warm orange glow on faces and trademark silhouettes. It was otherwise kicking-and-screaming, for Kaminski's signature back floodlighting is ever present. In the jungle chase scene (obviously green-screen), the lighting on the faces is a constant light source, instead of broken light and shadow as they travel along the forest floor. One can forgive the ploddy second act as some cute gags take you to the climax, which features some nice ILM eye candy.Spielberg and Lucas are more concerned about you having a fun time at that movies than how much sense it's suppose to make.

Now, Professor Jones has returned home to Marshall College -- only to find things have gone from bad to worse. His close friend and dean of the college (Jim Broadbent) explains that Indy's recent activities have made him the object of suspicion, and that the government has put pressure on the university to fire him. On his way out of town, Indiana meets rebellious young Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), who carries both a grudge and a proposition for the adventurous archaeologist: If he'll help Mutt on a mission with deeply personal stakes, Indy could very well make one of the most spectacular archaeological finds in history -- the Crystal Skull of Akator, a legendary object of fascination, superstition and fear.But as Indy and Mutt set out for the most remote corners of Peru -- a land of ancient tombs, forgotten explorers and a rumored city of gold -- they quickly realize they are not alone in their search. The Soviet agents are also hot on the trail of the Crystal Skull. Chief among them is icy cold, devastatingly beautiful Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), whose elite military unit is scouring the globe for the eerie Crystal Skull, which they believe can help the Soviets dominate the world... if they can unlock its secrets.Indy and Mutt must find a way to evade the ruthless Soviets, follow an impenetrable trail of mystery, grapple with enemies and friends of questionable motives, and, above all, stop the powerful Crystal Skull from falling into the deadliest of hands.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 10/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
237,alainenglish,Overcooked and badly characterised but Ford is as good as ever,7,27 May 2008,"This fourth episode of the ""Indiana Jones"" saga has been a long time in coming - the idea of making a sequel to ""Last Crusade"" followed the franchise's creators for nineteen years before finally coming to fruition when actor Harrison Ford challenged Spielberg to either make it by 2008 or drop the idea altogether. Whilst it's definitely good to see Indiana Jones in a new adventure again, the movie suffers from being too long in the making.Set in 1957, the story sees Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) up against the might of the Russian Army, as the seek the lost city of Akator, the resting place of a mysterious skull carved from crystal. The skull, when combined with the power of the others, will give it's owners control over people's minds. Jones is dragged into the chase by Mutt (Shia Labeouf) a teenage biker who tells him the Russians have kidnapped his mother and Professor Oxley (John Hurt) to help them in their quest. Mutt's mother turns out to be Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the spunky former bartender Indy once loved. They are faced with the deadly Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), who leads the Russians in the race to get to Akator and are helped by Indy's ally Mac (Ray Winstone) who may or may not be in league with the Russians...The film is let down by an over-cooked storyline. Over the years, scripts for this film have gone through draft after draft and this shows in the storyline which feels lame and tired and lacks the flair of the first three films. It seems to drag on in places between action scenes sometimes. What is worse is the crystal skull of the title - it's a great idea but as a McGuffin and object to motivate the story it lacks the mystical power that imbued the Holy Grail, the Ark of the Covenant and even the Sankara Stones from ""Temple of Doom"". The addition of extra-terrestrial elements near the end does not compensate for this.Characterisation is also thin on the ground. Indy's ally/nemesis Mac is very poorly fleshed out, despite Ray Winstone's best efforts. You never get a real idea of what motivates him, nor even of the friendship between him and Indiana Jones. Cate Blanchett was good as the cunning Spalko, but I still thought she could have been more menacing.During the making of this film, probably the worst kept secret about the plot was that Mutt turns out to be Jones's long-lost son. Whilst Labeouf is a competent actor and far less irritating than I thought he would be, it is difficult to see how the character could develop sufficiently to take over the series, as has been hinted by the film-makers. The relationship between Jones and Marion, despite their history, is never really explored and they barely get more than a couple of quality scenes together.There is however, much to enjoy in this picture and this boils down to one reason: Harrison Ford. Never better than when he's playing his signature role, Ford imbues Indy with an Everyman wit and humanity that is always compelling to watch. Fans will enjoy the references to the previous films, including Indy's dad and the Ark of the Covenant. Even the ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" get a mention when Indy tells Mutt he once rode with Pancho Villa.Technically the film is excellent and sports a number of proficient set-pieces, including the opener in a crate-filled warehouse, a terrific motor-cycle chase with Indy and Mutt and a jungle battle featuring a swordfight, monkeys, killer ants and a dive off a waterfall. Most of the effects are done traditionally, though the use of CGI in some places (especially in the opening) is a bit too cheesy.If Spielberg and Lucas do decide to make another one (and despite my criticisms I hope they do) I hope I don't have to wait so long for it this time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

To wait almost 20 yrs., for a fourth installment; a huge mistake. This is one of my least favorite films in the Indy saga. Most of the Cast is new, except Ford and Allen. I am not a Shia La Beouf fan, and his character just wasn't necessary. The plot is O. K., taking place in the 50's during the Height of The Cold War.Indy gets involved with a Russian Agent, Irina Spalko ( Cate Blanchett). He is accused of being a communist, and is questioned. He is mostly teaching these days. One Day he finds that his job is in jeopardy. He goes and takes time off and meets Mutt ( Shia La Beouf), who tells Indy his friend Oxley ( Late John Hurt) has disappeared in Peru, looking for the Skull of Akator. Mutt and Indy team up, to find Oxley and travel to Peru, to find the Skull Of Akator. Like every Indiana Jones film, there is the booby trapped tombs, and secret passages. The skull is said to hold incredible power that can have a debilitating effect on people if they stare at it to long. Irina Spalko wants it, because it can give her incredible power to rule the world. Once Indy arrives at the camp, he finds Marion( Karen Allen), Oxley, and discovers Mutt is his son. When He discovers Spalko is there, the two battle for the skull. In the end, they discover a hidden cave of crystal skeletons. When the Crystal Skulls are all together, Spalko believe she will have total control. Instead it destroys her, and her ultimate goal of power.

239,tankace,For Christ sake what went so wrong?,5,19 July 2016,"The Crystal Skull is by far the worst of the Indiana Jones film series and one of the worst sequels in general and know after reviewing all the original trilogy ,I will examine this beast. Those four reviews are for preparation for the Indiana Jones film which will come out in twenty seventeen. Also all of my reviews are my personal ideas about the film, TV series or program in general and if you could have fun with that flick good for you ,but I can't stand it for any reason at all!Now to be honest this flick was made in order to capitalize on to the name Indiana Jones, now I know that there have been late sequels which were really good ,like with Rocky Balboa, Creed and The Force Awakens. And I have no issue with these flicks, for crying out loud I went in 25th of December to see the Force Awakens, so yes, sequel which came long after their originals installments can be good. But when it is done poorly we get The Phantom Menance, Zoolander 2, Terminator Genisys and of course the parent of all Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull!So why did Spielberg and Lucas ,the makers of the original trilogy do that to us?First the movie knowing that the previous flick came out about two decades ago try to create nostalgia by making random references to the original, like when Indi swings to a truck, showing photos of Connery and similar things. Nostalgia can't be made by that man, you have to earn it!Now Indiana Jones is one of the most well known ,loved and admired action heroes in cinema history. His main ability was that he was a man who could take punishment and give some and that's necessary he is flesh and blood ,in the previous when he gets beaten he is shown to have a hard time getting up or defending himself because he is hurt. And with his determination and some plan on the fly he takes the upper hand. Here that charisma is nowhere for he is always on the top of every situation, with that way you can't get interested in him! Also Harrison you can't be moving around like you are in your prime when you are in your fifties!What also wrong is the villains in the movie,the Soviets. They aren't as threatening as the Nazis ,for the Nazis were the abyss of the western civilization and so see them get killed in more ways than Game of Thrones characters is awesome, the Russians ,aren't I mean yes a average Russian is tall and strong and they bit the Nazis, but nothing is better than watching this swastika wearing racists get their faces melt by ghost of the Ark! The acting is average ,not awful ,but that the end nothing gives you a lasting impression. Even LaBouf wasn't bad, but in his case not bad is a miracle! :). In short MEDIOCRE!The story is too dumb to be taken seriously. For real Magia are an interesting civilization and I want to get more of them in the big picture ,but this stereotypical tropical inhabitant isn't close to the real Magia. Shame on the producers. And now let dive in the belly of the Beast itself the Tartaros of the movie: The action scenes! If this was a B-movie then I would say OK , with a bottle of alcohol it is fine, BUT a Indianna film with ugly cgi and animals, obviously fake forest and LaBouf sword fighting over cgi Jeeps and top it all of they literally nuked the Frige, from this scene I was pretty sure that I was watching a Looney Toones cartoon! As for the alien (not beings from other dimension my ass) be back from all that, 100% sure that Giorgio A. Tsoukalos from the Ancient Aliens had wet dream when he first saw the movie!All in all the flick sucks and it doesn't deserve its title for it took one of the most loved action series of all time and hurt it up to the sky! Don't watch if you haven't already, but I am sure ,that is to little to late.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
240,Scars_Remain,Great Adventure Flick,8,23 May 2008,"I have no idea why this movie has been getting several negative reviews. It was, to say the least, stunning in just about every way. Granted, it's not as good as he originals but I would say that it's pretty close and still deserves a 10 star review. I loved just about every little thing about this movie and it is a great companion to the original films. Harrison Ford is clearly getting old but I think that adds to his character quite a bit in this film and he did a great job, as usual, as Indiana Jones. The other actors/actresses were awesome and I thought Shia LaBeouf did brilliant. The story is fantastic, I absolutely loved it! My only problems were the amount of CGI and the film was a little over the top but it wasn't enough to change the experience for me or make me deduct any points from the rating. Ultimately, it's a great movie all together.I think most fans of the original films will be pleased with this one though there will always be the whiners who want a carbon copy of the originals. Just ignore them, and see it!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
241,Med-Jasta,Another great adventure!,9,20 April 2020,"Indiana Jones finally returns and it feels like Indy. Not just because Ford but because Lucas and Speilberg have returned as well. I really like that Indy has aged. He's not a sharp as he used to be but he's still got it. He is a little more calculated.I like that between movies that Indy was a war hero. He's proved that he has the chops. He can handle the Nazis.Mutt is a great addition. He is capable and spars well with Indy. I like how Indy changes his attitude when he finds out Mutt is his kid. Ford shows this in his performance by looking at him with fondness from then on. A lot to good humor comes from this too.The crystal skull is really cool. The sound is makes is cool. At first I wasn't sure about aliens and then I realized that aliens are more believable than Christan artifacts or magic rocks.The action scenes are all really great. The motorcycle/car chase was cool. The graveyard scene and the hidden city at the end. The room with the aliens was cool. Their skeletons were very cool.My favorite thing about Indy movies: being grossed out. The ant scene was great. The end going into that guys mouth was really good. It was nice to see them use CGI to up the level of grossness.The only problem this has is that they take a few Indy things too far. Like driving off of a cliff onto a tree branch and then safely in the water? And that was her plan? Come on guys. I'll go along with the refrigerator and all that other stuff but that was too much. There's a few other moments like that.It's understandable though, I mean would anybody survive jumping out of a plane on a raft into the snow? Or survive holding onto a submarine traveling across the ocean? Most of these things fly and sometimes they don't, this movie just has more than the others.I think the biggest problem people have with this movie is that they're not kids anymore. They didn't look at these things objectively like they did as kids and they're being so critical as possible. We've grown up but the style of Indiana Jones hasn't.A great adventure and lots of fun. I hope they make some more while Harry still can. Or Mutt, he was great.Of course I love at the end when Mutt grabs the hat and just before he puts it on Indy grabs it to say, ""Not yet.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
242,barrys82,The comeback of a hero,9,26 May 2008,"The wait for a new Indiana Jones movie is finally over, after 20 years at last it's in theaters the latest Indy adventure and it was just as expected. A really good mix of Lucas production, Spielberg's direction, Harrison Ford again as Indiana Jones and the new addition of Shia LaBeouf makes this film a real success. A movie full of action, adventure, really good moments of humor, nice twists and really good special effects. The direction of Spielberg is splendid, I must applaud his job in this movie , I felt it so old school using CGi just for the strictly necessary. It has a very interesting story and the plot is very original combining ancient cultures and outer space creatures. The music by John Williams is as always perfect and the landscapes used as locations are beautiful. The cast is conformed by all-star actors and actresses such as Harrison Ford the still has the mojo to perform as Indiana Jones, it feels like that the ages won't pass through him. Cate Blanchett is excellent as the villain her performance was really a joy. Shia LaBeouf improving his acting everyday his is great in his role of ""Mutt"" Williams/Henry Jones III. The secondary roles of John Hurt, Karen Allen and Ray Winstone were very good and very important for the film. To conclude, this is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies of 08, so faithful to the Indiana Jones formula that fans won't be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
243,Trevor-Kerensky,Back to the basics with Indy,7,18 December 2017,"I was excited when I heard Indy was coming back for another adventure and so was Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg. I went into the movie without expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. No, it's not perfect and there were some things that could have been better, but on the whole, I enjoyed it. And this is the only one of Shia LaBeouf's movies I actually enjoyed. Some might find this fun while others may find it disappointing, but the originals weren't exactly flawless either. But try to keep an open mind and an open heart and you'll be waiting for Indiana Jones 5, which comes out in 2020. I know I am!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
244,TheHonestCritic,This movie is the epitome of a cash-grab!,4,9 May 2019,"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008), wow, that's an annoyingly long title. This is yet another movie on my top 10 most disappointing movies list! When I first heard there was a new ""Indiana Jones"" movie in the works, I thought: ""oh great, another reboot that'll most likely tarnish the original franchise."" Then, when I saw Harrison Ford was going to be in it, I said to myself: ""wait, this is a sequel?"" After that, I got excited to see it. I figured that they had a lot of time to come up with a great movie, so it should be a masterpiece! Right? WRONG! I watched it in the theater on opening day, and went home very disappointed. Lackluster storyline, boring sets/locations, and the acting is all over the place, especially from Shia LaBeouf. Even if he wasn't in the ""movie"" it still would've sucked! The only redeeming elements are the special effects of course, and the soundtrack composed by the one and only John Williams. This movie franchise suffers a parallel history of going from a phenomenal to horrible, just like the ""Independence Day"" franchise. It was one of the longest two hours I spent in a cinema! It's such a shame for this movie series. We went from a perfect trilogy, to one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As far as I'm concerned, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" does not exist, it shouldn't have in the first place. It's nothing but a cash-grab, and now they're planning on making a fifth one. I could scream! Unfortunately nowadays, it seems that making money is more valuable than making great entertainment. I give this ""film"" only 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this ""movie"", just stick with the original ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy. That is, without a shadow of a doubt, my all-time favorite movie trilogy, it's absolutely perfect in my opinion. Just pretend that the fourth film doesn't exist. Wait, what is this ""fourth"" ""Indiana Jones"" film you speak of?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
245,PoisonKeyblade,Second Best of the Series!,10,5 June 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the newest in the series that started with the critically-acclaimed Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it is also the most unique. Hot off the steam from other action-adventure films like Chronicles of Narnia and The Mummy, director Steven Spielberg brings a new spin on a somewhat tired genre and integrates all sorts of little quirks here and there. There are numerous winks and nods towards the other films and outstanding performances aplenty. The newest Indy film features Harrison Ford, Shia LaBeouf, Karen Allen, and Cate Blanchett in the leading roles.After his run-in with artifact-seeking Russians, famed archaeologist and ""part-time teacher"" Indiana Jones is called back into action. A young man named Mutt Williams (LeBeouf) comes to Indy seeking help. It appears that one of Indiana's close friends, Professor Oxley, disappeared somewhere in the Amazon, and he left all sorts of clues to a huge conspiracy. At the center of the ordeal is the mysterious Crystal Skull, an ancient artifact that Indy finds that has a very peculiar significance. On his newest adventure, Indy finds himself teaming up with Mutt and his old flame, Mary (Allen), while constantly on the run from the Nazis on the search for the hidden treasure.The acting, as expected, was absolutely phenomenal. Harrison Ford plays Indiana with all the panache that has become expected in this phenomenal role. He is Indiana Jones, from the hat to the whip and even the silhouette. Ford is so comfortable in this role that his performance seems effortless by most standards. As a newcomer to the series, Shia LeBeouf had a big legacy to live up to, and I must say that he made the role very believable. He will leave a lot of viewers awestruck with his portrayal of greaser Mutt Williams, who slowly turns into a very likable character throughout the movie. Karen Allen seems to be loving every minute of her time on screen as fan favorite Marion Ravenwood. In fact, her charm and enthusiasm makes the on screen chemistry between her and Ford all the more noticeable. Had they cast a different romantic lead, the movie would basically have fallen flat on its face. And then there's Cate Blanchett. The stunning woman who played Queen Elizabeth I and Bob Dylan in the same year gives such an over-the-top performance as Irina Spalko that most people will be split on whether to hate it or love it. I, for one, loved the performance, and I felt like in the end, she was the most memorable of all the villains.As far as Indiana Jones films go, this one had an especially complex plot and loads of stunning special effects. Every scene was layered with some sort of complex CGI shot, and at times it distracted from the overall feel of the movie. However, the personalities of the characters and the acting alone never made anything feel fake. The movie was also very atmospheric at times, and the last fifteen minutes of the movie alone elevate it far above the worst in the Indy series, Raiders of the Lost Ark.While Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is probably still the most classic of all the movies, Crystal Skull is probably the most complex. A lot of effort was put into this production, making it one of the best movies of the year so far. Harrison Ford has still got it, and I wouldn't be even vaguely surprised if they made several more films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
246,PeterRoeder,Excellent!,8,25 May 2008,"I don't understand the negative comments on this movie. First of all, anyone who knows anything about George Lucas would know that this is the finest he can produce. The story of this movie is like the Lucasfilm games such as Zak McCracken. In other words, it is simply awesome. Great imagination and great fun. All other aspects of the movie are also very good. Actually this is more like Indiana Jones 2 than Indiana Jones 4. Number two and three did not add much to the series other than telling us about Indy's father. This one has all the charm and wonder of the first one which we loved so much when we were children. In other words, this is the finest of the finest piece of work of the imagination and people should respect that.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
247,henrycoles9,Best Indiana Jones ever,10,27 January 2021,"And Shia LaBeouf, John Hurt and Cate Blanchett are definitely to thank for it. Such a wonderful cast along with an incredibly exciting adventure in South America.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
248,Dockelektro,As much as you'd expect it,7,23 May 2008,"Alright, so it isn't fair. In an era where the people on their early thirties are granted constant revivals of everything that defined their youth (Blade Runner, Star Wars, forty-year-old bands meeting together and performing on stage again), Indiana Jones was really the last straw. Over the years, the mouthwatering prospect of seeing another Jones film made us sniff every hint of a rumor and every shred of news related with it. It finally has arrived, with a mammoth-size ball of hype on its shoulders. Let's admit that nothing on Earth could ever satisfy such a monster. So after we face it, let's get to the facts. It certainly is another age, and the filmmakers know that. We are not in an era of gaudy excess and over-the-top sequences. The days of campy, slick humor and faster-than-you-can-have-it action seem to be gone. And it's no wonder. Never forget that in the last ten years Steven Spielberg dedicated himself to much more serious fare, with very mixed results. As a result, Indy's much more dark and slow. He faces different kinds of problems and challenges, his reactions are different. He's starting to give in. But then again, the man is 67! Therefore, it seems logic that he no longer is the one-man-army he used to be. It's perfectly natural that he relies much more on his wits that on his fists. But don't let my word fool you: the movie has action, lots of it. What's really ironic is that the things that should help the movie in this age of digital possibilities are the things that cram it with unbelievability. It really bugs me that they achieved a film look that is up to par the 80's originals and then goes the ""King Kong"" way with CGI jungle scenes that completely take the realism out of it. It's a great statement of how computer images are starting to get really cheesy when they're made in quantity and not in quality (Mutt's vine-swinging anyone?). But to dismiss this movie as trash is to be cruelly unfair. It is a worthy successor to the original movies, and a truckload of fun. Yes, maybe they could have gone deeper with their main theme, yes it sometimes succumb to the George Lucas school of ""do it in CGI"", but it doesn't sacrifice the heart and soul of this movie. You just have to take it lightly and not like the violation of something holy. The new Star Wars trilogy proved that you can't take things too seriously. If even so you will choose to remain glued to the past and don't accept that Indy also ages, then you will be very annoyed. Everyone else will have a blast.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
249,mnpollio,A more than worthy addition to the Indiana Jones adventures,9,3 April 2009,"Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas once again pool their talents to once again bring us another installment in the Indiana Jones series, and though the result falls short of the original film, it does fit comfortably into the gallery of sequels that followed and is nowhere near the disappointment that naysayers would have one believe. Updated to the 1950s, Crystal Skull depicts an older, but assuredly not slower Ford as the embattled archaeologist, who this time is in a race with the Russians to rescue friends from his past and claim the title prize. Among what works: Ford slips back into the Indy role as though nearly two decades had never passed between outings. The Russians are an inspired choice as antagonists and Cate Blanchett is the most memorable villain the series had offered since Ronald Lacey's Peter Lorre-ish Toht from the original. Shia LeBeouf would seem like a third wheel as the young greaser who sets Jones off on his quest, but he manages to hit all the right notes to make his addition increasingly welcome. The film looks spectacular and, for the most part, eschews Lucas' standard over-reliance on CGI effects. The film also steers clear of the ridiculous trend – over-utilized by the Bourne films - wherein the action sequences are edited in such lightening fast quick cuts as to render them virtually incoherent. Instead, we get action scenes the old-fashioned way as something to be savored and not rushed through for those with ADD. As such, both the opening and the jungle chase are highlights in the series. Best of all, Indy's first and best leading lady, Karen Allen, makes a belated return to the series and watching his face light up on their meeting pretty much encapsulates audience reaction to her return. Allen appears thrilled to be back and her joy translates to the viewer. The reliance on sci-fi elements does not bother me as much as many viewers given that these films have always had a fantasy/sci-fi bent, so the bellyaching seems especially unwarranted. Their criticisms would seem to imply that an ark that melts off people's faces, magic rocks and a cup that offers eternal life, were somehow more ""real"" than the concept of an alien civilization, when they pretty much occupy the same realm of fantasy. A number of minor elements prevent this film from reaching Raiders heights. The CGI effects with the ants stick out like a sore thumb largely because the film has kept away from such. About the time that our heroes arrive in South America, the pace slows down substantially and devolves into a case of chronic exposition that lasts until the return of Blanchett and the arrival of Allen. Newcomers John Hurt and Ray Winstone are not well served by the story. Hurt seems in a constant state of bewilderment, while Winstone changes sides so frequently that it becomes impossible to be even slightly invested in him. While the opening action scene is tremendously exciting, its conclusion is so unbelievably ludicrous that it strains credibility far more than the ""alien"" elements of the story. While Allen's spirited return is welcome, she arrives relatively late and has precious little of substance to contribute other than amusing banter, following orders and running. Most disturbing, the screenplay seems to have an anti-knowledge/education bent that would seem to be at odds with its hero. Indy spends a good deal of time scoffing at institutions of higher learning and the pursuit of knowledge. Conversely, the script seems to take the stand that Blanchett is somehow worse for having an unquenchable thirst for knowledge rather than the devious means to which she plans to use said discoveries. This entry had the difficulty of being followed by Iron Man and The Dark Knight, both action films which are technically better and helped diminish its memory. However, when searching for a fun light-hearted evening watch, I find myself returning to this film over the other two largely because it is missing the slick glibness of Iron Man and the almost unrelenting spirit of despair of the powerful The Dark Knight. This is definitely a successful foray for the intrepid Jones and I personally would love to see another reunion with he, Mutt and Marion on another grand quest.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
250,come2whereimfrom,Does what it says..,6,30 May 2008,"So the man in the hat is back, older than before, but still on whip cracking form 19 years after his last outing, the slap sticking-ly bad 'Last Crusade.' Harrison Ford once again plays Dr. Jones this time looking for a crystal skull. Firstly let me just say that the introduction of Indy back into our consciousness is one that is not only a spectacle to behold but a moment you won't forget for its sheer audacity and it starts the film off with a bang. From here on in its business as usual as Indy helps Mutt (Labeouf) track his step father who has already set off on the trail of the legendary skull. With the Russians close behind led by the ever gorgeous Blanchett it's a roller-coaster of a trip as we enjoy some great set pieces, from the spooky graveyard to the tank chase and finishing with the final flurry that I won't spoil by mentioning here. Along the way you get little turns from Winstone, Hurt and Broadbent but despite his age its Fords film as he wise cracks and whips his way around the story, you get a real sense that he enjoyed being back in the role that, along with Han Solo, he will be remembered most for. The funniest thing I have heard people say is that it's a little far fetched to which I have to remind them that this is probably the most plausible of the four, the ark of the covenant and holy grail anyone? Anyway all that said I enjoyed reliving my youth a little and although it's not a five star film it stays true to the originals and certainly doesn't try to upset like the new Star Wars or Transformers did. It is an adventure film laden with humour that made going to the cinema a joyful experience and something has to be said for that in this day and age. So not life changing but does what it says on the tin. A solid effort from Spielberg and Lucas, I imagine it will go down well on television on Christmas day in many years to come when a heavy lunch means light entertainment is all the family can manage.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
251,barberoux,Not great,6,23 May 2008,"I thought it was a fun movie with an odd lack of suspense. Action sequences were OK, entertaining but they lacked spark. The cast was wasted except for Cate Blanchett who was the best thing about the movie. Ray Winstone, a good actor, was almost invisible and Karen Allen was little more than a nice smile. Shia LeBeauf was a nonentity. John Hurt's character was fun but it could have been played by anybody and his enormous talent wasn't on display. Besides Cate Blanchett the cast, including Harrison Ford, were just going through the motions. I would have like to have seen more unknowns play the parts then maybe you could suspend belief long enough to enjoy the story. The beginning with the blast and rocket sled was fun. The cycle chase was good but it went down hill from there. The rest was a rerun of action scenes from past adventure flics and totally PG. A hot babe is wet jungle gear would have helped. Cate Blanchett was too cool to sweat. It was an entertaining 2 hours but really totally forgettable soon afterward. As a summer blockbuster it pales next to Ironman.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
252,patches89,"WHY DONT YOU STICK AROUND, JUNIOR!!",8,29 June 2021,Of course the old trilogy is untouchable but this the 4th installment of the franchise gets unnecessary hate around the horn.

253,curtis-8,"Plot/story is fine, CGI, subtle racism hold it back",6,6 March 2017,"One of the few people that actually kind of liked Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal skull. I thought the basic story was good not any more ridiculous than any of the other ones. Settings characters and acting were all good.If they had just resisted the urge to use so much CGI and hadn't produced so much totally unbelievable action, it would've been another classic of its kind. Not only is the CG are used to make the characters do things to hurt physically impossible, it is also not very good CGI with a fake green screen kind of look that I haven't seen for 30 years. They should've just stayed totally practical use the old time effects.Secondarily I was struck by the total lack of any actors of color. No black people Asian Indians no arabs. Nothing but white folk. None except ""natives.""Might've been cool back in 1981 but now that just makes the film stick out. Any number of supporting characters could've been something other than white. I have to say that on the second viewing this kind of stuck in my craw.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
254,ExpendableMan,Indiana Jones and the Little Green Men,7,23 May 2008,"""I am a Capitalist and they pay well,"" a character remarks early in this film, a sentiment that the more cynical among us might detect lurking behind every frame of the latest Indiana Jones saga. While Spielberg hasn't exactly been delivering cash bombs lately, he hasn't had a genuine box office triumph since Saving Private Ryan in 1997 and just the name of the title character would be enough for the box office rewards to be astronomical. Whatever the reasons for dragging Henry Jones Jr back into the limelight though, his latest adventure still captures enough of the giddy thrills and spills of the original trilogy to save this being a Phantom Menace level disaster. That being said, it's not the triumphant return to form that fanboys have called it either but when you've got Raiders Of The Lost Ark as the benchmark there's bound to be a few audience members who can't help feeling slightly let down.This is a film that positively brims over with nostalgia. Karen Allen's mannerisms when she first lays eyes on Indy for instance are still exactly the same as they were in her 'Raiders' introduction, while Ford's bickering with new boy Shia Lebeouf is reminiscent of the old/young dynamic he previously enjoyed with Sean Connery. Alongside this is a wealth of adventures in corpse and cobweb bedecked crypts, jungles teeming with tattooed tribes, plummets down waterfalls and car chases with military vehicles that are prime boy's own escapism. It's over the top lunacy with a wealth of old-fashioned stunts and sparkling dialogue and when it's accompanied by that all-too-familiar John Williams score, you'd have to be humourless or dead not to have a grin traverse your face and start bouncing in your seat with excitement.At the centre of this whirlwind of retro-fun of course is the man himself; Harrison Ford still looking immensely comfortable in that dusty old jacket and battered Fedora. He might now have a noticeable tuft of grey hair poking out beneath the rim of his hat but you can tell that he put in a tremendous effort to make sure his character emanated that old magic once more. Shame then that some of the set pieces are just a bit too big for him (Jones, not Ford) and it's hard to link the bewildered average-Joe turned action hero with the indestructible superman who survives an atomic explosion at the start of the movie. Sure he might have had some unbelievable escapes in the past, but walking away from a nuclear blast is a stretch too far and the scene turns into a credibility-winding attempt to keep up with Jack Bauer. The sight of him watching an expanding mushroom cloud is definitely a memorable one though.Plot-wise a lot of things have happened in the twenty year gap. Jones is still teaching archaeology but thanks to his efforts during World War 2 is also a Colonel in the American army. Whatsmore, Henry Jones Sr and his old friend Marcus Brody have both passed away, leaving our hero at that stage in life when things are taken away from us rather than given. As the Red Scare grips the US however, Indy winds up in the midst of a globe-trotting mission to find a mythical Crystal Skull with new sidekick 'Mutt' Williams (Shia Lebouef). With a platoon of Russian soldiers led by Cate Blanchett's ice-cold Irina Spalko following though, this is going to be no easy task.Needless to say, everything is in place for an enjoyable slice of old-time fun but for all the plus points, there are a few things that let it down. The supernatural element to the series has been replaced by a science fiction undertone which won't sit well with a lot of fans, especially the dodgy sequence with the CGI ants that could have been lifted wholesale from The Mummy. It's also far too apparent that Ray Winstone was cast because Spielberg admired him but then couldn't come up with anything for his character to do. Add to this a pace that slows dramatically in the third act and an unsatisfactory ending and it's only too clear why some people are leaving with a bad taste in their mouth. All these niggles aren't enough to ruin the movie though and hopefully, when looking back on it, people are going to remember the pulse-pounding action, the enchanting characters and the goosebumps on their arms when he first steps into view and coolly slides the hat back onto his head. And hey, it's much, much better than both National Treasure films put together. Welcome back Doctor Jones, now for the love of God, please retire.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
255,Thrashman88,Close encounters of the indy kind!,6,15 June 2008,"INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is an OK fourth installment in the Indiana Jones saga, but if you expect something like either of first two films, or even the third one, you might get disappointed. This new movie takes place in the middle of the 50's, 19 years after LAST CRUSADE. War is over, Nazis are history and there are no real tangible enemies so to speak. The only thing closer to the Nazis would be the communists, and so this time they become the baddies. Cate Blanchet plays an evil commie in the pursuit of a mystical crystal skull. Again, the skull possesses powers that lure all who are power-hungry.The first half of the movie, despite having some action and chase sequences , is pretty slow and things pick up well past 3/4's of the movie. After battling godly powers and mystical stones, what or who else could be a worthy match for Indiana Jones??? Well, how about extra terrestrials? This was Spielberg's crossover of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and INDIANA JONES. Though the ending was alright, it didn't leave me as stunned as with the ending in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Sure, the effects this time around are more sophisticated but they will never match the sheer intensity of the older movies. Having said this, I'm pleased to tell that the CGI effects are not as ""overwhelming"" as in other movies. It seems that Spielberg tried to keep it as old fashioned as possible. On the acting side, well, you can't go wrong: there's the return of Indy's true love, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), only this time she's the mother of a teenager brat named Mutt (Shia La Beouf). The immensely talented John Hurt (ELEPHANT MAN, ALIEN, V for VENDETTA) is in there somewhere, but his character could've been performed by anyone really, so his talents are greatly wasted.All in all, it was an entertaining movie and perhaps my expectations were a bit too high for this new Indiana Jones movie. I seriously doubt that a fifth movie could be made, but in Hollywood you never know. As long as audiences keep coming, there will always be an INDIANA JONES.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
256,Jacques98,Well . . . I liked it. Please don't hurt me.,8,6 September 2008,"I'll just be honest and say that I didn't grow up in the Indy films. I tried watching them when I was five and they were a little too intense for me, and as I got older I never found the time to re-watch them. Thirteen years later when Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came out I simply loved it. Maybe that's because I wasn't a hardcore fan in my youth and don't remember seeing the ""real"" Indy movies, or maybe it's because this really was a good movie and the negative reviews are from people who felt betrayed. I don't know. All I can say is I liked this movie for what it was.The only complaint I can even think of about this movie is the beginning is a little slow. Other than that, I found everything else to be truly amazing, if not the best Indiana Jones I ever remember seeing.I loved the over-the-top plot that even the most hardcore fans of the series wouldn't have guessed. I thought some of the action was absolutely some of the best I've ever seen on film. Some of the brutal action even came back from the older movies, and I loved that. The characters are similar to Star Wars in that they are not forgettable, and actually have, you know, character.Maybe this was just an Indy movie made for the new generation that didn't grow up on them. I can understand hardcore fans feeling betrayed as they saw the silliness again and didn't remember it being there, but it was.

Soviet agents, led by psychic Irana Spalko a superb Cate Blanchett) force them to help locate the whereabouts of a mysterious artifact. Indy manages to escape their clutches and get back to Marshall College, where he learns that he must take an indefinite leave of absence as he's now feared of being a communist sympathizer. When heading for his next destination he's greeted by a young man by the name of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), who asks of Jones to help him search for Indy's old friend Harold Oxley (John Hurt), a researcher who had once found a crystal skull of unknown origin in the mountains of Peru. Mutt desperately needs Indy's help, informing him that his mother Marion (Karen Allen) has been kidnapped by those seeking the skull, in a bid to unlock its secret powers and put an end to the cold war. i was pleased with this latest installment unfortunately there is a slight over abundance of CGI but this is used sparingly, along the way there are superb set pieces set to John Williams trademark score, which will have you leaving theaters with a dumb grin.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

They were called 'Raiders of The Lost Ark' etc.This movie is so lazy - plot, characterisation, chases, set ups - all done on auto pilot. Oh, Indy, sorry Henry Jones, can now fight and punch better than ever at 55 or more - he can beat your huge Russian schmuck to a bloody pulp! Oh, and he can walk out onto the Nevada desert and witness, minus glasses etc, a nuclear explosion mushroom like a couple of miles away! Only interesting bit is Spielberg condemning the fifties as totally cardboard and boring, by showing a lot of mocked up dummies portraying people for testing the effects of the nuclear blast. From there the film goes downhill fast. The crystal skull is just like the 'Sixth Element.' By the way, how did the 16th century Spanish manage to steal the skull without entering the temple and finding the gold?? Watch the DVD extras and see Lucas and Spielberg have a serious conversation about whether the endgame should feature aliens or inter-dimensional beings, and Lucas apparently insisting that 'Kingdom' must be in the title of the movie. Seriously for two people who have entertained so many for so long - you need a new life, boys, and it shouldn't be in movies anymore, if this is all the cr** you can produce!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
259,patriciogl10,A pleasant escapade.,7,6 December 2019,"Indy's fourth installment is an average one, yet it fulfils the important function of entertaining, which is extremely important in a franchise of Indiana Jones' caliber. I understand how most users claim that the script and story are heavily defective, but I wouldn't go as far as calling this a bad film. There's some impressive action sequences; Cate Blanchett plays a fine villain and while Shia Labeouf's performance is nondescript, and rather forgettable, doesn't do much to actually damage the film, which would seem a bit excessive.All in all, I find this film to be entertaining, and plot issues aside, it can be considered an acceptable effort within the franchise, obviously coming at last in terms of quality, ultimately enjoyable nevertheless.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
260,stormhawk2021,Indiana and my childhood strampled.,1,13 May 2017,"At first, I thought another Indiana Jones movie in my country (Peru) sounded great!....Wait, what if it sucks? Going back and adding another movie to the legendary series comes with the highest of expectations. Simply making a movie with the same-old characters may pack the box offices, but makes people furious if it taints them. This movie is tragic in so many ways. The digitized sets look terrible and seem completely out of character for these movies. Indiana Jones never was realistic, but at least the laws of physics still applied. Also, had a lots of mistakes: Mayan pyramids in the Peruvian jungle with Iguazu Falls included (in reality is Hawaii, and the Iguazu Falls were in the border of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay), the Nazca Lines in Cuzco, Pancho Villa had learned Quechua, Mariachi music at the Cuzco scene...Hey! This is Peru, not Mexico! Many of the action sequences are a joke. At one, point Indy survives an atomic blast by hiding in a refrigerator. If that sounds bad, how about some sword fighting while simultaneously swinging on jungle vines amongst angry moneys like Tarzan? It gets worse the same sword fight continues while opposing foes balance on the structural framework of two safari jeeps moving at 50 miles per hour. This is unacceptable garbage for any movie, much less Indiana Jones! Bringing Shia LaBeouf (the kid of ""Transformers"") on board as a son, rather than a sidekick is another painful flaw. His acting is not the problem; it is just a horrible character. The dialogue between is LaBeouf and Ford is a woefully bad. The overall plot is questionable, and the extraterrestrial ending is unbelievably terrible. Here once again, it defies the established level of reality for the series. It is hard to know who to be disappointed with more. George Lucas is defiling one of his greatest creations. Yes, it is a significantly worse let down than the new Star Wars trilogy. How could Spielberg with all of his integrity let this happen? Why did Harrison Ford agree to do this after reading the script? I tried making excuses for it at first, and tried to like it because I love the other three movies so much. After a point, I realized this is just a bad movie. In fact, I hate this movie, and wish it did not exist. It is a disaster in every way, from the down to the details and execution. This failure is the sort of thing people will talk about for decades later.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
261,tburke85,Indiana Jones Better Than Expected But With Some Flaws,7,29 May 2009,"Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was much better than expected but with some flaws. Fortunately the good outweighs the bad. Harris Ford is back Indy and he still proves to be the perfect person for the role. Ford continues to show his great talent as an actor especially during some of the action sequences. The rest of the cast turn in good performances including Cate Blanchette as Irina Spalko a Soviet who seeks artifacts tied to the supernatural, Ray Winstone as Indy's corrupt partner George 'Mac' Michale, John Huston as Indy's old friend Professor Oxley, and Shia LaBeouf as Indy's sidekick Mutt Williams. Karen Allen is back as Indy's love Marion Ravenwood and even after all this time like Ford she continues to show she's the perfect actress for that role. Well done. Jim Broadbent makes a brief cameo appearance as Indy's friend Dean Charles Stanforth and he does a good job with the small role he has in the movie. As far as the action sequences go must of them are well executed except there are some that go over the top. For those of you who have seen it you know what i mean. Director Steven Spielberg continues to show his talent as a filmmaker and this film is no different. The special effects are cool and the story is pretty interesting but I had to watch it twice just to understand what the heck it was all about. Desipte it's flaws this fourth movie in the Indiana Jones series is still an entertaining action adventure with some humor thrown in that makes for an enjoyable movie to watch.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
262,doorsscorpywag,Ed Wood with a budget,1,4 June 2008,I did not expect to see a worse movie than Iron man in 2008 ....especially so early.... so Indiana Jones and The temple of crap certainly was an unexpected surprise. As a fan of Indie in the first outing(as well as IM comics in the 60s BTW)I did not expect too much from the Cheesemeister and an aged Harry Ford but Ray Manzarek could have come up with a better effort frankly and he is so utterly inept as a filmmaker with most dead people able to make better movies than the ex Doors man. Why Speilberk is put forward as some kind of brilliant filmmaker is beyond me as apart from his take on Oskar Shindler his movies are pap with lots of explosions and million dollar effects. This time round he has excelled himself in the art of p#ss poor film making. We pretty much are signposted towards what is one of cinemas most boring climaxes ever when we get to the warehouse full of boxes scene just before the surviving a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge and being blown half a mile through the air one. The debut Indy was fun and actually a decent film followed by a couple of half worth watching duds but this crud pretty much sums up the Speilberk decades of Ed Wood style filmaking with huge budgets to paper over the cracks and steer the audience away from the fact they are watching garbage. Why did he not just have a couple of velociraptors at the end and stun us with Jeff Goldblum making an appearance as Indies long lost brother Arizona. WOTW was bad enough but Crystal Skull even beats that turkey..........,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
263,jonathanruano,A disappointing Indiana Jones,3,17 February 2017,"I was hoping to see an aged Indiana Jones go on some of the most extraordinary adventures searching for ruins and crystal skulls in the Amazon. But what I got instead was an overload of special effects and very little story. Steven Spielberg's latest Indiana Jones movie poses at least two major problems. First, it's so obvious that the special effects were done on a computer that they don't seem real. As a result, we do not feel that the characters are in any danger from army ants or indeed an alien civilization with crystal skulls. Second, the plot is not particularly interesting. When the first and third Indiana Jones came out, at least the stakes seemed real to us. The first film was about uncovering the legendary Ark of the Covenant from ancient times and the third was the search for the exciting holy grail. But crystal skulls? Why would anyone want to search for those? Lastly, the villains in the story do not seem very interesting. I actually like Cate Blanchet as a person, which is why it is so hard to imagine her as a credible villain. They should have put someone else less likable in that role, like Natalie Portman. So overall, the ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was a disappointing experience.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
264,galileo3,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a greatly entertaining, silly, exotic grand adventure",6,28 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)If you have been a fan of the greatly entertaining Indiana Jones trilogy or a person who likes these types of adventure/fantasy films it is very likely that Indy IV is a film for you. If you disliked the previous Indiana Jones films then there's no convincing you otherwise with this one.Steven Spielberg, the highest grossing director of all time, re-unites with Star Wars creator George Lucas and the great Harrison Ford for another slice of classic, silly and fun Indiana Jones film. After three superb predecessors, most prominently the timeless Raiders of the Lost Ark, expectations for part IV were very high. Early internet previous suggested that the film literally sucked, whereas the film sailed relatively comfortably with positive reviews from critics at Cannes where the film premiered on May 18th.All I can say is that this is a film of maximum entertainment and fun, very well directed by Spielberg, sharply edited by Michael Kahn, superbly composed by John Williams featuring a decent and often funny script from George Lucas and company. A very good cast (aside from Ford) included Academy Award Winner Cate Blanchett, John Hurt, Ray Winstone, Karen Allen, Jim Broadbent and a young and rising star Shia LaBeouf who is actually Indy's son.The plot revolves around a group of Soviet agents led by Colonel Doctor Irina Spalko (Blanchett) who are seeking a crystal skull, that will provide the Soviet Empire with a new weapon of accessing the minds and dreams of people. The story is not exactly meant to be taken seriously, it is an adventure blockbuster after all! This time round Spielberg and Lucas made sure they had everything in the film; nuclear explosions, aliens, airplanes, trains, crystal skulls, giant colony ants, waterfalls, temples, flying saucers, you name it. If you are enticed by adventure and entertainment in cinema you should go see Indiana Jones IV. This film is guaranteed to lighten up the mood.With a total 5 day worldwide gross of $315,000,000 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is probably going to be this year's highest grossing film (or it may be surpassed by the 64th Harry Potter film, you can never know!)Bravo to Spielberg for maintaining his title as the Blockbuster King.7/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
265,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Indy's back and just as great as ever. More than worthy of being the sequel to one of the greatest trilogies ever.,9,21 May 2008,"Well, there's no doubt about it: Indy is back, whip, hat, witty lines included. In short, the unbeatable trio of Spielberg/Lucas/Ford manage to create a fourth great and fun Indy adventure, although the plot borders on absurd at the end. However, since all I wanted was another spirited adventure from one of my all time favorite heroes (and that's exactly what I got), I was more than willing to accept the fact that the movie would have its fair share of moments that would leave me wondering whether or not I was still watching an Indy movie.Without a doubt, the first 3/4 of the movie are just as great and fun as any of the original adventures, with incredible stunts (see: Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf swordfighting like acrobats), and limited CGI, however, once we reach the climax, the movie becomes something else entirely and is not anything like its predecessors. I'm telling you right now, be prepared for a climax that will make you say ""What the hell is going on? This is INDIANA FREAKING JONES!"", so don't be disappointed. What I will say about this bit is that while it is different, Spielberg pulls no punches and creates one of the most fantastic visual spectacles ever seen on film. I cannot emphasize enough how many ""WHOA!"" moments the movie has.The film is very nostalgic, and gives nods to its predecessors, as well as resolves a few characters (most notably, Indy's father). As you might already know, Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood, and her absence from ""Last Crusade"" is explained. Also, I'll answer the question that everyone's wondering. The whole ""Is Shia Indy's son?"" bit is answered somewhat early in the movie, which I liked because it meant I could focus on the rest of the movie. The visual effects are simply brilliant, while John Williams' legendary score is back in full throttle. The art and set decoration are also top notch.As for the acting, I'd have to say that this one boasts the best acting out of the four, because it has the best ensemble. And it should, with the supporting cast consisting of legends such as Jim Broadbent and John Hurt, in addition to the wonderful Cate Blanchett as the film's villain. Blanchett isn't like Indy's last female nemesis; she's truly driven and has interests only in what she wants. She's cold and ruthless, but she's also a great character to examine. Ray Winstone carries the most hateable part in the entire series, but still manages. Hurt is excellent as Indy's colleague and LaBeouf's character's mentor.When it comes to the leads, they're all great. Harrison Ford certainly looks older, but he still plays Indy the same way he did 20 years ago. He's charming, cunning, brilliant, and most of all, the audience will always love and cherish him the same way they have all this time for almost 30 years. Karen Allen, by far my favorite love interest of Indy, returns (and looks great for her age, I must say) and does not disappoint. Although I would have liked to have seen a bit more development. Shia LaBeouf...man, this kid is EVERYWHERE! And there's a reason for it. He's great, and I'd say this is his best performance along with Disturbia, because this time he's not playing a caricature of himself, and it really works. His tough guy mentality is perfect for his character, and he's just as likable as Indy himself.All in all, this fourth film is worthy of the name Indiana Jones, no doubt about it. No one slept while making this film. All the hard work paid off, and though Spielberg, Lucas, and writer David Koepp have crafted an ending that could turn some overly serious viewers off, I still enjoyed the movie very much, and did not leave disappointed in the slightest. I love Indiana Jones, and I'm so happy he's back and just as good as ever.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
266,Jay_Exiomo,Long wait ended by a disappointing hokum,5,23 May 2008,"The return of the fedora-wearing, whip-cracking archaeologist Indiana Jones in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull"" is, at most, better than the treasure hunt films that hit the screens while the third sequel was supposedly stalled in search for a better script.Nineteen years of waiting can make expectations grow to significant degrees and there's pressure on director Steven Spielberg, co-producer George Lucas, and screenwriter to David Koepp to deliver the thrill while giving justice to its iconic lead character who has been gone from the silver screen for almost two decades. (Incidentally, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" was the first movie I've seen in a theater.) Set in the late '50s, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick Mac (Ray Winstone) are captured by Irina Spalko's (Cate Blanchett) Soviet troops to help them find a secret American military artifact. This eventually leads to a treasure hunt in Peru with Indy's young new sidekick, Mutt (Shia LeBouf), the returning Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and Professor Oaxley (John Hurt).Viewed on its own, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" might pass as a fine time-waster; but considering the names involved and the mythology surrounding the film, all the more it ends as disappointing. The film tries hard to capture the zing of its predecessors but it could barely keep a viewer on the edge of the seat as it lacks the requisite excitement among the plethora of action sequences. That the lead character has aged significantly and could still pull off such stunts sometimes bordered on sheer ridiculousness. Not that Ford is supposed to have gone frail, but the effect of progression of years gone by is kept to a minimum by use of CGI, adding a sense of invulnerability and removing any sense of suspense and fallibility.Throughout the film, there's the sense that Spielberg tries his best to keep things up but eventually, ""Kingdom of Crystal Skull"" ends up as a disappointing installment that fails to be the panacea for those who have waited long for the series' return.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Didn't like seeing Shia in an Indiana Jones movie either. Plot has some interesting moments but in total kind of weird and too stereotypical; yes they did it in 50's fashion but for today it's just outdated and not necessary. Some action scenes were good, others weren't but that's just usual for movies of this series. Okay movie but none of the all-time greats.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
268,illbebackreviews,"Even as an Indiana Jones, it is more than passable",7,7 June 2013,"When a franchise has been dormant for a long period of time, especially a beloved one such as Star Wars or in this case, Indiana Jones, it is usually evident that a remake or a sequel usually results in an unnecessary addition to a franchise which ends up ruining it. This is evident with Star Wars and even Superman.However, as bad as some films may be considered, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is considered the most disappointing film next to The Phantom Menace. I disagree. Based around the crystal skull, this film tells the story of a much older Indiana Jones who is once more on a search for a crystal skull as he must ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands of the Nazis.oh wait, the Soviets. This is my biggest concern of the film right here, not the story in general but the idea of using Russians as the main villains. Each previous Indiana Jones film had a memorable villain, with the first and third using Nazis and the second using terrifying Indian people. The villains in this film are so stereotypical and bland that they immediately pass off as forgettable. Whilst Harrison Ford is as brilliant in the role as he always is, bringing in the same endearing characteristics that made him one of the most loved heroes, Cate Blanchett is horribly miscast as the main villain. When you take into consideration how great an actor she is from various films, to the point where she has won an Oscar, you'd expect her to deliver a truly great performance in such a film. Absolutely not in this case. She comes off as an irritating and very unintimidating villain who comes off as a rather laughable person never providing tension when it is needed. This is partly due to some of the poor writing and some of the poor story involved with her character but Blanchett herself is at fault in this particularly case. When you realize every other villain has cast an image in this franchise and she doesn't, there is definitely something wrong One of my favourite scenes of the film is the fantastic sequence early in the film in the warehouse where a fantastic and old school looking action sequence takes place as John Williams' legendary musical score starts bombastically dancing to its own! This scene, despite the obvious CGI backgrounds, had a lot of great action and some great humor and was an overall fun sequence. Ford immediately ensured that we wouldn't view this film the same as the Star Wars prequels as he is able to bring in an endearing personality towards Indy once more. Then the film certainly slows down and whilst some hate Shia LaBeouf, I certainly didn't mind him. I thought it was rather clever having him be Indy's son which goes well with Sean Connery being the father. Both Indy and Henry Jones Sr are wreckless fathers who try to love their children but are too busy getting caught up in their own world and life.The story itself is presented rather well even though it doesn't follow the same Indiana Jones structure. Most of the story is intriguing unlike the prequels to Star Wars and come off feeling like an adventure that Indy could go on some day. The script in this film is generally fantastic with some great moments and lines but at the same time, does have some bad dialogue. This is George Lucas' involvement.Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood from Raiders of the Lost Ark and whilst her character is present to bring back the feeling of the previous films, comes off rather irritating and doesn't do too much to help move the story. Whilst her character was great in the first film, this is where it should've left with her final known fate being having started a relationship with Indy as shown at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. When she meets Indy once more after a long time, it felt forced and rather awkward despite the two having been in a film of the same franchise, a further 25 years earlier.Steven Spielberg is a legendary writer and whilst this is critically claimed as one of his least successful films, I personally found it a joy to view the first time. Surely it is full of flaws, more so than the previous films and doesn't contain the same magical and nostalgic factor, but Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is able to overlook these issues thanks to a fantastic performance by Harrison Ford and some great action sequences early on, as well as an overall good and engaging storyline with a relatively good script. However, it is truly evident that this instalment never needed to be there for this franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Then you'll like it...,8,24 May 2008,"To tell the truth, I went to see this feature walking backwards, just thinking this picture would not be like the following Indy movies.However, I was a bit surprised to see how it went well. I watched this movie just like I watch those ""comic book"" movies: not seriously, just take the ""unpredictable"" on the light side and follow up the story...There is a bit of many of Spielberg (and Lucas... some famous quote from space...) films in this movie, including the preceding Indy movies. However, to find out, just watch the movie...By the way, performances are okay here. It is like just every comic book imagined, this time is for real... As long as we take the unpredictable lightly and get entertained again...And by the way, Indy's act at his age might not be as believable for some, but remember when Sean Connery was participating in the last Indy movie, we did accept his vigor...

270,tnrcooper,Indiana Jones and the Incoherent Tripe,1,27 May 2008,"Really, this is a very disappointing flic. 19 years for this? Can't say I'm terribly terribly surprised. There was a lot of money for Messrs. Spielberg, Lucas, Ford to make, but one is always disappointed when such an iconic franchise with such hard-won and well-deserved public affection is so tarnished with such tripe.Lucas and Spielberg absolutely phoned this one in. It's not worth commenting on. There were a bunch of elements obviously included simply to cater to different demographic groups and bring as many people into the theater as possible. Shia LeBoeuf (literally, the beef) seems ridiculously amped up at the beginning of the film, playing a stereotypical '50s rebel (complete with ""On the Waterfront"" hog-riding Brando homage; please let's not get ahead of ourselves Steven) who thinks that his pompadour and leather jacket really are intimidating. He is there for The Kids. Karen Allen (Marion Ravenswood) is back and is as charming as ever. She's there for those who cut their teeth, or for whom the first two films were important signposts in childhood. And then......and then......there are ridiculous computer-generated monkeys and gophers......For The Wee Ones....coz everyone knows the Wee Ones Like the Silly CGI animals. I have no idea what this film is about other than that it's about some treasure which supposedly will load your dishwasher, do your homework, and make love to your wife every other Tuesday, if only Indy can find it. (Whaddaya think the odds are on that Nostradamus?) The first three films were notable for skirting the line behind fantasy and reality and allowing the viewing audience to indulge their fantasies a bit while retaining enough dry humor and recognizable humans to re-assure us that we were indeed watching humans. Spielberg was the king of the event movie and that is not an insult. There was an art to it and it wasn't necessarily bad. Here, however, it seems he has simply looked for some CGI, dug Indy's Fedora out of cobwebs, solicited a very John Williamsy score from......surprise surprise, John Williams, created some hocus-pocus Castle In The Sky for Indy to chase, peopled his film with some excellent actors-in this case Cate Blanchett, John Hurt, Ray Winston, Jim Broadbent, all whose talents are wasted by a completely incoherent and derivative script-and assumed he could make a boatload of money. Undoubtedly he will. However, this is the most cynical and calculating sort of film-making. This is really a terrible mess of a film and it's sad that more could not have been done after 19 years.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
271,Rcwilkinson123,What a Silly Movie... Hardly Feels Like an Indy Film,4,31 May 2008,"I'm afraid to say that the big wigs involved in the making of 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' may need to admit to themselves that they need to retire. This includes Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, Karen Allen (somebody, please tell her that she cannot act- that's why she hasn't been in a big movie since 'Raiders), and even George Lucas. And this is coming from a major Lucas fan and Lucas apologetic. But even this George fan has to admit when he has gone silly on us.What a ridiculous storyline. Aliens. UFOs. I know this is set in the 1950s, when extra-terrestrial life was a big phenomena, but come on. Indiana Jones should not be a science-fiction movie like this. Honestly, it made this film seem hardly like an Indiana Jones adventure. The shot of Ford, Allen and Shia LeBeouf looking at the UFO summed up how goofy this movie got to be.A big problem is Spielberg and Lucas' over-reliance on special effects. It makes memorable scenes like the ""creepy-crawly"" scenes that are part of what make the Indy movies famous seem so artificial. Same thing with the gruesome death. Where these scenes that are SO Indiana Jones seem organic because they are not computer generated from the 80s, these scenes now seem so artificial that they simply do not have the same effect on the emotions of the audience.Right now, I am asking for no more Indiana Jones movies. This one already leaves a somewhat bad taste in my mouth. I would much rather remember the last adventure of Indiana Jones as riding off into the sunset, rather than an anti-climactic scene in a squeaky-clean chapel.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
272,gregeichelberger,Well done until the end,6,20 May 2008,"Getting all (or most) of the principals from the first ""Indiana Jones"" film (1981) back together almost 30 years later was, in itself, no small undertaking for director Steven Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy and star Harrison Ford. After all, a lot of water (and body wrinkles) have come and gone under the bridge of time.I appreciated the fact that those individuals were willing to basically come out of retirement and give us another chapter in one of the great adventure franchises, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls."" I just wish the results would have been a little better.In fact, this tale of Jones going up against Russians, grave-guarding ninjas and various Indian tribes, was pretty good, holding my interest and earning big/action adventure points - that is until the conclusion when Spielberg went back to his pre-""Raiders"" (namely, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") personna.Even the inclusion of the annoying Mutt (Shia LaBeouf, ""Disturbia,"" ""Transformers""), who rides onto the screen looking like a bad Marlon Brando impersonator and smart talks his way through various scrapes with Jones, isn't terrible.Still, with a stellar cast including Karen Allen (as Marion Ravenwood from the first film), Cate Blanchett (the Russian psychic villain, Irina Spalko), John Hurt (Professor Oxley), Jim Broadbent (Dean Stanford) and Ray Winstone (George McHale), this movie features much of the same derring-do, unbelievable escapes and pseudo-religious charm of the first installments.Jones and cohorts not only try to dodge the evil Russians (it's now 1957), but also various wild animals, snakes, quicksand, carnivorous ants, nuclear explosions (this is 1957, after all), the FBI and interstellar deities, among other hazards. And, for the most part, it succeeds.Ford, at 70-plus, still looks great in the fedora and wields a mean bullwhip, although the Russians in 1957 were not quite the dark bad guys as the Nazis. Still, Blanchett makes a compelling femme fatale.The end, however, is too Spieldberg, when subtleness would have sufficed. It's a perfect lesson where less would be more, but, alas, the director did not ask my advice on the subject.Of course, no other such movie will come along without comparing it to the first. ""Raiders,"" despite no CGI effects, was one of the best films ever. It grabbed you, shook you up and threw you around for two hours and then dropped you back into your seat. None of the other versions could do this.""Kingdom of the Skulls"" starts out well, although not as intense, but ultimately comes up short. For me it's the third-best film, behind No. 1 and ""The Last Crusade.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
273,Chalice_Of_Evil,You vill enjoy this movie...,6,24 May 2008,"Well...maybe. Whether this fourth film lives up to your expectations depends on how high your expectations were to begin with. If you're expecting the movie to blow the other three out of the water, you'll surely be disappointed. If, however, you're just after a bit of escapism and haven't set an impossibly high standard to compare this film to...you should be marginally satisfied. There's nothing really ""bad"" about it as such, it's just not earth- shattering/groundbreaking in any way (though the film *does* have its fair share of ground breaking and earth shattering).As far as the cast goes, Harrison Ford does pretty good for a guy who should be taking things very slowly. He jumps, he punches, he performs death defying acts (that would cause others in his age bracket to have heart attacks) and he even teaches us that, in the event of a nuclear explosion, a fridge makes for excellent protection. As if that weren't enough, he survives going over a waterfall not once...not twice...but THRICE. Amazing! Still, you have give him credit, as he doesn't look *too* ridiculous (which is quite the feat to pull off). He still looks like the Indiana Jones we all know and love, with his signature whip, brown leather jacket and trusty fedora (which, somehow, always manages to find its way back to him like a boomerang, even after he's lost it), if a little worn out. Thankfully, they acknowledge the fact that Indy's no spring chicken anymore, but he doesn't let that stop him.Cate Blanchett has created a fairly memorable villain in her character of Irina Spalko. The most memorable thing about her (apart from her severe bob and the fact that she's pretty handy with a sword), however, has got to be that wandering accent of hers. For someone who usually puts on a flawless accent in every movie she's in - no matter what nationality - Cate's Russian accent does kind of fade in and out at times. Still, she gives us an enjoyable villain and shares some good scenes with Harrison Ford. Indy's new greaser sidekick, Mutt, is competently played by Shia LaBeouf. When he's not busy fussing over his hair, he's engaging Ms. Blanchett in swordplay (standing atop two moving vehicles at once) or swinging through the jungle on a vine ala Tarzan. Good thing PETA wasn't around, otherwise they would've gone after Mutt for using a snake as a rope.The supporting players consist of Mac, played by Ray Winstone (who, shockingly, looks nothing like Beowulf). He's certainly no substitute for John Rhys Davies' Sallah, from two of the earlier films, and only slightly less annoying than Short Round (from 'Temple of Doom'). Then there's the crazy old guy named Ox (you'd almost think you'd wandered onto a movie about farm animals, given all these odd types of names), played by John Hurt, who's rather grating. Lastly, but definitely not least, Karen Allen's back as Indy's love interest from the first film, Marion Ravenwood. These three don't really have so much to do in the film, and are kind of dead weight at times, but it's good to at least have Karen Allen back.The ""twist"" towards the end of the film (which I'm not sure you can even call a ""twist"" as such - given that the look of the Crystal Skull, from the movie's title, kind of telegraphs what the deal with it is early on) might leave some people scratching their heads as to just what Lucas/Spielberg were thinking. Although the ending does leave the door open for a possible future installment (with Shia LaBeouf's Mutt character taking on the mantel), Indy thankfully shows that he is having *none* of that and let's it be known he's still got a little more whip-cracking action left in him yet.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It was so far from what I expected out of the franchise. Paranormal happenings, heavy CGI, and a nonstop uppity score. The score was so in your face about how it wanted you to feel at any given second. Also, I cannot recall any other movie having such thick plot armor slapped onto its characters. On the positive side, the writer had fun with subverting expectations of the genre here and there, keeping things fresh.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

276,RogerMooreTheBestBond,Watching it for a second time made it better for me,8,23 September 2021,"This is the weakest of the 4 Indy films. I like Temple of Doom, Raiders, Last Crusade & then Skull. I agree with others that moving this to the 50's was a mistake. I guess they figured they had to move it forward because it had been almost 20 years between films. Harrison Ford was still in great shape. He did a great job returning as Indy. I did enjoy Cate Blanchett more this time than when I first saw it. Her wig really bothered me when I first saw it. Karen Allen did a fair job in a supporting role. John Hurt's role just did not work for me at all. His character was almost worthless to me. Shia Labeouf was the biggest surprise of all. He fit perfectly into the Indy universe. He was the perfect guy to play Indy's son. It's sad that the comments he made broke his relationship with the franchise. I don't totally disagree with him saying what he did, but it was probably bad timing. I think they could have made 2 or three more movies with him and Ford, but that time has passed. For the movie itself the beginning with the bomb test and the portrayal of people being over sensitive about commies was not needed. There was a real concern and still is for people that hate this country and are trying to destroy it from within this country. The ending with the spaceship was just not an Indiana Jones ending. Many have blamed Lucas for this. The best of the film is the middle of it. The journey and the great chemistry between Indy and Mutt. There is also some very good humor which I loved. The action sequences get and A+. I loved them! With that said, there was too much CGI. I hate CGI. The ants did not work for me. And some of the CGI shots during the chase were weak. I did love the very last scene where Indy and Marion got married. That was well done. Overall, I still give this an 8 for the two leads chemistry and the action scenes during the middle of the film. I think they should have stopped here. But they are now filming Indy 5 and Harrison Ford is nearly 80. No Spielberg, No Lucas and made by Disney. This might not work. Disney used to be great in the 1950's thru the 1970's. Now they can't even do right with Star Wars.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Well, unfortunately Koepp's screenplay is waaaaay off the mark here and Spielberg, Ford, and George Lucas, despite laughing all the way to the bank, heard it from die hard fans. Now in the 1950s, Indy is trying to stop the Soviets from getting their hands on the mysterious and powerful Crystal Skull. Fans would have been okay with resurrecting Indy if they would have left Shia LaBeouf's James Dean like character way out of the picture. If that character and the ending sequence absolutely had to be left in, I'm sure everyone would've been okay with Indy staying on the shelves for a little longer until something better came along in terms of a script.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

A couple of months ago i hadn't even seen a Indiana Jones film. The 4th one was coming out and i thought it looked good so i borrowed all 3 and loved them all. Now that i have seen all of them i will be going out and buying the box set of all 4 when it comes out. Now to what i thought of it.It had a great mix of adventure and humor. Indiana Jones is definitely back but this time with new characters and cgi.People have been whining about the cgi. But what do they expect. I thought the cgi worked very well and brought out awesome environments.Now people have been saying that this is like National Treasure. They are very wrong. This felt like a Indiana Jones movie but it had a few changes.The acting was great. Harrison Ford still owns the role. Shia Labeouf was very surprising and didn't bother me at all. Karen Allen seems to have lost it a bit since the first but was still good.Just sit back and enjoy it. I recommend it.

282,AdrenalinDragon,It just didn't feel right...,5,22 May 2008,"I had high hopes for this movie to turn out well, but it just became a bothering the whole time. I loved the original trilogy of the Indiana Jones movies but this one was just I guess you could say ""Mediocre""? or ""It's just not the same as the old ones"" I think the first problem I had with it, was realising that Harrison Ford was just too old for Indiana Jones now. I mean its been what 20 years since the 3rd movie, and at places I felt if the movie was made 10 years ago perhaps I could've been more excited about seeing him on screen. They made the plot fit in with the aging but it was still an odd feeling. Don't get me wrong, his character portrayed in this movie is still quite true like the originals, but it was left too late in my opinion.The next big problem, was the overuse of CGI. Without giving too much away, the ending part of the movie was absolutely overused and it made me go something like ""It's Star Wars Episode 1 all over again"". Seriously, the old Indiana Jones movies did have special effects but they were not as distracting as this. One of the problems with revisiting an old movie series and modernizing it is that it loses that spark and makes you realise that movies are just trying too hard nowadays and it gets worse year after year.A lot of scenes which weren't really needed, the CGI could have been avoided or used more appropriately in places, and the acting was fairly good I felt Cate Blanchett's role was well played, but the guy Shia LaBeouf was kind of annoying in places and the plot was fairly predictable but I liked the concept because it was appropriately placed.Overall, I was disappointed and felt like saying it shouldn't have been made. Although the movie is still entertaining and does have its moments, this Indiana Jones movie no way tops the original three, and despite good use of theme music and settings, I felt Spielberg could have done better but I guess its kind of hard after reviving a movie series from 20 years ago. Please don't make another sequel, or don't use Harrison Ford again if it happens!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
283,jemps918,Almost only lukewarm,7,22 May 2008,"I barely remember the first three Indiana Jones movies, so some of the obvious allusions to previous missing characters were lost on me. But I was hoping to still appreciate this fourth installment as a stand alone flick, especially after reading all the positive reviews on it.The opening scene of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull set the tone for the first half of the flick, which was a treat; classic Lucas/Spielberg. The casting is also pretty clever, and it's great to see Harrison Ford still in tiptop shape and still oozing with charm. Cate Blanchett as the villain is played out on cue as expected, and Shia LeBouf wasn't too shabby either.But I wasn't floored. I guess I expected too much, but the crossover to a Roswell theme didn't quite fit so seamlessly for me. Then there were all those unbelievable situations our characters encounter but unlike similar films like The Mummy, National Treasure and the Da Vinci Code, there just wasn't enough humor or witty repartee to go around. It played out safe and despite the longish action sequences, almost desensitizing the audience in some parts. There just aren't any surprises to keep the audience enthralled, and the lackluster ending was disappointing, almost unfair; taking the audience somewhere only to leave them hanging--and not in a good, I-want-some-more way.The saving grace? The infectious Indy theme. Oh, and, the ever bankable Harrison Ford.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Is it too slow, does it compare to the other legends in trilogy, the over-done action sequences and aliens. But the second viewing i had when watching this film all those things above didn't come to mind whatsoever, and i was completely bellowed with excitement and full throttle adventure. A lot of people have been slating this movie as not a proper Indie film, or that it's too far fetched e.g. surviving an atomic bomb in a fridge. Okay this tiny element put into the film may be a bit far fetched but thats what Indiana Jones films are meant to be like, 1930'serial action adventure films. All the cast did a kick-ass job of sticking with comedy and action. Ando before i go any further Indiana Jones's age doesn't come into this film. I couldn't even recognise his ageing.The action sequences were mind blowing and total classic Indiana Jones. The different shades of the beautiful photography all gave resemblance and character to the locations and classic settings of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. To conclude what i have said. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a must-see Indiana Jones film, full of action and adventure at every level.

Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is now on the search for the Crystal Skull - an ancient artifact that is said to possess strange powers and come from some alien planet.This time he brings along young greaser Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) and his old friend Mac (Ray Winstone), as they race to find the skull before Soviet Irina (Cate Blanchett) can use it for evil purposes. Also along for the adventure - once again - is Indy's old love interest Marion (Karen Allen), who has a secret of her own.If you're a fan of the original ""Indiana Jones"" movies, then this is right up your alley.

An interesting twist on the alien-seeding thesis. A decent 1950's rumble. Lots of humor.

289,kyle-cruse,Far better than anticipated,8,10 September 2008,"I tend to worry about a film when I don't start seeing previews for it until just a month or two before the film is released, usually meaning that the producers do not care enough about the film to promote it much ahead of time. Nevertheless, there was nothing to worry about with this film. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" proved to be very entertaining and deserving of a spot in the Indiana Jones saga. Harrison Ford was not too old to play his role again, as I feared he would be. He manages to throw in just as many wisecracks as before and come off with the same feel as he did in the previous three films. This addition takes place in the fifties, so this time it is the Russians rather than the Nazis who are after the treasure. The female leader of this Russian group, played fairly well by Cate Blanchett, manages to provide a good enough villain for Jones in this film. Shia LaBeouf gives a performance that manages to far outweigh his fairly poor one in ""Transformers,"" which is good, since he was one reason I feared this film may not be a hit. Some drawbacks include the rather violent and unappealing battle scenes toward the end, in addition to the scenes in which red ants manage to torture some bad guys to death. Nevertheless, this is a very enjoyable film, third best in the series (behind ""The Last Crusade"" and ""Raiders"" but definitely better than ""Temple of Doom""). It's too bad Sean Connery couldn't have been brought back for this film, but maybe that wouldn't have worked anyway.

290,faraaj-1,Definitely a part of the series,6,28 May 2008,"You can't stop people from whining! If there was never another Indy film after Last Crusade, they would've regretted never being able to see an older Indy in a farewell tribute to the series. When that tribute comes, they say its not good enough! First off, it is good enough. This is no Phantom Menace or Godfather 3 where you wait for decades and get something that is far below the standard of the original.Indy 4 is visually and thematically a part and parcel of this excellent series. Roger Ebert said something to the effect that its the same sausage but the first bite is always the tastiest. Indy 4 has corny one-liners, cheesy action and historic babble, but then so did its three predecessors. The film is entertaining from the word go and very intelligently done. It updates the setting from the late 30's to the 50's and the visual transition is brilliantly handled from the opening scene. It also pays homage to many of the classic Indy moments - the one I liked most was the motorbike scene where Ford acted like Connery and Shia like Ford.The action scene are wildly improbable and fun to watch. I remember watching the first three films as a kid and young teenage and it was edge of the seat stuff. While watching Indy 4 in the cinema last night, I remember thinking the action was well handled but it wasn't intellectually stimulating (like Tarkovsky or Kubrick)! Then I looked at my five and a half year old son sitting in the seat next to me and he was on the edge of his seat and having a whale of a time! Honestly, the first three movies came out at a different time and age. The only thing Indy 4 can't deliver is my youth (or Connery unfortunately). It really can't be faulted on any other count. By the way, Shia LeBoeuf (who I've never seen before) is quite good. He reminded me of James Dean from East of Eden and Brando from The Wild One.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
291,springsunnywinter,The Looney Tunes Version,5,19 May 2008,"Although many of Steven Spielberg's films are all time classics including Jaws, E.T, Jurassic Park and of course the Indiana Jones trilogy, but it seems that he has lost his touch with this one. I'm not a huge fan of Indiana Jones but I liked the first two films not the third one and he is probably one of the greatest movie character. I felt that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was just made to please the fans although their was no need the forth part and the trilogy was enough.The story was quite poor for a 2 hour movie and the biggest flaw is the film was far too unrealistic that was beginning to feel like a non animated cartoon. In cartoons like Looney Tunes an anvil falls on a character and they go flat but they are o.k. which is the same in this film e.g. a jeep falls on their jeep and they are o.k. even if they fall down a waterfall 3 times.Overall it was watchable not wonderful and would've work in the early 90s but we are a lot past that and a sequel after about 20 years don't work just like the rubbish Rambo also the actor becomes really old and looks like that he is just about to break his hip.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Despite being the weakest in the series, it's a very enjoyable and eye-filling, long-lost sequel in the Indiana Jones-franchise, now set in the 1950s with loads of amusing time era references and gags. Matinée spirit intact most of the way, it's speedy & creepy in the right places with a new bunch of memorable characters- Hurt & Blanchett in particular-, some Jones family disclosures and good action bits (although the jungle chase is mostly a CGI-video game). Also, Spielberg's life-long flirt with aliens & UFO:s comes to a nicely fitting round-up in the impressive climax, indeed.The most personally disappointing moment, though, is that Karen Allen's returning character Marion Ravenwood is sadly not used to her advantage, as she's roughly treated as a prop here. Even the ending, most definitely involving her, doesn't ring true, where the high cuteness factor also tries your patience a bit far...So, 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

(subjective), NOT Great !",7,28 May 2008,"Take an All-Star cast, a Profound Director and Cinematographer, and put it with a so-so Script, you get a Good ?(subjective), not Great film, tolerable and somewhat palatable, but could have BEEN much, much better.The film is PURELY plot driven, with no real sense of story development. Henry Jones. Jr,/Indiana(Harrison Ford) is back, as the aged veteran College Professor/Archaeologist Extradonaire, in this Extravaganza of the Search for the Crystal Skull, why, what are it's values, well, that is one of the downfalls of the film, it fails to extract and build upon these themes.,, too bad,had Spielberg done that, it could have reached the same lofty status as Indy films 1 and 3. Still, it is a fun and action filled, for the most part, a study into alleged ancient Peruvian culture.There are too many facts to fill in the background, but suffice it to say, that one of Jones's colleagues, had found the Crystal Skull, and now the search is on to find him, Professor Oxley(John Hurt), and regain the Skull, and restore it to it's rightful owners,or geographic location.So there it is, helping him along the way is Mutt Williams(Shia Lebouf), kind of a sidekick throwback to the days when superheroes had sidekicks, and the return of Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen), after a 26 year absence,whew, almost too many characters, there is more.Irina Spalko(Kate Blanchett), Russian Super Agent, who has no fear or mercy when it comes to achieving her agenda, well played. And there is one more character/plot device, that keeps this list growing,""Mac"" George McHale(Ray Winstone), who is a Double-Agent or is it a Triple Agent, at this point, it doesn't really matter, because he is only there to keep the plot moving forward.Excellent Stuntwork and Fantastic Sets are the Hallmark of this film, while the CG is overdone in some parts, and so is the Suspension of Disbelief after the 3rd waterfall. Another fault of the film is that the series of chases and action scenes , do not build to a super climax, the sum of the parts is less than the whole, Quantum Physics, it is not.It was almost like they were thinking lets do this, and then this, and then throw in ALLOT of CGI, and then lets try this, VERY contrived.But, that being said, I am not trying to find fault, just point out that it could have been much better co-ordinated, after almost 20 years since the last film. Maybe Lucas and Spielberg are running out of steam, which would be sad.Apparently, George Lucas overruled another script selected by Spielberg, which was a BIG mistake, Lucas is losing his status from a film maverick to a sell-out.So, if you see this film, be aware that it is not Indy 1 or 3, better than 2, but not by much. I gave it a 7, once again I gave Spielberg the benefit of the doubt when no new clips but the previews were advertised for the film, which is usually a bad sign, next time I just won't go.Try to see it at the LOWEST price possible, so you feel you are getting more value for your money, or watch the first and third Indy films again, what REAL story telling is all about.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
294,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""",6,22 May 2008,"I'm kinda partial on this one. While this may not be the best Indiana Jones movie, it sure is a worthy addition to the successful franchise. Harrison Ford's age definitely shows but it didn't stop him one bit. He still, at 65 years of age, pulled off those high flying stunts and action scenes. Cate Blanchett was awesome. That's all I can say. Her performance as villainess Irina Spalko was near perfection. From her gray dominatrix get-up, her mean looking rapier and that accent. Oh my gosh. She's so beautiful. This is actually the first time that I kinda sided with the antagonists. With a hot boss like that, who wouldn't side with the Russians eh? And alas there's the new kid on the block Shia LaBeouf. His performance was quite okay. I mean, it was like watching him in Transformers once again and he's mastered his field in such short time.The only problem is, this film has got the ""War of the Worlds"" thing going on here. Upon watching you ask yourself (or the person next to you) what the hell is going on. What is he doing? Did that just happen? How come he's alive? What is that thing? How the hell did that person reach point B from point A? and the list of never ending questions goes on and on forever. If you've seen the also Steven Spielberg flick War of the Worlds, you know what I'm talking about. Indiana Jones 4 is loaded with action scenes (the most notable is the jungle car chase scene), a nice touch of humor courtesy of Shia's character Mutt and the familial ties: dad Indiana Jones, mom Marion Ravenwood and son Henry Jones III. I'll leave it up to you who might the kid be *cough*Shia*cough* 6/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
295,David_Frames,"""Don't look at it, don't look at it whatever happens.""",4,24 May 2008,"Do the people who defined popular culture have a license to destroy it? This is a minor philosophical diversion you may want to use to centre yourself during this belated and unnecessary bolt on to the Indiana Jones series. It isn't a film at all so much as a deliberate and sinister act of cultural vandalism.Why was it made? Putting aside the fatuous nonsense Ford and co. have vomited out at press junkets, nostalgia fed self-indulgence seems to be the motive. Three sixty-somethings, pillows stuffed with laurels, have collaborated, perhaps with some sense of desperation on Ford's part, to relive past glories. This was the screenplay, we're led to believe, that they all agreed was the best out of the many versions produced over the years. David Koep's effort is so anaemic however, that it simply beggars belief that this was the superior treatment. The reality is that his clunky, unwieldy discharge of a script - a Frankenstein collage of previous (and one suspects superior and more coherent) drafts was a compromise between director, star and producer  disagreements between which kept this one in development hell for two decades. Once you've seen the finished product you will rue the day they settled their differences.Clearly the will to make the movie was greater that the need to get it right. Consequently what's made it to the screen is conspicuously and unforgivably deficient in the elements that made the original movies the gold standard for this type of action adventure. David Koep, fumbling to adapt a story from George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson, might have deserved a greater share of the blame were it not for the notorious and disastrous interventionism of Lucas, who famously binned a draft from the Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont and was determined to saddle the film with Ed Wood style b-movie stupidity. Koep's inheritance of this poison chalice, making him the Walter Donovan of those who stepped up to pen this sequel, has nothing to do with aptitude in crafting 120 pages of platinum movie fuel, more his pliable tendency as a hack for hire who'd be unlikely to fight his corner when faced with Lucas' imbecilic vetoes. The finished film is flabby, awkward and overcooked, not least in the absurd nuclear opener. The Fifties b-movie cues are all present and correct  flying saucers, the red peril and the aforementioned atomic threat but they're integrated with variable success and although its better made than its progenitors its not always better executed. This is a movie that runs on with everyone both behind and in front of the camera trying to ape the style and tone of old but not being quite able to remember how they did it. Spielberg hasn't shot in this aspect ratio for many a moon and it shows. Compositions lack depth and inventiveness, as though he wasn't sure how to fill the screen  astonishing given his talent and experience, and the editing, so precise in the previous three pictures, is slapdash in places, rendering such sequences confusing with some shots poorly matched. But with Indy movies the film is just half the picture. The other  John Williams' score, is as much a character as any on screen and unfortunately he's a match for most of the one dimensional supporting cast in this installment. His effort is anonymous, continuing a downward trajectory that began in the early nineties and shows no sign of recovery here. With not one memorable cue, Williams appears to be following contemporaries like Jerry Goldsmith who were once masters of big orchestral compositions but settled into self-plagiarism and melodic schizophrenia. Williams is of course alive, unlike poor Goldsmith but this score wouldn't pass mustard as proof of life following a kidnap. Much of what we hear sounds like a random collection of notes looking for a tune and that's a shame because an on form Williams might have elevated the proceedings, not least in the interminable middle section. This second act lags and is laden with exposition rather than incident. Film students will appreciate the lesson from the most successful filmmaker in the world in how not to sustain audience interest but the rest of us will wonder what happened to Spielberg's red pencil as we're treated to scene after scene in which Koep's screenplay tells us what's going on without troubling itself to show it.The cast is variable, with Ford occasionally good value as a long in the tooth Indy. Too often however he looks slow and stilted and the supporting cast give him nothing to spark off. The real tragedy however is a reanimated Karen Allen, looking as if she'd just stepped out of a Beverley Hills Plastic Surgeons and given little to do but looks startled. Her rebooted Marion Ravenwood bares no resemblance to the character of old and her presence seems forced, which it is as it's a device to introduce Shia Labeouf's heir apparent  Mutt Williams. There's a joke there somewhere  Indy named himself after the family dog and his son has given himself a pet moniker too but that's about as subtle as the new film gets. For a movie allegedly made for the fans, the irony is that Crystal Skull delivers the, er, nuclear family many of them would have seen in their worst nightmares. It's exactly the film you'd have expected a sentimental and egregious Hollywood machine to have made when tailoring a blockbuster to its imagined family audience but Spielberg should know better and the syrup drenched ending should be a colossal embarrassment for all concerned.A lyric from the Elvis song that opens the film is neat shorthand for what follows; ""You said you were high classed, well that was just a lie."" Indy fans will wonder how they ever fell for it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
296,jdring2007,mindless fun if you accept the outlandish concept and stupid lack of realism,7,4 June 2021,"This one really needs you to switch off your brain to enjoy it. As much as an ""alien guy"" as I am, it definitely had to grow on me. The refrigerator scene pretty much made me hate it the first time around, but that's because I didn't realize they were shifting gears the way The Fast and the Furious did when they introduced the Rock. Yeah, it's ridiculous and unrealistic and kind of stupid. But, it looks nice. The stunts are great, the editing is great, the action is silly at times but great, and most of the humor lands. I just wish they'd spent more on the ""alien mythology""; the clues leading up to the finale felt like a 90s video game, but okay. I'd press for a high 6, low 7.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
297,moutonbear25,Cracking whips or hips?,7,25 May 2008,"The latest Indiana Jones installment opens with an impromptu drag race in the middle of the Nevada desert. (It actually opens with a silly, fake gopher making a face at the camera but that is far too bizarre for me to comment on.) A car full of teenagers, looking 50's fresh, pass a number of army trucks full of troops. When they get to the front of the line, they encourage the army driver across from them to step on the gas and they're off. In many ways, this opening sequence announces the tone for what's to come in Steven Spielberg's INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. The image is crisp; the camera movement is slick; and the thrills are swept up into momentary exhilaration. But then, as the cavalcade turns off the road and the teenagers continue on into the desert, it becomes clear that the entire sequence was speeding toward nothing at all.It is 1957 and nearly twenty years since Indy's last adventure, mirroring the same amount of time between the last film and this one. Both Indy and the man who first incarnated him in 1981, Harrison Ford, are in their 60's now. Still, as Indy hops from towering to teetering crate in an army hanger and swings into a truck with his trusty whip secured against the rafters, it's clear that his face may be weathered but this old guy's still pretty spry. Indy has managed to get himself caught by the KGB, led by Cate Blanchett in a razor sharp, black bob as Irina Spalko. She needs his expertise to find a body that she hopes will then lead her to a crystal skull. Legend has it, as it tends to in Indiana movies, that the one who returns the crystal skull to its proper resting place will have infinite knowledge bestowed upon them. This would give this person the ability to know the thoughts of every person on earth and the ability to manipulate these thoughts. I can barely control my own thoughts so I doubt I could handle that kind of responsibility but the Russians seem pretty convinced that they would do just fine.Indy also has a new adventuring partner, 21-year-old Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). Casting Shia as the rebel without a cause (I may have swooned every time he unnecessarily ran his comb through his perfect pompadour) may have been an easy decision to ensure a younger crowd or to take some o the stunt pressure off Ford but either way, it works. As usual, Shia brings an unimposing depth to popcorn fare and, in this case, some great chemistry between him and Ford. Bringing in fresh blood or modernizing in general can be tricky when you're also trying to honour tradition. The dynamic between Indy & Mutt (as well as the return of Karen Allen as Indy's first squeeze, Marion Ravenwood) allows for the cheesy one-liners to flourish but the loss of Douglas Slocombe as cinematographer (he died in 2004) has practically removed the classical Hollywood style that made some of the more ridiculously implausible Indy moments bearable, if not campily enjoyable. Spielberg's regular cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, is certainly a genius but the only classical element remaining is a soft focus to keep Indy looking as young as possible. The result is at times breathtaking but fundamentally less authentic.There is no question that Indiana Jones is a cinematic icon, from his hat and whip to John Williams's triumphant score. The danger with reviving the character after such a long period is that you run the risk of tarnishing one of Hollywood's most celebrated action heroes. If you're going to take that risk, there had better be a good reason. The premise and ultimate conclusion of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL leave you with some brilliant imagery, wavering levels of excitement and a nagging question as to whether this was the best they could come up with after twenty years. Indy does entertain with relatively little disappointment but while his latest adventure doesn't kill the franchise, it does nothing for it either. Anyway, Spielberg best not wait another twenty years before the next installment. If he does, Indy will be a lot more likely to be cracking hips than whips.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
298,vailsy,too much cgi means this Indy doesn't fit with the other 3,6,25 May 2008,"This film was unlikely to be a classic like Raiders, but since it's probably Ford's last outing as Indiana Jones you can't really blame them for getting a bit sentimental, mushy and gratuitous but..Unfortunately the movie is seriously lacking in atmosphere. In South America in particular, where we spend most of our time, the scenes have been put together almost entirely in the studio. At no point did I feel like I was there. In the other movies you could almost taste the atmosphere because most of it was shot on locationSo gone is the awesome stunt work for which Indiana Jones movies are renowned for, replaced with cgi and blue screensThe film also includes poor filler scenes with 'cartoon-ish' animals, and relentlessly pushes ahead plot-wise with the characters magically making it from one extremely important location to the nextLikewise, the audio is so focused on details that the larger ambient picture is missed entirely. During a Peruvian street scene for example, we have music playing that sounds like its coming from a mix cd in a luxury spa rather than a rickety market place. Overall the sound offers no surprises and lots of the effects are hammy, especially during the sword fight scene which sounds like they're fighting with dustbin lids!The result is that the film seems claustrophobic, perfectly staged, predictable. There are lots of throw-away performances, especially Winston's, and the movie really just coasts alongDespite all this it's a reasonably enjoyable romp and is worth watching once for nostalgia. Just a shame it wasn't made ten or fifteen years sooner, before heavy cgi found favour amongst senior film makers and crew who don't want to get dirty anymore!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
299,mirwais-orbit,Something is missing. What could it be?,5,17 June 2008,"It's 5 minutes that I left the theater and I feel... I feel that something is missing, and I could see the same feeling at people's face when I looked at them exactly when the lights were turned on. I remember that I grew up watching Indiana Jones series and that time was one of the best time for me ever. No matter how much I couldn't understand Raiders Of The Lost Ark and that Nazi thing at 6, no matter how much I enjoyed so much The Temple Of Doom and those people eating monkey brains at 8, and no matter how much I expected about The Last Cruzade at 10. Indiana Jones stills being the best series for me ever, because it is a living part of my life as a child and as a movie lover.But I think that 19 years is a long time waiting for a fourth installment. And it was. It was because after 19 years Indiana Jones became some kind of culture, some kind of untouchable treasure. A myth. And being a myth it's hard to see it in a different way as we knew before. It was hard for me to see a 60 y.o. Indiana Jones making jokes that doesn't fit anymore, or Marion Ravenwood yelling at him not as we have in our memories, seeing both of them that way it's something like seeing an 80 y.o. Marilyn Monroe, if you know what I mean.Not just that. Action movies had a huge transformation during all these 19 years. The differences between Indiana Jones time and Transformers time is visible in the screen with The Kingdom Of Crystal Skull. This 4th Indy adventure feels out of date because it was shot like the old times, I mean... not so much CGI, real stunts, great scenarios, close shots, huge locations and a linear plot. It was a great idea, but it doesn't feels natural and fluid as the old ones because Spielberg and Lucas were so worried about the expectation and the mine field they were going into that they tried to make it as much perfect as they could, and we know that when anything tries a lot to be perfect, it brakes. And I feel sad about that because the best thing about Indiana Jones is that it was always loose and spontaneous, things that I think are missing here.For the best everyone gave for this movie, I couldn't feel all nostalgic I though I would feel when the movie began as I felt, for example, with Superman. As I said... 19 years is a long time waiting. 19 years is a so long time that ""waiting"" is very close to ""CONFORM"", and I think that a lot of people was so comfort with the conformation that bringing Indiana Jones back from its sacred place wasn't a so great idea right now, maybe it would had been 10 or 15 years back.The plot is the weakest plot of all series, even comparing to the nonsense of The Temple Of Doom. Even the 2nd adventure being the most criticized movie from most of the fans, it stills being one of the best ones just for some classical moments that will be in our memories forever. And that was THE THING about Indiana Jones, its classical moments like Indy running away from a giant stone or simply for the intelligent dialogs between him and his friends. All these things are missing, the movie is just popcorn without fun.We all know that the 4th adventure had milions of plots and drafts until its final version, and is that really serious that this one was the best one? So... after this question I get myself right now thinking how bad the bad one should be.Anyway, I liked because I could feel just a little spark of that so great childhood time, but it was just a spark, it was not an entire movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

301,seaview1,Indiana Jones Rides Again in THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL,8,27 May 2008,"The question that begs to be asked is if the latest installment of Indiana Jones is any good? The answer is yes, and one needn't fret over another letdown like The Phantom Menace, which undermined the original Star Wars trilogy. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, far from perfect, gets the job done and carries on its tradition of high adventure in satisfying fashion.In 1957 Nevada, mysterious soldiers persuade Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford) to locate an important crate amidst a large warehouse of X-Files type of treasures. A ruthless Russian, Irinia Spalko (Cate Blanchett), leads her troops in an obsessive search for a mythic, crystal skull of unknown origin that may have potential psychic powers if it is joined with other skulls hidden in a lost city in the South American jungle. Meanwhile at his college, Professor Jones meets young 'Mutt' Williams (Shia LaBeouf) who needs Indy's help to rescue his mentor, Dr. Oxley, and his mom, Marion. It seems they, too, have been hunting for the skull. Pursued by Russian agents, Indiana and Mutt attempt to rescue their comrades while discovering clues about the crystal skull. During the journey, certain truths emerge, and Indy must confront his past and a former love. As Irina closes in, who will survive when the enigmatic skulls are reunited and unleash their hidden, unworldly power? The screenplay by David Koepp cobbles previous stories and ideas from a battery of writers. While it has more heart than any Lara Croft film by far, one wishes that original writer, Lawrence Kasdan, had a final rewrite to punch up the emotional content to compliment the action. I do like, however, that they tease you with the possibility that Mutt may or may not be Indy's son and if Indy will 'get the girl'. Bravo to the filmmakers for confronting these issues head on by story's end.Harrison Ford may be 65 years of age, but he looks great and does most of his own stunts! (To put things in perspective, John Wayne was 62 in True Grit and Cary Grant was 59 in Charade.) Shia LaBeouf is more than able as his new sidekick with a greased comb and an attitude, and Karen Allen is most welcome as Marion, able to take charge and hold her own. Cate Blanchett is appropriately sinister and alluring as the deadly Irina. Unfortunately other talents are not well developed, leaving in its lurch, John Hurt as Oxley, Jim Broadbent as a college dean, and Ray Winstone as an older sidekick with his own agenda.While Raiders of the Lost Ark had countless, memorable action scenes, this film has a few of its own. There are the usual barrage of bloodless shootouts, fistfights, and bits of customary nastiness with bugs, snakes and skeletons not to mention the exciting climax where you just know the greedy, evil commies will get theirs. Naturally, some of the scenes strain credibility in being quite implausible and unrealistic (as in plunging from a waterfall or two or three), but it is all in good fun. The hair raising escapes are like a well oiled machine particularly in an exhilarating but impossible chase in the jungle as major characters leap among three, count 'em three moving vehicles! And if it feels like parts of the story seem familiar, keep in mind that the filmmakers are paying homage to the Saturday morning serials of their youth. Other referenced movies come to mind like Forbidden Planet and Journey to the Center of the Earth.Production values are top notch. Veteran composer John Williams rekindles the musical cues, and Michael Kahn's editing pushes the limits of nail biting suspense. A couple scenes look a little sloppy and don't come off as well as they should, and although there are some slow spots with confusing dialogue and murky exposition, there is always a marvelously choreographed action scene waiting around the corner. For example, the opening sequence is vintage Indiana Jones as Spielberg builds up a grand entrance for his star and puts him in immediate peril. Later, there is an anxious moment when Jones is about to be caught in an atomic blast and must use his wits to survive. What has always made the character so likable is that he is fallible. Even Indy's mistakes and hiccups can be humorous and exciting, as evidenced in a sinking pit where he must come to grips with a childhood fear.Lucas and Spielberg proved that lightning could strike three times in a row in the 1980's (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade), and now they have done it a fourth time. I put this film on par with the later chapters. Viewers who keep in mind how the 1950's timeline lends itself to more science fiction elements, will understand that, while every Indy saga ends with a supernatural event, this one is grounded in the 'watch the skies' frame of mind. It is this conceit that may throw off a few fans of the older films.The door is left open for more adventures, but the film does wrap things in a neat bow. You wish that they would just leave well enough alone and gracefully end on a high note. Indeed, the last, parting shots are terrific for fans. As with the previous chapters, this film is likely to improve with repeated viewings. I seem to recall liking the first one and then savoring it considerably more over time. Indiana Jones ages like fine wine. Drink up.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
302,michael_the_nermal,It was a bit too much,6,1 September 2008,"Warning! MAJOR spoiler alert!This is the *only* ""Indiana Jones"" I've seen end to end, so I cannot comment on the franchise. Alone ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" featured fine acting by Harrison Ford (who impressed me in the ""Star Wars"" franchise as a credible action hero), decent acting by most of the supporting cast, but a plot so goofy I simply couldn't fully enjoy this movie.Karen Allen and Shia LeBouef are good (Allen and Ford have some terrific romantic tension; the bickering scenes looked fun to watch). Cate Blanchett was a bit too cartoony for my tastes as the Russian villain; you could clearly hear her Australian accent underneath that god-awful Russian accent she affected. My favorite supporting character is the bewitched archaeologist colleague of Indy's, Dr. Oxley, who is wonderful to watch in his wet serape and stringy beard as he crazily inc-ants ancient Maya songs. I liked the comical and cartoonish action scenes, though Shia LeBouef imitating Tarzan just seemed a little too clichéd for me. The Soviet ""jungle-cutter"" was a very cool fantasy vehicle.The plot, on the other hand, was simply some junk torn straight from ""Chariot of the Gods!"", a now-discredited pseudo-science book about how Maya hieroglyphics and the Egyptian pyramids are proof positive that aliens taught humanity everything they know. The origin of the Crysal Skull is extremely lame. The public sees Indiana Jones as the face of archaeology (I understand the public obviously doesn't think archaeologists are like Indiana Jones; still, real archaeologists, for whatever reason, like to contrast their work with the bull-whipping antics of Indy. No joke: as a grad student in the humanities, a person living across the hall in my dorm thought I was going to be like Indiana Jones---and I think he was pretty earnest), albeit with a huge dose of fantasy and fiction; but the Crystal Skull and the aliens were way too fantastic for my tastes. I must castigate Spielberg for daring to lift the basic concepts of ""Chariot of the Gods!"" for his movie. It gives archaeology a bad name in the public sphere! Overall, the movie is a good popcorn film, but nothing more. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen look remarkably well-preserved and youthful for their age (did Indy and Marion go on a quest for The Fountain of Youth while the public wasn't looking?). I recommend it, and hopefully you will be more open-minded and less serious about the whole Crystal Skull plot than I was when I saw this movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

305,Scaramouche2004,Why all the bad reviews????,8,24 May 2008,"Indiana Jones was an icon of the 80's and an icon of my childhood. As a character it has to be said that with the exception of Captain Jack Sparrow, never before or since has such an iconic and legendary character been created that has had such an impact on movie going audiences.For this reason the character was never officially retired and although nearly twenty years have passed since Indy's last great adventure, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford have spent that hiatus trying to agree on the best plot, script, cast etc. in order to bring a new Indiana Jones vehicle to the screen.It was an unfortunate coincidence however that the finished article had to be released when it was because although this movie has been long awaited by fans, it appears to many that Lucas and Spielberg have simply jumped on the current bandwagon which has seen other 80's relics such as John McLaine, Rocky Balboa and John Rambo also casting away their zimmer frames, taking off their cardies and slippers and acting like a group of twenty year olds.So although this movie was always planned and envisaged, if you take into account the time elapsed since The Last Crusade and this trend of 80's nostalgia characters, this film becomes a revival piece by default.First I was excited at the prospect of a new Indiana Jones movie, but became disheartened by the bad reviews I had read. I expected to leave the cinema with a distinct feeling of anti-climax never able to look at Indy in the same light again. In short I was expecting the biggest turkey ever. Thankfully that was not the case.It occurred to me midway into the film that the people who have panned it probably didn't get it. They were probably not around or old enough to appreciate the original trilogy first hand or maybe it's because as they have only been spoon-fed a singular movie diet of CGI blockbusters, slashers and horrors for the last twenty years, their tastes, attitudes or expectations have changed alarmingly since 1989. Or maybe simply because this genre of film has been away from our screens so long people have just forgotten how to appreciate them.So with so many bad reviews its about time I go out on a limb and defend it with justifiable gusto.This film is great and thoroughly entertaining. Its quite right that it doesn't contain the epic spectacle of Raiders of the Lost Ark or the dark plot line of Temple of Doom, nor is it quite the thrilling roller coaster ride of The Last Crusade, but it none the less an exciting and befitting chapter thats fits in well with The Indiana Jones legend.This time we see a much older and slower Indy, embroiled in a KGB plot to find and acquire some apparent extra terrestial artifacts, whilst being reunited with former lover Marion Ravenwood and her son Mutt, a switchblade loving biker boy and Fonz wannabee, who turns out to be....well you can guess the rest.The search leads them to Peru where the site of an old Inca temple reveals a supernatural history of its own.Aliens? Flying saucers? Is this for real? Is somebody having a giraffe? Yeah, I thought the same thing when I first heard about it, but in reality is a flying saucer anymore of a fantasy than a seven hundred year old knight in a cave full of cups? An Ark full to the brim with the power of God, or five magical stones that decide the fate and prosperity of a village? The Indy films have always had a supernatural edge to them, whether this be based on faith, or the occult, so to incorporate a science fiction twist to that edge was after all a logical step. And despite what your mind conjours it is done both tastefully and in line with the films plot.There are some unbelievable moments here like the nuclear fridge routine and the survival of going over three major waterfalls all of which made Niagra look like a dripping tap, and in hindsight these scenes should have probably been rewritten or just cut from the movie altogether.But its great to see Indy back in the swing of things, notably older and more cautious, conscious of his age and the era in which he now lives. It was also nice to have explained some of the things which Indiana Jones has been doing these last twenty years, including his OSS service during World War II for which he was highly decorated and awarded the rank of Colonal.It also mentions the passing of both Marcus Brody and his father which helps to tie up the loose ends from the previous picture and once again emphasises the passing of time...a major factor in the film.I went to the cinema expecting the worst, instead I got...not the best by a long margin, but a film on par with the others and a far, far better experience than I could have hoped for.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
306,carologletree,"Quite Easily the Worst of the Indiana Jones Series, but not Terrible by Any Means",6,16 January 2016,"I had actually seen this film before I had ever seen the original three. I thought it was really good the first time I watched it, but after I watched the original three and re-watched this, it's kind of a mixed bag. It is definitely the worst of the series, but it still has some going for it.First off, the story was kind of weird. Sure, the other three films had some otherworldly themes, but I think having an artifact involving aliens is a little out there.I felt that Kate Blanchett's Irina Spalko was a very poor villain. She was quite boring and her character was bland and just not interesting at all. Also, Shia LaBeouf, who plays Indy's son, Mutt, is sometimes a pretty cool character, but he can also be quite annoying at times. He came off as kind of a spoiled brat.I could talk about the infamous fridge scene and some other weird scenes in this film, but I'd be treading ground that so many other people already have.However, the film does have its strengths. Harrison Ford, although much older, is still very convincing as Indiana Jones. The scene where he is introduced is awesome. It just makes you say, ""welcome back, my man."" I also thought it was nice to see Marion Ravenwood again. Mac was a pretty amusing character, with his constant double-crosses.The special effects in this film may be overblown, but the action still delivers. In particular, the chase scene leading to the crystal skull's temple was very well done.Indy and Marion getting married in the end was pretty cool, and I liked how Mutt looked at Indy's hat, possibly foreshadowing that he could follow in his father's footsteps.This movie definitely didn't need to be made, as ""The Last Crusade"" wrapped everything up so perfectly. This is easily the worst of the series, but at least it's a better fourth installment than, say, ""Terminator Salvation."" This is still a pretty entertaining film and still worth a look if you are a die-hard Indiana Jones fan.RATING: C+",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
307,ab-2,"""Indy"" May Not Be ""Crystal,"" but it's a Fun Ride",7,8 June 2008,"Walking into the midnight screening of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull gave me such a feeling of exhilaration. A film that was nineteen years in the making, that seemed to be in development hell, I would finally get to see with my eyes. When the film ended, I felt I had seen a great film. It wasn't perfect, but I had been entertained. Then, after a few days of thinking about it, I felt that the movie was not as good as I may have thought it was. Yet despite these flaws, the positives outweigh the negatives.Dr. Henry Jones (Harrison Ford) is back and with World War II over, Russian communists become the bad guys for Indy to defeat. A badly accented Cate Blanchett plays Col. Dr. Irina Spalko, who is on a quest to find the Crystal Skulls, which is said to have the power of mind control. Indy meets up with a young rebel (Shia LaBeouf), who comes complete with a switchblade, leather jacket, and motorcycle. He wants to find his father and his mother who went missing looking for the skulls. Eventually, Indy finds himself once again facing off against the forces of evil and along the way, learns a secret he may not be prepared to handle.A lot of personal hype was riding on this movie. I don't sugarcoat the fact I'm an Indiana Jones fan. I have the box set and have seen all three films numerous times. My personal favorite is the first one. Keeping with the tradition of the Indy films, the film has great action. There is a great motorcycle chase, a chase through a mysterious jungle, and a fight scene involving killer ants. The scenes are wonderful and just fun to watch. They don't have the Michael Bay style of editing so we get to focus on the action instead of being distracted by the technical aspects of the film.One addition that turns my heart to gold is seeing Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood. She is an unrecognized actress who never got her due in Hollywood. She didn't do much after the 80's, and I can't name off the top of my head anything noteworthy after Starman, but she brings back the strong will and fierceness that she gave to her character. Despite her age, she is not a helpless woman. She can hold her own against the main cast in the film. Another talent is Shia LaBeouf. This kid has a great future in movies. He will be going on to great things. He's smart, funny, and tough who plays the role of a rebel just right.All praise aside, I for some reason feel more inclined to discuss the downsides of this film. First off, this movie doesn't look like an Indiana Jones film. It has a new cinematographer, which is the reason why. The first three were filmed by Douglas Slocombe, while this one was filmed by Janusz Kaminski, a favorite of Spielberg's. The first three films had this unique comic book look to them. I can't explain that well how this one looks, but it doesn't look like an Indiana Jones film. The film is also too long. Some scenes go on with too much yap and not enough zap. A scene with Indy talking to the dean of the college he works at in his office really was just more of a nod to the fans of the series and it should have been handled with less time consumption.It is well noted that director Steve Spielberg has claimed this film would use little CGI. To be honest, it was producer Frank Marshall who said this: ""Steven (Spielberg) is very aware of the process and we're not cheating with CG (computer graphics) at all. It keeps the B movie feel."" It doesn't seem like they kept their word. The film seems to be heavily laden with computer effects from backgrounds, animals, sets, and other entities that probably could've been used with traditional effects. It's disappointing to see these effects. I am sure that some scenes had to be done with CGI, but that doesn't give the filmmakers the excuse to use it ad nauseum.Perhaps my biggest problem is the ending. This a minor spoiler for those reading. I think Spielberg has an affinity with aliens. Aliens are his deus ex machina. It was great in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T., but it gets very tiresome. Aliens did not have to be answer to this film's conclusion. It doesn't fit into the Indiana Jones arc. There have been elements of fantasy in these films, but they fit well into the films. The aliens don't. It feels very forced, as if the director said ""I have to make a reference to aliens and UFOs somehow."" It should be in a scifi film. Not an action-adventure-comedy.Was the fourth installment of Indiana Jones worth it? I say yes. It's got flaws. It's a much different movie than the other three. It could've been a lot better. Maybe I'll even say the movie was not necessary to make. Indeed, Spielberg could have just re-released all three films ala Star Wars, without the updated effects of course. But I can't hide that I did enjoy the film. It's got great action and the nostalgia is just too much to turn it down.Verdict: 7/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
308,kevin_crighton,"Doesn't live up to the huge expectations on it, but it's not bad",7,24 May 2008,"When it was announced that Spielberg, Lucas & Ford were going to make Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skulls, it was a movie that like another Lucas film The Phantom Menace, could never live up to the expectations heaped on it. Coming 19 years after The Last Crusade with a much older Ford, and after movies such as The Mummy series, The Tomb Raider movies and games, the National Treasure movies, and countless others had borrowed the idea and format in one form or another, it was clear it was going to take a huge effort from Spielberg/Lucas to give us something to come close to what the audience and fans would want. And on the whole, I think they've done the best they could have.Harrison Ford may be getting to old for this, but wisely the movie acknowledges this both in the setting (1957) and the story. No more Nazi's to fight, this time it's the Russians in the Cold War he's up against. Like the previous Indy movies, Ford does as much of the stunt work he can, and can also convince in scenes were he has to have fist-fights. I remember years ago seeing an old Charles Bronson movie where the fights were obviously staged to make him win. But here, there is none of that. Like before he brings charm and humour to the part.The rest of the cast on paper are impressive. Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko, the leader of the chasing Russians. Ray Winstone as a friend of Indy's from the war, Jim Broadbent as the Dean of the college where Indy teaches. But in the movie none are really that well developed. Broadbent doesn't appear much, Winstone's character is a bit badly written, especially towards the end, and Blanchett, while giving a good performance and handling the action well, is under written. We needed another Belloq from Raiders, or someone like that who was a well written character. Spalko sadly isn't.The other main parts of the cast are Karen Allen and Shia LaBeouf. Allen as Marion Ravenwood is a welcome return. Her scenes with Ford show some of the chemistry they had in Raiders is still there. I did wish there was more scenes between them. LaBeouf as a character called Mutt Williams (there has been a lot of speculation as to who he is. See the movie to find out). As an actor he does well, and again handles the action quite well. But like others in the cast, the part feels under-written.And this brings me to the weakest part of the whole movie, the script. Lucas came up with the basic story, along with Jeff Nathanson, so any criticism of the plot may be his, but not the finished script. There have been stories written in various movie magazines and web-sites about all the writers who have had a go at writing this movie. In the end it fell to David Koepp. I don't know what the other scripts were about, or how good they were, but have read that Koepp kept some of the elements from those efforts in his final script. What's left is a mix of story elements that feel like they are in the right place, but yet feel a bit forced in places. As to what the Crystal Skulls are about, I won't say but this brings up another point. The CGI.There has been some criticism of the use of CGI at the movie's climax. It should be noted that every Indy movie has had some visual effects to a degree, but here they just about get away with it. Spielberg was quoted as saying there would be little CGI in the movie. There is more here than in the previous 3 combined, but the story does require it, and to be fair, it doesn't unbalance the movie totally.Spielberg as director isn't, I don't think, quite firing at his best here. I think after movies such as Munich, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, War Of The Worlds, and other more serious work, it's been a bit hard for him to get back into the mindset needed to make this movie the thrilling ride the first three were. Having said that however, he's still one of the best directors of action sequences on this scale and he does these very impressively. There is more imagination and humour here than in a lot of big-budget movie action scenes, including some of the movies mentioned at the start. It clearly shows that even a mis-firing Spielberg is a better director than some others!So is the movie a bad one then? In short, no. It is still entertaining, funny in places, and shows that age clearly won't stop Indy from getting into the thick of the action! As I said, it may not live up to the hype and expectations on it's shoulders, but then no movie could.Indiana Jones may be getting on in years, but it's good to see he's still up to the challenge!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
309,howboutthisone_huh,improved the picture quality?,8,10 January 2019,"In the era of hidef and ultra hidef and 4K it's difficult to appreciate the cinematography of ""the last crusade"" when it came out. It was so beautifully shot, the action and story was secondary to the experience in the theater so when I saw this sequel in the theaters, it was very disappointing. The picture definition was off and every scene seemed to have a dark yellow tint to it. The cinematography was so distracting it threw all the other elements of the movie off and I hated it and found fault with just about everything. Later when I rented the DVD, same thing. I never bothered with the bluray because as far as I could tell the formatting was intentional. But, I just watched this again on netflix and I swear they have changed the print because it appears to be a lot better than I remember and IMHO the movie is now a classic indy picture, no better or worse than the prequels. I guess I'll have to rent the dvd, if I can find it, and compare again. If you watch the ""filmworker"" which is a documentary about one of stanley kubrick's assistants, you'll hear a lot about how kubrick obsessed over the prints and formatting of his movies. They don't go into it in much technical detail but quite a lot of effort went into each print to make sure visually it was the same movie that kubrick intended. Something tells me that neither lucas or spielberg put as much effort into the visual preservation of their movies but this movie looks to me like it was remastered. BTW, for the record, there are no gophers anywhere in area 51 or any other area of the test site.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
310,BrickNash,Fun adventure but nowhere near the quality of the first 3 films.,7,2 June 2013,"The man with the hat is back, but is it a welcome return?I along with everyone else in the world was brimming with excitement at the prospect of seeing one of my favourite and possibly the greatest adventure hero grace the screen for another outing but on viewing the film I think it left everyone more than a little confused.To start with the good it's an Indiana Jones film, there's no getting away from it. The cast and crew have all returned to work on the movie and with a pedigree that strong you were never in a million years going to get a bad film. Ford slides back into the Jones role effortlessly (although portraying a slightly more calm and settled version of the hero) and all the usual action, whipping, chases and fights are included and the supporting cast boasts some real top notch acting names.So why wasn't the film a smash hit and loved by all the loyal fans? Well it's hard to put a finger on any one thing. The biggest flaw really is that in a nutshell the concept and story just wasn't that great or interesting. I personally loved that the film was set in the 50's and had a cold war theme running through it but this was only barely grazed on and not explored anywhere near enough. Apart from a few forced stereotypes you'd be hard pressed to tell what era it was.The other big flaw is that the film has become a cliché of a genre it pretty much created. Nearly 20 years had passed since 'The Last Crusade' and in that time other action adventure films were released and gained much praise and Crystal Skull feels like it's cashing in on those films rather than continuing it's own legacy. I can name more than a few scenes in the film which are pretty blatant rip off's of The Mummy, MacGyver and there's even a few bits which bear more than a passing resemblance to the first Uncharted game. This brings me to the next point, Spielberg and co were pretty brave in declaring that the film would remain true to it's legacy and utilise old fashioned movie techniques but this is a promise that is blatantly not kept. The film is rife with CGI and I even clocked a computer generated whip at one point. This completely de-values any sort of daring stunt or action scene because it's just not real and you don't really have the sense of wonder thinking ""how did they do that?"" Shia LeBeouf straddling two cars with a ton of CGI to back him up is no match for Vic Armstrong physically climbing under a real moving truck.And now we come to the glaring bad taste. Why the producers chose to include LeBeouf in the film is beyond me other than him being Spielberg and Michale Bay's golden Boy at the moment. There is absolutely no need for a son sub-story in the film and it probably could have done just as well if not better without it. I'm not knocking LeBouf, I do think he's a fine actor but his part in this is something I don't like and that is a forced character in place of missing ones. I would have been overjoyed to see Indy re-united with a grown up Short Round instead of the Mutt character and where is the tremendous character of Sallah? Karen Allen makes a welcome return and it's great seeing her and Ford Together again but it's a wet fuse in that the dialogue is rather dull and the gross under use of a talent like John Hurt is paramount (forgive the pun) to criminal. Even John Williams score seems lazy and uninspired and besides the famous fanfare the new pieces are extremely forgettable. The film is really nothing more than rehashing old lines and gags. So much more could have been made of the adventure side of things as demonstrated by the excellent 'National Treasure' films. There's no real puzzles to work out or clues to follow, it all sort of just ends up with everyone in the same place at the same time.Still through all this moaning it is still an Indiana Jones film. The image of Indy standing in the foreground of an atomic mushroom cloud is striking imagery and like it or not the action is good and done well.So much more could have been made of this film by exploring the ideas it presents then seems to ignore but as it stands it's a fun and entertaining couple of hours but nowhere near the quality of the first 3 films.In my opinion, the true sequel to the trilogy was done years before, not in a film but in a game. Indiana Jones and The Fate Of Atlantis was a magnificent interactive Indy adventure and if they had went for a film adaptation of this or similar and canned the CGI I think it would have been a winner.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
311,arthera09,such a sad movie to watch,5,23 June 2009,"I cannot think of a sadder movie in terms of what this means for the careers of all of those involved. I do not think any one other than Spielberg got out of this movie without embarrassment. I will say that this is the best I have seen Shai, but he still was not good. I just did not want to punch in the face for the entire movie. I still wanted to punch him in the face for most of the movie, but not all of it. I am not sure why there is so much hype around him. There are so many better actors his age. He just does bigger budget movies than the rest of them. I watched some of the making of special and that really illuminated how far gone Lucas has gone. He needs to quite film making or at least stop ruining beloved characters. I was never a huge fan of the movies, but I enjoyed them all and I certainly agree Indiana Jones is one of the most iconic figures in film history. But this movie was just terrible. The acting was over the top and by the end I just wanted the movie to end. I looked for things that I liked, but could not find any. I think the only reason I give this movie a 5 is because we all love the character and their were moments when we could see what we loved about the series and then it was gone. I think the thing that ruined it was the script. It was the worst thing I have ever seen and not even Spielberg could save that and he is one of the best in the business in getting his audience invested in the story. Some of it was so bad I had to cringe. There were a lot of fun moments in the film, but connecting those moments were just filled with campy silly scenes. The scenes with the poison darts and the one liner at the end seemed more like the entire scene was thrown together just so Jones could deliver the one line. Terrible. Just Terrible. There are only two more things to say that is ""nuke the frig"" and ""interdimensional beings"". If he had just called them aliens I would not have been so mad. I would have been mad no matter what he called them, but when the aliens are first introduced I just gave up on he hope that this movie would be alright. This is one of my longest reviews and none of it is good. I am sad.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
312,Ozzy2000,the 1957 Indy Movie with flashing digital red numbers,10,22 May 2008,"I am a great fan of the Indy Jones series especially the first ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". This film follows the same pattern as Raiders in that the Communist Soviet regime of the 50's seeks world domination by harnessing the power of a lost Alien relic that found its way to earth 5,000 years ago in the Ancient Mayan culture in South America. In raiders the villains are the Nazi's who epitomized evil and they seek an Ancient Jewish relic for its power and the resolution twist is original. In this one the negativity of the Soviet regime would be sublime to today's audience and the fifties America relies on classic icons of the era. Had the usual jungle, the skeletons, creepy crawlies , the spider webs and moving stone slab tombs.Harrison Ford looks really aged and burnt out and the use of stunt doubles takes up most of his appearances. Indy's side kick comes across as a smarty Ponce and Cate Blanchett's character is woeful with her horrid Russian accent and is that her real nose? The car chase scenes contain the usual acrobatics and the audience seemed unaffected through it and so I was because we have seen it before. The red digital countdown clock at the start in the military secret warehouse was very strange for 1957.The image of Aliens at the end was also cliché but I guess a younger audience unfamiliar with Indy Movies would have enjoyed it much more.I personally loved it because of adventure action pace and great CGI and the iconic nature of the series. I think Spielberg had run out of myths and conspiracies to rely on and shades of ""National Treasure"" , ""Close encounters"" and ""Independence day"" were all evident. Even the Crystal skull looked a bit like Ridley's ""ALIEN"". The film tries too hard to be everything to everyone.Even though Spielberg and his production army failed to provide a plausible villain this time the film is a must on the big screen. Considering there isn't much else on so I think its worth the entertainment and fun.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

314,Ibuk,Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal Skull-A disappointing entry,4,13 June 2008,"I went against my judgement and saw the 4th Indy movie last week and it would be suffice to say I was very disappointed. The movie just lacked the key elements that made the original trilogy so great. First of all the script was pretty weak, secondly it lacked excitement for me. Then we have the unnecessary casting of Shia Leboeuf, the only reason I can think of for casting him is that he will appeal to the youngsters. There are many implausible scenes, for instance why the hell did John Hurt turn up at Indy and Karen Allen's wedding after she had lied to him all these years of her son's paternity. Just when I thought it could not get any worse lo and behold aliens appear(yes aliens!!). Mr Spielberg was once my favourite director but after enduring Transformers and Indy 4 he has gone down several notches.

315,joestank15,Fun but unnecessary,5,24 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystallized Skull - In his *groan* fourth outing, it's now 1957, and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is racing the Commies to get his hands on....an alien skull. I'm not kidding.Gosh, you know, it seems like everybody was eagerly anticipating this movie except me. I love Indiana Jones, don't get me wrong. But if the Star Wars prequels have taught us anything, it's that you can't go home again, not if George Lucas has anything to do with the production. There is a reason that in the original films Indiana Jones was fighting the Nazis, for the same reason that we don't see Spiderman fighting the genocide of Darfur (now *that* would be an interesting Spiderman 4). There was a proper decade setting and situation that Indy had to deal with, and now things just don't feel quite right. Imagine Zorro swashbuckling in Canada and you get what I'm talking about.For one thing, the Indiana Jones of yesteryear got out of situations through actually shooting people and bleeding and quick thinking. This Indy, with a four movie franchise under his belt, 20 extra years of age and Shia Labeouf, just comfortably stews in his invulnerability and does whatever until the bad guy is killed at the end by magic. He's still the best card in the movie's deck though, and his charismatic presence makes it all the clearer what the new Star Wars movies lacked. He tries to lend credibility even as his crew goes over not one, but three waterfalls. With the Pirates films on his heels, Spielberg somehow felt the need to push things a little too far. Sometimes it works, sometimes not.The earlier mention of Shia Labeouf is actually not meant as a detriment. I disliked his performances in Transformers and Disturbia, but he's not bad in this. Cate Blanchett makes a good villainess as the militant Russian Irina Spalko. John Hurt is thoroughly wasted as he is forced to play mad for most of the film. Ray Winstone is just annoying as ""Mac"".There are three awesome chase scenes and a terrifying sequence involving Army ants, one of my new phobias. Unfortunately the gunfire seems to not even matter now, as no one is even winged or seems to react as the enemies shoot load after load at them. Maybe Irina gave them all blanks by mistake. The final act is disappointing and takes the Indy franchise completely out of it's element, a fatal mistake. What a shame. Watch it, then watch Raiders of the Lost Ark and compare. Better yet, just watch Raiders of the Lost Ark.Fun but very unnecessary. I won't be looking forward to anymore part fours. C",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
316,Idiot-Deluxe,The Most Disappointing Movie of All Time.,2,30 September 2016,"Coming from a huge, long-time, Indy fan this is BAR NONE the most disappointing movie ever, my hatred and contempt for this Cinematic Crime of the Century is mercurial.I saw this POS once eight years ago (I'd like my ticket money refunded Mr. Lucas) and absolutely loathed it. Everyone involved in this train-wreck of a movie completely let down Harrison Ford, who despite being much older, still had the spark.I don't know what's worse the ridiculous plot or the excessive (often goofy looking) use of CGI, not to forget the questionable casting of Shia Laboufe, or a wrinkled and aging Karen Allen, then there's the ""vaguely Russian"" villains, that just seemed so contrived and out-of-place - not good villains (see the first two films for that). If the plot wasn't already incongruous and haphazard enough for you, don't worry they'll squeeze in some alien rubbish towards the end. Anyone who's familiar with the series will readily see that the BS-factor is at it's highest in the fourth film, with instances such as: surviving a NUCLEAR EXPLOSION simply by climbing into a refrigerator, riding a jet-sled at several hundred MPH without any disorientation, people miraculously surviving high-speed head-on auto-collisions, jumping amphibious vehicles off cliffs only to be snared by trees (in comical cartoon-fashion), swingin' with the monkeys (if that wasn't a Disney Moment I don't know what is), non-existent machines cutting through extremely dense rain forests at breakneck speed while falling immense trees one after another as if they where toothpicks and ..........well I know there are many more examples but it's been eight years.Maestro Williams' score (usually a very important factor in this series) is all but nonexistent, constantly over-powered by inane crap dialog and a loud sound design, a victim of an unflattering mix to say the very least. It's hard to reach a conclusion on just what aspect of this tragically terrible movie is the worst offender, the script, the casting, the grotesque over-use of CGI, the sound mix.... or maybe it's just Shia Laboufe's fault (use him as a scapegoat), no, probably not. Whatever the case this was exquisitely painful and difficult to sit through and at the same time crushingly disappointing - 19 years between this and The Last Crusade and they could not/did not put together anything better than THIS! And people thought the Phantom Menace was terrible (which it is) but this is even worse, obviously, like we've seen in the past, when the big summer blockbusters from Lucas Films run off the tracks in a smoldering fiery wreck, they do so in spectacularly terrible fashion. Just watch the other films of this series and you'll know JUST HOW BAD Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is, it's utterly mind-bending in comparison. How did this happen????? There should have been a warning sign at the theater, warning people of this movie, ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"" in red neon would have fit the bill sufficiently. It's a movie I wish I could erase from existence.The only positive about this disaster is how up-to-the-task Harrison Ford still was (at 64 or 65 years of age), but of course that was completely squandered. As I sit here writing about this miserable movie, I can fell my hatred swelling and my blood pressure rising - to say that this movie upsets one's mood is an understatement.And here's another. Analyse it's title just for a second ""and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" the very title of it sounds (to my ears at least) like a REJECTED title for a Pirates of the Caribbean movie (yes, one of those Johnny Depp pirate movies).I actually held back a year when upgrading these classic films to Blu-ray, due to the fact that all 4 films where bundled together, there's no way in Hell I'd ever own a copy of this loathsomely disgusting movie. Side-note: Laughing all the way to the bank I'm sure of it, Harrison Ford made over 60 million bucks off this tragically terrible tale........... that which all existing copies should be consigned to the flames of Hell..........I'll give it a 2, 1 star is reserved for ""a special kind of bad"" such as: Manos The Hands of Fate, Splatter Farm, Rollergator or (cringe) Samurai Cop 2.This movie is nothing but pure sh*t and for those of you who like this movie, you are stupid and have terrible taste in movies..... and lastly FRIDGE YOU!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

319,zacpetch,Disappointing.,1,3 January 2015,"Three movies in this series was enough and this fourth instalment proves it beyond a shadow of doubt.The plot sees Indy return but instead of fighting Nazis he's turned his attention to the Soviets. This different time period is chosen to reflect Harrison Ford's older physique which is just as well. Otherwise Dr Jones would need recasting and that would not be acceptable. Especially since his performance is the only decent thing about this movie. He manages to rise above the material; nobody else can do this.Indiana Jones is required in this movie to investigate a crystal skull that apparently has mythical power and wisdom. If that sounds daft it's because it is. It gets worse too. En route he meets up with a young man played by Shia Leboeuf who's only purpose is to be irritating. This ultimately turns out to be a son he had with Marion (from Raiders). Before that he has to escape the Russians at Area 51 and ends up in the middle of an atomic bomb test site. How does he escape from that in time? Answer: Hide inside a fridge.I would say that this series has officially jumped the shark with this outing, but that phrase is outdated. Now, thanks to this film, a series doesn't jump the shark anymore: Instead they Nuke The Fridge.Indiana somehow survives (the fridge is lead lined) which is a scientific impossibility. The movie should have been realistic and let him die there and then. It would have been disappointing but no worse than what actually happens as the movie progresses. People shouldn't have trusted George Lucas to resurrect this series - Look at what happened when he did the same to Star Wars - but they let him do it and he gave us this.The ending is the worst cop-out in history too. The skull is taken to a temple and put atop a crystal skeleton. The skeleton turns out to belong to an alien which is resurrected now its skeleton is back together (that makes sense) and it boards a spaceship and leaves to the space between spaces. Then Indy and Marion get married.What a wasted opportunity. This should have been excellent but instead it was utter garbage. And I'm calling it that to be polite.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
320,cdjh-81125,"A Different, Misunderstood and Worthy Entry To A Fantastic Series",8,14 September 2017,"In 2008 I was a kid and I hadn't really heard of Indiana Jones before but my parents insisted on taking me to this movie, I obviously didn't pay any attention to reviews at that age so all I had to go off was my own opinions and I was impressed then and I still am. I still find this movie to be a fantastic way to continue one of my favourite franchises, even if it's not without its flaws.The character of Indiana Jones is better than ever, Harrison Ford clearly cares about this character and put real effort into playing him again, he's great in the action sequences and is great at playing him as an older man. I liked that he's been through a lot since the last movie, he's seen things now and the fact that he was more on top of things in this movie makes sense and felt like the right direction for his character in this movie. Unlike most people I actually liked Shia LaBoeuf in this movie, he's clearly having a good time in this movie and the fact that he isn't the most likable guy is part of his character arc in this movie. I liked the return of Marion in this film and the implications it had for Indy. Steven Spielberg is clearly still on top of this franchise, he made this film feel like the franchise was still in the 80s and I liked that he chose not to forget the past while still making it feel like a modern movie. The action sequences are all great, really brutal and I liked that Indy was a bit more capable in them in this movie. After the last films have done God-like artefacts, blood magic and Holy Grail's, why are aliens so unbelievable? One of the goals of this movie was to make it feel like a 1950's B- movie so Aliens felt like the obvious choice. Like the last film there was still a lot of mythology around them and the mystery being built up was always intriguing. They did something different with this movie to separate it from the rest of the series which is something a sequel this long in the making should do. As much as I like this film it definitely isn't flawless, a major problem being an overuse of CGI, I don't mind it when there isn't any other option but there are plenty of instances in this film where visual effects were used where practical could have been used to better effect. It didn't help that the CGI was often underwhelming and very noticeable which did take me out of the experience at times. I really didn't care for a lot of new character in this film. I've never been a very big fan of Cate Blanchett, especially not here. He accent was really goofy and over the top, she was also a very one-note villain who wasn't given much motivation. John Hurts character didn't really add much, they built him up for so long that I couldn't help but be underwhelmed when he arrived on screen. I liked Ray Winstone in this movie for his charisma but his character wasn't the best, he did add much and they could have fleshed out his past with Indy more. I still really like this movie after all these years, Harrison Ford is still perfect as the titular character, I liked LaBoeuf and Allens additions, Spielberg directed the film very well and it took the franchise in different directions. It may suffer from an overuse if CGI and an underwhelming villain but I find this film so enjoyable that I'll continue to watch it with the rest of the series for many years too come. 8.3/10: A- (Fantastic)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

To me this indicated that the project was definitely on. Being a fan of ""Indiana Jones,"" naturally I was very keen ton know what was happening and then I was informed that it was going ahead but without Sean Connery. It was a bit disappointing to know that but I was still keen to know how Indiana Jones would be revived. Now! It has been worth it. It has been brought up to date and Indy is now in the 1950'sThe KGB are in the USA secretly and they find out the secret of artifacts which is known as the Crystal Skull.They try and get Indy involved but he manages to escape. After he is interrogated by the FBI, he is informed that he may no longer have a job at the college where he is teaching. But then a teenager comes up to him and asks him for his help. Unaware that the Soviets have an ""eye"" on him, he agrees to help.This movie, which stars Harrison Ford, John Hurt, Jim Broadbent, Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen and Shia LaBeouf and is produced by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, has definitely been worth while waiting. Though it is not like the others such as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"" or ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade,"" this is still worth while to watch and more so if, like me you are a fan of Indiana Jones."" As always from George Lucas and his company, one can expect some breath taking affects and not to mention scenery as well as special effects. But be warned that if you are scared creepy crawlies, then just don't watch those certain scenes. However, something tells me that we may have another dose of ""Indiana Jones"" at some stage in the future."" Conclusion: Worth watching and a good entertainer.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
324,dcobbimdb,"Decent movie, but taken too far and just too unbelievable",1,23 May 2008,"Sadly I understand that with movies these days, especially with sequels, there's always that need or push to outdo what's been done before. And while I understand it's needed to some degree to keep the audience entertained, this movie just took it too far and lost me in terms of its semi-realism Now Indy films IMO have always been entertaining, comical, action packed and yet still somehow kept enough realism to be somewhat believable and let you forget you're watching a movie but rather get absorbed into it. However with this movie, it just went too far off the deep end and half way through I was like, ""Okay that's stupid,"" or ""Okay that's just way too unbelievable."" As entertaining and action driven as it still may have been and who knows, maybe this spoon feed computerized world we live in today simply means push the limits as far as you can, simply because we can. Well for old school guys like me (and granted I'm not that old), something is lost in doing that. Too me it doesn't matter how much effects, action and general entertainment there is. Once it's way past that believable point as it was with this movie, then I just loose all interest. Now certain exceptions can apply of course, in make believe lands, such as Lord of the Rings, Matrix, and the like, then there is no boundaries far as I'm concerned, but the Indy movies don't fall under that category and are supposed to be in the real world.The other somewhat downer for me was the whole plot. This Crystal skull quest, which I'm not going to spoil anything but again this was just a little too far fetched and out there and seemed like it was more fitting for a Sci-fi movie rather than an Indy movie. Plus I thought the end was a bit of a let down and somewhat incomplete.Overall the movie did have its funny moments, and that's one of the things I always loved about the Indy movies, and it was very entertaining and pretty much nonstop action. Unfortunately for me though just too unrealistic overall and the plot itself left little to be desired.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
325,thepriceofpayne,Huh?,6,27 May 2018,"Many view the film in a negative light, but I don't think it's as bad as they've said. The acting is top notch with Ford, Blanchett, and surprisingly LaBeouf giving there best. This is a Spielberg film so you know the direction is great. The visual effects are dated (even for 2008) and it feels a little off seeing a franchise that was built around practical effects go full CG in some scenes, that said when scenes are done practically they look very nice. You can feel the Later Lucas try and nudge its way in like he did with the prequels, but you can also feel the Classic Spielberg try and protect the beloved franchise. The writing is pretty bad, the addition of inter dimensional beings and some cheesy dialogue don't help. However I've realized this film is a great way to introduce little kids to the Indiana Jones franchise. It doesn't have many dark scenes in the classic trilogy, but that's also where some of the charm is lost. The good thing about Indiana Jones is that it was fun adventure for the family that could be dark at times, not a straight cartoon. In the end the film definitely has its moments, but it's not a classic Indy story.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
326,Thorsten-Krings,Very well made roller coaster ride,9,29 May 2008,"Indiana Jones is back! It's not easy reviving a franchise after 19 years particularly if the earlier films also had a nostalgic ring to them in trms of being a homage to 30s and 40s serials, films and comic strips. And there is one other problem: back in the 80s Spielberg and Lukas always managed to present the audience with scenes or special effects never seen before. To achieve this is impossible these days. However, Indiana Jones IV does not disappoint. It's a fast paced action film set in the 50s with an aging Harrison Ford playing the role effectively but also very tongue in cheek. The story is about as entertainingly implausible as all Indiana Jones films and that's the way it's meant to be. The action sequences are faster paced than they used to. There is humour, good dialogue and great chemistry with old love interest Karen Allen. Cate Blanchet gives a great performance as Russian KGB dominatrix. All in all a very well made roller coaster ride. There are two things I didn't like about the film: although Shia LaBoeuf gives a good performance I think someone more rough and ready would have been better for the role. Secondly, the chrystal skulls are absolutely unconvincing as props. By the way Ford handles them you can tell that they are plastic.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
327,pepekwa,disappointing,5,30 May 2008,"It was always going to be a stretch doing a fourth film almost twenty years after the 3rd one. But this was always going to be made by the studio as the genre is a license to print money for them. Like everyone else,I immensely enjoyed the original three films, they were action-packed rollicking flicks with inventive ideas, a great supporting cast and some of the best sequences seen in movies, Indy running from the cannonball, opening the Ark, freeing the slave children etc. This movie had none of that ""magic"", there was little in the way of the memorable sequences mentioned that its predecessors had and it had a very complicated plot which to be fair, you don't go to an Indiana Jones to find about, you're there be on the edge of your seat as he fights the Nazis and snakes etc. Talking of that, the Russians here are the bad guys as the producers presumably decided that Indy had to age at some point but you were never squirming in your seat compared to Indy's previous run-ins with the 3rd Reich. While the make-up department should get an Oscar for not making Harrison Ford look a day older than 45, the action scenes were definitely compromised as there's only so much work you can do with stunt doubles. To make up for this,as mentioned there was some high convoluted plot involving skulls and aliens which I still do not understand and the ending sadly ended up in schmaltz which is a shame. The Last Crusade should have been exactly that, it tied things up nicely, but again Hollywood got greedy and made a very unsatisfactory sequel.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The fact that the film plot makes assumptions that there are no one out there intelligent enough to read through the lines presenting the doctrines of persons like Erich von Däniken and L. Ron Hubbards weird fantasies about aliens from other planets being ""gods"" from ancient times, makes me annoyed.At least the three original films had a major part of realistic historical information - about as well the Ark of the Covenant as the Holy Grail (though it is in conflict with most theories) and the hindu religion, it at least has some reasonability within.This plot doesn't.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Tonight I watched it in its entirety for the first time in 12 years, and it was better than I remembered. The humorous bits were, as usual, a highlight for me. The only area which did not fit for me was the final sequence, which was much too reminiscent of a video game, with falling blocks and retracting stairs.

331,adrongardner,Indiana George and the Kingdom of the Crystal Caca,1,23 May 2008,"George Lucas and Steven Spielberg hate you. They hate the audience enough to throw caca at you for more than two hours and call it Indiana Jones. They are greedy and any talent they may have had, is long since past. The latest Indiana Jones is the prime testament for this. What could possibly be the excuse? They had it all. They had 20 years. They had unlimited money. They had a crack team of Hollywood screenwriters. They even had Harrison Ford in a fedora. Yes they had it all, and all they could come up with was a plastic glitter skull and a bunch of CGI gophers. Oh, and by the way, the whip actually makes a cameo appearance.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a bad movie. Not a passable movie. Not a popcorn movie. Not a ""B"" movie. Indy IV was an outright bad movie. I fault three main things for this outcome. 1. David Koepp's writing has always been procedural. Sometimes that works for a movie that is procedural. LIke a Spiderman origin story for example or the ride-like Jurassic Park. But here, Koepp works to the point of agony to constantly remind us we are watching an Indiana Jones movie. Why? This is the third sequel? Did he think we would forget? Why so many characters. Why the father/son story again? Why waste Karen Allen? 2. George Lucas and his fascination with endless computer effects. Raiders of the Lost Ark, the one true Indy movie, was so solid because it actually felt, even with all the Ark nonsense, it may take place in a real world. But in Indy IV, we get CGI ants, monkeys, car chases and those damned CGI gophers. Didn't we already see cheesy stuff like this in The Mummy? Itself a bad rip off off Indiana Jones. 3. Too much money. True creativity comes from working around limitations. With all the money and computers they used for this movie, and most other ones these days, the limits of film-making are all but gone. This has shown not to be a good thing. Michaelangelo made David from a solid block of marble. That is hard work. Would it be the same if today Michaelangelo simply made David in Photoshop?All the other Indiana Jones movies had it right. You forget the MacGuffin artifact for the most part until the end. Sure they chase the Ark some fire rocks or a holy grail for two hours, but you don't bother the audience with it because the artifact is essentially pointless. Its always the adventure, the journey and the characters that matter. Well not here. The over crowded cast lugs around this giant plastic skull that looks like it was bought from BIG LOTS for an hour and a half. By the time we reach the end, there is no surprise, excitement, or even energy. The movie is all monkey swung out.With an unlimited cash supply, you wonder these old timers could just say, ""SCREW IT! Lets spend our fortune and make a great movie before we ride our Oscars into the sunset!""For all I know, that is exactly what happened. They did spend their money and ride off into the sunset. But i can hear George Lucas laughing all the way to the bank slinging crystal caca at the audience.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
332,RCWjr,Good stuff though age is showing,8,26 May 2008,"I have rated all the other Indy movies a 9 as they each take a turn, at times, being my favorite given which day you ask me. The latest film is not quite a 9, but it is a strong 8.Harrison Ford is back and he is in fine form. At times he looks all the 60+ years that he is, but there is still the fun of the hunt and the wonder of discovery evident in his portrayed of Indy.This one does feel different than the others and I think that is done on purpose. It is set almost 20yrs from the last film and we are now seeing Indy in the late 50's rather than the late 30's of the previous films. I enjoyed the nods to the elements of the day, to include nuclear testing and the ""Red Scare"".I enjoyed the other worldly aspect. Given that these films have always aspired to represent their times, it was a perfect subject to tackle since UFO's really gained a lot of notice in the 50's. It only makes sense that Indy's next great adventure would lead him to an ""alien"" path. I mean really, he has found the lost Ark and the Holy Grail. There is nothing worldly or Godly that is higher than that, so the storyline this time makes all the sense to explore.If the film suffers from anything it is too many new characters joining the party. Indy, Mutt and Marion would have been just fine. The others just seem to be there for exposition purposes.I thought Shia was really good. He comes off older in this film compared to his recent roles. Also his famous ad-libbing is kept to a very minimal and his performance is the better for it.There are over the top action sequences and what else would we expect? This is the series of films that gave us a man sliding under a truck, three people falling from the sky in an inflatable raft (safely landing on the ground). So anyone that wants to throw rocks at the film for being over the top needs to put the previous films in the DVD player and reacquaint themselves.Pure fun is what the film is. Though Indy is showing age, the film is a worthy addition to the franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

334,jaredpahl,"Spielberg, Lucas and Ford Reunite for an Underrated Adventure Worthy of the Indiana Jones Name",8,2 September 2015,"The belated fourth movie in the Indiana Jones franchise, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull sure gets a lot of hate on the Internet. It's hard to place why exactly. In general, the scorn seems to come from a few infamous moments of cheese (nuking the fridge, swinging with monkeys, aliens). Admittedly, there are moments in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' return to the Indy franchise where things can get pretty goofy, but what some people choose to disregard is that overall, the fourth Indiana Jones film retains the spirit of fun and excitement that permeated the first three adventures in the series. 19 years after The Last Crusade, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Harrison Ford slip right back into rhythm in an adventure that feels at home alongside the iconic 80s trilogy.Taking place around twenty years after the events of The Last Crusade, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull sees an older Indiana Jones continuing his life of adventure. The first we see of him, he is being led to the warehouse which housed the Ark of the Covenant in the first film. That warehouse is, of course, Area 51. What follows is a plot that sticks to the basic globe-trotting formula that Indy fans are used to, albeit with a welcome twist. Where the first three films payed homage to the Saturday Matinée Serials of the 1930s, Crystal Skull does the same for the sci-fi B-Movies of the 1950s. The new villains, Soviet Communists and a colorfully caricatured Irina Spalko, played with gusto by Cate Blanchett, want to get their hands on this film's MacGuffin, An alien Crystal Skull, for their own nefarious plans.Helping Indy prevent the skull from falling into the wrong hands are Mutt Williams, a rebellious greaser played surprisingly well by Shia Labeouf, his mother, Indy's old flame, Marion Ravenwood, once again played by Karen Allen, and Mutt's Uncle Oxley (John Hurt), whose mind was warped by the power of the skull. The plot is all very familiar if you've seen any of the original movies. An unrelated action scene kicks things off, followed by a scene explaining the MacGuffin. Then there is some exploration, and nonstop action until the credits roll. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull follows this same path, with many of the same beats as all the other films had. What's important is that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull feels as fresh and fun as its predecessors. Credit has to go to George Lucas for creating a story that plays as an unabashedly cheesy tribute to the classic sci-fi schlock of the 50s, while still remaining quintessentially Indiana Jones. Once again, Lucas was not content to revisit the past, instead offering something new and creative. In the end, the plot is familiar, but the story is fresh, and that makes for an engaging experience. The reason I'm baffled by the hate regarding Indy 4, is because Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ""feels"" like Indiana Jones as much as the opening scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The sense of adventure is tangible in the performances, in the exotic locations, and especially in the action scenes. There are a couple of classic Spielberg showstoppers in Crystal Skull. The opening warehouse scene is a refreshing showcase for traditional stunt work. The big jungle chase/ant fight bolstering the film's midsection is a visual buffet of jungle scenery, swordfights, and rock-em-sock-em tomfoolery. Even the controversial nuked fridge scene is a gleefully inspired 50s take on the classic ""Hero escapes the needlessly complicated trap"" scene. The action and adventure of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is familiar, but never boring. There is just something to seeing Indiana Jones exploring a ruined temple or fighting atop Jeeps while they rumble through the jungle, that will always make me smile. It helps that Harrison Ford slips into the iconic hat and whip like no time had passed at all. He's as charismatic as ever, and while it wouldn't have been surprising to see him sleepwalk through his return to the character, Ford turns in a committed and lively performance. This is the real Indiana Jones alright.I don't think Crystal Skull showcases The Big Three (Spielberg, Lucas, Ford) at their absolute best, but all three contribute great stuff to what is ultimately an exceedingly entertaining adventure. The complaints from the internet haters are honestly all superficial. A moment or two that makes your eyes roll, or some excessive CGI. Honestly, I have my own tiny hangups with the film, but you see, none of the Indiana Jones movies are without their quirks. And that's what makes them Indiana Jones! The series has always been formulaic and silly, and thankfully Crystal Skull doesn't feel the need to change. Some fans may have been thrown off by Indy 4's shift from 30s serial homage to 50s B-Movie homage, but at its heart, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is made up of the same ingredients as Raiders, Temple, and Crusade.The problem with Indy 4 haters is that a good portion went into the movie looking for something to complain about. George Lucas had already disaffected himself to a particularly vitriolic segment of Star Wars fans, and any silly CGI shot was destined to be ripped apart. The rest of the haters are either forgetting or willfully ignoring why the Indiana Jones movies are so much fun in the first place. You do yourself no favors if you go into an Indiana Jones movie expecting subtly, realism, or complex characters. You have to be ready to give into the craziness of the whole thing. I was, and I absolutely love the movie. I love the 50s spirit, the sets, the music, and the humor of Lucas and Spielberg's last Indiana Jones collaboration. Go in with an open mind and its impossible to leave without a smile on your face. Normally, I don't go in for the ""true fan"" argument, but in this case, if you love the Indiana Jones Trilogy, there is no tangible reason to hate Indy 4. Because if adventure has a name, it still must be Indiana Jones.85/100",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I didn't like ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" but I think the first and third movies were among some of the best ever made. Having said that, I was really looking forward to seeing ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Now I'm not going to drag this review on forever because I hate when people do that, unless they've really got something to say. I'm just going to cut to the chase: This movie is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen. Everything about it is inferior to its predecessors.Casting Shia LaBeouf as Indy's son was an absolute disgrace. One of the stupidest things I've ever seen on the silver screen happened with his character. At one point, he ends up swinging on vines through the jungle with a bunch of monkeys. How stupid is that? If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, and if you haven't, consider yourself lucky.Another scene in the movie that was particularly cringe worthy was the scene in which Indiana Jones hides inside a lead-lined refrigerator to keep from being harmed by the fallout from an atomic bomb. How stupid is that? Like that would really workcome on! The refrigerator gets blown hundred of yards and lands hard on the ground but Indy is perfectly A-OK, give me a break! Now I know there's been some impossible stuff that's happened in previous Indiana Jones movies, but this movie was just over-the-top, in my opinion! I didn't like the storyline at all. I think the choice of making Indy discover aliens blended genres incorrectly. I liked how both ""Raiders"" and ""Last Crusade"" had Indy searching for religious artifacts, and I think they should've done something similar or do what I heard the movie was rumored to have been about in the first place: Either having Indy search for King Arthur's sword, Excalibur or have him look for the lost city of Atlantis. Either option sounds better to me than what we ended up with.I hope to God they don't hand the franchise off to Shia LaBeouf. If they end up making him the new Indiana Jones, I'm going to throw up.I've heard rumors they're working on an ""Indy 5"" and maybe they are, but I hope they go back to the drawing board and come up with something a whole hell of a lot better than what they gave us with this installment. This is just a disgrace and an insult to any self-respecting fan of Indiana Jones. If they do, in fact, make a sequelit better have Harrison Ford as Indy, and it needs to be more rooted in reality than space aliens.

I sat down to watch the film with mediocre expectations, and it took me but ten minutes for my worst suspicions to be confirmed -from the first scene introducing our hero, this film is a cringe-fest, a tongue in cheek (not intentionally) and tepid recreation of what was SUPPOSED to be one of the most exciting sequels of my life time. Eventually my mind stopped paying attention altogether and instead began manufacturing various ways to improve it. Then I walked out of the theater. There's really nothing that I can write here, but I saw this at Cannes, and many people walked out of the theater - not to be rude, but to prevent the perversion of a great childhood memory (like Star Wars, thank you George).

337,frankenbenz,"Surprisingly, Indy 4 Doesn't (Completely) Suck!",7,29 May 2008,"I was wrong. Despite all my advance ranting, I ended up enjoying Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I thought I'd made a convincing argument why it would suck and despite 2/3rds of my argument being founded, the movie managed to successfully buoy the dead weight. I was right about Cate Blanchett who was a laughable archetype with a pitiful Russian accent (think Madame Yes from the Flintstones ""I'm too important to be captured!""). I was also right about the CG...waaaaaay too much CG, especially for a movie Spielberg swore would employ practical effects and avoid CG. But I concede, I was very wrong about Shia LeBouf who, despite a somewhat corny entrance and getup, was a solid companion for Indy. LeBouf won me over showing strength as both a naturalistic and charismatic actor. Keep in mind, we're not talking about a masterpiece here and while it doesn't come close to Raiders it is comparable to The Last Crusade and is, in my mind, better than Temple of Doom. With a personal fascination of archaeological paradoxes and anomalies, Lucas' concept proved to be intriguing, despite being over-the-top, even by Indy standards. Aliens and spaceships? Isn't this X-Files infringment? But despite the escalating flights of fancy, the quest is grounded in real-world mythology and where Indy distances itself from imitators like National Treasure, is its ability to render its artifacts and elaborate sets as...real. I guess when you've got 150 million to Greek walls, sets and props, there's no excuse for not making it look 5000 years old.There's some incredibly silly sequences in the film, like the spaceship climax, the car top jungle swashbuckling and Shia doing a Tarzan, but we're in mindless popcorn movie territory so a little camp has to be expected. One has to keep in mind the entire Indy franchise is an homage to Hollywood serials and if you let go of lofty expectations, this film will take you on a fun, escapist ride with a number of intriguing plot points and history specific scenarios. Lucaspiel really tried to push the envelope in terms of 'grandness,' but despite my hunch this type of roller-coaster-like excess would kill the film, it didn't. As for Harrison Ford, he's still the highlight of this franchise and despite being an old man, he owns every second of every scene.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

In fact, I've only ever seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and this new installment. However, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull shows from the very first moments that it's going to be somewhat of a disappointment.We can immediately tell how much time has passed. Gone are the day of amazing live-action special effects; just about every scene featured some very significant and kinda fake-looking CGI work. Apparently relishing the 'freedom' these new computer capabilities give, Spielberg has delivered an Indiana full of huge and ridiculous action sequences that very quickly make the movie lose any credibility. Of course, credibility was never a strong point anyway because of the weak story that reveals itself from the very start. Even for an action-driven movie like this one, the plot we are given feels like way too much over-the-top.Yet in spite of it all, it's still easy to find enjoyment here. The performances are all full of energy, and the cast is clearly having a great time. Ford, LaBeouf, Blanchett, and Allen all somehow manage to keep us along for this silly ride and even manage to keep us amused. And while some scenes will no doubt have you groaning and rolling your eyes (a particular vine-swinging scene comes to mind), if you'll let yourself get washed over in the campy, hokey fun of it all, you can find yourself an enjoyable romp. 6/10 stars!

339,piratecannon,Henry Jones... Junior,8,29 December 2012,"19 years. That's how long it was between Last Crusade and the 2008 release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.The question, of course, is this: was it worth the wait?It depends on your point of view. For me, the answer is—unequivocally —""yes.""While there are oodles of fanboys who would have you believe that Crystal Skull is nothing short of an atrocity against mankind, it's actually a pretty good movie. As stated in my previous Indiana Jones commentary, this is actually my third favorite of the series (again, I think Temple of Doom is slightly more well made, but I enjoy this entry more). Let me explain why.It seems that Spielberg and Lucas were aware of the need for the franchise to return to its roots. I'm not trying to suggest that Last Crusade was, in any way, shape, or form, a departure from what Jones is all about. No, what I'm pointing to here is that Crystal Skull nicely reinserts the ""homage"" factor to the series. That is, it feels like this entry was designed to pay tribute to a very specific genre: 50′s era B-movies that were fueled by Cold War paranoia and apprehension about saucer men from Mars. Sure, this is a blatant departure from the 30′s/40′s serials that made Raiders such an appealing feature, but, given its roots, it makes sense for Crystal Skull (and the characters contained therein) to have evolved in such a historically accurate (and entertaining way).Let me be clear, though: this doesn't mean that Dr. Jones' latest adventure approaches the heights of Raiders or Last Crusade. Not by a long shot. But, like Temple of Doom, it's immensely entertaining. Sure, the plot feels more episodic than it should, and the inclusion of action sequences that feature berserk monkeys and nuclear detonations is a bit over-the-top. Given the aforementioned historical context, though, would you have expected anything less?What's that? You don't like seeing aliens in an Indy movie? Please allow me to point out they aren't aliens—they're inter-dimensional beings. And they're the perfect compliment to the obsession with pseudo-science (like telepathy) that were the trademarks of this particular time period.So where does that leave us? I like to look at the Indiana Jones series as an EKG—it's had its fair share of ups and downs, but nothing has come close to approaching ""rock bottom."" Besides, if the pattern continues it means there's the possibility for one more epic entry.If so, I'll be standing in line at the midnight release with a bag of popcorn in one hand and my fedora in another.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
340,DeuceWild_77,"Karen Allen as Cheech, John Hurt as Chong in ""Up the Smoke in the Kingdom of Crystal Meth""",4,17 June 2008,"I'm shocked that they waited almost 20 years to come up with this total mess of a movie with a terrible McGuffin (even Spielberg disliked it) and a screenplay that must have been written by a 15 years old fanboy. I've watched the original trilogy back in the 80's and Indiana Jones (like The Man with no Name, Han Solo, Mad Max, Snake Plissken and a few others) is an icon of my generation and everyone around my age knows what i'm talking about. Now, Lucas after messed up with his own ""Star Wars"" franchise, can't waited to do the same with our daring archaeologist, introduced to the world in 1981 penned by two brilliant screenwriters, Philip Kaufman & Lawrence Kasdan and directed by a craftsman then on the top of his game, and the end result is this soulless, lacklustre, poorly executed lame excuse for a movie called ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull"" (even the name sucks !!). Apart from the terrible McGuffin idea, the movie itself looks like it was majority directed by the 2nd Unit with intermittent parts of awfully written dialogue delivered by actors which looked like they didn't believed in the material and just doing it in auto-pilot, almost making fun of themselves like if the movie was some kind of a spoof (for that matter we already have the lighthearted & largely superior in the entertaining department, ""King Solomon's Mines"" starring Richard Chamberlain & Sharon Stone, which at least assumes itself as a ""not so serious"" jungle adventure flick and even if it lacked in the production values due to the extremely low budget, it had more dignity in it than this turd).The Characters:Ford as Indy looks like he's trying to bring the magic back, but the horrendous plot and unimaginative direction make him looks dull for most of the time. Some sparks of the early Indiana Jones that we all know, here and there can't make it work as a whole, however kudos for Ford's excellent shape at 65 years old in the action scenes.Ray Winstone as Mac, this character is even worse in importance to the plot than John Rhys-Davies in ""The Last Crusade"". Let's not blame the actor, Winstone is a very good thespian and he did his best with the given material, but the ""double spy"" gimmick is awfully laughable. Even Alfred Molina's cameo as Satipo in ""Raiders"" had more to do with the plot than Mac.It was a pleasure to watch Karen Allen back to the big screens, she's a very underrated actress and deserved a better career, but her turn reprising the great female character of Marion Ravenwood from ""Raiders"" was a major disappointment, much because the terrible writing and direction that Spielberg gave to her character. Karen looked like she was on marijuana or some kind of addictive drug for the entire movie, making dumb faces and cringeworthy smiles towards Indy. She is his long lost love or just a female stalker ? Their chemistry from ""Raiders"" was gone and their scenes together were, embarrassingly, weird !!John Hurt as Ox... what a waste of such a brilliant actor, is he playing John Lennon had he lived to the 60's years of age ? He and Karen Allen together looked like they were playing Cheech and Chong from the ""Up the Smoke"" movies. Karen on marijuana, John on LSD.Jim Broadbent is okay as a fill-in for the late great, Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody, Indy's best friend that died a year or so before the events of ""Skull"" took place. It's just a brief cameo in ""Raiders"" tradition.Cate Blanchett, deliciously, hams up as the Russian Evil Lady, Irina Spalko, sporting a Kim Cattrall's haircut style in ""Star Trek"" and paying homage in her acting and dialogue delivery to one of the best henchwomen in the James Bond franchise, Rosa Klebb, played by Lotte Lenya in ""From Russia With Love"", one of the best Bonds of the Connery Era, directed by the flamboyant Terence Young in 1963.Last, but not the least, Shia as Mutt Williams, even if i absolute hate the actor, i must admit he did an okay job playing a 50's Greaser / Juvenile Delinquent in the vein of Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"", which Spielberg, obviously, copied the looks, the cap, the leather jacket and the motorcycle for the character. In the ""special features"" of the DVD, Shia tells that Spielberg urged him to watch 3 cult- classics from the 50's for a better understood of the character: ""The Wild One""; ""Rebel Without a Cause"" starring James Dean and ""The Blackboard Jungle"" starring Glenn Ford and a young Sidney Poitier. Well, Shia did his homework.In short, this was a movie made for the Millennials (or Generation Y), not for the long time Indiana Jones' fans that watched the original three on the theaters, that rented them countless times in the late 80's and bought / played the LucasArts games based on the character. And talking about those precious / 'long gone' computer games, ""Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis"" was one of the best Graphic Adventure / point 'n' click games ever released and the McGuffin / plot was so much better and epic than the ""Crystal Skulls"" forgettable crap, it could have been the perfect Indiana Jones IV, but Lucas just adores to come in and destroy every spark of creative craftsmanship...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
341,liberalgems,Memo To Hollywood: Stop Treating Tribal People Like Inept Morons!,1,27 May 2008,"We are now in the 21st Century! Isn't it about time Hollywood puts racist, 19th Century ""savage"" stereotypes into the dustbin of history? Why are we still exposed to this kind of crap? It's sickening to pick on the most vulnerable peoples in the world! From the Amazon tribes deep inside the rain forest, to the Mbuti (formerly called ""Pygmies"") who reside in the vast Ituri located in the Congo, to the aboriginal inhabitants of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands - tribal people are quite real - and they have rich cultures with incredible wisdom & survival skills. They also own, collectively, very valuable land and other natural resources! Something huge transnational corporations and the various occupying governments covet to this very day! In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the tribal people are obviously guarding their own territory (nation). And it's obvious to all concerned, a sacred location! - It's so ironic! I can only imagine how the Civilized American Man would be portrayed if he was attempting to protect New York's Saint Patrick's Cathedral, or the Lincoln Memorial from the intrusion of grave robbers (thieves), like Indiana Jones, or a heavily armed foreign mercenary force out to do no good. He would be portrayed as heroic! But when a tribal person (Red, Yellow, or Black) tries to do the same exact thing, he's an inept, scary buffoon! Unfortunately, these perverted Hollywood stereotypes are the only contact many people have with tribal people. To help change that perception, I highly recommend two international, non-profit organizations: Cultural Survival in the United States & Survival International in the United Kingdom (England). It's about time the American public no longer tolerates this disgusting form of racism!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
342,jburtroald95,The best of the series since 'Raiders'!,7,1 March 2009,"This long-awaited riveting roller-coaster ride is really something to be celebrated. A film like this one hasn't premiered since the astonishing 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1982.) For an Indy fan to see the old cast and crew reunite after nineteen long years seems truly a miracle. And even those too young to have heard of the ingenious blockbuster franchise can join the massive crowd of devoted admirers as the series has sequels, prequels and originals everywhere so its viewing order is flexible.Although it does stall for quite a while until revealing the latest supernatural archaeological treasure that our invincible hero (an older but still just as captivating Harrison Ford) is after. The first few scenes were a monotonous detour and perhaps would have spoiled the whole thing if it wasn't for the wonderfully satisfying performances of dedicated Ford and the stunning Cate Blanchett as the sinister and disturbingly greedy Russian Agent Irina Spalko, Dr. Jones' newest rival. But the old spirit of the original starts showing when Indiana is approached by young Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) a distressed teenage boy who pleads Indiana to help him rescue his kidnapped stepfather whose captors are coincidentally being led by Spalko. After just being sacked from the university after the suspicious FBI ransacked their premises he agrees to aid the boy in his quest hoping to redeem himself. So soon he finds himself once again battling foreign military forces to get to the mystic Crystal Skull.Naturally the expectations of this film were unbelievably high and failing to meet them would have resulted in huge disappointment. But the legendary film-making team haven't collapsed under the pressure; they've stayed calm, trusted their instincts and delivered another marvel incredibly close to the excellence of the first one. The rather enormous time gap between the less successful 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' (1989) is almost invisible, state of the art special effects and picture quality are used but otherwise it seems to have been made in 1992. The dazzling array of contrasting characters interact with each other in scenes using containing things from breathtaking action sequences to gripping dialogue. Although this film is entirely devoid of insight, morals, deep emotion, educational aspects or anything that will win it an award it is an incredibly entertaining two hours and that is really all a successful movie needs to be. I strongly encourage all those over the age of eight to ignore the classification and the silly little complaints of other critics and go see it. Directed by Steven Spielberg and co-starring Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent and Karen Allen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
343,BigWhiskers,Why 19 yrs in between movies?,6,18 January 2012,"I mean I know how Spielberg works in turtle terms. The Star Wars movies with their 4 yrs in between movies. If Peter Jackson can crank out the LOTR movies back to back what is the problem here? They deliberate too much over a script and then of course b/s about funding and producing and then when the years roll by nobody wants to take up the reins. Finally 19 yrs later we have the 4th Indiana Jones movie and while it's great to see Harrison Ford back in his trademark hat and whip , it's quite evident just how long it's been since we've seen Mr Jones .Ford is older and while he is amazingly fit and does do some of his own stunts at 60 plus years old , he just doesn't seem to have that same oomph he had in previous Indy films. And by that I mean charisma , he's just an older more cynical version of himself. This time around he is being chased by Russians led by Irina Spalko played by Cate Blanchett who is so laughably bad in her acting and fake Russian accent - She looks and acts like Natasha of Bullwinkle fame. They are all after a crystal skull that leads to an ultimate treasure . Along the way Indy also meets up unknowingly with his young son played by Shia Labeouf who is actually not that bad considering who he has to play up too and we also have Karen Allen returning as Marion Ravenwood , Indys gal-pal whom we hadn't seen since Raiders - she is one of the few bright spots in the movie. The rest of the film tries to play out like previous incarnations but it gets much too busy and the explanation behind the whole crystal skull mystery gets much more convoluted and of course ridiculous. The ending is somewhat of a disappointment and the very last scene as Indy and Marion get married is so contrived with the hat blowing in the wind as if it's time to pass the torch to Indys son for a whole new set of adventures. I just hope they do not do any sequels with Shia Labeouf as Indy Jr. I think maybe this is it though as who really wants to see anyone other than Ford as the star of an Indy movie. 6/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
344,tubby1,How the mighty fall,2,4 January 2009,"If you are looking for Indiana Jones in this fourth outing... you won't find him! The previous three films had tension, thrills and laughs, however they appeared to have been made obsolete in Indiana Jones and the Awful Crystal Skulls.The script is so dull, uninteresting and rather unfunny it really is hard to fathom why this was given the green light. I was at a loss as to the purpose of Indiana's adventure. The moments that were meant to be funny were not, the action scenes too long and unengaging and the story altogether bland. This is made even more excruciating by the fact that Spielberg directed, and yet could not see the inadequacies of a script missing all Indiana's heart and soul. Ray Winstone plays an annoying British aid, who does not need to be in this film, and John Hurt a comatose professor who does not even have to test his thespian talent. The most glaring mistake is the way Shia LeBeouf is asked to portray the up and coming Indiana. I don't think you can find anyone you can detest more than LeBeouf's character, overtly arrogant and dis-likable.The ending is the strangest I could have imagined, and concludes with a too heavy does of saccharine for my liking. This is honestly one of the biggest flops I have ever watch, expectations so high and yet miles away from any form of acceptability - time to hang up the hat for good.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
345,fallyhag,I no longer link Spielberg and Lucas with brilliant films. This was BAD :(,2,14 November 2008,"I am an original Indie and Star Wars fan. Great films that have lasted the test of time. I love a lot of Speilbergs work and know he has that music magic...or so I thought. I talked the wife into getting the DVD and have just watched it. The DVD is now on sale on eBay, it is that bad.This film is so laughably bad you would be justified in thinking that he took the time off and just let some passer-by have a go. Where do I start in trying to translate how poor this film is?The cliché are painful. Cockney villain, Russian evil person, nasty Russian brute who never bruises....cringe worthy stuff. But must would agree that you could over look that for a good film...not here. Not at all. The story really is thin. It starts with non-sense action then goes to Indie getting off a train coz some lad on a bike asks him to. Then we have a shot of him at the table in the cafe where when minute his hand is on the cup and then, change camera, hand is off it. It is a sad day when Spielberg cant even be bothered with set continuity. But it tells you all you need to know. The quality of this film is rubbish. Next minute he is up to his neck in laughable action. The story also tries to get you to think you have a brain tumour and forget what actually makes sense. There are two key scenes that involve a fridge and then a sword dual in the jungle that really just confirmed all my suspicions. Ridiculous.You can sense Lucas has been in this film coz it has been overdosed by unwanted CGI. The film stinks of it. It never worked for his Star Wars disasters (not the originals) and it certainly never worked here. All the scenes are focused on getting a pretty but artificial picture to look at. It may just as well been a cartoon at some points. I wont harp on coz I hate to read the really long reviews in here but I am 100% sure that the current rating for this film is VERY exaggerated and probably a result of some paid film flunkies trying to boost its profile. But no matter what your film taste you will struggle to like this one. The story is awful, the action makes no sense, the characters are unimportant, the villains are cliché and the ending is dire.When you leave this site just remember one thing and that is that this film has now reached number one of the worst films I have watched this year (Nov 2008) and as an Indie fan I am not chuffed in saying that. My wife told me not to bother, and damn, she was right.100% NOT recommended. PS: Spielberg & Lucas....retire now!!! Your film creations are lazy CGI efforts that deserve no attention at all.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
346,scarletminded,Indy may be older...but the film was as good as the others...,10,14 July 2008,"I don't really understand why people don't like this film. It is basically like all the other Indiana Jones films, except maybe the special effects are more sophisticated. It is just as cheesy and family fun oriented as the first three, same silly double take moments, same impossible situations...do people dare to say that scenes in this film couldn't happen in real life but all those crazy scenes in the other three films were realistic? Come on! They were just as over the top. I bought the set of films before my boyfriend and I watched the last one, and other than getting used to an older and slower moving Indy, we loved it. I liked the fact that Karen Allen was included in this one, as a love interest, in a more sentimental and not as red hot love affair as in Raiders of the Lost Ark. I also liked that Indy had a son that was as rebellious as he had been with his dad, who I wish would have appeared, but I respect Sir Sean's decision to stay retired. With Henry the 3rd, it opens a whole new range of possibilities for this series. In true form, it is a series.I liked the fact the movie was in the 50's since a lot of the 30's Nazi-themes seemed played out. The contrast between Indy's old world adventurer and the somewhat safe haven of 50's suburbia and college life, was excellent. The alien theme tied well into the 50's motif too. And who doesn't like Cate Blanchett as a super hot Russian bad girl complete with sword and page boy? There was very little I didn't like about this movie. I would have liked a cameo from Short Round, I guess...it would have been cool for him to be an adult somewhere in the films, I assume the last Indy film will be made now?If you liked the old Indy films, there isn't a reason you shouldn't like this one, unless you grew up and now, can't enjoy your imagination because everything has to be ""real"". If you want to nitpick why monkeys wouldn't attack someone or people can't go over waterfalls and live, may I suggest you re-watch the other three and take notes of all the impossibilities, impossibilities that serials that inspired these films did every week, with the hero always getting out of them. To the rest of you, sit back and enjoy the show!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
347,blackburnj-1,Disappointing but entertaining nevertheless,6,25 May 2008,"In 1999, George Lucas re-launched his first great franchise by making the Star Wars prequels. Expectations were huge but they were, by and large, disappointments. So it is not surprising that fans have approached the idea of a fourth film in Lucas' other franchise, the Indiana Jones films, with a mixture of trepidation, delight and high expectations. So, after eighteen years, how is Indy holding up?Steven Spielberg has said that he would only produce another Indiana Jones film if he could promise the fans something new and a double serving of butter popcorn with frosting on top. Well, good popcorn entertainment this is. It is ""crash, bang, wallop"" fun all the way and, whilst it may not have the all encompassing wit of the originals, it still has a number of amusing moments. The film has problems (more of that later), but boring it ain't.However, it is perhaps a little too entertaining for its own good. There is never any let up in the pace and, therefore, the plot and the characters take second place to the action. There are old characters making there return, chief among them Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood and Ford's Indiana Jones. Indy is still a hit after all these years and Ford does a fair enough job. Karen Allen is also quite good fun but the return of Marion is a bit of a dud. Their rekindled relationship doesn't really work, partly because it isn't really given any time on screen.The new characters are a mixed bag. Shia LaBoeuf is the best thing in the film and his Mutt Williams is a real stroke of brilliance. His Brandoesque entrance and fifties style is magnificently well done by often bringing the film's best moments, mostly between Mutt and Indy. However, other characters don't work. John Hurt is given a rough deal in an attempt to replace Denholm Elliot, whilst Cate Blanchett chews the scenery in an attempt to distract everyone from the fact that her character is a one dimensional pantomime villain and quite what Ray Winstone's even doing in this film is anyone's guess. Once again, the script plugs for mega-action rather than character moments, which were some of the best parts in the originals.In fact, the script is a real problem. Despite some amusing and entertaining pieces, on the whole the dialogue is wooden and forced whilst the plot simply descends into utter, over-blown nuttiness. For a long time the benefit of the doubt was given but the finale was simply too much. The beginning is badly paced, so the film never feels like it has truly got going and then it ends rather abruptly. On the whole, David Koepp's script is a pretty unremarkable piece of work.This is Spielberg's first film as a director since he took a break a few years ago (his last one being ""Munich"") and he does quite a good job. It's not exceptional but it's workman like. He combines superb design with competent action direction. He thrills and entertains and his enjoyment of the fifties motif is obvious from the start. There is no sign that his career is winding down.So, how is Indy shaping up? Well, this isn't a terrible film. It has a lot wrong with it and with a plot as convoluted and crazy as this it should be a lot worse. But, it's Indiana Jones and, as such, it is a lot better than most action films that are so flawed. This isn't something new, but it is pretty entertaining. It's a disappointment but it's not a disaster. It's not terrible but it's not that good. In fact, one of the most telling facts is that the kids behind me loved it, cheering and laughing all the way through. Is it worth another crack of the whip? Possibly. As for this film, if you have nothing better to do go and see it. It couldn't hurt.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
348,moviemattb,The Adventure Still Lives,8,11 December 2016,"After Indiana Jones disappear on the big screen, since his last adventure for searching the Holy Grail and his father; many people have wondered if there will be another one, so Steven Spielberg reunites with George Lucas and Harrison Ford as they decided to make another ""Indiana Jones"" movie. The trailer hit the news, and everyone got so hyped up and were just completely let down after seeing it. I've been hearing too much hatred of this movie, and I believe that this movie needs to be rediscovered from what has been overlooked by everyone that have been picking on the movie. Maybe not everyone, but still picking on it. The movie now takes place in the 50s era, where you have all the sci-fi B movies that came out and instead of Nazis you have the Russians. Indiana Jones returns as he is now an old man, but still is a man that can fight. He comes across with Mutt Williams as they embark on an adventure to look for the crystal skull, while we have the return of Marion Ravenwood, and the Russians going after it as our heroes need to return the crystal skull to where it belongs before it is too late. I may be the only one that really likes this movie, so just hear me out before trying to attack me. When I saw the trailer, I was hyped, and thought that this was going to be the best one since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Sadly, it wasn't as I hoped for. However, when it was over, I really did had fun watching it. So why do I like this movie? First off, Harrison Ford is still Indiana Jones, and I love the way how the movie builds up as we don't see Indy yet, while we see him trying to pick up his hat and as the camera turns, he turns to the camera. Welcome back, my man! Also, he still looks great in his iconic outfit and really impressed that he was able to do his own stunts for the most part. I never had a problem of him being an old man, so it really doesn't matter. Shia Labeouf for playing Indy's son, I thought he was good too. The relationship between them isn't on par as the relationship between Indy and his father, but it works well on its own as it is not a carbon copy. Cate Blanchett for playing the main villain isn't up there with Belloq or Mola Rom, but she is better than Donovan from the third movie. I thought her performance was really good, and really do like the way she looks and the eyes she gave on Indy. Ray Winstone does a fine job, but nothing to run home about. John Hurt, at first, I thought he was useless, but as time went by he isn't what I thought he was. His character does serve for the movie's plot as he does know about the crystal skull, and really wants to return it so he can be his normal self again. Karen Allen returning as Marion was a real treat, and I couldn't be more than happy to see her again. She still is spunky as she was from the first movie, and really love seeing her smile again. Steven Spielberg's direction is absolutely fantastic, and still knows how to setup the camera, and making the action so exciting. The story may not be the greatest, but I think it is fine for what it is. The cinematography is really good, as it is bright and colorful looking. The action in this movie is just as good as the first three movie. The special effects by ILM are good, but not really their best work; it may have CGI in it, but it is not one hundred percent complete CGI. The movie does feature practical stunt work as well as practical effects. Some of the CG is good, while there others are not. John Williams' music isn't up there with the music he created for the first three movies, but it is pretty darn good. The humor is still there, and I thought they were funny for my taste. I was smiling at the end of the movie, where Indy and Marion got married, and I believe these two should stay together. I know it may turned people off, but I really don't care. The series doesn't always have to be James Bond, where Indy goes from one girl to another so it really doesn't need to be a big deal. I'm happy that they are together. I really never had an issue for having aliens in an ""Indiana Jones"" movie, because let's face it, the series weren't meant to be realistic, and the filmmakers are always going to put supernatural elements for all the artifacts that Indy searches for like spirits coming out of the Ark, pulling someone's heart, and a knight waiting in a cave. I know the series have some religious aspects, but they are more than that. I do admit that I don't think we need to see Mutt swinging through the jungle with monkeys, so I think it should've been cut out and focus more on the chase scene. The infamous scene where Indy hides in a fridge at a nuclear test site, I think everyone is making this too much of a big deal and I believe it is just as ridiculous as the whole ""Han shot first"" thing. Overall, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" isn't all that bad as what many people are making it out to be. If you still don't like this movie, that is fine but I like it, and enjoy it for what it is. The adventure still lives, and I am giving it an 8 out of 10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
349,tomrito,Good Summer Entertainment,9,25 May 2008,"I thought this film was entertaining from start to finish. Even though it is over two hours long, it played well and kept a good pace going all the way through. All the major characters, Indiana, Mutt, Marion, and especially, Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko, did a great job with the material at hand. Although, that material at times could be somewhat unrealistic and not as interesting as the previous three Indiana Jones films, it still had enough archaeological specifics and comedic interaction to make this a decent installment in the Indiana saga. After watching the movie, I went back and watched Raiders of the Lost Ark to try and find why the magic of the first three films was somewhat missing from this film. What I think I found was two things; first, the writing was somewhat more believable and less contrived, and second, the young and charismatic Harrison Ford was so compelling that he carried everything along with him. Youth must be served. So although we can never again have a young Blade Runner, Han Solo, or Indiana Jones, I guess we have to take what we can get.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
350,loufalce,An Insult That Must Be Explained,1,25 May 2008,"Indys back and boredom's got him in the 4th.installation of the franchise.Over the hill Harrison Ford has lost all his persona and is only going through the motions. In what obviously was an attempt-and a pitiful one at that to milk the franchise for all its worth, this sad, sad effort falls flat on its face.Now set in the 1950s, the ridiculous premise has our hero fighting the bad Russian communists-their leader is a woman with one of those ""fashonista"" hairdos for the title article-something that links human development with an alien civilization.There are the usual and hackneyed car chases, an unbelievable trip in a lead-lined refrigerator , a mock village for A-bomb testing and the totally inconsequential ending that resembles ""ET"" meets the ""X Files"" with some ""Close Encounters"" thrown in for good measure.Add plenty of cheesy looking CGI effects, throw in no-talent Shia Le Beouf{what a macho sounding name},recycle every cliché from the last three sequels, add the names Lucas and Spielberg and there you got it. I recently heard that the Russian Communist party objected to the way the Reds are portrayed in this movie. I do not blame them, but it is the Audience who really gets the short end of the stick.A classic example of a film that was designed for only thing-to make tons of money. Naturally it will have a huge opening weekend, but once the bad word of mouth begins, it will die the death that it deserves. Films like this give sequels their bad name. This is the ""Phantom Menace"" of the franchise-it does for this franchise exactly what ""Phantom"" did for ""Star Wars"". The ultimate letdown, I'm being kind to it by giving it one star. Stay home,stay away, save your money, it WILL be available on DVD by the end of the summer. Everybody connected with this atrocity should never work again! Even the ""Temple of Doom""-a miserable film in its own right is better than this. This film is so rotten, its only good for laughs.Thank me- I just saved you 8 dollars-and a trip to the multiplex. Spielberg AND Lucas have a lot of 'splaining to do for this pathetic abortion of a film. Everyone knows it was done for money, but how far down one must crawl on his knees to the God of Greed until the outright pursuit of money overrides the entire creative process?

351,ed_two_o_nine,Back but should you have been?,6,14 June 2008,"Well finally Indy has come back to rock cinemas in a good old fashion all action block buster style. Can he and Harrison Ford still cut it in the modern digital world where cg effects have come on so much since we last witnessed Mr. Jones? Well the answer for me is probably. If you are a fan then you will probably remain so. If you are a young viewer experiencing Indy for the first time then I am not so sure. Yes Indy is older but that is dealt with quite nicely with humour by Spileberg, Yes the story is far fetched, but where they not always that way, and at the end of the day where the stories ever that important, or just an excuse for a rollicking good rides with some great characters? There are some great set pieces here with some edge of the pants stuff and yes some of it is very far fetched (to much so at times for me) but it is still gripping. Now for the negatives, well the film lacks a great villain. Cate Blanchett is good but the Russians are just not as menacing as Nazi's. John Hurt and Blanchett are not given enough screen time and Ray Winstone no matter how much I like is really for the umpteenth time playing Winstone by numbers. Kate Allen just grins to much and the romance between her and Indy does not seem to work. My main objection though must be Shia Le Bouf. Not that he is a bad actor just a bad character that is being force fed to us with cynical marketing to take on the helm of Indy at some point. So fun yes, and I would watch it again, but easily the weakest of the four.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
352,robertallenandersonjr,I think it was just a little bit to old,7,22 May 2008,Indiana Jones And The KIngdom Of The Crystal Skull was a pretty good movie for the most part. I don't think it was amazing like everyone is thinking it was going to be. There are many other good movie to see that come out this summer besides this one. I think that Harison Ford kind of showed his age in this movie. Shila Labuff didn't do an amazing job like I thought he would. I don't really think that this was his kind of movie though. I hadn't seen the first 3 when I had gone to see this at midnight last night. I thought to myself though this looked pretty good and it was. I really don't think that huge action fans will like this one though. It was mostly about trying to solve the mystery and find the crystal skull. So their wasn't a whole lot of action. Going into this movie I expected a lot of action. I was kind of falling asleep during it because it was slight bit boring. I mean I think it was kind of good. It was way to far-fetched for one. Going into this movie though you have to expect it to be very far-fetched. I think that it's cool how they filmed it. I like how it takes place in older days. The acting was only good nothing special. The visuals were very cool though. Overall this was a pretty good movie nothing special. Go check it out though. Hopefully you will enjoy it.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
353,simonparker1990,"Indy is back, it's changed a bit but its still just as brilliant....",10,22 May 2008,"Okay let me be honest, there was no way in hell I wouldn't have found Kingdom of the Crystal Skull entertaining. Worst case scenario I would have laughed, been entertained and maybe forgotten it, best case scenario I would have raved it was better than Raiders and gone mad. I have fallen closer to the latter, however it is nowhere near on the same scale as Raiders, but remains a truly brilliant, highly preposterous, highly entertaining piece of popcorn cinema that people will merely hate because ""it's not the same"" as they remember. These are the same people who claimed the Star Wars prequels ""raped their childhood"". While the prequels were flawed they were also entertaining, and this movie too will have its haters I am sure. If you look for flaws you will find them, but I always found with the Indiana Jones movie that if you look for flaws in any of them you will find them. Crystal Skull to me is the antidote to so many ridiculous, over-realistic piece of blockbuster movies trying to pass themselves off as art movies. Indy is back in this movie, and its downright brilliant. From the classic reintroduction to the thrilling truck chase to the highly different ending, the movie is just a series of non-stop thrills. Harrison Ford is once again on top form, no longer the wooden actor he has been in the past few years in movies such as Firewall. The CGI is a bit dodgy at times, but then again it was never about the looks of the movie, this was always about the entertainment factor, and on those terms the movie is a 10/10 triumph I cannot wait to see again.So let me start off with Indy himself, Harrison Ford, the legend who unfortunately seemed not to care about his acting for a few years. Thankfully this movie proves he is still more than capable. After a slightly wooden start, I did panic in one scene as I thought he might not pull the movie off, he goes onto top form. He still delivers a pun to perfection, his old age has actually made the character seem a tad more alive in some respects. Although we all know he will never be injured or lose the character himself now seems more under the philosophy of ""ain't the years, its the mileage"", which I have always found key to the entire series. Shia Laboeuf thankfully isn't over used as I feared, and he is also brilliant. I'm glad he's the sidekick rather than the replacement, as let's face it who wants to go see an Indy movie and have the sidekick as the main attraction? Cate Blanchett is superb as the main villain, she's a bit underused but her scenes are still brilliant, and more importantly she seems to be having fun. John Hurt is a bit of a waste, but equally has some decent moments. Karen Allen is superb as Marion, her verbal jousting with Ford being one of the movies many highlights. I suppose my one cast complaint is Ray Winstone, whose character just is a bit too over done, watch the films conclusion and you will see what I mean. He's fun and I don't feel anger at him being in the movie, but I felt his character went a bit too far at times.The nostalgia factor of the movie I think is one of the best features. Many people will complain that the movie was a series of references strung together by a limp plot. In my opinion the whole movie is just a bit of nostalgia with a decent plot. Watch the opening scenes, one glimpse of something all Indy fans will know will send them into an ecstatic fit, I know I did. The references are thick and fast and they're downright brilliant. The action scenes are also superb. The bike chase being one of the highlights, only to be topped by a thrilling chase through the jungle. Admittedly the ending will be seen as extremely hit and miss, and I confess I have to see the movie again before I officially make up my mind on it. But it is definitely different, and in that respect Indiana Jones 4 has to be commended for its originality. The script is pretty damned perfect, loads of puns, great dialogue for Ford and just a sense of fun. Its definitely is better written than the Star Wars prequels though.So overall Indiana Jones 4 is the triumph I was hoping for. No doubt we will get the usual nostalgia brigade come along, tear the movie to shreds and claim that the second apocalypse is upon us because Lucas and Spielberg haven't recreated Raiders scene for scene. My opinion let them whine, let them moan, for the rest of us lets just sit back, relax and watch one of the cinemas greatest characters go through another great adventure.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
354,trevorwomble,How to ruin a wonderful legacy,5,11 April 2020,"The first three Indiana Jones films are stone cold classics (especially the first and third ones) but this fourth entry in the series is an odd belated fit and sits uncomfortably in the franchise.Had this film been made in say, 1992, i'm sure it would have been more loved but there is just so much wrong with it, not least the silly story that accompanies it. By the time this film went into production, Harrison Ford was already in his mid 60s, which was already pushing the bounds of credibility. 19 years between the two entries for a film about a beloved action hero has seen him move from a mature but fit mid 40s to a man who is now of pensionable age. Yes i'm glad Harrison Ford played the part rather than recast it, but with the scriptwriters having have almost two decades to come up with a script, the final result is disappointing and almost cringeworthy.Another moot point is the awful character of Mutt, played by Shia Leboef. Not only is he utterly unlikeable but also plain annoying. And that Tarzan scene is just downright embarrassing. I think the original concept was to have Lebeoef take over the role as 'Son of Indiana Jones' and continue the franchise but it very much backfires here. He is badly and clumsily written and played without charm or wit, just annoyance.The film is not a dead loss. Karen Allen makes a welcome return, Ray Winstone is a surprisingly good fit in the film as is Cate Blanchett. There are some nice touches too and dry humour but the flimsy story, especially the final act is just too absurd at times. I know the series deals with the supernatural anyway but come on guys, talk about a 'jump the shark' moment. It is also disappointing that for a series that used practical and in camera visual affects, this film should take the lazy way out and go for the CGI approach, some of which is badly executed anyway.This is a film that was made purely to cash in on a much loved character that was very much of his time and should have been left as a he was. There was no way the magic could be recaptured after such a long period but if they did have to try, then it should have been done with a far better and more respectful script than this. I suppose even Spielberg can be excused for the occasional dud but in this case I think everyone saw this pne was coming anyway.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
355,Monotreme02,"Exciting and entertaining, but missing what made Raiders and Last Crusade so good",5,31 May 2008,"It playing such an important part in my childhood, I was as excited as anybody else with the announcement that the long-anticipated fourth Indiana Jones film was actually getting made. Casting announcements got me excited  Cate Blanchett as a Russian villain; John Hurt as an absent-minded professor; the return of Karen Allen. The knowledge that the film would take place in the 1950's with the Soviets as the villains and acknowledging the characters' increased age suited me. It seemed like Spielberg was taking this on the right track; and after 19 years of anticipation, the movie definitely had a lot to live up to. After seeing it, I can say that for the most part I wasn't disappointed, but that in some departments I didn't quite get what I was hoping for.The one much-circulated quote that finally put my worries to rest was from the film's producer, Frank Marshall, who stated that the film would be shot the same way as the previous three, using CGI only when necessary. This excited me more than anything else  the prospect that at long last we would have a return to what made the original films so good in the first place  relying on well-choreographed and amazingly executed set pieces and the wit and panache of the characters. I must admit that my biggest disappointment with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull started out from the first frame, when a painfully obviously CGI gopher burrows its way out of the ground. I was hoping for a far more practical approach, but was disappointed when much of the movie ended up relying on very obviously CGI elements. Perhaps the cheesiness of the choppy CGI was meant to continue the whole low-tech approach, giving us a B-movie for the 21st century, but I felt that for the most part it was distracting.I had absolutely no problem with the plot. If the previous trilogy took place in the 1930's and thus emulated the style and sense of the old serials from that same time period, it's only fitting that this film, set in the 1950's, would similarly follow a more 1950's post-World War II B-movie approach, both in terms of tone but also in terms of plot. Soviets, conspiracies, Area 51 I wouldn't want to give anything away, but the direction is pretty clear. That said, I felt that the film at some points pushed the boundaries of suspension of disbelief far beyond what any of the previous three movies did. Naturally the trilogy is riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies, but when you're so caught up in the swashbuckling adventure, you don't even notice. And yet, there were a few moments in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull when I just asked myself what they were thinking  be it flying refrigerators, giant man-eating ants, vine swinging or monkeys with loyalties.But for the most part, the movie was just what I was hoping and expecting it to be  a bar-none, non-stop swashbuckling action-adventure. The strong cast kept things going along well; Cate Blanchett is absolutely divine as the villain, and the older, craggier version of Harrison Ford is fitting of an older, more experienced Indiana Jones who had by now gotten though a world war and an atomic revolution. The post-World War II cynicism is clearly visible on Indiana, and Ford played it out most fittingly. Special mention also must go out to Shia LaBeouf, an actor who didn't impress me much at first but who bought me over in the Spielberg-produced Transformers. He embodied and personified his character excellently, and really did an all-around excellent job in holding out with actors such as Blanchett and Ford. The film contains, as is with all the other Indiana Jones movies, action sequences and set pieces that are just absolutely so much better than anything else we're used to these days in terms of execution, choreography and excitement. Scenes such as the motorcycle chase through the college or the dueling cars in the jungle are as high-caliber and as stylish as any of the sequences seen in the original trilogy.I haven't yet mentioned the second installment in the trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. This is because I personally feel that, although entertaining and extremely enjoyable, the second film is sub-par to the first and third installments. The bookend films each have something special, something different and new that they bring to the table; in addition, the MacGuffins  the objects Indy seeks after  in the first and third films grant them a far more epic sense of importance, be it the ark of the covenant or the holy grail. Temple of Doom seems less important, less grand and epic, as if it is just one of those numerous marginal adventures Indy had along the way. So while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull delivered on the visuals, the characterizations, and the action sequences, it disappointingly down-played the elements that made the first and third films so good, and that is Indy's romantic tendencies and the father-son relationship, and so I am unfortunately inclined to liken it more to Temple of Doom than to Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade. Still, it was exciting to return to what may be the single greatest film character of all time, and even though the film isn't quite up there with the others, it was one hell of a ride, and definitely better entertainment then what we've been accustomed to lately.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
356,Animus,What the heck was THAT?,5,22 May 2008,"OK George Lucas, you have officially lost it. I thought I was going to see an Indiana Jones flick, not an X-files movie (thats later this summer). This newest Jones film is pretty enough, lots of nice special effects, a couple of cool chase scenes, but there are way too many ""HUH?"" moments in this film. The villainess is tragically underdeveloped and is basically a walking ""Natasha"" parody with a penchant for swords. The plot is more like what I expect in an Indy/Ghosthunters crossover fanfic or something. Someone needs to take away Lucas' pen and his access to green screens, I don't mind when it's needed but when you are obviously green screening a warehouse background rather than simply stacking crates on a stage, you have crosses into addiction territory. I really wanted to like this film, but sadly, it's junk. I gave it 6 out of 10 for nice effects, some decent action sequences and reasonable acting by the whole cast, they deserved a better script though.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
357,MairegChernet,"As the years went by, so did the scent of the trilogy.",7,26 May 2008,"I just got back from seeing the fourth installment of Indiana Jones that we waited almost 20 years for. I wanted to see this film for the sake of the last three, and because of the renowned makers, I am talking about Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. This isn't the best one in the trilogy, I don't know about Raiders of The Lost Ark but both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade can run circles around The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull. Now, don't take me wrong here, I did not say I hated this movie, I am just saying it didn't meet my expectations, and it did not live up to its hype. But for an adventure movie that cost $200,000 to make, The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull is indeed a good movie. Acting wise, almost everybody in the movie is well known and experienced, Harrison Ford, John Hurt, Cate Blanchett ( although I did have a problem with Blachett's character which I will discuss later), even Shia Lebouf a rising star, who transformed from that kid in Even Stevens to this mega Hollywood star in such a short amount of time. Action wise, more satisfying and more realistic action scenes., especially it being the 21st century and the makers being able to have all this technology, the action scenes were really exhilarating. Dialogue wise, sometimes dull but for the most part fantastic dialogues. Storyline wise, Everything you look for in an adventure film, people going out in search of something and that journey being complicated, the perfect twist. Right after watching this film, I said to myself there was something wrong with it but I don't know what it is. But I do know one thing I did not like about the film, and that is that they cast the lovely Cate Blanchett as this evil and monstrous woman. I just couldn't find myself imagining that lady as evil, Nicole Kidman or Meryl Streep might have been better for the role. Overall, a nice movie, no less no more than that, Go see it, that's all I have to say, not an incredible movie but the typical Indiana Jones film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

IT IS MY LEAST FAVORITE OF THE 4 FILMS.Why? In the 1st 3 films you could follow along & understand the quests for the Ark, stones & Holy Grail. But, in this film, it was very confusing the search, what they were doing & where the we going.Script. I did NOT like the script between Harrison (Indy) & the kid Shia. TOO MUCH OF ""YOU'RE TOO OLD"" TYPE LINES.Then, when we finally get Karen (Marion) into the story, all the bits about their past relationship.The chase through the jungle. Where did the vehicle go Karen drove most of the chase? It disappeared for some time.Cate did a good job. I did NOT care for Shia. Needed to make Karen (Marion) with the edge her character had in the 1st film.Big ants, the King. Did like ""Hound Dog"" at the beginning.The film did shoot it's last couple of days in my home town at Chandler Airport, so I got to see that.So, I stand by my review.

It was great to have Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood.I liked the story of the Crystal Skull and its origin. They did a good job with the special effects just like Raiders of the Lost Ark. To me, it's fun to watch this film and enjoy it. It's the spirit of the Raiders film and the whole franchise. I still like the 4th film. I give this film 10/10 stars for my own opinion and point of view. I heard that the 5th Indy film is coming soon so I'm not sure what to expect.

362,C-Younkin,Summer's first disappointment,6,23 May 2008,"It's been a long 20 years for Indy fans but their hero has finally come back to the big screen. Whether Harrison Ford is still able-bodied enough to crack the whip again is a question on everybody's mind coming in, and this is by far Shia LeBeoufs most pressurized role so far considering George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are hoping to place him in the fedora for future installments. Does Harrison Ford still have what it takes? Does Shia impress the rabid fans of the series? ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" answers these questions and the answer to both is sadly a ""no."" The 20-year difference is evident from the first scene. The Nazis and World War 2 are gone and the Russians and the Cold War have replaced them. Political correctness also rules the land with an iron fist. As Indy (Harrison Ford) returns from another adventure, he is informed by the dean of college, Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent), that his recent activities have made him the object of government suspicion and the university is receiving heavy pressure to fire him. Deciding to lay low for a while, he meets a young man named Mutt (Shia LeBeouf) who he shares more than one common connection with. Mutt is on a mission to find one of the most spectacular archaeological finds in history, the Crystal Skull of Akator, an endeavor Indy finds fascinating. Only as the two set out to the remote corners of Peru, they realize that Soviet agents are on their trail, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). They are looking for the skull as well, which they believe will help them dominate the world.""Crystal Skull"", working from a script by David Koepp, is a hard one to review. The movie has upped the action-quotient, featuring some really over-the-top stuff like a chase involving a sword fight on two speeding jeeps, Indy and Co falling down three waterfalls and surviving (beat that Richard Kimble) and Indy climbing into an iron refrigerator and going for a ride after a nuclear blast at a testing site. Spielberg tries to turn it all into the summer blockbuster we've been waiting for but it just comes off looking desperate. The CGI effects and green-screen can easily be detected all over the movie, especially in the souped up chase sequence, and most of the action is so unbelievably ridiculous that's it's hard to take it seriously as actually having any dramatic impact at all. Once a character survives one waterfall, you're pretty sure that character is going to be indestructible for the rest of the movie.And Harrison Ford is too old for this stuff. Indy swings from chains, jumps from one moving vehicle to another, and runs from and dodges bullets, all the while looking like he could use an afternoon nap. Its obvious Ford isn't doing much of this himself, but stunt- double or not, you realize early on that Indy is not the spry adventurer he once was. Ford does bring his usual class and charm to the role and you can tell he's still having fun with the character, but it's time to retire it though.Unfortunately his possible future replacement doesn't seem ready. Shia LeBeouf plays a James Dean-like hot-headed rebel. I'm not sure how this leads to him being the next Indy Jr. and the movie doesn't really explain it or give the character much of a hook. When leaving the theater, I wondered whether or not the spin-off franchise rumor was actually true. It's not a good start that's for sure. Cate Blanchett tries to be evil but her Russian accent sounds just as phony as her Bob Dylan accent. Karen Allen comes back as Indy's love interest Marion. She honestly just looks surprised to be in a movie again. And I feel sorry for John Hurt, playing a professor, forced to mutter like a lunatic through most of the movie.I've not reviewed the plot of this movie, primarily because I was not even able to keep it straight. It has something to do with aliens, and gaining knowledge and the skull works its way into that in some capacity. There is also some familial bonding going on as Marion returns and Mutt's past is revealed. It's all pretty senseless and doesn't carry much weight.It should be known that while ""Crystal Skull"" does look like a half-assed movie, it's not exactly a boring one. That's what makes it so hard to review. Ford is very likable, I usually enjoy crazy amounts of action and I also enjoy an even crazier story about aliens. Just neither Spielberg or Lucas seem to have much interest in selling the material. Danger and suspense are absent from the action, the actors are forced to do what they can, and the story is just a complete mess, and not even an interesting mess. This is the summer's first big disappointment.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
363,commandercool88,"Old school Indy, campy and fun.",8,7 July 2008,"Nineteen years and one 'Flying Saucer Men From Mars' later, Indiana Jones has returned. And yes, he's still your father's Indy. Cooking up much of the same good old fashioned fun that made the original trilogy perennial classics, Steven Spielberg and company have delivered a worthy addition to the treasure hunting, death defying, and affectionately cheesy franchise. It's Indy with a definite extra-terrestrial and Cold War twist, from Roswell to a supernatural city of gold deep in South America. Pure entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less. Just right.Our capped and fedora cracking hero may be more gray in years, and while CGI certainly allows Spielberg to get away with more than he ever could have in the 80s, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' in a way still feels like a throwback to classic 80s action rather than a modern blockbuster heavy on special effects and light on logic. We're asked to suspend our disbelief more often than before, but with the right man behind the camera and a script more than a decade in the making that doesn't forget what Indy is all about, the roots remain intact and the ingredients are there to make for a blast of vintage fun.'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' isn't a reinvention. It doesn't pull a 'Batman Begins' or 'Casino Royale' in hopes of redefining Hollywood's favorite archaeologist for a new generation. It's the Indy we came to know and love as children, and it's the familiarity of it all that makes this new film a rush and a healthy dose of deja vu. It's appropriate to say that much of Indy's return relies on going through the motions, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's not the best outing of the series, but it does what it does very well. It's corny, predictable, and light as a feather. And I'm complimenting it for that. Early buzz touted 'Crystal Skull' as the film Indy fans have feared, but there's thankfully no need.Whether Harrison Ford's return to Indy meant a great deal of stunt doubles, I don't really know nor do I really care. Harrison looks great, and he seems to genuinely be having a good time as he dons the classic outfit and returns to daring escapes and ingenious schemes. The little quirks are still there, and little seems to have been lost in the nineteen years it took for his grand return. Shia LeBeouf's touted performance as Indy's sidekick (and something a little more devious) is light but fun, and Karen Allen's return as Indy's original love interest from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a refreshing and welcome return to form. Cate Blanchett makes the best of her role as the Russian general in charge of the mission to discover the true powers of the mysterious crystal skull, her spot-on accent and menacing appearance is quite exquisite.It's no secret that writer George Lucas wanted the fourth 'Indiana Jones' to be an all-out sci-fi adventure, and it shows. While it kept the return delayed and at bay for many years, it appears that Spielberg finally struck a compromise, and 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is the final product for us to judge. It takes on many themes Spielberg and Lucas have already explored without breaking new ground, and with a muddled moral message and bland climax pushed aside, it is a successful return for all involved. The film ranks well with alongside the other three films, and that in itself is a worthy accomplishment. It's a fun, action-packed adventure, and it doesn't disappoint.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Aliens are not a part of the Indiana Jones franchise. That's for other stuff like E.T., Alien, Independence Day and other alien films.

And while my wife and I agree that it's really difficult to tell a truly original story nowadays, that doesn't mean that you have to blatantly rip off something else to the point that the dialogue is the same thing.I say that this movie is about 15 years too late because I truly believe that had it come out not too much longer after The Last Crusade, then there would have been enough life to squeeze out of the franchise.Unfortunately Harrison Ford's just too old for this sort of thing.And while I appreciate adding to the history and legacy of Indiana Jones, making him a Colonel in the Army and what have you, at the same time i felt that it made him too ""been there done that"".In the first three movies, the films that set the standard for aggressive archeology films (aka tomb raider, stargate, national treasure) there was always a sense of adventure and newness that you could face with Indy. This time it was more on the order of business as usual, yup okay here we go... again...There wasn't anything that kept me on the edge of my seat.Sure, there were some comedic moments, and I did get a laugh here and there.And it really does make the movie more enjoyable if you know the history and mythology behind it. At least knowing who Zecharia Sitchin is and being familiar with his works will bring a modest groan.As i said above it wasn't so much the story of the movie that killed it for me as it was the styling. Instead of relying on a great serial adventure film that could stand on it's own, it became more on the order of taking all the comedic campiness that existed in the first 3 films, and basing the story on that.""okay let's run through the checklist now people: Whip? Check. Fumbling here and there? Check. Snake gag? Check. Subtle rip-off of Father and Son rivalry that existed in last movie? Check...And that's what it felt like to me.I have to say that I am sad that it ended this way, and will always have the originals. I grew up on this stuff so much in fact that at one point, like most little boys who grew up watching it with their fathers, I wanted to be an archaeologist.Lord only knows what's going on in Lucas' head right now because it seems like nowadays he's making movies just to cash in on another shiny toy.It's the difference between eating because you are hungry and because you need too satisfy an instinctive urge to survive, vs. eating simply because it's there...Lucas isn't hungry anymore...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
366,eve_dolluk,Hmmmm,7,26 May 2008,"Hmmmm is all I can start with when reviewing this latest instalment of the Indy Franchise.Now Raiders will always be the best of the bunch and probably one of the best action adventure films ever. Temple of Doom in my mind was the worst out of the 4, I really did not like that film the first time or the few times I have watched it since. The third film Last Crusade was better but was incredibly tongue in cheek and had a lot less action. which bring us on to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I would rate it the 3rd most enjoyable of the 4th. Set in the 50's Indie is older living in a very different world, after the demise of the Nazi's and the End of World War II its the Cold war and Russia for Henry to have a stab at. Its the Start of Rock and Roll and the aftermath of the Atomic Bomb. Jones is still a Teacher bit has also done a bit of work for the Government in Germany in between the period from the Last Crusade.I honestly believe that with some changes to this Film it would have been much better, not big changes but just small changes. There were many scenes that just didn't work but with a bit of tweaking could have.Firstly - remove all cgi little creatures, they look fake we know they are fake and they are POINTLESS. Sceondly - The Nuclear Blast Scene, Instead of Having the fridge flying through the air for a huge distance then landing perfectly intact and having Indie climb out unscathed. why not instead have the fridge roll along at smaller distance while getting a little battered and then have him trapped for a short period of time until he is pulled out by the military with a few cuts bruises and maybe a dislocated shoulder. It would have worked and been a little more believable.Thirdly - The guards in the graveyard where they find the Crystal skull are pointless and don't serve any purpose they should have been replaced by some kind of trap or even have lots of the Scorpians instead of the one bite.Fourthly - The Jungle Car Chase scene should have been shorter, remove the cgi monkeys and make the Vine Swinging a little more believable as it was it just didn't fit it looked ridiculous. Get rid of the Ants they should have done the scorpion thing earlier and just had a good old fashioned Fist fight. The ants thing looked too much like the Mummy and again didn't work too well.Fifth - 3 waterfalls, it just didn't work the second fall was the same as the first and it was annoying to climb back in the vehicle in exactly the same way so when the final drop came you just felt a serious case of deja-vu. Any complaints about the driving off the cliff onto the tree i find are unfounded as that is exactly the sort of crazy stunt that worked in this film, the thing that didn't work with it was the lack of tension because of Marions PermaGrin.Sixth and Final - The ending was not bad but seemed a bit rushed Blanchetts character should have had a really cool death and there should have been a bit more tension surrounding Winstones death also. A little more explanation was needed surrounding the Alien, OK so one of the skulls was missing and needed returning but why was it missing and why when it was returned did the Alien make a sharp exit. Why did it not leave b4 the skull went missing in the first place. Maybe a bit of wisdom such as ""Right well I am awake again, thanks for returning my lost skull, everything looks in order on earth and you have managed to split the Atom so well done, I'll be back in a few years time to check progress and look forward to when you humans are flying through the stars so we can all have a proper chin wag. Till then Adios Adieu Au wiedersein Goddbye.""OK so maybe not but that but something at least.This was never going to be anything more than a nostalgia trip but they could have at least got it a little bit better.All the same it was fun and entertaining a little over the top and certain things didn't work well.I would have given it a 6 but i'll give it a 7 for the Nostalgia I also think some of the reviews are a bit harsh but I can also understand the disappointment of people wanting the old Indiana Jones style. Lets be honest that was never gonna happen... Ever.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
367,mcsheehey,"""Russians""",3,10 June 2008,"As he emerges from the trunk of a car, Dr. Henry Jones places his hat upon his head before surveying the scene and groaning ""Russians-"" that's right, not ""Commys"" or ""Reds"" but rather ""Russians."" In ""Raiders,"" Indy quipped ""Nazis"" but never ""Germans."" This small moment in the film epitomizes the larger picture of why the new film does not work.Everything feels at least a bit off-kilter in terms of an Indy film. Instead of good old Indiana, Harrison Ford's performance is that of Dr. Henry Jones. He's stiff and very awkward, often even uncomfortable to watch. Ford is either intent on playing down the adventure and ambition and looseness of the old Indiana or simply out of touch with his old charm and charisma. Either way, the result is not pretty and doesn't allow the audience to have a lot of fun with Jones or Ford. Similarly, Ray Winstone steps in as Jones' old friend in a very phony manner. There's no real chemistry or sense of history between the two characters. Trusting the Winestone character is vital at times in terms of buying the plot, and I just wasn't sold. The other performances are a mixed bag. John Hurt and Jim Broadbent are wasted, but they both try to make due with what they're given. Broadbent fares better as a bumbling stand-in for Brody. Shia LeBouf has his moments, but many of his lines are either poorly conceived, poorly delivered, or both. In addition, his entrance comes off as more of a rip-off than as an homage. Karen Allen, as his mother, reprises her role well enough, though the costume department gives her frumpy clothes that fit awkwardly and throw off her character. Cate Blanchett, of course, steals the show. She is fun in a sadistic and wicked way, making her performance very reminiscent of the melting-hand Nazi from the first film.Visually, the film is stunning yet ill-fitting. Kaminski's cinematography has a richness and a glow to it that Ford the actor cannot seem to penetrate. Similarly, the sets are far too obvious, boldly proclaiming the 1950s rather than eating the decade up as the other films did with their time periods. The use of cliché-ridden 50's songs has the same effect, as do moments such as the over-the-top and ridiculous diner fight scene between the greasers and the main-streamers.Now we come to the plot of the film. I blame both Lucas and Spielberg for the sorry excuse for a conclusion to this movie, but the rest of the plot is engaging enough on paper, featuring killer ants and an exciting jungle battle/waterfall drop. These scenes are incredible and bring back the Indy spirit. still, in the end, even a cool build-up reminiscent of the ""Raiders"" opening cannot redeem the blasphemy that comes next. Even worse is the pastel scene that follows. I will not spoil either of these scenes, though the film-makers have spoiled them in nature already.All in all, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" just gets it wrong. Its opening, unlike the others, is actually part of the plot. Its throw-back messy music in the opening goes too far back, overshooting, while the cinematography, though stunning, is not at all like that of the old movies. The plot ends up convoluted, and the period is overdone. Still, there are trickles of the man and the old ones in this shaggy mess.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
368,plex,Tiny feet in large clown shoes,2,22 May 2008,"*Content includes spoilers* Yes, I know. This film has the unfortunate position of living up to very high expectations. That being said, It is difficult if not impossible to watch this latest (and perhaps last) Indy' installment without comparing it to its erstwhile releases. Even with Spielberg and Lucasfilm behind this tour-de-force, the film is flat, charmless, unfunny, and implausible. Its overall look is washed out with substandard art direction, CGI, and cinematography. The main premise of this film is that Indy must return the alien crystal skull to its original skeleton so that it can merge, to form a collective with the other aliens who have been waiting to go home. That's pretty much it. There were times when the digital matting and continuity was apparent which is inexcusable by today's standard and especially by this A-list team of technicians. While the cast is strong,there is a lack of any type of character development or cohesive story line. Very little is explained about the characters or the Crystal Skull which led me not to care what happened to anyone. This film has basically one pace- action and none of these scenes had an ounce of plausibility to them. e.g. Indy and crew are completely impervious to machine gun bullets even at close range, refrigerators are you best line of defense in a nuclear explosion, all young men (Indy Jr. played by Shia) have innate knowledge of how to swing tree-to-tree like Tarzan from vines in a forest they have never been in before as well as straddle an open jeep traveling at high speed while performing a sword fight, open-top cars can carry 5 people down huge waterfall to safety, ants envelop people and plunge them into there anthill. Silly, stupid stuff that did not entertain me.The film is self-aware and poses. Harrison still has the goods but they got wasted on this one. Wait for the DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
369,legendaryunderdog,Unnecessary attempt to bring new life to the series...,5,15 October 2008,"I'am sorry IMDb readers, but I was woefully letdown with this installment to the Indiana Jones series. Just watching this film I was amazed at how ridiculously cheap and computer enhanced the sets at different points in the movie were, I understand at the same time that we are living in a different age now with technology so advanced, but I feel along with other Indiana Jones fans that the cinematography and CGI definitely made for quite an obvious departure from Lucas/Spielberg's previous work. The dialogue was lacking a lot of substance and really didn't give me any reason to care about what was going on. Although I really tried my hardest to 'keep with the program' all throughout the film. Karen Allen's return to the series was a nice retro moment but still there is too much not going on in this film to really consider it as compelling as the previous entries. I'm sure all you guys out there were expecting just as much as I was, although it was very nice to see the great Harrison Ford reprise a role that had been nineteen years removed.

INDIANA JONES IS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER BASED ON ADVENTURES AND MYSTERIESYOU ACCEPTED temple of doom.You accepted that Indians are savages who kill people by shouting kali ma and eat raw disgusting food,but can't watch indy flying in a fridge after a nuclear explosion?
M an Indian,and no we never used to kill people as a sacrifice for kali ma(may be in 1400s but not after that)You thought covenant of Ark is real? Lol!
some german scientists got his face burned and you were like wow,its beautiful
But you can't accept aliens in broad day light?
Do you really think there are humans drones watching machu pichu or pyramids 24x7 since the day they were built?
So covenant concept is beautiful but alien concept is terrible?
Such Hypocrisy,much wow!Oh you hate humour don't you?
Then what do you call Disney star wars trilogy? They cracked poor jokes which can ruin your entire life(don't blv me? Go watch star wars episode 8 n 9,you ll be puking for an entire week)
But when a fictional character, like Indiana jones displayed small chunks of proper humour for your kids,for your family u cant take them?Well then dont.
But
DON'T RUIN OTHERS EXPERIENCE...
imagine You see a kid enjoying indy 4 the movie, you're going to ruin his experience?

If you want to then you should ve died in some pit in some densed Amazon forest cuz that what you deserve.Boomers who can't accept change in cinema style are the villains of temple of doom and y'all should be at museum,Not awesome adventurous movies like Indiana jones. George had a vision and he made his own story with some experimental ideas.I loved it,new age geeks like me will forever love it.It might seem strange to you but our world is full of unexplained mysteries,some of them are rational,some of them are dont.You cant and won't be able accept those MYSTERIES is totally fine

Took me on a trip down (bad) memory lane, and how I actually spent money to waste my time watching it in a theater. From the fake mushroom cloud to the 'grooming' of Shia Lebouf to be the next Indy, this is not a sequel at all, just a free-standing piece of crap.

372,joaosantos20,Huge disappointment,6,26 May 2008,"A huge disappointment. I've seen the trilogy many times and loved them all. Great movies with great stories and actors. But this one is nothing like the others, H.Ford is way too old for this, the remaining cast is OK but is son is played by a miserable actor. The story is a patch of several different parts that don't add up, especially the nuclear explosion (WHAT WAS THAT? got a few minutes of extra tape from other film??!!). Especially the story is rubbish...PS: I just loved when is son cried ""professor"" when chasing the train in is bike, and minutes later is surprised because he finds Indiana is a... professor.

373,matheusmarchetti,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Bore,2,27 June 2008,"I've really enjoyed the first three Indiana Jones films. They are great and the main character is truly an 80's landmark. When I heard of Indiana Jones 4 being made, well, I was quite excited! Still, after seeing the trailer I was bit disappointed, but, due to the good reviews I decided to watch it. It is a fun film, but it isn't a good film. It's filled with annoying Hollywood clichés, horrible CGI effects and it's made as a family movie. The first Indiana films were NO WAY children's films. In the first movie, there was an extremely gory sequence where a bunch of people would melt, in the second one, a guy's heart is poured out, someone gets burned alive, someone gets crushed alive, to name a few. The third movie also had a guy who started to rot alive!I was really disappointed, it seems they did it for money and not to bring back a classic franchise. Even Harrison Ford was pretty weak as an actor here. 2/10 stars on my book",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
374,Phil_H,"Just not ""it""",4,30 May 2008,"Ford, Lucas and company tried really hard to relive the past and bring us another summer like the one when I got to first see Raiders of the Lost Ark; unfortunately, you simply cannot capture lighting twice.Where Raiders was new, fun, exciting and well put together; Indy IV just seems haphazard, trite, and underwritten entirely. And that's the pity, because as a long time fan of the series, I really wanted this to do well, but I just can't get over the fact that everyone just seemed to go through the motions.Compared to Belloq and Nazis, Russians and Spalko just don't stand up as worthy adversaries of Dr. Jones. Karen Allen served no real purpose in the film; whereas in Raiders she actually did something. Shia was a lot better than I thought he'd be, but he's completely overwhelmed by Harrison Ford. Not even in the same caliber at all. ""Unworthy"" is a word that comes quickly to mind.(And no, the world isn't ever going to be ready for ""The Adventures of Mutt Williams,"" so I can only hope they don't go that direction. If they do, I won't be following.) Stick with Raiders (the only really good one of the series.) I'm sure there won't be a ""next time""; and even Sallah's children will not be able to save Indy from this unfortunate fate. What an undramatic ending for what started out with such promise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
375,GuyCC,Walks A Fine Line Between Nostalgia and Digital Nonsense.,7,25 May 2008,"I've come to realize that after two viewings, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull does not make me angry inside as the Star Wars prequels did, and is by far better than anything that was released during the dismal Summer 2007 season.That's not to say that it's a perfect film. There's still enough in the movie to retain the love for the character of Indiana Jones, and there's still a handful of classic action moments fitting for the series, but this one has a feeling of being sterile, less gritty than the other installments, and it's these brief, but all too frequent moments that keep the film from being what it could have been.The CG is the real culprit of the film, and the film could have used about 4-5 minutes of various cuts from the film. Little things, such as an unexplainable adoration of digital prairie dogs giving multiple ""reaction shots"" that did NOTHING to advance or add to the plot, delving into Lucas' realm of trademark unnecessary ""cutesy"" moments that his later films have fallen victim to. Same for his need to have a 1950's drag race at the beginning of film because he has a love affair with old cars a la ""American Graffiti"". These moments don't last long, but succeed in jarring one out of the movie to wonder why said effect or plot element was there at all.There are also some moments during stunts that push the limits of even Indiana Jones fantasy, largely attributed to the poor CG work done in the film, making some effects and backgrounds look like a Playstation game. It's frustrating to realize that Lucasfilm was the originator of the brilliant special effects movement in modern film, and now, the majority of their recent works look woefully and unmistakably outdated. As with the Star Wars prequels, the overused CG wonderment gives an ""out of place"" feeling that doesn't mesh as well with the previous installments. In contrast, the classic stunts and special effects, fit well into the Indiana Jones universe, and seemed more appropriate. This film should have stuck to classic special effects and props, and any technical flaw would have been more acceptable, being more appropriate and ""realistic"" for this type of genre ""period"" serial-style film. No matter how fantastical the plot and action of an Indiana Jones film got, there is still some grounding of reality to it. This CG doesn't feel ""real"".The hardest part of the film was Harrison Ford's intro and opening conversation as he just seemed out of character. This wasn't due to the fact that he was an older man in this installment, but he didn't seem like himself, ranging from the tone and sound of his voice, his posture, mannerisms, even facially, there was something just very ""off"". Then without warning, something in Ford's performance suddenly ""clicked"", reverting the Indiana Jones character back into his full, unmistakable persona. It's not the age or the actor that was the problem, there was just a perceived lack of uncertainty of who the character used to be, and was not a strong start to the film.There were also a handful of story elements and plot devices that were introduced and referenced, then unexplainably dropped and never mentioned again. It was like all these new and potential ideas had come to mind, and they simply remained unrealized ideas. For example, the main villain hints at having a supernatural ability at the beginning of the film that is never explored, explained, or mentioned in the film again.All this said, there were quite a handful of moments that were unmistakably Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford still has it, and while it took a few minutes to fall into place (which should have been fixed with a reshoot), the character of Indiana Jones is back like he never missed a day, which made for a lot of fun moments, though some unreturning characters were sorely missed. John Williams' music is also excellent, bringing back several classic themes from the previous films, but I honestly don't remember the new musical themes introduced into this film. There are also a few references to previous adventures which brings on a fond smile.Without divulging (incredibly obvious) spoiler elements, the film walks a fine line in maintaining its classic feel and being too modern. If they plan to do a new film, they had better start shooting RIGHT NOW. However, the idea of the franchise's suggested idea of a future protagonist delves into ""bad idea"" territory, with potential to derail the series, and minimize the central character. If so, the Indy hat needs to be hung up for the film series, and continue in video games and novels from this point. Nostalgia for Indy is what keeps the viewer, and it has a clean ending for the fabled archaeologist. If not Indy, let it be.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an alright movie that suffers from occasional uneven acting, unresolved numerous plot points, an ending that makes no attempt to surprise the viewer, and bad CG backgrounds and effects. Lucas should just stick to video games, and Spielberg should have made some edits, as the present film could have been so much better if they had just simply taken the time to just clean up a few rough or unnecessary areas. Crystal Skull is a respectable ""swan song"" for the franchise, but the potential future that the film hints it wants to take the series should be left alone. There's still enough good in the film, and seeing Indy again is like revisiting an old friend who hasn't worn out his welcome. But the series should consider stopping now while it can, because Crystal Skull managed to get away with itself without damaging the series, and that should be good enough of a note to end on.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
376,the-gossip-king,For die hard Indy fans only,7,26 June 2008,"Let me start by saying I really enjoyed this movie, it was a lot of fun and it would be an even better movie if you cut out the first two words of the title but it is another addition to the Indina Jones series and it has been a long wait for fans. I am someone I confess who had not even seen any of the Indiana Jones until maybe a few months ago. I instantly fell in love with them despite their age. I really wanted to see this movie and now I finally have I can't really complain. There were only a few things that annoyed me. 1. Visual Effects - Steven Spielberg tries to use real locations and mix them with fake ones which only works if they are on different screens but Steven for some reason has half the screen real, for example in the car crash the river and bottom of the cliff was real but the other half where the cars were driving was fake. It would have been more real if it wasn't compared to something that is actually real. Visual effects are great in this day and age but there not at the point where you can't tell the difference between what is real and what is fake. 2. Story - I know Indiana Jones is well known for being ridiculous but I think the story hear was crossing the line a little. As far fetched as the first three were this takes first prize in terms of crazy but if you can cope with that then sit back and enjoy the show. I think the main reason this movie has been receiving criticism if for the first two words. It is not as annoying as Temple of Doom but is not as good as the Last Crusade though it comes close to Raiders of the Lost Ark. I did enjoy how a lot of the things and characters that we loved in the first three were brought in subtly back to this movie and I would actually say this sums up the movie better than the third. My only advice to George Lucas or Steven Spielberg if they ever read this review is quit while your ahead. Overall, an enjoyable movie 7/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
377,TexasRedge,The New Adventures of Old Characters,4,6 July 2008,"In the last 18 months we have been exposited to Re-treads at the box office. Old actors reprising old roles in new movies. We have had Rocky 6(a.k.a. Rocky Balboa), Die Hard 4(a.k.a. Live Free or Die Hard)Rambo 4 (a.k.a. RAMBO) and now Indiana Jones 4 (a.k.a Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls).It comes without say, that Indiana Jones 4 was the one of these 4 re-tread movies I had the highest expectations for, and Rambo 4 was the one that I had the least expectations for. - And Boy did I ever get it backwards.Rambo 4 was an action packed no holds barred thrill ride, with a great story. Full of Brutal action, great plot, all too realist battles scenes, and believable realistic characters.Harrison Ford wasn't as lucky as Sylvester Stallone, despite the fact that he had Steven Spielberg and George Lucas both in his corner and pulling all of the strings. Indiana Jones 4 was awful. I loved the original 3 movies with a passion and consider them among the greatest movies of all time. How could the dream team of Speilber, Lucas and Ford make a Indiana Jones movie that was actually bad. It doesn't seem fathomable - but they did.In this re-tread. Indy has a son who is a Fonzy wanna be(from Happy Days)...I was willing to except some silliness. I was excepted the Russians breaking into Area 51, and then Indy survives a Nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge. - Okay, I am willing to except that... But then this movie went into over the top in silly. Such as Indy's son and the villain swording fighting while standing on the hoods of moving cars, unbelievable acrabatics (the kind we saw in movies like MATRIX and Blade), then he got knocked off of the car, then he swang on vines like Tarzan until he caught up to the cars, then an army of Brazilian rain Forrest monkeys magically attack the Russians.... was this really written by adults. Then the grand finale of the film was the ancient Aztech pyramid that amazingly folds up into an alien flying saucer, then a magic earthquake comes and floods out the entire area, which Indy and his cohorts survive because the magical end up on top of a mountain after leaving the pyramid. >>> this movie was all about stunts, special effects without any relevance for reality.Indina Jones 4 is not totally awful, its just silly -",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
378,TheGOLDENWALRUS,Great start but a disappointing finish,4,8 June 2008,"I didn't hate this movie. Sure it was a very long wait but I still enjoyed it for what it is which is family entertainment. It didn't have the heart that the others had (especially Last Crusade and Raiders) but whatever.The movie starts off great. Indiana Jones is in a pickle just like the other movies and he has to use his quick thinking to get out. Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) thinks she has Indy cornered but he makes his escape. During the escape you do see the ark from Raiders which was awesome. He then meets Mutt Williams had goes off to find the crystal skull. During the journey he also reacquaints with his ex girlfriend Marian. Everything was going great until the last twenty some minutes. Things started to get way out control and far fetched such as when Mutt was swinging on vines to catch up to a speeding truck or when they fall over three waterfalls in a row and not a bump on them. Sure it was meant to be funny but no one in the theater was laughing. Sure the other Indiana Jones had some far fetched moments but not nearly as ridiculous or annoying as the Crystal Skull provided. To top it all off was the ending. Of course I won't give it away but it just didn't excite me at all. I can almost say it was terrible.Some blame the mistakes on Lucas and I do agree. He doesn't write like he use to and has pretty much hurt the great stories he has done in the pass. But all in all, it wasn't a bad movie and again, it was enjoyable for what it is.My verdict: 5/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

380,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Entertaining enough,5,15 July 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has divided audiences, and to be honest, I did not know what to think of the film when I saw it. It is very entertaining, but it doesn't quite gel together. This installment in the Indiana Jones series features our hero teaming up with Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) to find the lost Crystal Skull of Akator before the evil Soviets can find it. The Skull possesses some kind of psychic power that is not fully explained.As can be expected, most of the sets are great, especially the military warehouse. The action is fun but unfortunately Indy is only at the center of it in the beginning. The car chase through campus and the warehouse opening were the most fun in my opinion. The best part is Harrison Ford's strong performance, with the exception of one or two awkwardly delivered lines. Shia LaBeouf is a funny sidekick. They were trying to go for a father/son relationship ala Last Crusade, and it would have worked were it not for the lack of any serious bonding scenes such as the scene where Connery called his son ""Indiana"" for the first time or their conversation on the Zeppelin. They make a funny duo but with little depth.A lot of the problems in this movie stem from underdeveloped plots and characters. The worst is arguably Marion Ravenwood. All of her scenes are done on the fly, during the chase. The movie needed to take a step back and breathe to allow Indy and Marion to reconcile, because the wedding scene does not feel justified. Cate Blanchette is convincing as a Soviet soldier but I wish we could have seen her psychic powers at work. It would have made her more threatening. A smaller problem is Ray Winstone as Mac. He is funny for sure, but his contribution to the movie is so minor he could have been removed without a problem. Early in the movie, Indiana Jones has difficulty coping with his old age, but that aspect of his character does not go anywhere. We are also given the impression that the FBI would give Jones some trouble later on but this does not come to fruition. These missing elements take away that extra punch that makes one feel like they have seen a really good movie.I have a few other nitpicks. Every Indy movie has had a ""creepy crawly"" scene, but this was the only one that did not use real animals. CGI ants are just not creepy. The jungle did not look realistic enough either. I do not know why they chose to insert CGI monkeys and vines into the jungle because they just make it look more artificial.The Crystal Skull is the most controversial aspect of the movie. I thought there were a few too many long segments of boring dialog about it, but it was tolerable. I actually enjoyed it for the most part, up until the end. I understand they wanted the movie to go out with a bang, but it felt so generic and fake that it just did not ""wow"" me. I think they showed us a little too much, there was no sense of mystery about the aliens. At the end of Raiders and Crusade, you were left thinking, ""I've never seen anything quite like that before,"" but we've seen Skull's ending many times. To be honest, this felt more like a good Michael Bay movie than a good Spielberg movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
381,filmtravel101,Entertaining but could have been edited/written better...,6,24 May 2008,"The film is very entertaining and as much as many dislike the CGI personally i was more interested in expecting a good story...and unfortunately just like Temple of Doom, there were too many scenes that just didn't flow.. ie, like did they really need the Fridge Nuclear blast scene.. or the silly monkeys.. or the dry sand for snake gag... but they are indeed small issues that just didn't push the storyline forward and detracted in a sense, yet i guess as many say.. lucas and spielberg will always draw on their past movies.. and it was a big surprise that the 13th Alien Skull leader didn't say ""Phone Home"". jejee but it was sure entertaining yet super cheesy - esp jumping on to a tree with the car, then 3 massive waterfalls.. more like a Universal Park ride. maybe soon to come... go figureBetter luck next time.. because surely the Young Indy, Shia, is being set up as the new Indy for numero 5.. since Harrison looks fantastic and can easily play a Last Crusade-like 5th movie as: Dad and Junior. I just hope they skip silly monkeys and the fridge nuclear blasts.. but i wouldn't put it past them in the next one to throw in a tsunami and have Junior surf it....with a monkey on his back! or Dad :)Decent film and hopefully next time they will have more skillful writing like Raiders or the great dialogue between Dad/Junior of Last Crusade. but in this movie even the Russian says 'Please Shut up'... as they continue to just show us more action and CGI instead of intriguing story/clues and great dialogue!!!I give it a 6.5",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
382,blackwidowis7cool,Undeserving of all the hate,10,24 June 2019,"Unbelievable. Implausible and impossible action. Not a true Indiana Jones adventure.
These are some of the accusations against this movie.
I am not attacking anyone, but I just want to point out that the term 'unbelievable' and 'implausible and impossible action' applies just as equally to the other Indiana Jones movies. No less, no more than the others.
And with regards to not being like the other Indiana Jones movies, why should all movies in a franchise follow the same formula, or have the same basic plot? Why shouldn't one of them be brave and do something completely different and new? That's what all franchises should do. It keeps people coming - such as in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and James Bond - and this is the main reason why I love the fourth Indiana Jones movie. It does something completely different from the previous three.
It's not a sequel.
It's an equal.
Equal and on the same level with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'The Last Crusade' (I haven't seen 'Temple of Doom').
It is difficult to talk about the plot without giving spoilers, so I will just say: Watch it! Seriously. Give it a shot. Everyone's allowed their own opinion. Whether you like it or not is up to you.
It is an amazing and extremely engaging movie with plenty of laughs. Well written, brilliantly executed, cool preposterous action scenes (which make it even cooler), and plenty of twists and turns. Interesting and enjoyable themes.
I want Shia LaBeouf to return as Mutt Williams. Mutt is not boring and is not one of those characters where we wonder 'what was even the point of having them in there?' He has a purpose. He is funny, relatable, and LaBeouf does an excellent job of playing Mutt. A really, really excellent job. Please let him return, Spielberg, for the 5th movie!
Trust me - it is utterly deserving of praise and deserves even more than the 10/10 that I gave it. An entertaining and true Indiana Jones movie.

383,matlefebvre20,"The best since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""",8,22 May 2008,"He's back... for our greatest pleasure.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has aged, but he is still the great adventurous thrill-and-treasure-seeking archaeologist we all know. And this time, he embarks himself into his most extraordinary and most sensational adventure since the first time we saw him in 1981.The movie opens in 1957. To make a quick calculation, that's nineteen years after the events of the third movie and it also corresponds exactly to the lapse of time that passed in our own time. The Nazi villains have been replaced by the no-less dangerous Soviets, and most especially the icy black-haired scientist Irina Spalko, played with mastery by a perfectly convincing and terrifying Cate Blanchett. She's probably the greatest adversary in the history of the franchise.After the Ark of the Covenant, an Hindu sacred stone and the Holy Grail, the MacGuffin of this new adventure is a mysterious crystal skull from an ancient south American civilization linked to the Maya people. This skull, we quickly discover, is actually linked to a civilization endowed with a superior intelligence. In other words, extra-terrestrials. By the way, the movie opens in the famous Area 51 and references to Roswell are made.The crystal skull seems to be some kind of key that would allow to its owner to discover the city that the Spanish Conquistadores called the Eldorado.Dr. Jones is accompanied this time by a young motorcycle-riding greaser named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). He will also meet in his trip the professor Huxley (an eccentric John Hurt) and none other than Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the female hero of the first movie, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".We can see from the beginning that Indy is getting old outside, but that he is also as fiery and fearless inside as he was nineteen years ago. And throughout his adventures, we realize that he is not the only one. Director Steven Spielberg and executive producer and screenwriter George Lucas bring some immensely contagious energy and fun to this fourth volume. It seems that they drank from the Holy Grail from ""The Last Crusade"" themselves. ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is made with a feeling of found youth and we can easily take a liking to it at each scene. The result is the best Spielberg movie since ""Saving Private Ryan"".The action scenes are as exciting to watch as they were before and the characters are puzzling and hide all kinds of surprises. However, it must be said, the surprises in this case can arouse all kinds of reactions. They can be very divergent, depending of the viewer.First, there's the Mac character, played by Ray Winstone. What he does in the movie is never really clear and his usefulness here becomes very questionable. We could have gotten rid of him and it wouldn't have changed anything to the movie, except maybe an economy of a few minutes in the playing time.Then, the link that exists between Indy, Marion and Mutt is revealed halfway into the movie and it can make many jumping. And the die-hard fans of the franchise have a great change of scratching their heads wondering if the screenwriters made a mistake or not. But I don't want to say too much neither. You have to see it by yourself and believe (or try to believe it).And even if the Indiana Jones series are based on exoticism, action and improbabilities, there are limits not to trespass. We might have been repeating this for the last twenty-seven years, but Indy is not Superman. But there are moments in the movie where the filmmakers seem to forget it. And add the fact that he's now sixty-something years old.From the beginning, we can see surrounded by above a hundred Soviet soldiers in a huge warehouse and he's able to escape miraculously unharmed. Action isn't missing, but the small amount of realism doesn't take too much time before totally fading away. And a few moments later, we can see Indy surviving even more miraculously to a nuclear explosion... I think I've said enough.However, these mistakes are quickly forgotten once the movie ends. The final events in the jungle are a moment of pure enjoyment and it's the best time to insert what are probably the only CG images of the movie. We can't believe our own eyes.And the action scenes not generated by computer aren't bad either. Especially the action scenes and the chase scenes by car and by motorcycle. And let's not forget the duel between scientist Spalko and young Mutt.I just hope that this fourth film is the final one on the list. Not because I didn't like it, far from it. But the climax makes me believe that we don't need to add more. And even when Indy comes out of the darkness after nineteen years, to add a fifth one would only be an easy marketing trick.""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" will attract as much money to the producers as the highly magnetic namesake skull, but viewers and especially the fans of the series will also get satisfied. And the latter will get sure that this fourth film is precisely not a simple easy marketing trick and that the will and joy of shooting an Indiana Jones adventure just wrapped up the creators and it can only have positive consequences.So you all Indiana Jones fans, delight yourselves! You have waited enough. Appreciate with as much joy and as much fun this gift of the gods that the greats Steven and George offer to you. And you will be grateful.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
384,Joejoesan,"No classic, but 100% Indy fun!",8,20 May 2008,"Crystal Skull is a very entertaining movie - vintage Indiana Jones. If you will or won't be disappointed by the movie depends heavily on the expectations you have. Indiana Jones 4 takes place in 1957 in the midst of the Cold War. No Nazis this time, the bad guys (or girl in this case) speak English with exaggerated Russian accents. Nice! The first part of the movie - before Indy returns to the university - set the rules actually. Indy escapes from an exploding atomic bomb by hiding in a fridge. Pure nonsense of course, but if you accept that sort of realism there's nothing in your way to enjoy his fourth and probably very last adventure.I liked the fifties setting. I liked Shia. I liked the old Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford looks great in this movie. Only his grey hair give away his real age. I liked the nod to the 'deceased' people: Marcus Brody (played by the late Denholm Elliot) and Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery). It's I think the best scene to show that some 20 years have passed since Indy 3. I liked the look and feel of the movie. Apart from the ending it could have been made in the times before CGI. I liked the action scenes. They didn't give me Oohs and Aahs, but I can imagine I watched the whole movie with a big smile on my face.Okay, then the things that I didn't like. First of all: Karen Allen. Her casting was brilliant. The storyline involving her is okay. But why the hysterical acting? Bad directing I guess. Spielberg should've done better. Although her smile in the scene in which she hears what Indy really thinks of her is both funny and touching. Then Cate Blanchett. Brilliant actress. Good villain. But there was something missing in her performance. Dark humour? A real drive? A love-hate relationship with Indy like with Alison Doody? Or maybe it was a leader in whom she strongly (or fanaticly) believed in. In Raiders and The Last Crusade it was all for the Führer. But the Cold War didn't have great charismatic 'baddies' like Hitler or Stalin. Cate Blanchett does it all for herself and not in the name of a nation or - in her own vision - a greater good. The third and last thing I wasn't particularly fond of was the 'mythical' element in the movie. In the previous movies Indy was in search of religious artefacts. This time it's... well, see for yourself. The ending could have been stolen from an X-Files movie. Not that it spoils the movie or anything. But it was... strange.I watched the movie with my 11 year old son and boy - how he liked the movie. So I guess Spielberg, Ford and Lucas succeeded in making a movie that pleases adults and kids a like. Well done! Indy 4 will be a big hit at the box office. No doubt about it. Spielberg and Lucas did it again!8/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
385,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,Left that movie shaking my head...,3,17 September 2008,"What ever happened to the raw, intense, Indiana Jones Movies of the 1980's?What happened to the raw gory style of faces melting into bone, guys ripping hearts out of their victims, decapitations, the one bullet being shot through several bodies, Guys getting run over by trucks, bad guys getting shredded and grinded, and lastly guys falling off broken bridges and getting devoured by the alligators below? Whatever happened to disgusting scenes such as Monkey Brains and eyeball soup? Kingdom of Crystal Skull had none of these raw elements.This movie is the biggest mockery of the whole franchise. Were they trying to attract little children too? PG rating should have been more appropriate for this weak film. With the abuse of Computer Graphics, Spielberg and Lucas did their best to make Indiana Jones look like a light hearted Disney Cartoon. I barely tolerated the title: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. What was really over the top was Shia LaBeouff playing Tarzan swinging on computer generated vines with computer generated monkeys and then there was the computer generated Space Alien which was Uber-Cheezy.Remember the special on USA: "" Movie's for Guys who like Movies""? Well this movie definitely isn't one of them. Take your 4 year old kid to see this but don't embarrass yourself by watching this alone.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
386,fred-houpt,"Hugely entertaining, you get all your money's worth.",9,3 June 2008,"It never ceases to amaze me how people dissect films like this on a plot level. Why do they start, why do they persist? It is foolishness. You cannot honestly believe that finding plot holes in a fantasy amounts to any brownie points. It is a movie, it is a fantasy, it is not history, it is not even close to the story of Anna Mitchell-Hedges. Leave all of the analysis at home please and just enjoy this film for all of its entertainment value.Speaking of the late Mitchell-Hedges, I had the supreme joy of seeing her and her wondrous crystal skull many years ago. Out in the basement of a library in the Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario area. She gave a public lecture and had the skull in the center of the stage. After her talk and slide show she let everyone who wanted to, to come up on stage to look closely at the skull.....well, of course I did.It was incredible and mesmerizing. It was life sized, clear and pure and beyond my understanding, wet to the touch. It had the feeling of deep familiarity to me and I felt silly feeling it. All that I will say more on the skull is that it exists, it is hard to put into words other than to say it has an unworldly feeling about it and it is very, very powerful.The last Indy film was quite fun and like all such venues, very entertaining. I'll be sure to buy a copy for home and enjoy it for years to come. Well done to Spielberg, Lucas, Ford and Company (no pun intended). Worth the wait for. Indy is back....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
387,Deckard-16,99.97 % Pure Spielberg Magic,9,28 May 2008,"What a kick this movie is to watch. It is clearly better than the Last Crusade and --depending upon your tastes (mine tend toward the dark)-- it matches Doom.I have loved Spielberg's turn toward the darker/heavier side, but it is nice to watch a movie whose only subtext is ""just have more fun"". Ford is as good as ever as Indy, but the only other actor to stand out for me is Cate Blanchett who seems to be having a blast playing the main baddie.Make no mistake about it this is Spielberg's movie. I have long been awed by his talent and he doesn't slack here. Aside from a pointless sword fight scene atop vehicles careening thru a jungle the action is breathtaking. (The mine car chase in Doom is still the best set piece in the 4 movies.) It also features perhaps the best death scene of a villain of the 4 and I'll just say that it'll creep you out.The craftsmanship is peerless. Although is not quite as exhilarating as the 1st 2 movies it is a warm fan-pleasing 2+ hours with tons of excitement.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
388,de_niro_2001,Never too old! (Spoilers),10,26 June 2008,"Indy seems here to be putting into practice the lesson he learned in German East Africa while pursuing the Phantom Train of Doom. One is only as old as one feels. He's every bit as much of an action hero as he was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. All the essential elements are here. An ancient mystery, militaristic villains, fights during chases in army trucks, creepy crawlies, lost tombs full of human remains, the Paramount logo morphing into something else (in this film a prairie dog hill) and a grisly death for the villain. There are references to the previous three films and also the Young Indiana Jones television series. It would have been nice to have seen Sean Connery reprising his role as Professor Henry Jones but Sir Sean is quite adamant he has retired from films and when he says no he means no. Nice to have the tributes to the late Denholm Elliott in the form of the portrait and statue of Marcus Brody on the university campus. This film rounds off very well a marvellous series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
389,Beard_Of_Serpico,Kind of sad really.,4,6 October 2019,"I love the original Indiana Jones trilogy, they're fun action adventure movies with lots of stunts, funny dialogue, likeable characters and Harrison Ford in his leading man prime and they're directed by Steven Spielberg who has an awesome track record of great movies.So decades later someone thought it would be a good idea to make a 4th Indie movie even though Harrison Ford was 66 years old at the time. He's a great actor but my suspension of disbelief goes flies out the window seeing him as an action star and the script loves to remind you that he is passed his prime with him saying things like ""I'm too old for this"" or ""This used to be easier"". It feels very forced.One of the best things about the original trilogy is the stunt work as the majority of the stunts and special effects are done using real performers and practicals so everything looks believable and exciting. In this one though there's an over-reliance on CGI and it just looks bad. It takes you right out of the movie and looks like a cartoon or a videogame cutscene.Maybe this was because Ford was too old to do his own stunts or George Lucas had too much of a say in how the movie was made, everyone knows how he loves to throw as many CGI effects on screen as he can.Also these movies have always contained supernatural elements but as a whole are based in reality whereas there's so much wacky stuff going on in Crystal Skull that it feels like a parody. There's one scene where Jones is sinking in quicksand so someone uses a snake as a rope to pull him out of it. I'm surprised there wasn't a rubber ""Boing!"" when they did it.I'm not even going to talk about all of the stuff involving aliens.....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
390,movieman89-2,Disappointing,4,14 December 2008,"I was really looking forward to seeing this but when i watched it, I was disappointed.There were loads of scenes with bad CGI that there where was no need. Lots of the script was too cheesy, not in a good way.The main point of the adventure was aliens from another dimension, Im sorry but Indiana Jones and aliens do not mix.Wasn't very impressed with Kate Blanchet as the main villain, her Russian accsent always dropped when saying ""Jones"". I was impressed that they brought Marion back though.Shire Labouf did OK, but looked too much like James Dean. Harrison Ford was really good, no surprise there.Had a few cool, original Indiana moments but the rest was too modern in a bad way.Wish they could of done better, nowhere near as good as the other three. The worst in the quadrilogy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
391,rowanmaillot,Harshly Disappointing..,5,6 June 2020,"I grew up a big Indiana Jones fan and Steven Spielberg fan so I went into this film with the highest expectations possible, expecting an epic blockbuster movie! And I was harshly disappointed, not to say this film is like The Room or anything, in fact, it's pretty far from it, the script is written very poorly. When it feels like a Steven Spielberg movie, it's pretty kick-ass, but most of the time it feels like a crappy Michael Bay movie due to Koepp's poor script.However, Harrison Ford delivers a good performance, some of the dialogue is very cheesy (in an okay way) and overall the action scenes are pretty cool, but Cate Blanchett's character is very boring and uninteresting and should've been replaced by another actress. However, I love the addition of the Marion character from Raiders of the Lost Ark because she was an awesome female lead and not like a usual, weak movie female. I disagree with people calling this one of the worst movie sequels, but it is DEFINITELY the most disappointing one.Four of the greatest things in this movie are:
1. Spielberg's direction
2. Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones
3. The addition of the Marion character
4. Shia LeBouf's performance (yeah, I know right?)Four of the biggest issues in this movie are:
1. Cate Blanchett's character
2. Weak script
3. Pretentious dialogue
4. George Lucas's poor storytellingOverall, I feel the positives ever-so-slightly outweigh the negatives, which is why I have decide to give Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a B-",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
392,clivey6,"It's not the age, it's the baggage",5,25 May 2008,"It's not as bad a belated sequel as Sean Connery's comeback in Never Say Never Again, rather, this is typical of the fourth film in a franchise - recall Lethal Weapon and Die Harder - in that it's not allowed to fail. It's all action, crammed in, some of it deliberately OTT and quite implausible as if to say, okay kids, are we done now? And there are so many characters tagging along, as Indy might say ""It's not the age, it's the baggage..."" For Last Crusade the tag line was 'and this time, he's bringing his Dad!' Here he brings his best mate (who we've never seen before), son, son's Mom, and work colleague. It's all too much.I couldn't hear the dialogue too well - I wonder if Spielberg does this sometimes, he makes you strain to hear the words, it was the same at the opening of Temple of Doom and parts of Jurassic Park. It's also the case in big blockbusters I find: the last two Bonds and the Pirates franchise, but never with bog standard fare like Forgetting Sarah Marshall.It's a problem as there's an awful lot of verbiage in this, real long-winded exposition delivered by Ford in his trademark 'you can type this sh1t, George, but you sure can't say it' expression. The problem is, of course, that unlike the Ark of the Covenent or the Holy Grail, we need more explanation about the Crystal Skulls like what they are, where they came from, who's been after them and their power yadda yadda... It's Exposition City and for 10-15 mins it seems Ford is just explaining to Shia LaBoeuf about all this, real boring stuff. Even having seen the film I'm no wiser, I couldn't care less and I get the sense Spielberg and Ford didn't either, they just went along with Lucas so they could get to make another Indy film before the sun sets. It all had that Phantom Menace feel; the audience shows up all eager and willing but no, George has to give us some lecture and the feeling ebbs away.The intro is great, all 1950s Americana like Richard Donner's Superman (but all films reference each other these days) but I struggled with Indy in this era, it felt interesting but wrong. His hat and whip getup felt right for the wartime era. Having Mutt as a biker like Marlon Brando was too obvious a cultural reference and it's jarring. It's like Back to the Future in reverse, when the 1950s set small town vibe should be more The Last Picture Show. That's the difference between movie kitsch and genuine poignancy.As for the Russians as villains, well, they're not Nazis are they? Cate Blanchett's ESP power (mindreading) didn't go anywhere at all. She's great but I did expect some older guy to head up in charge of it all, she was more like a henchwoman albeit a damn good one. A Rosa Klebb figure would have been cool - this film is set in the year of the novel From Russia With Love, after all. Mention of McCarthyism didn't quite fit a film where the Russians are in fact shown to be almost as diabolical as the Nazis, you can't quite have it both ways...What did I like? Well the opener was good, though I think you should know the warehouse has nothing to do with the Ark of the Covenant do don't go expecting the ghosts to swirl about as before. The action scene after that was incredible, surreal, eerie, weird, a total blast... That said, other scenes couldn't possibly top it.Most of the action was very derivative (and Indy never rides a horse, which I later pinpointed as a drawback). Much of it borrows from the worst of the Moore Bond films, namely Moonraker and Octopussy silliness. All these characters turn up and as another poster said, it's like some family adventure. Karen Allen - SEXISM ALERT! - isn't really some damsel in distress, she's a Mom, it's not the same. Didn't see have a huskier voice in Raiders? Really she should be more the wiry Kathleen Hepburn (spot the movie injoke no 1, film fans!) type, but she's more Diane Keaton here.Ray Winstone's character I found annoying, I never believed he and Indy were mates. As an earlier character of his might have confided in biker LaBoef, ""They treat you like a lump of sh*t don't they..."" (Spot the movie Injoke no 2, film fans)John Hurt annoyed the hell out of me, his staring into space ruminations reminded me of Spike Milligan's luckless, unheeded prophet in Monty Python's Life of Brian. I'm glad Connery didn't show up for this, it's another League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in a way. You could only redeem it by casting Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in it, and having a couple of singing and dancing numbers. Ford is okay, though Lucus gives him too much to say (he's a strong silent type) and his slow-witted, baffled countenance, once pleasingly paradoxical in a virile leading man, now makes him look like the old guy.I generally wish that Spielberg and Ford had gone ahead with the Indy 4 script that Lucas had vetoed. Maybe former Nazis in South America, with the Red Army on the sidelines. And a European city somewhere, like Venice in Crusade. This one felt all bunched in to a story only Lucas wanted to tell.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The Ugly: Harrison Ford and Karen Allen. Some people just don't know when to quit; an idiotic story line. This movie is a total loss. Nothing buta self-referential ego trip with a very poor script and some over-the-hill acting.What I would like to come out of this film is more serious work for Igor Jijikine.

394,tml_pohlak_13,"Not the best in the series, but fun to watch",8,12 March 2009,"There has been a lot of negative hype surrounding this film. It's understandable, but hey! It's Indiana Jones! What is there not to like? Harrison still hasn't lost his touch as the hero, I loved him!Since 19 years have passed, the Nazis are long gone, and Harrison is older. So instead of trying to pass off Harrison as 19 years younger and resurrecting the Nazis, Spielberg and Lucas introduced the Russians instead, and set it in the 50s. Either you love this, or you hate it, and I love it! Irina Spalko is really reminiscent of Rosa Klebb (from the Bond movie/book From Russia With Love). Cate Blanchett did a really good job!As for Mac well, he's not the greatest character in the series. Great concept for his character, but that accent really threw me off! (The actor seemed to be nearly mumbling his lines at times, it was hard to understand him at certain points.)Now, on to Mutt Williams, played by Shia LaBeouf (damn, his name is hard to spell!). Again, either you love his character or you hate him. I personally liked him a lot as Indy's sidekick, but if Lucas plans to make him the lead in the possible Indy 5, I might skip out. The only scene involving Mutt I didn't like was when he was swinging from the vines along with the monkeys. I mean, come on! The stunts may have been far-fetched or cheesy in the first 3 Indy films, but not that much!Finally, Marion Ravenwood reappears, played by Karen Allen again. Now I see why Spielberg and Lucas had a different ""Indy girl"" in each of the first three movies. Why, oh why? What have they done to Marion? Where is that feisty girl who could outdrink any man in a heartbeat? She's been reduced to a ""soccer mom"" (especially when Mutt and Spalko fence on the trucks, and she keeps correcting his stance). It was tragic to see her reduced to such a role.John Williams, as usual, composed a brilliant score to piece this movie together.Indy 4 has some of the good, the bad, and the ugly, but overall, I liked it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
395,jantoniou,I missed you Indy... I still miss you,6,17 June 2008,"Suffocated by an unwieldy and impossibly bizarre plot--authored, no doubt, by Mr. Lucas (he is listed as the story creator)--this latest, long-awaited ""Indy"" is an assault of action sequences, twisting and hard-to-follow plot lines, and a vague introduction of perhaps a successor to Dr. Jones.The core plot is a meandering bailiwick that I would explain if I had the intellectual capacity to, but even if I had the inherent brainpower to unravel Mr. Lucas' wild ride, I am not sure it would be to anyone's great benefit. The plot is more of a servile rag doll for the purposes of setting up what are often overwrought action sequences, especially the final few.The fun of the original few movies seems drained by Harrison Ford's rather curmudgeonly now '50s-era Dr. Jones. The boundless enthusiasm that Ford had in ""Raiders,"" for example, is nowhere in evidence in ""Crystal Skull."" Rather, he seems to begrudgingly act his scenes out.Is ""Crystal Skull"" entertaining and perhaps worth the investment you made to go see it? Probably. But what I am disappointed in is the lack of enthusiasm and the mastery of both plot AND story AND action that Spielberg and Lucas once displayed for their work. They seem as a collective to almost trudge through their task, waiting, it seems, to pick up the big check at the end of the day. Spielberg is a master craftsman no doubt, but his artistry and consummate understanding of the film making format is desperately lost here. And, given the incipient ""Star Wars"" series, it is clear that Lucas long ago lost his edge in film production and directing.Shia Labouef comes off well enough in the movie. The fast-talking enthusiasm he had in Transformers, Even Stevens, Holes, and so on is here. He seems to be one-note so far as an actor, but it works fine for this type of movie. Cate Blanchett chews her scenes the best of them all.Overall, I was hoping for much more but what I think I saw was a team of great actors and filmmakers at the ebb of their career, swimming in huge budgets that douse you with action but leave you feeling empty and unfulfilled at the end - kind of like the Chinese food school of film making.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Well, I wasn't disappointed when I left the cinema, so that's something. It's hard to consider Indy IV as all the usual ways that I'd look at a movie seem redundant, somehow. It has moments that are utterly preposterous (nuke vs fridge, for example); the 'plot' is as detailed as an adult movie, essentially used to carry us from one implausible set-piece to the next; aside from Indy and Mutt, most of the actors don't really get enough screen time, and it all ends up wrapped up with a neat little bow at the end. But surely that was the point? It's exactly as dumb and just about as fun as the original trilogy, does not disappoint on any score (nor on the score  thanks again, great king John Williams) and is, I'd say, at least as good as Last Crusade if never quite as awesome as Raiders or preposterous as Temple of Doom.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
397,CalDexter,"I lowered my expectations, and still found it disappointing.",6,30 June 2008,"After reading some comments on the IMDb, i tried to go into this film having lowered my expectation that it would be a Masterpiece, that the action would be amazing, that the latest chase for Fortune and glory would be just as interesting as the story of The Ark and the Holy Grail or that it could be as hilarious and frightening as Temple Of Doom. Sadly, VERY sadly i have to say that Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is just slightly better than your average National Treasure flick.Thankfully, Harrison Ford has still got it as Indiana Jones. It was such a good idea to portray him as a much older man struggling with all the stunts and bravado that was once something he did with ease. The first twenty minutes were pretty good. Then the Doom Town/Nuclear Bomb/Lead Fridge scene happened. I found that bit very surreal, with Indy running around a false suburb with dummies slouched in the houses' sitting rooms. In fact, for me that was one of the highlights of this film. The nuclear blast scene was crazy, but it was a visual feast which couldn't save the rest of the film.It all starts to trip up once Indy and his latest sidekick Mutt Williams team up and go looking for the mysterious Crystal Skull. Now other IMDb members have also stated how bored they were when they are walking about the ruins of an old burial site or something, and Indy starts to explain at length something that i can't even remember now! The one liners aren't much either 'Drop Dead Comrade'??? and if you don't know your political history of the 1950s then forget about 'I like Ike' The film only has two strong points. The motorcycle chase is Indiana Jones Heaven. It is well done and all good stunt work...and okay, the red ants sequence is CGI and all that crap, but its still a gruesome scene (and utterly silly). The rest of the film does not feel like a Steven Spielberg film.Note i said that. A Steven Spielberg film is Jaws, Close Encounters, The original Indy Trilogy, ET and (not my cup of tea) the awful Jurrasic Park. After that, Spielberg was done with 'event' blockbusters. Schindler's List changed Spielberg forever. Think about this, he made his first sequel to a film that was a success on the strength of its CGI Dinosaurs, he also made films that no one went to see: A.I. for example, and then the mediocre Minority Report and the utter pants remake of War Of The Worlds. Saving Private Ryan is the best Spielberg has made since The Last Crusade. Its easy to see that Spielbergian touch is sadly missing in this film.The music score is basically a rehash of all thats gone before, its fine, but John Williams always brought some new theme to each instalment, here hes just going through the motions, almost like David Arnold does with his James Bond film scores.I was actually thinking of going to see it again, but then i remembered all the boring bits and that utterly tripe performance from John Hurt as a mad professor and the pointless character that Ray Winstone played...and its giving me second thoughts. Giving it 6 out of 10, simply because the OT are three of the greatest adventure films ever made. I would recommend that IF there is to be a fifth film, then they start with a good script and more action stunts, more humour and less CGI falsehoods.As of 3/7/08 I've seen it on the big screen a second time, i liked it better. Special mention must go to Cate Blancett as Spalko, there is something mesmerising about her in this film...maybe its that boiler suit Russian uniform.Heres another flaw. Who the hell is Oxley? Im one of these Indy fans that believe the Indiana Jones universe revolves around the movies only, i point blank refuse to indulge in that silly TV show about him as a teen, no thanks. Was Oxley ever referred to in this show? Or was it just another clichéd character to explain who helped raise Mutt Williams? John Hurt was both wasted and terrible in this part. I felt sorry for him.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

That's what it is supposed to do.Doctor Jones is at it again, just as we love.Yes, the film and script does swerve a little off the formula, but not near as bad as 'Temple of Doom', and delivers Indy to a genre we hadn't imagined.. Sci-Fi. So, aliens and Russians instead of Nazi's and Christ Almighty. It still works.Now, Indy's calling to Junior.. it works.. if not in some corny reversal.He's still Doctor Jones, named after the dog and saving the free world from the forces of whatever earthly or other worldly evil threatens us... all in the name of archeology.And what a wonderful gift we may have in the form of Indy's WWII adventures in the form of pre-quels... ah but to challenge Lucas and Spielberg just a little more.Adventure epic.. popcorn and no breaks.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
399,andro-dolic,Good but .....,6,26 March 2010,....what went wrong ? 1. Movie is totally adventurous but where is here excitements . I didn't spend 2 hours for watching Harrison Ford who is beating whole Russian expedition and doesn't it look stupid when such old guy is fighting like he is as young as some professional gymnastic challenger . Is he bulletproof ? 2. There are so many needless scenes and moves and this is so childish movies . Maybe there are some action movements but isn't it frivolous when you know that this movie is some adventurous game . Where is this imagination where is this magic excitements .3. I don't know is it useful to watch how some kid (Shia LeBouf) understood that Jones is his father . This is something what is the most stupid adventure . Why so bad?,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
400,MRavenwood,Suffer Through it Once,5,27 May 2008,"When I hand over my box office ticket to the ticket taker at the theatre, I view that as a contract. I agree to suspend my disbelief. Unfortunately, there's an area beyond what could be considered believable inside the parameters of a given movie, especially a sequel. In this case, two very wealthy filmmakers have allowed themselves to step over this threshold. The movie makers abuse the audience by refusing to do some basic rewriting of scenes to bring it from laughingly, goof-ballishly impossible, to improbable, but juuuust maybe...I will not spoil the plot with details of the scenes I am referring to. Once you see it, you'll know what I mean anyway. The film also suffers from a distinct lack of close-ups and reaction takes. It feels soulless without them. It is almost as if they suits said, ""Who cares about chemistry and characters? Give me chase scenes!"" And speaking of chase scenes... lots of them. Long and boring. Or I should say, ""pointless"". Even the bad guys aren't sexy or scary! Who was in charge of that? Harrison Ford is a hard-working and very talented actor. Why'd they even hire him? They totally wasted him in this film. They wrote an overly stunt-intensive script when they have a lead actor who is exciting standing still. It feels like the script does not have enough focus on him and his energy. The way they used ""the kid"" was not engaging to me and felt intrusive, not sweet. Wait, that's not all. The design of the crystal skull is so stupid, you're going to laugh. It just looks really last-minute. It looks like something they would rehearse with, not a real prop. Crucially, no one reminded the actors that a crystal or glass object of that size would weigh a good twenty pounds. They were shifting and tossing it like a 12-ounce box of Nilla Wafers. And it didn't really ""do"" much. So how could they have made this film better? TWO WORDS: ""girl fight"". It's a natural with Harrison Ford and two female leads. Especially when one of the women has a famous right-cross sucker punch. There is no sexual tension in this movie at all. The logical plot device should have been: villain develops the hots for Indy, kid has crush on sexy villain, Indy has heart set on Marion who he cannot win because of past disappointments. I wanted to like this film and went in with pretty low expectations, and I was even disappointed on top of that. If you're a big fan, suffer through it once and call it good.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
401,irish23,Lucas and Spielburg miss the point -- again,2,8 June 2008,"I was a huge fan of ""Raiders"" but thought the ensuing sequels were drivel. This sequel is, alas, Drivel III.The problems with the SCRIPT are non-stop. Absurd situations, an unbelievable amount of exposition by Jones (was all this lecturing necessary in other pictures??), flat dialogue, and plot holes. HARRISON FORD cannot transcend his original creation. I found his performance painful. He was never rooted in the character, flowing naturally from an internal connection to who Jones is. Instead, he skims the surface, in many cases reeling off lines with the inflection and rhythm of someone who will never get off the B-list. I kept flashing back to Return of the Jedi, when everyone was sick of the franchise and was just going through the motions. (It didn't help that the writers flashed back, too, giving Indy lines straight out of Han Solo's vocabulary. Bad move.) His reaction to news of his son is virtually non-existent. Even over- the-top William Shatner did a more believable job in Star Trek II under similar circumstances. Ford's *complete* lack of reaction to a nuclear bomb detonation was insulting. KAREN ALLEN gave a great performance as Marion. Her portrayal of the character made a perfect arc from Raiders. All this talk of Allen's perpetual grinning -- it made total sense to me. Here's a woman who's lived life to the fullest, been everywhere, seen everything, and has been more ""tethered"" once she had her son. Now she's not only reunited with an old flame, she's reunited with a life that meets her lust for adventure -- I'd be grinning like an idiot, too! She looked like she was having a blast, grabbing life by the throat and throttling it, rather than just passively reacting. Her momming of Mutt was true to character -- not sentimental but straightforward and smart. Karen Allen was, like everyone else, given bad material, but fills out the sparse lines and absurd situations with utter glee.SHIA LaBEOUF was fine. Nothing out of character but nothing to make the character distinctive, textured, or to make you want to know more. His first appearance as Marlon Brando was an incredibly bad script/directorial choice, since his lack of intensity was only made clearer when you've seen the real Brando.CATE BLANCHETT was wasted. Her character DIDN'T HAVE ANY POWER. She's supposed to be the villain! What the heck was scary about her?? She's supposed to be psychic -- yet never successfully demonstrates it. She carries a sword -- in 1957?? Her main asset seems to be her ability to speak English and command her endlessly-replenished troops. All that's left is to maintain stereotypical Russian fatalism, strike a couple Garbo/Dietrich poses, and get Wicked Witched in the end.The worst thing about this picture is, like so many others from the Spielburg/Lucas ""dream team,"" is that it's lost its connection to the Big Picture. What makes any picture great is that it works on more than one level. ""Crystal Skull"" can be seen once & never again. It could've been summed up in a paragraph on a fan site and saved everyone time/money. All it does is explain how Marion and Jones split up and reunited.""Raiders"" is a far more compelling picture for a host of reasons. While both Raiders and Crystal Skull are hero movies, Raiders connects the hero's trials to a much larger battle between good and evil. And there's nobody like Nazis for villains! Everyone understands on a visceral level why it's a bad idea for Hitler to get hold of a mysterious superweapon. But is it terrifying to us today, in a world where Russia has become politically irrelevant and Communism some historical hiccup or abstraction, for Russian Commies to do the same in 1957? No. It simply doesn't work.As unbelievable as the bad guys are, the ""ultimate power"" is even worse. In Raiders, the ultimate power is the God of the Torah. That's somebody most Americans are familiar with regardless of religious tradition. ""God"" is ever-present in American society, and most Americans accept the concept that he is a transcendent, all-powerful force. Most Americans feel a personal relationship to him.And the equivalent in Crystal Skull is -- ALIENS?? Please! While we can certainly believe in the possibility of extraterrestrial life, few people would claim a personal relationship with an alien. We're immediately one step removed emotionally from the transcendent force in the film. That's a bad place to be. Beyond the question of ""good vs evil,"" Raiders had an even greater theme -- the dedication to scientific ideals. In one of its best scenes, Bellog calls Indy's bluff, telling him to go ahead and blow up the Ark. And even though Indy loves Marion to his bones, he cannot -- will not -- allow an individual life to be traded for history itself. *That* is great drama, and a great test for a hero. It's not about jumping from vehicle to vehicle and punching people in the face -- it's about moral choices and taking the consequences. That meta-level understanding of the Hero Story is totally lacking in Crystal Skull. So is the fabulous ambiguity of Bellog, the nauseating creepiness of Toht, or the multi-dimensionality of sidekick Sallah. It even lacks the little touches that made Raiders so believable -- like the idea that Indy actually gets cuts and bruises! Indy gets tired, Indy despairs, but in the end, Indy keeps fighting. Those are humanizing touches that connect us with the character and continue to suspend our disbelief. An Indy who walks through a bone-crushing waterfall and comes out fresh and dry is not believable. It's boring.Crystal Skull fails conceptually, is preposterous in script, is uneven in acting, and demonstrates bad directorial choices. It's a regrettable end to a timeless story.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
402,GethinVanH,Disappointing and different,3,18 June 2008,"This movie is a huge disappointment. What makes these movies great is the story and the writing in ""Crystal Skull"" is dreadful. I'm not sure what I expect from a Spielberg film anymore especially one written by David Koepp who wrote such dreadful scripts as the Jurassic Park: The Lost World and War of the Worlds. The mythical treasure that Indiana is always after is fantastical but never out of the realm of belief. I always enjoyed the historical, anthropological aspect of the story and here that theme is definitely missing.Here, the story goes over the deep end and treads into the science fiction genre. I was never left with any thrills and there weren't any moments that stood out. The original movies always had at least one classic sequence.This is a completely superfluous film to the original trilogy. I would recommend forgetting including it when you think of Indiana Jones. But it doesn't take anything away from the original films which will always stand out as classics on their own.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
403,randomStuff101,"Over-done, extremely far-fetched, tries too hard to be bigger and better",5,25 May 2008,"Sadly, this latest Indiana Jones movie is not nearly as cool or unique or interesting in story, characters or action as the previous offerings.Something has been lost in modern film making's pursuit of ""bigger and better"". Attempts to make the biggest and best special effects scenes have negative consequences. Story becomes the casualty, left behind, or tacked on as an after-thought. Rather than build a movie around a good story, it's the other way around... the story is forced into a preprepared mold of dazzling action scenes, and the result is an under-whelming movie experience that leaves you feeling something is missing. There has always been a super-natural or magical element to this series, but none so extreme as this latest offering. It takes the story elements too far, and pushes you - the humble human viewer - so far away from this world, that you're left feeling disconnected and alienated from the whole thing.Not only that, but so many of the action sequences are so unrealistic, so unbelievable. Every second stunt is another cringe-worthy sequence obviously impossible to achieve in real-life, or even with real stunt crews. Characters come to near-death so often, but come out without a scratch.. or in the next scene they are back to perfect looking makeup, and clean clothes. Where is the grit? Where has the genuine, honest film making and story-telling gone? CGI effects can work very well, but can also turn a good action movie into a cartoon. Even if the CGI is seamless, it becomes like a cartoon in that the scenes before you are clearly not ones that were filmed with a camera, but assembled on a computer - where anything is possible, so the film makers exploit this, and the story suffers as a result. More alienation, and more disappointment.5 / 10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
404,gerrythree,"Indiana Jones #4 Is Played Out, For All The Action Sequences",6,25 May 2008,"The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a movie with a bad story, a tired director and an old star, Harrison Ford. Ford could play Indiana Jones in his sleep, but in this movie, he does a workman-like job, he goes through the paces just as well as he did in the previous Indiana Jones movies. Director Spielberg is the big letdown, he has lost all idea of the importance a story has in making a good movie. The Crystal Skull's storyline is so bad, the key scene at the end identifying the source of the crystal skull is a near copy of what happens in the 1987 Sam Hui Hong Kong movie The Legend of Wisely. That is something, Spielberg copying from an HK movie that was in itself a copy in theme from Raiders of the Lost Ark.Crystal Skull's thrill ride sequences cannot cover up the way Spielberg constructed the movie, taking parts from previous Indiana Jones movies as if he were ordering a meal in a Chinese restaurant. One item from column A, Raiders, hmm, that item from column B, Last Crusade. That scene in The Mummy involving ravenous scarab beetles looked good, lets transplant it here during the seemingly never ending jungle chase sequence. This movie fits the definition of an elephant that describes the animal as one created by a committee.Somewhere along the line, Hollywood seems to have lost totally the ability to create big movies that are also interesting movies. There is a lot of noise and destruction in Crystal Skull, but to what purpose? The thin plot involving a Russian KGB agent is totally lame. At one point early on, Jones is thought to be a suspect by the FBI. After Jones brags about his wartime medals, that plot line fizzles out, the FBI just tarnishes Jones' reputation with his school.Maybe Spielberg can go back to the drawing board and try to make a part five to the series that is more than a comic book filled with chase scenes and shallow dialog. That may be too much to ask of him.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
405,jfcthejock,A Brilliant Film Pure & Simple,8,15 June 2008,"OK, let's begin. First of all this is a sequel of one of the greatest film franchises in this world, the Indiana Jones film series which in my view is in the same league as Star Wars. Harrison Ford returns as the archaeologist hero Indiana Jones, who comes back at us in another outing of action and adventure. This time taking on a well known cast including Ray Winston, John Hurt and Cate Blanchett who all give great performances.Special effects and the CGI do wonders to this film and make it look even more mesmerising. The story and plot are excellent to say the least, but i will not say or expose much. Again this film makes for one of the highlights of 2008 alongside The Incredible Hulk and even Ironman.

406,Red_Flag,More Temple of Doom than Raider of the Lost ark.,6,25 May 2008,"Indies back after a nineteen year wait. We've all grown up but the question is has he? Or more accurately has Spielberg and Lucas? Perfect marks for faithfulness, there's no doubt this is an Indiana flick, but on originally it scores a big fat zero. Not quite in the same league as series best Raiders of the Lost Ark and lagging behind much loved third outing The Last Crusade. The Crystal Skull sits at the right hand of fun, but forgettable second helping The Temple of Doom.If there anything that Crystal Skull does better than all three of them it's on the stellar and well used cast. Ford stunning as usual but its newcomers Shia LaBeouf and shimmering villainess Cate Blanchett who really stand out. While her Russian leader strikes fear into the heart of most audience member the whole Russian fiasco simply isn't as brilliant as that of the much scarier Nazis. So as for the plot you may as well forget about it. Not for what this series does best. The action sequences are like no other flitting from some of the most Impressive set pieces I have ever witnessed. It's never boring watching Ford and LaBeouf swinging from branches and beating the bad guys. So as an action film Indie really delivers.Everyone's favorite archaeologist adventurer dusts off his hat and trusty whip for yet another globe trotting trek as Indiana Jones returns to the big screen nearly 20 years after racing for the Holy Grail alongside his father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade alongside his father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Harrison Ford reprises his role as the iconic, snake-loathing screen hero in a sequel that also finds Karen Allen returning to the series for the first time since 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark. Ray Winstone, John Hurt, Jim Broadbent, and Shia LaBeouf round out a cast that also features Cate Blanchett in the role of villainous Russian operative Agent Irina Spalko.Stephen Spielberg's direction is unmistakably over the top reminiscent of that in the Temple of Doom. Personally we would have preferred another raider of hell even another Last Crusade. But if this is the best were getting after a nineteen year wait I'm disappointed for sure but the end result really is very Impressive, nothing like the haters leads us to believe. But also nothing like the Spielberg diehards boasted. In all its a good looking romp that often skips on plotting and pacing but never compromises its solid characters.When you think about it, all the pre-release concern about just how good the new Indy was going to be, though understandable, is not completely rational. After all, given its Saturday matinée genre nature and the fact that star Ford, creator Lucas, director Spielberg, composer John Williams and editor Michael Kahn, among others, have all returned, it was inevitable that this film was going to fall within a very narrow range in terms of quality. It was either going to be a worse- or better-than-average Indiana Jones film. Honestly its better than.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
407,Jetset971,Weakest Indy flick of them all,3,17 August 2008,"(Long Sigh) Folks, Allow to be completely candid and frank about the latest Indy flick, it just flat out does not work. In fact I have had my reservations about this movie since I heard about its release. To be thourough I have comprised a list of the biggest problems in this movie. Here we go...1). HARRISON FORD. I was so hoping that if they made a sequel this far along they would be smart enough to realize that Harrison Ford is a man in his sixties. All the makeup and lighting tricks in Hollywood can not disguise the fact the Harrison is a senior citizen. Don't get me wrong, This is not ageism. The fact is that that Mr. Ford should have played Indy at the appropriate age, not running, jumping, fighting like he still is a young man. That's what the character of ""Mutt"" should have been doing more of. In this movie, they don't give Mutt nearly enough action, He should be picking up the lion's share of the stunts and yet Indy is still doing things that a twenty year old Olympic gymnist would have trouble doing. Remember ""Last Crusade""? You didn't see Sean Connery leaping on horses or beating up bad guys every other clip. You know why? Because he was in his sixties then and was too old to be realistically doing all that physicality. I really hoped from the get-go that they would have side-steped this no-brainer of a concept. They should have had Indy more like his father. Semi-Retired Professor that pitches in on the action, at times, but leaves the rough stuff to the young kid.2). WHOLEY IMPOSSIBLE STUNTS. I know that Indiana Jones, in the previous movies, was prone to pull off and get out off amazingly difficult situations. Although they were far-fetched at times, you still could believe that this was still in the the realm of realism and possibility, remote possibility, but still possible. In this latest Indy flick, however, some of the stunts were completely unrealistic and frankly insulting for the audience. The most egregious and irritating stunt, to me, was one that I couldn't believe Spielberg and Lucas could even believe would work. See if you think this is plausible, Indy is in the middle of a mock created town in New Mexico, He hears Sirens blare and realizes that a hydrogen bomb is about to be tested on this town. So what does he do? He runs into a kitchen and crawls into a Lead refrigerator and the nuclear blast rockets him 40 miles into the desert. The Fridge is bang up and burnt but Indy comes out without so much as a mark on him. Sorry folks, Even Indiana Jones cannot survive a nuclear blast even when he is in a lead refrigerator. What's Next? Indiana Jones finds himself in the vacuum of space and uses a plastic bag to keep breathing and not decompress?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
408,treeskier802,I'm On The Fence Over This Film - Advise To Wait For DVD Release,6,2 June 2008,"First of all, let me say I would have rather waited and paid for a DVD rental for this film. As movie prices get higher and higher, I try to select films that will be very good. This film was mediocre at best.For any fan of the Indiana Jones series, this movie was a must see. The storyline resembled that of the other Indy films, with perhaps an influence from the National Treasure films in that there seemed to be more investigating to get to the Skulls than what we had seen in other Indy films. The action was again, over-the-top, much of it unbelievable. Obviously, an interesting aspect of the film is how Indian Jones and Karen Allen's character changed over the 20 years from Raiders to Crystal Skull. Both have mellowed tremendously. In some ways, this is a good thing because it is realistic. However, it also takes away what made these movies so charming. The antagonistic banter between Ford and his heroine.If you are a big fan, you will go and enjoy the movie because it is part of the series. If you are someone who has seen the films, but is not a die-hard fan, then wait for the DVD release. Rating 6 of 10 stars.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
409,pootc,"Undoubtedly, the weakest",6,22 May 2008,"It was the perfect ending. Indiana Jones rides off into the sunset with having found 'illumination' with his Holy Grail - his beloved father and closet friends by his side in what concluded the much beloved trilogy of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984) and the Last Crusade (1989).Its nineteen years later and we're thrust into the atomic age with a bang! Red hysteria has gripped the United States and also Dr. Jones's personal life, pitting him against the Russians in search for the mysterious crystal skull of Akator. Director Steven Spielberg, producer George Lucas and Ford return for the fourth in the series in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".The cast is rounded out by Shia Labeouf, a leather clad greaser who seeks out Indy. Ray Winstone as Jone's war buddy Mac, John Hurt as Professor Harold Oxley, Karen Allen as the returning Marion Ravenwood (from Raiders) and Cate Blanchett as the villainous Irina Spalko.Crystal Skull has its moments of genuine fun and dialogue. Ford clearly loves this character and doesn't miss a beat. Blanchett as Spalko wasn't my favorite and the relic of interest is a little strange too - but the story engaged and the action entertained until the very moment it didn't. That moment comes during what should have been a thrilling chase sequence through the jungle.Unfortunately it's so poorly executed and saturated in bad ideas and effects, it effectively ruins the movie. Monkeys, why'd it have to be monkeys?Compared to the truck chase in Raiders, the mine carts in Temple or the tank sequence in the Last Crusade this was a letdown. Not memorable at all and it gave way to a pretty underwhelming finale too which is again over reliant on effects. As a standalone film it's a pretty good time but as an entry into this franchise royalty, it's undoubtedly the weakest.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
410,antonjsw1,Light-hearted but a let down,7,30 January 2011,"After nearly 20 years off the cinema screens, Indiana Jones returns with this adventure, clearly attempting to play homage to the B movie cold war conspiracy vibe of the 50s. To some degree it succeeds, but there are some flaws that prevent it from being anywhere near as good as Raiders ofthe Lost Ark and the Last Crusade, which are the best of the series.However, it is more entertaining than the Temple of Doom, even if the film making skill is less impressive this time around. The film opens in a similar fashion to the previous films, with a prologue to set up the characters, and it's similar to Raiders in that regard. However, in this film this sequence sets up the film's plot, ratherthan being a different story as was the case in the previous films. The opening sequence of the film is appropriately set in Area 51, which is introduced in a typically clever Spielberg way. There are also a number of clever in jokes and the film quickly leads to a series of action set pieces that are typical of the previous Spielberg Indy films. John Williams has clearly not lost his touch. His score is excellent and is very effective in creating the appropriate atmosphere, while at the same time tipping the hat to the previous films in the series. Harrison Ford is good as usual, but his performance, while humorous at times, feels too introspective to be really involving, and this is because he does not have another character to riff off against effectively. In Raiders he had Karen Allen and Paul Freeman, in Crusade he had Doody, Byrne, Glover and particularly Connery. Karen Allen's return somehow doesn't feel that it really works, and Allen's performance this time around feels to on the nose and obvious. Ray Winstone's mercenary character feels totally out of place and his character seems to be nothing more than a plot device. Shia LeBeouf is fine as Mutt Williams, but the character is undeveloped. LeBeouf and Ford do work hard to make the interplay reasonably interesting, if not fully engaging. Even the excellent John Hurt cannot prevent the Oxley character from feeling insufficiently fleshed out, and while Hurt gives an impressive technical performance, the character feels uninteresting and does not draw you in to the story. Making up for this lack of dramatic involvement to some degree, is Cate Blanchett in an excellent turn as Russian agent Irina Spalko, whose take makes an amusing nod to Rosa Klebb in From Russia With Love. Her character is fun and amusing in a subtle fashion, but unfortunately she does not share enough screen time with Ford to really develop a strong on-screen relationship. The film evolves into a giant chase film. Spielberg works in his trademark visual gags and his set pieces, overseen by stunt co-ordinator Dan Bradley. They are still very impressive, though the balance does seem to have shifted towards digitally created action sequences, rather than the more practical approaches seen in the previous films. For the most part, they work pretty well and lead to some amusing and exciting moments. Unfortunately the film's climax, while technically impressive, feels too derivative to Raiders to be original, and is a mesh of that film with Close Encounters and Spielberg's mini- series Taken.Credit is due to the good sound work though, led by Lucas veteran Ben Burtt. There are some impressive visual effects by ILM, led by supervisor Pablo Helman, ably supported by excellent model work by Kerner Optical and animatronics by the Stan Winston Studios. Michael Kahn's editing is solid, as it Jamusz Kaminski's photography, albeit both these artist's work seems more restrained and understated compared with the previous films. The film's feel good epilogue and coda is totally unnecessary and far too obvious. I felt that this bit could have played a more obvious homage to Raiders with, for example the US government agreeing to exonerate the Indy, Mutt , Oxley, and Marion characters in exchange for keeping quiet about what they had witnessed. This could have led to scene in the same venue in Washington as in Raiders, possibly even using same locations in the capital. The film then could have cut back to Area 51 where we see it being cleared up, including fixing the box with the Ark of the Covenant.In summary, an entertaining and enjoyable film with a fun plot. However, it doesn't reach the heights of Raiders and the Last Crusade primarily due to characterisations that are not fully developed and realised, therefore making the viewer feel far less involved in the story or character's plight .",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
411,RichardKleiner,I may feel tempted to say this is the best Indy movie in the series.,10,26 May 2008,"I can't believe this movie is receiving negative reviews from alleged ""fans"" of the series. I wasn't a devoted fan, and I was left amazed from watching this big adventure flick!After almost twenty years since ""The Last Cruzade"" was released, expectation for a next Indiana Jones movie grew bigger, and in a similar move done lately with several known trilogies (Lethal Weapon, Die Hard or Rocky, though the later were five movies), Steven Spielberg and George Lucas set to produce a new entry.First of all, I don't know why people exaggerate a bad review by saying there isn't a plot in a movie. If it's a movie, as thin or cheap as it is, it will always have a plot. And the plot to this one follows the same model than the previous three. An ancient relic that becomes a plot device, Indy is given the task to search for it and eventually finds it, meanwhile beating bad guys to the item in question.Long story short (BIG SPOILER) the Crystal Skull in the title is the missing head of one of thirteen alien skeletons that have landed on the famed city of ""El Dorado"", and taught the Mayans how to build, read, count, all the usual stuff aliens teach to prehispanic people.So, Steven Spielberg uses aliens again. While I considered this tasteless, if you see Indy's history, it was a matter of time before he would be dealing with aliens. As over the top as it sounds, everything fits and becomes believable within the film's universe.The script was written for dummies. If you don't figure out stuff at the very beginning, the movie will repeat the stuff you didn't get, and if you haven't made connections with clues presented, the characters will make them for you.I'm not saying I didn't like the script. It has lots of nods to the first three movies, and still can be understood if you haven't seen any of them. The funny dialogs were well placed. When Shia LeBeouf curses, you can see he wanted to do that and forced the writer to include it, as he wanted to shake the whole ""Disney Actor"" persona.(SPOILER) Something that was useless were Mac's constant double-crossing (or should I say triple-crossing), as eventually he is one of the bad guys after all and just was there to take the soviets on their tail.The performances were good, as they are obligated to be. But still, the chemistry between actors was great.John Williams' score, part of a long list of immortal music composed by him, makes a star appearance here. The Raiders March (Indy's theme), welcomes our hero and, just as he, does the work excellently. The horror big brass moments combined with the love theme make it a score worth remembering, though a little similar to the previous three.The action sequences were excellently crafted. I'm twenty years old, and still, I felt like a kid watching the chases and fights. The only disappointing scene was the one with the army ants, but that was because we already saw killer insects (no pun intended) in ""The Mummy"".This was one of those films that you don't want them to end. And, even better, doesn't go too over the top, in a point where they don't know how to end it.The effects were alright, but not excellent. It was intelligent to use real stunts, but it would have been better if they used traditional special effects, or push the envelope a little with the UFO sequence, that wasn't bad, but could have been better made, (I mean, this is a Steven Spielberg movie, the man who made Jurassic Park).If you liked the three Indiana Jones movies before this one, you won't feel disappointed.Whoever is panning this movie should feel ashamed of him or herself. This was made for the fans. Apparently, some people had their own fan-film version of Indiana Jones, and somehow hoped the Spielberg's version would be just like theirs.Still, seen as a single film, it's a great action/adventure movie for the season.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
412,dj_xand325,A conservative review from an Indiana Jones newbie,7,26 May 2008,"I have never been a fan of the indy series, I haven't even seen the old trilogy, just didn't appeal to me. But i got an offer to go and see this one with a couple of friends and thought i may as well take it. This review may differ from other possibly bias reviews as i just got introduced into this world of Indiana Jones! Im going to differ my normal review style because my reaction to the film was extremely mixed. Ill do it in Goods and Bads.GOODS Indiana Jones has been famed for its entertaining style, intense action and edge of seat fight scenes. This lives up to the fame. The enticing action scenes were consistent throughout the film. There's everything from sword fights to grease style brawls!. My introduction to the Indiana Jones franchise was blisteringly entertaining! Cate Blanchett was as always exceptionally good. Her character was as unpleasant and stern as her distinct accent would suggest!. Her military haircut and uniform were great additions to the perfect villainess. The enemies were the soviets. A common enemy! Next, the directing was absolutely ground-breaking as always from the directorial master Steven Spielberg. His easing high angle shots were perfectly executed and some even echoed the master's work on Jurassic Park. No-one else could have directed this film with such ruthless efficiency.The sound of the film was brilliant. John Williams' lovable soundtrack was sneakily playing throughout. Williams is a fantastic composer, composing such tracks as the Schindler's List and Star Wars theme tunes. The soundtracks use was sometimes exhilarating. Other than Williams' great soundtrack, the sounds throughout the movie were spot on and managed to create grand suspense. I wouldn't be surprised if this is nominated for many technical Oscars next year! BADS Firstly,the plot of the film had the potential to be very good. The idea of a mystical crystal skull was intriguing and ominous throughout the film.The plot was completely ruined by a severe anti-climax. Furthermore,there was a shameful lack of originality from the most original director of all time!. Spielberg what have you done?. The alien ending was very underwhelming, i was extremely disappointed. Was it Spielberg's ego that drove him to echoing E.T?. I just have no idea. The image near the end of a flying saucer was so shameful. This whole race to replace the skull on the body was so intense i expected so much more.The CGI was also overused. I don't see why directors feel the need to use so much CGI. It always ends up looking like a video game. The alien at the end of the film looked like a PS3 game. The mole at the beginning was crappy. I just feel that this introduction of CGI into the world of cinema is more of a bad thing. All of the oldies had no CGI and are some of the greatest films of all time. I also assume that none of the old indy's had CGI in them and they're supposedly fantastic. I just think that directors should wise up to this ardent risk of CGI overload.The screenplay was also quite cheesy at times but I'm not going to bust the screenplay too much as this type of film doesn't demand an Oscar winning script! Harrison Ford produced an OK performance in my opinion. I felt that his performance was blunt but maybe thats just indy's character. Feel free to correct me. Shia Lebeaouf was fine i suppose. Im not a great fan of his being a transformers hater. Hes a potentially good actor but i feel his roles are clichéd and boring. He plays a rebel called Mutt. Nearly as unoriginal as transformers. I expected more from such a prolific director. Ray Winstone as George was infuriating. Maybe thats just his character but his performance got on my nerves. But I suppose George got on indy's nerves so its justified!.Lastly, the comedy was quite blunt and pathetic at times but I'm willing to overlook that as its not a comedy and i did chuckle a few times.CONCLUSION Despite my criticisms, i did enjoy the film!. The action was very entertaining and i now have incentive to go see the other three. Id recommend to anyone, a must watch despite its flaws 7.3/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
413,Blazehgehg,"Not the worst movie ever, but that's not praise",5,23 December 2015,"I don't like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it also wouldn't be fair to say that I hate it.A lot about this movie is classic Indiana Jones: Nazis are looking for mystical artifacts and Indy knows how to find them. This necessitates traveling to ancient ruins, daring escapes, and punching the bad guys. It maintains what we love about Indiana Jones, and despite his age, Harrison Ford proves he can still do the role.The problem is that when the movie feels uneven, it feels INCREDIBLY uneven. For every cool or tense scene, there's one that feels monstrously out of place. This movie makes copious usage of computer generated imagery, which is completely fine when its used correctly, but Crystal Skull doesn't use it correctly. It fills some scenes with CGI for the sake of CGI, often to cartoonish effect, and a lot of the movie has this really ugly, fake-looking ""soft focus"" effect that just makes it feel greasy. It looks gross and just a little too silly, even for a pulpy series like this.Conceptually the story is fine, but the way it's told is the real problem. I never felt satisfied by the film's exposition scenes, largely because they seemed to focus on exactly the opposite of what I wanted at any given time: it is more than willing to demystify fantasy elements with scientific explanations, but when it comes stretching actual truths and fudging legitimate science facts, it remains conspicuously silent. It drains the film of a lot of its mystery and generally makes it feel a lot dumber than it needs to. It tells you that magic probably isn't real, but a 70 year old man can survive being thrown from an atomic blast by hiding in a refrigerator. The ending in particular leaves a very sour taste in my mouth.But really, it's... fine. It's not great, but it's also not awful. As far as other Indiana Jones movies go, it's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, but if you asked me whether I'd want to watch this or Temple of Doom... well, I might just pick Crystal Skull.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
414,rorygunn,The addition of a long lost son ruins it...,6,4 July 2021,A lot of people complained about the story for this one but given what Indy has face before I think it's kind of logical that sooner or later he would face off against some kind of alien life. Things like that like religion require some kind of faith in the unseen and Indy of course is a scientist interested in only facts so him meeting aliens is the next natural step. The only thing that drags it for me is the inclusion of a long lost son played by an actor I don't care for. He looked like a dork to me trying to act all tough riding around dressed like Brando from the Wild One. I know they were trying to make the character some kind of hip rebellious youth but they just ended up making him look stupid and the casting of the part didn't help because it made the character look like Howdy Doody..Also the reunion with Marion wasn't all that great either. All they did was fight over and over again. It was not the banter it was supposed to be. The Russians were okay as the villians and it was natural given the time in history that they would be the adversary for Indy..It's not a bad movie if you edit out Marion and Howdy Doody Williams from the story..,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
415,emdoub,Wow - 191 pages of comments and counting.,4,18 June 2009,"I'll chime in, mostly to explain to the folks who loved this film, and don't understand the naysayers - in previous Indy films, once you accept the magickal premise of whatever artifact he's hunting this time, everything else makes sense and is possible - in this, the script simply insults the audience's intelligence. The metallic component of gunpowder will float toward a magnet? What metal is in gunpowder? (Anyone who does not know what gunpowder is made of should watch old Star Trek reruns...) (OTOH, ammunition of the era would have used smokeless powder, which is nitrocellulose - but still unaffected by magnetic fields - but that's not reasonably common knowledge.) The lead shot from a shotgun shell will also roll toward the same magnet. You can pour the ""metallic"" gunpowder from grenades - they apparently use it as an explosive. Russian agents, in 1957, were perfectly willing (and able) to take a US Military base by frontal assault. Once they kill the gate guards, the place is theirs, because the whole place is deserted for weapons testing nearby. A strong magnetic field will swing metal lamps far overhead, but not have any effect on the guns slung on the backs of the guys carrying the magnet. Secret military bases come equipped with rocket sleds (starting in the basement) that lead, for no apparent purpose, to an empty spot out in the desert. All of this is before the nuclear test site town, which is equipped with lead-lined refrigerators, which enable an occupant to be thrown clear of the blast radius without serious injury (though he's making a Geiger counter tick rapidly in a shower scene later, despite the lead lining). After this, events in the movie become less plausible. If you're willing to park your brain outside, you might like this - there's plenty of action and some passable gags. If you like to use your brain, you're likely to be disappointed, if not downright annoyed at the insult to what used to be good movies.This wasn't really Indiana Jones - this was X-files meets Tarzan meets Abbot and Costello meets Chariots of the Gods, with a bit of 'Secret of Monkey Island' tossed in. I honestly expected the hero to have to do battle with a kitchen sink, too.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
416,NavyOrion,ho hum,3,24 May 2008,"This was not a completely awful movie. Let's face it, Spielberg movies aren't ""Citizen Kane"", but very few are unwatchable. Unfortunately, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" comes close, especially for fans of the original Indiana Jones trilogy, which set a high standard that was unmet. The shame is that no one seems to have tried very hard.The first half-hour, prominently featured in the previews we've all seen for a year, is frankly boring. Prairie dogs and ""Rock Around the Clock"" waste the chance to set the mood, just as Kate Capshaw's ""Anything Goes"" lip-sync did for ""Temple of Doom"". Aside from being implausible to the point of silly, the first scene introduces us to Jones' partner Mac McHale (whose potential as an excellent and memorable character is completely wasted by Ray Winstone's bland acting) and the KGB leader racing Jones for the prize, Irina Spalko, played by about 1% of Cate Blanchett (the other 99% inwardly screaming ""I won an Oscar, dammit, why am I here?"") It's as if Cate took one look at her character (a clone of Edna the suit designer from ""The Incredibles"") and decided it wasn't worthy of her efforts. She's probably right.I'll skip over the next scene, which I'm sure will be much more thoroughly dissected in the ""plot holes"", ""factual mistakes"" and ""general stupidity"" section, but I must ask: why would a refrigerator be lined with lead? Indy's credibility-stretching escape is followed by the obligatory ""paranoid-government-types persecuting-the-innocent"" scene. In Hollywood, if you show government agents in a 1950s-set movie without referencing the ""Red-scare witch-hunt"", they'll take away your union card, cancel your MoveOn.org membership, and stop inviting you to the good parties. Spielberg was pushing things in not mentioning Hoover or McCarthy by name, but he tossed off a wink to his left-coast buddies by having Indy mispronounce nuclear as ""nucular"". I guess coming from the guy that replaced the agents' guns with walkie-talkies in ""E.T."" that's supposed to count as subtlety (""Oh how CLEVER you are, Steven! You really stuck it to Bush there, didn't you? Hahahahahaaaa! Babs nearly wet herself! Is there any more brie?"") Although I was somewhat dreading Shia LeBouf's addition to the film, I must admit it is with his entrance that the movie starts to get that familiar ""Indiana Jones"" feel. His brashness is reminiscent of the Indiana Jones we remember from the original movies, perhaps closer than Harrison Ford's own performance in this film.Maybe that's what this movie really lacked. In the first movies (well, ""Lost Ark"" and ""Last Crusade"" anyway) Jones was an adventurer and an intellectual, a puzzle-solver whose infectious excitement at uncovering another clue was the only thing that drove him to risk his life over and over, not because he was sure he would succeed, but because the prize was worth the risk. Not only was the puzzle-solving replaced by a simple race to the not-well-concealed destination, but his old clenched-jaw determination has been replaced by a world-weary and somewhat arrogant smirk, as if to say ""Yeah, whatever, I've done it before, so this doesn't worry me too much."" It's hard for the audience to care, because they're just not convinced Indy cares.And why should he? He's in no danger. In an incredibly bad piece of story-telling, the group drives off a cliff into a river, with no damage or injuries; OK, nice stunt, nice plot point. Then they fall over a large waterfall, with similar non-effect. Then, (wow! guess what?) they go over a second waterfall, again no problem. Somebody please ask George Lucas, who wrote the script: are we actually supposed to be excited by the THIRD waterfall? Does anyone anywhere who has ever SEEN a movie actually think at this point that there's the slightest bit of peril to Indy or his friends? Gee, George, why didn't you make it four waterfalls? Or five waterfalls? Ooh ooh, I got it, let's send them over nine waterfalls! Wow, that'll be three times as good, right? In fairness, the last waterfall does finally damage their car/boat. Good thing it landed EXACTLY WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT IT ANYWAY to walk into the lost city.I won't belabor the ""Close Encounters"" final act (Spielberg's been beating that horse for decades) which, although a CGI circus, unfortunately doesn't pack nearly enough ""gee-whiz"" to counter the ""hey-this-is-kinda-silly"" factor. The final blow-up is much weakened by being dragged out several minutes too long.Random thoughts: It's nice to see Karen Allen back as Marion, and her plastic surgery isn't nearly as bad as Burt Reynolds'. John Hurt's character (Professor Oxley) was annoying, badly written, a waste of Hurt's talents, and (worst of all) completely unnecessary. Who were the natives that kept attacking, what were they so angry about, where did they go, and why did nobody on the screen wonder these things? I liked the scene of Mac's fate much better when ""The Mummy"" did the exact same scene nine years ago. Kudos to the CGI folks for the mushroom cloud, but the prop guy who made the crystal skulls stuffed with Saran wrap really should give back his paycheck. Amazingly, this movie is even worse than ""Temple of Doom"", which was by far the weakest entry in the original trilogy. Like that film, ""Crystal Skull"" might be considered an average movie on its own, but suffers from inevitable comparisons to the others. Unfortunately, it is likely to be remembered as Indiana Jones' ""Phantom Menace"", a sad contrast that shows how much Spielberg and Lucas have slipped from their best days.I suppose if I could make a poor-to-mediocre movie and still clear a half-billion dollars, maybe I wouldn't worry too much about it either. But it's still sad.This could have been so much more.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
417,jmmustchin,Why the hate?,10,5 February 2019,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. And I admit I was one of the scoffers when I first heard about it. ""Indiana Jones and aliens don't mix!"" was my thought. Nonetheless, last night I FINALLY gave it a go. And was quite pleasantly surprised.The film is set in 1957, 19 years after Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy has been captured by the Soviets and forced to help them find a crate in Area 51 containing alien remains from the Roswell crash. He manages to escape, and is subsequently informed by the military that the Colonel who had kidnapped him was obsessed with the psychic. Indy is subsequently fired from his college due to the FBI's interest in him. A guy named Mutt Williams comes to him looking for a mutual friend named Professor Oxley, who went missing after claiming to have found a Crystal Skull linked to the legendary El Dorado. In addition, his mother's been kidnapped. Indy starts to look into it, and has to dodge Soviet agents along the way.OK, I find it hard to do the plot justice without giving away spoilers. My apologies for the poor plot summary. However, the movie's plot is extremely interesting. In fact, I think it's THE most interesting of the Jones movies. Especially to a conspiracy theorist like me (the original Indiana Jones movies were based around historical legends/facts; this one's based around conspiracy theories). It's very exciting and fun to watch, and no more unbelievable than the other Jones movies (before one condemns some unrealistic stunts: they're literally no more unbelievable than those in The Temple of Doom). The special effects were really good; the movie is visually stunning. And quite funny. Again, I can't give anything away, but it's a hoot. Like any Indy film, it's quite fun to watch. I actually find the film quite refreshing. It's definitely on par with the originals.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
418,tripperM,what were they thinking!!! ***spoilers**,2,15 October 2008,"i can't believe i'm doing this. this film sucks! i'm a BIG Lucas fan and Indy fan but, Lucas has GOT to stop making films for the hell of it. he's got enough money to retire on - please do! so many things were wrong with it that even my 13 year old was bored.first, the editing between Harrison ford and his double was bad. you could tell it wasn't ford. (and we all know but in the other movies, the editing was seamless comparatively) the stunt man would do the fall and you could see ford ""pop"" up from his mark but the flow was off. secondly, a son gets introduced and he's so nonplussed about it. what the hell? that was placed as a plot mover but all it did was confuse the viewer for a minute. third, the refrigerator scene. not even plausible with suspension of disbelief. fourth, we already have reservations about the Russians. (especially w/ the Georgia thing happening) do we really need to re-start the better dead than red routine? we already have someone to be adverse with let's not add to the list of people who hate us.finally, the straw - aliens?!?!? seriously?!?!?! ID and the -enter whatever here was always about faith and the spirit. raiders it was the ark of the covenant, the last crusade was the grail, even the Sankara stones were of religious importance in temple (which has been replaced as the worst Indy film ever)there were a bunch of ""nods"" to other Indy/Lucas/Spielberg films through out this one but even that didn't entertain me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
419,benjamin_lappin,Indiana Jones And The They Should Have Ended With The Last Crusade,4,10 June 2008,"Hollywood continues its ability to tarnish franchises by churning out in this particular instalment what is possibly the most disappointing film since Star Wars Episode I, although the one common factor between those two may have had something to do with it. Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull promised a rip roaring action epic to hark back to the earlier films and an earlier look and feel about cinema, that lent itself to a hugely entertaining experience while maintaining critical integrity, unfortunately when you strip away the bare elements that made the original trilogy so successful you're left with an ultimately hollow experience.And the link between the two films? Need I say anything more than when I saw the opening introductory title sequence and up flashed ""Story Written By George Lucas"" I felt like throwing myself on top of my lightsabre and ending the pain, but I persevered, never judge a book by its cover...or author in this case. Having the actors and indeed the mainstay of Harrison Ford all having been aged by time it forgoes the old enemy of the Nazi's for what seems a logical conclusion with a linear progression on to the Soviets and those wretched commies are up to no good as they sniff around for the lost artifact. In essence little has changed in terms of plot premise with the previous outings, Harrison is exemplary reprising the role as he does indeed walk and talk like Indy, but something does not quite settle with the viewer and as such the thing that must be most intensely scrutinised is the script.The dialogue is a typical Lucasian affair. While I handled the one off quips knowingly mocking his age in a very ""wink wink, nudge nudge"" style, and gritted my teeth through Lucas's insistence on trying to link the series with glimpses of Arks and various other in jokes, the simple fact is as George W would put it ""there's more holes"" in the plot ""than Swiss cheese"". Not only does Indiana survive a test of a nuclear device before proceeding to bathe in the warming radioactive afterglow like it's a tanning salon, but we now discover he's been a secret agent all along...*insert tumbleweed, clock chiming midnight and a wolf howling in the distance*. This could be passable but after the FBI having claimed they're keeping their eyes on him within the first fifteen minutes, not one American agent thereafter is seen, which is surprising given that 'The Reds' have been carting weaponry around Nevada for fun. The introduction of a son is bearable and in certain places brings some warmth to a cold mechanical script, but having him swing through the trees like Tarzan to end up being able to swing into a moving jeep at the most obtuse angle is nonsensical. Yes action in the previous Indy films was zany at times, but always had a grounding in reality, so due to CGIs ability to create whatever nonsense is manifesting in Lucas's mind it can be done, and it's put down as fun, as opposed to just far-fetched filth, which only suspends belief in the ""oh my god I actually bought a ticket for this film, what have I done, someone please throw me off a suspended rope bridge"" sense. The artifacts in the original trilogy based around the mythical or legendary status of earth bound religious symbols so when ""The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" finally reveals itself as a hybrid fusion of The Da Vinci Code, and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind you better have that empty popcorn bag on standby. The Crystal Skull in itself has no human relation, it's not grounded on this earth so I really couldn't care less about it and or what it does as I can never connect with the item, it means little to the viewer, while attributing thousands of years of Latin American history, El Dorado, The Mysterious Cities Of Gold, The Incas, The Mayans etc to a taller version of E.T. is just preposterous. CGI enables film makers to incorporate things they couldn't before as to make them look more convincing, but when the plot is so utterly unconvincing and nothing more than a device to show off special effects sequences, it ruins what little film remains. What has been put on reel is only Indiana Jones in name, the feel and charm of the films has dissipated but in reality is through no fault of Harrison Fords or indeed Shia LaBeouf. While Cate Blanchett pulls off a Russian accent as well as Hayden Christensen conveys emotion, which only adds to the wreckage. While I never thought I'd say it, I do hope for everyones sanity, that this is Indiana Jones' Last Crusade.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
420,slayerjmk95,Classic Indiana (Only REAL Indy Fans Know This),9,4 April 2012,"The article title says it; only REAL fans of the series know this is a classic Indy adventure and always will be. Honestly, I'm sick of hearing from people who call themselves fans of the series saying the 4th was just an awful movie. Well guess what people, Spielberg always had 5 films in mind for this series, and THIS was always the idea for the 4th. So, if that's not enough, then keep reading if you're still hating on this fantastic piece of adventure cinema.The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull revolves around Indiana Jones' retirement from the night-life of being a ""rogue archaeologist"" of sorts, but is called back into action when a boy named Mutt Williams (played by Shia LaBeouf) comes to Indy for help in finding his mother, Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen), Indy's old flame from the first film. Somehow Mutt's uncle, Harold Oxley (played by John Hurt), is at the middle of it all after he went searching for the Crystal Skull, a supposed relic of the Lost City of Akator.The movie is just as over-the-top as the older ones (mainly Temple of Doom, only because of the action moments) but still carries the fun, excitement and intensity of the older films as you see Indy when he's lost some of the people closest to him, and when he's done with the adventures until Mutt shows up. Harrison Ford is always the coolest and most incredible icon in movie history, if you ask me, only because i watched the Indy films before Star Wars when i was a kid, and not long after did he become my childhood hero. Yes, there were parts where the action was just too far out there, but the story, acting and effects kept me glued because, it kept the old feel! The sound effects were the EXACT same as the first three! I love every Indy film in the series, but the only one i give a 9/10*** is Temple of Doom, because that was TOO much. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will always be a great thrill ride and a great addition to the Indy series, but I highly anticipate the arrival of the last installment, Indy 5 (not the real title). So, for all you trolls and haters who call yourselves fans, I just want you to know; this movie was NOT the weak point of the series, as there is none; they are all their own adventure into the weirdest and most incredible discoveries. The discovery in this happens to rank among them because, what if the world did find out? It would be beyond unbelievable, as were all the other discoveries of the series. Please, by all means, look deeper; you'll never know what hidden truths you'll find until you do 10/10 Stars***",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Director Stephen Spielberg, 61, producer/writer George Lucas, 64, John Hurt, 68, and Harrison Ford, 65 3/4 have produced a mighty-fine, entertaining, fun ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Even with signs of arthritis, a ridiculous role for and a silly-caricature of a performance from Cate Blanchett (Bullwinkle's Natasha would have made a better Soviet agent), a bit overlong at over 2 hours, and other negatives notwithstanding, this is a movie to enjoy. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is sensational, and the art department has come through with eye-poppers galore.It's a good movie, not a great one - you're entertained, but won't take much away from it, and one viewing is quite enough.If you fume about increased ticket prices (from $3 to $12), consider that in the 27 years since the first ""Indiana Jones,"" the film's budget has multiplied exactly 10 times, topping off at $180 million. Not even the price of gas soared like that: ""only"" from $1.38 in 1981 to $4+ today (in San Fran).

422,roystephen-81252,"Say what you will, this is another great Indy film",10,9 February 2016,"I find the bad reviews truly ridiculous. Bashing Lucas is nothing but a fad, and it is completely unfounded, especially here. The story of Crystal Skull came out of several sketches and from the collaboration of several people. The actual script was written by David Koepp. The movie was directed by Steven Spielberg. Blame somebody else, if you need to.But you don't need to. Crystal Skull is just as good as the previous Indy movies. I'd rank it 2nd behind Raiders, maybe tied with Last Crusade. It's funny, imaginative and very rewatchable. Great entertainment.I actually found the introductory scenes to be one of the best sequences in the whole series. Spielberg and Lucas have always had a great eye for recreating the atmosphere of the '50s, and here they truly excel. And they cap it up with one of the most memorable scenes ever - 'Nuke the fridge'. What's wrong with that? I personally found that hilariously funny. (Indy is a symbol, anyway, not a real person. He can survive anything. He's the 'eye' of the 20th century. See the Young Indy Chronicles.)For me, Cate Blanchett is the best villain ever in all Indy films. A complex, fleshed-out, memorable and very funny character. (Maybe Belloq comes close from Raiders.) I liked the Indy's son angle, as well. (And Mutt trying to emulate Marlon Brando is, again, just funny as hell.) Russians and flying saucers are the epitome of the '50s, so that's a perfect setting for the plot, too.OK, the ending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Kind of vague, and could have been done better. Also, the great Janus Kaminsky, however he tried to mimic the style of the previous films, didn't entirely succeed. The colours are oversaturated and there's a general haziness to the picture. And there are so many lens flare effects, it puts JJ Abrams to shame.All in all, there's nothing wrong with Indy 4.

423,BJBatimdb,Indiana Jones and the Shamefully Old Ideas,5,6 June 2008,"Oh dear. What a dispiriting experience it is to see this movie. The problem is not Harrison Ford's age but - I suspect - George Lucas's and Steven Spielberg's. There are simply not enough fresh ideas in this movie to hold the attention. There are the usual stunts and bangs and great sets and wonderful camera-work, but those are expected and, after the first 45 minutes, there's so little we haven't seen before that it's shameful.There are the uniformed baddies, there are the interminable truck chases, there are the scary ruins, there are the ancient people guarding those ruins, there is the priceless relic.And this is just what we've seen before in the Indiana Jones trilogy.The final 40 minutes reminded me strongly of National Treasure and the 'shocking' climax was done sooner and better in the X Files movie, Fight the Future. Indeed - the whole plot here owes more than a passing nod to that show, which doesn't quite sit comfortably with the Indiana Jones persona.Of course, there are some cool moments - particularly in the first hour. The motorbike chase is fun and fresh and the scenes on the nuclear test site are well done, but after a while it's real by-the-numbers stuff.There's too much going on; characters keep telling each other what's happening (so idiots can keep up, I guess) the script is slack and humourless, the characterisations are just templates of previous Trilogy villains with different accents, 'revelations' are minor and shrug-worthy and the whole thing has the feel of the London Philharmonic putting their hearts and souls into playing Jingle Bells.If this is the first Indy movie you see, then I guess it's just fine. But the makers don't seem to give fans of the franchise credit for having any memory whatsoever of the previous movies. It would be too cynical to think they were just shafting their older fans to repackage the trilogy for a new generation. Wouldn't it? Steven Spielberg and David Koepp have range.

It is ABSOLUTE FUN! Raiders, Temple, and Crusade were all ridiculous, absurd, and preposterous which is what made the films great entertainment and pure cinema escapism. What also made the movies great was of course the greatest of all cinema icons, Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones as only Ford can. Now, he is 65 and 19 years has passed since Crusade but so has his character Prof Jones. He is no longer the student's crush, he is a worn veteran who has been through plenty. BUT HE IS STILL INDIANA JONES and we are once again taken on a roller-coaster ride of nostalgic adventures in old school matinée style but this time given a 50s flavour. Marion from Raiders returns and is as feisty as ever! And when she appears, Indy seems to have found a new lease of life and fire that makes him seem 20 years younger again. There are so many fun interactions between Indy, Shia, Winstone, and Marion. Cate Blanchet steps into the villain's shoes with deliciously evil aplomb, and sporting a ridiculous Russian accent! If you are in your mid to late thirties or even early forties, you may have grown up with the Indy adventures like I have. This movie was made for us! I hope you enjoy this ride as much as I did. It isn't the best of the series but it is up there with the rest them. Each Indy film offers something different but all of them have that core element of FUN. This won delivered in spades. There are lots of flaws in the movie but they are far outweighed by the fun it delivers. Don't expect something radical, just go see it, have fun with what it has to offer, and come on, you know you want to ride with Indy one more time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
425,Steven Reynolds,We waited 19 years for this?,5,24 May 2008,"Look up ""lost opportunity"" in the dictionary and you'll see the one-sheet for this film. It lacks every quality for which the originals were so loved: plot, energy, pace, imagination, suspense, smart dialogue, surprising humour and spine-tingling moments of religious wonder. Such a heady mixture regularly had you grinning from ear to ear. This time around you'll be sitting there in slack-jawed wonderment at the lameness of it all. What the hell happened? A dire screenplay, for one thing, which seems cobbled together from several variants. Rather than setting up a simple goal (get the ark, get the stone, get the grail) as the driver for an array of action set-pieces, it seems content just to wander around aimlessly plundering the originals for references. Don't blame David Koepp. He's a reasonable writer, but here seems to have been hired as a typist. No, this cack-handed travesty has the stink of George Lucas all over it - the man who, let's face it, spent the last decade boring us senseless with the storyless downfall of that irritating sap, Anakin Skywalker. Where's Howard Hawks-devotee Lawrence Kasdan when you need him? What happened to the version Frank Darabont wrote? Surely it wasn't worse than this. Performances are fine, but they can't salvage it. Ford is grizzled but convincing because his age is acknowledged. Shia LaBeouf adds some cheek and youthful spark. Karen Allen's sass is tempered with girlish affection and the few snatches of dialogue Marion shares with Indy are among the film's best. Cate Blanchett brings her stagecraft to a ludicrous caricature, but not even she can save the day. The screenplay forbids it. Overall, this is a tremendously disappointing film. Sure, expectations were high. But that's not unreasonable. When one of the world's best filmmakers revives one of the world's most loved series you expect he'll make an effort. None is in evidence here. This is the laziest film Spielberg has ever made.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
426,Roger_Sterling,What were you expecting?,7,30 May 2008,"Looking at the other comments on IMDb and reading through the message board posts, I must say I'm a bit surprised at people's reactions to the first Indiana Jones film in 19 years. It's unrealistic, they say.Well, has ANY Jones film EVER been realistic? A lot of people complain especially in the scenes with the nuclear bomb and the jungle chase. Yes, *****SPOILER***** surviving a nuclear explosion in a refrigerator is ridiculous. Get over it. Then, there's the jungle chase scene. Think about this: *****SPOILERS*****Crystal skulls? Aliens? Bodies being recognizable even though they've been dead over 500 years?*****END SPOILERS*****Taking all of that into consideration, the jungle scene is certainly NOT the most unbelievable part of the movie.The performances are, well, decent. Ford is typical Indy, Labeouf is believable as Jones' son. It is Blanchett, however, that truly gives the best performance of the entire movie. Just sit back, relax, suspend your disbelief and remember it's the first time Dr. Jones has been on the big screen in nearly 20 years. So enjoy it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
427,dutchs-1,Worthy Successor,9,17 July 2008,"We live in a democratic age, when Monty Python's Upper Class Twit Of the Year Competition is open to all. Thanks to cigars, expensive lattes, and blogs, anyone incapable of making a decent YouTube video can still be a pretentious 370#$$V and try to tell George Lucas and Steven Spielberg how to make movies. Just consider the criticisms of Crystal Skull: 1. Nuking the Fridge. Ancient temples with intricate, still functional traps in Lost Ark and Last Crusade, mine cars running through tunnels full of lava in Temple of Doom, jumping a gap and landing precisely on the rails again, yeah, I can totally believe that, but hiding in a fridge to ride out a nuclear blast is unbelievable? Give me a break. Actually, it's probably the most sensible thing to do. The blast wouldn't have flung the fridge that far, and if it did, he probably wouldn't have survived, but it beats hiding under a table. Although I'm still not sure who would line a fridge with lead.Somebody with a ton of technical literacy did the blast effects. They follow actual test footage with chilling accuracy. The mushroom cloud is by far the most effective I have ever seen in a movie.2. Karen Allen is old. Real people do that. Considering that not one of the Batman flicks has had the courtesy to give Adam West even a cameo, Lucas and Spielberg deserve a medal for using a real person and not trying to pass off someone younger in her place.3. They went X-files at the end. What Indiana Jones movie didn't go X-files? We had a radio to God in Lost Ark, mystical stones and a Thugee priest who can rip out hearts and still keep the victim alive in Temple of Doom, and a mystical cup that lets people live forever in Last Crusade, but only if they stay inside the sanctuary. Oh yeah, I can believe those, but inter-dimensional beings? Too much for the refined critics.Nobody who sneers at the movie has bothered to mention any of the real howlers: Francisco de Orellana did live from 1511 to 1546, as shown in the movie, but he didn't vanish. He actually made the first descent of the Amazon and died during a return expedition. I'm not really sure where you find cliffs and plunging waterfalls in the Amazon Lowlands below Iquitos. It's very unlikely that any of Pancho Villa's soldiers (in Mexico) would have spoken Quechua (spoken in Peru), though I did like the homage to a story line from Young Indiana Jones. I also liked Mutt's (Shia LeBouef's) homage to Marlon Brando when he first appears on the motorcycle. A ton of fun, and no more incredible than the other three.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
428,mistarkus,Mystique of adventure,8,28 May 2008,"The mystique of adventure is wonderful in this and the other Indiana Jones films. Once again we travel deep into the unknown, mysterious exotics, exploring for legendary, mythical artifacts. In this one, Peru was the location and its myths, legends and exotic locales were wisely alluded to such as; El Dorado, the lost city of gold, the Amazon, Nasca lines and the skeletons that come to life at night. Indy once again must prevent the forces of evil from greedily and ignorantly gaining control and reaping the powers of these objects that go beyond human power and influence. It is the same fun and interesting formula and it is more than OK to rehash it after so many years.Starting off slow there is a constant build up in excitement. The great amount of action blends nicely with the more talkative, plot driven parts. The action itself thrusts the story forward with such speed and intensity it is like a crescendo that climaxes to a feverous pitch of excitement. This well executed way of making the movie creates one of the most intensely exciting films I can remember.This is the most fantastical of the Indy's and belief needs to be suspended by the outrageousness and hokeyness. But it doesn't matter. The Indy movies are supposed to be somewhat cartoonish. It doesn't diminish from the fantasy of the greatest adventures.Harrison Ford is just as good as he was as the rugged, rough around the edges, eager for adventure, yet highly learned archaeologist/professor with a flair for cynical, black humor.Cate Blanchett was wrong for the role failing to portray the necessary sinister persona. There were a few other weaknesses such as there being a little too many vehicle fight/chase scenes that went on too long. More details about the story and the myths would have made it more interesting. However the weaknesses don't scratch the fun, fascinating adventure and extreme excitement.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
429,marimbadaddy,Indiana Jones and the X Files,7,25 May 2008,"As a huge fan of the previous three films I was very much disappointed. Though I've only seen a few of the Chornicles of Young Indy TV series, they did include some of the history and background that was introduced through that medium, though it is not necessary or relevant information to understand this film. In fact, the story lacked much mystery that we saw in the first three installments. As I recall, there was one pointer scene in Raiders, where he literally points out the general plot of the film on the blackboard. Unfortunaely this film is one very long pointer scene, as we are always fully prepared for what comes next. I suppose part of that is because the plot is much more complex that the previous films. There are more characters, and their relationships to deal with, and the mystery is much more dense, and there are far more names, historical events, and places to keep track of. It is possible however, that the production team decided to make sure the average 12 year old with Attention Deficit Disorder can keep up with it all, hence the constant preparatory for what is going to happen in the next scene.I found the usage of science fiction themes distracting, and not in the spirit of Indy. Sure, all of the previous films dealt with supernatural stuff as well, but from a religious context. Towards the end of the film, I half expected to get introduced to Fox Mulder's father, and the Cigarette Smoking Man, as we delved directly into the territory and themes from the X Files. Though I didn't like it, they did do a great job of tying in our current Sci-Fi lore, with ancient religion.The villains were not very compelling, more on the goofy side. The villains were also not as clearly defined as they had been in the first three films. Also, we didn't get the mini-adventure that we had in the first 15 or 20 minutes of the previous films.It was still fun to see Indy on another adventure, and I liked the character of Mutt Williams. Though there were some definite hints that there may be a passing of the torch to the younger adventurer, I doubt if anything will come of it. I do like that they basically tie up the series neatly, and in a satisfying manner.Definitely the least of the four Indy pictures, and not as much fun or as engaging as other films in the genre like the Mummy, or National Treasure. The film does have great special FX, music, sound, and action sequences. I thought I'd be wanting to go and see it several times this summer, but I'll just wait to rent it on DVD. I would imagine for a younger person, not as familiar with first three would probably find this a great movie, perhaps even as exciting as I found Raiders at 9 years old. All in all, still fun, and worth seeing.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
430,NutzieFagin,A well seasoned Jones but ......,8,24 May 2008,"I actually did enjoy Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the the Crystal Skull. I wondered about the age of Harrison Ford pulling off the movie but it was well directed, the script was witty and the stunts were uncommonly good. However, Cate Blanchett who played a evil Commie Russian scientist gave a over the top performance with her Natasha ""moose and squirrel"" accent. I felt the audience wanted her to get her just desserts at the end, but I don't know if it was because of her evil deeds or phony accent. Also the plot kinda smacks a little of a Scientology thesis. But enough--I's say see it if you loved adventure serials or a fan of the Indy films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
431,kuciak,An interesting and enjoyable return with interesting politics,7,28 May 2008,"At the end of the third chapter in the Indiana Jones saga, we saw him ride off into the sunset with his father, or was it sundown. Perhaps I read too much into that ending, but I saw it as the end of the saga, and that in a way it was somewhat of a depressing ending, as I saw it that despite Indy fighting the Nazi's, the sundown or sunset represented the oncoming war, where so many would die, and perhaps the coming of the atomic age, a place where Indy would really have no place. But I guess Harrison Ford is in great need of a hit, and this film is it.This time he is fighting communists from the Soviet Union. At the beginning of the film, it is interesting in that (here is a spoiler if you don't know) his friend that he has known for so many years is working for the Soviets, and he is British. His character reminded me of Kim Philby, as Indy asks his how many people died because of you. Also Indy is being charged by the FBI of some how aiding these Communists, and is under suspicion. His interrogation by FBI agents was interesting for me. I was born in 1957, when the film takes place, and my father, who was Polish was apparently asked by the FBI to inform on some of the other students he might know at UC Berkeley. He told me he refused.However, this film means to entertain, and not to preach. While it appeared to me to be kind of slow at the beginning, (I has the same problem with the first one, my least favorite of all four), it does start to pick up when the female character of the first film does return, though I don't think it is exciting because of her. It just returns to the formula which made the other three enjoyable.If I were Russian, perhaps I to would have been offended by this film as some Russian Communists are. However, bravo to the Russian Government for letting this film play in their country. I would point out to those offended people who did not want their countrymen and women to see the film that their Solaris, with its reference to Hiroshima (basically implying that the US has committed a world crime with the dropping of the A-bomb) played intact in the US with that scene while we were still enemies. The film might have been better to have taken place while Stalin was still alive, when their was certainly greater oppression in the Soviet Union.Instead of some Russians saying that Harrison Ford is a second rate actor not welcome in their country, perhaps such a film like this would open a dialogue on how we in America felt about them then, and now. Why not talk to Mr. Spielberg? (another spoiler) I did feel that it would have been a good gesture if some of the Russians had survived, perhaps somehow had helped Indy in the end. Also I do concur with some, I noticed this to, that Peruvians, and some of the tribes are really given short thrift as somehow being uncivilized and inferior people. But, I still enjoyed this film despite some of these flaws, and other apparent implausibilities. Could one really survive in that refrigerator?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
432,shiftyeyeddog,"A fun, yet flawed, movie - but easily the worst of the series",6,27 May 2008,"""Indiana Jones I always knew some day you'd come walking back through my door.""I went into this with mixed feelings. Raiders of the Lost Ark is my #1 favorite film of all time. I enjoy the Indiana Jones trilogy even more than the original Star Wars films. While I was glad to have another Indy movie, I was worried it just wouldn't work anymore. I ended up on opening night finding myself hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.Indy is definitely older. He's still full of wit and action, but he's definitely lost a bit of the spring his step and the spark in his eye. Harrison still feels like Indy, but the film doesn't always feel like an Indiana Jones film. But why? Several factors - The cinematography feels too clean and modern, and doesn't have the same look as the original three films. Plus, contrary to Spielberg's claims that they were using practical effects rather CGI as much as possible, there is still an awful lot of bluescreen work and CG elements - a sharp contrast to the style of the other films. It also doesn't help that Indy almost never uses his whip, draws his gun only once before it's taken away for the rest of the film, and more than half of the characters in this film never even call him Indy or Indiana  ""Henry,"" ""Jonesy,"" ""Gramps,"" ""Professor,"" ""Old Man,"" etc but rarely ""Indy.""But the primary reason it doesn't feel like an Indiana Jones film is the complete shift in genre. Lucas has repeatedly emphasized that while the first three films took place in the 1930's and 40's and were modeled on the serials of that time, this one is set in the 1950's, and so is modeled after the films of that time - UFO's, atomic age, sci-fi B-movies, etc. The problem is, Indiana Jones is NOT a character from those films - he is a Saturday Morning Serial character. That's like taking Flash Gordon and putting him in a western. THAT is why it didn't ""feel"" like an Indiana Jones movie... it wasn't. The passage of time was necessary, but the change of genre was quite jarring.Okay, so it feels different. But is it any good? If I were to have answered that question after my first viewing, I probably would have said no. There were fun moments  glimpses of the movie we wanted to see  but they were few and far between. It wasn't a horrible film, just a hugely disappointing one  and not just as a result of high expectations. Too many parts just didn't work: Indy surviving the atomic test by hiding in a lead-lined refrigerator (even if he survived the blast, that crashing and bouncing would have crushed every bone in his body), Mutt's Tarzan-style jaunt through the jungle, Marion's drive off the cliff onto the tree that perfectly lowers them into the river Then there's the aliens. OH, the aliens.While the very idea of an alien-based plot in an Indy movie is bizarre, I could go along with it to a point. The crystal skulls, the temple, the idea that aliens had come to Earth long ago even the discovery of the skeletons in the temple. I could MAYBE even live with the skeletons coming to life and the temple portal activating. But once we saw the aliens in (obviously CG) restored form and the actual flying saucer, it ceased being an Indiana Jones sequel and became a Close Encounters sequel. I was extremely frustrated by the bait-and-switch of a sci-fi flick masquerading as an Indiana Jones movie.I was worried this alien theme tarnished my view of the rest of the film. I had spent much of the movie thinking, ""oh frak  is this going where I think it's going?"" and as a result was unable to just sit back and enjoy the ride. So I went back for a second viewing. This time, I knew what to expect. The minute it began, I just had to accept the fact that, yes, this is gonna end with aliens and a flying saucer. I just prepared myself to ignore the sillier and more out-of-place aspects I knew were coming, and enjoy the film. Once I was able to do that, I found myself appreciating the film much more. The little things, like the fridge and Mutt's vine-swinging, didn't bother me anymore. I had re-watched the other films and realized there are plenty of silly, over-the-top things in all of them, if maybe not to the same degree.So the final verdict: It's fun, but flawed. I'd easily rank it the lowest of the four films, but I'd say there was more to it that I liked than things that I didn't. It's just a movie with an identity crisis. There are times when it feels more like a National Treasure or The Mummy movie (themselves knock-offs of Indiana Jones), complete with moments and scenes that seem copied straight out of both. In fact, most of the last ¼ of the movie feels more like a National Treasure movie than Indy. These kinds of things, as well as the entire ending, still bother me, but overall it's a satisfying popcorn flick  just not a classic like its predecessors.I blame George Lucas. Most everything that doesn't work it seems can be traced directly to him.p.s. - The Shia LaBeouf Question: I actually thought he was one of the better parts of the film, to the point where I actually found myself enjoying him more than Ford at some points. I don't know that I'd want him to carry on this particular series as the lead, but as a supporting character and as an actor he did just fine.and oh yeah, Harrison Ford loses even more respect from me for pronouncing it ""nu-CU-lar.""

434,LaurieMann,"Not a Complete Waste of Time, but...",6,24 May 2008,"Y'know how people have often observed that the even-numbered Star Trek movies are much better than the odd-numbered Star Trek movies? The reverse is true of the Indy Jones Movies. The odd-numbered movies are much, much better than the even-numbered movies.And this is an even-numbered movies.The basic problems were with the script, the direction, the over-use of set-pieces and the over-use of special effects. The casting was really pretty good, though Shia LaBeouf was rather erratic. He was awkward as the Marlon Brando-wanna-be, but picked up a little when the action moved to South America.The movie really picked up when Karen Allen returned to the story.One thing that made Indy #1 and #3 so good was that they were very witty movies. The combination of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery was terrific in Indy #3. The script didn't really allow that kind of banter between Ford and LaBeouf, so this script dragged more than it needed to.There are also many more examples than usual of bad physics in this movie. Yeah, it's action-adventure, so the laws of nature really shouldn't matter, right? If you look back over the Indy Jones movies, obeying the laws of physics is a much bigger problem in #2 and #4 than in #1 and #3. It's hard to completely suspend your disbelief when Indy...well survives multiple incidents that should have killed him.It's not a terrible movie by any means, but the script was very flat, and the special effects were well-done but completely illogical in places. I think our audience laughed out loud maybe four times during the whole movie. No one applauded when it was all over (people did applaud for Iron Man a few weeks ago, which was much more fun).I think they should have just retired the franchise after #3 so it could have gone out on a high note.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Suffice to say that Indiana Jones gets into some incredible adventures, there are explosions, fire, lots of luck, and did I mention Spielberg, Lucas and Ford?This movie is the forth installment of the Indiana Jones franchise. This is on the list of must see. We have George Lucas helping out with the story, Steven Spielberg directing and Harrison Ford acting his elderly heart out. There lies the best and worst thing of the film. It is hard to believe Ford can still keep up with his on screen persona, but that's what watching the movies is all about suspending that belief. Even though Ford has joined the AARP the action in this movie is arguably as tense and thrilling as the first three films. As much of a legend as George Lucas is it's tough to say whether they should have let him near the script. There's nothing stranger than real life but seeing it played out on the screen sometimes the filmmaker can go too far. This time they went too far.

437,MyOpinionIsFact,Quick thoughts on movie. Contains spoilers.,5,23 May 2008,"I thought it was okay but it was missing that magical charm that made the Indiana Jones movies so popular. It doesn't take away from the previous movies but it doesn't add too much either. The last scene is kind of nice as an endcap to the whole series. I don't expect more movies to be made after this.Let's talk about the bad first. My first complaint was that the actions sequences were too over the top. Most notably was the swinging from the vines scene by Mutt. In fact there were many touches of over-the-top CGI... the nuclear blast scene was cool but then they went and overindulged by having the fridge fly a mile through the air. Would have been much better with a more restrained view. Indy could have gotten in a fridge in the basement and then we are shown a shot of the house gone after the blast but the Indy crawls out of the rubble. Realism goes a long way even in a movie with supernatural elements like Indiana Jones.Over all the acting by the whole cast was passable but nothing great. Kate Blanchett I thought gave a uneven performance. First her Russian accent wasn't very authentic. They really should have found a real Russian fem-fatal to play the part. Her acting was noticeably poorer in the CGI heavy scenes while strong in the rest. LaBeouf and Ford did well together but lacked the magic chemistry that Ford and Connery had. Karen Allen gave the least convincing performance and her character's emotions always seemed out-of-touch with the situations she finds herself in but I was glad she was back nonetheless.The story this time was a real brave choice was Spielberg and crew. It could have easily ruined the feel that the trilogy produced. I thought the script would have been better if it saved the more bizarre aspects regarding the aliens until later in the film. They could have then had a big reveal to catch the audience (and Indy and friends) completely by surprise. My favorite sequence in the whole movie was the opening one. It had mystery and suspense. I think we are feed too many bread crumbs long the way to have that same feeling in the final action scene.Overall Indy 4 is a fun movie but I found myself not thinking about it much after I saw it. Even Ironman left me excited for a couple days. Indy 4 is missing ingredients that would have made it great. Indy 4 feels diluted by the influence of more recent adventure films like the Mummy. Indiana Jones movies are dusty, dirty, and gritty. Models and live action provide that dusty feel but CGI does not.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I knew something must have been up when Sean Connery wouldn't even sign on to do a one day cameo and Steven Spielberg offered to fly to his home to do the shoot... Mr. Connery had enough sense to stay out after his one turn as Indy's father! This was a weak, and strange way to have Indy go... I'll not bore you with all of the details, but suffice it to say that Spielberg just can't let go of his alien thing and I just can't figure out why! Harrison Ford is great and Cate Blanchett is unrecognizable as the femme fatal. Karen Allen returning was a cool full circle moment and only a blind man from the Swiss Alps couldn't see the way Spielberg was going with the Shia LeBouf character being Indy's long lost son...

Although I miss the Nazis, times change and Cate Blanchet as Irina Spalko performed well.If there are any drawbacks to the movie, I could say the formula of the movie is the same as to all past Indiana Jones movies and there are parts of the movie I was able to figure out quickly, I was thinking who cares? Normally, this could be a turnoff, but the way Spielberg and Lucas carry it off, it doesn't matter to me. Although, if the movie's formula is tinkered with, I'm a little fearful that it could affect the movie's quality in a big way, so I guess you can say, why mess with a good thing. And of course, who could forget the humor? Many funny scenes in the movie. My personal favorite when ""Indy"" and Marion are sinking in quicksand; ""Indy"" tells Mutt to get some rope and he hands him a snake, mistaking it for rope. We all know about ""Indy's"" phobia of snakes. Maybe you can say I'm biased because I've been an Indiana Jones since the beginning, but I believe most people will agree with me that this is one of the year's best and you have to see this in the movie theater, since this was made for the ""big screen"".",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This is a rare achievement when sequels are equally as good if not better than the previous ones. Gripping plot, Interesting characters, Fantastic Practical Effects and a bit of Spielberg magic. Thats what made Indiana Jones invincible and still wanted after decades.Kingdom of Crystal Skull was a well desired movie and yet proved to be one that should not have happened.

Indiana is not charismatic, old and slow.
Plot is very weak and cliched.
CGI overdose and nausea inducing color grading makes this a painful watch even for strong fans of the franchise. Practical effects, that made the prequels stunning are missing here.
Spielberg should ve either re casted Indiana or aimed for a better plot. Yet both these ideas would be hammered down by CGI that destroyed the film.This should not have happened.

I believe if we expect too much realism from the seemingly indestructible Indiana Jones, we will be disappointed and robbed of the enjoyment the people who made this film worked so hard to give us.

443,spencerthetracy,Just because you can doesn't mean you should,5,22 May 2008,"***SPOILERS ABOUND*** There is no doubt that this is George Lucas' baby. His fingerprints are all over this. Special effects abound so effusively as to be an advertisement for his FX ranch. I hardly believe that Spielberg had anything to do with this. Reason: There's hardly a story here. There's nothing that goes with you after you leave the theater.No doubt that Harrison Ford is in incredible shape, and it was great to see him do his stuff. It was nice to see his old flame. It was fine to discover that Shia is his love child. But if that's all there is to it, then the price of admission was fairly a wasted one.You hardly see a thread of real, pure adventure that ran through the first three, and which you'd expect to see in this one. I'm glad that they didn't try to pass Indy off as just a little older and still battling the Nazis. This time its the Cold War and Indy does battle with the Commies. The movie takes place 19 years after the last one, in 1957. We saw IJ3 19 years ago. So that works. But this is a whole different, and fairly boring animal. More sci-fi and more special effecty that one would ever expect.Spielberg was always proud that in this franchise his actors did their own stunts and that special effects were kept to a minimum. But its just not so here. They abound with so much ferocity, that one cannot help but to roll one's eyes.I liked it, but it wasn't worth the 2 decade wait. That's for sure.I expected more from 2 seasoned, imaginative directors who it seems have more paint than story rolling through their heads.

444,Medacakathareal,"Could've been better, but could've been a whole lot worse",7,25 May 2008,"After reading some disparaging reviews about this movie I went to the theater almost wanting to hate it. The movie has plenty of humor and lots of nods or references to previous films almost to the point of being a self-spoof, but not quite. Harrison Ford does alright with what feels like a first or second draft script which remains unpolished. The story itself is told in a strange order that builds almost zero suspense, but has enough humor, action, and mystery to keep you watching...Yes there are aliens, as everyone seems to point out as though it was the most terrible thing ever... The idea of Indiana Jones is that he's supposed to find artifacts with supernatural powers, what's more supernatural than aliens from another dimension? Anyway most of the actors do well however there's a lot of backstory about what Indiana did in WWII which made me wonder why Spielberg didn't have so much as a flashback prepared and why Lucas and Spielberg waited this long to do a sequel...While I enjoyed the movie a lot it doesn't come close to the original three (about as far from the mark as Phantom Menace) but on its own merit it actually isn't that bad. The one real requirement I had for the film going in was ""Will Indiana bleed?"". One of the more revolutionary things Dr. Jones did in his films was get himself bruised and bloodied and there was a little blood in this one...The last and final drawback was that Indiana Jones got married, something a bad-ass hero is not really meant to do, but I guess he is getting old and chances are Shia is being groomed to take over the fedora soon enough...Good effects + Good Humor + an OK script = A pretty good film...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
445,backseat-2,"I Set My Sights Low, And Thus Had a Pretty Good Time",7,28 May 2008,"I really did not expect much from 'Crystal Skull'. I thought, Ford's too old, Denholm Elliot is dead, the kid will be a distracting punk, and Lucas will have written the script. Well, I discovered that no, yes, no, yes, equals not too shabby.The basic formula is identical, although many others have correctly commented that there is very little character development and the bad guys hardly seem very bad - you almost want them to get what they are after. Ray Winstone's character could have been left out an nobody would have noticed or cared if they did. It was fun to see the best Indy babe back, namely Karen Allen, and Cate Blanchett looked pretty hot in her shades and suit (wait, she is supposed to be scary? someone screwed up!) The main things that really bugged me were basic sloppiness and simple goofs that went far beyond the suspension of disbelief: ******* Here be spoilers ******* - In Hanger 51 before the blast, there is a large red LED display counting down. Somebody should have told the production designers that visible-spectrum LEDs would not be invented until about 10 years after the time frame of the movie...this just looked so WRONG! - It's bad enough that George Bush can't remember to pronounce 'nuclear' correctly, but SOMEONE on the set should have noticed Harrison Ford making that same unscientist-like blunder and had him fix it in ADR.Did refrigerators in the 50's have lead linings? Even if they did for some reason, things close to atomic bomb blasts get VERY hot and it seems that Indy's fridge should have melted or something. Well, alright, some airplanes were put near A-bomb tests and survived, but they were further away from the ground-zero, and EVEN THEN the G-forces from being thrown so far and crashing to earth would have killed him.Why is it that every crappy and mentally-retarded person that has a shingle saying ""Hollywood screenwriter"" thinks that magnets attract EVERYTHING, or at least ALL METALS? And why is it that directors can so easily forger that in a scene with a super powerful magnet nearby, which can pull a man's glasses off and throw them through the air, that soldiers right next to the magnet with guns don't have any problems aiming those guns? - 90% of all high school educated Americans could tidy up a script better than George Lucas, who should be congratulated once more for coming up with the three original Stars Wars films then be forcibly retired to a desert island somewhere for the rest of his natural life.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
446,javaman-7,Popcorn was invented for movies like this,8,18 July 2008,"Java Man Reviews ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (Rated PG-13). Directed by Steven Spielberg. Written by David Koepp & George Lucas. Starring Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, Shia LeBeouf, Ray Winstone, Karen Allen, John Hurt & Jim Broadbent. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2008.OVERVIEW: It's 1957, the height of the Cold War, and we find ourselves drag racing down a Nevada road to the strains of Elvis Presley's Hound Dog. Indiana Jones (Ford) and his pal ""Mac"" McHale (Winstone) soon find themselves in legendary Hangar 51 as prisoners of the deliciously evil Irina Spalko (Blanchett), a Soviet Super Spy who is looking for the Crystal Skull of Akator. According to legend, the skull is a source of significant psychic power and will enable its possessor to dominate the world through mind control.Indy and Mac escape and return to Connecticut where Jones finds himself out of a job as a professor due to FBI suspicions that he is a communist sympathizer. Indy then meets Mutt (LeBeouf), a leather-jacketed biker who has a coded message from imprisoned Professor Oxley (Hurt), about the Crystal Skull. Mutt's mom, also being held by the Soviets, is Marion Ravenwood (Allen), Indy's love interest from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Indy, Mac and Mutt then set out for Peru, with Irina and her agents in hot pursuit. There are subterranean chambers beneath ancient pyramids, prehistoric cities made of gold, monkeys and man eating ants, and waterfalls so huge they make Niagara look like Bedford Falls on a dry day.REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs:Now, what is it that all of these characters are after again? Some sort of a glass skull? The answer is... who cares? It's what Hitchcock called a Macguffin, ""the thing the spies are after, but the audience don't care."" If you are sitting in the theater and have to ask yourself why everyone is after the Macguffin, then the filmmakers are not doing their job. Spielberg and his team are. They have kept the storytelling and action so compelling we don't really care what they are after. We only care about the characters and their predicaments.When there isn't a highly inventive chase going on, then there is plenty of sharp dialog for the audience to devour. The exchanges between Ford and Blanchett, pictured above, are especially enjoyable... two well-written characters played by two outstanding actors.Even though it's been nearly two decades since the last Indy adventure, Ford's character comes across just as viewers remember him... crafty, capable, and full of muscular charm. LeBeouf, making an entrance that recalls early Brando, is adequate, but not yet ready to don the famous fedora.Good location work in Hawaii, California and the New Mexico desert combines with great stunt work and occasional CGI to keep everything moving at top speed. Skillful camera work has its place too, as when Indy throws a handful of gunpowder into the air and the camera follows it to one of the movie's mysterious magnets.Popcorn was invented for movies like this.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
447,John_Truby,What a drag it is getting old...,5,7 January 2010,"""What a drag it is getting old."" Yes, Mick, it is. Cultural icons are supposed to be immune from old age. But actors, even action heroes like Harrison Ford, are not. And that has a ripple effect through this entire movie.Try as he might, Ford can't convincingly do the moves of Indy in his prime. And no amount of editing or movie slight of hand can hide it. So the story mechanics, and this genre has a lot of them, show through in glaring detail.Perhaps as a compensation, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has gone slapstick. A lot of the action scenes look like the Keystone Cops. As a comic book action serial, the Indiana Jones movies have always walked the fine line between serious action - where death is believable - and comic action - where the audience can come along on the joyride. But when you go too far into the comical, and particularly slapstick, you run into the problem of the later Matrix films. The first Matrix was man-on-man conflict where the fights seemed real and there was some suspense about whether the hero would win. The later Matrix films were one against a hundred, so the punches looked like cartoons and there was never any doubt of victory.Screenwriter David Koepp, a seasoned pro, tries to ""take the stink off"" the problem by admitting Indy's age up front. He also tries to make the story personal, similar to the successful strategy used in the Batman series (Batman Begins) and the James Bond series (Casino Royale). Koepp brings back Marian and introduces a young sidekick whose Brando motorcycle uniform is suddenly hip again compared to 40s Indy. But it doesn't work. Indy is the classic rogue action hero, and trying to turn him into a family man just made me cringe.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull also suffers from a major structural flaw in the script, a weak opponent. The action-fantasy-myth form has a clear divide between those films with a comical opponent - which are usually failures - and those that have a believably deadly opponent - which are usually a success. Here we have a Soviet death mistress, played by Cate Blanchett, who looks like she's straight out of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. Blanchett's voice and hair make her such a dead ringer for Natasha, I was waiting for Boris to show up and at least make the movie funny. But alas he never came.Finally Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull dies from no plot. In the Action Class, I explain why this is always a big problem in the action form. Most screenwriters don't know that action is not the same as plot, and that if not handled properly, action will kill your plot. This is especially true in James Bond-like action stories in which an unbeatable hero is challenged in a series of all-out attacks. The story becomes a series of stunts, of action set pieces, each the same beat with a different skin. In short, no plot.Not that any of this has hurt the box office. But you only have to look at the second Pirates of the Caribbean to know that the script is not the only source of a film's success, or even the major one. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull shows us once again George Lucas's ability to create a cultural icon that can grab the imagination of the world.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
448,Niv-1,Good action and performances,7,25 July 2008,"I enjoyed the movie. It was much funnier than I thought it would be. Ford, LeBeouf and Blanchett were excellent in the movie. I thought the big ant fight at the end went on too long but lots of set pieces before that were really good. The warehouse chase, the nuclear bomb test sequence, the ending scenes with the skull. I thought Fords reaction when he first sees Marion was hilarious. I really believed that. Mutt was a little weepy but a fun character. I liked the final scene where he goes to put on the hat but Indy takes it away from him and puts it on. I liked how any attempt to have the character of Mutt take over for Indy symbolically was left in the dust. B+",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
449,claudemercure,predictably disappointing,7,4 June 2008,"I remember first hearing rumours about a new Indiana Jones movie a few years ago and wondering what the point was. I felt they had already managed to squeeze two good movies out of it (Temple of Doom sucks), and that there wasn't anything left to milk.Now, the filmmakers have proved me right. To watch Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Interminable Title is to constantly be reminded that there is no reason for it to exist. Millionaires Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford can't possibly have done it for the money, so I assume they were hoping to recreate the spirit of fun of the first movie. And that's the main problem with this film (and with many sequels): if you try to copy an original movie, you're sure to lose something in the process. Indeed, Indiana Jones and the Case of Acute Sequelitis suffers from that ""not so fresh"" feeling. As a result, there is no suspense. The third film in the series compensated for its sequelness by having a witty script and juicy father-son dynamics (it helped that Sean Connery was perfectly cast as Indy's father). But the script here is sorely lacking in wit. Ford is game, as are Cate Blanchett (cast as the villain) and the still-radiant Karen Allen (returning from the first movie). But none of them are given anything of interest to do. The story is uninvolving, and the plotting muddy.To its credit, the film is never boring, and contains one moment and one scene worthy of the first film. Best moment: the magnetized lamps in the warehouse tilting in unison. Best scene: those creepy red ants.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The pace and activity on the screen is so engaging that you hardly get time to think about the actual possibility of those events.Full marks to the animation team of the film.

In his fourth adventure Indy is off to Peru to locate a Mayan crystal skull before some psychic scientist soviets can get their hands on it..... and it's all down hill from that iffy storyline.It is a sad, sad day when internet gossip and speculation about a much anticipated and, by all means highly secretive, Spielberg/Lucas film turns out to all be pretty much right on the money. Mut Williams (Shia LaBeouf) 'wild one' Marlon Brando wannabe (or just victim of a lazy wardrobe) is indeed Indy and Marion Ravenwood's (Karen Allen) son. Mac McHale (Ray Winstone) is a double-agent for the Soviets. And no low expectations will be proved wrong regarding the quality of revisited, much beloved film franchises. The plot is too confusing, especially since the film starts right in the thick of the action, you never quite catch up. The acting, even from beloved Aussie and Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, is hammy at best - not helped by the appalling dialogue and absurd story. I feel sorriest for Shia LaBeouf  after a successful turn in Michael Bay's 'Transformers' he was generally regarded as 'the next big thing', and you can hardly blame the kid for not turning down a Spielberg/Lucas film, despite the awful script. But I am afraid that after his role as Mutt many will choose only to remember him in the biggest letdown of their movie-going experience. Is it all bad? Well, I did illicit a few chuckles (playing on Indiana's fear of snakes is always a guarantee) and I was a little impressed by a certain car chase/sword fight until it went on for too long and included a Tarzan spin-off and Wicked Witch of the West ""fly my pretty's!"" moment. Oh boy. In the end though, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which looks like it was stuffed with tin-foil), did little more than solidify my feelings that the best days of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are now far behind them. Now it seems their mission in life is to flog a dead horse and ruin the franchises that once represented their glory days. It is time for those two favorite sons of Hollywood to retire quietly before their flops eclipse their successes.

Dr Henry 'Indiana' Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford) is called back into action, by now it's the 1950's and it's the Pinko Commies that are the bad guys led by Irana Spalko (Kate Blanchett) who are on the trail to uncover the secrets behind mysterious artifacts known as the 'Crystal Skulls' which legend says if brought back to their original place they give the holder all power and knowledge..

454,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008),6,5 September 2019,"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008) is currently (2019) the fourth and final movie in the Indiana Jones-franchise and should be treated as such. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:When a franchise is brought back to live after more than 20 years, the question whether one should be bothered with the sequel is legitimate. Often, the answer is no. Sometimes, the answer is yes. Here, the answer depends on you.The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't quite at the same level as its older siblings. Its quality, logic and consistency vary between sound and cringe-worthy. Its overarching theme is not without controversy, and some supporting characters can feel one-dimensional. Still, despite its hiccups and shortcomings, it works fairly fine.What this movie succeeds in doing (which so many similar movies don't) is that it connects itself to previous entries. For example, there are advantages to be made from remembering characters and the ending from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Because of things like this, it doesn't feel detached but provides a satisfying conclusion to the franchise in a very family-friendly - and cinematographically gorgeous - manner. It still features violence and some gruesome scenes, but drastically less compared to its predecessors. If you are picky with movies however, its downsides will stick out and be quite apparent.Ultimately, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will appeal to fans of the series, but on its own, it is certainly less impactful.My personal grade: an acceptable 6/10.

455,elipsenbarnick,Not Nearly as Bad as Everyone Says!,6,24 September 2019,"The nostalgia was there. There were quite a few times where I legitimately laughed out loud at the jokes, but there are also times where I checked the time and wanted to be watching Indian take action rather than sit around talking about old times. The CGI has not aged well and will only look worse with time, but the heart of this film is what matters and you can tell this film has heart.The alien making a dumb face at the end was stupid. Introducing Shia's characters as a bad boy was stupid. The overuse of CGI animals was stupid (I am talking to you gophers). The amount of times Indiana referred to old times that he had done ""such and such"" was dumb. But there were so many good parts sprinkled throughout. I would have to say that I enjoyed this more than Temple of Doom simply because the jokes weren't so childish. After watching the series for the first time in years, I will rate the movies in this order-1. Raiders of the Lost Ark
2. The Last Crusade
3.The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

456,Merklin,Indiana Jones is back!,9,8 July 2008,"Its been 19 long years since the last Indiana Jones movie and the 3 main creative forces behind the films have changed quite a bit over that time gap. George Lucas has gone all experimental with digital technology, Steven Spielberg has nothing left to prove as a filmmaker and Harrison ford isn't as young as he used to be. So the question must be asked- was it worth bringing out another Indiana Jones movie in this day and age ? ""Heck yes"" is the answer to that one.Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull is the kind of action packed, hilarious and thrilling fun we've come to expect from everyones favourite archaeologist. Though its set in a different era (the 50s!!!!) complete with a different menace (russian Communists!!!) and a different magufin (skull!!! a crystal one!!!!), the order of the day is the same as the other movies- Indiana and co travelling the globe and zooming from one exciting action sequence to the next. An attack from killer ants, a jeep based fight through the jungle and a motorcycle chase are just some of the speilbergesque thrills and spills on display here, all of which are applause worthy spectacles .Its not perfect- crystal skull is a lot campier and more over the top than the previous films and there are many moments that will raise the eyebrow of more critical viewers (including some very CGI heavy scenes ), but on the whole, its hard to really lay into a film like this for implausability. I mean come on man, its Indiana Jones! What were you honestly expecting? Realism? If so you've come to the wrong place- crystal skull (much like the pulpy adventure serials its based on) is all about escapism and on this level, it delivers.While its not as good as the other films, Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull is still humorous, whip cracking,thrilling fun that serves as a reminder as to why we love Indiana Jones so much.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
457,sharkattack1978,"hello again Dr Jones, Boy have we missed you!",8,30 May 2008,"Finally after 20 years since the last Crusade, Indy is back for a brand new adventure, but has it been worth the wait? Answer: Of course it bloody has, this is Indy we are talking about. This time Indy is on a brand new adventure that is literally out of this world. Like Rambo, Indy returns with gusto. The fun from all the other movies is here. I really enjoyed Indy 4 and I hope that Spielberg does make another one because in this one Harrison still proves that he is Indy. All the expected stunts, chases and fist fights that we have known to love are all included in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That aside the plot gets a little hard to get used to. Well let's just say you have to keep an open mind about it. It's nothing like anything Indiana has searched for before, this time it isn't a religious artifact but more power of knowledge to things that we can't believe or don't understand. I went to Indy 4 with no expectations and I got what I wanted, an action packed fun thrill-ride which was what I did expect. The ending is left open and gave a nod to someone else taking over Indy's reigns but I think while he has breath in him that Harrison will do another Indy movie. The welcome return of Karen Allen as Marion was fun to see as she proved that she hadn't lost her edge since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although in this film she was kind of reckless in her methods. Shia La Beouf does a good job as Mutt, a reckless teenage greaser who has echoes of what Indy was like when he was younger. He proves that he can hold his own in fights, however he is a wimp when I comes to bugs and there are a lot in this movie. Hey what would an Indy film be without bugs, snakes, or spiders? That's half the thrill of Indiana movies the creepy skin crawling factor that Raiders and Temple of Doom had and Indy 4 is no exception. Ray Winstone is great as Mac, Indy's long suffering friend that we haven't seen in any of the other movies but after a brief history from Indy you soon realise why he is there. Also Cate Blanchett is perfect for the Russian Villain Irina Spalko. She is beautiful but very deadly and she is willing to sacrifice any comrades that get in her way to her goal which of course being a villain leads to her downfall. Indy 4 has plenty of Oh whoa factors and plenty of jaw dropping moments to satisfy fans but it does leave you puzzled. Still hopefully it will still have you appetites wet for Indy 5 which I'm looking forward to and I hope it does get made. Quite simply put into words Indy 4 is an exciting action packed fun filled adventure thrill ride and worth seeing more than once.

459,headfulofghosts126,Less a story and more of a cut & paste job,5,23 May 2008,"I did not walk into this movie wanting to hate it. Far from it. Despite early reviews and rampant skepticism that seemed to plague most fanboys, I was still excited. How could I not be? Like most of you, Indiana Jones was part of the cinematic foundation of my childhood. I was humming the theme all day before I saw it. And listen, I realize we're dealing with twenty years of nostalgia. No current Indy film is going to come out and be able to compete with the memories of the others. But I'm not dealing with just memories. I just watched the first and third film a few days ago and was amazed how well they stood up, how witty they were, how incredible the action was, and how many little things I'd never noticed before. They're not just movies I liked when I was a kid. They're just well made films period.Crystal Skull starts off interestingly enough. I like how they establish the cultural climate of the 1950's. In fact, the first half of the movie is truly solid. Not perfect. But definitely on par with Last Crusade. And I could have lived with that. I wasn't expecting much more.It's basically the introduction of Marion and everything that follows that made the film take a complete nose dive for me. My complaints will sound a lot like other peoples and for that you may decide to disregard them completely. That's fine. I don't understand why we have to be so antagonistic with reviews or comments that contradict our own feelings. Or why anyone's opinion is less valid than another's.You're either going to accept the Area 51/alien angle or you're not. It's that simple. Your overall enjoyment of the movie is going to greatly depend on which camp you fall into. Me, I didn't accept it. Sorry. It's just not my taste. I realize all of the Indy movies have moments where they tread into the fantastical. I'm not upset that it wasn't plausible. How is the end of Raiders any more so? It's just not my cup of tea, that's all. Watching Cate Blanchett make faces at a terribly rendered CGI alien who then turns her into a firework is just a little hard for me to get excited about. I'm sure if I were a little kid I wouldn't have had a problem with it. But I'm not and that's the sad fact. I would have preferred something a little more subtle and ambiguous. Not a climax where Indy stands around and watches things happen rather than taking part in them. And when the giant UFO comes out of the ground the movie just lost me completely. It doesn't make Indy 4 a terrible movie. I'd never say that. It just comes down to your personal taste. For some it may be perfectly suited to the franchise. For me it just didn't feel right. Sue me.I also couldn't believe how underwhelming a lot of the special effects were. It's impossible to get caught up in the jungle car chase when it's so obvious none of the actors are in any real peril because they're in front of a green screen 80% of the time. It's not that the sword fight or Tarzan moment were too ridiculous. I have no problem with these movies going over the top. It's just that they looked so fake.No one stages an action sequence like Spielberg and for the most part they don't disappoint. The motorcycle chase, the temple warriors, and the giant ants were all great moments. But the comedy that usually goes hand in hand with all that action was missing. There were a few genuine moments of it. And a lot of attempts at it. But nothing that even comes close to the perfect balance the earlier films exhibited. CGI is killing the action genre. The sequences in the other films were twice as exciting and imaginative without the aid of computers.The most disappointing aspect of the film though is the script. How can someone as brilliant as Spielberg keep such a tight grip on someone as mediocre as David Koepp? The best moments from the script come from other people's drafts. I recognized at least 70% of the material as being borrowed. The mythology of the skull is tedious to listen to. Especially when it's essentially irrelevant. We're not there to listen to a lecture. We're there to go an adventure with Indy. The film is so talky and gets weighed down in its tendency to over explain everything. And there's zero character development. The Indy/Mutt relationship works well. Especially when it's just the two of them. But the rest of the characters (including Marion) are just set dressing. They're completely thankless roles.I know it doesn't sound like it, but I didn't hate the movie. I would be all for another Indiana Jones film. Especially if they get an original & cohesive script and not a hodge podge of other people's idea.I think it's totally okay that other people loved it. I just think it should be okay that not all of us did. Or that it means we're ""haters"" or that our nostalgia has clouded our judgment. I didn't expect another Raiders. I didn't expect perfection. Just more than this.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
460,beastwarsfan,"Welcome back, Dr. Jones! We all missed you!",10,21 May 2008,"I just got back from the European pre-premiere of ""Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""... I want to write my review right now, while the cheerful childish smile is still on my face and the theme is still echoing in my ears.To write my review, but how? I am just... speechless! George, Steven,Harrison, thank you guys! Once again - you did it!I am totally not giving out any plot details or whatever information connected with the story - I think it's a sin to spoil this experience for you. Because it's not just a movie, it's an experience. As a hardcore Indy fan I was waiting for this movie ever since there were rumors for a new sequel. The waiting, the revealing of the first teaser poster, the trailer, getting my ticket weeks before the date... But let's get to the point :) The movie's opening shot is an instant classic - the Paramount logo, usually fading to a mountain on the horizon a second before The Man With The Hat gets on the screen, this time is being minimized to a molehill and this sets right away the sense of self-parody.The first scene... Just beautiful! A nod to George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"", retro, vintage, like a post-card from the 50s. There hasn't been more entertaining and fun movie set in the 50s since Robert Zemeckis' ""Back to the Future"" and Brad Bird's ""Iron Giant"". The only disadvantage of this time period - I admit, I really miss the Nazis. I know, Indy is punching commies now, but still...The directing - the name Steven Spielber for me is more than enough to guarantee a great time in the cinema (at least). And for those of you who have been disappointed by ""War of the Worlds"" for example (I was not, but I know some of you were), for those of you who think that he has lost his touch or something - just wait and see! The camera-work - Janusz Kaminski's work is recognizable and somehow typical (which by no means is bad!), though I read on the net that he studied and tried to imitate the style of Douglas Slocombe from the previous three installments. By the way, I watched the movie for the first time in Poland, Janusz Kaminski's native country :)The special effects - is there any reason to talk about them? I'm sure you're perfectly aware of what the guys at ILM are capable of - they are simply the best. You won't see something absolutely new and groundbreaking here, though everything is masterfully animated.And the soundtrack, oh the soundtrack... And I don't mean John Williams (who is, of course, brilliant as usual), but the classic Rock'n'Roll tracks, featured in the film... OK, I told you no spoilers, but I just can't help it! The movie opens with Elvis Presley's ""Hound Dog""!And of course, the actors... I don't want to get boring with another paragraph full of superlatives. The cast is amazing. All of the actors are just perfect. Unfortunately Denholm Elliott is not among the living anymore, he died more than 15 years ago, but they didn't forget him and the movie pays tribute to his character, Dr. Marcus Brody. And if you have been disappointed by Sean Connery's rejection to return at least for a cameo appearance - they didn't forget him as well. You'll get a lot of fan service from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, I assure you! And for sure you won't miss the father and son relationship, the new generation is here in the face of Shia LaBeouf, who steps into the boots of Mutt Williams. Karen Allen IS Marion Ravenwood, and Cate Blanchett is indeed a chilling villain.But I guess you want to know about Harrison Ford's performance. ""Isn't he too old?"", ""Shouldn't he use a walking stick instead of a whip?""... Are you kidding me?! Geez, Mr.Ford is alive and kicking, and he kicks hard! Harder than ever actually.Yes, Indy is older and we know it. But what's more important - he knows it as well and he's not afraid to admit it. You've already seen the ""Damn, I Thought That Was Closer!"" moment in the trailer, and believe me this is only a vague glimpse of the humor you're in for! Honestly, this movie is packed to the top with in-jokes and one-liners. Harrison Ford even has his trademark Han Solo style ""I have a bad feeling about this"" (repeated in every episode of Star Wars).And by the way there are references to the old movies (which I'm not going to give out) and to the TV-series as well - at one of the scenes Indy tells Mutt about his encounter with Pancho Villa years ago (remember when Young Indy was in Mexico? :))The movie has everything that you loved in the previous episodes - it's action-packed, emotionally-charged, mystery-filled, thrilling and entertaining to the max! It's a wild ride I wouldn't miss for the world. And the best in it are the characters' relationships - they are so much fun and at the same time sincere and human, it makes you both laugh at and identify with the characters. They still have that spark that we all love in the old three parts.What can I say? The Adventure is back AGAIN, it has a Name and you know it!Welcome back, Dr. Jones! We all missed you!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
461,JamesMitchell451,What is the deal with the hate?,7,21 September 2013,"Now I know if anyone reads this review they are gonna tear me apart. But you know what, it is time for me to reveal my thoughts on this movie. Everyone's favorite archaeologist adventurer dusts off his hat and trusty whip for yet another globetrotting trek as Indiana Jones returns to the big screen nearly 20 years after racing for the Holy Grail alongside his father in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Harrison Ford reprises his role as the iconic, snake-loathing screen hero in a sequel that also finds Karen Allen returning to the series for the first time since 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark. Ray Winstone, John Hurt, Jim Broadbent, and Shia LaBeouf round out a cast that also features Cate Blanchett in the role of villainous Russian operative Agent Irina Spalko. Steven Spielberg calls the shots on a script penned by David Koepp (and adapted from the screen story by executive producer George Lucas). ~ (Jason Buchanan, Rovi) This movie has some problems, I will not deny that. Some of these ideas are flat out stupid, (The fridge, inter-dimensional aliens, the monkeys) those things all suck ass. And the villain's plan is never quite clear. But this is a fun as hell movie. The action scenes are really well done, the acting is good, the script for the most part is good, and the movie delivers the thrills one would expect from the franchise. Now to address the fans idiotic complaints: ""The movie is not realistic!!!"" No duh sherlock. But the other movies weren't exactly grounded in reality either, I mean: a box that makes peoples faces melt off, a grail that gives you eternal life, people, that is a stupid thing to criticize a movie for. ""There are aliens in the movie!!!"" Well that to is a bs argument, what the hell else were they gonna do? There isn't much you can do to top the holy grail! Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a fun, well made adventure/action movie that I really enjoy. Again, I fail to understand why this movie is so hated.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
462,janus-20,90% fantastic 10% good (slight spoilers),10,23 May 2008,"I would have given this a 10, but there area few niggles, the vine swinging incident chief amongst them. I wasn't sure what i thought on my first viewing so i went back for a re-appraisal. Don't allow yourself to get over excited and Don't, whatever you do, compare it constantly to the previous movies whilst watching it.Accept the new story and characters and keep an open mind. Niggles out of the way, there is a LOT to enjoy here. The opening sequence is superb, Indy standing looking at the spectre of the nuclear future was just awesome.The bad guys are good, not quite inspiring the universal hatred of the Nazis, but still good heavies. Cate Blanchett gives a good performance as Spalko, there was never any doubt that here was a really nasty piece of work. Some people seem to have argued that Ray Winstone, John Hurt and Karen Allen don't have a lot to do and there is some truth to that, but each characters contribution brings something vital to the whole i felt.Harrison Ford, as usual, ties the thing up, its like Indy has never been away and this is where i feel one of the films main strengths are. My initial reaction was that some of the action sequences were not up to the whizz, bang speed of some more recent movies. I realised that thats intentional, that the film is paced just like the other Indys and this is exactly what Spielberg and Lucas have said for the last year.There is no sense of separation between this film and the earlier ones, the look, mood, pace etc have been replicated perfectly, but without obvious effort. Its base, if you like, feels like Indy and all the new elements in this story are what makes the whole venture worthwhile and not just a re-hash. And just like the prequels, i think this is why some people are struggling with how they feel about it.I didn't care for LAST CRUSADE a great deal on my initial viewing of it, but now i love it. Don't take the ""Raiders"" yard stick with you into the theatre and you'll have a blast.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
463,milescorn,What it means to go to the movies,10,1 June 2008,"It has been at least twenty years since I have been to a movie that when the credits start to roll the audience cheers and applauds. This is what movies are made of, stands right up there with all the great films of the 20th century. Very little CGI, the ants stood out the most. It was the first time that I went to a theater in a long time and saw a good movie. To all the people that said they should have remade or recast Indiana Jones, I pity you, to the ones who told me that this movie would suck because it has been so long since there was an Indiana Jones movie and he did not belong in the 21st century, you must not like movies. It had everything that one would expect from an Indiana Jones movie, action, laughs, sci-fi, John Williams score, and those scenes that make you look away, even tho you don't want to.Go into this movie expecting only a movie, a fun movie with lots of the things that made all the other movies great.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
464,The_Defiant1,Underwhelmed,6,26 May 2008,"Although the movie tries to live up to it's predecessors, it ultimately just delivers more of the same with a side order of absurdity. As I sat bored in the theater trying to figure out what was wrong with the movie, I came up with no clearly defined reason. I just didn't care about anything they threw at me. The chase scenes were too long and stupid. The character development was too predictable. The science was too ludicrous. The villains were too much the same. The actors were too old. The special effects were not up to par. If I'd never seen an Indiana Jones movie before, I might have given this an 8 out of 10. As it is, I walked out thinking 6. I expect other will enjoy it more than I did.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
465,Strider_1978,"An embarrassing, excruciating experience.",1,16 June 2008,"It's been a while since I saw a good film on the big screen. .I guess I'll just keep waiting.Not sure where to begin. . I wanted to walk out roughly thirty minutes into the 'experience', but because my wife sat through No Country for old men with me, I bit the bullet for this.There are warning signs in films. For Prince Caspian it came early, for Pirates dead mans chest it came early. . for me, well, it came ten seconds after Cate Blanchett opens her mouth.I don't care about the plot, I don't care that there are aliens in Mayan ruins. I wanted to watch a 'fun' adventure. I'm prepared to take a lot for a popcorn film, and now I sincerely wish I had brought popcorn so I could have had my nose in the bucket for the films duration.I actually enjoyed some of the jungle sequences where Indys punk kid becomes Errol Flynn all of a sudden. Scenes giving a nod to Temple of Doom were a nice touch at least to have some action entertainment. The water falls were mildly entertaining .. but they kicked in an hour and and a half too late.I would not say that this is even a 'fun' movie. It's just an embarrassingly diabolical set of sequences where we are supposed to believe that Indy, whilst being provoked by his punk 'son' is supposed to be motivated into going on another adventure.I tried to take my brain out. . but please. . let me be entertained while I'm taking my brain out. I like silly fantasy adventures .. The Scorpian King is (for me) great entertainment.I'm not going to go on because I am still un-happy about going to a film to somehow brighten 'our' day, to feel like I could have done so much more with two hours of my life.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
466,zerogirl42,Extremely Average,3,25 May 2008,"If you have nothing better to do, this might be good for a matinée. I would certainly not pay full price to see this. Whatever you do, don't have high expectations. There will be a lot of one-liner jokes that are kind of funny to kids or teenagers.It's a struggle to think of something good or exceptional about the film. The sets were the most interesting part. There's a temple with an interesting opening mechanism, a creepy sanitarium, a model 1950s town complete with mannequins watching TV and a nuclear blast that's rather dynamic, but some parts just reminded me of Happy Days (complete with the Malt shop). Unfortunately Shia isn't The Fonz even in an ironic sense. He has a compulsion to comb his greasy hair throughout the film.The saddest part is that the actors seem to be doing their best with a script that's more like a commercial for Scientology, than a true action thriller. There's a strong history that's laid out in the film about aliens interacting with humans and creating paranormal ability. There are all these, ""I'm going to use my psychic powers on you"" scenes.The continuity in the film is extremely flawed. Some of the characters' motivations are just stupid. I'm not going to list any spoilers, but several come to mind that just make me cringe. It was extremely disruptive to watch the film and see something that makes you go, ""Wait a minute. That character wouldn't do something THAT stupid."" Just be prepared, scenes like that are forced in there to move the story along.The effects were very disappointing too. There's an insect infestation that's a tiny step above Recon 2020. The animals just a have an unreal look to them (gophers with ""Uh oh"" expressions and the like). If you like that kind of thing you might enjoy it, but it just seemed childish in this film. Not a good use of computer graphics at all.I'm not sure if the actors did their best with what they were given or if some of them have just lost their touch. If you don't like Shia, this film isn't going to change your opinion about him. I could tell he was excited to have a role in the film to the point of overacting (you could see that ""wow, I'm in this Indy film"" in his eyes), but he just didn't have the physicality needed for this role (too short, just a not leading-man look to his face). I had to control myself from laughing at Cate's accent. She attempted to sound Russian, but sounds more like Natasha of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Her English accent slips out too. Harrison Ford is good as usual, but he seemed a little tired. He didn't have the spirit of someone like Bruce Willis in the last Die Hard movie (I enjoyed Live Free or Die Hard more than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull btw).My friends were shaking their heads throughout the film in disbelief over how poorly Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was executed. One of my friend's was all exciting before the film, talking about renting the entire trilogy for us to watch. After the film all he could say was, ""this is ruined for me."" As for me, I watched the first Indiana Jones in the theater when it first came out. It was fun. The second I saw on DVD. It didn't have the spark of the first, but was watchable as a light action movie. I didn't feel compelled to see the third. I felt like I came into Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from an extremely neutral place (not a mega fan, but not completely unfamiliar with Indiana's roots). I read some of the reviews and set my expectations pretty low. Unfortunately, the film was worse than my hopes.My friends who loved the first 3 Indiana Jones movies felt like Lucas just spent 2 hours kicking them in the crotch when we watched Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Also, two scenes were recycled directly out of Spielberg's Young Sherlock Holmes.In it's defense, the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull wasn't as disappointing as Spiderman 3, but it does suffer from the bad-sequel syndrome. It's more on par with Phantom Menace without as good special effects. There were a lot of similarities to National Treasure 2 (let's find the City of Gold before the bad guys and have a family reunion in the process).There were applause after the film from a bunch of kids that were there for a birthday party (about 30 boys around 11 years old). I did have to ask a mother to have her kid put away the cellphone in the middle (he was so bored, he was playing flashing games on it).I just hope there won't be anymore Indiana Jones or Mutt Jones films. It's time for Hollywood to come up with new characters and new stories.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
467,Neenee-b,Indiana Jones - back from retirement,7,25 May 2008,"After nineteen long years the ridiculously long named Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is finally upon us. Nineteen years is a long time between films in any franchise so there was always going to be a lot of hype and excitement over this instalment of the Indy series and because of this the movie was always going to disappoint on some level.Harrison Ford, after the long break from playing the character just slipped back into the role with great ease. The man is Indiana Jones and there can be no fault with his performance.Shia LeBeouf just continues to raise his profile in Hollywood with another solid performance but there was no real surprise about revelation over who his character actually was.Ray Winstone popped up in one of cinemas most pointless characters. Mac couldn't make up his mind as to whose side he was actually on and by the time he did I really didn't care.Cate Blanchett showed up to add a bit of class to the movie but even she couldn't make a Russian accent seem anything less than clichéd and over the top.The action, when it stuck to the tried, tested and loved formula worked very well but this movie will be used to highlight in years to come that having to big a budget can be a very bad thing as some of the action was just terrible. There was a nuclear explosion right at the beginning of the movie which Indiana Jones survived - I appreciate that the time line of the movie had moved onto the Cold War but there was no need to show us a nuclear explosion just for the sake of it.The long car chase through the jungle was very good in parts but at times the action was just to unrealistic and Shia LeBeouf swinging through the trees like Tarzan was just simply awful to watch.The use of man eating ants was stolen straight from The Mummy series where it worked so much better and was only used here to have the characters run from one set piece to another whilst killing of a few Russians.The Indiana Jones movies are action adventure movies so some fantastical action is fine but not to the extremes this instalment took.The ending will disappoint every fan of the original series. I still cannot believe that this is the route that they decided to go with as it just ruined the feel of the movie entirely.There was some very good moments though - the snake scene was very funny and the ending with Harrison Ford taking Indiana's hat of young Shia LeBeouf is Hollywood's unsubtle way of telling us that Harrison Ford is not done with Indy just yet - which would be a good thing if they go back to the old ways of doing things and keep George Lucas and his flying saucers as far away as possible.I would give the movie a 7/10. It loses a point for being a sequel, which is a personal rule. It loses another point for the nuclear explosion and the final point for the ending.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal is an entertaining film but once it will over you won't help feeling disappointed and let down. Spielberg and Lucas should have done so much better but none the less I will be there on opening night to see the next one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

""Paglaccio"" in Italian and other Latin based languages.He re-invents culture of Europe, without ever reading Saint-Paul, Cervantes, or Gordon-Childe.As all Jews, before and after him all he cares is to make money.

The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Shia was wonderful. There are some great reveals in this movie, and I won't go into great detail about them. Cate Blanchett sure showed some villainy, and Ray Winstone was great, because you never knew what side he was on!It's also great to see Marian back again. Karen showed she still had some spunk left in her.In the end, this is one of the best movies of the year, and truly worth the 19 year wait!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
470,ARTaylor,Indiana Jones and the Unnecessary Sequel,7,15 June 2008,"Let me say this right off the bat, this movie has enjoyable moments but in comparison with the original three it's pretty bad. I enjoyed it as long as I didn't think about it. Once I left the theater all I could think of was what was wrong with it.It's really a shame too because Last Crusade's was such a perfect ending. We found out everything we needed to know about Indy. He saved his father, his faith, and the world. Even the ending was fantastic with the four heroes riding off into the sunset. Very rarely does a sequel manage to match or even surpass the original.This, however, was a disappointing follow-up. First of all, aliens. Really? Indiana Jones was always about mysticism and spirituality. Those mysteries of the ancient world. Those things that lie beyond our own existence. Not green men with big eyes in flying saucers. Spielberg's done enough with aliens with Close Encounters, War of the Worlds, and A.I. Indiana Jones is supposed to be fantasy, not sci-fi.There's too many characters. In the end many don't do anything. Mac betrays Indy but does little else. He's so underdeveloped that you don't care when he dies. Mutt provides humor but besides sending Indy on his adventure does little for the overall story. Oxley is literally dragged around and just takes time away from Indy.There's also so many unnecessary parts of the movie. Like the atomic blast that was a cool special effect but provided no character development nor furthered the story in any way. There was stuff they started but did nothing with. Indy lecturing Mutt on quicksand was funny and felt like they wanted to do more of Indy being a teacher in the wrong situations, but they didn't. Indy and Marion spend little time together and does no justice to the lovable bickering from Raiders. The big scene where the Feds thought that Indy may be a commie was historically relevant but went no where. Which is odd because Indy does seem to be helping the Russians. At first he tells them no then a minute later he's all ""Get me a map.""Worst of all, there's too much CGI. The backgrounds. The stunts. But it's the most noticeable with the ants. The ants just weren't creepy because we could tell they weren't real. Raiders freaked us out because that was a real cobra in front of Indy. Temple made our skin crawl because those were real bugs. Crusade made us squeamish because those were real rats. I know it would have been impossible to get millions of ants for the movie. But what about scorpions (that they had earlier in the movie), or bats, or some other creepy-crawly that could have freaked us out? The ants weren't creepy because they weren't real.And the movie doesn't really do much for the Indiana Jones character. Raiders showed Indy at his smartest. Temple showed him at his physically strongest. Crusade showed him at his wittiest (and comedic) best. Except for being a father and marrying Marion (which I didn't care for, he should be like James Bond and have a new girl in every flick) there was nothing new with Indy.This movie just lacked that ""fun"" factor that made the originals so great. It had the Indiana Jones elements but it didn't have the Indiana Jones flavor. I think it's because George and Steven grew up and aren't making the same films from twenty, thirty years ago. I read one critic say that the movie is good if you never saw an Indiana Jones feature before. That's certainly true. Maybe it'll draw in those people who haven't seen the others, all five of them.Say what you will about Temple of Doom. I personally love it as much as I do the other two. But for once there is an Indiana Jones movie that is clearly the worst.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
471,John K.-2,"If you HAVEN'T seen Indiana Jones before, watch this",7,27 May 2008,"As ever, this Indiana Jones film is full of non-stop action. Being a Spielberg film, the action is well done; being an Indiana Jones film, it's sprinkled with self-deprecating humour. If you have seen Indy before, however, you'll recognise a number of scenes from previous films ... the same events, just in a different context.As for the plot, it's got more holes in it than a colander.Go and see this if you've never seen Indy before, or if you're just going to enjoy the helter skelter ride, the scrapes and the spectacular climax.But if you're the type of person who dislikes a film if they're using the wrong type of gun for their historical era, you may find this film painful to watch.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
472,MidnightWarrior,Fun and adventure!,9,5 July 2008,"I won't rehash the plot: it is safe to say that it's been done several times already. I will say that the same fun and adventure from the previous Indiana Jones films continues with this one, albeit in a more modern fashion. And, although I found myself chuckling a couple of times during various parts of the film that weren't supposed to be funny, the overall film was surprisingly good.The cast and crew were terrific and did an amazing job. The on screen chemistry between Ford and LaBeouf was excellent - both actors are fantastic to watch.I was surprised at how Lucas and Spielberg managed to tie in aliens to the mix. Years ago, if someone had mentioned Indiana Jones encountering aliens, I probably would have laughed, called you insane and never would have thought twice about it.But when you think about Spielberg and Lucas and their amount of influence on this picture, the idea no longer seems laughable, but makes sense. I think it's safe to say that they were walking on very dangerous territory with all the fans of the franchise, but managed to successfully pull off aliens in Indy 4 while retaining the elements that make the film fun to watch.So far all the excitement, adventure, eye candy, thrill and a revisit to the past, I rate this film 9/10 stars. Excellent job cast and crew!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
473,clh-1,Entertaining and Fun,9,12 June 2008,"In the recent spate of old franchises being brought out for one more hooah before the stars get too old for another, this is probably the best. Although I enjoyed the newest installments of Die Hard and Rambo, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull delivers everything it promises. First let me tell you that the rumors are true, there are ""aliens"" in the movie. Some would call that over the top, but since Raiders dealt with the Judeo-Christian God, Temple of Doom dealt with an Indian God, and Last Crusade brought back in the Judeo-Christian God (with a heavier emphasis on Midevel Chistianity), I can't help wondering what the big deal is. The things that make the Indiana Jones series work are present and in full force. Deserving very special recognition is Harrison Ford who shows up in great shape and does many of his own stunts, since his face is clearly visible during some stunts that were probably very dangerous to pull off, my hat is off to his notorious toughness (may I never cross his path in a dark alley). If nothing else, Harrison Ford's age gives a greater credibility to the movie, because Indiana Jones has lived a hard life, and to borrow from own adage, he has a lot of mileage. Ford hits every beat with perfection, whether he is being funny, tough, serious, or romantic. Returning to the franchise is Karen Allen in the role of Marion Ravenwood, Indy's old flame. She does a great job, and looks fantastic. The fact that she seems to get in on the action more in this film than her last appearance adds to her character and makes her the kind of tough woman that we know could tame Indy. Shia LeBouff comes into the fray as Marion's (and Indy's) son, Mutt. He is a good young actor, but sometimes he overplays the 50's Greaser cliché, it's funny, but he absolutely shines when he does his action and drama sequences. The rest of the cast are good, and play their roles as if they were in an old Jungle Jim film from the early-1950's which helps to recreate the feel of the films that Indiana Jones was meant to emulate. The action sequences are great, with CGI kept to a minimum. Although there is some computer effects, one can tell that it is used only when absolutely necessary. On the whole the film pays off really well, and it's actually one of those cases where we can't help but pray for another sequel.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
474,maatmouse-1,Highly Enjoyable and a wonderful addition to the Indy Series,8,28 June 2008,"Once upon a time, George Lucas, fresh from finishing the first Star Wars film was sitting on a beach when he met Steven Spielberg who was also having a holiday fresh from making Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Between the two of them, they decided to make action-adventure films in the same style as the daring-do type of films beloved of their childhood.The results of this creative meeting was Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones (or Henry Jones Jnr as we learn he is really called), action hero and archaeologist.Three films later and with better technology available, we are now onto Indiana Jones 4 and this film.Now I sincerely believed this film would NOT happen. Two things for why it might not. Firstly, Harrison Ford is not a young man. Some twenty odd years have crept by and Harrison Ford was in his thirties/forties when Raiders was made. There are things I thought he wouldn't want to do at his age and one of them was execute the incredible stunts that are the bread and butter of the character. Luckily, Ford is a physical rather than speech and method actor. Secondly, there was the dithering around which led to the script being finally agreed.That aside, this film is highly enjoyable and certainly worthy of being considered an Indy movie and has all the elements we've come to love and enjoy. It has mystery in the form of the Crystal Skull and its connections to the Mayan people and the reason why the Russians want it in the first place. It has plenty of action and epic journeys, including an amazing and very hairy looking motorbike chase through Indy's college library and it has 2 strong female parts for Cate Blanchett as a Russian doctor/general type and Karen Allen, reprising her role as the brilliant Marion Ravenwood who is (spoiler) Mutt's mother.The plot is daft as ever. Indy and his mercenary friend Mack are dragged into helping the Russians to plunder a military warehouse (the one where the Ark of the Covenant from Raiders is kept) in search of something Indy was asked to examine in a top secret military plot. Whatever the 'thing' is, it is highly magnetised. Having managed to escape the Russians and in the process end up in a fridge (very long story), Indy is hauled in front of the FBI who accuse him of being a communist and disloyal to his native country (this is 1957 and America was in the grip of cold-war paranoia). During the interrogation process we learn that Indy was involved in the military and may have spied for America in the course of his years between helping the Americans secure the Ark and during the second world war when he uncovered the Holy Grail (Indy 3). Jones decides to quit Marshall College, his teaching college and go abroad, his heart heavy with the idea that he is no longer trusted despite his military record. In the course of leaving, Jones meets up with Mutt Williams, who is trying to trace another teacher/professor whom Indy had involvement with, that of Oxley. Oxley's specialism sounds like lost Mayan/Meso-American languages. Oxley or Ox is traced back to South America where Indy and Mutt meet up with him being enlisted by the Russians for his work with the legendary Crystal Skull, which the Russians believe can acquire them ultimate knowledge.To reveal any more of this film would seriously ruin the plot. Its huge fun, everything you expect of Indy and more and is a film to leave you with a smile coming out of the cinema. The dialogue is witty and normal for this sort of film but the action is non-stop. Ignore the critics who bang on (rather endlessly) about Ford's age. Harrison does EVERYTHING you expect of him to do in this film and a few surprises. Just enjoy!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
475,Sharkey360,The Magnificent Return of Indiana Jones,9,23 May 2008,"It's been 19 years since The Last Crusade. In The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, we see Indiana Jones on a quest that has nothing to do with religion but science and ancient civilization. The Communists are waging war against America and its allies, and like the Nazi's before them one of their leaders is interested on ancient artifacts that can help them rule the world. The race against evil begins and you've got see this movie! In my view, this new flick is indeed worth the 19 year wait. Harrison Ford is simply fantastic as Indiana Jones and even though he is older and slower, he still packs a punch and never loses his hat. The cast is great as well, especially with performances from Shia L. and Karen A. (welcome back!). Similar to Sean Connery's Henry Jones, Mutt and Marion helped show new threads of Indy's personality. Cate B. is fantastic as the villain and you'll really want to see more of her.Special effects now use CGI and for the most part they do make the film look great, although some scenes looked kinda fake. The action scenes are nicely done and I enjoyed the big chase through the jungle. Some scenes looked comical but that's alright as it goes in line with the film's humor.If there are any flaws in this film, it's the fact that the script lacked structure. There were moments when I felt lost in the story and that I forgot what the quest was about. I also miss Henry Jones Sr. very much, in fact just as much as I miss Mickey Goldmill in Rocky Balboa. Another thing, John Williams' score for this movie is not as exciting as The Last Crusade (the music that accompanied the chase with young Indy was more lively than anything in the new flick).I highly recommend this film to Indy fans, the new generation of moviegoers and fans of action and adventures. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and the rest of their team made Indiana Jones' return a magnificent experience.And you know what? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is easily one of my all-time favorite films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
476,TheUnseenMovieLover,A Fine Addition to the Indiana Jone series,8,26 May 2008,"I knew that IJ4 wouldn't be able to beat Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, I still expected it to be a good continuation of the series. I'm glad to say that my expectations were met. Not only is Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a well crafted piece of popcorn entertainment, but it has a lot of spirit and humanity. Whilst it may not be as good as any of the other films in the franchise, it is still a worthy addition.Considering the 19-year gap between The Last Crusade and this film, it is incredible to witness how well the cast and crew have gone back to the tone and look of the original trilogy. This movie fits in perfectly alongside the other Indy films. However, the best thing about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is whilst it feels like a vintage Indiana Jones adventure, it also feels unique and different to the other films.In all of the other Indiana Jones movies, the highlights have been the sensational action sequences. That is no exception here. The opening is spectacular in both its sense of nvention and execution of the gripping action, and is almost as good as the stunning opening for Raiders. There's also a great chase through the jungle which involves all of the key characters. The latter scene shows the cast and crew near the peak of their talents, and is nicely similar to the magnificent truck chase in Raiders. There are other slices of cool action, but I won't spoil them for you.All of the cast members seem to be thoroughly enjoying their roles, and give terrific performances. Returning to the role of Indiana Jones after an long absence, Harrison Ford slips into the role as if it were a well-worn glove. His wry attitude in the face of danger and habit for one-liners haven't been tarnished one little bit, and Ford shows right from the beginning that he can still move pretty well for his age. It's great to see Ford enjoying himself so much, and this is easily his best performance in years.As villainous KGB agent Irina Spalko, Cate Blanchett sinks her teeth into the role. Blanchett is deliciously hammy, making her a truly memorable villain. Even if she isn't as menacing as Raiders' Belloq, she is still entertaining enough to satisfy. As Indy's sidekick Mutt Williams, Shia LaBeouf is terrific. He brings zest, humour and heart to the role. Both he and Ford share a wonderful chemistry which is reminiscent of the relationship between Ford and Sean Connery in The Last Crusade. For those who have attacked him, this is evidence that LaBeouf is a skilled actor, not only in big-budget blockbusters (Transformers) but also in smaller films (Holes). Karen Allen returns as Indy's best love interest Marion Ravenwood, and gives a performance which is full of energy, grit and excitement. It's fantastic to see her return, and to once again strike up the brilliant chemistry between her and Ford that they had in Raiders. Jim Broadbent also makes a memorable appearance as the Marcus Brody figure of this installment. Other actors, such as John Hurt and Ray Winstone, valiantly struggle with weakly written roles. This is one of the film's most obvious flaws. The script's well written by David Koepp. Whilst Koepp doesn't write a screenplay which panders to the Indiana Jones fans, he doesn't ignore them either. He's written a script that everyone in the audience can enjoy, with moments of humour (the moment when Indy faces his phobia of snakes is pure gold), action and well-timed moments of sadness and nostalgia (the moments referring to the deceased Marcus Brody and Henry Jones Sr. are moving and human). Koepp also does a brilliant job of wrapping all of the classic Indy elements into a new and interesting story, crafting an addition which can stand out on its own in the series. The production values are excellent. The visuals are nicely done (the moment with Indy framed against a mushroom cloud has the potential to become iconic), although they can sometimes be painfully obvious (the camera looking down on a graveyard in Peru makes it easy to see that the graveyard is a model). The stunts are expertly executed, particularly in the opening sequence. The sets are just as fantastic as those from the previous films, whilst John Williams once again provides a majestic, heart-stopping and moving score.Orchestrating the whole shah-bang is Steven Spielberg. None of the other factors which play into the film's success are as important as Spielberg's excitement over the project, which is its biggest advantage. Spielberg directs with more energy then we have seen from him in a while, and it is compelling to see the 'Berg enjoying his work so much. I am grateful that Spielberg returned to direct this movie, and I'll only go to see another Indy film if Spielberg directs.The film has flaws, yes. But overall, IJ4 is a film with a superb director at his childish best, a brilliant cast, exciting action scenes, an accomplished script and a skillful technical crew combining to make one unbelievably entertaining thrill ride. Don't listen to all of the people who are whining because it isn't the next Raiders, or who are picking apart its corny moments and making a mountain out of a molehill (you'll get the pun when you see the movie). Otherwise, you'll miss a worthwhile treat.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
477,JAM-31,"As an Indy Fan, I am bound to be more critical...",6,26 May 2008,"I am a die-hard Indiana Jones fan. The originals meant so much to me as I grew up. But I wasn't expecting too much from this film. Mostly because of the hype and anticipation a movie like this brings, after 19 years of absence. Also because of Star Wars Episodes I, II, and III, which proved that George Lucas was out of touch.""Crystal Skull"" could have delivered. It had all the potential to be another great film in the series, maybe not an equal to the almost perfect films, ""Raiders,"" and ""Temple of Doom,"" but could have been a great adventure masterpiece. It has good moments, and it is enjoyable just to see Indy and Marion and the Spielberg/Lucas crew at it again. But it never achieves greatness because of three main things.First: The plot. I found it hard to understand the motives of the characters or what they were looking for throughout most of the film. The dialog that begins when Mutt Williams enters is clunky, and confusing. It reminded me of the heavily plot-related dialog from ""Phantom Menace"": weird, uninteresting and boring. We should get chills when we hear the characters talk about the magical treasures and dangers that await them. Here it never really makes sense what they are talking about. The crystal skulls of the title aren't a great macguffin, its surprising how important they were to George Lucas. I'm not crazy about the idea of Indy fighting over an alien artifact. Indiana Jones searches for lost legendary treasures and remnants of ancient civilizations. Part of our love for the character is the thought of him uncovering the sites we have always heard about, the excitement that such magic and amazing places could actually be out there in our own world, waiting to be discovered by adventurers. It's not like there's nothing left for Indy to discover, or for his villains to be after (Atlantis, the Fountain of Youth, etc). The alien plot could have worked, but Lucas failed to make the concept interesting. It's just too weird.Second: The film is missing the thrilling (and often brutal) exciting action that characterized the original films. There were no moments in this film that really shocked or scared us, no suspense scenes that kept us on edge of our seats or made us look away, or watch through our fingers. No shock or gore. Spielberg has gone a little too soft in his older years. Perhaps he is worried about the effect his (non-serious) films might have on children, but he really doesn't need to worry--most kids ten and up could handle it fine. In ""Raiders"" (which I saw and loved when I was only seven) Indy thrust a Nazi's face into the dashboard of a truck, forward and back again, eventually throwing the guy through the window and driving over him! In the originals Indy's enemies got decapitated by plane propellers and smashed into dust by rock crushers. Indy also received his share of getting beat up, and we actually did fear for him (even if we knew he would survive in the end.) Not so in this movie. I kept waiting, for instance, for Indy to throw a Russian baddie into the jaws or blades of one of the jungle vehicles, but it never happened. The villains seem to be in on the joke. They aren't evil enough. I appreciate it that Indy fought a Russian heavy in a similar fashion to the way he fought the German mechanic in ""Raiders,"" but it really just felt like a weak retread of that fight. The Russian wasn't memorable or much bigger than Indy and the fight wasn't as rough as it could have been (although the ants add a nice touch where the movie DOES grant a moment of squeamishness). I'm not crazy about the main villain being a woman. Cate Blanchett is decent as ""Irina Spalko,"" but obviously I never wanted to see Indy land a punch on her, something he did so well against his former lead villains.Third: The movie rushes through all of its best potential moments. Every action scene seems to be over as quickly as it started, a complaint I had about ""Last Crusade."" The motorcycle chase in Connecticut started off decently, but then ended abruptly. Same with the jungle chase. The bar fight in the college town could have been a great scene, but we cut away from it right after it starts. Think of all the missed opportunities--a bar fight resembling the original one in ""Raiders,"" and maybe some satire of bar-fight clichés in general. The waterfalls our heroes later go down are really just punchlines, not adventure scenes.""Crystal Skull"" is still a decent film, and in my opinion about equal to ""Last Crusade"" (I know I am in the minority in my preference for ""Doom"" over that one.) I wouldn't be so critical of it if I didn't enjoy the originals so greatly. It is worth seeing just to see Harrison Ford play Indy again. I also appreciated the inclusion of Karen Allen as Marion, and on Spielberg's effort to film the movie in a way that made it resemble the originals (and it does.) I am a 20th century history buff, and the 1950's have always been my least favorite decade--they are just so unexciting in comparison to the decades before and after. But this movie, in its setting, gave me new appreciation for the 1950's. The styles and feel of the film gave it a good atmosphere to work with. I also liked the direction Indy takes in his relationship with Marion, and the acknowledgments of his past. I could totally see him as an OSS agent in WWII. The film left me wanting to see another Indy film. Hopefully, the next one will be done with a little less Lucas, and a little more old-fashioned Spielberg. Grade: B-",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
478,anifanmc,DO NOT under any circumstances waste your money on this movie,2,10 June 2008,"I love Indiana Jones. Both the character, and the franchise. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a childhood memory for me and one which always brings me back to those days. I'm only 20 years old, and I'm saying this with complete sincerity, that I would give anything to go back to the days when Spielberg and Lucas did not tear apart my childhood memories. The fault of this almost completely falls on Lucas when it comes to IJ and the K of the Crystal Skull, but I implore Spielberg as to why he didn't find it in some part of his sanity to stop this travesty.The plot of the movie is god-awful. It was a blur, poorly explained at best with a terrible premise. Some professor gets kidnapped by Soviets (who happen to be exactly the same ones Jones has escaped from) and owns a crystal skull where he found in the middle of nowhere with absolutely no basis, and then ends up discovering that aliens from another dimension/outer space gave humans technology.Okay, first of all, this plot is far from unique. The whole PREMISE of the Stargate franchise is that aliens visited humans a long time ago in their infancy and gave them the knowledge and technology to grow. Secondly, half of the action scenes in this movie were ridiculous. The whole getting in a fridge to save yourself from a nuke thing was beyond stupid but even THAT I understood because, hey, he's Indy. But the moment I saw Shia LaBeouf swinging on vines along with monkeys to get back to his convoy, I knew the movie had gone downhill. That, and the CGI badgers, were proof that Lucas had infused his childish idiocy into the movie.One thing should have been made clear from the start. Lucas should never, ever, EVER have been involved in the plot or the dialogue for the movie. He thoroughly screwed up the Star Wars prequels by being involved with them. He has absolutely no scriptwriting or choreographic talent beyond sticking in dozens of CGI sequences so that his LucasFilm Light and Magic team can drag in even more budget money to fill his coffers. If Spielberg didn't realize that in the beginning, then he's equally the fool or he's a coward. On top of that, giving him scriptwriting privileges is cinematic suicide. He has proved time and time again that he is unable to write thoughtful, deep dialogue that is worthy of attention in cinema.The worst part about this is that Lucas acknowledges how weak he is at the whole shebang and does not seem to care at all. He's got absolutely no regrets about writing such poor dialogue for the prequel Star Wars, he even said so on record during interviews.Please do not waste your money with this movie. It will only sadden you in the end.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

480,Here_2_Review,WHAT DO ALIENS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ARCHAEOLOGY????,3,21 December 2018,"This review is a decade late, but I must say, I am at the point where I feel stupid for liking this film, at a point, I liked it over Raiders of the Lost Ark simply because this film was...newer... But things have changed, Raiders is a classic adventure masterpiece I know by heart, and the Crystal Skull is just a joke....First, the cgi.... The cgi appears almost straight out of a cheap SyFy movie.... It was bad cgi....for a big budget film..... The cgi out of the first few Pirates films is all still gorgeous and timeless compared to this, though on its own, the cgi in the Pirates films is still awesome anyway...The cast... The cast is ok, Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, well that is it for the main cast. The rest of the cast/characters are useless.... John Hurt was a great actor, but this was the wrong film for him to be in, and that is not his fault. There was no mention of Oxley in the past films anyway.... His character would have been ok for this film though, if he wasn't infected or hypnotized by a... crystal skull... by....staring at the eyes of the skull??? Why does a skull have eyeballs anyway??? Also, JUST DO NOT STARE AT A SKULL!!!! LOOK AWAY!!!!!! Why is a skull so intriguing you gotta stare at it enough to lose your....idek...... This entire concept is just stupid.....About Shia Labeouf, what is he doing in an Indiana Jones film? He is just Shia in this movie.... He is not that good of an actor anyway. He provides no kind of development to the story that I can see. He is just a whiny doofus who is embarrassed to be kin to iconic Indiana Jones. He is an embarrassment to this film. Also, Mutt provides no kind of characteristic traits that would resemble Indy.... Indy is supposed to be his biological father, but no familiar character traits...hmm.. About Mac, his character was annoying.... he kept going back and forth and back and forth with in one scene, being completely on Indy's side, the next, the Russian's, and back and forth, it made no sense. His character was no good benefit... That is it for the main good guys....aside from confusing Mac.... I won't even discuss the bad guys. They are just boring and shoot like Stormtroopers. No frightening aspect at all... Plus, Spalko has A LOT of men... Where does one person get so many people to join her side..... Spalko is also boring, btw. No iconic aspect to her at all, just the only female villain in the whole trilogy....The fights....umm.... Some of the fist fights are pathetic.... In the past films, someone's nose could have easily been broken while filming... Here, there is no feeling of gritty impact and the sound effects didn't work at all.... The hits are just as soft as patting a dog on the head... The fight in the ants scene between Indy and Spalko's right hand man is absolutely boring and awkward... It is the most obvious with being faked out completely. The fist throws are so slow and weak it is awful... Again, the impacts with punches are seriously as soft as petting a dog lightly on the head.... The fights in the iconic movies are so much better....The aliens....WHAT DO ALIENS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ARCHAEOLOGY???!!!!! Not one ounce of science fiction was planted into any of the past three films!!!!! I would not have been shocked if M. Night who made well done Signs came up with the story for this..... The past films have been about supernatural and stuff inspired by real history... aliens have nothing to do with the lore and idea of Indiana Jones.... It's just not right..... And aliens' knowledge being their treasure...still makes no sense....The best parts were Indy and Marion alone.... They got together and married at the end which is the best character development of the whole film, which is why I even rate this a 3/10... After all the years of crap Indy has been through, marriage is what would make him happy, especially at 65 years of age!I HOPE PART 5 IS BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
481,ladymoonpictures,"Uninventive, Routine and More a Money Maker Than A Crowd Pleaser",7,27 May 2008,"Kinda like a Grissom novel: It can sell millions yet still be accounted as pap! It's called 'riding on your reputation'! That's exactly what ""IJ4"" does! First off, big deal about any crystal skull. How uninventive can these Hollywood brain children be? It is a very stupid idea that they launched for this movie, even throwing in connections to the UFOs. The best part was surviving a nuclear blast in the refrigerator though! Spielberg had a chance to read ""Graven Image"" by RF Hawthorne when the novel was sent to his Hampton's post office box a good number of years ago, which of course contains the 'king kong' plot of the century for 'IJ' to resolve. What did Spielberg do? He sent it unread to Dreamworks, who sent it unread to the author, saying that they won't accept unsolicited material. What that caused was a lackluster, seen-it-all-before Indiana Jones on the screen, which got millions to go see it...just because we love our heros and even our old, 33 and third-speed Harrison Ford as Indiana. But why not give us a blockbuster plot instead of a yawner-only-out-for-the-money sequel? Someone please get word to Spielberg on his last 'IJ' movie plot which entails stopping the last of the Ten Commandments from being broken, when it is discovered, through an actual, translated copy (from Hebrew to English) of the Book of Jasher, that describes a most bizarre and horrific capability of slaying first born male children and developing the head thereof into a 'oracle-server'-like device that is capable of answering any question asked of it! See Genesis 31:19, where Rachel actually steals her father's image so that when he (Laban) returns from being gone for days sheering sheep, he won't be able to find them, through his image. (He has others and finds them anyways, by chasing them with his servants for 5-days.) The reintroduction of graven images into our modern world creates the countdown of events that foreshadow the actual, second coming of the Messiah, when an image is placed in the yet-to-be-rebuilt temple in Jerusalem, initiating world wide, cataclysmic destruction...unless Indiana is able to stop the image from desecrating the new Jerusalem temple! Imagine: ""IJ"" involved with a real, world ending scenario, 'based on a true story', now being played out, as the rest of the world unknowingly draws closer...and closer to destruction! ""Indiana Jones and The Final Commandment!"" I see some have read this and failed to agree. I say to you: C'mon! Shouldn't we expect and receive more from none other than Indiana Jones and the brilliant minds who created him, especially after waiting so long for his return?

482,martijn-56,"Entertaining comedy, no superior sequel",6,24 May 2008,"A 6 for an Indy film is not a good sign and I don't often give bad reviews.To start positively, the film has some nice effects, and pleasantly mixes the fifties era in an 80's movie style, just like Rambo 4 managed to get an 80's movie done in our time. CGI indeed does not totally dominate over real effects, but unfortunately the comedy and flashbacks to earlier sequels do.What this movie needed was real treasure hunting and a little less comedy. Why not stick to earlier plots like the Garden of Eden, at least to have something bigger than the cast and movie itself, namely the treasure of all treasures? Instead we get a vague alien versus National Treasure 2 plot that I could, at no point in the movie, take seriously.Part 1 of Indy movie at least had the Arc and the Nazi era, which was convincingly mixed with a thrilled atmosphere of treasure hunting and who gets there hands first at the gold.This movie had a lot of action, but no direction. Sorry. Nice we had the Bond girl of Indy 1 back, and Le Boeuf, or what's his name as Indy's son, and some old classic actors, but Spielberg should have taken back a little of 'remember part 1 of the 80's with fire and misty tunnels full of spiders' and instead do some more real story telling.I was constantly confused in the movie about how they got from one clue (?) to the next, as is MUCH better done in National Treasure movies, and also on the plot itself. So it was an alien civilization, which needs some skull to set their UFO free? Come on Spielberg, I wasn't born yesterday. Any civilization which can make a UFO can jump start it any time out of ANY pyramid, with or without an Indy and again, WHY did their 'knowledge' have to be bad, that is, the Prometian fire?It was fun watching, but the only hope for a good best of the 80's one is, after Rocky (which DID deliver big time) is maybe an Alien 5 with Sigourney Weaver.But I would hate to end it negatively, thanks all of you for making this movie anyway, as it was nice to see the 'Bond girl' of Indy 1 (Karen Allen) and Indy reunited in marriage the end, anyway.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
483,actionstar-89625,Weakest of the Series,6,17 January 2021,"Harrison Ford is back for his fourth go as archaeologist Indiana Jones. While that does sound cool and may get you excited for another adventurous romp it is by far the weakest in the series and to me doesn't really belong among the first three. Steven Spielberg is back to direct as well with story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson, screenplay by David Koepp.Quite a good opening reintroduces Indy, but sadly seems to run a little too long and not ending up where you want it to. We are also introduced to the Russian villain Irina Spalko played by Cate Blanchett. While I do believe Blanchett is a very good actor the character she is playing seems stereotypical, almost farcical old-school James Bond style. It just doesn't work for me very well. Set in 1957 Indy is on the hunt to find a mythical Crystal Skull with his son Mutt (Shia LeBeouf) along for the ride. LeBeouf does well in his role, but sorry to say it does sort of recreate the father/son meshing from INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE which well worked about a hundred times better. Not that the father/son story doesn't work here, because it does. It's just that while Indy is now the father figure I've been there before.It is great to have Kate Allen back as Marion Ravenwood. There are also some comedic elements that do work quite well in the film. To me though the style and how it was filmed is at times very different from the previous three. Why that is likely comes down to the CGI used for the film, which I must say really only hinders the film. There are a couple scenes including a sword fight on top of moving vehicles and Mutt swinging through the trees like George of the Jungle that almost sink this film and are loaded with CGI-goodness if that is what you are after.To me worth a look, but kind of sad that to me the amazing Indiana Jones series has been downgraded to a 1950s style B-Movie. Also starring John Hurt.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
484,georgebush,great for right viewer,10,15 June 2008,"Crystal Skull was great for the right viewer. Unfortunately, many people don't really like action adventures anymore. Soap opera obscene comedies that degrade the human race are much more in demand. Ideas of heroism and honor are now disliked by many viewers. Thus Indiana Jones is out of date because it is about heroism. It is out of date because it supports the idea that knowledge is the true treasure.Obscene films are popular now and are considered realistic while adventure is always blasted. If you are looking for obscene self hating comedy than this is not for you. This film has action and is exciting. The young adventurer does a fine job. And Ford is at his best. There is no graphic love scenes so this is fine for all ages. Unlike Iron man which had a deeply uncool love scene for youngsters. And the leads here were confident where as Iron Man is really a self hating idiot. The heroes in Indiana Jones have confidence which for some reason bothers some people. The villains are clearly villains and the story was clear cut and even surprising at sometimes. This film went the opposite direction from Rambo which was a violent but good film. Jones is not brutally violent but has lots of action. Of course all movies are based on imagination and the job of a movie is not to be a realistic documentary. Unfortunately, many in the audience were immature and did not know when to laugh so there was laughing in the wrong places. I do not think that there was that much self parody and the comedy was fairly straight forward. Everyone with me felt they got their money's worth. The only problem was a few bad apples in the crowd. There was applause and booing at he same time. The audience could have had a riot because some people loved it and others hated it. I would pick a daytime performance which has a better quieter audience. The daytime audience cheered.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
485,zurnderrick,Great comeback,7,23 August 2009,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a nice little film if you are a fan of Indy, but if you are a hard-core fan, you may be a little disappointed. In some way, it fails with plot, is overloaded with characters, and some of the scenes are nothing more then a funny gag. But, like I said, it's a nice little action film that deserves recognition.First of all, this movie takes place about 20 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, and was made 27 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark was made. So people, do not be cruel, Harrison Ford is 66 years old, and can not do all the high definition stunts and action that he used to. Also, the people who were working on this film were trying very hard to make high quality special effects that really kept up with the rest of the film. Third, refrigerators can survive atomic blasts in the Indiana Jones world, not in the real world. This is all a fantasy movie hear people. None of this is real in the real world. Get a life! And I must point out that some of the dialogue is off, but most of it was alright, and truly fit the characters. Shia Lebeauf, Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen, and John Hurt are pretty good as their characters, and really bring out the film. So in the end, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a good film, not the best, but it's a good film. I just thought that I would point out some of the things people were nit picking about and try to thin them out, but it really is a good action film and great addition to the Indiana Jones series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I really wanted to like this more. But because George Lucas was involved, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull went from a moderately enjoyable to completely ridiculous faster than Dr. Jones can anger the Nazi Party.It's been about 20 years since we last saw Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr. (Harrison Ford), and that's how much time has passed in his little movie-verse. The year is 1957, right in the middle of the Cold War, and the KGB, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blancett) has enlisted the help of Indiana to track down the famed and elusive Crystal Skull of Akator, with ties to a lost city of gold in Peru. Don't worry, Indy hasn't gone Red. He's an unwilling participant, the KGB is using him for his knowledge of ancient artifacts. After he narrowly escapes a nuclear blast test (thank you 1957 home appliance construction), Indy returns to his day job: college professor, only to find out a former colleague, Dr. Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured by the KGB, and Ox's protégé, Mutt Williams (Shia Labeouf) has come to Dr. Jones for assistance in tracking down Ox. Which leads them to Peru and the search for the Crystal Skull.I can't really get into more without revealing key plot details, but that's the long and short of it. And it's a really great premise.Indiana Jones 4 succeeded where several reboots and sequels have failed. It didn't fall into the trap of ""Hey, remember this from the original? It was funny then, so we're gonna do it 20 times in the new one."" *cough*Pirates 2*cough* It alluded to the original trilogy, in so much as it provided good bridging stories for several favourite characters, including Dr. Jones, Sr. and Marcus Brody. And there certain logical references, including a flash of the Ark of the Covenant in a secret hanger. But it never strayed into the territory of *nudge nudge wink wink*.The problem is that it is 20 years on. Harrison Ford is showing his age. The franchise is showing its age. The 80's were a different cinematic landscape than the 00's (I believe the preferred nomenclature is the Odds, or something like that). And I appreciate the throwback to both the original franchise specifically, and to the old serial genre in general.In the 80's, the films were centered the myth's surrounding the Judeo-Christian faith, and they took several liberties with it in the name of entertainment. And let me state that that was always the intended purpose of the films: to entertain. And they all, including this new one, succeeded fantastically at entertaining. But in 2008, the social climate concerning religious dogma, particularly concerning the Judeo-Christian faith, has become more of a taboo than it was 20-30 years ago. And I think that hindered the development process of the Indy 4. They had to take on a new artifact from a different era and a different culture. Maybe that strayed a bit too far out of my Indiana Jones comfort zone.But since they went with the ancient Mayans, let's focus on that. Really entertaining, and I stuck with it even through Mutt Williams swinging on vines like Tarzan. But where it jumped the shark into complete ridiculousness was the end, when it switched from Spielberg to Lucas real fast. I sat in the theater thinking ""What the hell?"" I still can't grasp my head around the ending. Oh, I understood it. I just can't believe that they did it, because it's so phenomenally stupid. And the thing of it is, is that it's not entirely stupid. Just one aspect. Had they ended the sequence a few minutes sooner, it would have been semi-OK. But no, they went for it, and it's just a severe letdown.Ford slips back into Indiana Jones like an old baseball mitt. He's dusting it off, finding his comfort zone, all the little spots that made the character his own. But there are definite signs of aging. Fortunately he doesn't come across as an old guy trying to recapture his youth. He plays the character as too old for the action, but he does it anyway, and he does it brilliantly.I can't finish this review without talking about Cate Blanchett. There are so few great villainous roles written for women, and she's the perfect actress to take it on. She's the finest of our time, and throws in the right amount of villainy, naivety and curiosity.I spoke earlier of the throwbacks to the original trilogy, and perhaps the biggest and best was saved for the third act. Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood. It brings the story full circle, rather than being a cheap attempt to bridge the films.If you liked the original trilogy, you'll be entertained by Crystal Skull. But don't expect it to be the greatest Indy film, because it isn't. As much as that pains me to write.Brodie Mann",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
487,galahad58,Just Bad,4,23 May 2008,"As an Indiana Jones fan, I was looking forward to the release of this movie. I figured nothing would be disappointing because the character was so much fun and worth watching. I was wrong. This movie is comes off like a parody of Indiana Jones. The script is absolutely awful. There is none of the humor or playfulness of the previous movies. The humor was what made Indy so real and likable. There were no relationships to talk about. In the past, Indy's relationship with Marcus Broady helped to define his character. That relationship showed his loyalty to his friends and the things that made him a person you could identify. The relationship between Indy and his father made the third movie a wonderful treat and it made up for the dark, miserable Temple of Doom. This movie lacks all the friendship, humor, and relationship that defined the Indiana Jones trilogy. The script lost the heart and soul of Indiana Jones and created a cardboard cut-out to make money. The adventure was also weak and uninspired. The Lost Ark was tremendous--the Temple of Doom was palatable--the Holy Grail was marvelous--El Dorado was lame (especially since it has been the subject of movie after movie after movie for decades). The action was way TOOO comic book oriented. Having Shia LaBeouf swinging from vines with a pack of monkeys went beyond dumb. The part where LaBeouf and the monkeys attacked the Russians went to Dumber. The entire sequence where over ten minutes were spent on ANOOOOTTTTHHHEEEERRRR long car/jeep/truck scene was overdone and ridiculous. Cate Blanchett was disgraceful as Irina Spalgo. Her performance was embarrassing compared to her previous works. What a waste of a good actress. I hope the Indiana Jones franchise hangs the fedora on a hanger and never makes another embarrassing movie like this again. Think Star Wars Episode I--same circle--destroy a good franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
488,arminhage,Not as bad as what some claim!,6,30 March 2015,"Harrison Ford was 20 years older than the third installment, he could not be made young so the whole timeline had to move to mid 50s and mid 50s was the age of UFO craze and Mccarthyism so it was no surprise that the enemies were Soviets and the object would be of extraterrestrial origin. Some say it began very cheazy, I say Indiana Jones series were cheazy from the very beginning, in 1981, special effects of Raiders of the Lost Ark was so big deal that people forgot about the cheaziness but in 2008, special effects were not as important, people were looking for more solid story and better mystery and what they found was the good old cheaziness, of course they got disappointed. I don't want to discuss how ridiculous the refrigerator scene was. What I like to mention is some serious holes in the plot that can not be filled by any logic. Story circles around a stolen Crystal Skull. Apparently the console of crystal skeleton aliens we saw at the end of movie possessed some great power. So I wonder, how the Spanish explorer managed to steal the skull in first place? That was absolutely impossible. Why Ox decided to return the Skull the the Spanish Explorer's grave? No clear answer but not a deal breaker. According to Indy, those aliens were archaeologists. What we saw was the destruction of virtually what they collected since the beginning of time. If they really wanted to collect something, they had to secure it in proper boxes, still a negative blow but no deal breaker... But the biggest hole is the impossibility of stealing a crystal skull by Spanish Explorer, even Indy couldn't do that so they based the whole thing on nothing. aged Indy, flawed plot, marriage at the end... but it was highly watchable and I reasonably enjoyed it with some reserve.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
489,luke-346,Too late. Too elaborate. Too much.,6,26 May 2008,"For a fourth time we are treated to the legendry Hollywood vehicle lauded by audiences for its entertainment and despised by critics for its American Imperialism. Yes, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull stereotypes tribal folk, unfairly represents women, clichés foreigners and has more than its fair share of anti-Soviet propaganda - ultimately it's detrimental to everyone and everything other than American men. However, given that the film is a pastiche, the film-makers clearly believe they can excuse themselves from any such imprecations, and perhaps rightly so.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is set in 1957 and has moved away from the 1930's serials it parodied in the previous three and instead concentrated on the 1950's B Movies, noted for their depiction of invaders from space and other worlds. This decision has perhaps alienated a lot of fans, but if Indy's age difference is to be accurately addressed then a move like this should be expected. In addition to this the film would not really be a pastiche to those 50's movies if it did not on some level champion the All-American hero, the only problem is that in championing the All-American hero those around him result in looking a hindrance or expedient. Most notable of which are the double crossing cockney and the bumbling English professor.Interestingly, and in accordance with its predecessors, there are many influences and homage's to 1950s cinema, the introduction of Henry Williams (Shia LaBeouf) is a direct homage to ""The Wild One"" and towards the end of the film audiences will be treated to various other influences, including ""The Day Earth Stood Still"", ""Invasion of The Body Snatchers"" and ""Forbidden Planet"". The fact the fourth installment has again chosen to do this highlights the director's and the producer's (Steven Spielberg and George Lucas) love of film.With the godfather of blockbusters at the helm the direction of 'Crystal Skull complements the fast-paced narrative like no other director could. A prime example of Spielberg's ingenuity lies with the opening few scenes; a crane shot depicts Indy being man-handled to the floor, followed by his hat rolling to his feet and then the shadow of his torso on a car, finally the camera pulls to reveal his face as a gentle whisper of the call-to-adventure theme plays  it is pure Spielberg and should please even the harshest of skeptics. After this brief introduction, and in franchise-established fashion, the film reveals our hero to be in peril and surrounded by his new enemy, Russians. Comically Indy lightens the situation with his trademark grin and humorous banter, although the dialogue here is a little on the cringe side and alludes at the possibility that maybe the actors aren't as comfortable as they'd like us believe.The films strength definitely lies with its direction and this is unsurprising given that it incorporates all the plot devices and mechanisms that have been established, created and employed by Spielberg over the decades. Examples of which range from the comical fist fights, the lovers tiff, the car chases, the dysfunctional family unit, use of score, apt camera-work and the pace of the editing. Coincidently, the most notable of the chase sequences is the one that take place in the Jungle which is perhaps the best chase sequence of the franchise, and probably one of Spielberg's best since Duel. The jungle scene does use CGI and many have disagreed with its use, but it's good, far better than the ""blue screen"" technique utilized for the rushing water chase in Temple of Doom, or the childishly animated booby traps at the end of Last Crusade, here we have special effects that finally work. The annoyance is that they are relied on too heavily and integrated into the film too much.Paramount to this latest Indiana endeavor is that it is 20 years too late. The script is by David Keopp (Spiderman, Mission Impossible, Snake Eyes, Jurassic Park, etc) and has ""financial-success"" written all over it and, no matter what the critics write, it will be. Regrettably Keopp's script pushes the boundaries of plausibility to the extreme. He has sacrificed the credibility of the films predecessors in favor of maximizing the entertainment value. This is correlated by the decision to have the Crystal Skull as the chief plot device, it is something (that unlike the previous films) Indy doesn't really understand or really have a desire to understand, alluding to its mystique would have been better but to be so upfront with its origins and by tying it in with Roswell and then multi-dimensional forces is little too far, even for Indiana Jones. Furthermore, this has all been seen before in contemporary cinema, from ""X Files: The Movie"" to ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" and ""Stargate"".Finally I feel that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull suffers due to a poor script, it is wildly entertaining but deviates from the previous three by being too elaborate and flamboyant. The direction is brilliant, the performances are great and Harrison Ford does pull it off despite the fact he is 63, furthermore Cate Blanchet as the Russian Stalin-like femme fatale is brilliant as is Ray Winstone. Some fans will appreciate the film and perhaps revel in the many jokes and in-jokes to be had, from the fading of the Paramount logo, the reappearance of the Lost Ark and the comical Back to the Future reference, others fans will not. However because we have a director that is fully aware of his audience it can only be noted that this film is aimed at children and it is that age group that will love it the most. But don't be surprised if you're in your mid-20 to 40s and you don't like it, I don't think Spielberg and Lucas were solely aiming to please you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
490,zofos,A Whip-Slash Below The 80s Trilogy,4,29 May 2008,"Indiana Jones doesn't really have much of a personality as a hero. He's only as good as the McGuffin he's after (like The Ark of the Covenant) or the company he keeps (like Sean Connery). Here, Indy is after the unsexiest McGuffin since The Sankara Stones of ""Temple of Doom""  a crystal skull (does anyone really care about crystal skulls?) and the pointless supporting characters played by Ray Winstone, John Hurt and Jim Broadbent pale in comparison to Sean Connery's mega-watt star power in the previous Indy movie.In the 80s, there was no other hero around like Indiana Jones. These days, there are imitators all over the place in the National Treasure, Mummy and Tomb Raider movies. Indy isn't special anymore.David Koepp wrote the soulless script for this new outing. He has written good movies like Carlito's Way and Spider-Man. Even his Jurassic Park script was better. Here he's just going through the motions without any passion or inspiration.Harrison Ford has lost the commanding presence he once had as Indiana Jones. His first scenes in the new movie have an uncertain tone and you find it hard to reconcile the character on screen with your memories of him.Strangely, Harrison Ford literally takes a backseat to Shia LaBeouf in many of the action scenes. Someone should remind George Lucas and Steven Spielberg that the movie is called ""Indiana Jones."" We've paid our money to see Harrison do his thing, not Shia.Karen Allen returns as Marion Ravenwood in a desperate bid to revive the romantic interplay between her and Indy, but it doesn't work. She's not given much to do and she's really just a plot device for an obvious revelation about Indy. It's a little sad to see Indy and Marion looking like slow old people instead of the spunky, hyperactive young lovers of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Their re-teaming only reminds you of what an awesome movie ""Raiders"" was and what a waste of time this one is.Cate Blanchett appears as the psychic, sword-wielding Russian villain Irina Spalko and she's a stock baddie straight out of central casting. With her jet-black Louise Brooks bob and her Bela Lugosi accent (at one stage in the film she says: ""Look at them"" I was waiting for her to follow it with ""Children of the NightWhat sweet music they make!""), Cate overdoes the role and at times she seems to look to Harrison Ford for guidance as if she can't quite believe she's in an Indiana Jones movie. Compared to Belloq and the Nazis, she's small beer (although her black hair does highlight her gorgeous blue eyes).The special effects are good, particularly the nuclear explosion and the finale but it's not enough to save a poor script. The movie constantly felt like it was about to get good, but frustratingly it never does. I was looking forward to this movie and I tried hard to like it, but the thrill has gone guys. Let it go. ""The Last Crusade"" should have been just that. Sean Connery made the right decision not to be involved in this one. It's not up to scratch and he was wise enough to spot it.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a tired, old movie with a tired, old leading man directed by a tired, old director slavishly following a tired, old formula. It fails to recapture the old magic. No more sequels, please. Leave the memories of my youth intact.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
491,piksplanet,Vintage Indy!!,8,21 June 2008,"Well, it has been 19 years since the Last Crusade, 27 years since the franchise began. They probably did not plan this far out, like what Lucas did for The Star Wars saga. Releasing the first three, then another three. This is quite easily the most awaited movie of the year so far, The Dark Knight being the next one. For all I care, I would totally stick around if they made two more Indiana Jones installments. To put things straight right at the start, I do not know why people are giving this film such a hard time. I mean, have they forgotten what Indy is all about? Have they not seen the previous three? All of which were logic defying in their own special way? No one expects logic from an Indiana Jones movie. It's supposed to be fun, full of non-stop action and adventure, and with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the magical combination of Spielberg, Lucas, and most of all, Ford, have struck gold. Real gold! The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is probably the first of a brand new series of Indiana Jones films. Having turned down a script from the amazing Frank Darabont, questions were already being asked about how David Koepp's script could out-do one by Darabont. Frank Darabont is credited with films like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, and surely Koepp's script had something in it that rose above Darabont's.The film is set in 1957, 19 years after The Last Crusade which brought the discovery of the Holy Grail. To say that the storyline of the fourth Indy movie is a surprise would be a mistake. One probably saw something like this coming. Although I wont give the whole thing away, for the record, it is bizarre, like all the previous ones. Think Area 51, which happens to be the warehouse where everything kicks off. It is also the same warehouse which we saw last in the closing credits of Raiders of The Lost Ark. Read : Ark of the Covenant being put away in a wooden crate! Unlike all the previous films, this one kicks off with opening credits without anything significant happening in the background. They do have loud version of Elvis's Hound Dog playing all the while. It does get you in the mood. And the gophers. I swear they looked like they were going to be appearing throughout the movie! Apart from that, the film looks the same as the older ones. I don't know how they did it. Even Ford looks like he just returned from his Holy Grail discovery trip with his father and started running around in search of the Crystal Skull. Its nostalgia in its highest level. Whether it is the secret passages or insects, or the fight sequences or the snakes, its all reminiscent of the old Indy.The casting is perfect. I hated that annoying little kid from The Temple of Doom. Shia Labeouf, the new kid on the block with hits like Disturbia and Transformers under his belt, plays Mutt Williams - a greaser. He repairs bikes as a profession, school dropout, combs his hair at the drop of a hat, fiddles with his penknife, and drives a mean looking bike! Ray Winstone gives us some laughs, but you just know what's going to happen to him by the end of the movie. Cate Blanchett is a whole other story - She's flat. Right from the outfit she's wearing to her acting. She's flat, and in some strange way, hot! There's just something about her that is so bad that she actually owns her role. Karen Allen is just there.The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will not go down well with Indiana Jones fans of the present time. Word of advice - Suspend your belief, step into the theater expecting full throttle action and adventure, like all the previous movies. C'mon, guy blocks a cannon head with a stone and it blows its face up? That's an Indy movie for you. I cannot get why people don't like this. I loved it! 8/10 overall. You ain't nothing but a hound dog, cryin all the time..!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
492,DanielRobertRoss,Aliens don't exist in a Judeo-Christian world,1,19 August 2016,"Time to finally talk about this travesty. I'm gonna treat this less as a review and more as cathartic therapy. What annoyed me more than any CGI monkeys, fridge nuking or Shia Lebeoufing, is that this film ignores it's own mythos.In the first three films, we are clearly in a world where the Judeo- Christian God exists. The Ark of the Covenant is real, and so is the Holy Grail, as proved by their supernatural abilities. Admittedly, Temple of Doom is debatable, but I would argue that it still falls into the same mythical world, because if God exists, then so does Satan, the ""Kali"" who gives Mola Ram his powers is most likely a demon.Which brings us to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Never mind that it turns the series into Sci Fi when it has always been fantasy, what rankles me much more so, is the blatant disregard for its own world building. After walking out the cinema 8 years ago, I finally understood why Phantom Menace annoyed Star Wars fans so much. Midichlorians are the same as aliens, shoving in stuff that has no place in the universe the characters live in. But admittedly my reasons for not liking Crystal Skull are pretty esoteric. For the average film fan, is there anything to like? Well, John Hurt's performance as an eccentric professor is good. Ray Winstone as Indy's duplicitous turncoat sidekick is fun, but I do miss John Ryhs Davies. Sallah was a great character in the series. And Sean Connery would've been great too, it's a shame that League of Extraordinary Gentlenen was such a bad experience it made him retire from acting.The always brilliant John Williams gives an otherwise dull movie momentum, and there are one or two enjoyable character moments and action scenes. But there's a reason that this film angered so many fans of the series (Myself included). Aliens do not belong in this universe, this is Indiana Jones, not War of the Worlds. Raiders and Last Crusade are genre classics, beloved by millions. I'm not going to pretend that Temple of Doom is a masterpiece, but at least the mine cart chase and rope bridge scene are fun. What memorable moments from Crystal Skull are there? Apart from the atomic blast survival, which is only well known because it was so over the top it started the ""nuking the fridge"" meme. Whenever I think of this film, all I remember is bad CGI, fake Russian accents and aliens. And let's talk about that CGI. Every digital shot and animal sticks out like a sore thumb. ILM must have had their A team on this film, so what possible excuse could they have for such shoddy effects work? Visually speaking, the film looks nothing like the first three. Spielberg is still one of my favorite filmmakers, but this, along with 1941 and Hook is one of his biggest missteps. Tintin, War Horse, Lincoln and Bridge of Spies were great movies though. All is forgiven Spielberg. I can't stay mad at the man who gave the world Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders and Jurassic Park. But the rumored Indy 5 better not have sodding aliens.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
493,Johnny-113,Very bad film.,3,13 June 2008,"This film is as much of a let down as ""The Phantom Menace"" was. The story was dull and extremely unfocused. The pacing was confusing. I'm not sure if it's the actors' faults (Ford and Allen) or the director's, but they were both sleepwalking through the film and seemed apathetic about everything.Just because this was directed by Steven Spielberg, doesn't mean it's a good film. This was a ridiculous film with a boring story. To spice things up, the filmmakers added campy impossible stunts (deadly waterfalls and vine swinging) to perhaps attempt to shock viewers into enjoying the film intermittently.Unlike the other Indy films, many of the sets looked like ""sets."" To sum it all up: the film was unfocused, dull, uninspired and lazy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
494,doctardis,"Great homage to 1950's ""B"" movies",8,18 October 2008,"I did not see this theaters, but just saw on DVD. Before seeing it I have heard all the negative things about it. I think they are mostly wrong. The original movies are all based on ""B"" movies of the 1930's. This more modern Indy is based on the ""B"" movies of the 1950's. It has everything, Indy fighting Russian spies, shots of F-86 fights, giant ants, nuclear tests, rebels without a cause, drag racing, the red scare, and more. All this is great, and it is all in the first half of the movie. Tieing up the Indy loose end are great as well. Bringing back Karen Allan as Marion is a master stroke. However, not enough it explained about the greater mystery. Who are the beings with the crystal skulls. In most ""B"" movies of the 1950's they were aliens trying to take over the Earth. Some were comments on the Red Scare like the thing. We know that Indy Jones thinks the aliens might be alien Indys. It would have been nice he was able to use that knowledge to save everyone or gain some insight. Also Indy does not really find the temple. He just knows how to follow his crazy friend played by John Hurt. Indiana Jones in the other movies is not just a thug. He solves mysteries. He just does not stand on the work of crazy friends. The critics who say this movie is not as realistic as the earlier one, clearly do not remember them very well. The creatures coming out of the Arc, pulling beating hearts out of people with just your hand, 800 year old knights, these are all in the more realistic Indy movies. But this movie takes you to another place, and it is fun. Maybe not as much fun as some of the earlier movies, but it is fun. Therefore it succeeds.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
495,ghettodogaudio06,Cool New Indiana Jones Movie w/ Newcomer Shea LeBeauf!,7,24 May 2008,I was excited because I got free tickets and drinks and popcorn at Cineplex so that was awesome. I used my last free Scene Tickets to take me and two other friends to Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix. Tonight me and my friend were late by like five minutes but I loved the opening with the Ruskies and Kate Blanchette's character. I thought the crazy Ukraine character played by Blanchette was one of the better performances along with Harrison Ford who is now definitely not a young guy but the action in this installment was satisfying but by no means was this the best film of the series. This film looked to be shot on film because it was nice and grainy looking in areas so thanks Spielberg and Lucas for another nice movie. I think Shea LeBeauf is a fine young actor who will for sure have further success. I love the lady from Raiders that was brought back. I enjoyed this movie more then National Treasure 2 lately. Nicholas Cage is not even a spit in the dirt as good as Harrison Ford. I am also almost done my Rambo marathon and First Blood is definitely the best yet. Stallone is also looking very old now on the new Rambo movie.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
496,DonSwanson,Don't Blame George,6,23 May 2008,"Well, my wife and I went to a later show last night. As the theater lights came up I was still trying to figure out what I thought. I knew that it was pretty good, but something wasn't right. This kept me up for awhile last night. I've finally nailed it.Yes, the CGI in the jungle was a bit weird, and Mutt ala Tarzan was just bad, though not as bad as most would have you believe. But these are all minor. Harrison Ford definitely delivers as an older Indiana Jones, and the cast was well rounded. The general story ""idea"" was solid, and I liked an older Indiana Jones in a different time period... so what was the problem? The first half of the movie is fantastic, until Indiana, Mutt, Marion and Ox are recaptured after the quicksand.Karen Allen was a delight to watch, but she was just sort of there; with the exception of a few scenes she was nothing more than something else in the background. This was a huge disappointment.Once the entire ""crew"" is together the film just becomes easy and misses so many opportunities to add some character and depth. It really is a bunch of set pieces loosely strewn together to reach the end (the end is actually pretty decent).Most people want to blame George due to the 'Star Wars' prequels. It's true, Tarzan Mutt is akin to super-happy-fun-time with C3PO in the droid factory (thankfully, much shorter), and the overkill of CGI in the jungle chase/ant sequence makes it all seem like it's nowhere remotely grounded in reality. We can likely blame George for that. Does it really negatively impact the film? No.What hurts this film is the easy gloss rush to the end with little to no depth or heart, or exactly why I despise Michael Bay. Spielberg and Bay are similar filmmakers, except Spielberg used to be able to do it (the Hollywood formula) in a human way that worked, which is what made him the best.So I started thinking, when did this happen to Steve? Spielberg still does strong dramas, as always, but when did he lose his edge for what he had become best known for? Is it just him? No. It's Spielberg and David Koepp.This really is sad, as both have done beyond superb work in the past.In short, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is just like 'War of the Worlds' in that it starts strong then reaches a point where it's all gloss with little to no heart until the end. What are the common denominators? Spielberg and Koepp. Sure, the George-ness of the CGI was a bit much, but the real problem was a script that went soft in the second half and a director who didn't do anything to maintain the heart of the film from beginning to end.Much like 'War of the Worlds' it became too easy: this, then this, then this, then this, then the end. We lost all connection to the characters as they easily, and quickly, made their way through set pieces to get to the end of the film. The very end of the film was good, and re-injected some heart, but I can't help but wonder how much more effective it might have been had we still been engaged with the characters for the 40-plus minutes preceding it.Don't blame George. This is Steven's new way of approaching action/adventure material, especially when working from a David Koepp script.FINAL VERDICT: It's not a ""bad"" movie; it's Indiana Jones for the first half and 'The Mummy Returns' for the second, with a quick return to Indiana Jones for the last few minutes. Definitely worth a view, but if you love Indiana Jones or were looking for an action/adventure film that has a little depth beyond just summer eye-candy it is ultimately a little disappointing.For the record, I am not a ""fanboy"" who expected the ""second coming.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
497,PeterWorthers,"Welcome back old friend, its great to see you again!!",10,22 May 2008,"I wish they would let you give movies more stars, but 10 will have to do. But I will admit, after hearing the reviews from critics and coming out of Cannes I was very worried about the future of the Indiana Jones franchise. I was worried for nothing. Its good to see you again old friend, welcome back! Harrison Ford is indeed back and in full form, for a guy of 100 he did some stunts in there that I don't think any of us could have done. The movie itself had a sort of classic feel, and it FELT right, like coming home, like it belonged, and it did. The action was there from the start as we are thrown into Indys current danger filled adventure without mercy and it never lets go after that, everything from fights to explosions to treasure....all the things that make up an Indy film. The story was very interesting and fast moving, taking us from a historical relic to a supernatural kingdom to a reunion with a fan favorite to a huge revelation. It did a good job of tipping its hat to previous adventures (Ark of the Covenant anyone?) and previous companions (Marcus Brody and Henry Jones Sr.) The sword fight on two moving vehicles was awesome, to say the least, and the ending (although cheesy) was a welcome, it was good to see Indy FINALLY get the girl. I was starting to feel that he had the James Bond Syndrome. Plus the ending...can anyone say setting itself up for a sequel? Even Mutt was OK, no Short Round mind you, but he was a good addition, and the scenes he has with Ford are priceless, you can tell they like working with each other. My only problems were small, 1: Mac and main villain woman had accents that were very hard to understand at times, she would have a long speech and half the time you're trying to figure out what was just said. 2: What was the deal with swinging around on the vines? That scene hurt me, it physically hurt me.3: Honestly, did you not see the whole Mutt is your son thing coming? The surprise son thing has been done too many times, but i digress. Lucas has indeed outdone himself with this one, 19 years well worth the wait. Unlike the Star Wars trilogies, the hype DOES match this films value. It is the perfect addition to the classic series and out does Last Crusade (the greatest Indy film in the trilogy) All I can say is GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Honestly, if you miss out, not only are you missing a historical return of an all American action hero, but one of the best Movies in years. A true movie experience.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
498,rneil95,Better the Second Time Around,7,6 June 2008,"After 20 years of waiting, Indiana Jones returns to the big screen. After the first time I saw this movie, I thought that the whole aliens thing was stupid and it fell way short off the mark. I liked it, just not enough. I never give up the chance of seeing a movie twice, so I did so with this. I thought it was so much better the second time around when I wasn't nearly as critical, just going to have a good time. The plot was much easier to deal with, and everything was just so much better. I even think that it ranks up there with the first. I'd be surprised if the parents who took their kids to see Raiders didn't think it was cheesy then. It's a great blockbuster, and will soon enough have it's long-reserved spot in my collection.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
499,j_graves68,"""...so this is what happens.""",5,26 May 2008,"I really, really wanted to like this movie, but THIS is what happens when you get a script written by the Spielberg/Lucas/Ford/______ committee. A mess. Of course when the stupid CGI gopher is coming out of the mound right after the Paramount logo, I should have known that this movie wasn't Lucas-proof. Indy and Marion getting married at the end (oh, how original) and that Tarzan-thing with Shia was just stupid. But I liked the first twenty minutes following the gopher-incident, and I didn't find the extra-terrestrial aspect completely appalling, being that some scientists believed that there was a possible presence with E.T.s in the Mayan and Incan civilization. But the whole spaceship-thing at the end? What happened here? Well, enough of that...I found Cate Blanchet good in her role- she definitely wasn't miscast. Shia LeBeouf was all right, but I didn't think Karen Allen was as spunky as she was in ""Raiders."" As a matter of fact, this movie was nowhere near in the ""Raiders"" ballpark. I think that Lucas and Spielberg resigned themselves to the fact that Larry Kasdan is gone, and that their ongoing films will never spark the magic the first one did because of his help. And hearing how Lucas wants to grind sh** into the ground and have Shia take on the Indiana role (hmmmwhat a surprise) IS appalling. But the movie had its moments: aside from the first twenty minutes and the Ark accidentally revealed (was that the MacGuffin Lucas boasted about?), there were reasonable action scenes (with the exception of the triple waterfalls). But that's exactly the point: I could not fully enjoy this movie and suspend the world around me for two hours like I did with the first one BECAUSE there were these exceptions which seemed to occur on an average of every two to five minutes. Just when I was starting to get into the film, something outrageous or implausible had to happen. Instead, I shook my head just like my old man did when he took me to see ""Temple of Doom"" when I was twelve. Guess that's the Lucasberg way.The dialogue was nowhere memorable- just like ""Temple of Doom""'s, and this movie makes me appreciate ""The Last Crusade"" more (which ironically WASN'T one of my faves in the franchise). However, I liked the fact that the Soviets were the bad guys in this (and I thought that Spielberg was going to instead make it a group of renegade neo-Nazis or something). And the whole Red Menace-thing in the age of McCarthyism was another aspect that I found plausible. Indiana's character grew, but he didn't calcify, and that's what makes Harrison Ford the only man on the planet who can play this character. But after three not-so-great sequels that were spawned, I think it's time for Ford to hang up his hat and whip before his whip hits him in the a$$ again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
500,ED122304_TGG,Doesn't deserve the hate,7,26 April 2018,People hate on this movie for some very picky reasons. Yes it's nowhere near as good as the original three but I personally like this movie and thought the plot was very interesting!,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
501,info-11400,Rather uninspired,4,9 June 2008,"Certainly no one of the main persons (Lucas, Spielberg, Ford) needed the money. And that makes the 4th Indiana Jones such a negative experience.IJ1 was cool, a surprise, a homage to the 1930ies cliffhangers. It's pace and timing was brilliant. IJ2 started with a beautiful 30ies musical. And it kept the speed and excitement to the end. IJ3 was the first movie of the series to contain serious lengths. It simply wasn't half as fast as part one or two. Still it was an OK movie.And now Indiana Jones 4. We see a pretty old Jones, a guy being almost 60, pretending to be 40. That is of course a sub theme of the film. An old man proving to be really cool, and definitely not thaaaat old.In order to illustrate this more vividly Indiana Jones' son is introduced as some kind of jerk. Just the perfect sidekick for the main character. This is extremely predictable and thus boring.This would have been OK, if the action and/or the story would match part one or two. Even though advertisement tries to tell us ""all stunts are real stunts"" we see a lot (a damn lot) of silly cgi effects. How boring! Novadays almost everything is possible with cgi. It all depends on the amount of money one is going to invest. Real stunts are a lot harder to film. And they look a lot more convincing. And there is by far too little credibility in IJ4! In Indiana Jones 2 we see this beautiful roller coaster ride through strange mines. But this is well integrated with the story, it is funny. In IJ4 we see Jeeps rushing through the jungle instead. CGI, no humor, reminding of King Kong's dinosaur rushing scene. And that is the deep and true problem of the film. I've seen all this before. There's nothing new! Even the final is just standard. Even though it has some nice effects, it is just cgi. Nothing really interesting.I got the impression, they just produced an Indiana Jones that uses all modern technology, but they simply forgot the main thing, the story!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
502,john_oneill41,Long wait but overall was worth it,6,3 February 2010,"It's been a long time coming but finally the fourth Indy film is here. If I'm honest I think that possibly if this had been released only a few years after Last Crusade, it would not have been as successful as previous entries in the series because, let's face it, the story's not as good as the first three. And I blame George Lucas, who although he has some great ideas, interferes too much in other parts of film-making at which he is not as good as he thinks he is.Another thing going against this film, something that no one could do anything about, is that the expectations were so high that no film could live up to them. Perhaps when Indy 5 comes, expectations will be more realistic.Harrison Ford looks amazing for a man who is 65, even though he is a Hollywood actor whose livelihood depends on his keeping in good condition. In fact, although the producers and Ford made a conscious decision not to gloss over the fact that Indy is getting on in years, there was no need, due to Ford's physical condition, to ladle it on quite as much as they did.With regard to the other characters, Ray Winstone's Mac doesn't really add anything to it. OK, he was necessary to make the scene where they nuked the fridge work, but a supporting player, similar to Alfred Molina's character at the beginning of Raiders would have done the job equally well, and then the character could have been gotten rid of. Is he a double agent? Is he a triple agent? Does anyone really care? He just wasn't needed.Mutt makes an interesting son for Indy, continuing, as Spielberg et al point out in the DVD special features, the trend of the Jones men having sons who are to say the least somewhat rebellious. Shia LaBoeff gets the right balance between having a son who is too meek and having the character being too rebellious.Irina Spalko doesn't seem to be the type of part that Cate Blanchett would normally go far, but since she is one of the best actresses ever to have worked in Hollywood, she plays the part perfectly. Karen Allen plays Marion Ravenwood exactly them same as in Raiders, so she can't be faulted either.Despite it's faults, Indy 4 is highly recommended.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
503,jackharding89-1,Leave Indy alone!!...,5,25 May 2008,"19 years post-crusade and the sealing of, perhaps, the greatest high- concept trilogy of the blockbuster era comes the fourth and long awaited instalment in the Indian Jones adventures. The year is 1957, which means Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is pushing 70. Yes, 70. And with the Nazis trodden and beaten to every religious artefact the bible can conjure, Indy's now fighting his own in-land space race with those pesky Soviets. Destination? Somewhere in the Amazon. More specifically: The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, hence the title. And with fortune and glory still at the fore, our ageing archaeology lecturer-cum-globe trotting buccaneer, whip in hand n' hat on head, teams up with some old friends and new in an attempt to pip the Cate Blanchett's reds to the prize. Unfortunately, though, many die-hard Indy fans the world over will exit cinemas feeling somewhat downcast, letdown and a little ripped-off. Gutted, even, as many will be left feeling as if the future of their every-man hero was best left unpreserved as he galloped off into the sunset with Dad and Marcus, not knowing who or what lied ahead. Despite Spielberg, Lucas and co's best efforts to rekindle the Indy flame that single handily put the love and magic back into movies, too many aspects of the Crystal Skull are over-simplified and modernised, dramatised and CGI'd. That winning formula that first spilled onto our screens back in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark has been altered, restructured and, well, ruined. There are still dozens of chase scenes, pleasantry slapstick moments, creepy crawlers and quirky one-liners to keep viewers entertained, and the manner in which several loose ends are tied will bring a smile to the face of every Indy fan, but the fourth and ultimately pointless instalment lacks the classic whip and crack of the original trio. Even Harrison Ford's performance (in what has to be considered as his signature role) is flat. The charisma is still there, but only just. On a personal note, it's rather sad to see Ford join the likes of Stallone as a once larger than life Hollywood star whose iconographic qualities and ability to grab a hold of our hearts just ain't what it used to be. His performance as the elderly Indy may mark the end of a fantastic screen career filled with excitement, talent, class and countless memories. Co-star and ruthless nemesis Cate Blanchett, on the other hand, is superb. The Oscar winning Aussie actress gives a highly- convincing and down-right forbidding performance as the obsessed Russian chief Irina Spalko. Rising Hollywood star Shia LeBouef is, once again, excellent; fresh and excitingly raw in his portrayal of the feisty greaser Mutt.Despite the uplifting performances of the newly founded editions to the Indy saga, though, (including our Ray Winstone) the archaic, grainy texture that ran so rich and raw through Raiders, Temple and Crusade is nowhere to be seen in Crystal. The Raiders-esque Paramount production fade-in to a gofer mound is, all be it shrewd, highly misleading. Very little else succeeds in capturing the wonderment and sheer escapism of the treasured trilogy. Even John Williams underperforms as, other than the classic ""duu du du duu du du duuu"", very little atmosphere is created to either compliment or add substance to the celluloid. Remember the chills that darted up your spine as Williams' esteemed score kicked in as Indy located the Well of Souls in the Egyptian map room chamber? Or the horror you felt as Mola Ram extracted the heart from a Thugee slave? Well, expect little of the same from the Crystal skull. It's a tolerable action/adventure flick. But nothing more.In essence, I'm afraid it's an all-round case of too little, too late. Entertaining? Yes. Conventional? Yes. A must see? For any Indy fan, again, yes. But don't expect a memorable summoning of the inspired magic that burnt so brightly in the Crystal's predecessors. That's not to say it won't gross handsomely at the box-office, though. Remember The Phantom Menace? No? George Lucas does",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
504,gevalero,OK but hardly an event.,6,23 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is about as good as one could expect after all these years, the biggest problem with it is that while I remember the excitement-a-minute of the first two films, I have to say my pulse didn't jump much during this new one. My biggest complaint about the movie has to do with the complexity of the plot. Two thirds into the film I had no idea what exactly Indy was going after. Remember how in Raiders every bit of the way you felt how critical it was for Indy to get the Ark ? Not here. As a result I just didn't care too much about what was going on. I also don't think Shia LaBeouf has the chops for inheriting the Indiana Jones role, I have no idea who does but certainly not him. I suppose you just can't expect Spielberg and Lucas to catch thunder in a bottle (see Raiders) and one has to value this new film for what it is: a rather good time at the movies, nothing more.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
505,kelboy10,Unfortunate with no glory kid!,5,11 January 2021,"I loved the first three Indiana Jones films but this one falls well short of what we expect from Spielberg. I watched this recently on prime of the second time after watching it in the cinema when it was released. I know why I didn't like it then and although I tried to watch it again with an open mind I still couldn't bring myself to like or forgive it! The main antagonist is weak, the plot is by far the worst and the characters and acting isn't has empathetic or emotional. Sure there are some cheap laughs from time to time but it all seemed to forced with Ray Winston. Sean Connery couldn't be replaced it seemed. The CGI in the monkey forest looked like it was computerised, almost video game like. It appears you can't beat practical stunts and the physical objects Infront of you. Harrison Ford done his best but nothing felt real anymore. I can still watch the old ones and enjoy them now and can't say that about this movie. It feels forgettable, like the new Tomb Raider or something. This isn't even as strong as Temple of Doom that had better stunts and action. To me I'll always be a trilogy this one doesn't exist and should've never been considered",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
506,gbx06,There's nothing better than yesterday,7,9 July 2008,"This was one of the movies that I most have expected of this summer. I got to the cinema thinking about all those memories that had about the archaeologist hero who wears a hat and uses a whip, I must admit that I'm a Indiana Jones fan and that's the reason why I expected this fourth delivery to see what happens now with this character. At the end of the film I didn't know what I have to think, was it good?, Was a good story? What happened to Indiana Jones? Now, time later, I clarified that I felt about the film, which although has the essence of the saga, contain a lot of elements that make it feel distant. First the successes: The story is more or less good, changing Nazis by Russian communists follows the line par excellence stalls the dichotomy of good versus evil, the environment reflected by a successful design art leads us to live at that time, the winks to previous tapes (especially Radiers ...) make the public, who saw the first film, smile, the constant jokes, that break moments of tension and print the stamp Lucas-Spielberg and especially the final thought that raised the idea that there will be more Indiana Jones's movies, and although the years to weigh the protagonist, has not yet established the generational transition from father to son, this makes us live again on the movie.All these details fit with the earlier deliveries but unfortunately there are some elements that destroy everything that has been achieved: the many historical references that make it implausible everything that happened between The Last Cruised and this new tape, a script that is only a projection of Spielberg and Lucas fixations, this is, in my view, the worst mistake (introducing aliens, spacecrafts and an endless number of galactic things that detract from the excitement and enthusiasm caused by the legend of Jones, plus some other details, such as the nuclear explosion, that within the world incredible raised during all Jones's films jump to make it even harder to believe and especially to assimilate.There is no doubt that I have mixed emotions in front of this movie, I don't know yet if I was wanting to see another movie about an archaeologist with hat and whip or live of illusions and the legend created in Raiders ... I don't have it clear, the only thing that actually I'm sure is that however I prefer yesterday.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
507,paq5528,Not up to par,6,1 June 2008,"While it is true that the bar was set rather high for this film, it would also be true that the goal was attainable. Unfortunately, this film ticks off the boxes on what made much of the previous films great, without ever being anywhere that good itself.There were so many ""long-shots"" come-true that they became impossible to ignore. While such things were the odd and amazing throw-in in previous movies, they were jammed into this movie more than sardines in a can. I don't want to write specific ones because I don't want spoilers, but collectively, let me just say that the stretches of logic and imagination are a serious distraction from the film. And the ending fits in more with the flights of fancy of George Lucas than with the reality of a mid-1900's archaeologist.All in all, I'd wait for it to come out on TV; and no, I wouldn't buy the DVD. The movie might be good to watch one time, but I'd not waste another 2 hours to watch it again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
508,epatters-3,Good not great.,7,25 May 2008,"Warning this comment might contain spoilers. This movie was good not great, I liked it, but there were some flaws, Like the alien thing and the terrible CGI. It was not as good as Raiders or Crusade but it was better then Temple of Doom. It was cool that I got to see a Indiana Jones Picture in the theatre. I had a fun time watching the movie. Shia's character was better then short round in my opinion. It was fun watching and if your a fan of the series then you should get some enjoyment from this one. I recommend this film to any fan of the first 3. Well to me, the series is no longer a trilogy. It was not bad. Some scenes that I did like, Some scenes that I did not like. So, My over all rating is 7 out of 10 stars. Go see it if you haven't.

509,brownish33,"Indiana Jones is an old fashioned hero, and that makes him great!!",10,8 September 2008,"i know the title of my review is strange, but personally i think that maybe the reason the movie is getting some negative reviews from younger users (yes, most IMDb users are usually teens/20 somethings) is because they want ""badass"" hero these days and not the triumphant wisecracking teacher hero like Indiana Jones. just look at how well ""the dark knight"" is doing and how good the reviews are. thats not just because the hype ( which is all it is for the most part) but because ppl these days seem to want darker more twisted hero's then any of this old fashioned more innocently made stuff. Indiana Jones is a hero of yesteryear, and todays audience isn't into that. lets admit, the 80's was the heyday of Indiana Jones, back when it was fresh and new and it brought a new kind of adventure and intrigue like a blast from the past and ppl were interested again. nowadays, in these post 9/11 days, what relevance does Indy have? well, the new batman movies are really banking off of the 9/11 catastrophe's with the way they are going for gritty realism and buildings exploding etc, but Indy is a movie that is written and feels like it was made in the 1950's, not a film you would expect to see in 2008. it doesn't have what most young ppl want these days: a hot babe, scary serial killing villain, blood/gore everywhere, dark and weird. its not like that at all, its just a fun, family friendly action adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously. yes ford is older but that is just one small little problem i can see people having, but it seems to me that young people of today are simply not interested in these kinda of movies. this new Indy film felt more like Spielberg's fantasy film Hook then it did anything else. critics i don't count, they were already going to bash the new Indy, but regular audience, i just think Indy did well because ppl were curious about it, but the negative reviews are IMO because Indy's time has passed and sadly, younger audiences want a hero or movies in general that are darker and more sinister and killer. sad but true. Indy is too ""old"" and ""old fashioned"" it seems for many of todays younger generation. tis why i usually don't agree or get along with ppl my age (I'm 21), they want to see all that gross weird crap that i for the most part am not interested in. we NEED more movies like this and need to get away a little bit from all that dark weird stuff and back to the lighter stuff (although Tim Burton, you can make all that stuff anytime you want cuz you are a genius lol). i myself though, am not a huge scifi fan besides a few major blockbusters that were fun(star wars, ID4, Matrix, Predator 1), but i think the one change i still find myself having a problem with is the aliens. its just....not Indy at all, if you take the last 3 films into consideration. the last 3 had to do with supernatural elements, and that fit Indy perfectly. but then this one had things like aliens and area 51 and UFO's...i mean its not that i hated the film at all, but this still bugs me. i always kinda scoff at stuff like that cuz its so silly. i don't believe in aliens, but i do believe in the Bible. yes, i will not deny that this probably has something to do with my only problem with KOTCS. I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who feels this way. I'm also not saying that i believe everything the 2 ""biblical"" Indy films did. i don't believe that if the Ark was really found it would melt people like a microwave, or that the holy grail would have a lone knight guarding it for 700 years. that stuff is pure fantasy, but the films are based in reality and a Faith that is real to millions for thousands of years. then you switch that to something as silly as aliens and it just loses some of its magic or importance. however I'm glad that most of the film felt and looked like classic Indy with the ""scifi"" parts like area 51 and the alien and the UFO at the end being only a few minutes long. however, it helps when you take into consideration that this film was not intended to be a clone of the other 3 films, which were homages to the 30's adventure films, but was supposed to be more like those silly 50's B movie scifi adventure's. i think looking at it like that makes it more acceptable for what it is",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
510,MovieKen,Disappointing,3,28 May 2008,"Like many others, I was also disappointed by this film. Certainly there were aspects of the film that would be familiar to long-time fans of the franchise. But in general, this movie doesn't seem much different to me than any random action/adventure film of the past 10-15 years. In fact, I thought both National Treasure films were better than this was.I read another review that said the script could have been written by an 11 year-old. I can't agree more - the writing for this movie was far below the other Indiana Jones films. The adventure itself was rather boring, and the ending was extremely disappointing. I can't believe the rejected scripts were all worse than this was, despite what Lucas has said.It's a common trend these days to hide a bad script and shallow plot with lots of computer animation and CGI. Most action/adventure films do this. This movie is definitely a victory of style over substance. It's fun to watch at times, but when you leave the theater, you feel like you've just eaten too much cotton candy.I don't usually let goofs made in film-making bother me too much. But this one made blatant errors in geography and history that should not have been made at all. Indiana Jones is a university professor of archeology, and he's supposed to be an archaeological genius. For him to talk about the ancient Maya in Peru is just inexcusable. I'm not an archaeologist, but even I know there never were any Maya in Peru, because they lived thousands of miles away from there.This mistake and many other geographical and historical errors made this movie insulting to anyone who paid attention in Ancient Civilizations class in high school. Just because the people making this film don't know the difference doesn't mean the character shouldn't. These geographical and historical mistakes are fatal for a movie that is supposed to be historically-based. Many people have said if you go with low expectations, this film won't be a disappointment. It sounds great in theory, but compare this film to any of the previous Indiana Jones films (yes, even compared to the Temple of Doom). Should it really be too much to ask for us to see an entertaining film with deep characters, an interesting storyline, an intelligent script, exciting action and adventure, etc.? So I don't buy this argument. I don't go to a new restaurant and expect the food to taste like a cardboard box. I expect to have a good time when I go to the movies, and not look down at my watch 2-3 times, wondering how much longer this film will last.Bottom Line: Lucas, Spielberg and Ford have plenty of money already. They don't deserve to make any more if they make junk like this. If you have to see it, save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD. That shouldn't be too long.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Sure it's no where near as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or Last Crusade but it's still very entertaining in its own way and I'd rather watch this than Temple of Doom any day. I mean I think Temple of Doom is the worst out of the Indiana Jones movies because I thought it had a lot of stupid characters like the lead lady and the Asian kid as Indy's sidekick and I didn't like the voodoo magic in it either. In fact, it kind of felt more like some kind of kids' movie than and Indiana Jones movie. I've heard people say they hate this movie because of the fridge scene or the aliens or the wedding or the CGI or the monkeys. But I think the problem is sometimes people these days take movies too seriously. I mean I enjoyed the action and I think it had a good story to it and I like how they brought Karen Allen back as Marion. And even Shia LaBeouf was good even though I don't really like him. And I thought Cate Blanchett was good as the villain.

I really thought that since Indy is getting old that he considers retiring or at least leaving away his adventure life to his son mutt. I couldn't believe that he had a son. And that Marion is back for the thrill of being near Indy again. I think that it was good that she married him and that Mutt is the son of the greatest adventurer and explorer of his time. I really thought that Mutt would go back to school and learn everything his father learned and become adventurous too.

513,rabrenner,Indiana Jones and the War On Terror,6,27 May 2008,"The most interesting thing about the new Indiana Jones movie is that Indiana Jones is blacklisted. Unlike the previous Indiana Jones movies, which were set in the forties during World War II, INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDONM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is set in the fifties during the Cold War. Instead of Nazis, the bad guys are Russian commies who seem to have stepped out of FROM Russia WITH LOVE. When Jones is forced to help the Russkies steal an alien corpse from Area 51 (yes, we are getting into X-FILES territory here), he is accused by the FBI of being a Red. The Bureau leans on Jones' university, and he loses his professorship.This can be interpreted as a subtle Hollywood dig at the Bush administration's war on their terror, and their ""you're either with us or against us"" mentality. The clincher comes when a general defends Jones, citing all the medals he was awarded during WWII. ""Yes,"" the FBI agent replies, ""if he really earned them,"" sounding uncannily like one of the SWIFT boaters attacking John Kerry.The rest is pretty much by the numbers. Both Harrison Ford and Karen Allen seem a little long in the tooth for this kind of action/adventure flick. Shia LaBeouf is thrown in to provide some youth appeal, but looks ridiculous trying to play a cross between James Dean in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE and Marlon Brando in THE WILD ONES (with a little bit of TARZAN thrown in for good measure). There's lots of exposition, indicating script problems. There are a lot of chase scenes, but none of them have the wit or impact of the first film. Only Kate Blanchett comes off well as the leader of the Russkies; one wonders what she could do with the sort of roles that are usually offered to Angelina Jolie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I went to see this the first day it opened at the first showing in my theater. The first and third Indiana Jones movie was absolutely amazing, and I was hoping the last movie wouldn't be like the second Indiana Jones film. And it wasn't.The beginning started off with a blast, but not a shocking blast as the great parts in the beginning were all seen in the trailer. Shia LaBeouf pulled off his Marlon Brando act on his motorcycle as Harrison Ford rambled on about legends that we shockingly soon find out aren't just myths. There were a few (but only a few) dull and cliché moments, but overall I stayed entertained at the most part.There was this one memorable scene in the movie where Indiana Jones and Cate Blanchett's character Irina Spalko were chasing each other as Shia LaBeouf swung in the trees and Harrison Ford jumped cars. That one scene itself made the entire movie for me.I was a little upset with John Willams soundtrack for this film. Usually in the past films his music gets you all hyped up, but this soundtrack just didn't seem at par.The classic Indiana Jones movie were made 18 years ago, and with the advance in film technology the special effects really made this movie look surprisingly less realistic. Although extremely cool, I just couldn't take the second last scene of the movie seriously. With George Lucas aside Spielberg, I am sure you will be able to understand the reasoning for this film being much different special effects wise.Throughout the theater, I heard everyone laugh, jump in shock and clap in the end.

It was great watching Harrison Ford duke it out with Russians and as always the production design was incredible. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (you'll know it when you see it) was absolutely jaw-dropping.This film also has a great sense of humor too. Admitted, there are a fair share of scenes that get a bit silly or over the top, but then again, what's an ""Indiana Jones"" movie without a bit of far-farfetchedness? Just go into the movie with neutral expectations; expect a few mistakes and iffy parts, but enjoy the entertainment that's being presented. There are numerous references to previous ""Jones"" features and even to ""Star Wars,"" so that was fun too. Overall I can't really complain; this was the most fun I've had at the theater in quite a while. Not much else to say except to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
516,jctundis,"Pretty good, but far from great.",5,26 May 2008,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, my first reaction was ""Oh, no. They waited ten years too long and this just isn't working."" That turned out to be partly true, but not to the depths of awfulness that I first feared.Many of the sets look as if they are on a Hollywood sound stage - that is, this movie appears to have extremely low production values. Also, a couple of the more brightly lit Ford scenes were filmed with so much blur that I thought I was watching a Barbara Walters special.Harrison Ford may have done some of his own stunts, but I find it difficult to believe. There was such a disconnect between how he moves regularly (although he is amazingly fit for a man in his late sixties) and some of the stunt sequences that I just couldn't suspend my disbelief.And speaking of disbelief, Steven Spielberg has developed a habit of putting at least one incredibly stupid scene in each of his films as if to prove that he can, and no other logical reason (for example, the hamburger frying scene in Minority Report - or the Chris Rock robot in AI). Thankfully, this time it happens early on so you're able to get over the groaning and get on with the rest of the film.The fourth installment twists in some different ways genre-wise than the previous installments and fits the '50s era fairly well, in my opinion - although even the great Cate Blanchett couldn't save the villains from becoming utterly one-dimensional. The return of an old familiar face was certainly a joy.All in all, it's a fair effort - but given the sheer talent involved, I had to give it only a 5 out of 10. It's not as bad as Temple Of Doom, but given all the time and planning that went into it, it really could have and should have been better.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
517,Critomaton,The Citizen Kane of uninspired movies,4,19 July 2008,"I like the Indiana Jones trilogy, at least 2/3 of it. True, I was always unsettled by the creepy subtext of Raiders - the idea that the Ark of the Covenant had some neutral power that could be wielded by the Nazis as easily as the Allies, as if the God of Israel was indifferent to the Nazis. I know, I know, they got their faces melted off in the end, but if Henry Jones was actually a student of history he wouldn't have worried for a second about the Nazis getting hold of it.That said, of course Raiders was a great movie, and The Last Crusade also worked well, while Temple of Doom was, well, it was, well... responsible for the invention of the PG-13 rating, which is just one of many bad things that can be said about it.Still, in all, the one thing I can now say about Temple of Doom is, it wasn't nearly as boring as Indy 4. This movie doesn't deserve the honor of typing out its full name.It has some nice references to earlier aspects of the series, and it brings back Karen Allen, and there was a picture of Sean Connery on a desk somewhere, but, um... we waited 20 years for this? I couldn't possibly spoil this movie if I tried. I fell asleep during the ""climax"" of the movie. I think it had something to do with putting a skull back where it belonged.This may be the first film I can recall where not only did the trailer show the best parts, it may have actually been more exciting than the movie itself.Harrison Ford seems like a nice guy. But I'd rather have my eyelids taped open and be forced to watch Mosquito Coast or Six Days, Seven Nights (or is it vice versa?) than have to sit through Indy 4 again.This movie was really dull and disappointing, but it wasn't actually ""bad"" enough to warrant a 1 or 0 rating - if it was that bad it would be more memorable. Considering the crap that Hollywood regularly turns out, it is better than some other recent films, but considering what is expected from Spielberg and Lucas (or at least was 20+ years ago), Indy 4 is just plain insulting to the audience.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

519,asiduodiego,Not as bad as you might think,6,19 March 2011,"Lucas-bashing has become a nerd sport of sorts in the last decade for his infamous and decidedly mediocre ""Prequel Trilogy"" of Star Wars. So, I was expecting that ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" would have its reputation hurt as a byproduct of the Lucas-bashing. And indeed it suffered: the fridge, the gophers, the monkeys, Shia LaBeouf, the (spoilers!) alien, etc. For the fans, everything was wrong, stupid and unbelievable. ""Yeah, I can accept a movie where some evil looking dude can rip the heart from some other dude's chest, but, the fridge?, that's just stupid!"".But, when you accept this movie for what it is: A nostalgic nod to some action flicks in the 80s (which, in turn, were nostalgic nods to action flicks in the 50s), you can appreciate it more: just a dumb action-fantasy movie, nothing more, nothing less. The direction by Steven Spielberg is decent, but the story is somewhat lazy: some characters feel forced, and there's some sloppy writing ((spoilers!) ""Triple agent""?, give me a break). The acting is also somewhat dull: Shia LaBeouf is just mediocre in the role of Mutt Williams. But Ford delivers as good as ever, and also Karen Allen gives us an acceptable performance. The action is fine and it has good moments from here to there. Some plot devices (as the fridge) were stupid, perhaps, but, again, I don't remember anyone complaining for using a inflatable boat as a parachute.In the end, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is just a mediocre film, but not as bad as you might think. It doesn't have much endurable appeal, but has its moments, and, at the very least, it's fun, which is more than I can say of the Star Wars Prequels.6/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
520,merdiolu,"What happens when you take out mysticism , unpredictability and thrill out of Indiana Jones ?",3,31 May 2008,"Simple. You get Indiana Jones : The Kingdom of Crystal Skull. A bland and banal copy of Mummy...Now let's not be too harsh. It seems Spielberg has done a real effort in production department of this movie. Unlike some of his failures (""War of Worlds"") he caught up ""let's have fun"" era of 1950'ies with communist witch-hunt paranoia very well.Unfortunetely my praise and only good things I came up with latest Indiana Jones installment ends right up here. Again there is too much use of CGI ( it seems that Lucas learned nothing from last Star Wars trilogy maybe even considers it a success ) And action is too over the top even for silliest Indiana Jones tripe. Indy surviving a nuclear blast by hiding inside a fridge , Shia LeBeouf swinging from vines with monkeys attacking bad guys , Indy and his gang surviving three waterfalls , sword duel between cars going full speed in jungle....all of this indicates the movie and producers do not take themselves seriously. Then why audience should ? Main problem looks like George Lucas again. As usual lately he oversimplifies everything in story for mass appeal. The main story here Crystal Skulls and Aliens do not have the edge , grittiness and darkness of previous Indy movies (just remember Ark of Covenant , Shankara Stones , Holy Grail ) More than that holy objects in original trilogy had historical relevance and values. Crystal Skulls and aliens are just a urban myth not given much through in archeology or ancient history. They did not even have much ties in pre Colombian South American history and civilizations. As a result this movie does not have the epic standards of previous ones..More than that editing and character dialogue and interaction is all wrong. For example at the beginning of movie Indy and his friend Mac seen as captives of Russians were brought to Area 51 (unbelievebly bad security in a high profile depot like this ) But how ? Why ? Nobody knows. In the middle of movie the whole gang escape from bad guys with big fireworks but got captured a few minutes later again ! Just to show a funny scene on swamp. Henry Jones is mostly himself as usual. Harrison Ford actually surprised me with all stunts and fight scenes he performed at his age. But unfortunately most of the all characters fell face down although cast was mostly impressive. I had grudge against Shia LaBeouf since Transformers mess but here when handled good material he holds up well against Ford (except swinging from vines) But veteran actors like John Hurt , Cate Blanchett were completely wasted with forgettable characters and bad writing. Ray Winstone as Mac does nothing but being greedy and betraying Indy (straight ripped from a similar ""Mummy"" character) , Prof Oxley played by John Hurt was definitely written for Sean Connery and his character as Prof Henry Jones First. A poor substitute even with a marvelous actor like Hurt. Karen Allen can not act worth a damn. Blanchett was a complete comic opera copy of Natasha from ""Boris & Natascha"" series with her hair style and ridiculous Russian accent. She and her Russian goons does not have the menacing attitude of Nazis or crazy Thuggie fanatics. Involving Communists as bad guys was another mistake on that part. You can have some sympathies for Russians on that era (these people won and survived WWII after all) but you can not associate yourself with Nazis or cult fanatics.Summary : Indiana Jones The Kingdom of Crystal Skull is a poor movie compared original Indy trilogy. It is entertaining in some parts. But copycat ending of villain (articraft she seeked killed her just like in previous movies ) , plot holes (how the hell did they get out of jungle at the end ? ) and tongue in cheek finale (Indy becoming an associate dean and marrying Marion although there was no relationship between them for ages) disappointed me more than I imagined. Hollywood really needs to stop ruining classic movies and trilogies with sequels and remakes because there is a shortage of original thinking and imagination. This movie seems to be made just due to immense fan and studio pressure to make profit nothing more...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

What I loved was the fact they incorporated elements of all 3 films like the arc of the covenant being scene in the opening part & all the snakes & bugs like in the temple of doom & the humor & double act from Indy & his son very similar to the double act of the last crusade with Indy & his father .It was also a great touch bringing back Indy's love interest from the first film , what I also loved was the story & setting it in the 50's gave more scope like the nuclear test , the cold war etc . The action was from start to finish some people will say it's far fetched as in the alien side of it but remember the ghost like beings that came out of the arc in the first film it's just fantasy & it's AWESOME go see it you wont be disappointed .",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

523,ZekeRage911,Kingdom of the Cryingly Dull,4,7 April 2010,"All right, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a good movie either. Here's the thing, it's not an Indiana Jones movie. I don't care if Indiana Jones is in it, his name is in the title, and Harrison Ford plays the title character, it's NOT an Indiana Jones movie.It all comes down to style. Indiana Jones had style. He was a rugged adventurer with grit, wit, and grim determination. He was clever, quick witted, and good in a fight. And to his credit, Harrison Ford plays an aged version of Indy very well, almost too well, to the point where I can't tell if it's a script line about him being tired of it all, or if he's actually griping about being in the movie.But this movie has no style, and little substance. The plot reads like an X-Files adventure without the atmosphere. It's more like a sequel to the Mummy, or Tomb Raider. This is Indiana Flippin' Jones! If you can't be bothered to at least try, why should I be bothered to pay? This is the fundamental flaw in Hollywood. They don't understand bad from good.Everything about this story is rushed together with little cohesion or intelligence. There's almost no detective work, no startling revelations, and the first ten minutes spends more time insulting my intelligence than entertaining me. Yes, I see the ark there, how clever. Oh, they stored it in Area 51, yes, cute. Oh, good, some barely mentioned subplot about Red Paranoia. And Indy survives a nuclear bomb test by hiding inside a fridge? This isn't Indiana Jones, this is asinine! Oh, and whoever cast Shia Lebouf as Indy's son (YES, INDIANA JONES'S SON!) should be beaten with a hammer.Here's the problem, Indiana Jones is a legend in and of himself. Now I didn't expect this movie to be good, but I at least expected it to be an Indiana Jones movie. I don't even care about the aliens, the green screen special effects, or the Russians as the bad guys. Indiana Jones doesn't get married, he dies a heroes death like a real man would! He vanishes mysteriously leaving a long lost son/pupil/apprentice to find him and take the torch from. He doesn't marry the girl from the first movie just so we can rob the franchise of what little dignity it had left after the LEGO version. This is not an Indiana Jones movie, and both Spielberg and Lucas should have their money taken away until they sit down and make this movie properly.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
524,IAN-Cinemaniac,Crystal Skull Is Never Dull,6,21 May 2008,"I was 17 when the last Indy film came out in '89...yes I'm that old. I loved the Indy films. ""Raiders"" was by far the best and ""Last Crusade"" remains the second best for me. Even when I first saw ""Temple Of Doom"" I thought it was pretty lame and over-the-top, so it still remains the least engaging of the bunch. Which leads me to ""Crystal Skull,"" the third best of the series. I was so excited to catch the latest Indy today in Belgium. Ever since I saw ""Last Crusade"" I've been anticipating a new Indy and ""Crystal Skull"" delivers the goods...I repeat ""goods"", not greats. There are some great Speilbergian moments but the film rarely soars. As with ""Temple Of Doom,"" ""Crystal Skull"" is too cute at times and goes way too far over- the-top and unfortunately Lucas' special effects can't do the scripts imagination justice. So much of this film looks so fake that it makes it hard to believe or even really care. I must say it was great to see the older Indy in action and Shia was a nice addition, but this franchise has seen better, more energetic days. Too often the film got bogged down by too many characters. It felt like Indy was the Pied Piper who kept on collecting more and more followers. The first half is pretty solid, but the second half gets too bogged down in weak stunts and lackluster special effects. If you love Indy then you'll definitely like this film, just make sure to check your brain and critical eye at the door. ""Crystal Skull"" is never dull but it's also never ""Raiders"" or ""Last Crusade.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
525,paulmamak,A controversial ending to the legendary saga,6,23 May 2008,"Overall, this film had potential, but a lot was lacking in order for it to live up to its name as an Indiana Jones film. The film could have done with a better villain, as even though Blanchett played her role convincingly, she did not even come close to the main villains in the previous three films. The film could have also done without Winstone, as his character was not at all realistic and was just simply annoying. The action sequences consisted of too much use of CGI, which made them seem too unrealistic, causing the film to lose that edge of being a B movie. Shiah LeBouef as Mutt deserves great appraisal for his outstanding acyting skills. However, Karren Allen as Marion Ravenwood had very little development throughout the film, which made the ending marriage ceremony seem a little too far-fetched. A better plot would have consisted of using Abner Ravenwood as opposed to that Ox character, as not only would it have tied to film together more strongly, but it would have ended the saga by enabling it to return to the origins of Raiders, completing the circle. The fridge saving Jones from a nuclear explosion was simply impossible. The fact that the crystal skull was in fact of extraterrestrial beings is highly controversial, but considering that the previous three films also dealt with supernatural forces does not really make it that much of a big deal. Since there is a field called xenoarcheology, this film therefore has put Jones's skills in an entirely new form of light.Indiana Jones has been a true cinematic icon, even though this film did not live up to its expectations, at least he is happily married with a son to carry on the adventurer's name.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
526,MacBalthus,Another legend has been spoiled,1,28 May 2008,"I love the first 3 Indy flicks. They are the best adventure movies I can think of. The action is great, the humor is witty and there's hardly one boring minute in three films. 19 years it took the creators George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to launch the fourth adventure. It should have been started earlier, but it's stated they weren't happy with the script.Now what the heck is there to be happy with in the script of this one?! It's a pile of disgraceful nonsense! There were two good moments in this movie: One would be the barroom brawl, two the chase in the jungle right until the damn ants appeared. Everything else, literally every last bit of the film, was a pure insult to the mythology.I'm gonna spoil big time right here so if you really wanna watch this accident, stop reading.BIG SPOILER!!!Indy vs. Alien? What the hell were they thinking? It was such a nice trilogy with great artifacts as keys to the story. Terrestrial artifacts. Now we have a very very very poorly animated alien that can split up itself into 13 crystal skeletons. I haven't seen such a cheap story in any of the known TV series. End of the BIG SPOILER!!Besides this horrible mistake, the rest was boring. Really boring. The attempts of escapes were not even close as entertaining and creative as in the earlier films. The characters, even Indy himself, are lame! Steven Spielberg, who clearly lost his skills and maybe his mind too, has stated they weren't gonna use too many digital effects in this one. Rubbish!

527,daveygandthekeyboard,Implausible action scenes kill this movie,5,2 June 2008,"All I can really conclude about this movie is that it was just okay. I can forgive the ludicrous plot, the cheesy ""family"" dynamic of the film, the fact that Harrison Ford is old (which is really nowhere near the worst part of this). I don't even really mind Shia LaBeouf's presence. But many of the stunts and the action scenes are so implausible that it renders all of the action scenes implausible. For example, Shia LaBoeuf sword-fighting (!) spread-eagled on two moving vehicles; a boat going over not one, not two, but three waterfalls with absolutely no one getting a scratch (I mean, what are we watching here, The A-Team?); and the ""if the film hasn't jumped the shark yet it certainly has now"" moment--Shia LaBoeuf swinging through the jungle a la Tarzan. It was ridiculous. And because these parts are (forgive my overuse of the word) implausible, it highlights the fact that the rest of it doesn't work, either. After seeing a number of old series trying to come back for another run (Rocky Balboa, Rambo, the Star Wars Prequels) I have concluded that when filmmakers attempt to cash in on a once-popular series, artistically the best they can hope for is to break even. Sometimes there really is nowhere to go but down. I wanted to love this, but the most charitable thing I can say is that it was just okay.

The other Indiana Jones movies are over the top, no doubt, but this seems excessive somehow. I don't know where the line was crossed, but it might have been somewhere between Shia LaBeouf becoming King of the Monkeys and the kingdom ruled by magical extra-dimensional aliens. Nevertheless, it's still far ahead of all the Indy imitators that have popped up over the years, like the National Treasure and the Mummy movies. I must admit I've missed Indiana Jones and Harrison Ford does return in top form. My worries about Shia LaBeouf were unjustified because he did a fine job as well. Karen Allen returning for a happy ending with Indy was a great idea for my money; and Cate Blanchett, who is always awesome, does very well considering the stereotypical ""Kill Moose and Squirrel"" character that she is given. The plot is absolutely ridiculous and the final scene doesn't really give you any closure; I was left wondering what the point was of all that.

I mean, this is so ridiculous like when Christian Bale was thinking he is playing Shakespeare while filming Terminator4 and freaks out because someone dared to disturb the grand maestro.The 'Mac' George Michale character, the obligatory Jar Jar Binks in a Lucas movie, this time non-digital.The aliens: Howard the Duck after he turned to the dark side and became Darth Crystal.Karen Allen, the annoying 'kid' (Spielberg) constantly doing very stupid things without realizing it (*grin*) although Shia LaBeouf is also a good candidate for this part, double true!

531,teodorodontosaurus,"Bland, boring, lazy and uninspired",5,25 April 2018,"So, why is this movie a failure?
Is it because of the unrealistic scenes or over the top acting? No, those aspects are present in the original trilogy too (although some scenes here make the other movies look like documentaries).
Is it because of the sci-fi theme? Are aliens a problem? I don't actually think this is the problem either, although this idea feels forced and uninspired; remember that the other Indiana Jones movies have a fantasy vibe.
So what's the real problem?
Simple. It's just extremely poorly written and directed; it's lazy and uninspired. Ironically, the use of CGI also ruins this movie. The action scenes are not very intense and thrilling, even with all that CGI business.

534,lucasaq-1,A Good Old-Fashioned Adventure Film in the Vein of the Previous Films,8,22 May 2008,"This delivers in spades what any Indiana Jones film should, a lot of action and adventure. It is not as original as the first film nor as grotesque as the second film not to mention the corniness involved in that film. I guess the third film might be an apt comparison except it does not include the normal batch of villains and includes no father figure like Sean Connery played. Instead, the new ingredient of this film and its running fuel is a much older Indy and a fun ensemble of new and old characters. Chief among the returning cast members is lovable Marion, Indy's first love in the first film Raiders. Technically, she is not the first I guess although I am not sure about the time-frame of the fiasco that happened before Raiders. Anyways, the point is that is great to have a great strong female cast member opposite Indy in this film, which adds lots of fun to the film with their fun banter.Chief among the new cast members are Cate Blanchett as the Russian psychic foe who is every bit as tough, smart, and determined not to mention a bit thick in the head as most of Indy's previous foes. Blanchett over plays her role perfectly and makes for a fun villain who we do not mind getting the obligatory gruesome demise. On the side of the good, there is also a very big new comer in Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams a greaser at the start who morphs into something much more. He makes up some of the more agile required stunts as a student of Indy to some degree. It offers a lot more opportunity for action than in previous films as Indy does not have to do everything.Ray Winstone in this film gets an interesting job as well as Mac, Indy's sidekick at the outset of the film, but then he morphs into somewhat of an enigma as to where his loyalties lie. He offers some of the robustness missed in Sallah's absence as well as providing some more overplayed scenes like Blanchett. In the department of old friends, Winstone is joined by John Hurt, as Professor Oxley, and Jim Broadbent, as Dean Charles Stanforth. John Hurt's role is much larger than Broadbent's as Oxley actually joins in the adventure although he is half crazed for the majority of the film muttering in a trance. It is overall a nice grouping making the film more of an ensemble piece than most of the previous Indiana Jones films, which are primarily Indiana Jones' show.This brings up things for circle to the main character played by stalwart Harrison Ford, Dr. Henry Jones Jr. Ford is as ever perfect in the role, but he is definitely showing his age in this film with the white hair and wrinkled skin and slower movement. Therefore, it appears more as if he is passing the torch to LaBeouf through much of the film, but never feeling quite certain about letting go of his cherished pastime of being shot up and beat up by the bad guys. Going on outrageous adventures and finding outlandish and supernatural artifacts. As such, it makes for an intriguing film, as it is not know until a good way through what is the relationship and where these characters are going to end up.The film is good old-fashioned adventure film in the vein of the previous films, but I sincerely hope this is the final film because there is a point to which you carry the legend and mythos of a character like Indiana Jones and this film carries a fine line with that legend. Even so, if you just do not want to over think the film and enjoy it with all its overblown action especially LaBeouf flying through the trees with the monkeys, you should enjoy a great thrilling adventure which is what was advertised. Although I did miss one other item, an outstanding new score to add to John Williams other memorable scores from the series including the Main Theme from Raider, The March of the Slave Children from the Temple of Doom, and the Scherzo for Motorcycle and Orchestra from the Last Crusade. I could not remember a great underlying score to this film other than the main theme motif played regularly throughout.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It drags on and except under the jungle chase it couldn't really hold my attention.Ford and the rest of the cast do a good job however.The script is what ruins this movie.They should probably have stuck with Darabont and the story about Noahs ark which Spielberg called ""the best scipt he has ever read"".

536,DirtyStarling,Plot could've been better,7,22 May 2008,"MOST DEFINITELY CONTAINS SPOILERS - The first three Indy movies are timeless classics and are on my personal top 100 greatest movies list.This movie, while good, could have been better. First I'll start with some positives...THE CHARACTERS --- I felt that the actors' portrayals of the characters in the film were well done. I was worried about Ford coming back to play Indy after so long, but I think he did it well. (A little weird at first, but you get used to it pretty quickly).THE DIALOGUE --- A personal worry I had about this film, but for the most part I felt that the dialog was good.THE ACTION SEQUENCES --- Well done with references to classic moments that made me smile (a big deal as I usually cringe when they do this).===================================================================== And now the negatives...THE PLOT/REASON FOR THE ADVENTURE --- C'MON!!! INTERDIMENSIONAL SPACE ALIENS!!! WTF?!!! When did Indiana Jones become about space aliens? The other three films dealt with religious mythology, and this one does to an extent, but... did it really have to be space aliens? It wouldn't have been so bad if the plot hadn't been used before, but it's been done. Stargate SG-1 did the Crystal Skull inter-dimensional space aliens already. Alien Vs. Predator did the space aliens giving ancestors technology and the Mayan pyramid that is actually a giant machine (Cringing throughout the ""they taught them irrigation"" scene). It would've been more interesting if it was less explanatory and more into actual mythology like the first three films. But space aliens? Ugh... Seen it. Didn't need to see Indy doing it. It's like they just watched Stargate and Alien Vs. Predator and said, ""Let's do that!!! But with Indiana Jones..."" Also had a little problem with Indy finding his long lost son... Kind of similar to Star Trek II with Kirk and David and a bunch of other films I don't feel like mentioning. This didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, but it's still a recycled plot that's been done with the ""Franchise returns after 20 years"" marketing scheme.THE ENDING --- F###ING SPACE ALIENS!!! I was hoping the ending would give a different explanation for the space aliens, especially after Indy's line in the tent about always having another explanation... but no. They are f###ing inter-dimensional space aliens. And a stereotypical UFO takes off at the end out of the Mayan pyramid. It's just... ridiculous. Not awful, but... ridiculous.Besides the f###ing space aliens, the deaths of the villains aren't that good. The lead villain's head bursts into flames as the stereotypical alien comes to life. I was hoping she would get an interesting new death, not a rehash of the first film done with CGI and faster, but no. The other villain deaths are not really interesting with the Russians and the Double-crosser being sucked into a white pool of death and a vortex of churning rubble respectively.=================================================================== There are other pros and cons I had with the film, but these are the big ones. Overall, it is a good action movie. The dialog isn't really cheesy... the acting's good, and the action sequences and special effects are good.The plot and ending were just disappointing just because it's all stuff which has been done before with the family coming together and the f###ing Mayan space aliens.As a result, the movie gets a 7 for being enjoyable, but with plot and ending problems.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
537,rynlarson,Nostalgia at its best!!!,9,22 May 2008,"So I just watched Indy 4: KOTCS....fantastic movie! I hear all the negative press and reviews...what is it that people expect? I was 1st introduced to Indy at age 5...my father and I ventured to the theater and saw Raiders and since then...I have been a huge fan and have awaited this return for a long time. As Julian Glover pronounced in ""Last Crusade""...its ""time to ask yourself what you believe...."" Indiana Jones is America's hero...his character is what every boy wants his father to be...so I went to see this Thursday morning with my father...and we loved it. Its 1957...Russians, disguised as U.S soldiers have made there way to New Mexico to have Indy recover an ""Area 51"" crate filled with a corpse...I won't tell you who or what. The Ark makes a cameo and from there the film takes off into the usual Indy formula including a fantastic motorcycle chase and a scene through the jungle that equals the truck chase scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Some critics have panned this film for being over the top...what Indiana Jones film hasn't been? Thats what these films are about...how is going over a gigantic waterfall any different than a giant boulder chasing Indiana Jones or swimming to a submarine and riding it to an uncharted island any different? How is Indiana Jones hiding in a lead lined refrigerator from a nuclear blast any different than the Ark of the Covenant shooting rays of light through Nazis? This is what the franchise was built on but somehow people have evolved from loving that to criticizing this...ridiculous. Lucas and Spielberg give Indy fans what they have been waiting for...one last thrill ride from the man in the Fedora. Great sets, great effects, Harrison Ford is fantastic and Karen Allen makes a welcome return as Marion Ravenwood/Williams/you will have to see the end of the movie.

539,pax03,fair indiana jones.,6,24 May 2008,"the weakest of the indiana jones movies clearly. i just think they missed on this one, i would think after 18-19 years from the last one that they would go all out and put together the ultimate indiana jones movie, they sure hyped it up to be but it didn't make it. the good thing is that all the indiana jones stuff you are used to is here and adds to the movie, the action scenes are great, multiple things are going on in these scenes and makes you appreciate that type of adventure film. the bad thing and the thing that annoys me about this is the whole thing just comes off alittle dull from my expectations (except for the action scenes.) the acting is good enough, the special FX are alright, the script is OK, the direction is good. All in all an entertaining film that had some decent spots but clearly in my book the 4th and least enjoyable indy film and that's a shame. because i wanted this movie to be awesome but it just came up short.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
540,SebaZava,Really great movie,9,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an amazing movie. Obviously, it is impossible for any movie to reach the masterfulness of Raiders, but when I went to see this flick, I wasn't expecting that. I was expecting was a fun and interesting film full of action sequences, thrills, spooky scenes, great characters, and a couple of special effects. And that's exactly what Crystal Skull has delivered. Although it isn't as fresh as, say, Iron Man, it definitely is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen this year.The film starts in Nevada, in 1957. Indy (Harrison Ford, of course) and his new(ish) sidekick/rival, ""Mac"" (Ray Winstone), have been captured by agents of the Soviet Union, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). She takes them to a military warehouse where every government secret is stored. (This is the same warehouse that appeared at the end of Raiders.) There's something she wants Indy to find and, after he does, he manages to escape. After being told by Dean Stanforth (Jim Broadbent) that he's being given a leave of absence, his attention is called by a young greaser called ""Mutt"" Williams (Shia LaBeouf). He wants his help to find Professor Oxley (John Hurt), who has been kidnapped by Russians while looking for a Lost City of Gold, in the South American Jungle; he seems to be involved in a hunt for the mythical Crystal Skulls.There is no other actor in the world that could play Indy and, even though Harrison Ford is already 65 years old, he plays Indiana the same as in the previous film. In short, he's excellent. It's also great to see the return of Karen Allen as Marion. She looks pretty much the same as she did in Raiders (except for the obvious differences that have to do with age), and boasts loads of chemistry with Ford.I must also say that all the hate that was directed towards Shia LaBeouf before the release of the movie was unfounded. Granted, he doesn't give an incredible performance, but he's really good in his role of greaser Mutt. Ray Winstone as Mac and John Hurt as Oxley are great too, but have too little screen time and aren't allowed enough time to shine. The real scene-stealer, though, is Cate Blanchett as Agent Irina Spalko. She might not be as charismatic or memorable as Raiders' Belloq, but she's nevertheless one of the best Indy villains yet.In terms of action, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull delivers. Spielberg manages to create many memorable action scenes that made me really excited. The Warehouse action sequence makes the movie start with a bang; the Marshall College chase, which has Indy and Mutt in a motorcycle being chased by Commies and ends in a library, is tons of fun; the Jungle Chase, which is the centerpiece of the whole film, is deliciously choreographed and shot. It has everything: shooting, explosions, bazookas, hybrid vehicles, fencing (yes, fencing!) and lots of thrills. It's one of the most exciting sequences in the whole movie, but it isn't perfect: the ""mini-scene"" of Mutt encountering a group of monkeys and doing like Tarzan is just too cheesy, and looks too obviously blue-screened. Fortunately, it doesn't last long and doesn't manage to do any damage to the movie.Yes, I said blue-screened. When Spielberg said that the film's special effects were only like 30% CGI, he was telling the truth kinda. The first 2/3 of the flick have almost no CGI; all the action sequences are shot in the old-fashioned way, with traditional real-life explosions and real stunt doubles and Russian extras. But it's when the movie arrives at its conclusion that the digital effects are let loose. When Spielberg said that only 30% of the effects were digital, I thought they were scattered around, but the reality is, most of them actually appear during the film's conclusion. That doesn't mean the movie doesn't feel like an Indy flick; I was just expecting an ending with less effects. The great news is that these computer effects aren't used for action sequences or stuff like that; they're actually needed, and never call attention to themselves. Besides, they look really cool and expensive.But why is CGI needed? Why didn't Spielberg use 100% practical effects? Well, I must say that the rumors regarding aliens were actually true, and that that's the reason why CGI was needed. No need to worry, though; we don't have little green men or stuff like that here. Let's just say that Spielberg and his team have followed the theory that says that the Crystal Skulls are of alien origin. The great thing is that Spielberg and Koepp (yes, Koepp too) make all of this credible and exciting, and if you watch Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as an homage to cheesy sci-fi movies of the 50s (as the previous flicks were an homage to the serials of the 30s), you'll have one hell of a time. It also helps that some scenes take place in Peru. The filmmakers got most of the details of Peruvian history right, and it's really cool to see the Nazca lines making an appearance.I really liked Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I just don't understand the critics who haven't liked the movie; it might not be a masterpiece (the Tarzan scene is ridiculous and special effects are sometimes too evident), but it's really fun. Maybe they have seen so many modern action movies full of digital effects, shaky camera-work and MTV-like editing, that they can't enjoy a traditional and seemingly-old-fashioned actioner. One just can't over-analyze this picture. The Indy films were created to provide with exhilarating action sequences, interesting and cheesy (yes, cheesy) story lines and great acting. So you know what? That's exactly what Indy IV delivers. Indy, we've missed you, and couldn't have chosen a better way to return. Welcome back.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
541,FMACDONALD,Better Than All 3 Of The New Star Wars Films,7,2 June 2008,"There's an old saying, ""Be Careful What You Wish For, It Just Might Come True"". Never did that statement ring more true for me, than in May of 1999 when a movie titled Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, hit theaters. I left the theater scratching my head, wondering did I just see a Star Wars movie? Three years later came the even worse Episode II: Attack Of The Clones. It wasn't till 2005 when George Lucas rekindled my faith in the series when he gave us Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith. I left the theater with an ear to ear grin on my face. Twenty years have passed since we last saw Lucas's (and Spielberg's) other creation Indiana Jones on the silver screen, and now along comes the fourth installment in the series, Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. So the question remains, is it twenty years too late? Well.....Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is damn entertaining, and a hell of a lot better than all three of the new Star Wars films are, but that doesn't mean it is without issues.The Year is 1957 (Raiders, Temple Of Doom, and Last Crusade all took place in the 1930's) Doctor Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. is now Col. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. (he apparently joined the service and helped take out those Nazi's he hated so much). Indy is older and wiser much like his father, Henry Sr. was in The Last Crusade (played brilliantly by Sean Connery). Exit the Nazi's and enter the Russian's (the cold war has begun). The Russians have ordered Indy to help them find a crystal skull that grants people psychic powers or they will kill him. Of course Indy has no intention of complying and he's off to the races to see who can get to the skull first.Now the plot sounds like a typical Indy flick, but trust me it's not. Instead of Indy running into traps and chasing after artifacts, *************MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD***************************** Indy is chasing after aliens. Yes you have read right aliens. George Lucas has found a way to mix Indy and Star Wars together. Now normally I wouldn't mind this, if say Lucas and Spielberg decided to make a Indiana Jones type flick and have aliens, but not have the actual Indiana Jones chasing after them. They basically turned Indy into Han Solo (He even says ""I got a bad feeling about this"") and that's what I was a little disappointed with.That being said, Unlike The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones, Crystal Skull does feel like an Indiana Jones movie all around. The action never stops, the humor is there when it needs to be, and it throws some bones to the fans (yes you see the ark of the covenant)and you can tell that Harrison Ford felt right at home throwing back on the old jacket and hat, and it's nice to see Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) again. Mutt Williams (Shia Labouf) is not nearly as annoying as everyone made him out to be, but there is an extreme ""oh come on moment"" that had me shaking my head.Over all Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull reminded me a lot of Temple Of Doom, and that's not a bad thing. On a scale of 10 I give Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull a 7.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
542,chi-cerca-trova,The Glory of Cinema,8,24 May 2008,"Being only 21, I cannot say that I remember Indiana Jones as well as someone who saw them in theaters. But I can say that Indiana Jones is one of those reasons that I love cinema. And for the numerous faults in the movie, I must say that I would still put this movie on par with Temple of Doom (Note: Temple of Doom is excellent, but not the best out of the three) Let us start with the bad. CGI does play a huge role in this movie, for better or for worse. The ending sequences are obvious, as are points in the central chase scene. While it can detract from the experience, I'll defend it in the end. The ending is not on par with the other Indiana Jones, and it has been a sticking point for many people I have talked to.As for the good. The CGI is a required evil. If you really take a look at the movie, you begin to realize that the CGI is not as prevalent as it is in the modern movie. However, you can tell when the filmmakers were able to make the set look good and realistic while still building sets, they would. Key scenes for this: The look over of the graveyard was an actual miniature, and the tomb that they find the mummies in were actually dressed by a prop master. The ending was not what I wanted, which I will whole heartedly agree was hokey, even by Indiana Jones standards. But, I'm willing to forgive it.In the end, this is by far not a perfect movie. But, Spielberg and Lucas were smart to not and try to recreate the feel of the original three, rather they allowed the movie to form it's own feel and pacing. And while I cannot say for certain that this movie will do the same for everyone as it did for me. But, it kept me smiling from ear to ear both times I saw it, and that is what Indiana Jones is all about, at least to me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
543,stefanbe,Indiana Jones is back and he can still pack a punch.,8,28 May 2008,"The Indiana Jones films have always been about fun, danger and low-budget epic-ness. Nineteen years after The Last Crusade, Harrison Ford has once again donned the fedora and while he is able to afford a senior discount this time around, he can still pack a punch. Along with Ford, director Steven Spielberg, executive producer George Lucas and composer John Williams also return. And while The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't the masterwork that Raiders of the Lost Ark is, it's still an entertaining time at the cinema.The Indiana Jones flicks have always been known as much for their performances as it has for its action scenes. Harrison Ford slips back into the fedora and leather jacket comfortably, though he is now older and wiser. Along with Han Solo and Rick Deckard, Indiana Jones is his most iconic character and he plays him with the same amount of rough-ness as he did in the 1980's. Returning for the first time since Raiders of the Lost Ark is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, proving even further that of all the love interests in the other films, she is the only one who comes close to matching whits with Indy (as shown when he tells her ""they all had the same problem, they weren't you""). The addition of rising star Shia La Beouf as greaser Mutt Williams is a smart one. He gives a great performance, keeping down-to-earth and not going over-the-top, delivering his lines well. He also makes what could have been an annoying character very likable. The stand-out of the film is Cate Blanchett, who puts on a faux Russian accent for her role as the evil Communist agent who is also pursuing the Crystal Skull in the title. She helps make the villain an evil one would not want to cross with. The only character who doesn't fit is Sam Winstone's Mac, who just feels like an unnecessary way to give him a sidekick more his age.In regards to action, Steven Spielberg's direction in those scenes is the usual great work he's been delivering since Duel way back in 1971. The final hour is especially exciting, with half of it consisting of a car chase through the Amazon, ending in the most lethal ants ever seen on screen. Despite some geographical mistakes, it's hard not to be on the edge of the seat, while watching it. The classic Ben Burtt sound effects are also in place to make these sequences even more worthy of being in an Indiana Jones film. The score by John Williams is also perfect as usual, from the timeless ""Raiders March"" to the new themes written for this film, it shows that he is still the master of film scores.In area of special effects, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is hit-or-miss. The film has more computer-generated effects than an Indiana Jones film should have and Spielberg's idea to use CG prairie dogs instead of real ones is an odd choice. However, when it comes to practical model effects, the film delivers and the matte painting background also work well in having that old-time style. The film's homage to 1950's science-fiction films also add some fun to the proceedings and despite the idea of aliens in an Indiana Jones film seeming odd, it works.Overall, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull stands with Speed Racer as the most entertaining film of the year, showing that you can't put an old hero down and that an 80's action star can work in the 21st century. With both John McClane and Indiana Jones returning with flying colours, all that's left now are the Ghostbusters.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
544,TheXeroXone,"Not the strongest chapter, but not bad",7,22 October 2008,"I don't see why so many people hated this film.First of all, Harrison Ford simply isn't as young as he used to be and as such he couldn't do all the great action work he used to. Even if they had grafted pecs onto his body like they did with Ricardo Montalban in Wrath of Khan, he still wouldn't be able to get into as many on-camera fight scenes.Secondly, it may have favored super-scientific ideas over the mystical nature of the previous films, but it was still fantastic enough and it dealt with the true nature of his character, the archaeologist.Third, people claim this film uses too much CGI. Usually these are the same people who complain if anything more elaborate than a sock puppet is used as a special effect in a film. So what? The effects in this film still looked better than most of the effects in the previous films - including the Last Crusade.This is a good final chapter to the series. It could have been done 12 years earlier and been more entertaining and they wouldn't have needed Indy's young sidekick to fill in for the action sequences, but its still worth the price of a matinée.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
545,whatever_123,Heartbreaking,2,27 October 2009,"Being only fifteen, I haven't seen the old movies in the theaters, but I did watch them and loved them. When word got out that there was a fourth one coming out, I was thrilled. Another Indy adventure? YAY!!!! All that excitement and counting down the days... for nothing. This movie disappoints from the beginning. It's not because of Harrison Ford's aged appearance (he can't help that), its because of the drugged, ten year old writers who were hired for the movie. They probably had no idea about what it was that made Indiana Jones so great, and it shows throughout the whole movie.First of all, Shia LeBeuf added nothing special to the movie, I think he was hired for the movie to attract more people to see it. His character was very shallow and was a totally pointless addition to the movie.Second of all, why were the bad guys Russians? What did they want? What were their motives? And do we get those answers? NO.Third, The plot. It was, frankly, terrible. It was confusing and it winded all over the place. I couldn't tell What Indy was trying to find or why he was trying to prevent the evil Russian lady from finding whatever the heck he was trying to find. I didn't understand the crystal skull. What was it for??? Fourth, the ending. This was the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie. May I remind you that this is an adventure movie, not a sci fi movie. If that's true, then why did the movie conclude with the rising of a UFO out of the ground??? There was also that whole scene where the Russian lady was in that spinning room asking the aliens to teach her everything, when soon her eyes catch fire and she basically disintegrates. What was that all about??!!! How could Speilburg and GEORGE LUCAS, for goodness sake, approve this movie? Both being movie making geniuses, how could they allow this to appear in the theaters? It was a complete mess!! I'm positive that every Indiana Jones fan's heart is broken. I don't blame them.

546,danielloe,"Entertaining, but gets too ridiculous",4,9 June 2015,"*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the fourth installment of the Indiana Jones saga, and probably not the last. This movie gets way too much hate, and I think that's because people are drawing unfair comparisons to the original three which were in- arguably better. Some of the style and fun was lost of the original three, and the alien sub-plot was too cheesy, but those are pretty much my only complaints. I know the action scenes are really over- the-top, but so was the action in the first three, so I won't hold it against 'Kingdom'. I think the cast is pretty good, bringing back Marion was a good touch, and I like Shia Lebouf as Indy's son (I know people don't like Lebouf, but I can't help but enjoy his character in this movie). Harrison Ford is a little too old to be playing Indy anymore, but he does a decent job with it, but his age definitely puts limitations on the action. The best segment for me is when they go to raid the tombs, that was the closest to the original Indiana Jones style. Action, humor, traps, artifacts, stuff like that. In conclusion, no I don't think its fair to give this movie so much hate, it certainly isn't perfect, or as good as the first three, but it is still an entertaining movie. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an alright movie with a good cast, some good humor, a weak plot, and some over-the-top action (that can be counted as a positive or a negative depending on how you feel about over-the-top action).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Because Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull opened today as well, that's why.I've been looking forward to this film every since I heard about it, and I was not disappointed. Lucas and Spielberg can make a decent adventure when they put their talents to it. I made sure to sit somewhere surrounded by kids who had the day off from school. They loved it, even if they didn't get all the ""in jokes"" in the film.The action takes place in 1957 (I think, since it's 10 years after Roswell) which I liked since I was born that year. The action takes place about 20 years after the original film, which seems to match the passage in real time since the last film.I loved the weaving of history, myth and fantasy in this film, which matches the previous three quite well (and also the references to earlier films that are key to the plot). It has plenty of ""knees up, running around"" type action and enough stunts and spectaculars to make it visually appealing (especially the denouement).Will there be a final 5th film?

RAMBO) and now Indiana Jones 4 (a.k.a Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls).It comes without say, that Indiana Jones 4 was the one of these 4 re-tread movies I had the highest expectations for, and Rambo 4 was the one that I had the least expectations for. - And Boy did I ever get it backwards.Rambo 4 was an action packed no holds barred thrill ride, with a great story. Full of Brutal action, great plot, all too realist battles scenes, and believable realistic characters.Harrison Ford wasn't as lucky as Sylvester Stallone, despite the fact that he had Steven Spielberg and George Lucas both in his corner and pulling all of the strings. Indiana Jones 4 was awful. I loved the original 3 movies with a passion and consider them among the greatest movies of all time. How could the dream team of Speilber, Lucas and Ford make a Indiana Jones movie that was actually bad. It doesn't seem fathomable - but they did.In this re-tread. Indy has a son who is a Fonzy wanna be(from Happy Days)...I was willing to except some silliness. I was excepted the Russians breaking into Area 51, and then Indy survives a Nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge. - Okay, I am willing to except that... But then this movie went into over the top in silly. Such as Indy's son and the villain sword fighting while standing on the hoods of moving cars, unbelievable acrobatics (the kind we saw in movies like MATRIX and Blade), then he got knocked off of the car, then he swang on vines like Tarzan until he caught up to the cars, then an army of Brazilian rain Forrest monkeys magically attack the Russians.... was this really written by adults. Then the grand finale of the film was the ancient Aztech pyramid that amazingly folds up into an alien flying saucer, then a magic earthquake comes and floods out the entire area, which Indy and his cohorts survive because the magical end up on top of a mountain after leaving the pyramid. >>> this movie was all about stunts, special effects without any relevance for reality.Indiana Jones 4 is not totally awful, its just silly -",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Too bad her contrived Russian accent sounded more like Natasha of Rocky and Bullwinkle fame. Good news - 57 year old Karen Allen's character of Marion Ravenwood looked pretty good after a 27 year hiatus. Unfortunately, Spielburg preferred goofiness over feistiness. Good news - Shia LaBeouf as Indy, Jr. Too bad he had little to work with. From the senseless slaughter and atomic bombing in the opening scenes to the ""gag me"" wedding ending, I was confused, bored, and disappointed.

Like most people who have been biting their nails in anticipation for this, I grew up with the Indiana Jones movies. I was only 5 when The Last Crusade came out, a little young to fully appreciate them but by the time I was old enough to really care they became one of if not my number one favorite series of all time. You would think that that kind of ranking would make any attempt at new film pretty hard to live up, but the team is back and they pulled it off big time.The reason I was so quickly taken away by this adventure? Simple. I, unlike so many people voicing their opinions on message boards and comment boxes know how to escape in a movie. All you do is watch, you don't enter the theater with a preconceived notion of what you're gonna watch, with a mental note pad combing every frame to find fault. You don't raise a fuss about how much a movie is gonna suck before you've even seen it. You sit back and you watch. That's what you did when you when you were a kid, that's why those movies you grew up with have such a godlike sense in the back of your head. Just Watch.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull opens with the same scratchy and jittery 1980's version of the Paramount logo that all the other's did, then cross dissolves to prairie dog mound just as the mountains, gongs and rocks did in all the others. It was at that moment that I knew nobody involved had forgotten what they were working on. I was so impressed with the film that I would find it damn near criminal to discuss plot points for giving away any of the surprises(with the exception of my final paragraph). There were in deed parts that couldn't help but be strongly foreshadowed from the trailers and natural fanboy speculation but short of bootlegging dailies from the shoot there's no way in hell you'd know how all those quick shots and moments of dialog were gonna fit together. If it's not already obvious. Go see this movie! It's got an 8.6 ranking here for a reason. I'm only writing this cuz it seems like the majority of the people who bothered to write anything here are the ones that hated it for petty and pretentious reasons. This is a movie for people who like movies, just like the 3 originals.****Spoiler Warning******* Now for my one and only comment on plot. There is only one reason that my rating fell short of a full ten and that would be the use of aliens in the story. I'm not going to comment on this the way you would likely expect. This one point I think is what have turned some of the films detractors off. I also think however that a lot of these people had their minds made up as soon as they heard even the slightest hint that there might be an alien connection, the same people that feel the urge to bring up Jar Jar Binks when speaking of this movie just because they have a grudge against Lucas. Aliens are no more far fetched than melting faces, voodoo dolls, 500 year old knights or magic cups and rocks. The only problem here is that it dips its toe a little deeper into Science Fiction than I may have liked to see in an Indiana Jones film. I think this could have been avoided though, simply by not showing the fleshed out aliens and their space ship, no matter how brief. I think they actually fit into the plot quite nicely and as this movie is set in the 1950's it was appropriate to utilize a paranoia that had only just begun to take the world, I just think their literal involvement would been left better unsaid, it was implied well enough long before we saw any visual proof. That's my 2 cents anyway. Still not enough to kill the movie for me though.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
551,The_Matrix_Rocks,Misses It's Mark By A Mile,4,24 November 2008,"I felt pretty bad for Harrison Ford throughout this movie because he looked decidedly out of place for a man acting in a movie franchise that was built up around him.It's as if deep in the recesses of his own artistic consciousness, he knew that the idea of a fourth outing so many years later as the titular Indiana Jones was ill-conceived.But the financial inducement must have been good, and ""Firewall"" was after all, quite a lot of house-and-car re-payments ago. So at some level, perhaps he had no choice but to plod along. And plod he does.Assuming the heyday of these movies passed about 20 years ago, Spielberg needs to remember what George Lucas learnt with his Star Wars projects - it's OK to re-package an old product, but don't try to sell it to the same audience. Kids today won't respond to Indy in the way we responded when we were growing up - even with the relentless merchandising.This movie would offer an intriguing exam poser for Film Studies students though: ""Is it still considered 'derivative' when you copy your own work?""Granted Spielberg almost had it though, laying some groundwork to introduce Shia LaBeouf as a new-age Indy. But his undoing lay in trying to re-birth an action hero fundamentally out of step with his target generation.And while Cate Blanchett was deliciously evil, I have to say Karen Allen's performance is pure fodder for an ""E!

First, Harry should have made this movie the first time they asked him when he was 51ish....the script was trite, the scenes were predictable, the accent by Cate was well, what can I say, I didn't believe she was Russian! and with Mutt/Shia in it, will he carry on the Jones name? well I hope they don't insult the audience again with some lights and dramatic car chase scene and unbelievable sword fights. When we were first introduced to Indy, we were in awe of the scenery, the script, the continuity, the action scenes, the escapes, every scene having a purpose (or is that editing?) and the characters well developed....but this was one just plain dumb and I couldn't wait for it to end. The theatre, although it was playing in about 10 auditoriums, ours only had only a cup full of customers, that is very key the day after an opening! BUT what can I say, the good thing about being a good director and producer of the past (Spielberg and Lucas), is that even before someone goes to the movie, they have made up their minds they will go and therefore these two continue to get more rich!!! Not many will ask for a refund, they will do like many of us here, go and then complain, as the pen has always been mightier than the sword!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
553,HuskyEnzo,Raiders Of The Lost Art,2,16 June 2008,"When the excellent (!) The Mummy"" was released and friends asked me how good it was, I always replied: Better than Tomb Raider"" but of course can't compete with Indy3."" Within that grid one must sort Indy 4"" on one step with Tom Raider"" now! Many people I know, consider ""Temple"" the worst of the series. I never agreed because even though it wasn't as excellent as ""Ark/Crusade"", it was still terrific!This one is far, far ... farfarfarfarfarfarfar worse than ""Temple""! Bottom line.""Crystal-Skull"" is the continuation of ""Van Helsing"" by ... well, unfortunately by the same means. The jungle race and the sequence along the cliff was identically in ""VH"" and sucked already there. They should have avoided CGI! It's the Dark Side of adventure-movies. And even though there was lots of it in ""The Mummy"", it's makers accomplished it better to integrate and sublime it to the story and characters. What made ""The Mummy"" as well as the other ""Indy""-films better than this was also scenes when the heroes fail or get caught in a mess and their facial expressions then. To shoot straight: the dumb look on their faces! They have spared that too here. Now ""our"" heroes can do everything! Booooring *ZAPP*.It's the same problem as the leap between Carpenter's ""Escape from...""-films: Snake Plissken is a nihilistic streetfighter in ""NY"" and all of a sudden an omnipotent Superman in ""LA"" which spoiled the character and the spirit of the film.Some dialogues and conceivable funny scenes in ""Skull"" like the quicksand-confession- simply weren't comic but clumsy. The spirit of the first three movies went gone. I remember after ""Crusade"" I've read an interview with Steven were he told about and praised his crew, specifically his chief-editor. Spielberg said, he always asked his editor something like ""How many panels? What cutrate do you use?"", and that old chap always replied: ""I don't know, it just FEELS right!"" Sorry I can't recall the source, but I definitively read it like that. Here's the dilemma: ""Skull"" doesn't FEEL right! In another note before the release of ""Phantom Menace"", Spielberg claimed he already got a private screening in Lucas' homecinema and ""...it was so good that I will avoid to compete with that for quite a while..."". It's plain obvious that both fellas would better consult fan-advice before their next eventual sequels.It's not understandable why and how Spielberg, who even mastered to emotionalize issues like WWII without getting pathetic or euphemistic, but therefor highly emphatic, could now fail about that in a ""simple"" adventureflick after doing it right at least two times before with that franchise.In fact the best scene is the one with the Marcus Brody statue, which reprises the father-son-eye-contact-take from Crusade"" during the motorcycle-chase. Also the following library-exit-dialog from Indy which refers to his study-advise from Crusade"" was the best reference.It's also quaint -but actually could have been predicted- that the attempt to introduce an extraterrestrial background couldn't be accomplished as credible as even the spiritual ones from all earlier flicks. Actually not credible at all. Besides, it's only attractive for X-Files""-fans who understand all the Area51"" references too. And for those -my former roommate is one of those- it's just amateur-stuff.Another odd thing is, that the idol looks crappy. Even the ""Sankara""-stones were more impressive even though there wasn't'anything spectacular about them. So were the sets. The graveyard was a studio, right? They'd better found a real one. Everybody who loved the first movies just KNOWS that this is studio.And the freezer-scene... aw, c'mon! It left me cold, to cone a phrase.The good point is, that now they have to do a fourth part - right now! They can't shelf the franchise like that! Little advise to Steven and George: ""The Amber-Room"" and ""Odessa""; let's fight some Nazis again.

554,predator_silver77,Indiana Jones and the attack of the Crazy Monkies!,5,16 December 2008,"Plot: Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is back for more adventure. Being captured into helping the Soviet's find a artifact that will lead them to a hidden alien inspired kingdom. With the help of a young kid named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) and a old girl friend (Karen Allen). Action is sure to ensue.My Spiel: This movie was at times very slow, and I truly wanted to be amazed like I was with the very first Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark. But what do you expect with a lead actor that's older then my dad trying to do stunts at a action/adventure type level, but gave a valiant effort. But I enjoyed only the little things in this movie. I was just trying to stay entertained, but really couldn't get into it as much as I wanted. Granted this movie is fun, and can be watched again. There were times I was like its getting better, and then something ridicules would happen, from the Mutt and monkey part (if you have seen the movie you know what I'm talking about). I 'm not trying to spot all the movie flaws but that was just crazy. This movie just lacked that huge wow factor I was looking for. Granted it was cool to see the reference to the Ark in the warehouse. Most of the story was very predictable I knew the end, and also how Indy was basically going to escape from everything. I know I am ripping into this movie, but like I said I only like the little things from some of the witty bad boy acting of Mutt, and the reactions of Indy from time to time, but not always. But what was nice was to see Karen Allen back again, surly they were trying to duplicate the success of the First film but fell short.End Result: Let me just say this movie racked in 800 million dollars world wide in box office showing, ""That is Insane"" Considering this is obviously the worst of the 4 films.

555,MattDevivre,Not as weak as it could be - but far away from being as good as it should be !,5,16 June 2008,"As huge Indy fan I - like many others - was curious about this fourth installation of Indiana Jones. Curious and worried. It's safe to say that Indy is one of the most successful fictional characters ever created for cinema. Back then George Lucas had excellent ideas. Without him there would be no Skywalker, no Yoda... and no Indiana Jones. But the new ""Star Wars"" episodes have shown one thing: he lacks ideas and what he needed to tell he had told long ago. What's left for now feels to me more like a bunch of self-references and the same seems true for ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". This Spielberg-Lucas co-production disappointed me for several reasons: first of all Indy had always been about very archetypal and religious stories and mostly about the Nazis. In comparison ""Crystal Skull"" chose an atypical way. Yes, I do understand that for Indy has aged significantly and therefore his opponents have changed... but why Aliens ? Aliens are a topic close to conspiracy theories. It doesn't feel ancient and historical or adventurous at all.The next thing is that the action is too uncreative while there's too little story. After all it's hard to become acquainted to any of the characters. Indy had always had fascinating bad guys... not this time. It might be the weakest performance Cate Blanchett so far, probably also due to the screenplay which doesn't leave much space for each characte. I think that writer Koepp can do better.Conclusion: I could name further more critics but those were the main reasons, why ""Crystal Skull"" isn't as good as any piece of the old trilogy - though it may seem close to the second (weakest) one. It doesn't have the fascination ""Raiders"" or ""Crusade"" has !",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
556,Jack_Acid,"Minimal nostalgic value, not up to snuff for the modern movie-goer",5,26 May 2008,"An excerpt from my comment on Pirates: Dead Man's Chest applies flawlessly here: ""It suffers from all the pitfalls you fear going into a sequel...bloated budget, very little growth from the main characters, overly-complicated plot, countless unnecessary scenes of which very few carry any sort of punch, etc."" It's clear from the outset that Lucas and Spielberg were zeroed in on the punchy, pulp fiction action that Indy was first conceived, vs. catering to a more modern, movie-going audience. If you go into it expecting a freshly scripted, character-enriching experience, you'll likely be disappointed. If you're looking for a nostalgic popcorn-popper, chances are you'll be satisfied.Many will cry foul over the film's plot being related to aliens. That was the center of pulp fiction in the 50s and clearly that was important to the writers here. I can't argue with the creators in terms of their subject matter, but I will say this: the alien theme, while I understand its origins in the mind of the filmmakers, was a big and VERY NEEDLESS jump in the genre. It reminded me of what a new writer does to a previously existing successful series in any medium, such as a TV show, or comic book. They've got hundreds, if not thousands, of mythologies to choose from and they settle on...campy, American pop culture? A really risky premise and unfortunately, a theme that Lucas insisted on. But hey! It's Lucas' baby, we need to accept the premise to move on, which bring me to frankly, the biggest and most glaring problem....the STORY/SCRIPT/PLOT.Detailed points: 1. The entire Area 51 sequence: TOTALLY UNNECESSARY. The story could easily have started from the university. Mutt could have been introduced with a lot more care and in such a way I cared when it happened. We could have learned a LOT more about their chemistry and relationship instead of wasting time at Area 51. The same goes for the nuclear testing scene - 100% UN-NEEDED.2. CARTOONISH VILLAIN and SUPPORTING CHARACTERS - Spalko, played by the very talented and capable Cate Blanchett, is easily the weakest villain in any IJ film to date, being outmatched by not only predecessors, but previous SUB-villains. Case in point - I was more loathsome of the antics of the Nazi general from Crusades, or the slimy Toht of Raiders than Spalko. We never see her worst deeds. Why should we hate her? I knew why I wanted to see previous villains fail, but not so here. More squandered talent in Jonh Hurt and Ray Winstone - their characters were also two-dimensional and forgettable. Again, these issues are a symptom of a bad script.3. TONS OF PLOT EXPOSITION USING DIALOGUE instead of imagery, actions or scenes. Are you kidding me? This is SPIELBERG. This is LUCAS. And yet they STILL fall into this amateur trap that's preached in Film-making 101? This was the majority of my problem following the details of the story, because it was fed to me through laborious blocks of dialogue. I honestly can't recall how scenes were linked together...there's no ""dots"" for me to follow having just watched it.4. ASPECTS OF LOVE. Maybe it's just me, but the way that Marion was re-introduced and the whole ""family"" dynamic were really flat. Marion seemed more like a token shoe-in than the fiery character we knew and grew to love in Raiders. Another NEEDLESS character. This only made the wedding scene a bigger question mark and awkward. There was NO buildup to that outcome and frankly, the idea of getting married doesn't fir either character AT ALL. They make better adventure buddies that have spurs of passion for one another, but know it would never work between them. THAT is the Indiana and Marion we know and love.... pragmatic and stubborn. No where to be found here.5. FLAT ENDING. By the end of this film, I need to understand INDIANA JONES better. Just like I did at the end of Temple of Doom. Just like I did at the end of Last Crusade. But here? I knew nothing more about him. No new leaf turned. Just kind of going through the motions of what the filmmakers THINK we need to see of him. And even in THAT respect, the scripts fails - little use of the whip, a pistol or even most glaring yet....His WITS! Pay attention....this film included NO part of Indy using his ingenuity or outwitting the bad guys when his back was against the wall. I found myself out-thinking the film. That should never happen.Then there's all the more petty complaints that people have that many I agree with, but were not the most damaging, such as the nuclear testing sequence, the Tarzan and Brando homages, etc. These were somewhat tacky elements, but FORGIVABLE if the story/plot/script is any good at all, which unfortunately and almost inconceivably, is not true here.I think the reality is, this is a franchise that is not meant for modern thinking movie goers. The suspension of disbelief is harder to come by. That isn't to take anything away from Indiana Jones, it's just a simple observation that timing is almost just as critical as subject matter in the formula for success. But it's also glaringly apparent that Lucas is totally out of touch with movie goers and his audience. I really wish that when he considered reviving the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, he realized that such beloved treasures as those had NOTHING to gain, yet EVERYTHING to lose. Crystal Skull is, unfortunately, another unnecessary black mark on Lucas' legacy, not unlike Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones.Despite my disappointment and long-winded criticisms, many will enjoy this film for what it is. Still, one can't help but be befuddled that after 19 years, this is best the Lucas and Spielberg could come up with.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
557,MisterMxyzptlk,Die Dr. Jones!,1,31 August 2010,"Holy shatfest was this thing bad. Lucas has taken the same formula he used in the prequels to his infamous meal ticket and planted the same seed into this abomination. That is to say, he has stripped the characters, convoluted the storyline, exaggerated the action sequences and pretty much plundered any remaining component that made the first three films memorable. Then there is old Spielberg, who took the dog turd of a script and managed to create action sequences that were long, uninspired and basically a disaster to wrap ones head around. This was by far one of the worst films I have seen in ages and the entire crew and cast should be taken to a field, tied up and shot.

559,atliel,I really wanted to like this,4,14 June 2008,"I really wanted to like this even after I was warned that of the four films this one was the weakest. The way I see it is if I show up to a theater with low expectations there's probably a chance I might enjoy it more than I would had I hyped it to death. But man was I wrong. The film starts off strong with a great first act (some hokey moments involving a family of gophers but forgivable none the less)displaying the trademark Indiana Jones action we've come to expect from top caliber film-makers like Spielberg. After a half hour or so the movie just goes down hill. Maybe it was the introduction of Le Bouf as a clichéd 50's biker a la Marlon Brando or bringing in Karen Allen as she takes away more than what she adds. She simply looks pasted onto the actual celluloid as a gimmick for the fans than serving a purpose for the story. Regardless by the time you're within the second act everything becomes a weird blur containing bad green screen effects, a Tarzan tribute?...I think, and an army of large red army ants who apparently like feasting on human flesh. What do they eat when there aren't people around? But if that's not bad enough wait till you get to the third act where it all ends in hardcore fantasy. A bad Lucas nightmare come to life. The odd thing is I still don't think the film sucks. The script absolutely sucks but the quality of the other filmmakers/actors output is evident as it saves the film from being absolute garbage. Put it this way, if you're a fan you'll probably be disappointed and if you're unfamiliar with Indiana Jones you may walk away wondering what the hell you just saw. That may just as well be the way to go to see this film as you might enjoy it more than if you knew how great it all once was with Raiders.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I just feel strongly for the film because of many reasons, one it's not a piece of garbage like everyone says it is, two the film has a lot of family entertainment in it a lot of good laughs just like the first film and the third film and three the score is outstanding by John Williams! So to finish off don't write it off just because there is a huge group of people who hate this film and no disrespect to the people who hate the film but they are wrong the film has sadly become one of the few Steven Spielberg films that is overlooked despite the fact it's part of the Indiana Jones series which is a shame, on the back of my DVD of the film there's a quote from a review which describes the film as a wonderful family comedy and I am inclined to agree with the reviewer who said that it's a wonderful piece of family entertainment don't listen to the haters of this film enjoy it for yourself I do I do not care about the haters of this wonderful family movie!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
561,ZookGuy,Filled With the Excitement of Getting A Candy Bar and the Crushing Disappointment When You Discover That the Chocolate's Melted,6,27 December 2008,"First off, let me just say that you should see it just to see Indy's return to the silver screen, but don't expect the wait was filling up the gas for the franchise to release another Raiders. The film is far, and I mean far, from the greatness of Raiders, but if you just stay in the moment and try to ignore all the flaws until the credits, you will have a fun time watching this, that is until you actually see the ending, which is the ultimate disappointment of any Indy fan.Let me point out the pros first: Indy's return to the big screen since the 80's (which gives you enough reason to Netflix it). Entertaining action sequences. A good performance from Ford. The cinematography is excellent (should be Oscar nominated, but not Oscar winner).Not the cons: Horrible performance by Shia LaBeouf (I probably spelt his name wrong), Spielberg giving his arguably 2nd worse directing ever (War or the worlds is a well deserved #1). Not a much humor as the past Indy movies. Hiding in fridge, the film tells us, can help you survive a nuclear blast, which I'm sorry, is horribly cheesy. Labeouf horribly trying to imitate Brando in the Wild One (black leather and all).And the biggest con: The worse ending of the decade: a UFO comes out of the temple (a UFO that is so cheesy cinema hasn't seen a UFO so cheesy since the 50's) and then the film ends.

562,mr_walsh,"Visually stunning, but left me unsatisfied",6,23 May 2008,"Without a doubt this movie is a joy to look at, particularly the scenes in the 50's college town. And there were some intriguing ideas in the plot. But in the end, movies are about people and their stories, and this movie neglects the 'people stuff'. Maybe the stunts were so fantastic that you stopped thinking of the people as human beings. I've got to say things like the groundhogs shattered the Indy genre to me. Or maybe the pacing during the action scenes was so rapid that it left no room for my own imagination to become invested. Or perhaps the basic goal of the story didn't work for me as it did so brilliantly in RotLA or IJatLC.All I can say is just as I walked out of 'Star Wars Episode I' basically un-entertained yet undeniably impressed with the technical achievements, I walked out of 'IJatKotCS' with my senses pleased but just not particularly entertained.I wouldn't say this is a terrible movie...but it certainly falls far short of being a classic like 'Raiders'.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
563,DrEbert,"Entertaining in that self-parodying sort of way, but somebody PLEASE tell George Lucas to retire!!",6,22 May 2008,"Usually, when you go to see an action/adventure movie, especially an Indiana Jones movie, you're going to suspend your disbelief and just allow yourself to ""get into"" the movie. These kinds of movies are supposed to be mindless escapist fun. Still, one might expect some small modicum of plausibility or connection to the real world. When it comes to ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" forget about suspending disbelief. Just pretend you're in another dimension altogether. If you do that, you'll have have met one of the two prerequisites for seeing this movie. (If you don't believe me now, you will when you see this film and see our hero survive a cataclysmic event in a fairly cartoonish manner a mere 15 minutes into the film.) The other prerequisite is that you've seen the other three movies...religiously. A huge chunk of the entertainment value of this film comes from nostalgia, in-jokes, and self-parody. It is an entertaining movie and I had fun and laughed while I was watching it and the reason for this is because we are either enjoying seeing all of the same old gags done once again in a bigger and cooler way, or we are enjoying seeing those gags mocked. Trusty bullwhip? Check. Fedora? Check. Long car chase with fighting and leaping and what-not? Check. Dark tombs lit only by torches? Check. Gross creepy crawly critters? Check.This is what makes the movie entertaining, but is also what prevents it from greatness and what makes me hesitant to call it a true ""Indiana Jones"" movie. George Lucas (who co-wrote the screenplay) has tried to do here what he did to the ""Star Wars"" prequels, namely that he thinks that appealing to the fan base with in-jokes, self-parody, and re-hashing the same old stuff can take the place of actually writing a a story that can stand on its own merits. The ""Star Wars"" prequels failed because Lucas could not get past his constant references to the original trilogy and so instead created fan fiction instead of true prequels. (Well, there was also the fact that Lucas' dialogue SUCKED.) Here, the stunts and action sequences and in-jokes keep us feeling entertained during the course of the film, but when we walk away, we wonder where was the real story.Indiana Jones is a homage to 1930s serials about treasure hunters. He's out of place in the 1950s. Also out of place are the Soviets(led by Cate Blanchett in a Rosa Kleb-like role). And there are many, many, MANY instances where you will get to wondering just how implausible the next stunt will be. All of that I can put up with, though, and in fact can and do add to the entertainment value of the film. What I could not put up with was the ending, which will remind you not of Indiana Jones but of the ending to another Spielberg movies that pre-dates ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" This movie is lots of fun to watch, but it doesn't take itself seriously and probably shouldn't be part of the Indiana Jones canon.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I had read other reviews but I like to keep an open mind. I loved ""Raiders"". There was a tangible presence that hooked you just enough to believe that it might be true yet you knew that it was only a movie. The Lost Ark of the Covenant and the power it could command. Diabolical enemies and a love interest in the very beautiful Karen Allen. I remember her from Starman... (sighs) Then there was a second film. Enough said.And then Sean Connery turned up as Indy's dad in ""Last Crusade"" - OMG, Brilliant! I loved it! More Nazis, including Gail Platt's gay dad Ted, from Corrie... More boy's own story with just a hint that it might be true.And they all looked as if they performed solid, honest, down-to-earth (with-a-bang) stunts.Then there was a fourth film.This is getting like a twisted version of the Star Trek films. Odd numbers bad, even numbers good, except for Indy, 1 & 3 are superb while 2 & 4 are not.Given Harrison Ford's age, I guess it had to be made in the 50's and that was when communism was the new threat. But Russians on American soil in 1957? Difficult to swallow. Indy's back story of his exploits during the war? Gulp! Cate's make up and costume? Cough! Then it simply descended into set CGI pieces. It went from the ridiculous to the incredulous. Jungle chase and fights? A bit Star Wars VI. No tender moments (remember Marion and Indy on the boat in Raiders and he aches all over except for his eyebrow?) Mutt getting hit between the legs by trees over and over again... Gag! What's with the gophers or prairie dogs? And change ants for scarab beetles to get a scene from The Mummy. Those ants aren't native to Peru. Choke!Neil Flynn. You are a janitor in the FBI. You played it comic when you could have played it menacing or deeply disturbing.There is so much wrong with this movie that it would take more than 1000 words to list them all. Regard this movie as a tacked on, non-canon bit of fan fiction.And there is the nod at the end to Shia LeBeouf picking up Indy's mantle as he holds Indy's iconic headgear. Nope. Leave it alone. Step away from the fedora...I don't know where they could have gone with a good Indy story. More religious artifacts? The staff of Moses with which he commanded the waters to part. It became a snake (mmm, Indy and a snake?).The real shroud of Turin, a plot by the Russians to seize all Christian relics and replace them with detailed forgeries then undermine Western religion by exposing them and casting doubt enhancing the appeal of communism - except Indy uncovers the plot...An artifact that proves the State of Israel was foretold and blessed by God... except the British are the bad guys as they are working with the Palestinians in early 1948... but the Jews are successful even without this artifact.There are some ideas for ""Indy V"". Just need fleshed out. But little CGI please and more use of the whip and close up action.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
565,worldpieceprod,"Starts off good, gets worse, then....really bad.",3,22 August 2008,"I've purposely waited to write a review on this film since I first saw it a few months ago. I figured Indy deserved a second viewing before I labeled this film as a turd. I will say that I left the theater after the first viewing angry and cheated. I felt like my childhood hero had been castrated before my eyes. The second viewing confirmed much of my previous anger, but I will say that the second round left me hating it a little less, just a little. The first twenty minutes of the film are the only redeemable parts worth seeing. In fact, I would suggest watching this film as a short. When the A-Bomb is ignited simply shut it off and walk away. You will be happier if you do. After the spectacular opening we are spoon fed scene after scene of a tired looking Indy spouting off terrible dialog to a surrounding wooden cast of empty suits. One bad CGI scene leads to the next one, only to get progressively worse, much like the pointless plot. In between the action we are given overlong segments of dialog that explain some stupid story that nobody cares about. Then they slowly destroy our beloved Indy by injecting a mushy and unwarranted love story that is as uncomfortable as it is out of place. The sidekick Mutt is only defined by his hair combing. The Russian female villain likes swords. Indy's old war buddy Mac is so two dimensional it is impossible to believe he and Indy were ever friends. Karen Allen reprises her role from Raiders, only this time she has no personality or anything interesting to do or say. Furthermore, couldn't they have sent this woman to the gym? Or had her hair dyed by a professional? I don't mean to be mean, but she looked terrible and unappealing. Every Indy flick has a hottie, until this turd. Indy's love interest resembles a frumpy 5th grade school teacher. Only see this turd of a film if you want to tarnish you view of a prefect trilogy. Total piece of crap.

Having fun with the role, Ford encompasses Indy with the same amount of bravura and spirit as his earlier adventures.

567,Dream_seeker,For a Mixed bagged movie I have respect for the Indiana Jones saga,6,13 October 2008,"Everyone has their share of good and bad remarks about this movie. But i have to honestly say reading the novels and actually seeing, ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" Then watching the the three movies including this one i can say the Indy franchise is very story driven. What most people don't understand about this story line is that its set in years of his life and being that this movie was set in 1957, he was in his mid fifties if not older; And for those that haven't read the books chronicling his adventures i'm sure you would see that aliens are far more less than most of the stuff he's faced.But anyways, The storyline might be okay at most being that its not fully connected to the Real crystal skulls but moves the idea to a different matter; but the action is still there; instead of fighting Nazi's he's facing Russians its a change of pace but the premise is still functional; its good to see old faces from the original adventures(I.E. Marion Ravenwood) better her than that loud ass and VERY annoying Willie Scott (I.E. Temple of doom). A lot of people complain that being that Harrison ford is a bit old to play this role again is a contradiction to the years that it was set; You have to understand this is going by a chronological aspect of his life until he reaches his older yet one eyed self (watch young Indy chronicles). I do agree some parts of the movie was a bit useless and some outlines were already established but yet they repeat themselves over like they are trying to jam it into people's minds. What I Don't agree is the fact there wasn't really much use for CGI in most places only in some parts so one can't complain about too much CGI in this film; unlike SOME movies that Whore on the CGI (*Ahem* Mummy: TOTDE). But all in all this is a fun movie that didn't really try hard to make the adventure stick; But did its job to make the movie a fun ride it wasn't so deeply horror stoked like temple of doom, but it was just as breezy as Raiders and character oriented as the novels that portray the hero with the infamous bull-whip and hat. I think this movie was interestingly fun without trying too hard but then again not hard enough . one would say the mummy 3 was better than this movie and now that i've seen this film a couple of times and read the books and see the young Indy chronicles i can now say this movie was better than the mummy and i have more respect for the Indy time line and character(s)involved.6/10 (An okay movie but there were some consistencies with this film)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
568,gundognc,Indiana von Daniken and the Raiders of the Lost Childhood Memories,1,7 June 2008,"I've worked out why there are no good villains in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (hereafter ""Kingdom""). It's because the real villain of the piece is George Lucas who is busy kicking the sh*t out of another great piece of my generation's childhood. Thanks for that, George. I would look forward to ruinous sequels of other Lucas films but I find that there really aren't any others except Willow - and making a sequel to that that was worse than the original is not going to be easy.**Spoiler** The picture starts with Indiana Jones having been kidnapped by Colonel Dr Coco Chanel (Cate Blanchett) - looking less than fetching in the 1957 Chanel Communist Collection. Coco and her Russian pals want Indy to help them locate a mysterious sarcophagus containing the mummified corpse of an alien who was in the spaceship that crashed at Roswell in 1947. Indy knows how to find it because he was involved in the autopsy. This, of course, makes perfect sense since the first thing that you do when you find a crashed alien spaceship is call in an archaeologist. (you can almost hear Lucas cackling at this point, presumably as he takes another sip from his steaming glass of loony juice) This sarcophagus is stored in the top secret US facility last seen at the end of Raiders. Indy's pal, Treacherous ""Shifty"" McTraitor (Ray Winstone) betrays him to the Russians but Indy escapes and by a curious twist of the script ends up in the middle of an nuclear testing area a minute prior to the detonation of an atomic bomb. The Russians who are chasing him try to drive away. Ha ha! Stupid Russians. You cannot outrun an atomic blast. There is only one way to survive nuclear annihilation, every archaeologist knows that - you hide in a fridge. Yes, in a fridge. You learn that on the first day of Archaeology 101. It's in Michaelson's seminal ""Using White Goods to Survive the Atomic War"" (Princeton 1948, ISBN 0011232882423).You know it's all gone horribly wrong (if you hadn't already worked it out) when, as Indy climbs out of the fridge, a nearby CGI gopher does a double take.Returning to the university, Dr Jones finds himself out of a job as a result of FBI suspicion that he may be guilty of ""Unamerican activities"" (such as appearing in this film). A part time Marlon Brando impersonator, Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), who's mother has been kidnapped by the Russians, contacts him with a letter from his old friend ""Ox"" Oxley (John Hurt). The two travel to Peru to rescue Mutt's mother and find the legendary Cheap Plastic Skull that the profoundly bonkers Ox has been gibbering about in his letter.Arriving in Peru, Indy and Mutt recover the Cheap Plastic Skull and are recaptured by Coco and the Russians. Indy is reunited with Marian (from Raiders) who seems to be wearing a face two sizes too small and discovers that Mutt is his son. Cue much ""You're not my father"", ""Search your feelings, Mutt, you know it to be true"" and ""Mutt, I feel the archaeology within you"" etc. The writers can't think of a better way to waste 15 minutes of screen time so we are treated to a half-arsed escape which crowbar's in Indy's fear of snakes (because, God forbid, it wouldn't be an Indiana Jones film if we aren't told that Indy doesn't like snakes). As if to highlight the pointlessness of the scene, Indy and friends are immediately re-recaptured.Escaping from the Russians (third time's the charm) and arriving at the fabled Eldorado the companions find that Spielberg has decided he'd rather be filming ""Close Encounters of the Indiana Jones Kind"". It becomes clear that a bunch of nice plastic aliens taught humanity how to farm, build large pyramid type structures and worship them as gods by cutting each other up with obsidian knives. After a trial that might be slightly threatening if the entire party were quadriplegics they find a group of cheap plastic skeletons (one missing the titular skull). Surprise, surprise they find that ""Shifty"" McTraitor has betrayed them again and Coco reappears to claim the immense power that will be granted to whoever reunites the skull with the skeleton to start a psychic warfare campaign against the west to make them buy her nasty communo-wear. Sadly for her the deux ex machina incinerates her for no well explained reason. Indy and friends escape in time to see the whole city get destroyed by the giant flying saucer that the cheap plastic aliens had buried underneath it (good God, I really, really wish I was making this up).**End Spoiler** Kingdom isn't a spectacularly bad film. In many ways that is a shame as I feel that if someone is going to ruin something as good as Indiana Jones they may as well do it in style. Lucas has clearly gone completely bat-sh*t insane and I am assuming that he is unaware of all the basic criticisms that were levied against the new Star Wars films because he makes many of the same mistakes here. The film is too long, there is an over-abundance of unnecessary detail which doesn't move the story forward and while some of the set pieces have a touch of the old magic they either fall flat for continue far too long. The spark just isn't there.Go and see this film, I promise that if you are a fan of the original three Indiana Jones films this'll make you want to break into George Lucas' house and smear crap onto all the pictures in his childhood photo albums - just so that he knows what it is like to have happy memories shat on by an idiot.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
569,TomCruiseFan99,NO! Another franchise gets the overblown treatment!,1,28 May 2008,"I really wanted to love this film. I went through my Indy DVD collection over the weekend just to re-acquaint myself with the lore and the characters. And all these years later, I still loved Raiders and Last Crusade. (Less said about Temple, the better) But now with Kingdom, well lets break it down, first third was good but bordering on the ridiculous. Middle third was brilliant, awesome chase sequence in the jungle, spoiled only by Shia's tarzan imitation (apparently he's a master at vine-swinging), but the last third was mind-bogglingly atrocious!!! For those who haven't seen it, I won't spoil it, but what happened to the script? Did they change writers or something? The most inane climax for an Indy movie. I nearly stood up in the audience screaming at the top om my lungs ""what have you done, bring back our Indy, the one we remember from the 80's and 90's"". When the movie ended, everyone walked out scratching their heads, thinking ""what just happened"", Shia was unnecessary character, Cate was cartoonish villain (her accent thicker than Shia's hair), and there was too much suspension of disbelief required. Raider's and Last Crusade worked because the objects of the treasure hunts were real, and in those films, never have so many men taken shots at Indy with machine guns...and continually miss. I've since come to the conclusion that Russians are awful shots.And a fridge made of lead seems to be the best investment. By the way, did all the other fridges in the other houses also get blown clear of test site??? On the plus side, Harrison performed admirably, and the special effects were expectedly astounding. Not the way I expected this franchise to turn out. Personall, I think it's had a brilliant opening weekend because fans of the series had to see it on the big screen, like me.

Overlong, a clearly too old for the part Harrison, and -- worryingly -- a son to continue the series that was fresh only in its first installment. Yet, the worst part was that all the previous ideas were rehashed (including the death of Irina Spalko which mimes the death of the German baddie at the end of Lost Ark) and some of the worst special effects I have seen from Spielberg. The final bit with everything flying about and Harrison seemingly in harm's way but only ducking here and there was one of the least believable scenes I have seen in some time.

572,TermlnatriX,Don't forget what these films ARE.,8,25 May 2008,"I had no preconceptions formed going into this, and I did not have an Indy marathon beforehand like a lot of people did. You could say I went in there with a fresh, unbiased mind and that surely helped me form what I'm about to say. This is entertainment. As far as I know, that's all the Indiana Jones films were and all will ever be. There has always been the unbelievability factor present in all the films, and it's here too. There is definitely a lot more of it this time (surviving a nuclear explosion in a fridge? check!) but these films were NEVER, EVERabout realism. And when you accept that notion, this will please you on every level. Ford has still got it, he's got the charisma and a true presence when he plays this character. Shia's addition is also worthy of mention as it adds on an interesting level of conflict - if you will - to the interaction and progression of the series. Spielberg also hasn't lost his touch with trademark humor of the series and I applaud him for it. However, I wish I'd seen a few matte paintings. Maybe it's the nostalgia in me, and I bet that's exactly it...but come on, CGI overkill. How hard is it to use REAL monkeys? I refuse to believe CGI was a better option for capturing that. Spielberg throws in many nods to the previous films, some being as quick as ""blink and you'll miss it"" or should I throw in ""not HEAR, and you'll miss it"" as well?Another thing worthy of mentioning is the whole Russians-as-baddies addition to the series. Koepp and the Co. felt the Nazis were a thing of the past, and being the beginning of the ""Red Scare"" in the United States, somebody felt it's time for THEM. Being a Russian myself, I cringed at the portrayal as any other native whose nationality is being placed in a giant Hollywood film. At least they have used authentic actors. Cate Blanchett nailed the accent pretty well though, but holy overkill on the hammer & sickle on the back of her uniform! Come on, there was never THAT on our uniforms. We're not Nazis you know? But all of that can be let go off as I've stated previously; Indy, is entertainment, not realism.

575,camelot2302,"Oh dear, too much hype, too little delivered",5,23 May 2008,"First I want to get it on the record that I am a HUGE Indiana Jones fan and I have been patiently waiting for this sequel for 19 years. So any complaints I may make here are not gratuitous and for kicks. I more than anyone wanted this film to kick butt but after having just watched it and having considered things deeply before writing this, I have come to the opinion that Lucas and Spielberg ended up making a sub-standard movie - but saying that it could have been a LOT worse.The main drawback is that we waited too damn long for this movie (19 years) and the suspense and anticipation from fans was consequently too high. Then when we finally get the movie, Ford is 65 years old (and showing it), Denholm Elliott is dead (leading instead to a rather campy performance by Jim Broadbent), Sean Connery won't return (he probably saw the script) and the movie is set in 1957 and the bad guys are Russians (give me bad Germans any day!). Cate Blanchett, who normally delivers knockout performances looks bored, Ian Hurt looks like he wants to be somewhere else and Shia LaBeouf is just downright irritating from the moment he appears. I just want to take that crystal skull and smack him with it.As for the script, well it's average, nothing to write home about. I was actually quite pleasantly surprised by the minimal computer special effects. Spielberg must have had Lucas on a leash. But the story itself is actually nothing great and the action sequences short and few. I found myself nodding off to sleep a few times and I never thought THAT would happen in an Indiana Jones movie.But the icing on the cake was the ending. If you want a real jaw-dropper of an ending, a real ""what the hell!!"", a ""what drugs are Lucas and Spielberg smoking?"" ending, then watch this movie. This movie has one of the most ridiculous endings ever. In fact, only Lucas and Spielberg could have come up with an ending like this. They probably think this ending is arty and classy. I found it cringeworthy.The absolute ending has Indy's hat falling at the feet of Mutt Williams - Shia LaBeouf. Please God no. Either make another Indiana Jones movie or end the whole thing. Don't pass the mantle to LaBeouf. Please Lucas, don't screw up Indiana Jones the way you screwed up Star Wars!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
576,crazychap,"Not a masterpiece, but absolutely entertaining",7,30 May 2008,"In the summer of 1981, best friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (the directors of Jaws and Star Wars, respectively) made a tribute based on the classic cliffhanger serials of the 1930s with a Bond-like feel. That ""tribute"" was Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it was an action adventure film that surpassed all expectations, becoming the box office champion of 1981 and nominated for many awards, including BEST Picture (a rarity for action films), solidified the career of the already-famous Harrison Ford and put Karen Allen on the map. Set in 1936, with World War II waiting just below the surface, archaeology professor and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the US government to find and retrieve the Lost Ark of the Covenant while facing fierce competition from the Nazis, who are aided by a rival archaeologist.Two sequels would follow, 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (actually a prequel, as it takes place in 1935) and 1989's Last Crusade (set in 1938). Both sequels were great box-office draws, but both received a comparatively less favourable critical reception, especially Temple of Doom, which stirred up a lot of outrage for its portrayal of an Indian Cult. All three movies took place in the immediate pre-World War II era, before the war machine erupted in autumn 1939.Now, It is 1957, and things have surely changed. It has been 19 years since the end of the Last Crusade (which also coincide with the gap between the films' release dates); World War II ended with the defeat of Dr. Jones's traditional enemy, the Nazis (from Raiders and Crusade); close friend Marcus Brody (Elliot McDermott) and father Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) have recently passed away; the new international order is split between the Communist world v.s the Capitalist world (with everything in between) and Indy is trailed by the FBI (and also by the KGB) due to Mac's, his longtime partner, history as a double-agent and Jones's recent forced cooperation with the Soviets to find a warehouse that includes captured artifacts (which coincidentally includes the Ark). While trying to leave the country temporarily to escape the FBI, he encounters a young man named Mutt Williams, a rebellious drop-out in the likes of James Dean and Marlon Brando. He persuades Jones to come with him and help rescue his mother, who turns out to be Indy's lingering flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and Professor Oxley (Hurt), both held captive by the same Soviets Indy has encountered early on. Indy reluctantly agrees, and decides to help him battle the Soviets in a race reminiscent of the Last Crusade, except that it is set in South America.Surely, all these years have created a lot of hype over the Indiana Jones movies, and to tell you the truth, this movie lives up to most of it. On the positive side, Harrison Ford is impressively fit (both physically and mentally) as Indy and is every inch as likable now as he was back then, the action sequences are top-notch, and for the most part, done without the infamous CGI, the special effects are very good, and it's very good to see Karen Allen, my personal favourite of the Jones ladies (and for most, I might say), return in this movie. The moments of humour are effective, and the movie's fast pace never lets up for a minute. The plot twist between Indy, Marion, and Mutt (whose real name is Henry Jones III) is a grabber.On the flip side, the screenplay has a number of gaps and unfinished ideas. First of all, there is almost no back-story shown about what has Indy done through all this time other than spoken dialogue, but most importantly, the Soviets are portrayed in an unfairly stereotypical manner, making them essentially the Nazis of the past films with a hammer and sickle. Cate Blanchett's character, Irina Spalko isn't well written despite the actress's convincing portrayal, and her Soviet grunts are just stock. Mac (Winstone) makes some great comic relief, but I find his double-triple agent subplot too far-fetched, even for spy-story standards.All in all, this movie reminds me of what action movies are all about: a temporary escape hub from our drab everyday lives, plenty of slam-bang, explosions, stunts, exotic locations, the whole shebang. And this movie meets all the requirements. Crystal Skull may pale when compared to Raiders and the Last Crusade, I personally find it better than the mercilessly dark and gloomy Temple of Doom. The movie may be flawed, but you'll surely be entertained from the first scene down to the end credits.Originally, Indiana Jones was meant to be a five-picture deal. With this movie, the deal is just one film short of completion. I can't wait for the sequel!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
577,thebrighteyes,This movie is a great experience for any Indiana Jones fan.,8,23 May 2008,"It was quite an experience seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull because, unlike some recently-rebooted sequels (like Rambo and Rocky Balboa), I was a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series as a little kid. So, seeing a new one was pretty awesome and enjoyable for that reason alone. But even better than that, this movie was actually really good.I think that most fans going into this movie weren't really concerned about Harrison Ford's age (because we know he could kick ass no matter how hold he is), but rather, there seemed to be a concern over the casting choice of Shia LaBeouf. I'm not really sure why (I thought he did a nice job in Transformers), but he actually was pretty good in this movie (and very funny) even though his character was a little over the top at times.The story is unique, and the mythology of it is quite different than the mythology of the previous films, which I wasn't quite sure I liked... but, eh, it was cooler than the mythology of Temple of Doom.This movies gives us one appearance from a member of the original cast with many references to previous films. However, these references aren't in-your-face, and somebody probably could easily enjoy this movie without knowing anything about the other Indiana Jone's movies.The action scenes were all very well done - some of the best I've seen in years. However, these scenes (and even other non-action moments) seemed to heavily rely on CGI which I didn't think fit in very well with the series. The lighting, at times, also seemed very much like a comic book, which is a different tone than the previous films took (which tended to be a bit darker).Overall it was very good, and I'm sure I'll go see it a second or third time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
578,tobybunning,Just not needed to be honest,6,25 June 2019,"The Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (I) Temple of Doom (II) and the Last Crusade (III) have all lived reached a certain level of expectation and have all been able to achieve peoples standards.However just by the title of this film you knew it was going to be below par in comparison to the original trilogy.For starters the characters and know they were played by were not the greatest but Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones still had his traits from the original trilogy as well as Karen Allen as Marion and fair play to Spielberg for bringing her back.
Shia Labeouf as Mutt Jones however does shows that his character did have certain traits of Indiana as to jumping into situations without thinking but there are a few actors who some would say would deliver a more solid performance. Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko was delivered a good but could have delivered a better performance. Ray Winstones performance was somewhat good but the whole point of the character was just not needed. John Hurt as the Ox performance did show that his character was obsessed with his mission and he did look like he was disconnected from the rest of the world.The storyline of the film is again sub par when compared to the original trilogy and as soon as you either read the title or see the crystal skull for the first time you know it was going to be a film that wont deliver when compared to the others.Overall definitely below par when compared to the others, Characters and their performances were substandard apart from Indiana and Marion and the plausibility of the whole film being that it was about aliens when compared to religious objects that had powers was again not up to standard when compared to each other.Solid 6/10 in total",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

How does end up? well, Its a damn good movie all the way to the horrific ending parts that made me go ""wtf?!?!?!?""This movie has everything a Indiana film should have and also some stuff that should had been left out completely. I almost hope that they can re-cut the DVD/bd release of this film and make the ending fit the rest of the film. It could be done, as I can't really talk about the ending here without making spoilers, you should go see the film and judge for yourself.But I can assure you from start to those, damn you writers, last scenes this movie is a fun ride, all actors do their roles really good and even shia, that I don't really like due to his more or less silly humorous characters, are here being given a more grown up character to play and have been toned down on the bad onliners he usually spits out.Caves are being explored, dungeons, mystical writings, great action scenes.

583,cracker,"Atrocious and Awful, don't believe the shill reviews to the contrary",2,23 May 2008,"Could go on and on, but will hit only the low points and offer a comparison that sums up the entirety of this extremely bad movie.Remember when Indiana is poisoned in ""Temple of Doom"" and has to scramble for the antidote? the excellent choreography, camera work, and suspense? In this movie the equivalent scene involves Jones hiding in a lead-lined refrigerator, thus surviving the ""warm"" conditions of a ground zero nuclear explosion...because the refrigerator is lined with lead... ugh. We love to suspend our disbelief for these movies, but this is going a bit far, even for children. The movie actually manages to go downhill from the refrigerator scene, way downhill.The acting is bad all around. Cate Blanchett, my favorite actress, is cast as the villain parody, but manages to bring neither the humor nor menace to the role required for the device to succeed as it has so effectively in the past. You can almost see her struggling to squeeze something good out of the awful script.Shia Lebeouf is wooden and untalented. I challenge any of the ""pro-skull"" folks here to go back and re-watch Harrison Ford in any of his early movies and make a favorable comparison with a straight face. None can be made...John Hurt is totally wasted by the script. Karen Allen as well.To cap this franchise, with its clever predecessors, we get as the primary suspense... a car chase, and a bad one at that. In fact, the only clever cinematography in the movie occurs during the first two minutes as kids drag race an army convoy. Nothing clever after... nothing.They are obviously trying to transition the franchise to the next generation, and grooming LeBeouf as the new icon. I have no idea what his connections in Hollywood are, but they must be truly immense in relation to his talent.Much more to say, but will leave it at that. Don't waste your time or money on this unless you have very young children... very young.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
584,puffball97,"Welcome Back, Indy!",7,15 June 2008,"I had a swell time seeing Harrison Ford at a ripe near-66 years young strutting his usual stunts as Indiana Jones. He is a wonderful role model for aging men and as his return as his famed character in this latest installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" he has not slowed down a bit. Maybe he is doing lesser stunts, and is spending more time as a university professor, but Ford feels that age should not be a detriment to his character or his acrobatics.Also adding to youthful middle-age is Karen Allen. She doesn't get to do as many stunts as she did as Marion in the first of the series, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" but, at 56, she appears in the second hour of the film looking even better than she did when she was pushing 30. Allen smiles a lot throughout this current installment, and that smile gives her a countenance of youth.As for the plot, it is 1957, more than 20 years after Indiana Jones' first adventure. Indy gets called to uncover a crystal skull in the Amazon Jungle of Peru, battling a villainous army of Russians headed by the exotic Colonel Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). Blanchett combines the Russian accent with her own Aussie accent, giving her voice a seductive international rhythm. The fights and chases are always exciting to watch as we see who gets their hands on the skull. And in every ""Indiana Jones"" movie, a gross creature scene is never left out to keep us awake and at the edge of our seats - from snakes, to insects, to rats, and now swarms of giant ants that heap up the amazon.There is a brand near character in this - Mutt Williams, played by Shia LeBouf. He is a Marlon Brando type of a young man who claims that Indy is his illegitimate father, and enlists him to help his estranged mother in the Peruvian forest. Mutt is the catalyst of reuniting Indy with Marion. Mutt also brings comic relief to the movie with his 50's tough-guy, greaser-biker caricature. Midway through the movie, there is a hilarious aside where Mutt gets into a fight in the malt shop.What seems to be the problem with the latest installment is that it copies the plot line of ""Raiders,"" you know, the expedition, the university, the assignment, the expedition, the reunion of long-lost lovers, the battles, the gross insects, and a finale where the villains gets the same gory treatment as the original Nazis. Thus, it appears that ""Crystal Skull"" is a more of a remake of ""Raiders"" than a sequel. But there is no criticizing the excitement and fast-pacing that doesn't lose a beat. Occasionally, the movie gets talky when it comes to the university scenes, and also a bit heavy-handed as it asks us to get sentimental over a photo of Sean Connery, Indy's father in the third installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" which, of course, it is not. It may not be as Oscarworthy as ""Raiders"" was, but it is pure summer escapism.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
585,Dr_Kruger,"It's not all bad, just mostly",5,27 May 2008,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. The Indiana Jones films were without doubt my favourite trilogy. I loved all three for different reasons, in particular the first two although Last Crusade was a worthy ending to the trilogy. I don't think it's nostalgia that makes me feel this way. I have the DVD set and have watched them many times leading up to the 4th instalment and they still fill me with joy and excitement, as they do my son who I let watch them, and without pressure from myself he also claimed they were his favourite films of his short life too. I guess the Crystal Skull always had a lot to live up to in that respect and, unless it recreated exactly the atmosphere, chemistry and excitement of the first three, it was never going to live up to my expectations. Unfortunately, I was let down in almost every aspect by this film. However, instead of going on forever about how it let me down for fear of rambling I'll just list the key points that disappointed me. Here goes: 1/ Indy is an archaeologist. He's at his best when chasing ancient artifacts with religious implications. It's just more fitting. I hated the story and the twist it took 2/ Ford was too old, not physically, the body seemed willing but his facial expressions were tired and unengaging. 3/ The action sequences felt poorly thought through and in many cases were pointless and didn't feel like they contributed anything to the plot 4/ Ray Winstone's character was annoying. He double-triple-quadruple crossed Indy and yet Indy kept letting him 'tag along'. WHY!!!!!!!?????? 5/ John Hurt could've done so much more. He was wasted. Would've been much better had he been Abner and had more of a prominent role. 6/ Blanchett, while a great actress was by far the weakest villain of all the 4 films. Even Donovan was a better character in 'last crusade'...and why Russians, it just seemed like it was a case of 'I guess we've done the Germans to death who next? I know why not the Ruskies 7/ I was excited by the reintroduction of Marion, but where in Raiders she was cool, sexy and played the role perfectly, in Skulls she was annoying and the chemistry between her and Indy was lost. 8/ Spielberg and his effects men studied the first three to try and recreate a similar feel. They didn't study hard enough. The CGI was over the top. The ants sequence was a poorly disguised copy of the scenes with the beetles in 'The Mummy'. 9/ I was finding my mind was wandering through the 2nd half of the film due to the points above. That would have never happened through the first three 10/ Hated the ending, plain and simple. You'd think I absolutely abhorred it reading my comments so far, but I have to be hard on the film. It's like Eastwood making a 4th dollars movie, it's bound to be analysed to death and any tiny problems highlighted. It's just unfortunate that they were major not minor problems. Despite it's problems it wasn't all bad. Some of the script was decent. I liked some of Indy's lines. Shia Lebeuf's character, who I thought was going to be annoying, was actually pretty decent (apart from the tree swinging). Unfortunately there's nothing in here that's going to make me give it more than half marks. As a standalone movie it would've got a 6, maybe a 7 as it is, it's a 5/10 from me......and I'm absolutely gutted",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
586,digitalbrian,Refreshing and the best Indy movie so far,8,23 May 2008,"I was around when the first 3 movies premiered in theaters, and it was a big deal, honestly some of the best adventure movies made prior to The Mummy movies.My complaint with the old ones is that they were too simple, I mean: ""Nazi's want the Ark, Indy does not want them to have Ark, Nazi's too stupid to listen to Indy so Nazi's dies when opening the Ark""That's the first movie way too simple but still a great movie for the time it was released.Now this one is great because the adventure is so much bigger, and with the effects they can make now it is bloody fantastic, also the fact they put Shia in it is just great! Spoiler Alert: We all guessed it even before the trailer came out, Shia's character is Indy's long lost Son with the chick he picked up in the first movie, and I have a feeling he is going to take over the franchise, and good for him, I watched Shia since Even Stevens and he is meant to become a movie legend.I saw way too many effects and ideas stolen from the National Treasure movies in this movie, but we must not forget that in the end, Indiana Jones is all about The Jokes, The Hat and the Whip.People who do not believe in Aliens will say this is far fetched, but so was the Ark and the Crusade, come on these things are fiction and movies exist to take us away from the real world and all our problems, Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull succeed in doing just that, and it hardly have one dull moment.GO SEE IT!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
587,Dark Raven,Who wrote this rubbish?,2,22 May 2008,"Like all intelligent movie loving people who have decent standards and did not like this movie, I too have to flag my review with the proviso that I am one of the biggest fans of the original trilogy.This film is empty, periless, tensionless, laughable (in some good ways but many bad ways too) light on action and heavy on green screen. All in all that to me ain't the ingredients for an Indiana Jones movie.The 'bad guy'. The antagonist in any of these films is usually a big threat to Indy. Either through cunning or power. Not here. Blanchet does her best with the poor material but we never get a true sense of how menacing she could be. Ray Winston's character is just a lazy cliché of the genre.Peril. There is little sense of true peril. There was always a moment in each Jones film where the audience thinks ""How are they going to get out of this pickle?"" Not here. Much of the action reminded me of the coincidental nonsense that was in The Lost World. Falling through this, bouncing of that, and landing ""Ok let's go"".Action. Every Jones film has an action scene that you remember. Not one in this film. Spielberg commented recently that since the Indiana Jones trilogy there have been many inventive action sequences in event movies, but that this has left, as he put it, ""very little meat on the bone"" for people like him to formulate new action sequences. I dare say that's lazy and a little sad to hear such a master of the craft to admit. To me there will always be cool action sequences as things can always be swapped, changed, reinvented, etc etc - just like Indiana Jones didn't invent action. Buster Keaton was doing things that are still unbelievable to this day. The best action this film comes up with is a tensionless jungle chase with CGI monkeys and the most fake looking sword fight seen this side of a green screen. Poor.The Music. Every Indiana Jones film has a very memorable musical theme (or themes) besides the main march. I was flabbergasted to hear regurgitated themes from The Last Crusade. Especially in one of the final scenes. Another bit sounded exactly like the scene where the tripod comes up in War of the Worlds. What the hell is that? Surely Williams could have come up with some new stuff considering the amount of money gone into this.Finally, and most importantly, the story. At any point in any of the previous Jones films you can tell what is going on and what's at stake and what needs to be done. Here I either didn't care or couldn't tell. And the way Indy takes on the mission was lazy and made the scene where Ian Malcolm takes on the mission in The Lost World seem well developed and gripping.I could go on and many reviewers have pointed out the CGI Gophers, CGI monkeys and an alien worse looking than Brian De Palmas Mission to Mars, so I won't go there. To me I am saddened so deeply by this.The last film ended with Father and son riding off into the sunset. This one ended with Shia combing his hair. Nuff said.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
588,Freddy_Levit,The Crystal that answers that universal question. It's time to ask yourself what YOU believe in!,10,21 May 2008,"The comics and the globe-trotting, adventure serials of the 1930s, 40s and 50s have never been so vividly weaved together and brought to life as in the Indiana Jones adventures. Harrison Ford always embodied everything we ever wanted to be - flawed, resourceful, knowledgeable and heroic. We always identified with his reluctance, to delve into the unknown and hence we always feared for his life. He breathed a new air into an action hero, one driven by primal instincts in life/death situations. Like magic, he opened our eyes inspiring curiosity that ignited a hunger for discovery and exploration, a fire that burns in all of us since the legendary tales of the Iliad and the Odyssey.It is never surprising WHY the franchise became such a hit, because people, drawn by fantasies of conquest, needed a hero to take them there  on a ride. Indiana Jones is THAT hero. We dreamed of exotic locale, of riding horses to rescue the damsel in distress whilst staving off enemies, of unearthing the mysteries of our ancestors and to find artifacts of ancient worlds - he took us there. And like all great epics, we dreamed of impossible romances sweeping over lands far away. It is because these films fulfill these criteria that they have been endlessly revisited for three decades and continue to inspire new generations. Crystal Skull is no exception. The family has been re-united to take us on the LAST CRUSADE? Sends a warm chill down my spine just thinking about the possibility of another one after this.Riding into the sunset at the END of Last Crusade was the perfect closing curtains for the perfect franchise. But we were forever hungry for more. We loved Indiana Jones more than other heroes, because he was like us, ""Giddy as a school boy"". When I heard a new one was being made, my heart skipped a beat. It was THE MOST EXCITING NEWS! As it turns out I was not disappointed at all. The film works on all levels, and it rarely borrows from it predecessors. It is different in every way. The location, the father-son relationship, the 20 year gap, the new characters and the most bizarre adventure I've ever seen filled the screen to create an Indy movie everyone had been waiting for. We find out more about Indy's mysterious life. We are introduced to his son Mutt, who is as rich a character as Indy himself, although completely different. References to previous adventures and characters warms our hearts and old flames make us feel right at home. Even with the consistent poke at Indy's age  the film taking place 20 years after CRUSADE, with Stalin as the enemy  the movie never slows down. Williams' tight score, Kaminski's breathtaking photography and under Spielberg's expert direction the film starts like a rocket, slow at the start but quickly builds speed and doesn't stop until the BIG BANG! It was the greatest cinematic roller-coaster experience since discovering Indiana Jones as a kid. I was immersed into the story like a child playing a computer game. I couldn't blink nor divert my attention. I was ACTUALLY watching another Indiana Jones movie. Reading other comments, I have noticed that people were put off by the involvement of Aliens in it. Many believe that Indiana Jones was defined around the search for Religious relics. Whilst I agree with them on this point, considering the previous films WERE about such endeavors, I would like to make the following points. Indiana Jones is a throwback, a nod to the old adventure serials and action films of the Douglas Fairbanks/Errol Flynn era, an era filled with swashbucklers, grave diggers and romantics. An era that filled eager kids with infinite imaginations of far away lands, of lost treasures, religious artifacts and the unknown. Comic strips and comic books took children on epic heroic journeys (Phantom, Flash Gordon and Tintin just to name a few). Spielberg was not the only director inspired them. Countless directors attempted to revive the genre, the most famous being David Lean. Lawrence Of Arabia took all the Oscars home showing that people were spellbound by such tales. Raiders Of The Lost Ark was a Arab/desert adventure. Temple Of Doom was an Indian/jungle/cave adventure. Last Crusade was a European/Arab/desert adventure. It was inevitable the latest outing was to be in the Amazon jungles of Peru (something different). Ancient South American civilizations have forever been a focus of wonder and imagination. One common question is how these ancient civilizations were technologically superior to the rest of the world, being cut away from the rest of the world. These ideas, unanswered questions and the ingenuity and architectural brilliance of these extinct peoples created many theories and suggestions as to their origins. Needless to say, although the first three films were based on REAL religions and LEGENDARY treasures, we neglect to realize that they're all just fantasies (""Power of god, fortune and glory""). All the supernatural aspects of the artifacts are all made up for the film's enjoyment. As bizarre as Crystal Skull is, we tend to forget that we are watching a serial. Serials are bizarre, action/adventure driven and completely fantastic. It's not like we didn't need to suspend our disbelief when watching the originals. The latest film's plot is one of the most engrossing, mesmerizing AND bizarre adventure stories I ever saw. I loved every second of it. IT FELT LIKE AN INDIANA JONES MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH. This is a perfect companion to the originals and it doesn't slow down for a moment.Finally I want to reassure all those that haven't seen this masterpiece that Harrison Ford, being 65, looks as awesome as ever and I can't see him slowing down in the new future. Should Spielberg and Lucas decide to take us to the Outback on another adventure, I will welcome it with open arms.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
589,mgoldhamer,Indiana Jones 4: Marion Ravenwood's Revenge,7,9 June 2008,"Indiana Jones 4, is the secret history of Marion Ravenwood! Everything in the film, leads the viewer, to the discovery of the lost, first love, of Jr. Yes, Marion (Karen Allen) has aged, gracefully, but so has Indiana (Harrison Ford). The film is a marvelous, spectacle, of a 1950's time capsule, where our adventurers, leap across the globe, and back again. Indiana steps into one pot-boiler, and then into another, without so much as the time, to hold, his breath. Each action-packed sequence, is an Easter Egg, leading to the reunion, with Marion. A strange young man, on a motorcycle, dressed like an extra from the film, The Wild One, (1954) grabs onto Indianas' coat tails and stays along for the ride, until the ending credits start to roll. His name is Mutt, (Shia La Beouf) and he is very, handy, with a blade. Marion's Revenge, is more like the Saturday afternoon thrillers, of the 1930's and the 1940's, the action, never stops. Director Steven Spielberg, really deserves a tip of the hat, for out-doing himself, in the area of special effects, with this film. Well over two hours in length, one can only imagine, what will be added in the Director's Special Edition, when it becomes available on DVD. When we finally do view Marion, she still has that angelic, sweet smile, with the hint of the devil, just underneath. Marion and Indy, still make a pretty strong pair, in any poker hand. This is not a film for the family, to go see on a rainy, Saturday afternoon. This film is adult in nature, and violence. What lies ahead for Marion and Indiana, is part of the secret of the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls. What is Marion Ravenwood's final revenge to Indians Jones?

590,Imaculata,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,4,8 June 2008,"If you are expecting to see a movie that matches your favorite childhood trilogy, then this movie is bound to disappoint you. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a decent movie, in that is manages to entertain, but that is about it.It's good for a night out, perhaps even for a date, but in the case of the latter the date is probably worth more of your attention than the actual movie. The movie lacks the mystery, good script, and good plot that the previous three movies had, and some of the action sequences often reach a point where they become so unrealistic, that even the average Indiana Jones audience (who are used to a certain degree of far fetched stunts) feels like the director (that would be Spielberg) is insulting their intelligence. Without spoiling anything about the movie itself, let me just refer to a now notorious scene with a fridge that sets the average tone of the movie. (In other words, the movie continues its downward spiral from that moment on) The disappointment cannot really be blamed on the actors, who seem to be giving it their best shot. But overall there are just too many characters to give all of them enough time to develop, and the way they are introduced often feels horribly forced. Cate Blanchett gives a good performance as the leading bad girl Dr. Irina Spalko, which is immediately wasted by the way her character is introduced. Right at the start of the movie, the character is basically humiliated in a way that makes it impossible for the audience to take her serious, or consider her any sort of threat from that moment on. It is a clear case of a movie that cannot be saved by big bucks and big stars.This raises the question where all the money went. The most obvious answer would be special effects, which do look quite decent I have to admit. But since the computer imagery runs throughout the entire movie, for some viewers it might be a bit much. I suspect many will be craving for a movie that relied more on a good plot, rather than on CGI. I certainly was one of such viewers.On many occasions the sheer number of green screens, computer animated wildlife, and even *gasp* computer generated plants(!) became such a distraction, I found it hard to enjoy the many action sequences. It just started to become annoying, especially since a lot of this sort of stuff could have been done for real, and looked better. Personally I suspect Kotcs suffers from a bit of the George Lucas taint in the special effects department, who seems to think that CGI can replace a good plot, dialogue and acting (like in the Starwars prequels, and that's a tough thing to admit for a die hard Starwars fan such as myself).The key problem with Kotcs is the number of scenes that simply do not lead anywhere. There are quite a number of moments in the movie (if not just about every moment) where I asked myself ""why are they here again?"", ""how did they get here?"" and ""what was the point?"". In fact even after the typical Spielberg ending (which was incredibly predictable and disappointing) the very same question still lingered. What was the point? What did the characters get out of all of this? The entire movie just felt like a bunch of random ideas stitched together.So is it all a big disappointment? No, that wouldn't be fair. I did enjoy myself in the theater, and I don't consider it wasted money. However, I would recommend to just sit this one out. It's better to wait till its out on DVD, or better yet, TV. Kotcs isn't the great fourth installment of the series I was waiting for, and after seeing this I hope they don't make a fifth movie. If it took them 10 years only to come up with THIS script, then I guess the well of ideas has seriously dried up.A clear case of a fridge too far.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
591,vinnieboards,Indiana Jones - For a Few Dollars More (in the Pension Fund),5,25 February 2011,"Like most people, I took no notice of the first release reviews of this film, opting to watch it and judge for myself.I have to say that there is one major positive - Harrison Ford looks fantastic and acts the part with the same gusto as in 1981, some feat for an actor now in his Sixties. The film has the same adventurous feel of the older films and with a quality cast you would think that this would be a sure fire winner. From a box office perspective the film was a massive worldwide hit. But from a viewers perspective...Two words...oh dear!! Firstly the film is let down by some bad casting. Ray Winstone is absolutely terrible in the film, a shame as he has made some really decent stuff. Nobody can dispute Cate Blanchett's pedigree as a fine actress but for me, her character doesn't really work. But the biggest problem with this epic is the stunts and special effects.The film has become a victim of its own enormous success. When Spielberg & Lucas made these films in the 80's certain special effects and stunts were actually invented for these flicks, in fact, the documentaries surrounding the making of the films were just as fascinating as the end products. I recall the showing of how they filmed the Thuggi leader falling off the rope bridge to be snapped up by the crocodiles (Temple of Doom). Doesn't look anything special now but at the time it was unbelievable.With blockbusters in recent times like the Lord of Rings Trilogy using advanced CGI, we see a new Indian Jones film for the first time with stunts and effects which are quite simply 'not that special'. This isn't a fault of the movie maker or the actors - its just a fact that Raiders of the Lost Ark and the follow up films were state of the art. Anyone expecting the same is therefore in for a major disappointment. For this to have been a major success, then people would have needed to change their perspective, but how can they? Indiana Jones is a legend, an icon, an 80's superhero. Still, the film is entertaining and its brilliant to see Ford still doing stunts at his age when us mere mortals feel exhausted just watching them.Its been muted that there is going to be another Indiana Jones film to be made again with Harrison Ford and Shia LeBouef. I beg you Mr Spielberg & Mr Lucas - don't do it!! Let all movie lovers remember the wonderful films from the 80's and not have the memory tarnished by more money making dross. But because in reality, that's all it is.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
592,Awakening124,The 'crystal skull' is made of PLASTIC and filled with aluminum FOIL.,5,25 May 2008,"Sadly, my subject line was not a joke. The central prop of a movie with a budget way north of $100 million looks like it was made by a bored 12 year old. The rest of the movie follows suit.When I think about the things they put into this movie, it really baffles me. From the horrific snake prop (which ruins an otherwise great Indy moment) to some of the worst green screens and CGI work I've ever seen, Indy 4 just fails, and pretty miserably at that.The funniest line of the movie made me slightly chuckle, and every other good line was in the trailer. The stunt doubles are PAINFULLY obvious, and the poor cast is reduced to almost nothing by a really awful script. There are so many screamingly bad moments in this movie, and the rare moment that's not so bad is in the trailer, so you've seen it.That's another thing: IF YOU'VE SEEN THE TRAILER, YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING EVEN REMOTELY GOOD THAT THIS MOVIE HAS TO OFFER. I'm serious. With the exception of a cool shot of Indy watching a mushroom cloud billow up (and that's ruined by the fact that he just randomly escaped from the blast against every law of physics in the book), you've seen it all.Who do we have to blame for all of this? Geoge Lucas. No, I'm not a mindless Lucas hater, it just so happens to be a cold hard fact that Lucas is the one who screwed this movie up. Evidence: 1. A while back, Spielberg had a script that he was really excited about and all ready to shoot. at the last minute, Lucas looked at it and decided to throw the whole thing out and start over. 2. It took Lucas YEARS (that's right, YEARS) to CONVINCE Spielberg and Ford that putting ALIENS in an INDY film wasn't just a good idea, but as good of an idea as the ARK.So is there anything in this thing that's GOOD? I did like the final moment of the film because, while it set up Shia to take over as his own type of Indy, it also makes the point that no one will ever be Indy. There's also a really funny moment when Indy is getting scrubbed down, and it's all thanks to Ford. These little moments don't save the movie by any stretch of the imagination, though.Be careful, Lucas, your work is starting to remind me of Uwe Boll.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
593,rumbleinthejungle,People who saw the original films as kids and young adults will be mostly satisfied.,6,27 July 2009,"Don't try and judge an Indiana Jones film through your adult eyes - if you do then you might not end up having as much fun as you're supposed to. Mostly it seems that people took this fourth film WAY too seriously. I mean, Temple Of Doom isn't that great and The Last Crusade isn't quite as good as everyone would have you believe it is either. KOTCS is about as good as a fourth installment can get in any franchise. We're talking the law of ever diminishing returns here, folks.Having said all that, I will admit that there are some cheesy bits in here - Shia LeBoeuf's faux Brando get up is fairly ridiculous and the chase scene in the jungle replete with Tarzan vine swinging sequence will be a little too much for some, but there is some good stuff in here. Ford looks good and it's great to see Karen Allen back in the fold. John Hurt's character is good fun and Cate Blanchett is obviously having a great time playing the evil Russian scientist. Yes - some of the action set-pieces aren't quite as good as they were in the previous films and the tone is perhaps a little too reverential towards the films of yesteryear, but i do think that there is more than enough in here to satisfy all but the most ardent Dr. Jones enthusiasts.Spielberg always said that he regretted making Temple of Doom as dark and as violent as it is, so Last Crusade felt like a logical step towards sending Indy back to his gentler afternoon matinée roots. If you look at the first two Indy films as being quite adult and brooding and the last two as being consciously geared towards the whole family then KOTCS fits in well with this lineage. Everybody knows that Raiders is the best film in the series. You can't touch it.It's also worth noting that every even numbered Indy film has been one that hasn't pitted him against the Nazi's.

Who was it who said good movies are a visual, not a spoken, medium? How many menacing, deeply rumbling stones can slide into position in one movie? Snakes, ants, Russians, cliffs, whatever, yawn. And where did they get that plastic skull prop with the Christmas tinsel and a couple of LEDs inside it? Didn't the actors feel DUMB pretending that thing was in any way important? Next, we will get the amusement park theme ride and the rest of the junk, God help us. Did anyone really want to make this movie? Save your money.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
596,MashedA,Overall this is a good romp that takes care of two hours of your life without having to check your watch.,9,26 May 2008,"When you revisit a franchise after so long there are always going to be comparisons to those that have gone before There will inevitably be those who will be aghast at a sequel made by a man that could be unfairly described as a man in his twilight years. There will even be those who will find plot holes, leaps of faith and unbelievable story lines a bridge too far!Not me. I'm so glad Indy is back I can forgive almost all the above! The Indiana Jones films are meant to be far-fetched, they are meant to be entertaining, they are meant to be tongue in cheek, but most of all. fun! And on all counts it pushes the right buttons.There are many films out there that have that have stolen the clothes of Indiana Jones for example ""The Mummy"", ""Tomb Raider"" & ""National Treasure"" to name but a few. Indiana Jones still holds on to the mantle although purists with undoubtedly set unrealistic standards they wouldn't have applied to the other films just because they have too. Those who are panning this film obviously have grown too old to enjoy themselves.Ford has taken on a huge risk, he could have played safe and left the franchise as it was. He surely doesn't need the money. This film in my opinion adds to the previous trilogy. The intervening years have made Ford a little more crumpled and grey around the temples; however he slipped back in to the old leather jacket accompanied with his trusty bull-whip and hat like he had never been away!Yes the storyline was fantastical, the action sequences incredible the situations borderline insanity! Show me when that hasn't been the case in the previous three films? I loved this film for all the right reasons, it entertained me! Shia LeBeouf as Mutt Williams was probably a smart move as he seems to be an up and coming star having a series of blockbusters under his belt like Transformers and Disturbia. Having Karen Allen works as another link to the trilogy which was nice to see although her almost permanent grin throughout the movie got somewhat tiresome. Veteran actor John Hurt has had some great roles throughout his career, this however will not be considered one of them, I suppose Hurt has paid his dues to the acting fraternity and is entitled to ham it up a little, but this adds little to the storyline in my opinion.Overall this is a good romp that takes care of two hours of your life without having to check your watch. Go and see this film NOW!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
597,peter-bruck,Indiana Jones and the crystal sucker,3,28 May 2008,"Oh boy, what have I been waiting for all the time? On the bright side: I had a coupon for this movie, so I only paid five euros. But if you don't have a coupon, you might want to write Spielberg an e- mail telling him what you think about this movie. His address is: sucker@paramount.com. But first things first: 1) Indy survived an atomic explosion in a refrigerator, which reminded me a little of Double Team, when Dennis Rodman and Van- Damme survive a giant explosion thanks to a Coke- auto-mat. Not a very good association for an Indy- movie. 2) The mysterious crystal skull is hidden behind a corpse, so they have to put the corpse away to get it. Big f***ing deal! 3) Indy and his friends are on a boat. 3 giant water falls are ahead of them. So you wonder, how spectacularly Lucas/Spielberg/Koepp are going to let them survive. Guess what, they just sit in their boats waiting to go down the water falls. Cut. You see them crawling out of the water as they safely arrived at the bottom of the water falls. Now that's entertainment. 4) They put the crystal skull back on the neck of the skeleton of an alien (oh pardon me, Mr. Spielberg, I meant ""of an inter-dimensional being""). Then thirteen skeletons suddenly become one inter-dimensional being, the sky opens and all the evil Russians are sucked into the ""space between the spaces"". Thanks a lot.This has nothing to do with the Indy- movies we used to love. It's just a try to revive the cult, but it totally blows. There's no plot what so ever between the special effects, everything is so exaggerated, it really hurts watching it. Spielberg destroyed a wonderful franchise. Let's hope there won't be another sequel. Let's hope they see the difference between Indy 4 and the classic trilogy. Steven, let's call it a franchise!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
598,supramaxx,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skulls Review,9,27 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skulls ReviewI have been a huge Indiana Jones fan since I was a little kid, so I was excited when I heard last year they were making the 4th movie installment of the acclaimed trilogy. Of course my main concern was can Harrison Ford do it? I mean he is 65 years old, of course he put those doubts to rest with this awesome installment of Indiana Jones. Spielberg and Lucas again make movie magic with Indiana Jones, delivering a totally original story, an exciting adventure, new enemies, new characters and new history and myth in delivering an awesome and satisfying Indiana Jones experience.Genre: Action/AdventureThe Good: What I most loved about the movie was the story, which I wont fully reveal, only saying that I have always been fascinated, since I was a little kid, with the legends of El Dorado and the mystery of the Nazca Lines. Harrison Ford, Shia LeBouf , and everyone else acted excellent. The 1950's setting was done to a T (the movie takes place in 1957) the cinematography was exceptional again. The soviet enemy was not as intimidating as the Nazi's but they also did very well in creating an enemy figure. Harrison Ford looks a bit his age, but he was in excellent physical condition for this film and he still brings his brand of Indy Humor and Cockiness (Remember he is supposed to be 58 in this film, Indiana Jones was born in 1899) Shia LeBouf as Mutt Williams is an excellent stereotypical cocky 50's kid with a leather jacket. There were also some extremely memorable scenes in this movie in placing the movies in the middle of the atomic age of the 50's, which I will not reveal. I am only saying that this film has so many great qualities, definitely one of my favorites.The Bad: The main complaint was that this movie was too unrealistic in several scenes, guess what? Naysayers.....this is an action/adventure MOVIE. You have to expect some parts to be unrealistic, but it is all in good entertaining fun. I guess thats the only bad part about it.The Ugly: Surviving a nuclear blast, oh yeah, Catacombs, Tombs, Killer Ants, Ugly Russian soldiers, a crazed archaeologist and of course what the crystal skull really is.Overall, an awesome Indiana Jones that does not disappoint. Its an awesome thrill ride and Harrison Ford still has what it takes to be Indiana Jones Jr.Supra Score - 9/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
599,hoju_31,"George, how could you?",1,8 March 2011,"After George Lucas succeeded in ruining the Star Wars franchise with his hilariously terrible prequels, I guess he figured he should go for broke and destroy every beloved franchise he had a hand in. First of all, I'm willing to overlook quite a bit of implausibility in movies, but the scene with the refrigerator is inexcusable. Even if it could somehow survive the blast (it couldn't), inertia alone would have liquefied Indiana's organs, or at least turned all of his bones into tiny shards, yet this 60 year old man walks away unscathed after being thrown several miles through the air in a metal box. Also, it was supposed to take place 10 years after the last movie, yet he clearly aged at least 25 years. Was he drinking and smoking 24 hours a day for those 10 years? Also, he moved like a mildly retarded tree sloth. In this day in age, especially with the overuse of CGI in this movie, couldn't they make him at least look somewhat younger?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
600,anarresa,Worth the Ticket,6,24 May 2008,"I was excited when I heard of a new Indiana Jones, then worried when I saw how old Harrison Ford got, excited anyway because I love Indy, worried when I saw the CGI previews, and on and on. After seeing the film I decided it was worth it. The story is more over-the-top than the previous films (and for the ""franchise"" that's saying something) but it's respectful to the fans and the time that has past and even a bit more fun in some situations because it's not just another movie, it's a love of all things Indiana Jones. Yes the CGI and plot are a bit over-reaching (though the ark of the covenant wasn't all that grounded) but this is NOTHING like the disaster that was Star Wars 1-3. Re-watch Raiders of the Lost Ark (you know you want to) and go looking for a good time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
601,darlybrito,Good Enough,7,15 June 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was the film that everyone was getting hype about before it came out and I honestly don't know were all that hype came from. I understand that the old Indy films were classics, but Harrison Ford is just too old to play Indiana Jones now. It would have been better if Indy 4 came out years ago.Before seeing the movie, I didn't have high expectations for Indiana Jones 4. I was expecting the movie to be an average movie. In my opinion, there was nothing really catchy about the movie. After I saw the film, my expectations were just right.I thought Indiana Jones 4 was entertaining and an enjoyable film. The story was well developed and it caught my attention. The fact that they took realistic ideas from today was kind of a thumps up for the movie. The acting in the movie was solid and I don't think there was a great performance from Harrison Ford. He is a great actor, but this one was not his best or worst. There were some really nice special effects in the movie. I thought that was a plus in the flick.One of the things that I didn't like about the movie was that there were scenes that the humor didn't work out at all. It really annoyed me because some scenes were kind of long. I'm not going to tell you what scenes were you will probably know what I'm talking about.Overall, Indiana Jones 4 was a good pop-corn flick that I enjoyed for the most part. The film that I have high expectations is The Dark Knight. That's probably the film everybody wants to see after Indy 4 disappointment some fans.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
602,p_jones92,Oh dear Dr. Jones....,5,16 November 2008,"Nostalgia - sometimes it's a good thing and sometimes it's bad. In this instance, it's bad.Yes, the 80's throwback continues, we see it in fashion, in music, and in movies. It's a shame as I'm an 80's child, and I'm seeing all these teenagers now trying to imitate the look of the 80's and I feel slightly miffed that they're trying to copy and claim my childhood as if it's their own, and also as if they're the first to discover it and we didn't actually know what we were doing in the original 80's. We did know what we were doing, because we had the original Indy trilogy, and it was bad ass.However, the reason it was bad ass was because it was of the moment, it was part of that history of that time and captured it perfectly. As with when I look at all the kids in the leggins and pumps and day-glow colored clothes today, it doesn't work because it doesn't actually reflect the times, it's not worn with the same attitude, it's a fake imitation, and imitations are never as good as the real thing. The 80's look was cool was because it was in the 80's. Take it out of the 80's and it doesn't work. The same can be said for Indy 4.Reading the trivia section on IMDb, you can tell it has had a long and troubled production history, and it actually shows in the finished movie. The story feels a mis-mash of different ideas from different screenplays (which it is), written to incorporate set piece ideas from the director rather than tell a story (which it was), and filled with one liners and pointers to how good the other movies were rather than continuing the story of the life and adventures of Indian Jones (which it does).And it gets worse. The directing is actually pretty poor (I know, who'd have thought you'd ever here someone say that about Steven Spielberg). Some of the shot selection, or repetitive points of view and camera pans, is ridiculously amateur. The cinematography is not great either. There's an unbelievable amount of lens flaring in shots (and if this was by design, then it was a poor decision) and the lighting is poorly executed, because you can easily tell the difference between location, studio, and green screen shots, because the lighting changes so dramatically. The sound man also needs to be shot, the amount of re-dubbing, particularly during the first 3rd of the movie, smacks of a poor job.The action sequences are cartoonish, especially the motorbike scene at the beginning of the movie, and the jungle sequence (Mutt swinging through the jungle a la Tarzan, monkies attacking the bad guys, and killer ants? Come on, this is not a cartoon!). And what was with the whole jumping the car of the cliff to land on a tree that slowly bends down to land them in the river? I'm sorry, did this just become a fantasy film? And the poor CGI execution doesn't help but add to the cartoonish feel of the movie. That goes completely against the history of the franchise. The whole point of the originals, and how Harrison Ford approached the character, was that this was a hero you could believe in. That was clearly trashed in order to appeal to todays CGI market.Harrison Ford does carry the old Indy swagger well, and it's nice to watch him, but Shia LeBouef is off in his execution of character, while Cate Blanchette and John Hurt play their characters with poor stereotypical traits, and Karen Allen is particularly bad and grating in her scenes, just very poor acting on her part.I'm sure some of that can be put down to the script though. As mentioned before, it's a mismatch, scenes are clearly there to allow for a certain action sequence to take place, or for a joke or reference to previous Indy films to take place, not to actually tell a good story. And at the end, the whole alien thing makes you feel like they just mashed the endings of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Close Encounters of the Third Kind into one. I think having watched this, and Star Wars 1-3 & Clone Wars, it's clear that George Lucas is clearly now out of touch with story telling. All of the franchise movies he's re-visited in the last 8 years have never been near the standard of the originals. Sorry George, but it's true.It's sad. As with seeing teenagers wearing 'Frankie Says Relax' t-shirts today, watching this movie makes you realize how good the originals were, but also angry that someone is trying to cash in on your child hood memories by imitating them now so they can be sold to today's kids as something brand new. And, just like the t-shirts, this movie doesn't hold the same power as the original because the original represented a time and feeling, this just represents the need for a quick buck. Indy sold his soul, and all of us 80's kids should be very disappointed by that.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
603,sklose32,A lot better than expected,7,30 May 2008,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" today. There were plenty of bad reviews for sure. So I really went in with pretty low expectations. What was delivered on the other hand, was a solid Indiana Jones movie with all the right ingredients. I will not waste time with telling you the plot again. To be honest, the movie really has everything a fan would expect. A lot of action, some comedy, memorable bad guys (or bad girls in this case). My only beef with the movie is that it sometimes tried to do a bit too much. There are things happening in this movie where you kinda think ""No way in hell"". I know, that we kind of expect that from this kind of movie but some stuff was really out there. It was also nice to see Karen Allen again. Without telling you anything about the movies plot I can safely say, that if you liked the first three outings you will like this one too.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
604,Grant_Price,Fridges were built to last in those days,2,25 May 2008,"Do you remember a few years back when George Lucas, in his infinite wisdom, decided to revive one of the best loved movie franchises of all time and proceeded to turn the result into a waking nightmare for all those who saw it? 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is like that. Multiplied by ten. It is so diabolically awful that in a perfect world it would ensure neither George Lucas nor Harrison Ford have anything to do with film again. Unfortunately as THE most anticipated movie of the year people will flock to see it in droves, allowing Lucas total freedom to write and push into production the next sequel, tentatively titled 'Mutt Jones in the Hunt for Hitler's Missing Comb' in which Henry Jones Jr Jr must find the comb Hitler used prior to his appearance at the 1938 Nuremburg Rally in order to style his hair perfectly in time for prom night and the chance to get laid.I believe the shortcomings of KOTCS can be summarised in one line, describing an act which occurs during the film's main 'action' sequence: Shia Labeouf (playing an arriviste greaser called Mutt) summons a CGI monkey army in the Amazon rainforest and swings with them on vines through the trees fast enough to catch up with a speeding Jeep, at which point he telekinetically unleashes monkey hell on the hapless bad guys driving it while Harrison Ford looks on appreciatively. I'm not making this up. It is difficult to think of something that stupid.For those requiring further persuasion of how awful KOTCS is, why not take a look at Harrison Ford's so-called 'acting' as he is clearly unable to do anything approaching the definition of that word. His delivery of lines sounds akin to the bit-part detective Michael Madsen played in Sin City, except he was sounding stilted and awkward on purpose. Of course, it doesn't help that the majority of the script has been garnished with a munificent helping of cheese, but that didn't hinder Ford in any of the original Star Wars films did it? Although, come to think of it, there WAS a line from Star Wars in the film. This is because George Lucas is a total idiot.Need further proof? How about Cate Blanchett turning in a career low performance, or Ray Winstone, superfluous and ridiculous as usual? What about the final scene and Steven Spielberg's perplexing choice to bathe it entirely in a sterile white light? Then there's the unwelcome appearance of ET, the apropos of nothing nuclear explosion, the laughably non-dramatic prologue, and the constant allusions to the amazing feats Indy accomplished or witnessed in the twenty years since we last saw him, which makes one wonder why the story wasn't based around one of those events. Instead we receive a mélange of underdeveloped ideas linked together in the most tenuous way possible, desperately disguised with poor special effects and John William's classic score.A couple of performances stand out from the drudgery. Sean Connery as a photograph is particularly nuanced, showing off his full range of acting skills. Shia Labeouf (aside from his King of the Jungle tendencies) is actually quite effective and seems to be the only one really enjoying himself. Karen Allen is an interesting case not due to anything she does on screen specifically (she brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'surplus to requirements), but because she shows children how time eventually ravages everything, especially formerly beautiful women. And that's an important moral to learn.Overall, watching the fourth Indiana Jones film is the equivalent of a grinning George Lucas kicking you in the nuts whilst simultaneously setting fire to your cherished childhood movie memories until they become nothing but a sad pile of ashes. How tired and unnecessary is this film? All you have to do is consider a question Mutt asks Indy: ""What are you, like 80?"" Yes he is. Time to give it up.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

606,lukalele,Big disappointment,5,28 May 2008,"Sometimes I know it's a bad idea to go into a film with high expectations, so maybe it's my fault that I didn't enjoy this. I couldn't help it. It's Indy! One of the greatest action film characters in history! Hero of the Ark and the Grail! Liberator of the evil Temple of Doom! What the hell happened? Probably the best bit of this film is where one of the aforementioned objects makes an all-too-brief but very notable appearance, which made me long for movies past, as did the pic and mention of the senior Jones.The action's OK. It's hard to come up with anything original nowadays so we've got armies of huge ants, car chases, hostile natives, sword fights and the like. Standard fare, a bit of CGI, it's all been done before but it's well done here, still it's because it's been done before that compared to the first 3 this one seems to be lacking in imagination. I'd say we're more desensitised to it now, but I can still watch the first 3 films today and enjoy them immensely, way more than I did this film. They're still better than 99% of anything that comes out nowadays. Nothing as exciting as the mine carts in Doom. The characters are good, even though John Hurt's character got more than a little annoying. There's a lot of humour, but somehow it's not as charming as the first 3. I can accept the nuke scene, as I can appreciate the tongue-in-cheek aspect that Indy can survive anything, which I think is the point. That's as far as my positive rating goes, however, as the mysticism and wonder of Raiders and Last Crusade, which made them such great and timeless films, has not made it into this one. The concept and the way it's handled fell flat for me. It just didn't work, and that is the reason I didn't enjoy this. I'm not religious in any way, but who hasn't wondered if the Grail actually exists? Who wasn't awed by the wrath of God when the Ark was opened in Raiders? These are the things that Indy's about. Well, used to be. Not any more. Why didn't they use the Spear of Destiny, or something similar, as the centrepiece? Similar theme, but who cares? Would've worked a lot better, and would've fit with the whole Indy being the ultimate finder of world-changing lost artifacts thing. The lack of imagination abounds throughout the movie with the way our heroes have to deal with the adversities and obstacles thrown at them as well. Seems that simply touching or holding aloft said namesake of the film will get them through almost anything. Way too easy. As a result this film had all but lost me by the climax, unfortunately, and that wasn't going to bring me back either. Ridiculous and unsatisfying.Too bad, this film had a lot to live up to. Footsteps maybe too lofty to follow in, but I still think this could've been a lot better. Sorry Indy, you just don't fit into the 21st century. How things have changed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Spielberg, Ford and Lucas made the right decision to bring back Indiana Jones and this film really did it for me! Once I saw the old 80's paramount logo come up and the first scene started, I was just blown away. The opening sequence in the warehouse (""Area 51"") which was at the end of ""Raiders"" was exciting and excellently directed. Harrison Ford was excellent as usual as his iconic character. Shia Labeouf's character, ""Mutt"" was a great idea to bring into the franchise. The only problem I found was that I didn't find the soviets as menacing as the Nazis were in ""Raiders"" and ""Last Crusade"". The action and stunts were absolutely fantastic, I loved that chase through the jungle, the waterfall scene and the climax! The sci-fi alien Roswell mystery with the crystal skulls really worked for me and because of the setting in the 1950's. Nothing really disappointed me, it was exactly what I expected it to be and I wasn't dreaming up ridiculous story of my own in my head. All I was really thinking was that it was gonna have that Last Crusade kind of feeling and a mixture of all of the first 3 films. Rating 10/10Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford have proved themselves that they could bring back one of the greatest icons in cinema of all time and they have succeeded.

609,heisenberg83,"12 years later, a second viewing and I've changed my mind - I love it !",8,26 May 2008,"I really hated this movie when it originally came out in theatre back in 2008. Looking back, how could I have possibly enjoyed it? I sat in the cinema in ""comparison"" mode, criticising every scene and comparing it in my mind to RAIDERS, DOOM & CRUSADE. This film didn't stand a chance in my mind, because I was tearing it to pieces with comparisons/critique. I guess watching it only for the 2nd time 12 years later in 2020, I just sat with an open quiet clear mind, and decided to just have a good fun time with characters I love. And what a suprise, I really really enjoyed it! In fact, I can't see how I could've hated it so much back in 2008. I guess I myself am 12 years older now, and the themes of aging, losing things and re-finding lost loves appeals much more to my 41 year old self. Knowing Harrison was about 65 when this was made, he is very impressive - doing a lot of the stuntwork himself, the Indy silhouette still cuts as impressive a figure, and Harrison still does the ""determined grit"" expression as good as ever. I couldn't help grinning myself when he says classic Indy lines like ""Don't touch anything!"". There are some rollicking good jaw-dropping action sequences, in particular the openining warehouse fight & the motorcycle chase through the university campus. Some laugh out loud moments which made me chortle, like the unique way of rescuing Indy from the quicksand, the cafe dialogue with Shia, giving the library student tips mid-chase, and Mutt doing hair in the most inappropriate moments. I'm not sure why Shia LaBeouf was so hated in hindsight, I think he does a good job, taking the role seriously and playing it just right. There is the right degree of creepiness and horror too like the killer red ants, and the creepy tombs and tribesmen. I liked that they pay homage to old characters too like Indy's father, Marcus and a ""blink and you'll miss it"" photography of Willie Scott from DOOM. In some ways I feel this movie is closer to the later Indiana computer games than the original movies. If you've played INFERNAL MACHINE, you'll know what I mean. The ""Three Drops"" waterfall sequence is beautiful but a little ludicrous, and I could have done without the Shia monkey swinging, or the random golphers at the beginning. The skull itself is too shiny and ""prop"" looking (compare to drink blood skulls of DOOM which were way creepier) and the UFO plot feels recycled from Close Encounters. But surprisingly, I think this might now be my 3rd favourite Indy movie, since a recent re-watch of LAST CRUSADE I was a little disappointed at the rehash of RAIDERS, and the fake looking sets (although Connery is amazing of course). This movie also looks beautiful on HD television, so colourful, vibrant and panoramic. I enjoyed the Russian/Communist Paranoia new setting of this one, but overall the message of ""you're at the age in life where you start losing things rather than receiving them"" was very touching, and that Indy shows you can find love at any age in life, no matter what. The chemistry between Marion & Indy was still very strong, and I didn't understand why he'd want to be with her when I first watched it 12 years ago, but as an older man, it makes a lot of sense now.

611,mjscarface,A pale shadow of what Indy was all about,5,25 May 2008,"As most other people on here, I loved the first 3 Indy films and consider 'Temple of Doom', previously the weakest to still be a rock solid adventure. I wasn't expecting another 'Raiders' from Spielberg and co. but I was hoping 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' would at least be a worthy Indiana Jones film. It wasn't.Things started off quite well, with the opening scenes building up nicely to the first action sequence. The familiar images of 50s Americana, sprawling landscapes and villainous Russian (replacing the Nazi) soldiers gave me the impression that this would be a winner. Even the ridiculous stunt that ends this sequence didn't stop be enjoying myself.For the first half or so, KOTCS is actually good fun and in the spirit of the other three, with a motorbike chase that combined comedy and fantastic stuntwork in the classic tradition. The chemistry between Ford and Shia LeBeouf works well and keeps things interesting... until about an hour in and the film takes a nosedive.Now, I don't have an issue with the 'subject' of Indy's quest, nor does Indy's age concern me. What I do take issue with is a script that over-explains every plot point to tedious length and throws in silly gags that would be mores suited to 'Pirates' than Indy. Seriously, how the hell thought it would be a good idea to have Shia LeBeouf swinging like Tarzan with an army of monkeys and being able to catch up with a speeding jeep?! And it's not just one or two bad moments that ruin the film, it's the entire script, which is unavoidable AND inexcusable in a series that otherwise is funny and creative. It could NOT have taken 19 years to come up with this mess. And another problem that plagues the entire second act is the acting from John Hurt and Karen Allen, both grinning and laughing throughout what should be the most tense and nail-biting moments of the film. Plus, the romance between Ford and Allen is rushed and virtually redundant, making the ending all the more worse.It's all well and good to say 'It's Indy, not Shakespeare' and that 'You have too high expectations' but this is nowhere near the same level as the others. AND if it wasn't for false promises of minimal CG and the 'new and original' story, it wouldn't be as much of a disappointment. The climax is anything but, and comes off as a poor imitator to Raiders and Close Encounters, with Indy looking on. In fact there's a severe lack of 'Indy moments' in this film and thats a shame, highlighted even more by the awful John Williams score.The set-pieces were OK, but what should have been the 'tour de force' jungle chase, became a CG farce lacking the pace or tension of, say, the Tank Battle or Jeep chase from LC and Raiders.This may seem like some fanboy rant, but like many people I can't believe that this is from the same series that owned the 1980s and the entire adventure genre, or from a director that should have known better. The damn-near flawless trilogy has now been tarnished by a mediocre homage/parody that falls short on tension and ideas around the halfway mark.As Sallah would say, 'Sorry Indy...'",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
612,SlackerRus2000,Indy should never have come out of retirement,5,23 June 2008,"I had never seen any of the Indian Jones films. Once this movie started nearing it's opening day I started getting the media blitz fever. So I bought the bullet and watch all three movie in sequential order. I have to say the are highly over-rated. Overly long action sequences, no real character development, a kids movie that is a little to highly revered (Raiders of the lost arch top 250 film on IMDb, REALLY?????) . Other movies from the 80s are definitely better, Goonies, labyrinth, etc. Still they are decent, so I was looking forward to the film. It started off good. I enjoyed the dialogue and opening sequence at the military base. I don't know why people were complaining about Indy escaping from a nuclear blast in a refrigerator, ( in the second film they escape a crashing plane by jumping out of it on an inflatable boat, only to land on a river, where they have to survive a 100 foot waterfall drop) seems pretty on par for an Indy film.My main beef with the film was the story it just didn't make sense. Apparently, they returned a skull to these aliens who left on a space ship. But the aliens were together as a group for 500 years before the skull was stolen, why didn't they leave sometime during that period. I seem deus ex machina to me. I bought it all they way until the end, then the story fell flat. They had good supporting facts for their treasure hunt, then it just crumpled into lunacy and pretend crap.Also, I realize people didn't want a lot of cg in the film, cause it would disturb the essence of the series but clearly that didn't happen. I mean if your gonna used cg at least make the action scenes interesting. They literally felt like they were made in the 80s, which I guess is the feeling the were going for. Unfortunately, they just seem uninteresting and boring.1st half of film good + second half boring + Ending terrible = mediocre",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
613,Unlimitedmovies,Lucas and Spielberg...What Were You Thinking?,1,23 May 2008,"My husband is a huge Indiana Jones fan and I love Indy movies too. We had been looking forward to seeing Crystal Skull for months now after seeing the trailers and all the hype about this movie. We went and saw it yesterday with my 25 year old nephew and all three of us were very disappointed. What were George Lucas and Steven Spielberg thinking? I think I was more disappointed in Harrison Ford for accepting this script since it was not high quality. If you decide to see this movie, lower your expectations a lot. It is not up to the excellent standards of the former Indiana Jones movies by a long shot. A few points I want to make.......1. The characters would not have survived the three waterfalls drops and even a movie couldn't make my imagination believe it. If you notice in the last waterfall, how huge they are and how much acreage the waterfalls occupy, but the characters just happen to climb ashore the area right in front of the skull shaped rock.2. Every time the characters are immersed in water, somehow in the next scene they are dry. Especially noted after the characters are shot out of the water ""cannon"" towards the end, and Karen Allen's hair isn't even wet. Mutts hair is never mussed, nor Harrison Ford's hair.3. The scene where Ford and Allen are sinking in the sand did notlook realistic, nor did the snake that they used as a rope.4. In the warehouse scene where the objects were moving towards the box with the Alien in it. Flashback to Poltergeist and the items moving towards the closet. Reused tactics.5. The skull either had crumbled up tin foil or shiny/metallic gift wrap bag tissue paper crunched up and put in the plastic skull. Sometimes when they turned the skull it look so phony. People in the audience actually laughed, yes laughed at the movie when the skull appeared. Didn't anybody bother to edit this movie and look for flaws? Obviously not.6. The romance between Ford and Allen could have been expanded a lot and Indy fans expected a lot more after waiting 19 years for them to reunite. It was so weak and the wedding scene was a let down.My husband and I saw this movie on May 22 and again tonight May 25. The reason we went back was we couldn't believe how bad it was and since it was an Indiana Jones movie felt like we should at least go back and see if we missed something. We didn't. I was saddened because there were a lot of people there tonight since it is a work holiday tomorrow on Memorial Day, and people were actually laughing AT the film in places. Seriously, laughing at the movie, especially when the skull appeared and during the goofy, alien, skull, spaceship nonsense.This was not a good script. I am so disappointed that Harrison Ford accepted it and that Spielberg and Lucas turned it into some silly alien movie. Huge Letdown. When we walked out of the theater my nephew and I both had a tear in our eyes for my husband. He was so looking forward to this film and my husband tried to stay positive and upbeat but we could tell he was terribly letdown. He has bought all of the Indiana Jones action figures; been collecting them for a long time. Thank God he didn't buy any of the Crystal Skull crap. And as a last note: I think its unfair that Lucas and Spielberg will make a ton of money off this movie and the toys, action figures, etc...They did not put a lot of effort into the script or the movie itself and it makes me mad that they are profiting off this poor excuse for a film. And I can see the 5th sequel now for their next money making Indy film though I won't go see one of their films again....Indiana Jones will help his son solve the grassy knoll question and they will be looking for some locked file with secrets from the Kennedy assassination.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
614,maccaveili,First big summer letdown,3,25 May 2008,"I felt I was being generous by even giving it 3 stars out of 10 to be honest. How much longer will Hollywood put out movies where multiple people shooting machine guns at one person on the run from merely 30 yards away continue to just barely miss the hero of the film. Equally as annoying was how often all the action stopped to let one of the films 3 biggest stars fit in yet another one-liner....hardy har har. Maybe it's just me, but I cannot believe that Spielberg released something like this, he's one of my favorite directors after all. I don't recall hearing anyone in the packed theater I was in chuckle, oooh or even ahhh once the entire time. This movie is on par with Jurassic Park 3 and T3....in other words, just living off the fame of the preceding movies in the series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
615,Cinemadharma,Kill me now. Please. Put me out of my misery.,2,11 July 2009,"The experience of seeing this film is like getting really excited about seeing your favorite uncle who you haven't seen since you were a kid, and then seeing him... and realizing that he's turned into a total dick. And even though it is kind of good to lay your eyes on him again, you really wish he had stayed away so you could just remember him as he was back in the day.I knew from the moment I saw this steaming pile of dung that Spielberg was most likely responsible for anything good in it (a non-CG motorcycle stunt sequence, and um... ah... um...) and Lucas was definitely responsible for everything that sucked (gophers, Mutt as Tarzan, zero character development, totally wussifying and domesticating Marion, gophers, wasting talented actors with a horribly Frankensteined script, doing everything possible CG, turning Indy into a completely inconsequential secondary character - most likely so he could build up Mutt to take over and keep the franchise going as far past it's expiration date as possible (like Star Wars), and close encounters with gophers for a third time in case you missed them the 1st two times.) Lucas is a malicious droid nosferatu who has sucked the element of human soul from everything he has touched since the 90's and will not return to his coffin to rest until he has remade every good or decent film he has made at least 3 times, replacing every human with a computer generated effect; every prop or set made by human hands replaced by a digital effect in 3-D Smell-O-Vision; every creature 'Brought to Life' by Stuart Freeborn, Rick Baker, Phil Tippet, Frank Oz, etc... photoshopped out of existence to be replaced with glossy, lifeless, video game avatars nobody cares about; basically - this massacre of celluloid and pillaging of our childhood will continue until every piece of film he created is burned and every memory we have of the real adventure, excitement, imagination, mythology and characters we cared about have been reduced to the empty soullessness of a pixel.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
616,StuJM,Lacks the Indy magic feel,4,3 June 2008,"To start with, I am a fan of the last 3 Indy films and even after the Star Wars Prequals, I went into the cinema expecting this film to make up for the disappointment of Lucas's last adventure into film making. Sadly, it wasn't to be. If the 3 Star Wars prequels was a let down, this really destroyed any faith I have in George Lucas now.What made Raiders of the Lost Ark & The Last Crusade is what they was built on. Indiana Jones is historical based film, and both Raiders & Crusade have Historical facts around which the plot is made and to which makes it relevant to Indy & his job/hobby. KotCS has none of this, the plot is paper thin and its so ill thought out that I forgot what they was actually doing with the Skull. The Russains appear to have little interest in the Skull other then to play the bad guys to Indy's protagonist, and what there is isn't exactly explained in length or detail. Other then Indy, I cant say I was too fond of his support, Mutt is the same would-be apprentice/helper from any adventure film (glimemrs of Hayden Christenson's Vader in the SW films) and wasn't easy to warm too, while Karen Allen arrives quite late with little reason to be there. I also couldn't figure what Ray Winstone's role was other then for comic relief, and I don't think Lucas actually knew anymore then I did.But its the action sequences that let it down for me. Usually a highlight in any Indy film, this one was marred with Lame CGI and images so bad & cheesy I wanted to cry. Im sure somewhere, sometime when George wrote this it seemed like a good idea but it just didn't excite me as when Indy is battling Nazi's on a Tank in a desert canyon. In particular its Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett (both conveniently good swordsman BTW) duelling over 2 speeding jeeps in the jungle, and equally as bad was when Mutt ""Tarzan swings"" with a group of Monkey ""allies"". None of these however, even get near the biggest crime of the film, which is the finale and what the Skull is all about. Honestly it ruins everything that was even good in the film, and it so laughable, its just untrue.When it was announced Indy 4 was being made, Il admit I was excited and nervous (from the SW prequels) but I had hoped Spielberg might have kept Lucas under control. But it wasn't to be. The CGI looks awful, even compared to Revenge of the Sith, which fault ridden as it was, had some amazing eye-candy effects, there's too many cringe moments (gopher's at the beginning, the Jungle battle) and not enough Indy magic. There are some good moments in the film, the beginning is enjoyable and Ford plays Indiana like only he can. But the good is few and far between, and while its an enjoyable film, its not a good one and its certainly not a good Indiana Jones film. I managed to watch National Treasure 2 the day before, and its everything Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull should have been, Good fun, enjoyable and a decent film to watch.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
617,MovieCriticDave,"An ""Indy"" movie in title only....",4,1 January 2009,"Story was that, when approached about joining the cast for this 4th Indiana Jones installment, Sean Connery said ""no"" presumably due to his retirement.After watching ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" I think Connery was being polite.Tortured by uneven pacing, a patently ridiculous story, a laughably bad Russian accent by Kate Blanchett, and an underlying sense that the ensemble is together more for the sake of sentimentality than production, ""Skull"" is a movie that diminishes the legacy of the original Indiana Jones trilogy and hopefully guarantees there won't be a fifth.We can only hope.""Skull"" represents a papier-mache shell of the original Indy franchise, turning Ford's character into a caricature of itself, thinner than the celluloid on which this offering is filmed. Even Ford himself seems to be going through the motions at times, delivering forced humor, playing a strawman character that only incidentally happens to be sporting a whip and wearing a fedora. At one point, Indy bemoans the ""loss"" of his friend Marcus (played by the late Denholm Elliot) and his dad, and you can't help but wonder if he isn't really bemoaning the lack of a relevant part for himself just as much.And that, more than anything else, is the core problem with ""Skull."" Indiana Jones isn't essential to this movie. Any one-dimensional comic book hero could have been plugged into this script and played the same part with almost no change to the film's core story. In ""Raiders,"" Jones core irascibility made him the only man who could simultaneously fight the Nazis and claim the Ark; in Skull, he's just someone who occasionally cracks a whip and smirks knowingly. The subtle magic that distinguishes the movie as being a true volume in the Indy saga is simply nonexistent.If you believe much of the Internet banter about this movie, you know it took years for story and schedules to merge in a way that allowed a fourth Indiana Jones movie to become reality. Ford is twenty years removed from his Jones heyday, but still a screen icon arguably redefining his own roles in later years as Connery did his; and no matter what genius may be behind the story, genius can't be brought to bear on a whim. Ultimately, ""Skull"" plays like the worst result of those variables, an offering thrown together by the relevant players while there was still time to make a relevant ""Indy"" movie, with many of the cast just going through the motions. It makes one wonder how the likes of a Steven Spielberg could mishandle the franchise so badly.When the previous Jones movie ended, our heroes were allowed the outlandish send off of literally riding off into the sunset, and the outlandishness befit the story. Sadly, ""Skull"" translates that image into a crashing head-scratch of ""what was that?"" What a pity.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
618,missmissa,"Good, fun, but it's no Raiders",8,22 May 2008,"I'll be honest, I wasn't born when Raiders of the Lost Ark came out in theatres, but I've been watching it ever since I've been alive. Indy, to me, is better than Han Solo, which is why I was willing to go to a Midnight showing of this film. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't overly impressed either.First, the style is a little off. The director of photography, Douglas Slocombe, from the first three has retired (he's in his nineties) and that left Janusz Kaminski struggling to retain what Slocombe had created, and he didn't always make it work. It was a little jarring to see Harrison Ford in the fedora, but in a different light than what I'm used to. Also part of the beauty of the originals was how much stuff was just real. There were just a few too many matte shots that weren't composited as well as they should have been. I mean, doesn't George Lucas own ILM, the premier effects house in the world? I expected better.It also appears they let the advancement in technology over the last 19 years go to their heads a little bit. Some of the action set ups are a little over the top, even for Indy, and they wouldn't have been possible until recently.For the most part, I love the cast. Blanchett is a formidable villain, who's likable in her own villainous way. And as much as I love Ray Winstone as an actor, I could have done without his character, partially because his English was harder to understand than the Russians. Shia LeBeouf is great as Indy's main sidekick and Karen Allen still retains her spark and spunk from the original. William Hurt is fantastic as an archaeologist who's lost his marbles. But all of these characters and a pretty complicated plot take away from something very important: Indy himself. It almost felt like our hero had been sidelined in favor of everyone else.It might sound like I didn't like the movie, but that's not true. Overall, it was well written, well acted, well made, and it was a ton of fun. It's one of the best movies this year, so far anyway.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
619,Boromir28,George Lucas - the destroyer of worlds,5,20 June 2008,"From 1981 to 1989 the world saw the best action hero ever to emerge on screen since the first Bond film in 1962. Then 19 years passed and in between there were rumors that the Man in Fedora and Bull Whip would return and we ALL collectively jumped in the air of joy....Then what happens....George Lucas and his constant need for bad dialog, CGI excess and fury-fuzzy animals that are downright annoying. What was great about the first three movies was STORY first and effects second. You were really drawn into the story by the slow-paced (yes slow-paced) dialog scenes where the premise for the story were set up, and then you were ready for the adventure.There are virtually NO dialog-set up scenes in Skull and you really feel the half hearted explanation as to why the skull is so important unfullfilling and useless. The first half of the movie is actually great and have high entertainment value and some good one-liners. Perticularly the motor bike chase through the university library is GREAT fun and very in tune with the wicker basket chase scene in Raiders and the speed boat chase in Crusade. It works because of the editing which is really the only time it comes close to the first three and because of the interaction between Indy and the young rebel Mutt (LeBeauf) who looks like a Brando clone from ""The Wild One"" (he has the cap and all), is crisp and brings back the feeling of the Indy/Short Round duo. Indy and Mutt then have to rescue Mutt's pseudo Grandfather Professor Oxley whom Indy studied with in Chicago and Mutt's mother Mary Williams ( a shocker to find it was really Marion Ravenwood ALL ALONG).The characters in this one are no way NEAR the great characters of past Indy films: Sallah, Marcus and of course Professor Henry Jones, Sr. Only Lebeauf's Mutt seems to have been given the care that it deserves.Karen Allen(whom I found annoying back in Raiders) manages to double that annoyance by substandard acting and constant giggling in face of almost certain death. I blame Spielberg for that one, always wanted to bring Marion back, even for no. 2. Karen Allen is just not that good an actress.Oxley played by the otherwise great John Hurt, is reduced to a speaking version of Lassie. He holds the great secret to the success of their mission but has lost his marbles by meddling too much with the skull, and Indy is the only one who can interpret his ramblings, and is rather annoying: again Lucas!!!!Mac played by Ray Wintone is a character that never really makes sense. He is apparently and old friend of Indy's but double-crosses him two or three times during the movie for no other purpose than gold, and STILL Indy tries to save him in the end.Spalko,( Cate Blanchet) the Russian Übervillain is flat and does not come across as a potential threat to Indy like Elsa Schneider was in Crusade.The Indy franchise has by now become larger than life and is one of the reasons why the movie doesn't reach it's full potential. Look at Raiders, practically only Harrison Ford was by then a known name to the wide cinema going world, the rest of the actors were found in small film venues or from the stage, and it gave the room for Harrison Ford to shine as the star he is and as the true hero Indy is( Crusade being the exception with Connery, but he was necessary as only he could tell Indy to finish his dinner, so to speak, and to do it realistically). In Skull there are all of a sudden too many ""names"" that are crowding the screen and it results in a group adventure rather then an Indy adventure. There are some GREAT humoristics in Skull and some nice references to the previous films that will excite the fans, but they are few....I have spoken at length about this film, mostly negative, but you have to see it anyway as it IS Indiana Jones. Just remember that none of the actors(Karen Allen excepted) are to blame for the rather many mishaps. Even Spielberg aren't so much a villain as victim...it ALL comes down to George Lucas - the destroyer of worlds.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
620,cmtaylor-10993,Not as bad as people make out.,7,10 June 2021,"I remember getting caught up in all the hype prior to this film getting released and as a 20 year old, this was the first opportunity I had to see Indian Jones on the big screen and I loved it.Sure it was full of those familiar Spielberg moments that litter practically all of his films but generally it ticked a lot of the boxes for what an Indiana Jones movie should be.It features a great cast, with Jim Broadbent as fine addition as the new head of the university department. Ray Winstone was a decent henchman and Kate Blanchett a satisfying villain. Retrospectively speaking, Shia Labeof's inclusion as Mutt has probably had a negative effect on the film, but at the time I thought his performance was very worthy and I actually failed to realise that it was the same child actor from Even Stevens.The weakest element is by far the plot. They probably only brought Karen Allen's Marion back to the franchise to anchor this film to the original and I didn't really buy the whole Mutt as Indy's son. It was sort of unnecessary, but I guess it could have opened the franchise up for a potential spin off. I recall the Mummy films did something similar with their 3rd entry by introducing a younger adventurer.The other weak link is the reliance on CGI. Some of it worked but a lot of it didn't. The monkey's are probably the low point of the film and completely unnecessary.I know some fans didn't appreciate the extra terrestrial elements to this movie as it was too far fetched. These fans must have forgotten that the original trilogy was hardly realistic.The best thing about this film is the return of Harrison Ford, and I'm so pleased that the script nicely respects that he is a fair but older than he once was. Harrison is simply fantastic in this role, playing the character perfectly. I also appreciate the fact that the timeline has moved on from the 40s and into the 50s. Does this mean Indy 5 will be in the 70s?The sad thing about this film is the amazing potential it had. It's a real shame that Sean Connery didn't reprise his 2nd most famous role, as him and Ford were a great double act. I do wonder, what the film would have looked like if Spielberg and Lucas had handed the reigns to a younger team with fresh ideas, as the overall plot is really cliche and weak. That said, without Lucas and Spielberg, would Ford have actually signed up?This film is far from perfect but it it's no where near as terrible as people make out. Some of the recent reviews for the 4K boxset are really laughable with people boycotting the boxset simply because this movie is included. I do think that this films reputation will only improve with the passage of time. Controversially the original trilogy has it's low points and the Temple of Doom is my least favourite out of all the movies. I think high expectations fueled by childhood nostalgia are the reason why this film disappointed many fans.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
621,jhobdell,Great in places,6,22 May 2008,"I think 6/10 may be a little harsh, but over all I did find this quite disappointing. The opening sequence left a lot to be desired, and the introduction of Indy was overly built up and then totally disappointing. The CGI gophers that crop up in the first part of the story are laughable (and not in a good way!) The effects weren't up to scratch either, I didn't think. In retrospect, the first half hour or so of the film did not bode well for the rest of the story, which is a pity as it picks up quite well.Once Indy is on his own ground (i.e. in his traditional outfit AND doing some actual investigative archaeology) the film comes into its own. The effects improve, the action really kicks in and a number of reliable elements return (most notably the car chase on the cliff tops).I found the car/motorbike chase quite amusing as Indy steps into his father's shoes as the disapproving older man! Harrison Ford is in good form and there are star turns from Jim Broadbent and John Hurt. Everyone else left me feeling flat though, and Spielberg has definitely gone soft in his old age: the final scene is as ruinous as the tie-up at the end of Minority Report.It's entertaining enough, but I doubt you'll contradict my view that it comes nowhere near the standard of the originals.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
622,tonysharp,"A little sloppy, but not worth nitpicking.",5,26 May 2008,"Everyone thinks they're Roger Ebert now. While reading through the reviews here and on other sites I see a lot of quotes like ""the first thing to be examined ---"", or ""there was too much CG ---"", or ""this character should have been ---"", and so on.The Indiana Jones movies, like most blockbusters, are not abstract pieces of high-art meant for ""examination"". They're roller-coaster rides; plan and simple. You're suppose to strap yourself in, turn off your brain, and just go for the ride. However, I must admit, even a roller coaster ride can do an unexpected jerk that can distract you from the good times.Spielberg and Lucas are a couple of creative madmen. Who else could have conceived, or even attempted to pull off, some of the weirdness that is seen in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? I don't think I could. Most people can't, and this is what makes Spielberg and Lucas such a special team.Being a creative madman has it's drawbacks. The Positive: You'll be able to come up with moments that have never been seen in the same way before. The Negative: Sometimes you'll push a few things a little too far; Kingdom of the Crystal Skull definitely does this a few times.But the notorious, absurd, and completely unnecessary refrigerator scene, and a few other scenes, were not enough to destroy the experience for me.

623,XFLRWF,No years or mileage can slow down Jones,8,25 May 2008,"Death-defying escapes, high impact action, and that familiar fedora are back in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" The creative and imaginative team of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg deliver another epic adventure of the infamous, globe-trotting archaeologist that is sure to win over fans of the series and gain a new generation of Indy followers. After a near 20 year absence, Harrison Ford returns in the role of Dr. Jones and proves that neither the years nor the mileage slow him down. Adding their own flair to the series' historic aura are Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett as Indy's newest sidekick and nemesis, John Hurt, and Karen Allen. The old school and new blood mix create a high adrenaline ride that takes your breath away.The year is 1957. America is in the middle of the Cold War and Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is kidnapped to a military base to find a hidden artifact by Russian scientist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett). After making his traditional daring escape, Jones makes his way back to his university where he encounters greaser Mutt Willaims (Shia LaBeouf). Williams informs Indy that an old colleague (John Hurt) of his has been missing while trying to find the treasure of the crystal skull. While trying to dodge Communists, booby traps, and other hazards that are just a typical day at the office for Jones, Indy must find his friend and return the crystal skull to its proper place.Spielberg has never lost his touch for storytelling and action sequences and ""Crystal Skull"" is no different. He draws in the audience completely by fully capturing every breath-taking stunt and hard-hitting fight while giving the audience just enough time to catch their breath. It is in Spielberg's willingness to not hold anything back that is one component that makes ""Crystal Skull"" successful. His close-ups of every Indy exploit and thoughtful moment make the audience feel they are right along side on this latest adventure. Indy aficionados will also note Spielberg's similar camera styles that he has used introduce scenes in the previous Indy films.As most fans of the series know, Indiana Jones was one of the ideas conceived by George Lucas as homage to the Saturday matinée movie serials he saw as a child. (The other was some space movie that has also done well.) In ""Crystal Skull"", Lucas and screenwriters David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson take the vision to new heights. They trio is keenly aware of what the audience wants and expects from an Indiana Jones film and delivers that on all levels. They fill in the audience on the gap between finding the Holy Grail to 1957 and throw in a fantastic plot that Lucas' must have dreamt of since he was a boy watching the serials. Some fans may find the story a bit too eccentric, even for Jones. But the Indy has been fighting the unbelievable for years. Unlike James Bond and other indestructible cinematic characters, Indiana Jones does and has aged. One of the writers' great achievements is aging Indy in mind and body but keeping him young in spirit.From the moment we see the shadow of Indiana Jones donning the fedora; we immediately wait on the presence of Harrison Ford. Ford has not lost a step in playing the iconic character. He is as smart and witty as he has ever been as Jones and can still throw a mean punch. But Ford also knows that the character has aged too and portrays Indy as tough but also reflective on what he has missed in life. In his scenes with Shia LaBeouf's Mutt Williams, Ford has taken on the father figure role. But while older than his counterpart, he still has a thing or two to teach him. Like many actors who have reprised roles, Ford fits into Indy like an old pair of shoes. Shia LeBeouf adds a tough and comic side in his performance as Mutt Willaims. For the role, LeBeouf seems to have really studied up on 1950's biker movies. He is the quintessential greaser: constantly concerned about combing his hair and riding his motorcycle. And yet, he is smart enough to not overplay that characteristic. LaBeouf knows when to play it up for laughs and when to do the role seriously. LaBeouf and Ford share great chemistry in their student/teacher relationship. It is in this relationship that LaBeouf resembles a younger Indy: headstrong and always ready for a fight. Cate Blanchett is absolutely cold and evil as the villainous Irina Spalko. She plays the role as an absolutely no-nonsense soldier who will kill anyone to get her way. Blanchett's ruthlessness is felt in every scene she occupies and really goes out of her way to make herself a hated villainess. John Hurt and Karen Allen lend their talents in their limited yet effective roles. As the mad Professor Oxley, Hurt really plays his insanity to the hilt. Allen and Ford pick up their banter right where they left off that it doesn't seem any time has passed between finding the Ark of the Covenant and the current hunt for the crystal skull.""Crystal Skull"" does not disappoint in delivering what Indy fans have waited so long for. It has great loads of action and terrific performances. The story does have some incredible elements but lest we forget, the series has always focused on the unusual and bizarre. Indy fans and action lovers in general will have experienced a roller coaster after viewing this film. Nazis, death cults, not even time can stop the force that is Indiana Jones.Grade: A-",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
624,TheDoomSong,An overall disappointing Sequel,3,23 May 2008,"I have been a huge fan of Indiana Jones since i was a little kid. I watched the movies when i was around 9 years old and have watched them over and over again many times after that. I even got into these god awful books when i was a little older, written by Rob MacGregor and Wolfgang Hohlbein and so on, dealing with Indy and Stonehenge, the Easter Islands, the Oracle of Delphi and so on. Since i am a bit older now, 25, i am not a fanatic anymore, but i still love the trilogy dearly and was very impressed with the DVD box release. You can understand that i was pretty excited about this movie being made and went to the movies yesterday with a lot of anticipation. Everybody knows that anticipation can be a very dangerous thing. So dangerous in fact that George Lucas felt obligated to say in an interview that people should not expect too much. It was just a movie. Anyway, i didn't go to the cinema to see how they managed to mess it up. I wanted it to be good. Really, really good! Although i liked the opening scene, capturing both the decade the movie plays in and the Indy-feeling with a trek through the desert, i pretty much knew that i would not be exalted in the end about 15 minutes into the film. Call me old fashioned, but after a 19 years hiatus between the last Indy-film and this one, i would have loved a cooler introduction to our hero, especially because they already gave the scene away in the trailer. I'm not gonna ramble about everything i disliked, but i feel that a couple of things that went really wrong have to be mentioned. I therefore will limit my nagging down to three points: 1. The Villains: At no point in the movie you get the feeling that the Russian army is on Indy's heels. It's merely a crazy Russian lady (Blanchet with her worst acting to date, and the most ridiculous fake accent since Costner in Robin Hood) who, for some unknown reason, thinks that she can read minds. The explanation of her, acting in Lenins name, or at least fulfilling his dream, is so unbelievable and forgettable, that she does never develop a real character and stays a shadowy figure till the end of the movie. Her handful of Russian soldiers and their honcho seem like a bunch of outcasts who have been expelled from Russia for believing in crap like a crystal skull. I don't even wanna mention Mac, the double-wobble-triple agent, who JUST WANTS SOME GOLD! 2. The team of heroes: Clearly wanting to copy the team of the last Indy-movie, this team lacks everything that their predecessors had. While the struggling between the generations worked due to an awesome performance by Connery and Ford, the choice of making Williams Indy's son was a bad one. All the cleverness that went into their teacher-student relation before their blood relationship was revealed is taken away instantly and the fatherly feelings, developing DURING an action scene, are just painful to watch. John Hurt goes home with the price for the most unnecessary character in the movie, babbling something that sounds awfully like a walkthrough guide through an adventure video game. And poor old Marion, being introduced in the last third of the movie, does not much more but being the chauffeur, yelling ""Indy"" to remind us what movie we are watching, and correcting her sons sword fight (wince!). 3. The script: I'm not even gonna try and point out the numerous flaws that this script has, but whereas the previous three Indy movies all used action sequences in order to get the story and Indy from point A to point B, the action in this one seems so arbitrary, not supporting the already weak plot (which is most certainly the worst thing in this Indy movie) at all. When nothing else goes, let's just put some wild natives in there, who live in sealed holes and are simply there to keep the pulse from becoming a flat line. If i had to pick a favorite part of the movie (out of introduction, plot and climax) i'd go for the introduction. Not that it is particularly great, but i rather watch Indiana Jones surviving an atom bomb, than leaving action scenes for LeBeoufs character to take over or watching an alien getting rid of the main villain before blasting of into ""the space between spaces"" (thanks for nothing, David Koepp). How Lucas, Spielberg and Marshall thought this screenplay to be acceptable is completely beyond me. How bad must the other ones have been then?All in all, for me, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a disappointment. My girlfriend who never watched the other movies, enjoyed it pretty much, except from the alien plot line. So i'm not quite sure, how much of my bitterness derives from holding Indiana Jones' other adventures in such high regard.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
625,groovyuniverse,LOW expectations...but what a relief,8,27 August 2012,"Due to all the controversy/outrage i never watched this movie until recently. I did see the first three movies when i was a kid so I was still curious whether this movie was as bad as some of my friends and that notorious South Park episode convinced me it was.Well, luckily it wasn't as bad as i feared. On the contrary, I liked it for having funny ridiculous action scenes, a good pace throughout most of the movie and Harrison Ford being Indy again. Maybe it's because i didn't expect much i liked this movie like i did, could be, just like it could be healthy to not adhere to a movie trilogy like it is religion, unchangeable and sacred.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
626,ffiisshh,Episode IV: The Indiana Menace....Noooooooooo!!!!,1,16 June 2008,"OK. Let me start by saying I did not have very high expectations to begin with going into this one. With all the news about the script constantly being revised to such a major extent, I thought this can only spell disaster. I was right. I just didn't realize how bad it could be until I watched this train wreck for the first time, last night.This was, undoubtedly the most idiotic, childish and over-the-top adventure flick I have seen in a long time. The other Indy flicks, (Which I absolutely loved) had, at their core, at least a plausible intelligent plot, that would carry you through one action scene to the next, in a fun whirlwind of adventure. This one had the most convoluted x-files-esquire story with action that seemed to be derived from very flimsy Ideas at best...Cmon guys, you know you could do better. The CGI was also cheesy, not very believable at all (i.e. the ant scene)and the monkey-laden Chase scene in the jungle,...not to mention the unexplained crazy Hollywood-extra natives living in the pyramid. Oh, and I must not forget Miss Blanchet's wonderful fake Russian accent..OMG...How pathetic.A side note: I noticed that only a few months ago, on IMDb.com, Actor John Hurt was listed as playing the character ""Abner Ravenwood"" (Marion's Dad - who, in ""Raiders"" was mentioned as dead when Indiana returned to Marion in Nepal. First, I think that this would have been infinitely more interesting, and secondly, It shows how poorly the script must have been, that they had to change major characters and plot element s around at the very last minute. This movie felt as if it was assembled on the factory floor with very little heart or thought for the audiences' intelligence. Note to Lucas and Spielburg: We are not THAT dumb....(Yet).To top it all off, I must say, above all else,...Keep your aliens out of My Indy....Nuff said.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
627,mindsclay,Better than the last two,7,29 May 2008,"Although I'd rather George Lucas stop writing, this movie probably wouldn't have been made if he weren't a part of it. Some of the story elements were on the impossible side as far as physics is concerned. Not that I want 100% reality, but come on George, is Indiana Jones a fantasy movie or an adventure movie with a bit of mysticism? I thought this movie was better than the last two Indiana Jones installments. It approached the first one but without the mystery/suspense. Nothing new except there were some great CG effects shots. But hey, it's ILM. I pretty much had the plot figured out mainly because the final outcome is one of those ideas that I had for a script. I have done my research into ancient myths and legends, including the crystal skull, and had come to similar conclusions. Besides that, there were no surprises for me.Some of the fight/action sequences were a bit contrived and dodgy. Yet still in the vein we would expect.I liked it because it was an Indiana Jones movie directed by Steven Spielberg and acted by the always great Harrison Ford. It is a fun movie especially for the Indiana Jones fans. I give it a 7 mainly because they had the money to do a better job with the story. Perhaps they should give some of us newbies a try???",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
628,r_ende,Not as good as the first three movies,7,23 May 2008,"Unfortunately ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is by far not as good as the first three films. The positive things: 1) Although Harrison Ford is already 65 years old, he is still Indiana Jones! The jokes, the action scenes are in the main as good as in the other films. 2) I like the reference in this movie to Marcus Brody and Indy's father (Sean Connery). I also like that Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, who featured already in the first Indiana Jones film, again participates in another Indiana Jones movie. 3) John Williams' music is really excellent! The Raiders March is played several times in different variations and a bit more often than in the first three movies. As I like the Raiders March this is very positive!The negative things: 1) I do not like the story of the film. Some scenes are unfortunately quite confusing. The scene with the ants and especially the scene with the apes are ridiculous. 2) Why does Indy's son always combs his hair???? Simply ridiculous! 3) What have aliens and a starship to do with Indiana Jones? This is not Star Wars!All in all every Indiana Jones fan should have watched this movie but mustn't have high expectations before having watched it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
629,gohurdler1,Hotrods and Space Monkeys.,3,26 May 2008,"SPOILERS!!!!!!What do the majority of George Lucas' films have in common with each other? Hotrods and space monkeys. I think everyone knows that George Lucas is a control freak and that it's pretty much his way or the highway. You all should read the Vanity Fair Article ""Keys to the Kingdom"" about the film, it will give those who have seen the film or haven't seen it some better insight. http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802 Here is a quote from the article that pretty much shows why the story sucked.""So this went on for 15 years,"" he says. ""And finally we got to a point where everybody said, 'Look, we're not doing that movie.' And I said, 'Well, look, I can't think of another MacGuffin. This is it. This works."" Thats a quote from the article and pretty much Lucas was hey it's my crystal skull idea or nothing.Lucas basically came up with the idea for a fourth Indiana Jones while shooting ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" in 1993. He told Ford and Spielberg about the idea and they weren't ""so hot on the idea."" So the movie was finally made after an acceptable script was written.The story idea sucked and the big chase scene with the monkeys was pretty fake looking too. Sorry Shia LaBeouf having his legs spread out like a prima ballerina between two vehicles and having vegetation whack his nards along the way was lame. The swinging through the vines like Tarzan, was again lame and too CGIish. Spielberg appears to be on a LaBeouf love fest and he seems to want to stick him in whatever movie he can.I am not sold on LaBeouf as Indiana Jones the III. He just doesn't have the Indy look and his Mutt character with the wannabee Marlon Brando look was way too much of a flamer. At least they actually didn't pass the Indy fedora to him at the end of the film. Hell I would have bought Matt Damon as Indy's kid.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
630,bigbillyt,Makes Me Sad,4,29 May 2008,"The fine members here on IMDb have already said everything that needs to be said about the specifics of why this film is unworthy as a sequel. By the way, it is not particularly entertaining either.Just to get my two cents in, the comments of many of the folks that say they did enjoy this movie makes me sad. I just feel like the crap that is being pawned off on the viewing public has really sunk to such a low level that people will pay to see very sub-standard fare and like it. The number of reviews and posts on the message board where someone says something like ""people who didn't like this movie are a bunch of fan-boy, haters, nit-pickers, cynical, hyper-critical, blah blah blah, and etc."" are very disturbing. In other words, rather than articulating their counterpoint why those who are negative are wrong, they just say that there is something wrong with them, er me, er us.I think the viewing public has been made to accept anything with some wild action sequences as good entertainment and that is sad. They no longer seems to care at all about a good story. I am sorry, but I want to be motivated by decent story telling to be interested in what happens to the characters. That is what makes the action engaging in the first place.Of course it is especially sad to see guys that used to seem to care about what they did sell out.I will watch my DVDs of the first and third movies again to get this bad taste out of my mouth.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
631,GrandpaBunche,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Unnecessary Sequel,4,2 June 2008,"Don't fall for the hype. I've certainly seen far worse films, but this strictly-for-the-money entry adds little to the Indy franchise and I'd bet it's only been welcomed as much as it has solely because it's a new Indy flick and the fans are so hungry for any new meat that they'll accept just about anything. That said, I did go into it with absolutely zero expectations thanks to my outright loathing of the last installment in the series  1989's execrable INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE  and as a result of that mindset I may have been more forgiving of the new film's faults than I would have otherwise;the movie is by no means a great film, but it is an acceptable time-waster and I didn't hate it for three primary reasons:1. Harrison Ford is back in form and he definitely is the Indy we know, love, and root for, world-weary and exhaustedly resigned as ever. Good to have him back, and I like that they acknowledged his age; after the movie I asked a friend who's a doctor for her medical assessment of how many times Indy would have died from injuries sustained during the story, especially when taking his age into account, and she stated at least eight.2. The return of Marion. Though she wasn't given much to do other than do a little bit of sniping at Indy and smile like a loon while mooning over him, I felt very strongly that she was one of the major factors that made RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK as good as it was and her presence would have elevated the film even if it was INDIANA JONES AND THE DISCOUNT MATTRESS SALE. I'm even willing to bet I wouldn't have hated LAST CRUSADE as much as I did if Karen Allen were in it (I'll be totally honest and admit I've been in love with her since I was thirteen and first saw her as Katey in ANIMAL HOUSE). I totally bought Marion and Indy having broken up and carrying a mutual torch, and it made my heart light to see their obvious affection for one another, an affection that finally gets to express itself again. Even if this is the final Jones flick I'll be satisfied because the hero not only got the girl once and for all, he got the best girl once and for all. 3. Much to my surprise I liked Indy's son, Mutt (played by Shia LeBeuf), quite a lot. He'll never replace Indy, but he is okay and can most definitely hold his own in a fight, with fists or swords. Plus I like that he named himself Mutt while his dad took his moniker from the family dog. Nice touch. And while Shia LeBeuf's other roles have seen him in the kind of parts that make me want to punch his face in like it was an overripe cantaloupe, he's the polar opposite of irritating here, but despite the rumblings of possibly launching a series with him taking over as Indy's successor I think it would be a monumentally bad idea to place the franchise upon Mutt. Part of the audience believing in Jones as strongly as it does hinges upon him being clearly seasoned by years of both practical experience and decades of hardcore study, and Mutt has neither, being barely out of his teens and never having finished school. So if they do give the adventures of Mutt Jones a green light, it would probably be advisable to show him gaining some hard-earned wisdom during the course of his exploits, along with him bagging copious amounts of late-1950's/early-1960's tail as possible. The screen needs more than James Bond hogging up all the chicks, so I say why not turn the son of Indiana Jones loose? His dad found his way into many a tight, secret place, so why not Mutt?But as for the things I didn't really care for, my quibbles are relatively minor: I'm sick of fifties-style commie bad guys with ""moose and squirrel"" accents, and I didn't feel the sci-fi angle fit in well with the Jones ethos; while Arthur C. Clarke's assertion that there's no difference between magic and a sufficiently high level of technology may hold, the sci-fi didn't fill me with the same sense of wonder as the Ark or the Sankara stones (I won't even mention the Grail because it looked a wooden egg cup). Indiana Jones' adventures into the fantastic and arcane invariably bring faith, Judeo-Christian and otherwise, into the mix and while the era has shifted into the 1950's, the time when UFO's entered into the American popular consciousness and culture, the alien tech and unknowable mystery thereof didn't hit me in the same way that the power of deities did, but maybe that just because I'm a lifelong mythology/legends geek (always remember, kiddies: one man's religion is another man's mythology). But what the hell do I know? the sci-fi angle may work for you, so bon appetit.If this is indeed the final adventure of Indiana Jones then so be it, and when all is said and done at least it wasn't as bad as it could have been, although I can honestly say that my movie-going life would have been totally unaffected had I chosen to give it a miss.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

633,mfmoore-1,Why did they make a movie about Indiana Jones Sr?,1,4 August 2015,"Basic reminder of who Indiana Jones is, since George Lucas seemed to forget...1. Indiana Jones is NEVER OUT OF HIS ELEMENT. He knows every custom and culture, speaks seemingly every language and isn't intimidated by anyone. He's got friends in every seedy bar. He knows the truth behind every urban legend. Drop him anywhere on the planet and he'll adapt and survive.Indy's Father is never in his element. He is socially awkward, even with his family. He doesn't intimidate anybody. 2. Indiana Jones is REMORSELESS. Indy has a code of honor to be sure, but make no mistake, he is a thief and a killer. He steals golden idols from ignorant natives, kills Nazis and pagans by the dozen, and has never lost a wink of sleep over it. Indy's Father is remorseful is highly judgmental. He disapproves a murder and theft, and constantly reminds his son of this. If he kills anyone it is practically by accident.3. Women THROW THEMSELVES at Indiana Jones. Whether you are talking his students, his colleague's daughters, his colleagues themselves, or random women he meets; women chase after Indiana Jones like giant boulders. Indy just hits it and quits it. There is no other way to say it. He ditched Marion twice. Once when she was a love lost teen, and again when she was apparently pregnant. You never heard of Willy Scott again, but he probably ditched her halfway to Delhi. Women hit and quit Indy's father. He's not without his charm, but has no real sex appeal. The idea of young women chasing after him seems suspicious at best.4. Indy DOESN'T NEED ANYONE. He is a loner. He has friends and sidekicks, but they are generally useless dead-weight he has to drag to safety.Indy's father is a dead-weight. He is constantly putting his faith in the wrong people, and has to be drug to safety on the back of a motorcycle. Not useless to be sure, but you can't see him doing much without help.Indiana Jones is Rick Blaine with a bullwhip. Indy's father is John Steed with osteoporosis.That's who was screen in this film. Harrison Ford was playing his dad from Last Crusade.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
634,mt7176,Indiana likes Ike!,8,24 May 2008,"I love what Indiana says to the communists when they say, ""What do you have to say, Dr. Jones,"" and he responds in a grizzly voice, ""I like Ike."" Classic moment in this film. There were a lot of great moments in this film and it certainly had the potential for being great...unfortunately, the film falls short or greatness. I have a feeling even Indiana may have been a victim of the writers strike or a quickly approaching release date. The Jones film of the past seem better developed in both story and character. The previous films were more emotionally attached to the audience. I didn't care much for the sci-fi angle but hey its Indiana Jones so its not a big deal and outside of that there was nothing else that I did not like. I thought Harrison Ford was back in top form. I thought the fun frivolities of the past films were present. There was a nice homage to characters who didn't make it into this film. I thought Shia LeBouf did a good job taking on the mantle of the new Henry Jones in the family. All that was missing was a more developed adventure. What you get in its place is a series of stunts that more or less have been seen in other films, including previous Indiana Jones films. I would like to have seen the drama between Marian, Mutt and Indy play out more, in a style that mirrors the father- son relationship of the ""Last Crusade.""Now please don't miss understand, I do not dislike the stunts. By all mean keep them in there, just in addition to, that is all. The chase scene on the motorcycle as well as the chase scene in the jungle were both entertaining. The one in the jungle was definitely humorous with their little homage to Tarzan. I thought what this film got 100% right through all the action scenes was displaying the similar family traits between Jones the senior and Jones the junior. I think if they do continue the series then this film definitely could be the beginning of the process of passing the torch to the son. So with all that could have been and wasn't, and the fact that this film places 4th among Indy movies, it will be added to my video collection and it will be watched numerous times. Its good to see Indy back and heres to making more...if they decide to do more...even if they decide to pass on the Fedora and leather jacket to a new generation.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
635,MrPink08,"Good action movie, but bad Indy movie",4,21 August 2008,"Eighteen years after we last saw him, Indiana Jones is back, but not necessarily better than ever. Indy returns for a 4th adventure, which has the potential to be great, but in the end makes you just sit there with a stupid puzzled look on your face. Yes, the first three Indy movies had preposterous moments (the car chase on a cliff from Raiders of the Lost Ark comes to mind) but the preposterous moments in this film make you say ""Oh come on, really Spielberg?"" Eighteen years after Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford, awesome as usual) is battling treasure seeking Soviets, as opposed to treasure seeking Nazis. The Soviets are led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchette), who will stop at nothing to get this treasure. Indy is soon called upon by his love interest from Raiders, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), a former colleague gone mad (John Hurt) and a greaser who may or may not be his son (Shia LaBeouf). Once Indy joins up with this group, they're driving, fighting, running, and more in order to return a crystal skull to its original resting spot.As I stated before, this Indy movie really jumps the shark, or, as you will say after viewing this movie, nukes the fridge (don't ask). Sure, the film is rated PG-13, but it felt like Spielberg tried to treat us like we were all 10 years old in this one. For example, in one scene, LaBeouf gets separated from the group. How does he end back with them? He joins some monkeys in swinging from branches. Also, some of the character get annoying after a while. For example, Indy's archaeologist friend Mac (Ray Winstone) flips sides more than a pancake at the IHOP. And Hurt's character is insane, but the filmmakers seem to think this is funny, and they make an ill fated attempt to make him the comic relief.The movie does, however, have some redeeming qualities. Of course, Harrison Ford can make bad movies fun. The action scenes are pretty cool. And finally, the Indiana Jones movie are known for their creepy critters such as snakes and rats. This installment does not disappoint as we are treated to scorpions and man eating red ants.Overall, a fun action flick, but if you are a true Indiana Jones fan, you'll be wishing that Indiana hung up the fedora and whip after The Last Crusade. However...the ending of this film does leave room open for a sequel. Let's hope for the best Indy fans!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
636,jayce2279,Not at all as bad as I was led to expect,8,2 June 2008,"After having read so many negative reviews about this film on the internet, I wasn't sure what to expect, but decided to go see it in the movie theater after all, if only for nostalgia's sake. I have to say, it was much better than I thought it would be and, although I do understand fans' disappointment with some aspects of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, all in all it was still a real Indiana Jones film. Granted, the plot was a little stupid and didn't really fit in, but the over the top part was over in a few seconds anyway. Also, it was fairly obvious what role Shia Lebeouf's character had in this film from the get-go, but the action sequences, car chases, sets, sense of humor and the general atmosphere is exactly the same as in the first three movies. Indy is still a man in over his head who manages to escape from the most implausible situations by a huge amount of luck and he still doesn't take himself too seriously, especially since he too realizes he's getting a little older.One point of criticism that I've read a lot about is that the action sequences are too unrealistic because Harrison Ford is supposed to be too old. I really don't understand this. The stunts are of exactly the same style as the ones in the older films and there was no way a 30 or 40 year old archaeologist could have done those things in real life either, so why do people now suddenly complain that the action is unrealistic because Indy has grown older? Granted, the scene where Shia Lebeouf pulls a Tarzan is a little over the top, but that's just one scene and it doesn't even last long. Another complaint I heard a lot was that there is too much CGI in this film. Again, I wonder where people get this idea. Don't get me wrong, I hate CGI effects. Especially when they are just used to show off what the creators can do, like in the new Star Wars films or I, Robot. But in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, CGI effects were only used when they were really better than traditional special effects and I must say this was done very well and didn't bother me at all, not even the flesh eating ants. How else could they have gotten them on film? Besides, the special effects used for the ending in Raiders of the Lost Ark weren't all that believable either, whereas these new digital effects are. Another critic complained that the movie is too old fashioned, too slow and boring at times. What's wrong with a slower pace? At least Steven Spielberg took the time to actually show the sets in great detail, so you can see that they are built in the same style as the ones in the first three films and that the artists have actually put work into building them. This is something that isn't done anymore in lots of new films that just want to bomb the senses and leave you wondering what exactly it was that you often payed an outrageous price for to go see.Still, Harrison Ford is 65 years old now, so the viewers will have to accept that this fourth Indiana Jones film is set in 1957, 19 years after the Last Crusade. Indy is living in a different world than he was in the 1930s and the entire movie is built around the Cold War theme. There are testing facilities for nuclear weapons, the bad guys are Soviets and KGB agents, the western world is in terror of Communism and Indiana Jones, now a World War II veteran, has done some intelligence work for the CIA. However, the jungles, car chases, hidden treasures, lost temples, creepy crawlers and the whip all have the same feel as in the first 3 films and the newer 50s style vehicles and cities fit right in, especially since the film was shot in a similar way as in our hero's older adventures. However, it would be nice if Spielberg and Lucas could do a couple more sequels set in the Cold War theme, so this film will not go down into history as the ugly duckling of the Indiana Jones Quadrilogy. Still, in all honesty, I feel some of the reviews on the internet are a bit harsh. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is definitely my least favorite Indiana Jones film, but it is certainly still worth the look and a lot better than 90% of the other films that have recently been released, like the monstrosities that are Pirates of the Caribbean II and III that seem to score such high marks on this site.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Cate Blanchett doing a dodgy "" Russian "" accent. Oh and if all that weren't bad enough there are CGI flying monkeys for comic relief. I recommend rewatching the first three.

638,lothd,Above average - just,6,22 May 2008,"Seriously, what can you expect? I expected another hyper-kinetic action movie and got exactly that. The recipe seems to have been ""as much action as possible, hardly a quiet moment, throw in everything AND the kitchen sink"". If the rubber boat sequence in ""Temple of Doom"" made you laugh in disbelief, you'll have more to laugh about here. In the days of ""Die Hard"" and similar excesses this is hardly surprising. ""Raiders"" is one of my favourite films, but ""Crystal Skull"" left me quite cold. On the positive side, Harrison Ford does a good job and the special effects were good enough for me.Go see it, by all means, if you're under 30 it will probably be your kind of movie. I was 29 when ""Raiders"" came out...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
639,ShogaNinja,A Shadow of the Former Series...,1,24 May 2008,"The movie this time around is just downright terrible. There are plot holes you can drive a truck through. For example, they go on about Mayans and aliens. If Mayans were given alien technology WHY DIDN'T THEY INVENT THE WHEEL?! Some peoples die off for a reason, they lacked something crucial to survival. To say aliens came and gave them technology just shows a vast ignorance of archeology, and anthropology. Secondly, there is a scene with some seriously wicked and non-existent ants. This further shows a vast ignorance of the rainforest and it's inhabitants. History is supposed to be made cool with Indy, not spread ignorance.The crystal skull is supposed to be magnetic, yet metal comes all around it and it conveniently was magnetic when it helped the story, and when the idea was cumbersome, they just forwent with it. It's supposed to be made of quartz yet it looks and seems to weigh as much as a plastic resin with some dichroic glitters inside. It seemed to me a cheap prop. Harrison Ford, pushing 70, was body doubled more times than Nicole Kidman in a sex scene. Every single bit of action was obviously shot from afar with a body double. I also noticed that like Danny Glover he's earned himself a nice pair of dentures and subsequently has a similar slur now especially noticeable with the usage of the letter ""S"". Not what I want out of my action star I can tell you that. Why don't these rich actors get dental implants so they can talk normal?In one scene Indy survives a nuclear explosion in a completely impossible and ridiculous way. In another scene his younger counterpart was swinging thru the jungle like Tarzan with chimps like it was a kid's show. Completely and utterly ridiculous garbage in my opinion. This would be OK if this were a PG movie but because of graphic violence this movie is NOT suitable for young children, the only ones who are naive enough to believe this crap. It seemed like all this incredulous stuff happened for no reason at all, not even to advance a story line. It felt worse than watching the latest Star Wars trilogy. The one positive thing I will say is that Industrial Lights and Magic earned their keep, but I have never been one to rely on pretty pictures when there's a story to be told.The last thing I will say about Indy is this. Archaeologists study, document, and preserve history. They do NOT destroy, damage, or otherwise obliterate their digs so they can glean a tiny bit of info to advance a really crappy story line. It just shows more ignorance in archaeology. It's not OK to blow up a lesser dig just to find the artifact you are looking for at the time.There were classic Indy moments, but they felt so contrived with body doubles and fakeness, that this movie ended up a shadow of the former series. Falling over a waterfall three times in a car-boat will kill you I don't care who you are. There is such a thing as inertia and your brain splattering against the inside of your skull from sudden changes in speed (i.e. g-forces). I can look past this for a good story, but it's just more ignorance thrown on like sticks on a fire.The one main theme all around, Ignorance. It's a killer. They should have called in the History Channel for some accuracy. It just felt like they were milking this cash cow one last time before Harrison Ford dies. The only reason I am marking this film at a 5 is because I wasn't having a good time, but I wasn't going to leave or ask for my money back either(thankfully it didn't drag on). Thus, 5 stars. Do yourself a favor and go back and watch the trilogy and just leave it at that. If you must see this, I recommend a rental from your local video store around x-mas.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
640,SonicBoom77,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008),6,27 May 2008,"Indys return is rather weak however Harrison Ford and the crew delivers a entertaining movie.The way to far fetched Indiana Jones seems to go fall down three rivers including one like Niagra Falls, go flying in a fridge after a huge nuclear explosion and walk away from it no problem making you think ""has Indy somehow gotten mutant powers of Wolverine within the last 19 years?"" One of the most annoying thing is that even for Indiana Jones it has turned into a major CGI feast including CGI monkeys, ants,trucks,vines and maybe even that whip and the whip is only used a couple times within the whole film. The plot is entertaining and catches your attention but its odd how the main treasure is just being man hand-held and tossed around like a rag doll. The opening could have been better and more epic however the end was fairly good. Indy's return is action packed and a thrill adventure though the plot is weak and the amounts of CGI and far fetched occurrences cant be ignored is was not worth the wait but it is good enough to check out if your not a die hard Indy fan.

There will never be another Raiders because nobody knew what to expect when walking into the theater. Indy was new and different then. It was a breath of fresh air. Just like getting together with an old friend and trying to relive the good old days, there are just some moments you can never relive. That does not mean you cannot have a good time though. I saw what I expected to see, a whip-cracking archaeologist trying to obtain a supernatural artifact that he will lose in the end, witty dialog and spectacular stunts and locations. After a nineteen year hiatus, it was fun. I will be proud to add this to my DVD collection with my other Indiana Jones movies. The movie delivers what it promises.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

In the new one, harrison ford again essays the role of the archaeologist, treasure hunter perfectly. none does it better. and the theme music in the background tries to recreate magic. though i did not find the indy's love angle thrown in interesting. i think in recent times the movies like national treasure series have done well so comparison with the these and with old henry jones jr. movies is inevitable.if you are a indiana jones fan go see this movie and you would enjoy. If you are a first timer to this character, you may not find the hype created around it worth it. better see the old ones and get a grip on the character and then see this one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

644,brendon-kenny,"There's no doubt that Indy can still handle all the car-chasing, baddie-beating, tomb-raiding action that we've come to expect from the franchise",7,28 May 2008,"It's finally here! The wait is over, and after a 19 year hiatus (!) the legendary whip-cracking archaeologist Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones has returned. With Spielberg and Lucas back at the helm and Harrison Ford donning his old fedora and leather jacket - it's a sure-fire box office hit, but can Indy 4 live up to the hype and meet the heady standards of the classic trilogy? This is already the subject of much debate, many doubting that Ford can convince as an action hero at the grand old age of 65, others concerned that after such a long wait it's inevitable that it'll be a disappointment; the film's detractors expect a backlash similar to Lucas' last return to one of his classic franchises; the release of the Phantom Menace - 16 years after the original Star Wars Trilogy.Let's get this settled from the outset. Ford may be knocking on retirement age, but so is Indy  he's not trying to convince us that he's any younger than he is, and many of the series' trademark wisecracks are at the expense of Indy's age. There's no doubt that he can still handle the car-chasing, baddie-beating, tomb-raiding action that we've come to expect from the franchise, and let's face it, it just wouldn't be Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford. Admittedly, there are a few moments where he's clearly not as sprightly as he once was, and his punches aren't quite the crushing blows they once were, but as these are all part and parcel of the plot it never detracts from the fun. The emphasis being firmly on the Fun, which has always been at the heart of the Indiana Jones films, and this is an incredibly faithful addition to the series  it has all of the hallmarks of an Indy film and cranks the action up to 11.So, expect all of the usual ingredients; from the straight-into-the-action opening scenes through to the overblown supernatural ending, via all of the tricks, traps, tombs and temples, the squirmy insect scenes, the hammy evil villain (Cate Blanchett's Russian caricature Irina Spalko this time round), the globe-trotting treasure map, the epic car chase punch-ups, the obligatory evil natives and a great supporting cast they're all present and correct! So, what's new? What does this new instalment add to the Jones legacy? The first change is the Cold War setting, 19 years after the Last Crusade and the bad guys are now the Russians rather than the Nazis and everything is given a sense of 50's pastiche with the first quarter of the film overloaded with stereotypes and imagery to hammer this home.The plot is even more unhinged and convoluted than expected, and will undoubtedly cause further controversy amongst the fan-base. For the most part it works well  a race against evil Russians to discover the titular Crystal Skull and a legendary City of Gold, with just a cursory nod to the real life history and plenty of fantasy elements thrown in to ensure the proceedings don't get too high brow. However, there are aspects of the plot that may alienate some of the audience, arguably it tries to do too much and is overly explicit with the more fantastical elements of the story. Retaining an air of mystery with some of the sci-fi elements of the movie may have been a smarter move, but that would have inhibited the scope for spectacle  an area that Spielberg and Lucas are hardly renowned for shying away from. There is a scene that very closely resembles the jungle chase of Peter Jackson's King Kong remake, needless to say the special effects here are flawless, but mercifully not as over-used as they were in Kong and the Star Wars prequels. Crystal Skull stays true to the traditional stunt work of the first three films but adds digital gloss to enhance the scale and drama.The cast are a mix of old and new, with the return of Indy's old flame from Raiders, Marion Ravenwood (a rather bewildered Karen Allen), and her son 'Mutt' Williams who's a flick-knife toting 'greaser' that buddies up with Indy after his mother is kidnapped. The character is played competently by Transformer's rising young star Shia LaBeouf, and the banter between Indy and Mutt rates as some of the best in the series, second only to the hilarious rapport he had with Sean Connery in the Last Crusade. Other new additions include George 'Mac' McHale (Ray Winstone), a greedy old buddy of Indy's, a wonderful turn from John Hurt as the screwy Professor 'Ox' Oxley, and a criminally underused Jim Broadbent as the University Dean  the replacement for series stalwart Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) as the actor sadly past away in 1992. As ever, Harrison is the star of the show and most of the other performances are merely bit-parts. Cate Blanchett's suffers the most, as her pseudo-psychic villain seems largely superfluous to the proceedings and her accent is so unconvincing that presumably her part is included purely for comic relief.There are elements of Crystal Skull that miss the mark, unnecessary additions that detract from the overall quality by being just too far-fetched and ludicrous. Without giving anything away, these are painfully obvious when watching  the series has always had its daft, cheesy moments but there are a few occasions here where they jar with the tone of the movie. But somehow, it's forgivable. There's so much fun to be had with all of the in-jokes and references to the previous films, the non-stop action and the familiarity of the formula that it's nigh on impossible not to spend the whole 2 hours with a big beaming grin. For that reason alone it's worth watching, pure entertainment that's great value for a fiver and a Sunday afternoon, and a worthy contribution to the cinematic legend that is Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
645,Robert_90,A decent return to form,8,22 May 2008,"I'll be damned if I wasn't going to review this one. After a lifetime of growing up on the original trilogy, watching them to the point where I have every little sound effect committed to memory, I can now at last revel in the latest installment, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.I think anyone who's been waiting for this movie anywhere near as much as I have should already know the gist of the plot. For those who don't, it's 1957. The Nazis of the original trilogy have been replaced by communist Russians, who are constantly trying to coerce Indy into searching for the eponymous ""crystal skull"". The mystery behind it is unbelievable even by the series's standard (and these are movies where prior artifacts include God melting faces and people living with hearts ripped out), and as such won't get spoiled here because the beauty of it was getting it revealed. Anyway, the adventure takes Indy from the middle of the Nevada desert to the heart of South America in search of the real story behind the weird-looking skulls.I know that it's not particularly original to rely on comparisons to other movies, but all the while I couldn't help but think of Die Hard 4.0. For those of you who aren't familiar with Die Hard 4.0 or more importantly its stylistic departure from its predecessors, it's pretty much an incredible exaggeration of the action that made the original trilogy first. Granted, since the Indy movies were meant to be more over-the-top than the Die Hard movies, this makes Crystal Skull a lot easier to watch, but there a still a number of sequences that are bound to make you go, ""Pfft, like that'd ever happen."" Even so, the action is damned cool in most parts, with one highlight being a rather amusing rip-off of the legendary truck chase from Raiders.Needless to say, I enjoyed it a lot. Even though it was prone to several of the same flaws as any of the others, it was still great. The references to all the earlier films were a nice touch, none of them being as cringeworthy as you'd expect. The acting was a plus, with Ford managing to do yet another great job wearing the hat. Sorry for sounding bad, but everyone was good. Hell, even Shia LeBeouf didn't ruin every frame he was in, he was that good. And the music - right on par with every other Indy score.The only serious fault with Crystal Skull is the relative overuse of CGI. Even though some bits would've been nigh-impossible to do without it, it was still of a quality inferior enough to be distracting, which is a bit of a shame. That's a minor complaint against Skull. It's just a matter of finding out where exactly it sits in comparison to the others. I'll let you know what that is once I've seen it about as many times as the other three (i.e. about fifty times). For now, it was certainly not a waste of time, and it gets my recommendation.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
646,Darth_Guybrush,Better than I expected but not as good as it could have been,8,27 May 2008,"I am, as many of is here at IMDb likely are, a big fan of the Indiana Jones adventures. I would have been about 12-13 years old when I first saw Raiders of the Lost Ark and it remains a favourite to this day. This was also the last movie that my whole family saw together (Mum, Dad and two brothers) and none of us knew what to expect. Needless to say we all loved it.It is hard to believe 27 years have passed since that seminal introduction to one of the highest grossing trilogies in cinema history. Technology has come a LONG way since 1981 and yet the makers of the fourth installment in the series decided - to varying levels of success - to try and mimic the look of the first three films.Story wise Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is almost non-sensical. I'm more likely to believe in the Ark of the Covenant (which apparently is real), Indian cults and the Holy Grail than what is concocted in this release.Yeah I know it is set in 1957 at the height of the Cold War but seriously the story is seriously far-fetched. Like the previous movies there is humour - just not enough of it to be really laugh-out-loud. There is one sequence with Shia LaBeouf that is pretty cool in an acknowledgement to another famous character.Plenty of action sequences - some amazing - some awkward - some a wee bit too long - some non-sensical (Marion - Karen Allen bless her) disappears for a good portion of one action sequence for no real apparent reason).Sean Connery and Denholm Elliot make cameos as photograps (Sean declined a role, enjoying ""retirement"" too much - sadly Denholm passed away in 1992). This is a nice tribute to two great actors that helped build on the success of the series.Soundtrack wise it is brilliant but I do not feel that John Williams soundtrack has the same Oomph! as the previous films - a few themes from the earlier titles are included in snippets however.Acting wise it is a mixed bag. Harrison Ford (Indy obviously) is showing his age but it would have been criminal not to cast him as he IS Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, JR. Shia LaBeouf (Mutt) was better than I expected and really seemed to enjoy the role. Karen Allen (Marion Ravenwood) still looks great and hasn't lost the fire she had in Raiders. Cate Blanchett was merely OK - she does a poor Russian accent and ... well you will see what happens in the end.The special effects when used are impressive - even the CGI - and includes a really awesome explosion (without spoiling it for you). There is probably a bit more blood and violence than seen in earlier iterations so keep the rating in mind if you take your kids along.All in all I really enjoyed the two hour break from reality. A good film that could have been better. Here's hoping for a fifth installment (yes Harrison did really good!). Rating: 8/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
647,wittmann73,The weakest of the Indy films,5,21 May 2008,"Before I start my review let me say I am a huge Indy fan and have been waiting for this movie for 19 years.Bad news first : Number 4 is the weakest of the Indy films. Good news : It is still good entertainment.Let me explain further :The Good :Harrison Ford still IS Indiana Jones. He still has the magic to impersonate this character. You really see his efforts to make this film work. Great camera work and sets. Shia LaBoef is actually quite good and not that annoying, he has some funny lines and scenes. I never regretted that he was in the movie. Some really good action scenes, esp. in the first half of the movie with believable stunts and not too much CGI, e.g. the motorbike chase or the Warehouse battle. Great! Humor was OK and many (not all) jokes worked for me.The Bad :John Hurt as Oxley looked like Dumbledore on Ecstasy. I didn't like his character very much and was glad when he finally became ""sane"" again. Problem was by then the movie was almost over. Sorry guys, Karen Allen. She was overacting too much, smiling and laughing all the way even during the deadliest action sequences. We know she is tough and all but it never felt believable. Also her interaction and reunion with Ford seemed a bit forced. The Villains : Blanchet was OK, but not very menacing or intimidating. You never felt she was a threat. Russians? Give me Nazis as adversaries any day. Ray Winstons character (forgot the name) was confusing and underdeveloped : ""I am on your side, no wait I am a traitor, oh wait I am CIA, never mind I am a traitor again"". WTF? Ant scene : Stolen straight from ""The Mummy"". Shame on you, Spielberg.The Ugly :Sorry, but the last third of the film was the pits. The jungle chase was far ""over the top"" action (Sword fight, ""Tarzan scene""). Indy not using his gun once. At least he didn't carry a walky-talky instead. Nuclear explosion scene. OMG. How embarrassing, who came up with this idea? What was supposed to be funny only got lots of annoyed ""Yeah right"" comments from the audience. Who on earth could survive such an explosion? I couldn't believe it! The plot : Not very suspenseful. Parts of it even boring. Aliens? They waited 19 years for this script? I believe almost anything would have been better. At least the Aliens only appear during the last minutes.All in all a disappointment but still a watchable Indy movie. I think ""less would have been more"" in this case. More believable stunts, less CGI and a better script and the movie would have rocked. I blame Spielberg and Lucas. Kudos to Ford. Should have made Indy IV 10 years earlier.I give it a 5/10 despite all the negative points. First third of the movie 8/10, rest 2/10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
648,sascha-17,"Hats off to Ford, shame on Lucas",4,5 June 2008,"Having read some of the comments on here and having seen the movie in a nearly empty theater just now (OK, OK, Sex and the City was showing on the largest screen in the house), I can't do anything but agree with most criticism already voiced here. The cinematography looked nothing like the old movies. This was especially noticeable during the scenes in Indy's college. In the old films it looked like a dignified, warm and pleasant place - in Skulls it looked dull, boring and uninteresting. The overuse of CGI got on my nerves as well. Why the hell didn't they do what Lucas promised and went for ""real"" action and FX? And what were those scenes with the CG-gophers and the monkeys about? *shrug*My main gripe however is the lack of a decent script. A good Indy-story should have a single ""main object"" for our hero to pursue (Ark, Holy Grail), and some minor artifacts he needs to collect on the way (headpiece of the staff of Ra, knight's shield) in order to find the main MacGuffin. In the fourth film, there's nothing to keep us really interested, no legendary object for our hero to pursue ... or maybe I missed the part where they explained why he needed to find the lost city and what was so interesting about it. And when he finally gets there, it just looks like someone's attic or a garage sale.All this is especially painful to me since secretly I had always hoped they'd adapt one of the greatest Indy-stories for the big screen in the fourth film: The story of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, the 1992 adventure-game by LucasArts. That ancient piece of computer code had a much better story, better characters, better villains, better and more humor and even more believable action scenes than movie number four. It also had a great ending and a much better soundtrack.Final verdict: Go and see it (if you must), but don't expect the same magic as in parts 1 and 3. Don't even expect anything like Temple of Doom (the weakest of the old trilogy). Indy 4 is more like a better version of a modern Indy-ripoff (The Mummy, National Treasure), with the added bonus of an excellent and very fit Harrison Ford. 4/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
649,mcw2112,Indiana Mutt and the Krystal dialog...ugghhh,1,29 November 2008,"Where to begin? Let's see, an entire company of Russian soldiers on American soil...at a top-secret military installation, no-less! In 1957? Not even slightly possible, even in Indy's world. Metallic gunpowder? Since when? (that would kind of make a mess of firearms, no?) Preposterous CGI elements that didn't match up to the real action. (the rocket sled ride WAS however, pure Indiana Jones! Quite believable and fun!!)One. Lead. Lined. Refrigerator. Why was there no virtual rain of refrigerators from the other mock-up homes and why did the blast not crush it like it did 98% of it's surroundings?! What about the heat? Ground control to Lucas/Spielberg! The list goes on: Instantly trainable monkeys, stolen lines from--'The Hunt for Red October', 'The Mummy' and others throughout the film AND if that weren't enough, Spielberg feels the need to borrow from the previous three installments again, and again and again and again...etc....Someone you love is sinking in quicksand, you're in a jungle; Quick, find something to help them out with. Let's see, what is there in any jungle? Branches? No, none of them around. Vines? No, none of them either. How about taking off your jacket and using that? No, no and no. Catch a snake real quick-like and use it for a rope. If I had seen it in the theater, that's where I would have walked out. But there's more!!!A smiling Karen Allen drives off of a cliff in an amphibious car, somehow knowing in advance that a tree would catch them and gently lower them to the river below, only to plummet through THREE giant waterfalls, which at least momentarily takes the stupid grin off of Karen Allen's face. And don't get me started on Cate Blanchet's on-again, off-again accent. Hey, Cate, are you British, Ukrainian or what?Bad, wince-inducing dialog and action scenes that go on for so long that you can help but start to think of other things.A crappy tin-foil-filled plastic, uh,... I mean crystal skull whose powers seem to fluctuate wildly when covered or uncovered by CLOTH or wood. The space between the spaces? String theory in '57? WTF? Gone is the magic and wonderment of the previous films and to have Indy find the 'mcguffin' half-way through the film made the quest to take it back seem a little anti-climatic even with the standard CGI vortex that was bound to happen near the end.(Once again, thanks to the magic of computer graphics, we get to see a beloved character stand ridiculously close to multi- ton chunks of rock and stone flying through the air!) Gone is the witty banter that inevitably arises naturally during the course of telling a good story, and also conspicuously absent was the gorgeous cinematography of the first three films which was clumsily replaced with entirely too many green-screens.George Lucas and Steven Spielberg need to stop pumping out fan-films and take a few years off. These guys raised the bar for big-budget studio films and changed the way movies are made, and now they are part of the same old commercial machine that they helped to change.

650,dantheman0056,Time to hang up the hat Mr. Jones.,5,3 July 2008,"Well after many years since the last Indiana Jones George Lucas and Harrison Ford are back again for the 4th Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the crystal skull. Unfortunately the 4th times is not the charm and Indiana Jones 4th screen adventure bombs. From the opening scene of the CGI gophers to the final wedding scene (yes wedding scene), this movie does not work. It lacks the feelings of excitement and adventure of the past films. The fight scenes are not intense and the enemies are laughable. Unlike the amazing gun battles and fight scenes the action is reduced to sub-par scenes. Lucas has gone on record to say that Indy didn't fire his gun in this movie because it would be inappropriate to 10 years old. Yet this movie was rated PG-13 and past Indiana Jones was full of blood and violence. The supporting actors besides for Shia weren't that good and Indiana and Marion's love subplot was icky to watch. Cate Blanchett was not a very good villain, along with the rest of the Communists. But the biggest problem was the suspension of disbelief.Indiana Jones is an action/adventure movie not a science fiction. The franchise is loved for its archeology and lore of artifacts yet the plot revolves around aliens. There are several scenes that are not believable especially a scene with a nuclear bomb and a fridge.

651,nsterjo,No biggie...,5,22 May 2008,"I will not try to appear as an expert here, cause I am not, but I can express my opinion as one of the many who have seen and loved the Indiana Jones movies and knows a thing or two about what he wanted to see in this fourth installment.I went to see the movie hopeful that it would please me enough to say that it was worth (them) doing this movie and (me) spending the ticket money. Unfortunately, I was let down. Sure, it has the usual action and tricks, some humor here and there and just a stint of the trademark mystery solving that made this movie a classic; but they simply were not enough or of the right dosage. The script was basically dry and without soul, the story kinda shallow, there was no chemistry between the characters, no real humor even though I did laugh at some points, and I could easily see actors instead of characters, trying hard to tell me a story that wasn't really sucking me in.It's a real shame, cause there were great names involved, but I just couldn't help but wishing I was watching the third movie instead. God bless Sean Connery! Maybe, watching it a second or a third time, will make it easier to swallow, but the fact remains, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" follows in the footsteps of last years' big threquels at disappointing and failing to top their prequels.Please don't do a fifth one Spielberg, no matter how strong Ford is in his seventies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Steven Spielberg and George Lucas made a movie like they haven't made for long - long time. I don't understand the people they say there are lots off unbelievable things in the story. This is what made Indiana films always good. In all the old movies there were a lot of things like in the new one. Waterfalls, spiders and insects, enemies and of course mystery too. OK, maybe the close encounters at the end are a little bit unusual but I think they still works well! There is good humor, effects, and everything we want in a movie like this. The actors, especially Ford made everything well! I haven't seen him acting so good in the last 10 year. This is a job for him. All the new characters are made well, Cate Blanchett is brilliant.

653,frezeframe,Indiana Jones 4 (incompetence at the highest of levels),1,27 May 2008,"so maybe they were just trying too hard. Or.. maybe George has been hanging around with the wrong crowd.George, I love you but I am worried about you. A lot of people are smoking crack now days. It's understandable. Just admit you have a problem and just get some help bud.How could a brilliant guy like that write a POS like this? Actually the guy who wrote Indy 4 is named David Koepp. But George oversaw it. He wrote the first three. This is George's baby, not David's. So George is responsible here for hiring David. These are not the instincts of the George we all know... the George that changed the world.The name George Lucas might be untouchable right now, but it can be ruined in the future. Just look at what happened to Michael Jackson.. Lots of legends outstay their welcome. So please George.. don't make anymore mindless, money hogging blockbuster movies that just waste everybody's time and cast a bad shadow on your earlier work (which was some of the finest work achieved) Don't ruin that for everybody. Don't ruin what you worked so hard to build. If you continue making movies like this.. at least hand out packages of ky jelly at the screenings so we can all have something to do. Give us that much.About the movie (this won't take long): (1.) The gophers.. what the fu#k?? What did CG gophers acting like CG characters have to do with any of this? And why so much screen time? they are gophers. This is Indiana Jones. Enough with the stupid gophers! (2.) The lighting was waaay too over the top. I know that you guys wanted to make it nostalgic, but it just looked like a lame daytime TV action series. (3.) OK, you've established Indiana Jones as being a superhero. I will accept that. But everyone else has to play by the rules, unless you establish them to also be superheros. The waterfall scene.. no. I'm not buying it. Everyone falls down this series of giant waterfalls, that would kill anyone, Harrison Ford especially, and everyone survives with no scratches or bruises? Just don't insult us anymore. Come up with something a little less ridiculous. (4.) John Williams- I love you but enough is enough. Tone it down a bit man. The frickin soundtrack was blaring the Indiana Jones theme so long and so loud that it was a distraction. And this movie didn't need any more distractions. (5.) When they first find the magnetic skull in the box- whatever. if it was that magnetic, all the guns would have stuck to it, they wouldn't have been able to get it out the door. The magnet seemed to have it's own agenda as to what was going to stick to it. Stupid scene. Careless scene. (6.) The spaceship taking off... Granted, I stopped paying attention about 45 min prior to this scene, but..really? Spaceship? It's Indiana Jones! There shouldn't be any spaceships and aliens in Indiana Jones! Why can't you stick to the genre you created Geroge? WTF? Why do you feel a need to show off? Why can't you tell a good story like you used to? (7.) The wedding scene at the end... As mind numbingly brilliant as it was, as crucial to the plot as it was.. I still threw up in my mouth a little bit. So, thanks for that. (8.) The characters sucked. They flat out sucked. Yes, even Shia's character ""Indiana Jones the third"" sucked. The acting was good, but the dialogue was dangerously bad. I'm surprised there haven't been any riots or violent protests at screenings of this movie. (9.) The snake as a rope thing.. no. Please think of something else to include Indy's fear of snakes. That was a train wreck of a scene. And the CG scorpions were unnecessary and lame. (10.) All the green screen work was terrible. For an independent film, it would have been cool, but for the godfathers of modern cinema.. it was pi#ss poor. (11.) And we've come to this- My final gripe. I saved this one for last: What the fu#k was with the nuclear blast????? Indy survives a nuclear blast huh? Nobody thought that was a bit much? George just let this David Koepp as@hole write that into the script? Nobody said anything? A nuclear blast? It's Indiana Jones man, and it's a nuclear blast! He's an archaeologist and a brawler. He's not Iron Man or Superman.. he's Indiana Jones. Stick to your own rules George! Don't allow some idiot to write in a scene like that and loose your audience. If anybody knows not to do things like this it should be you. That's why I'm concerned with you're health and safety. You have lost your mind sir. Get well soon.George produced this thing, and he oversaw the writing, and green-lighted any script. (including the horrible one they went with) but I hold Steven Spielberg just as accountable. The directing wasn't bad but there was no substance to work with. That should have been a red flag to back out of this project or bring in another writer. With this script, this one was going to suck anyways.. so it was his job to save the movie. I give him props for trying, but it was a poor decision on his part. He was at a tremendous disadvantage... kinda like when Barry Sanders played for the Lions. And hey let's face it- if Steven Spielberg can't save your movie, that is not good my friend.. just like a team that can't win with Barry Sanders. If you read all of this rant and you've seen the movie.. I'm sure you can relate. If you haven't seen the movie.. consider yourself warned. At least go with a friend so you can make fun of it. Otherwise you'll always wish for those two hours of your life back.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

There's one scene where Indy's genitals are being washed by a decontamination worker. There's another scene where Indy's male friend is standing with a drink, with his collar totally unbuttoned, while he is watching Indy's ass as he walks across the room. It's also very critical of communist protesters, showing scenes with Indy inadvertently riding a motorcycle through their protest, while Indy still proclaims to be a strong supporter of freedom.

That was the Spielberg touch! Then came that 2nd movie - merely a vehicle for Spielberg's ""mistress,"" the talentless Capshaw. I didn't even bother going to the theatre. I knew better. I saw it on VHS, and it was bad.The 3rd movie had the Great Sean. Enough said?I even enjoyed the television series when it was on.Then came this garbage, and that is an understatement! I don't know what else I can add, other than I don't understand why anyone bothers spending money on the name of Spielberg or Lucas. One might as well watch Lucas' other modern marvels over and over and over.....My children thought this movie was ridiculous, and they are all preteens! Spielberg must have found some of his CE3K aliens lying around his garage and came up with this stupidity. Why, Harrison, embarrass yourself? It's bad enough Blanchett (especially with that wig and unreal accent that makes her a dead ringer for Natasha Fatale) has, but, Harrison, you know better! Even more, I am disappointed with one of my favorite actors, John Hurt. Not only is he wasted here, he acts wasted. Where did he get the motivation? His character acts and looks like the reverse of Jar-Jar here! And poor Allen. Her hair has to cover the sides of her face so that the make-up artist can do less work at hiding her age! Oh, how I was waiting for Boris Badenov to help ""Natasha"" and Rocky & Bullwinkle to help save the day!

657,james-forrest,"Making an Indy Movie after all this time- ""Not as easy as it used to be""",4,23 May 2008,"Indy 4 was barely an average movie. It was trying too hard to be Indiana Jones. Here is my rant bullet point style: Most of those cute little references didn't work for me.Indy looking at that mole or whatever which are so blatantly CGI and unnecessary! (especially seeing as it opened with one- what the hell were they thinking!) This is Indy Jones after 19 years, and what do we get....some crappy animation right at the start! Don't they understand this is Indy after such a long time and people were anticipating this like hell- they should have had a better opening than that.I want scenic shots, I want the Indy music I want something that anticipates nicely from the get go that Indy is back...not wondering if I have stumbled into some advance screening of Kung Fu Panda or something.It is just as bad as putting Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars The bantering didn't seem natural.The part where Cate Blanchett put the Crystal Skull back on the aliens head or whatever where she just falls done and looks like she is having some sort of fit looked totally retarded.John Hurt who is a seasoned actor had a stupid role which was just annoying.The comedy of the snake being thrown at Indy was amusing, however the argument between Marion and Jones before this was pretty crap.The wedding ending seemed like a bit of a joke. Like it was some sort of weird parody. OK the hat blowing to Shia only for Indy to pick it up to create that ambiguity of 'What's next' was OK.George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson pull your heads in and stop ruining important material for the fans.Im not saying i expected this to be Raiders, however this should have been a 4/5 movie at least.....unfortunately it was quite average.Steven Spielberg said this one was for the fans. And he was right- the fans are the only ones trying as hard as they can to find the bits and pieces in this mess to make it pass as an average movie because they don't want to accept that Indy comes back after 19 years with this crappy effort.Indiana 4 never had that ""Kick ass Indy is back"" moment I was waiting for.Good points -Some good lines ""Er...big ants...run!"" Lines like this worked. Lines like ""I have a bad feeling about this"" ""Damn I thought that was closer"" and ""Not as easy as it used to be"" did not hit. There has to be a way to do this backwards referencing without the lines being as forced or brimming with cheddar cheese.-Liked the references with Sean Connery's picture ( I liked the extra shot of Indy pausing to look at the photo and the shot of his picture transitioning to the train station scene) and the other old friend, i forget his name, the one the statue's head fell off of. (Marco?) -Good suspension of disbelief that Indy is younger like in the old school days when you just see his back/outline of his hat in shadows etc.-Even though the CGI was overused, I did like the part at the end with Indy standing back to us facing this huge UFO. Crazy but cool.Overall though, could I stand up and cheer in the cinema proclaiming ""Hell yeah Indy is BACK!"" Absolutely not.Thanks George for bringing back Indy mostly ruined. What is next on your table of destruction? Oh yes, that Star Wars animation. Nice times.-James.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
658,mrw8,Full of self-conscious gimmicks and too mouthy,6,27 May 2008,"I expected this film would be a mistake because Lucas was involved. He may not be completely sane anymore, perhaps pining for the jungles of Dagoba and the wisdom of Yoda. It's hard to imagine that ""The Mummy"" would become the new Indiana Jones franchise, but that's what has happened. In fact, Indiana Jones #4 attempts to steal quite a bit from The Mummy, but does it much worse because of the heavy expectations and sacred-cowness of these characters. When you have characters that the producers love more than themselves then you run into trouble. WHERE IS THE JEOPARDY? Yes, there are plenty of crisis situations but the sacrifice and emotion is mostly absent. Far too many self-referential comments and far too few new ideas. This was ""The Mummy Returns"" all over. But The Mummy at least avoids the gimmicks and mouthy dialog. IT was sort of painful to watch the otherwise humble and natural Karen Allen take a paycheck to play a small role in an ensemble mess. And Harrison Ford learned some bad habits in Hollywood Homicide and Six Days and Seven Nights and Spielberg let him get away with a little too much nonchalant banter. I kept thinking that times have surely changed for scenes to go on for five minutes after their usefulness has ended. Remember the scene with the monkey and the dates in Indy #1? There was suspense and forward motion and sacrifice and drama AND plot development. All in one short little scene with a monkey and a date. That was the kind of style and honesty that Indy #3 and #4 wholeheartedly abandoned in favor of cheap jokes and visual gimmicks. Where, I wondered, was the loyal dog who runs up to save the day by handing Indy his whip or hat or biting the fuse of the dynamite? Indy #4 is that kind of movie.Someone told me that the ending was disappointing, but I felt that if you were still on the hook by the ending then you should have no problem with it. Yes, I was 15 when Indy #1 came out, but my father also loved that film. I still watch Indy #1 regularly and think it does everything right. Indy #4 doesn't know if it wants to make love to these characters or make a movie with them. I can't believe a 15 year old kid will respond to this mouthy film with anything but a yawn.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
659,pforrest-2,Harrison Ford on top form,8,30 May 2008,"I didn't expect a lot of this movie, and was pleasantly surprised. A mostly decent script, believable stunts, fun chases, and altogether an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. Harrison Ford is stunningly good, still at the top of his powers - an incredible performance for someone of his advanced years (sorry Harry!). OK, it's a bit racist, a bit politically incorrect, a lot clichéd, and totally predictable... but that's what action movies are all about. Cate Blanchett is very good value, John Hurt works hard, and the Russian baddies aren't too sloppy either. Jim Broadbent handles a simple role well, Ray Winstone is a bit of a disappointment, and Shia laBeouf seemed pretty average to me. And if he put 15 lb of muscle on for this role, um, oh well.... Trivia: I couldn't understand why in the café the girl at the table behind the protagonists was continually in shot; I guess the answer is that she is perhaps Sasha Spielberg, and could have a glittering career in front of her. She certainly caught the director's eye... This film is worth going to just to witness an iconic performance by Harrison Ford: natural, witty, beautifully timed, handsome, and even athletic.

The Tarzan vine scene, the fridge blast scene, cmon. How come Indy never discusses who the kids' mother is after the diner scene until we see her. Like they've had no time to discuss this since embarking on a round the globe journey. And Shia's outfit was like Marlon Brando on the motorcycle. Boring characters that no-one cares about with too much CGI. I shelled out $13 bucks to see this opening night on the IMAX and wasn't expecting much after the initial reviews, but got even less.

661,mrmatt14,Are you kidding me?,1,24 May 2008,"Three things in life are certain -- Death, Taxes, and that this new Indiana Jones movie will gross at least a billion dollars at the box office. Given that they could have spent any amount of money and still turned a profit, and that they've had 20 YEARS (!!!) to do it, the fact that this is what Spielberg and Lucas decided was worthy of our attention is insulting.Spielberg once had a gift. He made movies that captured the imagination and defined a genre. He's lost that that touch, as he hasn't made a decent movie since Empire of the Sun (yes, I'm including Indy 3 in the dark period, not up to the standard of Raiders, and as much of a last hurrah as he's had.) These days, Spielberg just makes bad movies -- Schlocky, sappy, animated, amusement park ride, popcorn munching crap. It's what he does, but he's become successful at it. He apparently made the decision a long time ago to trade his legacy for a pile of cash, and I suppose that's to be respected in a very Hollywood way.If Spielberg wants to brag to the world that he's lost his touch and can't do what he did 20 years ago, that's his business, but he shouldn't have done it with my childhood heroes.That's heaping a lot of (well deserved) blame on the director, but he's not alone. The script was awful, especially when it came time to stop everything that's going on and present exposition. It couldn't have been more ham-handed if they flashed a big red EXPOSITION sign on the screen. The acting was mediocre at it's best. The score was grating and WAY too loud, and the whole thing looked like it was shot in a Sam's Club warehouse (I know, I know, they were going for an old serial look and feel. They failed. Miserably)This would have been a GREAT addition to the Tomb Raider franchise. As an Indy, it's best to just watch the trailer.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

My main issue with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull it's also it's best thing Indiana Jones himself due to its great seeing Harrison back in his most famous role alongside Han Solo but also I'm questing why does Indiana do not feel pain in this one compare to when he was younger?

663,onelegobuilder,Despite some flaws Indiana Jones 4 is a triumph,8,25 May 2008,"*Beware Spoilers Ahead* It's incredible that several Hollywood veterans are able to reprise roles they played twenty years ago. First there was Bruce Willis who returned as John McLane. Next, there was Sylvester Stallone who returned a fourth time as John Rambo. But they pale in comparison to Harrison Ford who triumphantly returns as Indiana Jones a fourth time. Ford is still fighting old age, with great acting, a sharp wit, and a strong physical performance. First I shall say the ""GOOD NEWS."" Ford still has the charm and heroism from all those past Indy films. Ford also has a lot of help from a superb supporting cast as well. There's Karen Allen returning as Marion Ravenwood from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". She is pretty funny and full of charm in this one. Shia Labeouf delights as Mutt, a greaser with an attitude. Plus there's veteran John Hurt as professor Oxley, who also delivers some laughs and knowledge for the film. He goes insane looking for the skull and tells Indiana how to find the temple through speaking riddles. Cate Blanchett as Russian Agent Irina Spalko makes a cool villain, if kind of hollow- looking. She reminds me a lot of SPECTRE agent Rosa Klebb in the 007 film ""From Russia With Love."" Finally the action sequences are very well staged from the opening at the warehouse, to the car chase in the rain forest. A lot of it is really quite a fun ride Now the ""BAD NEWS."" At the height of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas's careers you would think they would pull off yet another movie classic. These are two of Hollywood's greatest visionaries who created Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, E.T., and Star Wars. Now in an unprecedented 3rd sequel they made a 4th Indy film that might not meet the fans expectations. For instance, Spielberg said the CGI would only be used at a minimum, only where it really counts. Well in the opening there are CGI Prairie dogs that are kind of silly. So are some outlandish car stunts. In a John Williams interview, he said the film is like a ""live-action cartoon"" which probably means it was made for young audiences. The story may also be a little far-fetched. Anyone who knows the history of the crystal skulls, there are 8 out of 13 crystal skulls unearthed by Archaeologists. They are the perfect size and shape of a human skull believed to be created by the Mayans. But because the craftsmanship seems too perfect to be done by hand, others believe that the 13 skulls were done by artisans from Atlantis. Others also believed the creators were aliens from another planet. Going in the direction of aliens for the story is somewhat unbelievable. It also gets confusing once the climax comes into play. What bothered me the most is that the film's PG-13 rating is an exaggeration. Other that occasional obscenities, the film's violence is pretty mild. It only gets ugly when Indy beats up the bad guys. But when bad guys kill good guys (usually with guns) they kill them off screen, Seeing that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" worked well as PG-13 with gun violence and little or no blood and gore; Spielberg could've taken the violence to the next level. It is possible that Lucas and Spielberg only wanted to entertain audiences both young and old rather than live up to the life-long fans expectations. I am a big fan of Indiana Jones but I love the action/adventure genre as a whole. Like ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park,"" it was far from perfect but I enjoyed watching it from start to finish, as I also did with Indy 4. If your a fan don't expect ""Crystal Skull"" to equal ""Raiders of the lost Ark"" because it won't. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. While your at it, try spotting nods to earlier Spielberg/Lucas films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
664,mattwaterhouse,Outlandish,8,28 May 2008,"In terms of the Indiana Jones movies, this film falls seriously short. Crystal Skull cannot compete with the others, but it is still a pretty good action flick with brilliant action sequences, a solid script and some neat references to the film series, such as a cameo for the Ark of the Covenant at the beginning.The main problem with this movie, indeed with the series, is that there is a standard formula: Indy has to find a relic, an evil guy also wants to find the relic, the evil guy makes Indy get the relic, the relic kills the evil guy, relic is lost, the end. Despite this, the trilogy worked brilliantly, it was incredibly inventive and it always brought the best out of the cast. For Crystal Skull, this formula is used again (if it isn't broken, don't fix it) but it doesn't work, and the problem isn't that it's a bad movie, because as I've said it isn't. The problem lies with the films premise.The Crystal Skull of the title is not a plausible relic. At least with the other films the artifact is believable, because they were religious icons from an age that is a mystery to us. They were grounded on the planet Earth, and to be honest, involving aliens in a Indiana Jones film is seriously flawed logic. Indy is not sci-fi. Indy has never been sci-fi. Granted the skull was sort of a religious icon, but ALIENS? It didn't work, and the ending was such a disappointment I was left wondering what the point of the film was. The treasure was knowledge. OK, i get that. The knowledge set the villain on fire? Wha...? Marion and Indiana get married? Come on, the series is better than that kind of cliché.When it was good, Crystal Skull was infallible. But the end was such a poor cliché I felt cheated.======And then, several weeks after i posted this comment, I realised that I was wrong and that cliché was the point.The Indy films are intended to be B-movies, and Crystal Skull epitomises this brilliantly, far more than the others do. Whether that's a good or bad point really depends on the viewer, I personally didn't like it at first but then later I realised the merit and purpose of the style. Without the B-movie tone the film would definitely not be as rewarding an experience.To like this film you have to get it, and now that I do i can see that it is much better than I realised at first. I still think the older ones are better, but in my revised view Crystal Skull stands up nicely. I look foreward to more :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
665,GrowMagicBeans,Spielberg... Lucas.... Why Aliens? (!!!CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!),3,11 August 2008,"Warning, I have not tried to conceal any of the plot elements in this review. I just wanted to vent my anger: I so wanted this to be a good movie. I wanted to be rekindled with that glowing feeling form my childhood and surely if anyone could do it, Indi could! ...you would think. There were perhaps moments. The chase leading up to and through the university on a motor cycle had echoes of the epic chase sequences from Raiders of the Lost Arc which made that movie an instant classic. But these moments were few and far between, hampered by a weak and outrageous plot.What were the Beard Brothers thinking when Lucas and Spielberg reunited for this one??? I know the third movie in the series -The Last Crusade- upped the anti in developing Indi as character when it introduced Sean Connery as his father, but trying to trump that by developing Indi into some kind of war hero just felt insulting. Everyone knows that Indi doesn't do wars, he just irrevocably ends up getting mixed up in them. Arrgh, the anger! He hates military and government - the bureaucrats locked up his Ark for crying out loud!I know he's getting on a little in years, but does he really have to hook up with the chick from the first one?? Come one, let's see that the man has still got it. We want new blood! But not in the form of a son. Shock horror, who didn't see that coming? 'Mutt'! ...ugh, unfortunately that little play on words was probably the height of the humour.But really, what is it with Spielberg and his obsession with extraterrestrials? First Encounters, ET, AI, Minority Report, War of the Worlds... all great movies in their own right, but in all honesty, aliens belong as much to Indiana Jones as they would in Saving Private Ryan!!! Until Spielberg proves me wrong by cutting an acceptable alternate ending where a space ship lands on the bridge to protect a dying Captain Miller from the advancing Germans, my indignation will remain. The rage I felt as the last twenty minutes of this movie unfolded before my incredulous eyes – my temper was comparable to that of a spoiled child throwing a tantrum... not quite the placid echos of my childhood that I had hoped for.

666,streetrodfan,"Absent minded but most great adventures tend to be from time to time, has its charming moments",10,1 December 2010,"The movie has several moments that personally remind me of the other 3 movies. There's a few chase scenes near the beginning of the film that are done old Hollywood style. Real stunts, real vehicles. There's a few lines throughout that are very Indiana Jones, the father and son relationship from Last Crusade is further explored as Indiana Jones gets older, he discovers his son.The humor is the same goof ball action humor from the first 3 movies. ""JONESSSS!"" Fun action/ adventure scenes. Though this time they attempted to make this a take of 50s adventure/ action movies, I don't think it worked out as well as they hoped. I think it was well done, but I'd say a lot of people weren't expecting it.There's silly scenes like we've seen in TOD and Last Crusade. Throughout, the movie has its charming moments.The movie is different than the others. It's been several years, and the character is older, and I think they were having fun with the obscurity of it all.Every Indiana Jones movie, to be honest, had it's light heart-ed, goof ball moments in my opinion. Such as a fighter jet screaming through a tunnel with no wings. Or the raft scene from TOD. I think every Jones movie has those moments.I enjoyed this movie, it might try to make you laugh a little more than the others, and it might be a little absent minded, but most great adventures tend to be a little absent minded from time to time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
667,MEEdmo42,I must be in the minority.....I loved it!,10,1 September 2008,"Have not read all the comments (there are certainly a lot!), but just the first bunch makes me feel like I saw a different movie from the rest of the viewers. I went with the expectation that Indy is now much older and things wouldn't be quite as quickly paced. I found that both Indy and Marion look great for their ages. The bits of gray hair and wrinkles make them seem more real and I was in great admiration for their acting skills which I enjoyed as I did with the other three. There were so many little moments of fun and enjoyment, as well as lots of action and that splendid music, that I liked it enough to see it more than once. I guess I was not expecting perfection, or doubting that the characters, after all these years, would be older and a little slower. Granted, the adventures of the other three were perhaps a bit more exciting.......but I loved the premise of Indy having a son he didn't know about, of him still being in love with Marion even after all these years, and having the answers for getting out of the tight spots which was learned through years of adventures, while his new-found son learned from him. I liked all the characters pretty much, except for the role Cate Blanchett played. She was interesting, but not very threatening. Since it was the 50's, it had to be Russian, not German, so that was appropriate. I, for one will be looking forward to getting a copy of it to watch again as I have the others. I was not disappointed.Mary Goshen,IN",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
668,whitakeroh,Atrocious,2,26 May 2008,"I am 27 years old and have been a fan of Indiana Jones since I was a child. I loved Indiana Jones because I loved the adventure seeking coupled with the realistic daring of Indiana Jones himself.This film, Indy Jones 4, contains none of the qualities which so thoroughly impressed me in my youth. I grant that it is possible my expectations may have been somewhat distorted due to me being older and more critical but I will not submit that I am so jaded that my critique of Indy Jones 4 is unfounded and is due to those youthful memories free from critique. There are core elements of Indy Jones which are plain out missing here. I will point out some of the faults in detail to follow: (1) This movie lacks artistic realism: Look, audiences of Indy Jones have always suspended belief. I mean, in Raiders there are ghosts/spirits that fly around when the ark is opened. In Temple of Doom there is an inflatable boat that goes down a mountain and in Crusade you have Indy and dad shooting down Nazis in a bi-plane after leaving the blimp. However, in this film the critique I am levying deals more with the film's quality itself. For example, everything is out of place and makes no sense. In the other films the pieces fit together, here everything is disconnected. Why the references to Communism all throughout the movie and talk of being put on a list? I know history and I understand the ""blacklist"" and McCarthyism blah, blah, blah; but Is this a GW Bush attack? It is not needed, we get it people..it is 1950. Shia's character as youthful protagonist is ridiculous. He is like 16 and is flying across the world with Indy and is brining his motorcycle? This is completely out of place and has nothing to do with suspending belief. A 16-17 year old boy brings his motorcycle across the world...why? And why would anyone let him do that or pay for that? That is simply lack of artistic integrity and has nothing to do with completing an adventure that the characters are put into.(2) Horrible Acting: The only saving grace here is that Indy Jones played by H. Ford still has the ability to show that same sarcastic anger that he always has, unfortunately he shows it during forgettable scenes with Marion what's her face and her annoying MTV movie star son ""Shia"". Why was she put in this horrid film? Her acting was horrible, she would get angry at things that no one would get angry at, she was calm during certain events where no one would be calm in. Shia's character, uh Mutt, (whatever dude) was over the top and retarded. The scene where he tries to fight ""joe College"" is retarded. We hear, ""hey greasers, hey jocks"". What is this? Spielberg and Lucas are bloated pompous multi-millionaire filmmakers whom I am sure were told this film is awful yet still forged this atrocious piece of money making garbage out of bad acting, bad plot and bad common sense. Finally, Cate Blanchett, the new darling of a pathetic Hollywood, is acting as eye candy. That's great she can speak with a Slavic accent but why is she the villain here? Would Stalin use a woman for anything that requires going to the US with Russian troops and killing US military personnel on a US Military top secret base during the 1950s? Are you serious? This choice of villain, again, has nothing to do with suspending belief for an event that must happen; this choice of villain is simply a bad choice on part of the filmmakers who have a liberal agenda and it reflects the poor overall quality of the film in general. Use a man-that would eliminated this unnecessary task of asking the audience to re-imagine and reinvent history.(3)The ""Feel"": This critique is hard to describe. Indy Jones always seemed ""down and dirty"". His whip, his hat, his hard nosed intense approach to everything. Here we have a film that is way too glossy for Indy Jones. Remember the scene in the last crusade where Indy is hanging by a thread, literally, on a tank cannon and is rubbing on a cliff while debris falls down his jacket into his shirt and his eyes are wide? That ""feel"" of an Indy movie is COMPLETELY ABSENT here. Instead we have ""Mutt"" in a perfectly fine leather coat and perfect hair swinging from trees with monkeys onto a jeep. All the Indy Jones movies have a gritty realism to them, though certain events or plots may be far beyond belief. Not this one, not at all. Part of the prob is CGI, part of it is the taste and market for movies these days. Kids are seeing this movie mainly with their parents. And kids like stylized retarded stupid MTV gloss with no substance. Remember temple of doom and the bugs? Remember how real it was to see bugs crawling all over them and seeing Indy's hat being crushed by a descending cavern ceiling? None of that here. We have CGI ants. Let me pose a question to Hollywood and the money grubbers that run it: why is there still this erroneous belief that CGI can mimic realism? It cannot. Especially in cases where are senses would be heightened during certain events. Seeing bugs crawl on people in the Temple of Doom was MUCH realer than seeing retarded CGI ants get squashed between Ms. Blanchett's legs. We have aliens, much has been made about this in other posts and suffice to say that even if I would allow that Aliens are appropriate for a plot the way they are used here is beyond absurd. There is nothing else to say really about the aliens.This movie is far worse then expected. It is truly a let down.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Setup,Creepshow, carchase, carchase (or is it creepshow again) then carchase or creepshow (repeat as much as you like in varying order until resolution) 'The End'(or is it). Sprinkle generously with fights too. Actually not to put it down. IT WORKS. Good old time escapism, that's what movies are all about. Actually the old time movie serials like Radar Men From The Moon or Flash Gordon probably invented this style. Spielberg has arguably carried it to perfection. The old time serial guys didn't have either the budget or the special effects technology to properly execute their dreams. This particular series mines nostalgia very well. In the current example, 50's & Cold War nostalgia. Don't get me wrong. I really like the Indiana Jones Movies, all of them. A lot of class in this one by bringing back Harrison Ford & Karen Allen. Would have been very tempting to just dump them a La the James Bond films. All of this series are hyperkenetic too. Not one instant is wasted on setting mood just for itself. No clumsy fiddling around with establishing look backs or plot points. Any stuff like that is neatly placed at just the right spot during a creepshow or carchase. The whole style reminds me of a roller coaster ride. No deeper MESSAGE that I could see in this one or any of the others either. If you must do a MESSAGE ""lay it between the lines"" (Peter, Paul & Mary). Shows more class that way. This is very useful. If you don't take a stand on any current or real controversy in a film you don't stir up potential customers. It's easier for the unsophisticated to understand good guys vs bad guys anyway. If anybody is offended by a hidden message you always have plausible denial. Great movie, great escapism. What happens next to Indy? Does he get killed in the next one or just become more grey & professorial? Maybe even time to just let it go.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
670,orsino44,Indy Sci-Fi,6,28 May 2008,"At last we get another Indiana Jones film! But can we enjoy it?First of all, you have to get on board with the notion that the film makers have brought the character into the realm of 50s B movie sci-fi films, like Them, The Thing, and The Day the Earth Stood Still. There's still a lot of serial action, but with a heavy dose of sci-fi this time.There are far more shots to make you roll your eyes in disbelief than in previous installments (like the Tarzan thing, the tree ride and the triple waterfall), but those flaws don't kill the movie - just the last 30 minutes of the movie. The new characters are very good, and Ford proves he's still got it and could do another one of these movies, too.It's the least of the series thus far, but that only means the series has produced a 10, two 8's, and a 6. And that ain't chopped liver.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
671,FabD1,Anything goes,5,21 May 2008,"In olden days...Indiana Jones was a great and fun hero. His adventures were full of unexpected twists, they were very well edited and the composer (John Williams) was writing great music because he himself had enjoyed immensely the latest movie. If today...all this were still true, I would have loved this fourth installment. But the fun is gone. I feel the basic fault (readers of Balint beware!) lies with the script. You feel and see how the poor screenwriters have been told that their jobs was to write what Lucas and Spielberg probably assume to be the archetypal Indiana Jone movie, namely...essentially a rehash of the third movie, with a zest of the first two and some very common ado taken from a thousand other movies. And, guess what? It simply does not work; the story ark (no pun intended) is not well conceived, the humor falls flat most of the time, and the characters very often sound or act cliché. The reason: the aim was not to make a good, new and interesting movie but to give the audience what the audience is presumed to love. You know, folks, that's recipe for disaster, and you should all know that. Aren't you professionals?What else is wrong? Oh, well, the editing ranges from OK to extremely poor, and John Williams was apparently so bored by the movie (who would not be, by the way) that he felt his duty, as a good composer, was to let that boredom be felt in his music. Let me add that at least the acting was good (Harrison Ford is GREAT) and that Spielberg's directing is technically faultless. In all fairness, I could not judge the cinematography, because I went to see the movie in a big, very famous theater in Paris and, Paris being Paris, the quality of the projection was horrendous. I may update this review if I ever see the movie on BD. I won't comment on the costumes and the sets, they are what you expect; again, nothing new there.Anyway, I felt cheated at the of the movie. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against franchises, but even the worst Star Trek or James Bond movie is more original and more daring than Indy 4. The comparison with Stallone's recent work is extremely revealing. Stallone succeeded, after a 20 year hiatus, in adding something interesting and new to the Rocky and Rambo characters. Luca/Spielberg do not succeed in adding anything to Indy.I can only hope that, somehow, a fifth movie is going to be made and that Spielberg and Lucas will get the next one right. And, Harrison, if you read these lines: Keep up the good work, you are the best redeeming virtue of the movie!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
672,malikroberts16,Two thumbs way up!!!,8,27 May 2008,"If there's one thing I gotta say about No. 4 of Indy's adventures, it's ""off-da-hook!"" Harrison Ford was great as Dr. Jones, and I hadn't seen him just like that before, but it was as good as ""Raiders"", ten times better than ""Last Crusade"". ""Temple of Doom"" is still my absolute favorite.I noticed how they put the Lucasfilm logo first, and THEN the Paramount logo, and that's a helluva way to start a Spielberg/Lucas movie, and I never saw somethin' like that before in my life. I also saw how they took out the new, regular Paramount logo and replaced it with the hand-painted one that I saw on the first three films. You can't help but laugh at the fact that it looked just like their logo from the early '70s, AND they took the Gulf+Western tag at the bottom and just put ""A Viacom Company"" instead.When I saw the opening credits flash on the screen to Elvis' ""Hound Dog"", (I'm gonna just go ahead and use this phrase anyway) ""shivers went up and down my spine"". They really did.Karen Allen is back FINALLY as Marion Ravenwood, and that kid Shia was all right as Mutt. Cate Blanchett is a SCENE-STEALER as Col. Dr. Spalko. One minute she's Kate Hepburn, the next she's Bob Dylan, and the one after that she's Queen Elizabeth. That's one of the things I really like about her, how she's able to switch roles from movie to movie like that. That's real inspiring.For any and all Indy fans around the world, this is a MUST-SEE!!! I was lucky enough to see it on its opening weekend, on Memorial Day. SEE THIS MOVIE, before it leaves the houses on ya, or you can wait until it comes to DVD (that's one thing I'm definitely buyin'), and lemme tell ya, it's gonna sell like HOT CAKES!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

After the mess of the Star Wars Prequels and War of the Worlds, I had very little expectations; anything slightly surprising would have made my day.But wow, Indiana Jones 4 managed to disappoint me even more than I thought possible. The story is childish, the dialogues are just there as bridge to the action sequences (not adventure, but action) and might as well have been written by a 12 years old. Unless your IQ falls below the 85 mark, make sure to smoke a big one before going to see this movie.Please note, it's just another action movie, not an adventure movie like it used to be. No more puzzles or need to explain things, just a pile of lame clichés and action sequences with a totally predictable plot.SPOILER, This movie could be resumed as follow:Russians: Aliens: Nuclear Blast: Car Chase 1: Girl from First movie: Car Chase 2: Tarzan: Giant Ants: Pyramids: Space Ship: WettingWTF Lucas?If they keep making crap like this they will manage to get the youth to read books again.

674,kewos,Goodbye Indi!! Leave this stuff to X-Files people.,5,14 January 2009,"I will always be an Indiana Jones fan. I grew up with him so after those years I couldn't believe that finally the 4th one was on theatres. I went to the cinema with so high expectations and they last it for half of the movie. I always measure movies depending if at the end I'm happy to have paid the ticket or it would have been better wait and rent it. This one was on the edge.I don't mind see H. Ford getting older and un-fit, don't mind the first incredible action scene with the fridge but I mind Indi having a son or how his first love is again introduced in his life and of course not forgetting the Happy ending (still thinking is not possible). And what about all these E.T thing. Spilberg lost the plot here. For me Indi was always about chasing ancient objects, magic, don't know but I know this movie has to do more with X-Files than to archeology. First part of the movie is actually good, keeping Indi style but little by little it gets worst and worst. Doesn't click at all leaving you at the end with a sweet and sour taste of what could it have done if the theme had been different, if they weren't that amount of romantic-sensible twists or without the X-files stuff and in the other hand you are happy cause you could have seen Indi again. Afterall 6.5/10 and praying for Spilberg not making a fifth one ever cause it could kill my myth forever.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
675,agsconnolly,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Numbskulls,4,12 June 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a terrific film. The best of the initial trilogy, it had a great story, heart-pounding action and wonderful interplay between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. So naturally, any film attempting to follow it would need to have the same ingredients. And hey, when a cast list was dangled in front of my eyes including Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone, the terrific Shia Le Beouf and the old Doctor himself I felt that the mix was there for an equally impressive new adventure.Sadly, I was wrong. From the moment I heard the title, alarm bells began ringing. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the, erm, thing. It was immediately forgettable stuff, and confusing to boot, which was an ominous precursor to the film itself. Sitting in the cinema, it quickly became apparent that the film's greatest flaw is its story, or lack of. Which is a great shame as the plots of the previous three films, although far-fetched, were easy to follow, well-constructed and thus exciting to watch. The plot in this movie can be easily explained with a quote from Edmund Blackadder: ""Well it started badly, it tailed off a bit in the middle and the less said about the end the better...but apart from that, brilliant."" The film is given no foundations from the outset. You don't really know why Indy and his colleagues are where they are, why the people that are after them are after them, or why indeed they first discover the 'Crystal Skull'. Worse, the new characters are never really introduced to us, meaning we don't really care what they do or why they do it.The only two characters we do know are used lazily. Indy spouts a few of the old lines and gets in a few boisterous scrapes (and it should be said, Harrison Ford does an excellent physical job for his age). And we are re-introduced to Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Karen Allen's re-appearance as this character was greeted in the cinema by a deafening indifference, not helped by the fact that she looks terrible in the film, her acting is atrocious and the film-makers seem to have forgotten that she spoke with an accent in ROTLA. Frankly, the relationship study between Jones and Ravenwood in the film is one of the most appalling I have ever seen, even by the sappy, simple standards of Hollywood blockbusters.Shia Le Beouf is his usual bright self in his role, but, like everyone else, his character has no real depth and is therefore two dimensional. It is not unfair to say that River Phoenix's portrayal of a young Indiana in The Last Crusade had far more depth and intrigue to it than the similar character Le Beouf is given here. And I believe both are a similar standard of young actor. As for Blanchett and Winstone, I would be amazed if anyone could tell me who they are supposed to be playing and for what reason after watching this film. Both do solid jobs, but what those jobs are is a bit of a mystery.In truth, there are some exciting and fun moments in the film, mainly in the first hour when Ford and Le Beouf are getting to know each other. But, without giving too much away, the film takes a turn for the ridiculous in several places, one of which is so irretrievable that it puts the film on a sharp downward gradient from where it only gets worse. The ending may leave you stunned for the wrong reasons.All this considered, there is something I would very much like to do. That is, sit in a room with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and ask them whether they honestly believe this film is in any way appropriate to be a part of the Indiana Jones series, falling way short as it does even of the Temple of Doom, the weakest of the first three. Because this film - like the third instalment of the Godfather - is a disgrace to the legacy of its predecessors. It has none of the detail, the humour or the drama of the previous films, and those were three of the most obviously vital ingredients.The film hints in places that Le Beouf will eventually take over the franchise from Ford. But what sort of franchise will be left? Before I saw the film, that would have excited me. Now, I'm hoping that this film is quietly ignored in future, and that we remember the Indiana Jones saga as it was - when all those involved were still hungry enough to care.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
676,bulletproofclod,How dare they?,10,23 May 2008,"The latest in the epic series of ""Indiana Jones"" has completely messed up my ideas behind the worthiness of a film due to its chronology. Before this installment, Raiders of the Lost Ark was by far my favorite, followed by The Temple of Doom and, in last place by far, The Last Crusade. Now Spielberg, Lucas and Ford came together again and made a complete mockery of my belief that movies and their sequels diminish in value by the order they are created. I'm happy to be wrong.The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull holds up to the hype, it has that old Indiana Jones feel surrounding it, with action, suspense, romance and the supernatural neatly tied into one explosive package. While The Last Ark is still, in my opinion, the best of the series, this forth installment certainly holds up to the precedent set by the previous films.Harrison Ford is amazing, even in his mid sixties he can give those Commies a run for their money. Cate Blanchett is a great villainess, Karen Allen is fantastic as Jones's returning love interest, even Shia LaBeouf, who I had reservations about, served the film well as a sort of aspiring tough guy who bumbles along the way. It's a must see, and those who are already whining and complaining need to take a deep breath and realize that all the elements that made the series great are still alive and well in this movie, though perhaps not quite so strong as in the beginning.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

678,Michael Laing,An empty experience,3,22 May 2008,"Well I must admit to being in shock. I had heard mixed reviews of the latest Indiana Jones film and went into the film not expecting much. Unfortunately my expectations were still far to high. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Cristal Skull is a wast of a film. I can't really think of anything decent to say about the film.The script is awful, George Lukas has always said that the most important part of an adventure film is to get the MacGuffin (the device that motivates the characters and story). But the MacGuffin just fails to work in any way in this film. I story was uninspiring, cringe worthy and totally unbelievable. It dialogue in the film is clunky at best, clumsy most of the time and even irritating.The action is unoriginal, dull, silly and unconvincing. I don't mind a when something is slightly unbelievable if it is done well but this takes stupidity to a whole new level.The acting generally was hammy with the only people who come close to being able to hold their head up high are Karen Allen and Ray Winstone, though even then the dialogue and story hampers them. Harrison Ford just isn't very interesting in the film. Cate Blanchett is unconvincing as the bad person and never scary.The music is very similar to the other film but because the action scenes don't work, the main theme feels out of place and over dramatic. The editing again feels clunky and is distracting. I didn't find the cinematography interesting and the green screen (there is a lot) is generally noticeable.As Lukas has got older he has lost his sparkle. He is a great producer but shouldn't be allowed near a script. What surprises me is that Spielberg agreed to make the film. I have a huge amount of respect for him but again seems to have lost something.The film is bad, I can't even be bothered to hate it. because it is so empty. It doesn't even have a big ending. In the end I just breath slowly and hold my head in my hands.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Im sure everyone has.Thinking back on the first 3 movies, over the top stunts, supernatural storyline (ark,stones,holy grail), and lots of over the top action, throw in some comedy, suspense, small amounts of horror (skeletons, dead bodies etc), and you got yourself a typical Indiana Jones movie.There's something missing, or there's a little too much. Im not sure. I understand the whole crystal skull thing, but I think that seeing the alien ship at the end was just a bit too much, and didn't really fit into an Indiana Jones movie. But it wasn't overdone in my opinion.But still it has all of the above that the other 3 movies have, its just.... different. Maybe its just cuz were older, and I have been waiting for this movie since I was 15, Im 28 now. I remember seeing in a magazine, that Indiana Jones 4 was coming out with a TBA next to it, so I have been waiting for this a long time, just like everyone else. Maybe all the time waiting, I was expecting it to be just like the first 3 movies, and no great special effects, that might have been the too much part of it.

There was a lot to enjoy in this movie; Harrison Ford is superb, and it's very refreshing to see him playing the role again. The in-jokes are also pretty witty! The action in places is spectacular, although it does sometimes take a while to reach it.I think the script could've used some work, as the bad guy lady just isn't menacing enough, and as someone else said, the bad guys are always one step behind - never ahead, which is a shame.The use of CGI is thankfully quite un-noticeable, but there are some scenes which are a bit over the top.

Other times (refering to the whole jungle chase, the story is exciting as the first film. => The film could have been better, but he is enjoyable.The scene with the red ants was perfect The only irritating thing was the accent of the Russians.

682,templer_doom-1,Better to end in a KINGDOM than on a CRUSADE....,7,3 June 2008,"I have never been truly satisfied with any of the RAIDERS sequels, since the original, like most people who saw it, is regarded as near-perfection. I feel a genuine sense of closure with this series, as four films were announced at the outset rather than the rumoured nine films STAR WARS was going to be (although if you count the CLONE WARS DVDs, that makes eight in total)Spielberg at least has the decency to begin the film with action rather than the prelude of 19 years of back-story, which is what the length of time is and we don't seem to get a sense of Indiana growing old gracefully as well as being on temporary retirement. However, there are moments where the film doesn't have the same kind of zest that personified the first film.It is pleasing to see that CRYSTAL SKULL, whilst still lacking much of what made the original film a classic, bouncing back with a bang. The opening US base sequence in which Indy has to find a magnetic statue whilst under threat from villainous Russkie Red spy (Cate Blanchett)does pay homage to the earlier films and has sufficient energy to satisfy, but given the immense rumours about plot and story, the film does better than expected.The trump card is of course seeing Karen Allen returning as Marion Ravenwood, still the best romantic sidekick and lover that Ford ever had, eclipsing Capshaw and Doody. Sadly though she doesn't appear until about half-way through the film, but provides enough to keep the fans happy.Shia LeBoeuf provides adequate support, but it still worries me that he is being lined up as a successor to Ford on this basis. Blanchett and Ray Winstone do OK, but lack the vicious psychological edge that Paul Freeman and Ronald Lacey kept giving Indy in the first film.John Williams scores another home-run with a variant on his classic 1981 score.Better to end it now than with other sequels.

683,mrusty5,Indy's Back and He's Still Great!,8,4 June 2008,"I've watched all three original films of the series and was thrilled when I found out a fourth one was in the making. And it was worth the wait. Henry Indiana Jones Junior brings out his hat and whip for another exciting installment, the first in nearly two decades. This time, Indy is older and things aren't as easy as they used to be. Now he, a motorcyclist named Mutt (played by Shia LaBeouf), his mother Marion Ravenswood (an excellent return), and crazy professor played by John Hurt to find the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls, or the City of Gold. However, Cate Blanchett plays a Soviet Union agent with a bowl haircut and a cool sword, and is after him. Ray Winstone and Jim Broadbent also appear.The film is great overall with an good but a little confusing plot line, great stunts and fight scenes, stunning special effects (some of which are still old school). However, a certain scene involving an army of ants is rather unpleasant. The best thing about the film is that it references to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade. Marcus Brody, Henry Jones Sr. and Willy all make photo cameos and even the Ark from the first film makes a brief appearance. I was disappointed though that Sallah did not appear.Overall, I recommend that fans of the films watch this film to relive the adventure and fun again if you watched the trilogy which has now become a quarter.One more thing: Indy named after the dog!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
684,Lord_Frog,I left the theatre with a huge grin on my face!,8,22 May 2008,"I was 9 when I first saw Raiders at the cinema... ever since I've been the biggest fan of the Indy series, watching them over and over again. After reading the mostly positive reviews, but disturbed by some of the negative ones, I finally saw it at midnight last night.As soon as Indy is on screen, bang you feel like you are a kid again. The opening sequence in Area 51 is amazing and hilarious - some may argue that Indy's escape is over the top and unbelievable, but every single movie in the series also asked for suspension of disbelief. Yes it was over the top but THIS IS AN INDY MOVIE, of course it has to be that way! I'd still like someone to explain how Indy goes from the submarine to the island in Raiders for instance... or how he even survives most of his adventures at all! The plane escape on an inflatable boat in Temple of Doom comes to mind, as well... this opening sequence is classic Indy, with amazing stunts and special effects.The Marshall College sequence had me grinning from ear to ear - from the classroom scene so reminiscent of Raiders and Last Crusade to the excellent motorbike chase. Shia LaBeouf is introduced there, and he's very good in the part and very funny.The middle section is a bit too long as some have noted, however I never found the film boring, even in its quieter moments.Then we're on to a non-stop thrill ride until the very end, with one of the best chase sequences in the series, almost matching the truck chase in Raiders. That jungle chase scene is a joy to watch, extremely inventive and spectacular. I do agree that a short scene involving Shia and monkeys was ridiculous though - thank God it's very short. But it stinks of George Lucas - a very Jar Jar Binks moment, but thankfully the only one in the film.As for the ending - well I love SF so it wasn't a problem for me and I thought it fit quite well with the series overall - let's say the Crystal Skull is a very different kind of ""religious"" artifact... well the natives at least would think of it as being religious lol. My only small gripe is that I wish that Cate Blanchett's demise would have been more spectacular and gory. The end did feel a bit rushed, but it is spectacular. I don't get the CGI complaints, of course there's going to be CGI nowadays, but the stunts are very real. CGI is saved for digital matte paintings, creepy crawlies that could not possibly have been trained to perform this way on cue, and of course the ending.It's as if people would complain at the end of Raiders if it was released today. ""The wrath of God?! Come on it's ridiculous, it would NEVER happen!!"" Well people who react like that can't possibly love the Indy series. Don't get me wrong the film has some flaws but all in all it's a great Indiana Jones movie, and I left the cinema very happy. As a matter of fact, I just booked my ticket to go back tonight.I would say it's the 3rd best of the series - I prefer it to Last Crusade which was great but didn't have enough action in my opinion compared with the other two movies. Crystal Skull is full of it, and very funny as well. There are references to all 3 movies and it's great to see Karen Allen again!

I saw ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" back in the day at a sneak preview, and I gave it a good review -- but this movie is a piece of crap.In the first film, events were more or less believable. Well, forget about believability in this movie. Here, Indiana Jones isn't just an archaeologist/teacher, he's some kind of superhero. This film is filled with action sequences that could never happen, incredible coincidences, junk science, and general nonsense. Does anyone believe that you could pull someone out of quicksand (or whatever it was) with a snake? And why would you send the crazy guy off to get help when the only people around were the ones trying to catch you? And that just covers about 5 minutes of the film.If you think about it, the plot is essentially the same as ""Raiders""! Just change the Nazis to Commies and the Ark to the Crystal Skull, and there you have it. This movie should have been so much better -- it has a great cast (Cate Blanchett, fer Chrissake!, not to mention Karen Allen and John Hurt), and impressive special effects.

687,namideo,I think I'll just stick with the original trilogy.,4,27 September 2008,"It's been 19 years since the last one. No doubt, many an Indy fan has been eagerly anticipating this fourth installment. Unfortunately, I really wish I could say that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull lives up to expectations. I really do, but sadly, it doesn't even come close.George Lucas proves once again he is the expert when it comes to killing a classic franchise. Although, I wasn't expecting much from Lucas, and besides, he wasn't the director. It's mostly Spielberg who disappoints me. The only ones who come through for us are the actors, especially Harrison Ford, who after having many doubters, proves he can still crack a whip and pack a punch almost as well as he did 20 years ago. Seeing Karen Allen again is a delight, and even Shia LaBoeuf comes through in this film. The problem lies mostly with the script; basically a rehash of every other Spielberg film ever made, filled in with cliché after cliché, and constantly littered with little gags and jokes that fall flat most of the time. Even the dialogue itself seems to be strongly lacking. Anyone who loves to quote Indiana Jones movies is going to find a shortage of memorable lines in this one. The story also doesn't hold itself together particularly well, and tends to become overshadowed with scenes of spectacle that have little to know purpose in the film.The action has its moments of excitement and creativity, but hindered by the constant use of CGI. It's obvious that the film's key action sequence was filmed entirely with a green screen. Film critic Joe Morgenstern says in his review, ""sure, computers can do anything these days, but do we really want them to?"" And I wholeheartedly agree. Crystal Skull does indeed accomplish visuals that would have been impossible 20 years ago. The irony is, these ""special"" effects completely fail to live up to what we saw in Indy's previous adventures, like that mine car chase in Temple of Doom, that was filmed with a model.What breaks my heart the most is that the film doesn't seem to be taken the least bit seriously. Any hint of reality that was apparent in the other Indy films is thrown completely out the window in this one. The fantasy is stretched beyond this world (literally) and there is a complete disregard of physics, that has audiences laughing hysterically, but not for the right reasons.If had to sum up this film's flaws, I would boil it down to the filmmakers trying too hard to make an Indiana Jones movie, rather than focusing on just making a good, decent film, period. Rather than be creative and daring, they repackage what was popular in other films and sell it under the presumption of what they think people want to see, and as everyone knows, that only leads to disaster.I admit, my expectations for this movie were not extremely high, but I did not think it could possibly be as bad as it was.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
688,VoyagerSamfan87,Indy is still the same!,10,27 May 2008,"Don't listen to the haters. I think the haters have to rewatch the movies again. Indy never takes itself seriously but the fans do. True Raiders of the Lost Ark made Indy into a household name but most of the time the humor is slapstick and that's what we got here. The humor was spot on along with the plot and the writing. When I rewatched the Last Crusade after watching Indy 4 I was amazed of how spot on it really was. I think people's main problem is that they have such a fond memory of Indy as a child they don't realize how blunt and light the humor is because they weren't as cynical as kids. Those that say the magic have died, isn't true. It may have died for them because they are now big critics who like to moan and complain about anything but the magic is still there along with it's innocence. It never takes itself too seriously. Ignore all the haters. Go see it for yourself. I left with a big grin on my face. Indy is back! And I hope I can see more of Shia and Harrison's adventures together. Or Maybe Shia could be the new Indy...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
689,Kate_Dammit_Run,The Last Crusade Should Have Been last,4,3 August 2008,"The Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls is a disappointment of a movie and a lackluster capstone to the Indiana Jones franchise. Arguably Spielberg and Lucas, who are both past their prime, waited too long to do the film.First, the items I liked.-I liked the sense of the passage of time. Spielberg and co don't try and pretend that this is still the 30s and Indy is the same age as in Last Crusade. They acknowledge the passage of time. I like setting it in the 50s and I especially like the sense of history that they give Indy in this. There's a whole decade of Indy's life that we only get tantalizing hints of here. He was active in WWII with the OSS. He's even got a good and old friend George Mac McHale who we've never met before.I like the CONCEPT of the Soviets as the villains. Although since much of the movie takes place in South America they could easily have used Nazi hold outs as the villains. Indeed, recovering the crystal skulls in order to ressurrect the Nazi empire would have made a good motivation. But the Soviets are a nice change and the inclusion of Cate Blanchett as a psychic Soviet is a nice concept.Now for what I didn't like: -While the Soviets are good in theory the execution is poor. We hardly get to know anything about Blanchetts character. Also, while the bad guys are now Soviets they are indistinguishable in appearance, dress, and character from the Nazis of the previous films. Why change the characters if you're not going to change them? -The plot feels very abreviated from the previous films. There don't seem to be all the twists and turns and complications that we expect from an Indiana Jones film.-Shia Laboeuf isn't very good as Mutt. He was fine as a kid in comedy fare but he doesn't have the dramatic presence to fit in here, particularly since he's supposed to be a tough ""greaser"" character.-The action often doesn't work. They don't seem to undeerstand the balance which kept the action in the previous films light and enjoyable. Here much of it comes off as farcical such as the extended jeep surfing scenes and one where Shia Laboeuf swings on vines like Tarzan.-Indy is showing his age. Harrison Ford is almost 70 years old and he's showing it. When the last film was made he was 47 and still in pretty good shape. Now he looks a bit ridiculous performing some of the stunts and many of them were likely scaled back because of his age.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
690,paulmg,A great adventure,9,2 June 2008,"The initial moments of my first time seeing ""Crystal Skull"" reminded me very much of my first time seeing ""Last Crusade."" I grew up on Indy and Star Wars. One of my earliest memories is of going to see the original ""Star Wars"" in '77 at the age of 4, a good couple years before it had ""A New Hope"" attached to its title. Likewise I saw ""Raiders"" in '81 at the age of 8, and it has since become my favorite movie of all time.But a funny thing happened on the way to ""The Last Crusade."" I sat there for most of the movie feeling as if it weren't an Indiana Jones film. Perhaps because I'd watched the two previous films so many times and they were so familiar, but I didn't take to ""Last Crusade"" immediately. It took me multiple viewings. In fact, it wasn't until well after it was on home video that I began to feel it was an Indy movie. Which seems to be the reaction that many are having to ""Crystal Skull."" I did initially as well when the film started. But about five minutes in something happened. Doors opened revealing a familiar setting from the original ""Raiders,"" and I was immediately transported back into the world of Indiana Jones. Only this time the world is not about Nazis and religious artifacts. At least, not any religion we're familiar with. It's no longer the 30s, the world has moved on. This is exemplified by a shot of Indy standing on a hill as a mushroom cloud billows in the distance. The world has changed. The man who has always made it up as he went along is in a world where it's hardly safe to do so anymore.A great deal has been made of the Maguffin of the film, and the fact that the supernatural element of this particular installment owes more to some other films Spielberg has made than to other Indy films. While I agree, I believe people are completely missing the point. The Indy films have always been throwbacks to the period in which the films occur, mimicking the popular culture of its time. The 50s was a time of McCarthyism, Communism, alien invasion films such as ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" (both of which ""Crystal Skull"" references), Tarzan, Howdy Doody and Elvis. The film is a product of the 50s, not the 30s. The world has moved on to new threats, and so has Indy. The film is true to what the series has always been while moving Indy into a fantastic and over-the-top yet real exploration of the media of the time.The film is a great adventure. The action is some of the best of the series, it has a great deal of humor and warmth, the chemistry between Shia and Harrison is fantastic, and as always it's great to see Marion back. As a huge fan of the original, I am perhaps a bit biased, but I would place this as my second favorite in the series after ""Raiders."" Listening to the soundtrack and thinking about the film I frequently find myself smiling thinking about it, and look forward very much to seeing it again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
691,SeussMeTub,Vintage Indy But Nothing New,6,22 May 2008,"George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford team up for another Indiana Jones adventure in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull- how good is it? Well, its great to see Indy again but I find it the weakest in the series so far Indy's adventures have now fast forwarded from the pre-World War II years to the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although it helps to explain the fact that Ford is playing an older character, one can't help but feel the saga of Indiana Jones is missing something (I wish they would make a movie set in World War II but it will obviously be a tall order with Ford being his age- perhaps with future technology they could make him younger like what they did with Ray Winstone in Beowulf) since so many years have passed. Although Indy is now much, much older he can still fight it out and win against people half his age it seems- the plot this time revolves around the Russians and their quest using a crystal skull to find a lost city somewhere in South America.Since Ford has gotten older (I know, I know, that remark is getting thin), he is joined by a younger, rebellious James Dean type named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf- his character's name is an in-joke based on Indy's name) who is a qualified fencer and takes after Marlon Brando's Wild One with his Harley Davidson motorcycle. Karen Allen also marks a return as Marion Ravenwood (Indy's old flame from Raiders of the Lost Ark) and her scenes with Ford are nearly pulled off to perfection but Lucas and Spielberg unfortunately play it more for light laughs rather than poignancy; Allen is important to the story since Denholm Elliot and Sean Connery no longer appear in the movie even though their characters are mentioned a number of times- it makes one miss them even more. The aforementioned Ray Winstone also appears as Mac- Indy's new British sidekick- although there is more to his character as he appears.The bad guys are led by Irina Spalko (played by Cate Blanchett wearing a black wig) who herself happens to be a fencer as well- her trademark rapier is in contrast to Indy's trademark bullwhip.What did I not like? Well, since Ford's Indiana Jones is such a cultural icon now Spielberg and Lucas would never ever even attempt to kill off this character and it shows- although Indy is exposed to danger constantly we are never made to fear that he is (or any of his friends) are in danger at all; Raiders of the Lost Ark introduced him so he was new to us while Temple of Doom gave us some real frights as to whether he would live on while everyone was afraid for Connery in Last Crusade- but with this latest installment clearly elevating Indy as an immortal character you knew he would pull out in the end.The action sequences are frenetic and well made as usual but they don't break new ground- we have seen Indy going after convoys full of soldiers to get what he wanted before, after all. Other than the first action sequence in Area-51, we no longer even see Indy use his bullwhip any more.Although it is great to see Indy back, I hope they don't go with Lucas' plan to replace Ford with the younger LaBeouf- his character doesn't seem very smart or talented at finding clues like Indiana Jones. All in all, an above average movie with the ever likable Ford as Indy though I wish they would have tried something new or daring rather than just go for the formulaic treasure hunt.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
692,BlackTaterTotallyBlue,Indiana Jones & The Wet Fart Of Disappointment,4,26 May 2008,"With regards to the first three, I'm a big fan. Even 'Doom' has it's moments. For sure, the minute you start to question realism in these movies, you're lost. The thing falls apart and you've wasted the price of a ticket. So, any argument that begins with 'I just don't believe' or 'that would never happen' is already null and void. When you go see an Indy movie, you leave that stuff in the foyer. As far as believability goes, yes, this one steps dangerously over the line even for an Indy movie. But that's not the real problem. It's also worth pointing out that 'Doom' being centered around a Thuggee cult in India was perhaps the most 'realistic' of the three, but also easily the weakest (until now...).So, if you haven't seen it yet and you've never seen an Indy movie - go and watch 'Raiders' instead. If you have, no-one could dissuade you from going, but you will be disappointed. My advice is to save your money for Batman: Dark Knight, or even X-files 2 - both will most likely be much better than this. Talking of which, this time, we're firmly in the realm of the X-files. However, X-files was occasionally successful because it often presented the issue of little green men with reserved distance and a modicum of well judged scientific seriousness, much like (to a greater extent) Spielberg's own 'Close Encounters'. Indy, on the other hand, has always been about the ride, Saturday Matinée thrills & spills rather than overt chin rubbing. So, while in principle, I've no problem with this subject matter, it doesn't belong in an Indiana Jones movie. One of the ideas on the table was the City of Alantis. Better. More Indy.Yes, I smiled. I even laughed sometimes, but the majority of those gags are only likely to work on the fans, because they're self referential. They're same kind of chuckles that are brought on by your uncle telling the same old gags he tells every Xmas. They get less amusing every year, but you laugh anyway. Funnily enough, the whole film feels like a hokey Xmas reunion, remember the Star Wars holiday special? The ultimate in badly done self parody, this is at least better than that - but it's not a million miles away.Frankly, it all went wrong in the first 10 seconds. Spielberg said he wanted to take it back to the gritty, seat of your pants style of the first three. A mountain of dirt forms the paramount logo. Then comes... A FRIKKIN CUTE CGI GOPHER!!! WHAT?!? This has George Lucas written all over it. In fact, did anyone notice how it even looked a bit like Lucas? The distinct lack of a chin made it a dead ringer. From here on in, the litany of misdemeanours is endless. Indy in a persil white T-shirt shooting the breeze with Jim Robinson? Sure, they had T-shirts in the 50's but... it just feels wrong. And Jim Robinson has come a long way from Ramsay st. He must have the best agent in the world. Bouncer's dream indeed.And the spaces. Spaces are important in an Indy movie: Castles, tombs, temples, palaces, caves etc. Notably one person who didn't rejoin the crew for this film was Production Designer Norman Reynolds. It shows. His work was always memorable from Marion's bar in Nepal and the 'Well Of Souls' in Raiders to the Ventian library and the final resting place of the cup of Christ in Crusade. These spaces are unforgettable, cinematic and distinct. You can recall them long after seeing the movie. This film had a succession of utterly forgettable boxes that felt very 'TV'. The warehouse? A big box filled with little boxes. The CIA interrogation room? Oxley's cell? Uninspiring boxes. The place where they find the skull? An underground box, and the skull is just unceremoniously lying in the corner. The camp in Peru? A square. The swamp? A square sand pit in a studio. You get my point. It feels lazy. The last space with the 13 aliens was mildly interesting. At least it wasn't a box.While on paper, bringing back Marion Ravenwood seemed like a good idea, it wasn't. The chemistry is flat, and her part was written with all the charm of a brick. Similarly, the mighty John Hurt was woefully underused and looked like a fifth wheel with the air let out. On the up side, Harrison was in good shape. Had he been fed better lines, he would have been just fine. Sure, he's getting on a bit, but he certainly doesn't look ridiculous, as some had feared. He IS Indy (unless you put him in a T-shirt). Also, it's easy to see why Spielberg is so happy about Shia Lebeouf, he's a real talent. The nuclear test site sequence was genius. And the punch up amongst killer ants was the part that truly felt like a proper Indiana Jones movie. But, for every one of these good things, there are several bad ones: Kung fu 'zombies'? Shia Lebeouf swinging, tarzan style, on vines with CGI monkeys? And that ending? Unforgivably daft. Therein lies the answer to what's wrong with this fourth installment. While it's a almost a prerequisite for an Indy movie to have unbelievable things that probably couldn't happen in reality, there should always be a balance. Maybe they could have tackled even this subject matter if they'd done it right, and walked that tightrope, but when things are more silly than fun, more referential than original and more like a video game than an action sequence then it isn't Indiana Jones any more. It's The Mummy or Tomb Raider. Or worse, as 007 is Indy's spiritual father, then it is perhaps appropriate to draw comparison with another self parodying abomination: 'Die Another Day'?That's not good enough - because we've waited too long, with reason to expect far better.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
693,mpless,Don't let Lucas write again. EVER! (Possible spoilers),3,8 June 2008,"As soon as I saw the opening credits with George Lucas as the writer, I feared this would be an unremarkable, poorly-scripted pastiche of tired old ideas thrown together. As it stands, I was to be proved right, but I didn't know worse was to come......in the form of Cate Blanchett's appalling pseudo Russian accent, mixed with what appeared to be at times, Scottish, Australian, German, and goodness-knows what else. Her character was almost entirely superfluous after the opening scenes, and perhaps this is a reason she gave what must be a worst-of-career performance. Even she has been publicly critical of her attempts at an accent....in the guise of dreadful story-telling with Lucas' favorite clichés thrown at the audience in predictable, unimaginative ways. Thank goodness he didn't have the aliens playing pop music on strange instruments, a la Star Wars!...in the attempts at humor which at times devolved into sheer stupidity, devoid of entertainment.Harrison Ford finds himself in the company of what looks to be a James Dean/Marlon Brando wannabe, after escaping from psychopathic Russian spies in a totally implausible way. Presently, despite being all-but accused of subversion by his own government, Ford and his new partner are again pursued by aforementioned Russians, although followed is more appropriate.In the company of the said Brando-ette and later, John Hurt as a somewhat demented colleague (who miraculously gains his senses after the denouement) and Karen Allen, they embark on a quest that features large waterfalls, car chases, fisticuffs aplenty, and a scene that could have been stolen from The Mummy using large and unconvincing computer-generated ants. Perhaps this is the greatest flaw in the film: an effective story requires suspension of disbelief. To enjoy this movie requires its total annihilation.As you'd expect from a Spielberg film, the actors try hard, and at least in the action sequences, Ford acquits himself well despite his age. Karen Allen provides a degree of near-manic expression at times and John Hurt was totally wasted, for Allen's role at least served some function through the movie.Of course, there are the obligatory ancient devices that have survived for centuries whilst remaining in perfect working order  these are the stuff of many adventure movies.That I nearly fell asleep several times says much for the lack of suspense and interest in the film.I gave it a very low rating for this and the fact there have been several adventure movies recently that have trumped it without being exceptional  most notably the National Treasure duo.In all, there is little to commend this movie, and if this had been the first in the series, it would certainly have ensured there were no others. A sad fall for such a loved hero.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
694,robertwb,Magic in short supply this time around.,6,4 July 2008,"As the lights in the cinema dimmed I waited with baited breath; how will it begin? How will they incorporate the Paramount logo, what will be our first glimpse of Indy and what will he say? There it was, the Paramount logo and it turned into... a prairie dog mound of earth. Okkkaaaayyy. Then a CG prairie dog appeared and I knew we were in trouble.It's interesting how the Judaeo-Christian artifacts, the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail, seemed to get the more 'serious' (for want of a better term) treatment out of the four Indy films. The Shankara Stones and the crystal skulls come across as more jokey and comic book-like, as if because they aren't 'real' (from a Western point of view) they get a less 'serious' narrative.There were too many side kicks, too many dusty, dark temples and too many by-the-numbers action sequences. The narrative was all over the place and, like the later Star Wars films, the story was muddled and sometimes confusing.The first three Indy films worked so well because they didn't use CG, the filmmakers had to actually go out and find real locations to do their stunts. I'm referring to the car/truck chase through the jungle and near the cliff edge in 'Skull' here. You could see it was all blue screen, CG and manipulation, and it suffered as a result.However, the car/truck chase in the desert in 'Raiders' when Indy has the Ark onboard and is fending off the Nazis is spectacular because we know it was, for the most part, real. No studios or computer wizardry, just good old fashioned film-making.Cate Blanchet was fun to watch in Russian Domme garb but it was pretty much a one note-character and soon grew tired.On the plus side, Harrison looked great and really seemed to be enjoying being back in the hat. His performance was well worth the price of admission.All up the film came across as a parody of Indy, a send up even. It felt like the whole concept had been dumbed down somewhat, the edges smoothed off and made cute and, unfortunately, corny.I still love you all though.

696,yodaschoda,We Always Destroy the Things We Love,4,13 March 2019,"There are/were few franchises in the movie universe which were so complete, so singular in their quality as the Indiana Jones series. Perhaps because Lucas and Speilberg were cutting their teeth durring it's inception. Perhaps because the pair was hungry. Perhaps because the rules and formulas were not quite as prevalent as the have begun now... And yes, perhaps because I've lost some of the child like naivety which made nearly all movies wonders to behold. But, be all that as it may... This movie proved to be such a huge disapointment on so many levels that I refuse to see it as cannon to the previous trilogy.The story feels forced, unoriginal, and quite frankly boring. All things which should never be associated with a lineage such as this. Even some of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles had more integrity then this movie...The transition from still frame special effects, which should have provided a new feel to the franchise, but only served to illustrate how far the medium has fallen. Speilberg, who once said that special effects are best when subtle, showed little restrait... The results are agrandized, exagerated, and flatnout ridiculous effects. Effects which were used to produce scenarios so absurd they border on the non-sensical. A key component of the original movies were stunts which allowed viewers to imagine they were real... They were ""possible"", which made them fantastic! These new sequences leave little of this magic as viewers are left with little illusions as to the impossibility of them.Having come at a time where Lucas was looking at selling his works, one has to wonder if his ego secretly attempted to sabotage the franchise... I can only hope that any future movies within this frachise bring it back to where it once was. As of now, it lies broken on the floor...

697,skradji,"Nostalgia, deception and clear, resignation",5,26 June 2015,"I love Indiana Jones. One character that has marked me more. As a child I swallowed more than two hundred times each of the three installments and not exaggerating, really.It was amazing, the university professor of history was going to be a formal suit and tie man donning jacket, hat and whip and be the most intrepid adventurer in the world, in search of legendary items of unimaginable power, surviving crowd traps, enemies and seducing the pretty girl at the end .... blew my fantasy at all levels, I wanted to be like him, dodging the Nazis in race against time to seize the Ark of the Covenant, defeat the evil Mola Ram and liberate the poor kids locked in the dark and horrible catacombs of an ancient temple in India, ride with Marcus and Salah from the arid sands of Jordan until the mystical ruins of Petra to find the Holy Grail ... . I wanted to be Indiana Jones.But the best is that unlike other sagas is not degenerated as he advanced but remained an almost identical level of quality entertainment and spectacle offering a gripping story in each of those deliveries, always directed with skill, talent and energy by Spielberg. Therefore, for the wonderful and priceless great moments that these films put me through, I could not help being moved to infinity with the premiere of the fourth installment, which did not hesitate to go see the day of its launch like crazy ready to reconnect with my teenager once again ..... but something did not go as expected.The feelings I had were strange. On the one hand he saw an entertaining film, with its dose of visual spectacle, action and an Indy, but more aged as well played as always by Ford, but again, something had failed.And that something is the soul. This new story just does not connect to the above. In the first three installments we had were stories about legends and mythology about mysterious objects or magic or supernatural artifacts. Here however the tone of fantasy by pure science fiction breaks. The plot touches on aliens, spaceships and other ships, but that's not all, as we also see mental powers, seers, a Martian alive and kicking and even a dimensional door. OK. Not that argument seems to me the idea or bad, what happens is that is very different from what he had seen and expected to see.Everything changes. The charming and classic era of the 30s turn to the gray 50s during the Cold War. Of the wicked but more interesting (on the big screen, EYE) had a stony Nazis, disturbing and unattractive Russians. Adventure seeking divine objects, we turn to stories of UFOs, Martians, telepathic powers, ultimately, the series has changed, and we are the same.Another aspect that stands out is the sense of humor that permeates the film. At times it is wise to make a joke, or even a little parody on fair dose reduction is always good because the tension of the plot. But in this case I think they go through thanks. Many simply have no grace or spare, and I think so laugh and joke taken as casually as the subject ends up affecting the drama and realism frame making it difficult to take it seriously.All this is a point I want to stress, it is more important than it may seem. Spielberg has grown old. But I do not just mean old, but in power. Having used many digital effects when it stated that the minimum would be used, not having shot in foreign locations as was done in the three previous films and that the pace of the plot have ups and downs and gets done something dull and heavy, is a clear indication of an already wealthy veteran filmmaker who has lost some of its verve, nerve and desire for success, to amaze with each scene, or frame making it performs, though at the end does give the film a coherent ¨ mounting and undeniable touch that many current directors are unable to give their films, which resemble more to music and peak hour so crazy montages anyone dizzy. Spielberg, nevertheless, continues to lead the old and it shows in many scenes, especially the truck, and that action is or is something that is appreciated him greatly, because they are losing each passing day. spoiler: As for the cast, I almost left me, Karen Allen makes a wonderful, unexpected and nostalgic return to, Shia LaBeouf saga I like him, not as repellent as many other brat, Cate Blanchet best of the role as a villain and together they meet but fail to really shine, lacking as more connection to the story and its characters, especially Karen Allen who does not seem to have much chemistry with Ford as in the past .... but anyway, you can not have all right ?, and years, unfortunately, they spare no one.My final opinion on the film is uneven. If I analyze it as entertainment, it is excellent, with spectacular moments, great special effects, story ..... properly drawn a great adventure film.But in the aftermath of the saga strange encounter. With a crazy story, ups and downs of pace, supposedly spectacular moments that do not work, a change of tone too strong, like watching Indiana Jones against a UFO hovering, is an element for me too radical plot, difficult things to believe like the refrigerator for nuclear explosion no one who creates and much unnecessary humor seriously undermines the whole.Finally both leaving and roll, I think I will say simply that it is not a bad film itself, but is by far the worst of the saga, period.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
698,JustStone,"Go ahead, nuke the fridge.",5,8 April 2010,"It was about an hour and 20 minutes into ""Indiana Jones & the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" that I officially gave up on it. Prior I had tolerated the film's, how do you say... extreme implausibilitys, but it wasn't until Shia LaBeouf started swinging around on jungle vines with CGI monkeys that I rose my fists in anger and cursed the man once known as George Lucas for destroying my last fond childhood memories from his films. And I say the man once known as George Lucas because I'm convinced the man we see today isn't him, but a George Lucas android that killed and replaced the real Lucas probably around 1996.I had such (unrealistically) high hopes for this film even though it should never have been made. There is a reason why the last film was called ""Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade"", because it was suppose to be his last freakin' crusade. And the original trilogy in my mind is near perfect, why mess with it? Yet Hollywood and nostalgia ignored this and collectively cried out, ""we want one more""... even if one more was a bad idea. But for a film that yielded over 10 rejected screenplay drafts, countless writers/rewriters, and needed the approval of Lucas, Spielberg and Harrison Ford, it should have held somewhat of a candle to the originals. Mind you Lucas is an android, but I expected Spielberg and Ford wouldn't jump on board unless it was something worth both their prestigious careers and the legacy of the Indiana Jones Trilogy. But not even the director of Shindler's List could save this film from falling in the traps of George Lucas's last ego crusade.Right from the beginning of the film you realize what this film was really made and built for; nostalgia. Its like George Lucas and writer David Koepp took a syringe, borrowed the DNA of the original films and cloned it wrong (just like Jurassic Park, irony!). There is nothing new to be found here that we already haven't seen in the originals, and its like looking through a picture album by revisiting old scenes and scenarios (the secret relic warehouse anyone?). This also plays true with Indy himself; once he appears on screen for the first time in 19 years, it seems as if he's been risen from the dead. This is partially due to the generic storyline, but mostly because Indiana Jones is so out of place as an adventurer in his early 60's in the 1950's, you can almost sense how forced Harrison feels playing him. Lets get something straight; what made the originals so classic were not only the daring adventures Indy went on in 1930's, but his irresistible charm and charisma with the leading lady. Instead Indy gets stuck with Shia ""Mutt Williams"" LaBeouf, who doesn't even get a chance to be half as charming as his father (whoops don't read that), and can't compete with saucy dialogs of a young Indy with a dame. To compensate for this they make Indiana near invincible, which makes no sense since he should be much more brittle in his old age.Oh and then there is the whole element and the storyline of the aliens, which is a cop out in itself, because Indiana Jones usually deals with the spiritual, not the supernatural. I guess its fine when you have a script thrown together with references and reliance on the previous films, doesn't expect you to take any of the scenes seriously, and plays out its drama in a haphazardly inconsequential way, what's the difference if aliens exist or not in the Indiana Jones universe? Maybe George Lucas had all this planned out (like he usually claims he does) and Indiana is actually Han Solo's great great grandfather, and the Indiana Jones films is the pre-prequels to the Star Wars prequels. Ah ha, it's all adding up. You can't fool me android George Lucas.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Because the UFO-thing? Actuelly I thought it was pretty cool. Weird a bit but I liked that idea. Or Shia? In my opinion Shia is a good young actor. He's funny and cool, etc. I'd like to see him in more movies. Or...Maybe Cate Blanchett the weak point of the movie? I don't think so. She was just perfect! Not an Oscar-worthy performance but who's expecting that from an Indy movie? She's evil and that's it. Plain and simple. God bless Spielberg for the old school action sequences, I was on the edge of my seat while I watching the jungle chase but not just that scene, all of the action scenes was awesome! A little CGI was there (and don't blame Lucas for that!) but I didn't notice them.You see, as the big man (Spielberg) said the Indiana Jones-movies are ""B""-movies but with a budget of an ""A""-movie. If you like ""B""-movies you are gonna like this movie or the other Indy-flicks. I think that too. Turn off your brain and just enjoy! Indy rules!!!!! As good as the old episodes of the series!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
701,juliomontoya2000,Worn out idea,6,22 May 2008,"The first half of the movie is boring. The real action begins halfway through, but it's not that exciting. The movie is unfunny, everything that is supposed to make you laugh is forced and stupid.The best part of the movie is near the end, when the adventure culminates with a grand finale. But the only reason it's impressive is because it's special effects. And computer special effects have never been the main reason for the existence (and success) of the series.By the way, there's another impressive CGI: an atomic explosion at the beginning. Only we are left to wonder: was it necessary? It's not that is offensive. It's just that I think is a filler.Ray Winstone is wasted in a clichéd role. John Hurt is simply out of place for an actor of his stature. Harrison Ford is still adequate for the character, he doesn't spoil the movie, as many would fear. But is really little that you can do in a movie which formula seems tired and unoriginal.Sean Connery's decision of not to participate in this movie might be the wisest, since Keanu Reeves discarding Speed 2.To throw a little X-files topic in the mix may have seemed a good idea, but they didn't know how to execute it. That's the problem with digesting a bad idea for a long time: out of exhaustion, it may seem like a good thing at some point. This is exactly what happened with this movie. As such, it should have never been released.Be honest, Indiana Jones buffs. This one represents something different: in your heart, you know that is the first movie that you would not recommend. It's not up to the standard of the series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
702,DeathByTelevision,George Lucas should retire from the creative side of film-making,3,24 May 2008,"I have no problems with the fact that this movies is set in the fifties, and as a result the feel of the movie is going to be different. I liked the idea that it would be inspired by fifties science fiction and the cold war scare. Unfortunately, the execution is so muddled with things that can't be overlooked, that the fun gets sucked out of the experience.On the plus side, the action is nearly nonstop. Unfortunately, the convoluted story is more than the film needs or wants. I also realize that the series is a tribute to old action serials, but Indy and crew make it out of so many situations unscathed, that it made it eventually made it impossible for me to watch them with any sense of suspense.(SPOILER ALERT) After hundreds,if not thousands, of missed shots by the bad guys, going over three waterfalls without a hitch, including one that was roaring like Niagra, and completing a Thelma and Louise-style cliff jump without second thought, I was at my limit by the time I saw the flying saucer.Mr. Lucas, please have no involvement in the story the next time you do anything. PLEASE!

703,rlhaag,Good but Could Have been Better and more original,5,26 May 2008,"First let me say I loved the first movie. It was very original however this is where I will start my review. Instead of making an ground breaker George Lucas seemed in my opinion relied on the other movies. I noticed the familiar theme to national treasure in this movie. I think George Lucas has been very intimated by the National Treasure movies. Also, the alien stuff was pure x-files. Remember the ending to the movie X Files? Well the space ship coming out of the Amazon was so close to that it did stretch the imagination. Chris Carter should be flattered that George Lucas complimented him by imitating the scene where both ships take off. My wife and talked about this point on the way home. Harrison Ford has changed so much that it would not be a stretch that someone else could have played indy. Karen Allen just did not seem to have the feisty spirit as she did in the first movie. One things I did enjoy was we found the location of Ark. Also, funny was indy getting caught in the Atomic Testing grounds and hiding in the fridge. All in all and enjoyable movie but not a great one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This movie was terrible, just awful, and it took them how many years to make it?!?! Unbelievable. The first one was great, the next two were good and then almost great, then years of waiting, during which they made some pretty decent Young Indiana Jones Chronicles TV shows, then this flaming turdball of a movie that could have been written by a sixth grade creative writing class. It made no sense, the dialogue was awful, the new Mutt character is seriously annoying (then again I can't stand that actor he also stinks up the place in Transformers 1 and 2), and the effects are all so terrible it's absurd. What were they even trying to do here? Too bad they made money on this based on people like me going to see something hopefully almost as good as the first three were, now they will probably make a part five. I won't be fooled again though. I stopped watching Star Wars after the first prequel (even worse than this reboot!) and I won't watch another IJ project as long as I live. Truly horrible.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
705,alexsafc123,One of the better films of the year,7,28 May 2008,"Wow what is up with the continuing of old adventure franchises? Contrary to my initial gut instinct, the same as with Rocky Balboa and the 4th Rambo and Die Hard 4.0, these films have proved to be nearly as good as the originals. This film in particular has not lost the same sense of adventure and excitement I first experienced when watching the classic Indiana Jones films for the first time.First the few bones I have to pick with Mr Lucas and Spielberg. Firstly why were Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles enlisted to train the KGB how to shoot? I know Indy never used to get shot in the old films either but when you have an machine gun literally 5 feet away form someone I find it gob-smackingly hard to believe that you can miss.Also the scene when Indy survived a nuclear bomb test by hiding inside a pretty flimsy lead lined fridge, and after being flung hundreds of meters at great speed and managed to simply walk away unscathed was just ridiculous. A quick chemical shower later he was perfectly fine to continue his crusade against communism after a quick chat to the janitor from scrubs.Also the ending felt wrong to me. I know that the involvement of extra terrestrial life is still a much debated theory as to how some ancient structures were created but to have a giant C.G. inter-dimensional spaceship fly up from the ground in the middle of South America was a little too far for my liking. I couldn't help but think that they might have just had some extra cash left over at the end so they blew it on special effects where I felt it would have been much better to end it on a more plausible or simple conclusion to the quest.I could go on about the unrealistic action sequences or the few hiccups in the plot but they didn't bother me. The main purpose of this film was to entertain, and I can honestly say job very well done on that one. The numerous fights and chases, although sometimes a little over the top, were incredibly good fun and were unimpaired in keeping you on the edge of your seat. All of the actors performed well and there were more than enough well executed gags to keep the atmosphere of the film up beat.Definitely one of the better films of this year so far, a must see for and fans of the series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
706,GoldmundX,A mediocre copy of what it should have/ could have been,5,24 May 2008,"Yes we expect crazy chases, fights on moving objects, nifty levers that put whole stone structures into transformer mode. And yes, that we get. But Indy was something more, he was inspired, he was witty, he was clumsy as a professor, audacious as an adventurer. And in The Last Crusade he was at his best and his sidekicks made him shine. There was chemnistry and you cared, for they cared. And you believed it and you went for a crazy ride. It felt true and good. And I hoped they could have maintained at the very least that level of quality. But they failed. I saw Harrison Ford not as Indiana Jones, but as an actor acting that he was Indiana Jones. The sidekicks I couldn't care for. They were quite unsympathetic actually, not like Marcus or Indy senior before. I liked those characters. Here we get a doublecrosser and quite an arrogant hotshot dumped in our laps. And then Marion returns, a bit bitter, but then set on fixing a midlife crisis by reviving an old romance. All of them not very likable and not quite capable of bringing the best out of Indy. And then we get some cheesy riddles to solve, that tend to be solved by contemplating them for a minute at most. And then we have a moral: too much knowledge is bad for you, it can blow your mind. Too bad the producers truly believe that, as they didn't venture to show or expand their knowledge of what made Indy great. They focused on the superficial stuff. And that is really too bad. But I still rated it a 5, as the superficial stuff was still pretty good, but as they took the soul out of it, which was at least halve, I give it a 5. But it saddens me to see a good man fade away without much grace. Yes, they will go on, they introduced us the new Indy, fresh and eager, impulsive and a bit of a show off. Indy was more subtle than that. Alas, we can always cherish the good old feeling the real Indy gave us.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

But what meters of judgement you? Spoken with the alleged critics! E 'shameful read on a website of its kind ratings so low, push people not to consult more! When the film came out in cinemas Americans and Europeans that a few weeks ago the judgement of this movie within this site was 8.7! Now I did not understand why voting is precipitated in this way. While the Indian Jones earlier have received very high ratings. I believe that by a good slice of the alleged critics there is a certain nostalgia for the past and a ancoramento emotional films of the 80s. the film is iperspettacolare, more realistic, a worthy successor of the series. My vote is 8.5 For comments, consider deleting the drafting and voting to raise 8.5. For those suspected reviewers, but please, go to follow the matches of rugby which is better!

708,yourbigpalal83,"Dammed if you do, Dammed if you don't",8,23 May 2008,"This film is a prime example of the old saying ""Your dammed if you do, your dammed if you don't"". Im not going to go into lengthy story outline or performance, i felt everyone in the film did a great job, the story was fresh, the pacing was quick, before i knew it half the movie was over, but i guess that was because i was having a lot of fun, but its just one of those things that no matter what you do with a film like this, 20 years after the last one, your going to run into lovers and haters.There seems to be an argument saying its eather just like the old ones, or nothing like the old ones, and ya know, you just cant please everyone at once. If they did it just like the old films, then people would bitch and moan ""ive seen this already"", if you don't do it like the old ones, then people go ""its completely different"" with that said and done, this film feels like a nice balance between old and new. Old school stunts, good old Harrison is back in his flagship role, his old flame comes back, but its the new that people seem to hate. New writer, new sidekick, new villain, new mcguffin.Now, yes, they could have re introduced the ark, but then people would say, we already went on the quest to find the ark, cant we do something new? Well, they are complaining about the crystal skulls now, because its not the ark, or the grail, or the Sankara stones. Its like, OK, there is no pleasing some people.Another issue, is the films visual effects. Some are great, they look and feel like they belong, others feel out of place in an indy film. I know spielberg said not to much CGI, but, couldent he have dusted off the old optical printers and do every effect old school style. It is a legit concern. I mean, yes, it wouldent have looked as cool, but it would have felt at home more in an indy film. (which is supprising for me, since im the first guy on the net to come out and defend cgi most of the time) Overall i don't hate it like some people do. But then again, when your in a situation were its 20 years later, and you can only do so much, what do you expect. As an indy film, it fits, as a conclusion, no. I want more indy. So, on that aspect, the last crusade did work as a fitting conclusion, but now, we need a new conclusion.How ever, i would love to see the in between adventures of Indy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

710,pgwhite95,The George Lucas effect!,5,25 January 2009,"I am surprised at how this movie did so well in the box office. The fact that it is an additional film to the already, immensely popular Indiana Jones series, doesn't take away the fact that this film is appalling. I give Harrison Ford credit for coming back to the film, after all he is well into his years now, which is to say that he wasn't exactly young in the first place when he filmed the first three. Harrison Ford also, did his best with the story, and direction at hand because, it appears as if George Lucas has determined to destroy all of his masterpieces from the past. George Lucas has done to this story exactly what he did to his Star Wars saga, he made it so ""over the top"" un-believable, that he forgot why people liked the first three to begin with. The adventure was there, the story was a continuous mystery that kept the movie-goer hooked. This wasn't the case with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This must be what they call the George Lucas effect.The addition of Kate Blanchett, and Shia LaBeouf however, is actually what made this film somewhat bearable. Although, this was clearly one of Miss. Blancett's worst rolls, it is clear she was chosen for this roll based on her ability to act but, it fails her previous rolls. Shia LaBeouf seems to be a very versatile actor, and I would like to see him do more adventure-genre films.I recommend this film only to those who have some time to kill. If you are looking for the same magic, as in the previous three; sorry you won't find it here.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
711,steve-bailey-1,"More of the same, but that's not necessarily bad",8,18 May 2008,"(SPOILER ALERT: The movie's set-pieces are described in the next-to-last paragraph; otherwise, nothing major.) The fourth ""Indiana Jones"" movie is as much fun as you'd hope it would be. But when you think about the movie later, it holds up like one of those bridges that Indy and his gang manage to cross just before it collapses. So let's cover the flaws first.· ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""  Whew, that title is almost as long as the movie! What's more, since said kingdom isn't really the movie's main point, this might be the film to have its MacGuffin in the title.· Some of the more heralded actors come off as lightweight. As a Russian villainess, acclaimed Cate Blanchett seems to be working out her Natasha Fatale impression. And while Shia LaBeouf is likable enough, he proves it takes more than a pompadour, a cap, and a sneer to emulate Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One."" · Even my 11-year-old son noted that the movie's major set-piece is at least partially lifted from the recent ""National Treasure 2."" And the movie's climactic fireworks  like the similar ending of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""  practically show us the scriptwriter (""Jurassic Park's David Koepp) shrugging his shoulders once he reaches the end.All of that said, the movie rates as one of Indy's best adventures. The movie brings Indy (Harrison Ford, aging quite well) under the scrutiny of both the FBI and Russia's KGB when he inadvertently aids an old pal in the pursuit of the titular and powerful Crystal Skull. Despite his best effort to stick his neck out for no one, Indy gets caught up in the hunt for the famed orb.(Oh, and Indy's love interest from ""Raiders,"" Marion (Karen Allen}, makes a welcome return. But far be it from me to disclose how she gets woven into the plot.) The movie is set in 1957 and makes vague nods to that era's interests in McCarthyism, UFO's, and psychic power. But all the ""Happy Days"" blather is eventually ditched in favor of heart-pounding stunts, and in that department, the movie is well up to the level of its predecessors.The thrills include: an entire fake city that almost gets Indy nuked (the movie's least plausible set-piece); car chases and swordfights that seem homages to exec-producer George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" series; and the biggest bleepin' colony of killer ants you'll ever see.Like the famed dancing bear, the truth that a new Indy adventure is no longer novel, is less impressive than the fact that Ford, Lucas, and director Steven Spielberg pulled it off at all.

712,statistician_t,Huge disappointment,5,15 February 2009,"Well, like many people I also grew up with Indiana Jones. In our family, we really liked to watch the Indiana Jones adventures when they were shown on TV. They were great pieces of entertainment.With these high expectations I went to see The Crystal Skull. And disappointed I was. It began with the CGI hamster/marmot/prairie dog - you know something is fishy when you encounter fake animals in a 185 million dollar real-life movie. In the previous three films, Lucas and Spielberg were perfectly able to do without digital trickery.Then, what is this old guy... whatshisname... well, what was this demented professor doing? He didn't really contribute to the story, except for the fact that didn't go entirely insane before helping Indiana Jones.But really the biggest flaw in this movie was that Indy is a silly adventurer here, not a real hero. At every point in this movie he could have backed off from that adventure. He should have known from his previous adventures that his enemies invariably kill themselves in the end. In ""Crystal Skull"", Indy never was in a position where his or the life of anybody else was in immediate danger. It was only a race to get to the crystal skull ahead of the Soviets.Well, there were scary scenes like the hungry ants. But this was an accident, not a trap wantonly set up by the Soviet agents.

I grew up on those movies and just loved all of experiences I had surrounding those films.I was excited about this one because I thought, since it took them so long to finally agree on a script they liked, I knew it was going to be great.There was definitely great humor and some great action scenes, but overall, I have to admit that I was also somewhat disappointed. The acting felt forced and unnatural, and some of the action scenes were overdone. I felt like the ending was a total cop out. I mean, is that really the best ending/plot line they could've come up with? Overall, it really makes me sad because I love the Indiana Jones legend and I hate slamming the movie, but I don't think the movie did justice to the Indy legend overall.

715,AccessCardRequired,My five cents,9,21 May 2008,"Just came out of a preview in Berlin, Germany:What really made Indi big back in 1981, '84 and '89, was the kind of old school look and action. All the action was plausible, remember. Well, this is the weak part of Indi IV. (spoilers) At the end of the film, when the spaceship resurfaces', and a hurricane like storm destroys the ancient city, that's where the movie left me blank  why? It reminded me of the visual effects in Pirates of the Caribbean III, when both ships go under in a giant twist and twirl. That's way over the Top and for me doesn't fit in a Indi Jones Film. On the other hand, the story is cool. Plays with the Erich von Däniken Ideas, Mutt, the kid, who I thought was gonna be terrible is a real surprise. Second Best is Cate Blanchett. What a woman, what a great actress. Boy she makes that Russian Character really believable and scary. On top of all, Harrison. He looks and acts great. Why did the press and the producers made such a fuss about his age? A bit sad, that Mrs. Allen had a bit of a weak part.

716,inkslug,"Will be loved by the easily pleased who don't mind cliché upon cliché, poor plotting and script",3,22 May 2008,"Most people who watch this will have a warm place in their hearts for the original 3 films. I count myself as one of those people. As a result of this soft and fuzzy feeling many people will be blind to the multitude of faults in this film and not feel that the level of 'suspension of disbelief' required to enjoy it is several steps too far. Their critical compass will be switched off. For those people that's great, they're lucky, they'll love this film probably as much as the others, and do you know what? I'm jealous of them for that. This fourth instalment has all the same ingredients as the previous films:- a grumpy old Indy, a younger side-kick, nasty enemy soldiers, chases, action set pieces, and a big finale. It was also nice to see Karen Allen reprise her role, she was always my favourite female love interest.I watched this film as best as I could without already giving it a free pass because of what had gone before. I judged it on its merits and compared it to the numerous films of this type that have been made in the years since the last 'indy'. On that basis I was disappointed. In my view the acting and story was quite good, but the plotting was awful, as was the script, and there certainly wasn't as many laughs as should be expected in a film of this type. Movies have moved on since the original trilogy and I feel that it was stuck in a 'back in the day' mentality. The first hour consisted of every cliché and trope of the genre being clumsily thrown into the melting pot as if some child had written the plot and script and wanted to show off his pop culture knowledge. To be honest I was embarrassed for Spielberg.The repetitive clichés one piled on top of the other, the appallingly dodgy plotting in the warehouse, the popular icon imagery, the 'better dead than red' demos, the Roswell tie in all made it seem like someone was in a contest to write the worst ever episode of 'Dark Skies'. There were also so many inaccuracies and dumb impossibilities of the type that most modern action adventure films of today do their utmost to exorcise from their scripts. It was lazy and sloppy writing through and through. I also felt there was a character relationship deficiency, or at least that the chemistry was lacking, there wasn't enough fire between them. In the first movie there was Karen Allen. In the second Kate Capshaw and the boy, and in the third there was Sean Connery. Shia LaBeouf and Ray Winstone were responsible for those types of interactions here but I felt they were lacking. I know these types of movies aren't meant to have twists or surprises but surely you aren't also supposed to be able to surmise every scene, act and the finale within minutes of the movie starting.I strongly believe that if anyone watched this movie and Matthew Mcconaughey's 'Sahara' back to back it would be no contest as to which was more entertaining, funny, and action packed, as well as which had the best story, plot and script. It would be Sahara every time. I know I'm going to get negative feedback for this review but I'm just being honest and trying to review it with detachment and without my love of the previous movies creating a positive bias. It's a real shame. If only Spielberg had raised the bar in regards to story, plot and script to what we've come to expect in the 21st century this could have been an amazing film. In closing, having thoroughly slagged it off, I must add that the very final scene was quite spectacular from an 'FX eye candy' perspective.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

But never at any point reaches the same level as Indy's old adventures, which, honestly, is a shame.",6,6 September 2009,"Ever since the long-awaited fourth chapter in the Indiana Jones franchise was announced during early February there has been more media hype and build up than I could have imagined. However, I can assure you that the 20 year wait for this fourth episode in the daring archaeologist's life seems to be worth it.Until the films dazzling premiere and release, the plot had been very much under-wraps. Nevertheless, I can now say that the Nazis have finally been replaced by 1950 communist soviets, who are determined to acquire a range of paranormal weapons. They begin this campaign by searching for one of thirteen crystal skulls, which is said to have the power to brainwash civilisations. After some family catch-up and narrow escapes, Dr. Jones is eventually bought into this race for the weapon of 'the next generation.' In spite of this, the plot does in many parts become ridiculous and exaggeratedly stupid, swapping between incoherent themes and archaeological gibberish. You don't necessarily need an epic plot to make an epic movie, and this usually ends up destroying any films credibility.Thankfully, the implausible narrative is saved by the action. From the car chases to the sword fights, the action sequences are superbly shot and are a roller-coaster of a ride.

720,tristandetwiler,"(Insert Poster Quote Here) 'Cause this movie didn't have one, right?",4,21 December 2013,"... *SIGH* What in the f$@k went wrong? How'd we go from one of the best action films ever made to one of the most disappointing films ever produced? To fully understand that, I think we really need to delve down and analyze some of the basic aspects. I'm not going to go in extreme detail, I mean, if you want that, go watch RedLetterMedia. First, I'll lay down the facts and then give my opinion on the matter.The most obvious question is, why was this movie made? Simple: Money. I mean, that's why any movie is made, but here, just like the plot, the movie just feels forced. It's been over 21 years since the last movie for... well, a reason. Steven Spielberg never wanted to make this movie. What's hilarious is at the beginning of the ""Making of"" Documentary, Steven opens by saying there was a reason he put the Sunset shot at the end of The Last Crusade. Because it kind of brought the curtain down on the franchise; it was time for Lucas and Spielberg to mature on to make different movies. So for George to come back and randomly suggest to make another Indiana Jones film just shows how much of a terrible filmmaker he's become. The only to recognizable movies he's ever made were American Graffiti and Star Wars. That's it. What else do you know him for? Indiana Jones? No. Steven Spielberg directed those movies, not Lucas. Heck, George Lucas didn't even direct the 5th and 6th Star Wars films, so he can't really be credited for directing those.Okay, look, this whole review isn't here to bash George. It's just a good example of why this movie is very humiliating. It's funny to hear that the original titles for this movie were ""Attack of the Giant Ants"", ""and the Saucer Men"", and so on. What was this man thinking? Just to quickly note for those who didn't already know, George wanted the third Indiana Jones movie to be in a Haunted Castle... yeah. That's right. A Haunted house movie with Indiana Jones is probably one of the weirdest ideas ever. Why not having him search for other artifacts across the world? He could search for, possibly, a secret involving the Incas (Sound familiar?). The point is, he shouldn't be the one writing these movies. Spielberg has clearly shown he knows what he's doing with his other movies, whether he wrote them or not.Moving on, one major problem that a lot of people touch is: Is Harrison Ford too old to be Indiana Jones? My answer to this question is: ...Ehhw'weeelll'yyeah. Um, yes, he is. Harrison Ford was about 70 when he made this movie, which, come on, is not the right age for this kind of role. Indiana Jones was great as a young, adventurous, and likable hero. Sure, you have the actor here, but does that mean the character is still likable? To fix this problem, a friend and I bounced around ideas that Lucas should have used when throwing out the concept for this movie. An idea we both liked was having a new actor come in to play the adventurous man who's going to be the center of the movie. It would be perfectly fine if he was Indy's son, of course, and we suggested that Old Indiana Jones is only in the movie for a few short scenes. We could have the new actor come into a library where Indy is, have a short conversation, and that be it. The point of these movies is to have an adventure. If you ever watched any of those classic adventure films in the early days of cinema, then tell me, when you watched those movies, sure, you saw different actors, but you saw or envisioned the same character, right? It doesn't matter in this kind of movie who plays the hero; just who does it and if they do it right.This was not done right, but holy damn, I hadn't even talked about the plot yet. Y'Well, I ain't going to. All I can say is the entire plot is explored and explained in the first ten minutes. That's what makes the movie so boring. There were a lot of scenes I forget about until I watched the film again to remind myself. Most of them pointless scenes that just gave some of the characters stuff to do (Which is never good in any kind of movie). There a lots of comical effects that made people, me especially, roll my eyes. A lot of the grit from the other films is missing in this movie, meaning there's no heavy violence present in the movie. It lacks the excitement and thrills the other movies had, partially due to the cheap Video Game Visuals and the predictable scene set-ups. It's pathetic. I've seen B-Movies made better than this crappy garbage. ...Which perfectly sums up this movie, Why was the concept picked and why was this movie made? I want a bigger reason than money... my guess is that George Lucas has no more Original ideas and just wants to keep making money off ideas he helped make about 30 years ago. Did you know he directed no movies between Star Wars and Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace? Yeah, that was it... Ugh, I just won't understand him. I won't.Let's just hope the 5th one won't be as bad... I doubt it...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
721,caroledelm,Nu-cu-ler?,8,8 June 2008,"This is an enjoyable & entertaining movie, with a good cast. I was at first disappointed when Harrison Ford pronounced nuclear as ""nuculer"". I later reconsidered & thought that maybe it was a joke on the part of Spielberg, one of my all-time favorite directors or someone else involved with the film. However, on reading ALL the goofs in this production, I wonder if it wasn't more sloppiness or lack of attention to detail? My husband & I have seen the previous Indiana Jones films & liked them enough that we looked forward to this one. Crystal Skull was recommended to us, & we would certainly recommend it to other people. But, having seen the two National Treasure movies, one very recently,I think I've had enough of this theme for a while.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
722,Trashbag,"Not a masterpiece, but still satisfying",7,25 May 2008,"The cast does a remarkable job overall. Harrison Ford still has the physical strength to pull this role off and he does so very gracefully. Shia LaBeouf is Shia LaBeouf; he acts out his role the same as all of his other roles. That's not really a bad thing, but he needs to expand his acting range a bit. Cate Blanchett did alright; this wasn't one of her best roles, but she does a convincing villain. It's also nice to see Karen Allen back as Marion, although her character doesn't really serve much purpose to the entire plot in general.Speaking of the plot, I don't even know what to say. The whole thing just seems so over-the-top and ridiculous. There were many, many moments that had me wondering what the filmmakers were thinking. It was as if they tried to cram in as much as they could and it left me with a feeling of ""What the hell did I just watch?"" The script itself is a little on the cheesy side; at times , it was effective, but other times, it was trying too hard. I can definitely say, however, that it kept me interested throughout. Mostly because I was trying to figure out just what was going on, but still.Technically, this movie was put together well. Although there was a bit too much CGI for my taste, the special effects work. John William's score is great as always, even though almost all of it was a rehash of the previous movies.There was really no way this movie could've lived up to our expectations, but how could it? It's purpose was to deliver another thrilling adventure, and it did. It wasn't trying to better Raiders or anything, since that's basically impossible. Overall, it's not as good as Raiders or Last Crusade, but I think it was slightly better than Temple of Doom. It's a fun movie and it ends the series with a bang (if this is indeed the last one).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
723,briandoodo,"Not as good as I remembered, time reveals it's problems",6,17 June 2017,"So, I waited about 10 years to see this movie. I was so excited for it. Every day, I obsessed over it. I was always looking to other roles HF was doing prior to the film, fantasizing he put the hat back on. I'd always tell myself that he wasn't too old to wear that fedora one last time. At the time I saw it, I was shocked, I didn't know how to react, the film was so over the top, took such a strong break from reality. TOD had it's over the top moments, but KOTCS just took things to an atomic level. I was in denial. I had such mixed feelings, for years I was confused how to feel about the movie. I've gone back to rate it. The film starts off with cringe worthy, terrible dialogue. From the very beginning of this film it suffers from horrific dialogue that the actors and actresses are clearly struggling to deliver. There's a few action sequences that are honestly probably the best of the franchise. The fight scenes that take place in the rocket base, the car chase through the university. These were all great scenes. There's a few scenes in this that were actually quite good. But the movie is weighed down by the God awful dialogue, the awkward acting, the lack of chemistry between cast members. The dialogue is just terrible, unforgivable. George Lucas should not write dialogue EVER. The film has just too many stupid over the top moments that just drag it down.The movie is just too awkward to enjoy, the actors, actresses clearly are uncomfortable with the dialogue that was wrote for them, and the whole movie start to finish is basically cringe worthy for that.It's too bad, because some of this film was very good, and HF was in top form, and the action scenes were very enjoyable. Unfortunately the movie had just a little too much stupid in it, and didn't possess enough realism to be taken seriously. The acting was awkward, forced...the dialogue was terrible, and there was just too much stupid.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
724,chunkmeal2,No worse than any of the first three!,7,18 October 2013,"I just watched all four in the series (over the course of a month). I thought the first was pretty mediocre, but could see why it would have been awesome in 1981.The next three were the exact same thing, over and over again. The only reason why ""Indy 4"" got such bad reviews is because it's no longer 1981. What was once fresh and awesome is now stale and cheesy.Format: Movie begins with Indiana Jones embroiled in some tricky situation, at some random exotic location. He gets out of it unscathed, of course. Bullets fly everywhere but none will ever touch him.We then move on to the main story. Indiana Jones for some reason needs to recover some artefact which we know will turn out to be somehow magical. Lots of villains (Nazis, Indians, Nazis, Soviets) also want the artefact. They keep trying to kill Indiana Jones. They keep capturing him, but every time they capture him, they have some reason (or not) to keep him alive. They keep him guarded by one or zero guys so he can escape. He escapes. While dodging as usual several thousand bullets. The villains are all incompetent klutzes who consistently get whooped, even if it's 5-on-1 and they are all armed and Indy just has his bare fists. They often like to stand around and laugh evilly for no apparent reason. (In this regard, Indy 4 was slightly better, as Cate Blanchett was a little less incompetent than the usual Indiana Jones villain. Though most of her Soviet soldiers were still comically retarded.)There is some good looking chick for Indy to screw in each movie. Except for Indy 4 of course, because it's gross to even hint that a 65 year old is capable of intercourse.We get to the end where the artefact is recovered. The bad guys always happen to be there as well, often prodding Indiana to get it for them. But of course the bad guys don't fully appreciate the power of the artefact, and so they all get annihilated by the magic of the artefact, while Indiana and friends get out nice and safe. You know, just in case there is another sequel and a few hundred more million to be made.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
725,Habus,I wonder why they wanted to film this one.,3,28 September 2009,"This is bad. This is really bad. I never wanted to see this one, but it just popped up during a night channel switching on HBO. Now I know I shouldn't have stayed on that channel. If I should compare the Crystal Skull to the other other Indy movies, it would receive 1/10 and that 1 would be for Harrison Ford being Indy. I rate this movie as a stand alone flick. It's still entertaining, but in the modern way, where you have to turn your brain off. Totally. I mean, Indy survives the nuclear bomb test in the fridge, action scenes seems to be taken out of some lame computer game, Indy and the gang survives three Niagara falls look-alike in one sitting and so on. Plot? Yeah, there is some kind of a plot to fill the high tense action scenes. And everything is fast fast fast, like all those new flicks. In a way, before I saw it, I wanted to believe they did this movie for a nostalgia, so the focus would be set on the film, not on the dumb audience. It wasn't.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
726,moonz1972,All the elements we love,8,26 August 2018,I can't grasp why all the low reviews for this movie. It's an venture movie so it supposed to be far fetched and if you analyse the plot of essentially a popcorn movie your gonna find plot holes. This was another entry in the Indiana Jones saga and I kinda knew what to expect and was thoroughly entertained throughout the film. We've grown older and so has Indy so it was good to see Harrison Form reprise the iconic role. well worth a couple of hours of your time.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
727,wiholke2020,This is not Indiana Jones!,5,3 April 2015,"A PG-13 movie. Watch with someone older than 13 at all times! Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull! Let's start where it all began for me. I'm like 4 years old, and my Dad shows me the first three. Then my brothers and I see the the trailer for this one. We were all excited to watch it. But my Dad has a rule that we can't watch PG-13 movies until we were 13. So I had to wait. Five years later I forgot this movie even existed until my family was watching it on TV one afternoon. I got to see the part where the alien forms and kills the person. I also got to see the UFO. Yes, what I just said was exactly true. Sorry to disappoint you.I was disappointed too. I didn't want to see aliens, I want to see Indy taking over cars an epic fight scenes and Indy swinging from his whip and falling in love with another girl because he's just that cool! Instead I got a boat car and a fight scene not with the bad guy getting chopped up in a propeller, not getting caught in a stone grinder, and not falling off a cliff while hanging on to a tank, but the bad guy getting eaten buy big (beep) ants! I also got old Marion. Just keep her in Raiders, thank you very much! Now back to the tragic back story. 4 years after that, I realized I had none of the Indiana Jones movies on Blu-ray or DVD! So I went birthday shopping and came across Raiders of the Lost Ark on DVD, and the whole Indy collection (including this one) on Blu-ray. I couldn't get both, so I had to choose one. The Indy collection it is.So that month I had a classic Indiana Jones marathon. Then, I looked at the crystal skull. I started to think, don't judge a book by its cover. So I faced the truth. It's time to watch it.You know how the Paramount mountain always turns into a real mountain in Indiana Jones? Well, for this one, the mountain turned into a molehill. Which in the land of idioms and metaphors isn't supposed to be possible, but I guess in Indiana Jones land it is. Then we start hearing Elvis Presley singing ""ain't nothing but a hound dog,"" then I wondered if I put the right movie in. Well, I guess I did because right after that it says, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" so, yes. It is the right movie! Then we have the car playing Elvis driving by a bunch of army vehicles wanting a drive race. Is this really an Indiana Jones movie? Because if we took the credits out and showed it to a person who never saw this movie, they would not guess it would be part of an Indiana Jones film.If they took out the groundhog hill and put in an actual mountain, took out the car with Presley singing and just had the army vehicles driving to the warehouse with some mysterious music in the background, that would be a great first scene.Then, so far so good, we see Indy for the first time in 20 years, then we have the stupid lady try to read Indy's mind and says, ""You're hard to read, Dr. Jones!"" I said, ""OK, you're losing me Indiana Jones!"" And for the rest of the movie, that's exactly what it did to me! Things I dislike. The alien box. The rocket launcher. The stupid groundhogs that appear in every scene. The nuke town village thing. In the house, the fake people are watching Howdy Doody. Howdy Doody! Indy doesn't die from the Nuke. No one can survive that. Indy gets fired. His Dad and Marcus are dead. Mutt. The bar fight scene. What is this, the Outsiders? Oxley. Marion. What the heck? They dissected Martians? I'm D-O-N-E, done. The skull has the powers to destroy peoples minds. We get to see the Russians do just that to Indy, to! Mutt's Indy's son. Mutt can apparently sword fight and catch up to speeding vehicles by swinging on vines. The monkeys. The ants. The boat car. The waterfalls. The alien. The UFO. Indy and Marion get married. How many was that? Oh! 23. Twenty three! What do I like? Not much. I do like some of the action. I do like the classic Indy they put in here at times, but not all the movie obviously or else I wouldn't have made that long list of things I hate. The soundtrack is good, like always, but not as good as the original Indiana Jones' soundtracks.I know a few people who haven't seen the original Indiana Jones but have seen this one and loved this one. So, I thought to myself. This movie would be awesome if you haven't seen the originals. So this movie is not Indiana Jones. There's the classics, and this one. You can't put the two together, that would be chaos.So overall, I did not like this movie as much as I wanted to when I was 4. So when my kids ask me one day how many Indiana Jones movies there are, I will say, ""Only 3!"" 5 stars!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
728,dishjones,Some ultra cheesy parts ruin a decent sequel,7,23 August 2020,"I re-watched this recently. It's a actually pretty good up until about half way through. The opening scene is quite fantastic short of some really cliche BS and crappy dialogue. I also really like the Mcguffin in this case and exploring the whole 1950s vibe and UFO conspiracy. I also really loved the slow burn of Indy picking up the clues of where Oxley left off (even though this plot device has been used in Raiders and Last Crusade). The ending is decent. I really loved the whole entry into the ancient city. The set production was fantastic. Bringing Marian back and having Mutt as his son was stupid a so poorly executed. Also, much of the dialogue and even just the delivery is awful and surprising it even made the final cut. It's just campy and ridiculous. They go far too out of their way to point out that Indy is old. Yeah we get it after like the fifth reference. I didn't even have a problem with the Nuke scene. Actually kinda loved it. But from Marian being introduced to the ridiculous jungle chase/sword fight/Mutt swinging through the trees like Tarzan? That part was just embarrassing. So unbelievably stupid. Also, Cate Blanchett is a great actress but her whole character and the replacement of the Russians as the Nazi's, while necessary didn't ever distinguish themselves as unique baddies. Just stick in place bad guys. Blanchett's character is so over the top and cliche it made my skin crawl. She seems more comical than threatening in anyway. Plus, Ray Winstones character is so absolutely unnecessary and annoying. Lastly, I know that it's hard for these studios and directors to recreate the magic of nostolgia from movies made 20 years prior. But they need to realize that audiences do get smarter as filmmaking evolves. Like how many punch sound effects do we really need to hear over a over again?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
729,martinkosecky,The weakest Indiana Jones movie,5,5 August 2020,"A bad CGI laden stupidity with not very compelling plot or characters. It still had some qualities like okay humour, but it just felt underwhelming",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
730,errol1909,19 Years in the making and this is what we get...WHAT A WASTE,1,29 May 2008,"My expectations going into this movie were very low after reading so many harsh reviews that I had thought were total BS. Was this film really that bad? Well, after seeing it last Saturday, most of the reviews on this film were right. This is film is downright awful. It makes Temple of Doom (TOD) look like a great and realistic film. That's saying an awful lot! The film was conceived by Liberal Liar Spielberg (LLS) and I-like-to-pull-scripts-out-of-my a*s George Lucas (GL). The film is full of political BS: The Red Scare and The Cold War. All exaggerated by LLS. The 1950's were a great time to be alive. A fun and swinging decade. Sadly this film is anything but fun or exciting.The first 40 minutes of the film I rather enjoyed. The race of the teen's vs Russians introduced the story to a 1950's setting. The first shot of Indy and the warehouse searching for the mummified remains of the alien was also interesting. It gave the whole thing a mysterious feeling. I think it would have been wiser to keep the alien mythology a mystery throughout the film and never reveal anything. The poor action is what dragged this thing down and down.The recreation of the neighborhood done 1950's like for or A-Bomb testing was neat. The set was done so accurately and had a 50's feel to it right down to the interior design to props decorated all around it. Seeing Indy walk around the set was weird, but at the same time gave the audience a glimpse that Indy isn't in the 1930's anymore. However, Indy surviving the nuclear explosion while hidden in a refrigerator was a YOU-GOT-TO-BE-KIDDING moment. Now I knew this wasn't Indy anymore but James Bond and a scene pulled right out of GL's a*s. I didn't think another scene in the movie would top that awful scene, but it didmany of them.All the archeology junk of scavenging temples and places that are very, old was exciting as hell in the 3 real Indy films. In this film they are nothing more than tired clichés taken right out of the The Mummy and National Treasure films. The beauty of the 3 real Indy films is when Indy is exploring the Well of the Souls, or the Temple of Doom or the catacombs underneath the library, the audience along with Indy was in for an incredible adventure of discovery and wondering just like him if he going to get out alive. That was Indiana Jones! The whole alien crap and the temple exploring in Indy 4 was boring and wasn't the least bit thrilling. It would have been better if they made this whole alien concept as scary as hell. No can't GL would probably wet his pants.As for the action, I'll keep it short. SUCKS BADLY. LLS with the help of some great Assistant Directors did a fantastic job in the 3 real Indy films shooting fun and exciting action sequences. In this film it's obvious that LLS shot the scenes himself. LLS statement prior to the movie's release that there would be ""little CGI"" was a flat-out lie. Spielberg couldn't even direct an action scene all by himself that is great even if he took the Michael Curtiz school of Action Directing. Action is the biggest strength of the 3 real Indy films. Here there nothing more than scenes to wear out the viewer and to fill in running time.Another (YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING moment) is when Indy and company dive off 3 very enormous waterfalls and come out without a scratch. Hey, Indy already survived a nuclear explosion, what's a little water and current going to do to him? NOTHING! The guy is no longer Indy, but Bond... James Bond. That scene had LLS BS written all over it.The downright shi*ty climax has GL turd scattered all about. The climax is definitely pulled straight of Lucas a*s. It's the Howard the Duck of climaxes where Indy and Co are in yet another lifeless temple search right out of The Mummy films looking for the who-gives-a-damn secret passage to find the final resting place for the alien skull and come face to face with a dozen other crystal heads. Once the head is placed the whole damn thing comes alive, the temple falls apart, and the alien figures come together to form an ALIEN a real one and then a SPACESHIP flies off into the sky and disappears. The whole thing screams The X-Files and even takes the whole spaceship thing right out of the climax of The X-Files film.To sum it all up, I knew this film was going to be a mess especially after 19 years in the making. However, I didn't know it was going to be sequels to The Mummy and National Treasure. There is no Indiana Jones feel or fun in this film. It's like George Lucas saw these other Indy rejects and thought I can make this but let's have it star Harrison Ford, call it Indiana Jones 4 and have aliens in it and other far-out garbage. Yeah, I'll show them I can make it better. Truly, a bad end to an otherwise great trilogy now forever diminished by a film that never should have been made.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
731,jmbellin,Mishmash of Previously Used Ingredients Creates Mediocre Installment,5,26 May 2008,"I'm sorry to say that while this latest installment had its moments, it was disappointingly quite weak. Many ingredients from previous installments seemed to have been slapped together into this film, arising from nothing other than than the thought that, individually, each ingredient worked in the past, so let's put them all together now. It's like you were creating a dish from an amalgam of past experiences, so putting all of the ingredients that you loved so much in all your past meals into one dish will be even better! Let's hear it for that wonderful chocolate peanut butter dessert taste combined in one dish with the strawberry shortcake, creme brulee, blueberry-pineapple sorbet, grand marnier souflee, and cherries flambe. All of those desserts seemed so good individually, they should be wonderful all thrown together to make one dessert.Harrison Ford seems a bit old and tired, not quite up for the adventure. Karen Allen seems a bit lost as if the filmmaker and writer(s) didn't quite know what to do with her. The character's appearance is useless and seems contrived, compared to the feisty character in the first film who was an equal to Indiana Jones and could easily survive on her own.There are too many elements in this film, very few arise organically. Again, they seem to be thrown together because the elements somehow worked in the past, but the filmmaker ignored how to create a strong narrative drive and have the elements arise out of the need to tell the story.Too much of the film has Ford explaining why we should care about various clues he finds. All that talking is going to make it go above the head of young Indiana Jones fans, while make us not care because, again, the plot is too contrived.Yes, the first film came out of left field and the story and elements were perfectly created. At this point, however, I think they should put this series to bed. And if the reason that this film was created was to continue the franchise with Shia LaBeouf, there's not going to be much of a following as he seems as lost in this as the rest of the cast.There were a few exciting sequences and Indiana's toughness and wit shone most successfully in the opening sequence, but the film just could not really keep up. There were several self-spoofing references, but on top of the relative tiredness of the film, it made me think that the filmmaker was less than inspired.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
732,john-quel,"Putin won't like it, but you probably will",8,26 May 2008,"I am going to try, but it is difficult to add anything to what has already been written about the film. Critical commentary has been all over the map and while the overall consensus is positive there have been strong dissents and an overall feeling that something is missing. In terms of sheer action and pace the movie certainly works. One critic complained that she found it boring and came close to falling asleep. If so, having a history of sleep problems myself, I must say I envy her. The film is so frenetic, so non-stop in it's rush to achieve whatever the goal is that it is after, that my eyes were never off the screen, even when I wished at times they were. Certainly the first hour of the film is the best. The lead-up to the quest is very well done and some of the imagery -- you will know it when you see it -- is startling, mind-bending in one instance. The introduction of the characters is well-done and the overall context -- a very intense cold-war conflict being played out in America is credible given the times. Moreover, the use of Russians (""Soviets"" be precise) as the bad guys, very bad guys, is wonderfully refreshing -- I am so tired of movie Nazis monopolizing cinematic evil. And just to see Harrison Ford in full Indy get-up is a joy beyond words.Let's start with the characters. Indy is old. The film makers make absolutely no bones about it, almost rubbing it in. His punches seem slower probably because they really are. Like Rocky, however, he can absorb tremendous punishment and just keeps coming at you no matter how many times you punch him down. Shia leBeouf is quite good and for all those who worried he was going to be the human Jar Jar Binx of the picture, can relax. He does just fine. And Karen Allen, in contrast to Indy, is ageless. And unlike Ford's mostly dour performance, her's is best described as giddy. She is obviously so delighted to be back in an Indy film that it comes across probably too well. And Cate Blanchett does a great villain, utterly convincing.Technically the film is a marvel. The depiction of the 50's is so well-done that you half expect Marty McFly to show up. Everything works, which is why I give the first half four stars. But after the first half, Crystal Skull is pretty much one over the top action sequence after another. If you like that kind of thing (and mostly I do), this is the kind of thing you will like. The problem is that you start to see the influences and they creak even worse than Indy: George has once again raided ideas from his stack of Uncle Scrooge comics and this time I really felt the late, great Carl Barks was robbed. Everything from the ants (nasty, hideous, horrifyingly gross ants) to the jungle clearing Paul Bunyon machine come from those comics. If you think of the Russians/Soviets in the second half of the film as crazed Beagle Boys led by Magica de Spel, you know all you have to know.All that is forgivable, however. What I think what was really missing was a McGuffin that we cared about, which in the best Indy pictures has been something possessing a culturally religious connection. The substitute, the ""Crystal Skull"" is just not that interesting. Lucas is on record stating he felt bad about using the Ark of the Covenant in the classic, never to be equaled first film, because it had upset and offended people (we live in time when the act of breathing upsets and offends some people), and did not want to do that again. Both the Ark and the Grail are objects that are direct links (""Radio transmitter,"" was the phrase used in the first movie) to God. Whether you believe that or not, these artifacts are a core part of our culture, and the quest for these sacred objects has tremendously dramatic potential. You know at once why people would go crazy to find and possess them. Which is why the first and third Indy films worked so much better than the second (remember the magic rocks?).So while I liked the film, this is why I give the second half of the movie two stars. The fourth and the second have to be marked up as mostly fun failures.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This is still a fun movie!,7,26 May 2008,"Reading all the comments here, it looks like this is one of the worst films ever made, and it's absolute rubbish, Shia's character is Jar Jar Binks, etc.But it's earning a ton of money, and the rankings (7.6) are high, so what does that tell you? That compared to the haters, MOST people came to his movie expecting a fun adventure movie and got it.Look, the Indiana Jones movies aren't flawless. Even in the previous movies, you had to suspend belief (people melting? someone surviving a fall from a plane just on a craft? a Knight living more than 1,000 years?) and just enjoy the action scenes - and you have them here! Mutt swinging on the vines is real corny but the car chase through the jungle, complete with sword fight, fisticuffs, giant ants, etc. - they are what you can expect from an Indiana Jones movie. And Cate Blanchett is a SUPER villain, Harrison somehow makes it all believable for him to still be an action star at 60 plus, and it's great to see Marion Ravenwood again.STAR WARS I was a major major disappointment, but this one is NOT. We have wanted to see Harrison Ford suit up as Indy again, and here he has a good cast with him, and yet we bash the movie because it isn't RAIDERS?

735,lvscott,"Not as bad as some are saying here, and I will explain why..",7,23 May 2008,"I believe the reason a few people are saying this film is really bad is because allot of people want that ""film Magic"" of the first film in this series, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". What people fail to realize is that at the time, that film was one of a kind for the time, a new roller coaster ride for many of us when we were younger.No film will ever quite match it, including any film with the main character of ""Indiana Jones"".. Having said that, this film here is fun enough on it's own merits. Of course, it is not a great film, but it is entertaining..My criticisms;I could of done without what I consider to be ""Alien Propaganda"" that seems to plaugue allot of Spielbergs directed films.The new characters could of been fleshed out more.Spielberg should of kept his word, and used allot less CGI, he didn't. In fact, everything he has represented about this film before it's release has frankly been flat out FALSE!! The story could of been better, but it is not bad.My likes; Harrison Ford still has it, He looks Great, and got back into the character of Indiana Jones quite well.The pacing was good and about the same as Raiders in that regard.Nice to see Karen Allen again on the screen. I always liked her as an actress.final verdict.Worth a viewing, but DO NOT EXPECT the same magic that Raiders had, or you will end up like many here, HATING IT!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

737,cortlahman,"Cheap, childish and cheesy",2,20 September 2009,"Only a select few of bad movies have been the focus of a subplot in an entire episode of South Park. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was unlucky enough to be one of them. Oh and boy did Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a good job making fun of it. ""Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator, Stan? It didn't make any sense, Stan."" There are innumerable moments in this movie where you can't help but yell ""There's no way they could survive that!"" I also found myself cringing at the god awful CG things jumping about. With some of the scenes that made it into TKOTCS, I am surprised that Spielberg and Lucas didn't give the go ahead to include one with Jar Jar Binks saving the day.Aliens? Really? You could literally solve every kind of mystery featured in every single movie by putting aliens behind it. How could such a giant shark come to be in the movie Jaws? Well, he was genetically altered by aliens. Where did the scientists in Jurassic Park come up with the idea on how to clone dinosaurs? Aliens gave them a scholarship to study at their intergalactic university. Why was Amon Goeth in Schindler's List so evil? He was an alien.Of the four Indiana Jones movies this one continues the saga with its sort of pass/fail pattern. Raiders of the Lost Ark, pass. The Temple of Doom, fail. The Last Crusade, pass.

I figured it would not meet my expectations (especially after seeing what uncle George did with the Star Wars prequels). It was worse. No Nazi's, but the Russian Villain was quite good. I liked Harrison Ford as an older Indy. And that was the good part. It is a movie, so it does not have to be uber-real. But surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge?!?!?!? Too much. And it gets worse from there. All scenes you have seen in the Mummy movies, National Treasure and X-files (the ending is a copy of Mymmy Returns with the X-files UFO take off from the first X movie). The scarabs from Mummy have been replaced by ants. The puzzles Indy has to solve are too easy! Useless scenes. Just after the nuclear blast where he gets the scrubbing... and with the snake pit. It was a slapstick moment just for laughs, but slows the movie down. The Inca chase could have been fun, but the mess that up by solving it too easy.In short, I was sad. Especially when I found out that the music was mostly a copy from the previous movies (John Williams is FANTASTIC, so this does not have to be a bad thing) but it has not been recorded with the LSO at Abbey Road.

739,worldriot,In a word : Tripe,3,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones is back, and so is George Lucas' penchant for ruining perfectly good stories with over the top effects.A solid foundation is present for a good story here, and Spielberg promptly crashes it into the ground. Adorable groundhogs and monkeys don't make us coo, guys, it makes us furrow our brows and yawn.Not only is the South American Native culture raped and pillaged throughout this film, but unfortunately so is the Jones franchise. Ridiculous stunts such as Mutt swinging on vines ala Tarzan (and keeping up with speeding Jeeps no less) weigh down the story so much it becomes almost unbearable to watch. I spent too much time groaning ""God, give me a break"" to be able to actually get into the story.Highlights to the film include some incredible scenery, Harrison Ford manages to surprise everyone with his stunts and the fact that Spielberg and co. had the stones to make this film to begin with, but unfortunately those highlights cannot offset the weight of the negatives in this film.For some reason Lucas missed a very important lesson he should have learned recently, which is : If you're not going to actually improve a franchise, let it die with dignity.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
740,lescamer,One of the best of the Indiana Jones adventures,7,23 May 2008,"I am no fan of Spielberg, but I must say that I am really impressed by the way he managed to continue the series so well after nineteen years. I'd say it's better than Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Not only is this in keeping with the rest of the series, but it is made much better. The characters are complex, so are the relationships, and the photography is much better. All the bad things in the film (the anti- Communism, the corny lines, etc.) are pardoned because one can attribute them to the fact that it is Indiana Jones. With the exception of the ending, which is unforgivable. The character of Indiana Jones is very well done here. He till has the same physical health and everything that makes Indiana Jones Indiana Jones, but age has changed him subtly. However, the best acting comes from Shia LaBeouf and Ray Winstone. They have somewhat conflicted roles- LaBeouf's character tries to act tough to disguise his true wimpy nature, Winstone's constantly hesitates between his friendship with Jones and his desire for fortune.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

742,Flower_of_the_Lily,It's an Indiana Jones film. Thank God for that ...,9,23 May 2008,"I can't recall the last time I saw Harrison Ford on the big screen. Well, actually I can - it was in ""What Lies Beneath"". Not a bad horror film as it goes, but surely far below the stratospheric heights he scaled in the late 70's/early 80's. But since then - eight years ago - I can't recall seeing him in anything. And that's mystifying when you recollect he was once one of the biggest movie stars (and possibly the coolest man on Earth) in Hollywood a while back. He ceased being a star and became a jobbing actor in various passable roles that didn't give us so much as a glimpse of the charming rogue who could take on armies single-handed.Well, Ford fans rejoice: Harrison the star has returned. There's a long build-up to the first shot of his face, but it's worth it. There's a glint in his eye, a smirk on his face and the fedora is a perfect fit. His Indiana Jones is back, and he's as smart and adventurous as ever. The film wastes no time throwing our hero into the thick of the action, and he does it with aplomb. Forget the naysayers who say he's past it - Indy doesn't look 65, and he sure as hell doesn't move like he's 65. Am I gushing too much about this? It's just so fantastic to see one of the greatest cinematic heroes ever return and basically rule the world with a crack of his whip.The film opens in full-blown action style, with Indy and old war friend ""Mac"" (Ray Winstone) being kidnapped by a bunch of Russian spies, including the devilish Colonel Spalko (Cate Blanchett) who apparently has psychic talents (which happily don't work on Indy). The Russians force Indy to locate a certain artifact for them in a military warehouse (not THAT artifact, although we do catch a glimpse of it) until Indy effects an amazing escape (just wait for a certain scene involving a fridge ...) However, when we leave the Russians behind, it becomes clear that despite the fact Indy still wears the fedora and still kicks bad-guy ass all over the place, things have drastically altered since we saw him ride off into the sunset in ""Crusade"". Henry Jones Sr and Marcus Brody have both shuffled off their mortal coils, and the traitorous actions of Mac means that both Indy's job and that of his dean and friend Charles Stanforth (a sadly underused Jim Broadbent) fall victim to the anti-communist witch hunters of the FBI. He's just about ready to pack it all in and head for Europe when he gets sidetracked by a motorcycle-riding, knife-wielding, smart-alec young man named Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf). Both Mutt's mother and his dear friend Professor Oxley have been kidnapped in Peru whilst searching for a mythical crystal skull, and the only clues Mutt has to go on are a letter and some strange symbols. So he's done what his mother advised him to and sought out Indy for help ...And from that moment the action just refuses to stop. They're chased by baddies, shot at, engage in fistfights, sword-fights, car chases, drive off cliffs, go over waterfalls, get stuck in dry sand traps, get menaced by insects and there's even a fun Tarzan-inspired swing through the treetops. Towards the end you'll probably be drained and wishing there was a moment to pause and reflect on the adventure. Even the romantic sub-plot (featuring the best heroine the franchise has produced, Marion Ravenwood) hurtles along with wisecracks and arguments left, right and centre. But that's what this film is about - it's Ford and Spielberg doing what they do best, and doing it better than anyone else ever could.Ford as aforementioned is fantastic. Blanchett is the best baddie the Bond franchise never had, Karen Allen as Marion is strong, clever, and immensely enjoyable and Winstone vacillates between good and sneaky very convincingly, although the script leaves him looking rather two-dimensional. Even LeBeouf's character comes out looking good: he's a very likable presence on screen, just as smart and capable as Indy, but wisely the filmmakers have made no attempt to turn him into the next Indiana Jones (although they flirt with the idea at the end of the film). Mutt follows Indy and backs him up, but no one could ever take Indy's place and so the film doesn't try to force him to. I think it's safe to assume that Mutt takes up the fedora and has adventures out in movieland, but if Spielberg has any affection at all for Indy, as I'm sure he does, we're not going to see them.It's no ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", which is perhaps the most perfect adventure film ever made (although there's a moment involving Indy's fear of snakes that comes pretty damn close to that standard in my humble opinion) but it's fun, thrilling, funny, imaginative - and it's an Indiana Jones film. Okay, I wish they'd found a different resolution at the end (inter-dimensional beings? No, not quite working for me - an old Peruvian god, akin to Temple of Doom would have been better) But it's an Indiana Jones film. Not a film that just so happens to feature a character called Indiana Jones who vaguely resembles the hero of the 80's, but one featuring THE Indiana Jones and an adventure worthy of him. Eat your imitation hearts out, ""National Treasure"" and ""Sahara"", Indy rules and forever will.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
743,jmcleod_5,Indiana Jones. Still my favourite film character,10,24 May 2008,"The backlash against this film was so predictable. It's almost exactly the same as when Phantom Menace came out. Too many people take these things seriously and it's hard to believe many of the people writing harsh criticisms have any affection for movies at all.Crystal Skull had it's flaws but then so did the other three. Raiders of the Lost Ark still remains my favourite film but it had flaws. This is only natural. Films are an organic medium with hundreds of people having their input. It only stands to reason that some mistakes slip through. Temple of Doom received a lot of flak but I thought it was great. I thought it was brave to take the tone in a different direction and as far as I am concerned I thought it worked perfectly. Last Crusade tried too hard to capture the magic of Raiders but was redeemed by the pairing of 007 and Indiana Jones. Also crusade had some of the worst special effects in any Lucas/Spielberg production. However this did not at all subvert me from enjoying what it was supposed to be. Two hours of sheer escapism.As for Crystal Skull the minor carps I have don't dampen the overall effect of the film. Everyone thinks Cate Blanchett was great as the Russian villain but to me she was just channeling any number of Russian villains from a Bond film of your choice. And she did the worst acting job of the film. She just seemed out of place. The fridge sequence, the vine swinging and the boat going over the waterfalls were way over the top but they made you laugh more than cringe.The strengths of this film far outweigh the bad. Harrison Ford was on top form as his greatest creation. It makes up for a lot of his dire roles over the last decade. He'll always be my favourite actor based on his excellent portrayals of classic movie characters. Shia LeBouf was way better than his buffoonish teenager in Transformers. He'll never be Indiana though so there's no point going there. Most of the actors did fine jobs and I don't have a problem with them.A lot of people have complained about the excessive CGI elements but you have to go with the times. This type of film couldn't be made today with the old technology. It wouldn't work and most of the naysayers here would be bemoaning the use of old technology and accusing Spielberg and Lucas for living in the past.The best thing about this film is the fact that it harks back to the original trilogy with it's look and pace yet you come out of the theatre feeling that it was a completely new Indiana Jones experience and it felt fresh and new.I think people should stop bashing Lucas. The man revolutionised cinema and because of him you wouldn't have the film-making technologies today that bring you your arty farty independents. Without big Hollywood blockbusters courtesy of the likes of Spielberg and Lucas there would be no independent cinema because they wouldn't get the interest or exposure.It boils down to the fact that if you think Lucas is so rubbish pick up a pen and paper, get some money and a camera and go out and improve on his so-called failures. Get out from behind your keyboard and put your money where your mouth is.As for Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford, thanks for bringing me a film that I can walk out of the theatre smiling and take me back to a time when it was fun to go to the movies.Well done and keep it up.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
744,rchosen,The WEAKEST Indy movie (well the only weak one).,4,24 May 2008,"Spoilers aren't posted until later.Aside from all the crappy things there was a good amount of twists in it. And, uh, thats really the only good thing I can say about it. So heres why it was bad.1. Over done action scenes. In kids movies you'd see a car fall from a skyscraper with people in it and be fine. Thats a kids movie. Those are the kind of over the top scenes in this movie! 2. This movie is based around the Crystal Skull obviously going by the title but when you find out more about it near the end your like ""WHAT???"". In my opinion it killed the movie for me. 3. The ""villain"" was a Russian woman who I can't tell was suppose to be good, bad, sexy or not sexy. The bad guys in general were kinda boring and dull like the movie. If anything there wasn't much attention to fighting half the time since the movie jumped around a lot.4.This movie does A lot of jumping around. There's a comedy scene, a random scene that makes no sense, a fight scene, another random senseless scene, a chase scene, ANOTHER random useless scene. I think they needed extra footage. They had things like stupid gofers half the time when people would fall that would smile almost. Or a scene where the Mutt was swinging around on vines like Tarzan with monkeys. Trust me its MUCH more corny then it sounds.5. For some reason to me the CGI seemed really bad. I am surprised for both of these directors. 6. Lastly another ""bigger"" nail in the coffin is the fact there was no real Indy...well Indy stuff! Usually he looks for clues, looks for traps, sets them off, figures out stuff, ...you know exciting archeology stuff. In this? Not really. The temple(s) he simply walked in and out of pretty much no fancy puzzles or clues to untangle. No traps that were cool. Pretty boring. ===OVERALL (non spoiler version)=== Overall this whole movie from the minute you find out more about Crystal Skull really hurts the movie most. Some people are fine with ""the truth"" but they don't obviously understand the premise and background of the the series or Indy. The series has been about historical artifacts and what not. Not ""that stuff"" or stupid over done scenes! So this makes it the worst Indy movie for these reasons in my review. Hopefully the confirmed 5th one will be back to its origins and not any more crazy stuff, beyond silly scenes or whatever else they come up with.(((SPOILERS...THESE WILL RUIN THE MOVIE ENTIRELY!))) So what killed the movie for me then? Well I listed the some things above but let me actually go into the actual detail then.1. Some of the actions scenes for instance that were to over board were: -Indy hides in a fridge, and first off the fridge SURVIVES a nuclear blast that is about 1/2 mile away. Then past that fact he survives a VERY violent throw(nuke throws him) and tumble across a desert and then some! Oh and then he gets up out of it and looks at the nukes explosion even though hes still pretty dang close. WHAT?!?!? Lame.-Or the scene where Marion drives off a cliff HAPPENS to land in the only tree. Which HAPPENS to bend perfectly in to the water a distance below where she HAPPENS to be able to drive off of it PERFECTLY into the water (car is a boat/car thing) and it (tree) HAPPENS to snap back perfectly and knock off some Russians on the cliff climbing down. Lame. There are a lot of scenes like this that are past pushing the envelope of corny and ruin it.2. The Crystal Skull is an ALIEN SKULL. With ""supposed"" powers. Nothing really useful in the movie but it gets worse. The skull gets returned to alien skeletons where through silly looking animatronics they activate their UFO which even I have to admit looks HORRIBLE for CGI and lamely kills a certain bad guy and destroy the fake temple and it flys out of the ground...etc. The thing is huge but its a 50s looking saucer so if it didn't look bad enough being 50s looking it also was seriously badly done CGI. 3. As for the clues finding them, looking for traps...etc. I'll expand. -In one scene the massive clue to getting in the temple is... the crazy guys tells him to smash a rock to release sand. So everyone smashes these rocks and it works. WOW...that was thrilling. Thats about all the clue finding/guessing in the movie really since the crazy guy knows everything anyways.-Temples. In two scenes each temple they can walk in pretty easy. In the first they simply find it and take out the massive army of...two guys armed with blow guns. In the second temple there's a actually group of guys. They hold up the magic alien skull and pass them! Thrilling. Inside more guys climb out of the walls, no explanation how they got in solid walls but whatever. Then they vanish once Indy and his crew get into the magic ALIEN ufo thing! ZZZ.Yeah there's all your exciting temple/clue searching and doing for ya!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

746,rajesh-scorpi,"If adventure has a name, it's Indiana Jones !",8,2 June 2008,"The man with the hat is back  This time he is aged, accompanied by his son and his wife; Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal Skull has opened on 30th across India, and is receiving tremendous response all over. At this point of writing this article, it has grossed $359,881,000 world wide  it stands #116 in the world's top grossing movies till date  that too, within ten days of release ! I'm sure it'll gross even more and will stand on par among its prequels, in the days to come.Okay. Having said this, how is the movie? Is it good like its predecessors? Nice question. The answer  If you are satisfied about a flick and if there are more parts of it to come, go see them with an open mind. Don't always have the original one in mind and expect the sequel to be like the original. Sometimes, they do surpass the original & sometimes they don't. Well, then what category does the new Indy adventure belong to? To me, I loved it. It was interesting, every scene of it. I never felt bored for even a minute. Thoroughly enjoyed it.Before writing further, lemme tell about what I felt about Indy all these years. I saw the previous 3 movies a few years ago. I loved the first one, hated the second and again loved the third. So, when I got the news that it'll be released in India on 30th of May, 2008, I felt exited. I wanted to go see it the first show. 'She' booked the tickets in B'lore (Which again was a complete surprise  I never expected it), and off we went, to see Indy.As soon as Indy was thrown out of the car's trunk  his hat  the famous one  comes first, thrown in to the sand, and then we see Indy's shadow, pushed to the ground and slowly rising, wearing the hat  I let out a huuuuuge whistle in the theater ! From that moment, began the adventure, filmed in great style. Throughout the movie, Indy is first reacting to the circumstances and then starts acting on his own. The film is filled with fantastic CGI work, with good camera (Spielberg's regular 'man Friday' - Janusz kaminski). The screenplay is good throughout (David Koepp, again a Spielberg regular).This film also has something, which also is a 'Spielberg regular'  The Alien! It comes in one scene, without dialogues. Spielberg's love for the aliens is widely seen in most of his movies.Harrison Ford is terrific as Indy. He looks like the same man from the previous three movies, without being worn down by his age. He is fit, muscular and casual. This time, he pairs with his son and his first heroine (from Raiders of the lost Arc), to uncover the secret behind a crystal skull. It has been filmed in such a way that the tone of the film is exactly like the previous 3 movies. It's not digital, and it has the same kind of color shading. It figures that comic book kind of look also throughout. The stunts are also enjoyable. The chase inside the jungle, the final confrontation, the bike chase  every stunt has been well done.Overall, this movie will make you smile  Go see Indy and cheer for him, as he exactly carries on from what he left 19 years ago - adventure in full throttle !",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
747,Mudbug711,"Man, I get sick of this.....",9,27 May 2008,"I really thought that Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull was a great film. There were some goofs, just like the goofs stated on the main page of this site. However, it did feel nostalgic, and old-school. I loved it, Harrison it starting to show his age, but he looks pretty good for it. AND, he can still make you laugh, with just one of his many facial expressions... if you like Harrison, you do have to love that. The acting turned in by Cate Blanchett is like always..right on. Even as a mean, persistent evil Russian woman, hell-bent on power, she kicks gluteus maximus. Shia LaBeouf just keeps getting more mature as an actor with each passing role he does. Then, of course, I can't go on without mentioning Karen Allen returns as the loved Marion Ravenwood. Awesome. Now, she looks pretty good today, and was terrific!! The locales, and backdrops were great, the stunts are what you may expect from a Spielberg/Kennedy/Marshall driven action movie. All is on base here.I liked it, very much. Great acting, good cast, good cinematography. Good all around movie. 9 out of 10.With a cigar between my forefingers, I put my hand to my head, and say... ""Oh, just one more thing"". I just got finished reading the main page comment, and over 100 people read it thoroughly..... What the heck??? This person (whom is from Washington, I will not put his/her name here), was like telling you to not like this movie just because he had an opinion, and was shoveling it down your gullets like shoveling manure into a small burlap bag, and people actually take it into consideration what he says. WOW, I guess there are a lot of SHEEP in this world, for sure. Because, I believe when a number of people read, and take in what a guy like that has to say, they will go to the movie with a pessimistic attitude toward the movie, looking for the flaws, and negatives. Then, he has the nerve, and the gall to say ""When WE walk away..."". So, I guess this guy is speaking for everyone, huh??? Although, he is strongly opinionated, and he does have his right to that. It is the folks that agree with him, without watching the movie first!!!!!!!! That is what grinds our gears..people like me, the real buffs of real movies. I am going to buy that guy (the opinionated commenter) the dude from Washington, a shovel, a big spoon, and a toilet, so he can shovel it, stir it, and flush it, then he move onto the next film/director/producer/actor he wants to try to destroy. Whose telling us that all the Star Wars Prequels... Failed??? Yep, he speaks for everyone... Then why is it, that everyone of George Lucas' great films are in the top 50 of the ALL TIME BOX OFFICE...., huh???

748,snafux7,pretty disappointing,3,27 May 2008,"I think the sad part for me is that they COULD have made a pretty good movie out of it but once again Lucas decided to ignore the plot and the characters in favor of CGI.The key difference between this and the previous Indy films is that while the first three had crazy action sequences where Indy manages to escape by the skin of his teeth with a little luck and ingenuity, this edition was just plain ludicrous and impossible to believe. Many of other reviewers point to him surviving the nuclear blast so I won't delve into that any further. Some other scenes that were just ridiculous included: -Indy scrabbling up a stack of boxes in the warehouse, he's halfway up and there are a dozen 'soldiers' with machine guns a few feet away that cant even graze him...I mean really, to me thats just lazy production...have him fool them until he can get a believable distance away or something, sheesh -Indy Jr gets left behind in the high speed jungle car chase by getting caught up in some vines. Meanwhile the chase continues at full speed for at least 2-3 mins yet he still somehow manages to swing from vine to vine and miraculously catch up to them. Even at a modest 30 mph the vehicles would be at least a mile away and widening their lead unless he can somehow swing thru the jungle at an astounding pace. I tried to rationalize this with 'well the kids will like it for the excitement' until I overheard a 9 yr old after the movie asking his Dad how that could possibly have happened...that to me pretty much summed it up -Kate Blanchett's character and the rest of the bad guys were caricatures straight out of an Austin Powers movie...the jumpsuit and all, it was downright embarrassing, completely ruined any suspense in the film. Compare her to Mola Ram from the Temple of Doom, now THAT was a real bad guy! -Like any Indy movie there are a bunch of secrets and hidden chambers, switches, levers and booby traps but sadly they just sorta rushed thru them all in this film, never taking any time to develop the mystery around them and give the audience some time to wonder what might be coming next. It was like playing a video game that you've beaten a dozen times already, you just whiz thru the puzzles without a second thought.All in all I can't say I hated it because I love the character and the nostalgia factor was high but judged on its own merit alone it was pretty sad and disappointing, wait for the video.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
749,tapswedar,OK but disappointing,5,22 May 2008,"The fourth Indy film was neither good or bad. It was nice to see Harrison Ford in a watchable film in my eyes its the first tolerable one since what lies beneath. All the characters were fine. I found the story to be quite predictable. My problem lies in the fact that CGI was relied on way too much. Maybe Spielberg should have kept Lucas out of the editing room because i thought that there was so many times that the FX were arrogant. Just because you can do things you couldn't 25 years ago does not mean it needs to be done. Was there any animals used in the movie because i think they were all cgi. Not to mention i don't remember that much green screen being used in the previous films. Yes i know its cheaper but when you know the movie is gonna make every penny back and more then whats the big problem with shooting on location. I found a lot of the stunts to be over bearing as well because they were so outside the realms of reality its ridiculous. I am not one of those purist but to much cgi is too much cgi. Where was the great dialog that was used in the prior movies,could it be that once again mr. lucas was to arrogant to get back the same writing team. In my honest opinion the movie is fun but this is more like a national treasure then an Indiana Jones movie which doesn't make it bad but people who are saying this is worth an 8 and above on the rating either never seen the others or where starving for a indy jones movie.P.S. I would like to see George Lucas make a movie thats not a prequel or a sequel to any of his movies or ones he produced. I don't think he has got the stones anymore to make an original movie. So until he proves otherwise he is a Fraud.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
750,kowgirl_tina-1,"Sorry Indy, but you missed the boat with this one!",5,24 May 2008,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect since it seemed most people either loved this movie or hated it. Since I am a big Harrison Ford Fan (as well as Indiana Jones), I went to see it thinking I would love it; WRONG. While I still love Harrison Ford, the story line for this sequel was WAY over the top! Even the CGI images were out of realities reach. I saw a quote from one of the other users saying, ""what were they thinking?"" I so agree with that comment! Most of the acting wasn't bad, but with such a terrible story line, it didn't really matter. The first half of the movie had some great action scenes though, and Harrison Ford still has charisma! I have no doubt this movie will make oodles of money. If nothing else, people will want to go see what all the ""hoopla"" is all about. I'd tell them to save their money and skip this flick.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
751,isaacbbabcock,Disappointment verging on anger,5,10 January 2009,"I'm a big Indiana Jones fan. I have the first three on DVD, and have watched them maybe 100 times total. Needless to say Raiders of the Lost Ark gets the most plays. Compared to those movies, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was seemingly written and directed by a totally different group of people. In the first five minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, maybe half a dozen lines are spoken. It's all mystery and leaves the audience to figure things out for themselves. In the first five minutes of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull there had already been dozens of cheesy lines, and the majority of the bad guys' plot had already been revealed in nauseating detail straight from the characters' mouths. The characters are all there, though some of them shouldn't have been. The Marion and Mac characters were completely superfluous and added nothing to the plot, except to fill holes in it, in Marion's case. The important characters, like Indiana, Mutt, and the ruskie that Cate Blanchett plays do a good enough job and give it that sense of adventure that is otherwise forced by increasingly unrealistic predicaments. I just wish Blanchett's character could have held a candle in the intimidation department compared to the Nazis in the first or third Jones installment. The movie was also distractingly self-aware, giving a tedious amount of screen time to nods to the previous films, as opposed to playing on its own merits. The music was also an almost entirely recycled amalgam of the previous three films. That could be a good thing for some people though. It's just that most of those nods to the previous films are about Raiders of the Lost Ark, manifested through petty, forced relationship squabbles between Indy and Marion. On its own merits, the film falls flat. The movie starts out with many similarities to Raiders, but the plot then becomes convoluted and far fetched, and as a consequence of that most of the dialog is spent explaining what's happening in the current scene, and what's going to happen next. Almost nothing happens without being explained directly by a character in the scene, almost like George Lucas wanted to make sure first graders would be able to keep up. But the plot turns so much supposition into unbelievable reality that it's hard to keep following without asking why. The smart, dryly wrought mix of drama and comedy that made the original so special is tossed aside in favor of lame one liners and pseudo-emotional power plays. Many of the action scenes are either logically flawed or extraneous. When Indiana Jones tries to evade a hail of machine gun fire in one scene, he essentially runs directly in the line of fire when he could easily have jumped two feet sideways and ran behind a barrier. When a sword fight scene breaks out during a chase, the fight keeps going even after one of the characters gets what he wants, as if lengthening the runtime of an already stale sword fight would somehow make it more intense. That seems to be the philosophy with the plot as well. It just goes on and on. It doesn't intensify. It doesn't reconnect with itself at any point. The plot never builds toward anything. It just runs through a scene and then switches gears. You're only really told about what's going to happen next once the scene you're in is about to end. It doesn't build tension and then release it, because there's no tension, just confusion and then a quick scene cut. Apparently the producers thought it would be acceptable to turn it into a kid-friendly film by disappointing the rest of the viewers with CGI monkeys and prairie dogs too. That monkey in Raiders did an admirable job. Why not just bring him back? Well, aside from the fact that he's probably dead by now. Despite all this, The Kingdom is still worth visiting, but only to deepen your love for the original three films in the foursome, and to deepen your hatred of Spielberg and Lucas for screwing up a good thing. This movie could have stuck with the style of the other films, and turned out a winner even if it plagiarized the others heavily. Instead it eschewed the tried and true 1980's style epic film- making and instead tried to capture modern, presumably intellectually inept viewers with big explosions, worn out lowbrow humor, cartoon animals, and a total disregard for physics or reality in general. Of the four films, I'd put this at a solid #4. It's still better than most action/adventure movies, but it's not as good as the other three in the series. But my opinion might change, since I plan on watching it again. Hopefully it's better the second time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The script was terribly weak, along with the performances. In fact I would go so far as to say this was Ford's worst film ever.However, this isn't surprising given it was a George Lucas production - never have I come across anyone in the film industry who has risen so high, and then fallen so low.The only saving grace really was Shia LaBeouf, who did a good job - let's hope he doesn't use the others as a training tool!I'll leave it here, except to say that if they do make another one, might be an idea not to make Indy walk like he'd poo'd his pants....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
753,g0dolphins,a worthy new installment to the Indiana Jones canon,8,23 May 2008,"Let's keep this simple, shall we? If you are of an age where the earlier films left an impression upon you, this installment delivers in the same vein. Since the teaser announcement at last year's Comic Con, my two biggest concerns were; how would Harrison's age be addressed, and would today's advancements in special effects prove to be a negative? Let's face it, Ford would (and should) be playing an older Indiana, and that had to be somehow incorporated into the movie. Also, the previous films used the latest technological advances to support the over all plot, not dominate it. In both instances, these concerns were alleviated and that allowed me to suspend disbelief in everything else and thoroughly enjoy the movie. George and Steven captured the essence of whom and what Indy is all about, and that translated into a film worthy of addition to the Indiana Jones canon. When the credits rolled, the overwhelming majority of us who were in the theater on opening night gave a convincing round of applause. Our memories of Indiana Jones were enhanced by this latest tale.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
754,Deathtyger,Mixed Feelings,5,24 November 2009,I have always been a big fan of Indiana Jones...but this one well...it crosses into a new area that changes the way I have always looked at the Indiana Jones movies.Part of the excitement about these movies has been that they could happen that way..sure some things are way Hollywood but the basic idea's and concepts in the movies have been very realistic for the most part.I thought the movie was really good up till the ending sadly. Was nice to see that most of the same characters were used. All I can say is the movie is worth seeing at least once but keep an open mind.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
755,Sternicus,Fortunately for Lucas and Steven nobody *cares* about Indiana Jones.,9,9 August 2008,"Allow me to explain... you see Indiana Jones is like James Bond mostly because Indiana Jones is inspired by James Bond in that they are creative action flicks that exist for the action and tidbits of other stuff here and there and not necessarily for any other purposes. In other words Indiana Jones can have as many factual errors i.e. Indiana Jones shooting people with an RPG that wasn't invented yet... he can fly over the great wall of China and not even be in the area, and people can forgive that ,you know; I can forgive that because I don't go see an Indiana Jones movie for that. It would be nice if they did the research but it seems that's not the case. Lately I've been hearing people compare that Lucas ""did"" to this movie what he ""did"" to Star Wars, but there's a big difference. It's one thing if you make a mistake with Indiana Jones it's another if you make a mistake with Star Wars. Star Wars is sacred you see. You don't just screw up on Star Wars and expect it not to hurt the next movie. With Star Wars every movie has to have a certain degree of credibility... because there's continuity involved. With Indiana Jones all you have to know is Temple of Dooms a prequel, and Indy's dad died. With Star Wars you have to know who did what, why and how. They were more than just action flicks they were modern myth. Indiana Jones on the other hand is different because no one cares about it, people care more about Christopher Nolan's developing Batman saga than they do for Indiana Jones. You see if Nolan were to screw up in one of those movie (God forbid.) it wouldn't just be bad it would be Star Wars mess up bad, why... because of the continuity. Indiana Jones like I said doesn't really have continuity. Each individual movie is more like an random episode, if the public doesn't like an episode no problem Lucas and Steven just have to make a sequel that's better. Now to judge how this movie was individually I must say I liked it. Mixed with Stevens directing and Lucas's CGI this was Indiana Jones on steroids. This is probably more hardboiled than any other action movie out there(Unless it's The Dark Knight.). Can you think of any other place where you can find psycho jungle ants, aliens, U.F.O.'s, nuclear bombs, crazy natives, and Soviets all in the same film? And there was more of a mystery, and investigation in it too. For me... THIS WAS WAS THE BEST INDIANA JONES FILM EVER!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
756,intothebluegreatness,Just plain fun,10,25 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was one of the greatest movies I have seen in a very, very long time. Harrison Ford was an absolute wonder to see on screen again, as for his age looks astounding. I really am unable to find the words capable of explaining how astronomical Harrison Ford performed in this film, along with the supporting actor, Shia LaBeouf.I remember when I was younger, watching the Even Stevens series all the time. It was my absolute favorite when I was a kid. Shia LaBeouf wowed me when I began watching some of his first films, especially Holes. Then he began getting into even bigger movies, like Transformers that many people went to see. Now, he is here, in a highly anticipated sequel of Indiana Jones. He has developed into one of the great young actors of our time. Ladies and Gentlemen, this kid will be the next big name in Hollywood. He is absolutely amazing in this film, pulling off a performance that some of the best young actors of our time couldn't even come close to pulling off.The action scenes in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull seem to never stop. This film is incredibly fast paced, leaving you placed on the edge of your seat throughout. One scene I must comment on was the car chase and sword fight scene. My hat goes off to the entire crew not only for such a wonderful movie, but those scenes in general were enough to do it for me, and should be enough to do it for anyone.The humor, just like the classic, is still there, and better then ever. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull not only gives us bullet speed pace, but also a great number of laughs in between.Overall, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is well deserving of the A grade it received by critics, and is an overwhelmingly amazing movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
757,tnelson2-374-411051,I was actually angry when I left the theatre.,1,9 February 2020,"I'm going to start of by saying I'm a massive Indiana Jones fan. Raiders of the lost Ark is in my opinion, a stone cold masterpiece and one of my favourite films of all time, regardless of genre. It's two 80s sequels are also classics - Temple of Doom, whilst flawed, is just an absolute riot to watch, and the Last Crusade, whilst slightly derivative of the original, is still great entertainment.When this was announced I was wary of Ford being a little past it to play the role (and he is) with the same vigour as he did all those years ago, but I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. Also, I didn't have a problem with the roswell inspired story, area 51, nuclear weapons etc as it befits the time period.The problem is, this film absolutely stinks the place out in every way imaginable.From the opening scene with the paramount logo becoming a CGI mound of earth with a gopher coming out of it, alarm bells were already ringing before a single word of dialogue was spoken, and worse still, it wasn't the last time we saw these annoying rodents in the movie.The opening at what I presume is something like area 51 is ok I guess, but as soon as the rocket sled scene comes round and the gophers re appear, the film is already in big trouble and just gets worse and worse.I know these films can be over the top, but they always seemed to have the charm to pull off their greater excesses. I mean by all means include a nuclear bomb test, nukes are kinda cool in movies but the fridge scene is just so far beyond preposterous to be insulting to the audience, I mean the fact that said fridge is 'lead lined' like that somehow makes it impervious to a nuclear blast is just eye rollingly stupid, he would have simply been incinerated. The worst thing is, this isn't even the poorest aspect of this steaming pile, Ford just isn't believable in the role any more, Marion's character is just an annoying grinning oaf here, Ray Winstone's character spends the entire running time inexplicably changing sides, labeouf, whilst not too annoying, is just 'there' to provide a useless subplot of him being indy's son and to take part in some truly embarrassing action sequences - the jungle chase being the chief offender. I mean, what on earth were they thinking? I don't know what's worse, the dreadful, slow moving stuntwork, appalling CGI or the monkeys 'deciding' that shia needs help, then them swinging through the jungle like tarzan with him to take on the bad guys, I mean what idiot thought this was a good idea? Ants far bigger than any species known to man that can carry a large man and devour him in seconds? Please. By this point I'm just wanting it to stop. This film just has absolutely NONE of the charm or wit of the originals, all the action scenes are just repetitive, poorly done with some really sub par visual effects.The alien plot, which should have been intriguing was badly written, had no real stakes for the charcters on either side and was just boring in comparison to it's predecessors. Things just 'happen' on screen and it's never really explained and you end up just not caring or rolling your eyes and the level of sheer incompetence on display here.How can a director of Spielberg's calibre turn out dross like this is a mystery to me. It actually feels like you're being trolled watching this rubbish.An absolutely abysmal, embarrassing car crash of a film and one of the worst I've ever seen. If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted the uncut version of temple of doom as part of the blu ray box set this monstrosity would be nowhere near my collection and erased from my life.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The film retains the magic and fun of the originals. Indy might be older but he's still just as likable. I would say that to order the films in order of greatest to least greatest, it would be The Last Crusade, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and then the Temple of Doom. I do think that the Temple of Doom is a classic. All four have magical, unforgettable moments. This film did what Phantom Menace didn't. It retained the magic of the originals, and it could compare. It's also the funnest i've had at the movies in a long time. I'm glad Cinema's greatest hero has returned. Welcome back Indy.Also, the ant scene was totally awesome.

I had a great time and I want to see another Indy film. Yet, I couldn't ignore the several embarrassing moments that this movie had.The movie wastes no time getting started when we that Indy has been captured by ""Reds"" to help them find a very magnetized crate containing an alien who has a crystal skull. This skull has special powers and there may be more of them, which then starts the race between them and Indy to find it first.Despite adding some uneasy sci-fi elements to the Indy universe, I didn't mind the plot at all. The ride from start to finish was fun and I laughed out loud several times and the suspense scenes that their moments.Harrison Ford got back into the role just fine. Despite seeing some age in his face and his voice, he was Indy through and through. It was nice seeing him crack the whip, pull down his hat and sleep and many of the other things that made his character so enduring.Now, I have to comment on the many disappointments and outright embarrassing things about this film. Where do I start? Enough had been said about the ""Nuke The Fridge"" scene that I won't elaborate further except to say that it wasn't as bad as some of the other problems. I was looking forward to John Hurt being in the film but whoa, what a disappointment. All he got to do was babble and he was comedy relief by accident in most scenes. Why bring Karen Allen back to give her little to do but have one good argument scene with Indy and then just smile a lot? The vine jumping scene might have been better if the effects were done with more skill. And the three waterfalls may have been pushing it some.I love ""escapist"" movies and this was another enjoyable Indiana Jones film. I only hope that it can overcome the embarrassing moments and come back for another movie in a few years.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

That too after about two decades of the last one.And this comes from a die hard Indiana Jones fan who has watched ""... and the last crusade"" more than a dozen times.The movie is a sad attempt to cash on its earlier parts. The storyline (if you can find it) is thin, and so are any of the characteristic Indy chases. Most of the film is too predictable and only the thought that I had paid for the ticket forced me to stay put in my movie theatre seat. Of course Harrison Ford is good, and so are a number of the cast, but ultimately the movie simply does not work.Save your time and money - and give this film a skip.Watch the last crusade again if you want!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I know 70% of you are going to hate me for saying this, but-- I liked this movie better than the 3rd. There, I said it. And you read it correctly. This movie was in my opinion a fun roller coaster with action and comedy mixed with a great story. Personally I liked the ending (don't worry I won't spoil it) the ""Nuke the Fridge"" scene, and Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams.

762,merlinsk,"Not perfect, but a worthy addition to the Indy saga.",7,2 August 2018,"Now let's counter two main criticisms of this movie straight off the bat.... 1. The fridge; the focus on the fridge scene has been compared to ""Jumping the Shark"". Unfair. Is surviving a nuclear explosion in a 50's fridge really anymore unbelievable than freefalling from a plane in a rubber lifeboat? 2. Aliens; so what?! Is it more unbelievable than the Ark spouting spirits and melting Nazi faces or the Grail giving eternal life? Answer to both questions is no. All of Indy's adventures need a good helping of suspension of disbelief. When you're basing something on Republic Pictures Serials, that is exactly the point, believability comes second to action, adventure, thrills and spills.Now to my only criticism... the CGI. Now I'm not against CGI but I personally think that Lucas and Spielberg should've stuck to old school practical and photographic effects in the vein of the original trilogy. Yes it would've looked dated and clunky but that would've fitted nicely into the Republic Pictures Serials tribute that the Indy movies are. Yes a big chunk of the jungle DUKW chase wouldn't have been possible but my feeling is that it would've been more exciting to know that stuntmen are really carrying out some derring-do - like the famous 'dragged under the truck' scene - rather than knowing Shia and Harrison are stood on boxes covered in green blankets! An old school movie should use old school techniques so that it looks old school.That criticism out of the way let's review this by list - the Indy films listed best to worst:1. Last Crusade

767,imdb-211,Dr. Jones is Back!,7,23 May 2008,"So, Dr. Jones really is back. Is it all we hoped for? Of course not, that would have been impossible. But it's still an entirely enjoyable movie.I love the style of the movie. Somehow, the creators of Indy 4 were able to replicate the distinct picture quality of the early Indy movies. Spielberg even managed to go back to his old filming style with camera angles similar to the early movies, and there are tons of shots where it's obvious that the actors are acting in front of projections. In fact, apart from a few CG shots, the movie might as well have been made 20 years ago and been buried until now. Quite amazing.The typical continuity errors are back (yeah, I think they're entirely intentional). There are lots of cases where people and stuff move around between cuts. I was almost waiting for a mic to peek into the picture, but sadly, I never saw one.The movie is a huge load of fun. All the typical Indy lines and moves are back, pacing is okay, the story keeps going and never gets boring.All in all, this is way better than we could reasonably have expected or asked for. Highly recommended. Go watch.Having said all that This is no ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It's not even a ""Last Crusade."" It's probably about on par with ""Temple of Doom."" There are huge issues with this movie.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD The first disappointment was the very fact that the movie starts out in the storage warehouse where the Ark was put at the end of that movie. I always thought this was an incredibly strong ending for that movie, leaving the eventual fate of the Ark open for interpretation. While it plays no actual role in the current movie, we *do* learn that nothing actually happened to the Ark. Seeing it again kind of takes away the magic of not knowing. But that is quite acceptable.The next disappointment was the absolute lack of Nazis. I'm sorry, but the communists simply aren't a good replacement for Nazis. Nazis make for great movie villains because they are utterly evil, ruthlessly efficient, and entirely dark. No matter how outlandish the goal they're trying to achieve, now matter how absurd the means they're using to reach these goals, you can always believe that they really would have done something like this. The commies? Not so much. They may be evil, but they also ended up being quite incompetent. They're okay, I guess, they just can't hold a candle to the likes of a Toht (""Fräulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to""). But okay, so we have commies. Not as cool as Nazis, but we can live with that, too. However The third disappointment: The whole back story is entirely absurd! Yet another Steven Spielberg movie involving awkward aliens. You should think that he had his fill of aliens - E.T., Close Encounters, AI, War of the Worlds - so why did he have to put them into ""our"" movie, too? I much preferred the story of the ""other"" Indy 4, ""The Fate of Atlantis."" What starts out as a nice little Dr-Jones-Adventure-Romp quickly jumps the shark after about half of the movie and goes into a sort of metaphysical alien search complete with living alien heads, benevolent inter-dimensional super beings and an utterly transcendental ending.Which is the final disappointment: The ending. Why (and how?) does the person yearning for knowledge get punished? Why do the cowards who run away win? And, uh what the heck actually happens? So yeah. Definitely a ton of fun, and great to have Dr. Jones back. But ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or even ""Last Crusade"" this ain't. It's a great movie to watch, but thinking about what exactly you just saw kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I think I'm going to play through ""Fate of Atlantis"" again to wash that bad taste of ""alien"" out of my mouth.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
768,nmiodrag,Aliens 1 : Archeology 0,7,23 May 2008,"I saw the new Indy film at the opening last night, and had left the theater with mixed feelings. First of all let me tell you  I LOVE the handing down the hat"" idea  especially the last scene of the movie  and think Shia LaBeouf did great. Ford, who is also brilliant as ever, is definitely getting too old to continue the franchise so they decided to introduce the successor  new Henry James Junior (Junior). Indy has lost his Father and his best friend (Marcus Brody) and has traveled a full circle: he gets back with Marion, has an adventurer son whom he now calls ""Junior"", and finally settles down. This aspect of the movie works well for me.The rest of it is an inexplicable mishmash of incredible situations and incongruent subplots. You have: area 51, crystal skulls, conquistadors, El Dorado, communists and aliens. Did I mention ALIENS?!? Of all the archeology, mystery and hidden clues you have ONE note scribbled by a deranged archaeologist and that's it. This film has basically 2 relevant locations (Nasca in Peru, and the lost city somewhere in Amazon region), a lot of jungle, too much of waterfalls (one of the lamest and most overdone sequences in the movie)  and virtually no plot to speak of. I will not even go into the area 51 or the NUCULAR blast scene which was RIDICULOUS. After 19 years you come up with this?!?

769,PoochJD,Indiana Jones And The Abysmal Sequel,3,22 May 2008,"Oh my God! What a shocking and utterly awful sequel this movie is! I had reasonable expectations from the preview screening I went too last night, at my local cinema, but boy, was I disappointed.Firstly, there's little coherent plot. Yes, I know Indy has to return the Crystal Skull to its final resting place, but for 124 minutes, this does not maketh a movie.Secondly, whilst the film has an interesting start, it soon falters, and goes rapidly downhill (in more ways than one, I might add) about 20-minutes in. This should be a great movie: it's got Indy back on the big screen, but with Marcus Brody (actor Denholm Elliot) and Jones, Senior (Sean Connery) out of the picture, there's few characters to care enough about, and with such a sorry excuse for a plot, all that is left is a series of extended action scenes, loosely strung together, that are neither overly exciting, nor particularly well-executed.Which brings me onto the bug-bear that is CGI! The Indiana Jones series has never relied upon nor needed CGI effects. Okay, granted, that technology wasn't available to Spielberg and Co at the time, of the original Trilogy, so why use it now? Most of the CGI effects simply do not work. They look fake, simply because they are fake. Gone are the extraordinarily out-of-this-world animated effects ala the finale of ""Raiders..."". No longer are stunt crew needed, because everything and everyone can now be modified inside a computer. And therein lies one of the films issues: just because CGI can be used, doesn't mean it should be used! The scenes involving the deadly Red Ants; the death-by-rocket-engine of some Russian soldiers, and the discovery of the actual Skull's mystical powers at the start of the movie, are all executed by CGI, and they look hideous! It's not that the effects are bad, because they aren't. However, they don't fit in, alongside the historical nature of the Indiana Jones series. The blend is akin to oil and water. It simply doesn't work.As far as the acting goes, Ford is competent, but his age and vocal abilities are no longer what they need to be, which is a shame, because I can't think of anyone else who could (or should) ever take the role over. Cate Blanchett as the villain, is reasonable, but never really makes her character evil enough to warrant our caring whether she kills Indy or not. As for John Hurt and Ray Winstone, two of the greatest British actors of recent years, are criminally wasted, in roles that neither suit nor are worth filling by their talent. Hurt's is the worst of all. At times, he is merely there as a token gesture, and in all honesty, the role could have been taken on by a hundred other actors, even no-name ones.With regards to Shia LaBeouf, he is shockingly inept, devoid of any characterisation, and is simply a joke in this film. And a poor one, at that. One of the worst acting roles I've ever seen, with no redeeming features whatsoever. If he is to be a future big screen star, he needs to start learning how to act. Simply going through the motions, with as many facial expressions as a Botoxed-corpse, will not get you far.And now, we come to the great Marion Ravenwood, aka actress Karen Allen. What happened to the old Marion?! Her feistyness seems to have been diluted, and all we get here, is a slightly angry woman. I can't say too much, as I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but her return is not a cause for celebration. Her interaction with LaBeouf's character, is not convincing on an emotional level, and is ultimately wasted in the film, because she is underused.Lastly, I have to express my utter disappointment, at what should be a good movie. it soon becomes apparent, that the film is going nowhere fast, and it will dawn on all of you, that what you are seeing on screen is simply unbelievable! The stunts and action scenes are drawn out, to the point that they are simply by-the-numbers. As for stretching credibility, this film does that a lot. And I mean A LOT! The die-hard fans may be able to forgive Spielberg's lacklustre script and direction, but even by fantastical adventure movie standards, this movie pushes too far the realms of plausibility, so that it is nothing more than an expensive and overlong joke. If you can make it through to the stunning ""revelation"" about the origins and necessity of the Crystal Skull without your jaw dropping to the floor, then you really have no sense of cinematic decency! Simply put, this is a very bad Indiana Jones film - probably the worst of the series. It's an inept Spielberg movie, and may harm his future career. Even as a standalone action film, it's dire. This is not worth wasting your time on at a cinema. Wait for a DVD release instead.Spectacularly awful.... in every way imaginable. How can someone so good at directing, fail so miserably on one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history? Do not even bother with Indy V, please!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
770,prodosh_bhattacharya,Expectations Belied,5,17 June 2008,"I thought I was in a minority of one who was disappointed with the story-line, and I'm glad to see that that is not the case. The narrative tries to pack too much in from earlier Spielberg movies, aliens et al, and ends up with a confusing tale. Also, unlike in the 3 preceding films, the action disappears every now and then, and there is too much talk. Is this deliberate, in keeping with the fact that Indy is about 20 years older? If so, it still does not work. Why did the villainess - a fine performance by Cate Blanchett incidentally - have to die at the end except for the lame reason that all villains have to in Indiana Jones movies? The way she died raises more questions than there are answers.However, there are fine moments for lovers of Indy, the return of Karen Allen being one of the good things about the film. The FX are fine as expected in a Lucas-Spielberg venture. Could we please have a better Indy 5? One of the reasons why the story fails to satisfy is that the Crystal Skulls are something new, not something already part of myth or history like the ark of the covenant or the shivalingas or the holy grail. This is obviously deliberate, as the script writers planned to create a new mystery. But, as I said at the start, they put too many things in, and try to pay tribute at once to the fictional Indy and the real-life Spielberg and his earlier films. The result is a bit of a hotch potch. However, in all fairness, let me add that while I was disappointed, my brother-in-law, who accompanied me, loved the movie and said that it had surpassed its 3 predecessors!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
771,fegorleo-1,Disappointing,5,13 June 2008,"It took them a long time to show us some REAL Indiana Jones... at least the first hour ! I was so disappointed at first I thought it was because of the weak french version I was seeing. But no, no doubt, it was the lack of a real scenario that made me feel this way. She's a queen... as soon as she appears, it seems to me that the actress saves the whole picture ! Of course, Harrison Ford's awesome, his so-called son too, but please ! Come on ! That terrible first hour... 6 phases: the fake war-movie, the fake 50ies sci-fi -movie, then the fake-but always well-imitated, don't take me wrong- rockabilly part at the diner, come on ! I forgot about the 3 others, but believe me it was almost laughable. I couldn't help myself but talking out loud to my boyfriend who's also a fan, big time. We sighed at their jokes, hated their pursuits, liked the coming back -love and hate, teasing and fighting- but in the end I disliked the whole thing very much. Finished for me, no more Indie !",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
772,joecantongamingguru,Indy is back- but a little differently......,10,31 May 2008,"**********WARNING THIS HAS SPOILERS***************Now Indy is a classic film presence, no matter where or what hes in. I've been hearing internet fanboys bashing this film to the ground and in the dirt because of Lucas's story. Now, its nowhere near par to Raiders or Crusade, but its still very competent and is very well written with great wit and some cool dialogue that pulls the movie throughout. I went yesterday at 3:15 and it was packed! A cool 50 people were in the theater, and its been a week that its been in the theater! Now, about the movie. The film starts off with a group of teens driving next to a army transport. They take Mac and Indy out the car, then Cate Blanchett playing Ivana(sp) and is asking help to find a mysterious box in the warehouse. Indy finds it and inside, Ivana opens it and finds a weird hand with three fingers, which will come later in the story. Then Indy escapes, but I forgot one major plot point. Our friend Mac is on the bad side and betrays Indy after all their adventures. Now remember the hand, turns out it was a alien. Surprise! This is what the fanboys were over defensive about. But I find it to be a cool idea and a weird twist for Indy. Now, turns out the crystal skull(in the title) which Indy is looking for is the skull of a alien clan, which is in a tomb full of other alien skeletons. When Ivana catches up with them, she puts it on and the alien opens a portal to the third dimension. He then kills Ivana and a UFO pulls out and flies away. Now, this might sound a bit far-fetched and weird, but the sci-fi twist is actually good. Now, lets talk about characters. Mary is back....with the same actress. How many times have you heard that in film revivals? Anyway, the main thing that stands out is Shia LaBaouf(sp) which plays Mutt Williams, but later you figure out his name is Henry Jones Jr.III. Yep, hes Indy's son. Cate Blanchett was good as well, and she of course is necessary, but your wondering the whole movie when she is going to die. The script is strong and well written. And the directing is just spectacular! Its Steven Spielberg! Now, a lot of people might not like this film, and you know why? Because ever since they knew the originals, they've stuck with that forever. So when a classic trilogy gets revived, you really think everything is going to stay the same? No. Now, I personally think we should start calling it, ""The Indiana Jones Series"". So Indy is back and better than ever........with a scene with his arch-enemy....snakes.OVERALL-10 out of 10 GREAT",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
773,loddar,I feel cheated,3,24 May 2008,"...and I want the two hours of my life back I spend seeing this. This was a carbon copy of various scenes from the classic movies, and though there were some new actors you always knew was going to happen to them. See, the Alison Doody character this time was played by Ray Winston; instead of having to deal with his father this time it's his son; as usual Indy leads the baddies to the treasure which disintegrates as soon as it's found - and of course the baddies are killed by the treasure they desire.I kind of did not like how Nicolas Cage found some treasure mentioned in some secret book and thought it to be a cheap rip-off - but compared to this, it actually wasn't that bad.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
774,estebangimpe,Let's be honest...,5,5 December 2008,"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had a lot to live up to. The first three Indiana Jones films had a certain charm that made them the classics they are today. Even after 27 years after the release of Raiders the amount of fans of the series is just as large as any other movie.KCS was going to be bad. It was inevitable. Even if Lucas and Spielberg had placed a lot of work into it, the movie would have been no match when compared to the original trilogy. Lucas and Spielberg might have been onto this and decided to use KCS as an ""experimental"" film.Bad puns, overuse of CGI and a story which hints to Close Encounters but with a different name are things anyone can complain about, and these were some of the minor problems in the movie. The audiences were shocked to see how bad this film was. Honestly? did you expect anything good?The films entertaining for sure. There are some very cool actions sequences along with some cool chases and some great exploration. Despite these things, the only thing that seems to matter to the audience is that IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLDER ONES. I don't think this film is good but I have to say that people had a one way opinion about this movie. Yes it's bad, we get it, but here is a question: Wasn't it so fun to see Indiana Jones on the big screen for at least one last time? Come on! it's Indiana Jones! even if the story is a pill to swallow, you can still stick with him and have a great time.To finalize my point, KCS was made to recover that joy of seeing Indie on the big screen for the last time. That's it. You can say that Lucas only did it to make some more cash or that he has become evil or something, it doesn't matter: It was only a movie to go in, see Indie's hat and whip and go out. No moreI give this movie five stars out of ten. I don't really recommended it unless you're the sort of person who is just looking for a good time and nothing else.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
775,DaveGu,Could have been better - lots better,4,26 May 2008,"OK its the 4th. But after how many years, one would think that a group of people with the talent and resources of Lucas and Spielberg could conceive of something better than what I witnessed yesterday.While not terrible, it lacked the magic (I know - overused term) that made Raiders one of my favorite movies. Perhaps a little less CGI and a little more (and better) story would have helped; I don't know, I'm not a movie maker. I am a movie consumer and I would have liked a better product.Not suggesting others shouldn't see this movie, just don't expect too much. You'll be fine. Don't worry about the bad dates.Saw it for the second time with my wife tonight (5/31/08). It didn't get any better, in fact it got worse. I'm lowering my score in a minute. My wife didn't like it either.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
776,fosterino,Indiana Jones and the Close Encounters with Mediocrity!!!!,5,1 June 2008,"This movie plays out like a very strange mash up of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Goonies, and the Star Wars Prequels. This is not necessarily a compliment. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have brought Indy into the 21st century, and I sincerely hope they never make another one ever again. The original films were the products of an age where making good movies required talent, wit, and determination, whereas today most mainstream films are so laden with computer effects and plot contrivances that they get bogged down in their own grandeur. This is one of those films. When you examine all the talent behind the lens and in front of it, it's astonishing how much of a lost opportunity this film was, especially because some parts of it are really great. A number of chase scenes are very exciting, especially one that takes place across Indy's campus. In addition Spielberg makes great use of the time period (1957) as a source of atmosphere and action, as well as comedy. These scenes work because they are grounded in REALITY and we can relate to them. Watching them gives the impression that they took some skill and imagination to conceive of and execute. We expect nothing less of the Great Spielberg.Where the film goes wrong, however, is where George Lucas's influences are strongest. Maybe I still have some resentment towards him for ruining Star Wars with CGI overload, bad stories, and terrible dialogue, but he has basically done exactly the same thing here. Most of the film is so ridiculous, so implausible, impossible, laughable, and mind blowingly dim- witted that it's impossible to believe that you are watching a real film, especially one that has such great actors and a title with the words ""Indiana Jones' in it. Take, for example, the story, which I will sum up here: The titular crystal skull is the head of an alien. Anyone with half a brain can figure this out in the first 10 minutes of the film, but no one can possibly foresee the ending, in which 13 crystal alien skeletons morph into a single, terribly animated giant alien that disintegrates Cate Blanchett with its mind, conjures a trans-dimensional portal, hops aboard a giant flying saucer and disappears. Just in case the viewer is speechless (for whatever reason), Indy and a homeless looking John Hurt make cringe worthy observations about it, at times sounding as if they are reading their lines at gun point. This finale is the culmination of about a straight hour of equally ridiculous and only occasionally well animated garbage. None of this stuff is believable by any stretch of the imagination, like when Shia learns to swing from vines Tarzan style from a pack of animated monkeys, or when Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator and being launched a huge distance, only to kick open the door, get up, and strike a heroic pose in front of a mushroom cloud, apparently immune to radiation or sunburn. The next shot shows some poorly animated prairie dogs looking inquisitively at him, making cutesy ""????"" sounds. The real tragedy of this film is that it is the polar opposite of its forebearers. The Indy movies of old were smart and gritty, involving sympathetic characters and quests based around things that actually exist (if not physically, then in the collective consciousness.) This film has none of those. which is a shame because Harrison Ford does pretty well. I wish that Cate Blanchett brought more to the role, but its interesting to see them interact in a few scenes. They are dueling archaeologists but get caught up in their mutual excitement and scientific curiosity while scouring maps for the skull's location. It's little things like that that made the other films really special, but not this one. Genuine moments of classic entertainment are few and far between here, and I really hope that Indiana Jones died of radiation poisoning immediately after the end of this film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
777,danielledecolombie,Not that it matters but ...why?,5,31 May 2008,"The film is making zillions all over the world so what does it matter that it's just a mediocre attempt to recapture the energy, the youthfulness and the innocence of the previous installments? Love of cinema, that's what made me react the way I did. How can it possibly be that the most powerful people in the film world could agree that this was the script that everyone was waiting for? Shallow, opportunistic, over long, over crowded and implausible in a way the other films weren't regardless of their own implausibilities because one was connected tho the soul of the enterprise. There is no soul here to cling to. It's all by the numbers, odd numbers at that. Karen Allen returns! But look at the clumsiness of her re introduction.

779,philcold_59,What did Lucas and Spielberg had smoked before making this movie?,3,21 February 2013,"Did I lost something between the last Indiana Jones, which was wonderful, and that one? Innocence not, because I lost it long time ago, and before the first Indy. Did I maybe lost my head? It is possible, because I had a big brain accident a few years ago, which causes me a coma of 5 days... And I am verifying just now that it was just on the release date of that movie. But it seems that my stroke was contagious for Lucas and Spielberg, because they made a deliriously movie, where nothing stands, where the characters ring false, whose history has neither feet nor head, and where Indy did not even has his place.Instead of Lucas, I shall have finished the movie with a scene where Indiana Jones wakes up from a bad dream after delirium due to high fever. That should have made the movie more credible.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
780,frog663,An old and dear friend,8,23 May 2008,"I may be in the minority, but I was not disappointed in the least with any part of Indiana Jones' latest adventure. Harrison Ford did a wonderful job of recapturing the magic of Indy as an older man; something that, I would assume, wasn't as easy task. Admittedly, when we get to see Indiana for the very first time, it's hard not to have doubts as to just what Mr Ford would still be able to do, and where this story was going to be taking us. But it didn't take long for me to sit back and enjoy the ride once the story got started.For me, it was a given that this installment would be far different from the previous three. It was set in a different era, with different obstacles and different possibilities. It was also following the adventures of a man much older than we had last seen, so it would be ridiculous to expect that he would be that very same man. I found it highly entertaining to see what the imaginations of those putting this together would envision Indiana Jones to be like in his sixties.As well, it was nice to see Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) back. She, too, had changed over the years, both in appearance and demeanor. Yet, the spark that was so present between them in Raiders had definitely withstood the test of time.The rest of the cast, as far as I am concerned, did an okay job, but none were a standout. Shia LeBeouf showed that he can hold his own, action-wise, but his acting performance never came across, to me, as something a dozen other young actors couldn't have done just as well. And Cate Blanchett, as well, never really made her villain into much more than a cardboard cutout.That said, I would still definitely recommend seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, regardless of your expectations. Maybe you will leave after having seen it with the thought that you would've done some things differently, but isn't that what imagination is all about? I'm just glad to have been able to see my favorite college professor in action one more time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

You can tell that it's Steven Spielberg.Story: The story was one of the problems. Yes, it was creative at times, but Indiana Jones was rarely saving the day. Either it would be an accident that kills the villains, or simply someone else. In my opinion, he does nothing. I also think this movie would have done better with a different story as opposed to the one they picked.Music: I think John Williams was a little uninspired in this film. There were no new interesting themes or anything like that. It all seemed like recycled material from previous Indiana Jones movies.Meaning: The movie did have some meaning. It wasn't too random.Visuals: Let me just say, this is what CGI does to good directors: it makes them go crazy. They want any chance they find to use CGI, which ruins the story. Why, the film starts with complete CGI. Yes, it looked good, but there was blatantly too much of it.Ending: This movie had a suitable ending for the Indiana Jones trilogy.Last words: Really, this is like a true Indiana Jones movie apart from the overused CGI and the weak story. That's it.I'd include this one as a true and official part of the trilogy.------ OK, I have to make an important statement about how people are rating movies these days. This statement may be repeated in my other reviews-----------First off, you can not rate a movie a 10. There is no such thing. A 10/10 rating means the movie is ABSOLUTELY perfect. Only one or two movies out there are probably entitled to receive such a rating. I repeat, there is no such thing as a 10/10 movie.Second, NO MOVIE IS A 1/10 RATING!!!!! A 1/10 movie is one where you stare at a red dot that moves around the whole movie, with no meaning, music, or action, for an hour and a half. What would you rather watch, that 1/10 movie or this? Which is better? The work put into these movies is not 1/10, the story is absolutely not as low as a 1/10, and the direction... you try to do better. Only the few movies in the bottom 100 list are 1/10 movies. Besides those, anyone who gives a decent movie a 1/10 is crazy. For now on, rate the movie what it really is.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
782,Nirgaul,In need of mood elevators after this.,3,25 May 2008,"A couple of things about this movie jolted me. The first was the image of Indiana Jones in Boomtown, right before the atomic blast. It is one of the most surreal images I can ever recall. (And I'm a David Lynch fan.) A Saturday matinée hero, now an icon recognized globally, in the midst of a Saturday morning nightmare from the 50s. He is temporally out of place, a confused aging man terrified by a world where the rules have changed. And that world is figuratively, and literally on the verge of disintegration. There's nothing even remotely playful about it, and it blew me out of the movie.The other was the image of the flying saucer at the end. Yes, flying saucers themselves are an item of folklore, and so recognizable as icons there is almost something mythical about them. But there was no revelation here for the audience. We've seen aliens and alien technology so many times before that there isn't any payoff to this. Part of the thrill of the predecessors is that we have no idea what's inside the Ark, or what happens if you drink from the Grail cup. We've never seen these things addressed before in movies. That element of mystery, and of discovery is what made the originals so satisfying.Its no surprise then that Indy isn't nearly as resourceful in this one. Given his age, and the wisdom of his forebears, you would imagine he could ""My Charlemagne"" his opponents to death without ever having to throw a punch. Did the Holy Grail cure arthritis?Did John Williams pass on and bequeath his screen credit to Lucas and co.? There isn't a single new motif in this one, so it feels like there is no identity to the story. Ben Burtt could have created the soundtrack to this just as easily as a symphony orchestra.Lucas and the Infernal Machines of ILM. God, that man loves the green screen and Looney Tunes physics.

Well... not as bad as people want you to believe but, not great either. The first 45 minutes or so are fine (the motorcycle chase being the stand out) but then it starts to lose its way. Theres good bits and pieces, some nice sets but Spielberg has forgotten how to Spielberg. Ford is still game and its nice to see him not looking utterly bored in a film for the first time in forever but, as soon as they reach the jungle the movie falls apart. The villains are bland, the cgi is atrocious and the story is rubbish. Hopefully the 5th film will be a better swan song.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The last movie of his I enjoyed was Jurassic Park. Lost World was terrible. All his recent movies seem too silly, and contrived. Gone is the magic I experienced with IJ1, IJ3 (IJ2 was a disaster), JP1 .... And Lucas lost his touch way back in the early 80s with ROJ. He should refrain from writing scripts.IJ 4 was a total disappointment. Ford's corny one-liners notwithstanding, the movie's basic premise was silly. Aliens?!!

Don't think, just sit back and have fun.... & be a kid again, even if it's for 2 hours! It is more than apparent that Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Harrison Ford, and the rest of the cast and crew had a blast making this spectacular film and I think that most folks, as long as they don't take it too seriously, will have a blast watching it. Now, 19 years after Indy's last expedition, we have what is essentially an action movie executed at a very high level by a famously gifted director. And while it will surely make record amounts of money, it doesn't feel as if it were made solely for that reason. (How much wealthier could Spielberg and co-producer George Lucas  weighing in on the story once again  wish to become?) The picture has a lively script, some great effects and exciting set-piece scenes, but there's no recapturing the raptures of the past, the old thrills that once were new. There are the expected allusions to Indy elements of yore  Professor Jones in his college classroom and hurrying home to pack for another expedition; the creeping red line that tracks his flight across a world map; the onslaughts of icky insects (scorpions and killer ants, in this case) and of course a hateful snake.

786,jimmy2,Shows glimpses of the hero we know and love...,7,28 May 2008,"...but they are only glimpses. It's been a while since I've see The Last Crusade, but I would put this film just slightly ahead of that one, but it's definitely not as good or as memorable as Temple Of Doom.I enjoyed the sly winks that the movie gave towards other films in the series, and Cate Blanchette was a decent villain. I agree with one review of the film which says that she would have fit into any of the previous Indiana Jones films. She has this sort of timeless quality about her that a lot of actresses try to emulate but never successfully pull off.The appearance of Marion Ravenwood was welcome. Her attraction with Indy was undeniable throughout, even though she did her darndest to fight it. She lost a bit of her edge from Raiders, however...Speaking of people losing their edge, Indy has kind of lost his edge, too. That's kind of to be expected considering his age, and a fair number of action sequences rely on Mutt to pull off that we would normally see Indy do in the previous flicks.Which kind of brings me to the weakness of this film. The memorable action scenes that we see Indy be a part of are few and far in between. Outside of the opening sequence, there really isn't anything here that shows Indy thinking outside the box when it comes to overcoming the enemy. That to me was the real disappointment. It's almost reliant upon further establishing Mutt as the action hero versus the person we've come to see in the first place, and Mutt is actually one of the weaker characters in the film, IMHO. He does not have the charisma that Indy had in the previous films.If I could rate this film properly, I'd rate it a 6.5. A lot of time and effort was put towards making this film a reality, but the fact of the matter is time has caught up to Indy. He seems to be just a person going along for the ride rather than an actual participant, which is a discredit to my memories of Dr. Jones' exploits.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
787,dv909,Excellent...Yes It Is!,10,29 May 2008,"What I enjoy the most about Indy 4 is how unique it is next to the other films in the series and yet still familiar. Especially after all these years.Indy 4 is an adventure yarn chock full of thick exposition, packed with action, silly with humor, and finishes with a spectacular ending.I especially enjoyed the mention of Indy's life during WWII...""you know how many medals this son of a bitch has won?"" Sounds like he was pretty busy after the ""Last Crusade."" The moment when Indy is looking up at the nuclear cloud is no less an iconic image than anything else in the earlier films. It is a breathtaking composite of real world, CGI, and sound design. Well done ILM!In the context of the story, I admire how Indy picks up and is ready to teach elsewhere despite his lonely circumstances. And as quick as he's ready to depart on his own, he's even faster to get on the plane for another adventure.The best things about Indy Jones are all here. From the mystery of the historical legends, to the creepy crypts and the actual artifact. It was a real moment of character, well played by Harrison Ford, when Indy discovers the crystal skull and is baffled by it. He even asks Mutt what it is (as if...). But it shows that despite the skills that lead him to the discovery of the skull, he doesn't know everything there is to know and is even more compelled to find out.I absolutely love when Indy tackles his enemies. Ford has got that stunt down pat. He fearlessly throws himself across a short distance and barrels into a pack of men, bowling them over the side of the jeep. Just awesome. I thought Shia's performance was very good. The chemistry between he and Ford is undeniable. Indy meeting a younger and more rough version of himself was a very nice touch. And the benevolent way Indy 'fathers' Mutt as the movie progresses really helps to establish a bond between the two characters. There should definitely be another film with those two raising havoc across the globe in search of, I don't know, maybe Mutt's bike that he lost in the jungle.It was warm and fuzzy to see Marion back in the story as much as it was to see Sallah in the ""Last Crusade."" The fact that the filmmakers didn't give her more to do is a shame.I had the good fortune of being in a theater that had a lot of kids. When the goofy stuff happened their laughter was pretty infectious, as all kid's laughter pretty much is. I couldn't help but laugh myself. The gophers reminded me of my beagle so I thought they were cute. I particularly love when Spielberg directs with kids in mind because he is very effective, and he's always been that way.The ending was nothing short of spectacular. I personally have no gripe about aliens in this movie whatsoever. Indiana Jones movies have always played as modern fantasies for me. On a side note I believe there are many people in the world who 'actually believe' that human technology stems from encounters with advanced races of sentient beings. So for the filmmakers to explore that concept was very novel, entertaining, and not so much of a stretch for a character of Indy's 'out of this world' experience.The reveal at the end of the film was far more rewarding than the one in ""Last Crusade"" in my opinion. I always felt a little 'ho hum' about the climax for the 3rd film. After discovering one of King Arthur's knights still watching over the grail (and speaking pretty good English) Indy's just like, ""Ok which one's the cup of Christ?"", ""Choose wisely,"" the knight says. ""That looks like the cup of a carpenter. OK, thanks, bye!""Crystal Skull's climax is far more interesting with a flurry of excitement and visuals that are highly imaginative in their design and execution. Great job everyone!I am really happy with Indy IV. I enjoyed it more than I've already written about. Part of the reason is that I feel the filmmakers approached the project with as much reverence that I have for the character of Indiana Jones as a fan. All the money they spent on this film is all there on the screen. And Harrison Ford gives his most relaxed and charming performance in a long time. Early in the movie, Indy's friend says that they have reached a point where life has stopped giving and begun taking things away. How poetic it is that by the end of the film Indy gains a whole new family. Just really awesome for this great fictional character.All of this of course is in my opinion. I can understand people have different tastes and are better for it. But if I may suggest to the 'true' fans who feel disappointed, go see it again and keep in mind that it took a little time for ""The Last Crusade"" to grow on us because of how 'new and different' it was at the time. ""Crystal Skull"" has got it all where it counts, and even more.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
788,madmax_thegamer,Not all that it could have been!,4,22 May 2008,"OK let me start off by saying that I was really looking forward to seeing this. Harrison Ford's return to the iconic character we all know and love has been on my mind ever since I saw the first of the trailers. The movie starts out OK, with some neat action, a few good jokes and some nods to the previous films thrown in for good measure. After that it just seems to fizzle out and become another run of the mill adventure film. I feel that I got more entertainment value from National Treasure than I did from this movie. I just think George and Stephen tried way to hard to outdo the classic Indie films here. Harrison Ford brings back that sly charm and wit that Indy always had before but he seems to have developed superhuman abilities since the time of his last adventure. He takes more punches and kicks than a man his age would be able to believably endure, and survives so many unsurvivable events I began to wonder if he had a red cape under that old jacket of his! The bull whip is underused and most of the action scenes that come after the first half hour are so ridiculous, and obviously green screen that I had to bite my tongue to keep from groaning or laughing. Not only are a good deal of the action sequences super silly but the pacing of the movie is off as well. There are long sections where things just seem to drag as the characters yak on and on and on without anything interesting happening at all. Next lets move on to the supporting cast, which is OK at best. Caren Allen seemed more than happy to return as Marion Ravenwood because all she did was smile and laugh every time she was on screen. Shia Labeouf did alright in his performance, not standing out, but not phoning it in either. Finally we have Kate Blanchett as the villain, BORING!!!! Bring back the evil power hungry Nazis as bad guys! All in all I just felt like this movie was more of an insulting slap in the face to the original films than it was anything else. It was marginally fun, but far from gripping. See it if you want, but don't expect the classic thrills from the Indy days of yore. Give Harrison some kind of a new character to portray. A good thing should have been left alone when Indy rode off into the sunset with his father at the end of the Last Crusade.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

790,Deckard42,Indiana Jones is back!,8,26 May 2008,"First I would like to address the people writing negative comments about this movie: You are all just missing the point! Which is, that this movie is not a single step worse then any of the prequels. It delivers all you expect from an India Jones movie. There is just one difference between this and the old movies: this one came out 2008. That's it. If you just have grown up or your expectations towards a modern action movie have changed you might not enjoy this. But as you can see, many others do.Now about the movie for itself: It has of course minor flaws - like all the Indy movies did. The ending is a bit uninspired and could have been more captivating. (But then again, compare it to the plot of the second movie - which was much worse in my opinion) The characters could have used more ""personality"" - the only thing that really bothered me when watching the movie. Now the rest for me is just good as it is. Lots of great laughs, subtle and less subtle humor, great locations, the old way of storytelling and filming and most important of all: Indiana Jones! How long have we been waiting...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

792,Naomh,"""Noooooooooo....."" (and the music...)",2,22 May 2008,"Spielberg said that this film would be the ""sweet dessert after the bitter herbs' of 'Munich'"". Well this tastes like crap. Take it back to the kitchen! Second favourite franchise killed in a matter of 2 hours. Sigh...Why guys? Why? Why damage your own legacy when you must have known the script was below par. Waaay below.For me, one of my biggest gripes was the music. I believe the Indiana Jones films, have the escapism comes from the great soundtracks. In this movie they just reused cues from the other films. Even my girlfriend, who wouldn't be a big movie soundtrack lover, recognized the Knight theme from Last Crusade. There was one scene where they were knocking off those heads to make the sand come out that sounded like the tripod appearance from War of the Worlds. WTF? Indy in the refrigerator made me think of Homer Simpson and that ain't a good thing for such an action idol.Where was the sense of place? I used to love how the previous films allowed me to 'travel'. That because the crew actually traveled. Tunisia, Sri Lanka, Petra. Here they traveled to the local back lot. Honestly Jacksons island in King Kong felt more real that most of this.Spielbergs camera is always a joy to watch but a sense of magic was missing. All in all it felt LAZY. In the theatre I seen it at there was huge applause at the start, some laughs for the comedy throughout (which worked) but a limp groan from some, odd clap here and there, but deflated feel by the time it became Mars Attacks at the end and the credits rolled.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This seems to be the case for the modern adventure movie, whether it be star wars or James Bond. They just can't make em they way they used to and I blame it on dumbing dowon education. All the technical stuff is there, the actors are just as good but somehow there are no decent and credible scripts around.

All I can say is that, after almost 2 decades, I was more than satisfied. For those who are so intent on comparing the quality and lust of this film, with the echoes from the 3 predecessors, all I can say is that the best way to judge any film, is by looking at it's individuality. This movie has the elements of the typical Spielberg-Indiana aura which we've all become familiar with, and this movie, in turn, does not fail to hit on all the right action beats, which drive up the thrill, and desire for the unventured realm, dotted here and there with spices of humour, mystery, and even history. The movie starts off in the typical Indiana way, with Jones being presented on a gold platter, a challenge of an unexplained artifact/information/something to peak everyone's curiosity,and this in turn spells the beginning of a chase, not only by Indy, but also by the bad guys.. The unexplained riddles, drawings on walls, journey to south America, and the occasional spice of humour, allow the audience to relish the typical Indiana legacy which has been around for almost 3 decades.

796,Nobby21,Disappointing ending,3,5 June 2008,"I watched with my 14 year old son (An Indiana Jones Fan) upon exiting the movie theatre his excitement was not there, he actually said ""shall we go home Dad?"". Sometimes a ""no comment"" is as revealing as a 100 word summary. He moved on, and no more was said. I, Liked it, the CGI were exceptional, it was just the stupid ending that ruined it. Harrison Ford did a good job as per normal, I was glad Sean Connery was enjoying his retirement to much to be in it. It would be too much like ""Two Grumpy Old Men"" for my taste, ""always leave them wanting more"" someone once said. And I agree. I agree with another review here, when he said it was written by a 11 year old, on the money there I believe.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
797,BobsBrotherFutureman,The Secret War of Indiana Jones.,8,23 May 2008,"I won't bother rehashing the plot that anyone reading this is sure to already know. I won't bother to talk about how I ""grew up with Indiana Jones,"" or go into my feelings for the Star Wars prequels, as many have felt the need to do. I defended Spider-man 3 when it came to theaters, not because I thought it was without its flaws (there were many), but because I thought there were some shining moments in the film that I could not discredit from the Spider-man canon. For Indiana Jones, well I think the film is flawed but misunderstood. I, like most fanboys, LOVE Raiders, am mixed with Temple, and think Last Crusade is flawed but love it anyway. Crystal Skull falls in the category I've put Last Crusade in. It has its flaws, its plot is not completely fleshed out, but it's still a good movie. Everything an Indy fan could want. People forget Temple and Crusade were met with mixed reactions and took years for everyone to really appreciate, not to mention, many of us were children when we saw these films. The problems, flaws, plot holes, etc. were brushed off as ""Indy charm."" Short Round was not annoying, he was just funny. If he were in any other movie, we'd hate him, but he was in an Indy movie, so that was excusable. Things in the 80s, before action movies and movies in general, started trying to raise the bar and top each other, were more easily forgivable. I have no doubt if this film were made twenty-five years ago, it would be met with mixed reactions as it is now, but then again, wasn't Temple and Crusade? True, there is no sense of urgency or high stakes, the legend of the crystal skulls are not completely fleshed out, they never stay in one setting for too long, and in the third act, there isn't much Indy needs to do or prevent. He's just a spectator to what happens. But what happens is truly glorious and awe-inspiring, something Spielberg is good at. And while it does not completely make sense, did people exploding and faces melting in Raiders make sense? Did Henry Sr. leaving the tomb and his wound remaining healed make complete sense? No, because there was a majestic presence to the artifact that made us suspend our disbelief a little bit. After all, the world of Indiana Jones isn't exactly our world. Now I heard Lucas babble on and on about a macguffin in every interview that he was given. Maybe that macguffin was nothing more than a thin device not meant for anything more than Indys own redemption from his late mid-life crisis. One of the best lines in the film is delivered by Jim Broadbents character when he says early on, ""we're at the stage of our lives where life stops giving and starts taking away,"" or something to that effect. So his latest adventure brings two revelations, first, he has a son, and second, it's with Marion Ravenwood, the woman he never fully recovered from. And this is the redemption from his crisis. Just as the film could be called ""The Secret War or Indiana Jones,"" it could just as easily be called ""Indiana Jones,"" mirroring Rocky Balboa (don't get me wrong here, that film was terrible). Both are films about an aging hero we've grown with in a personal crisis. The film is more about their internal conflict than the chase. True, it can be both, as many films are. Indiana Jones has spectacular set pieces (though no single scene really stands out as the boulder scene and the rail cart scene, but we might have to wait a few years to see), plenty of action (though Indy doesn't use his whip as much as he used to) and as much absurd action and humor as the originals. Harrison Ford seems to have had no trouble getting back into character, but he's not the Indy from Raiders. Marion is not that Marion either. They are both older, mature, Indy is slightly more disgruntled and marion slightly wiser. But they are not out of character, they are their characters, nineteen years later. And just like that, Spielberg has directed like a director of these films, nineteen years later. In an interview recently, Spielberg said that if he filmed ""Close Encounters"" today, he would not have made Richard Dryfuss abandon his family at the end of the film. In that way, he has made an Indiana Jones film with the sensibilities he has accumulated over the past nineteen years. But he never loses sight of the character. Like his old self, he keeps the action framed in medium shots, kept the dialogue slightly campy, and looked to serials and b-movies for inspiration. The things that made the originals endearing. But true to the Spielberg who would no longer make Richard Dryfuss leave his family, the Spielberg who has aged nineteen years, effortlessly ties in subplots and nuances of loss, personal crisis, and undying love. If Raiders is about taking a leap of faith, Temple is about learning to believe in magic, Crusade is about letting go of obsession, Crystal Skull is about putting the past behind you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
798,marion-michel,Ummm...HELLO!,2,27 August 2008,"I own Raiders of the Lost Ark and the other two Indiana Jones DVD's. The first was unbelievable, the second had a more sinister tempo to it but still was great fun to watch. The third one was pretty good. Now for this one, all I can say is WHY?. The last one before this one was Indiana Jones and the temple of doom and it was good, he was older of course but he still managed to pull it off because the Dr Jones we knew has never been a young man, and if he had been in his twenties it wouldn't have worked. But the third one was made in 1989 and almost twenty years had past, and he was middle aged then. So you can't apply the same recipe here and that's one thing they forgot to take into consideration. Second, I would have to characterize this movie has being a cinematographic quilt. It is almost a composite of bits and pieces of the first and the the second Indiana Jones. I think it's sad because if they would have allowed themselves to think a little deeper, I am sure they could've come up with something that would have complimented the character in this stage of his life, and with that in mind they could have built a storyline that would've been more suitable. I mean I know that in the story not twenty years had gone by, but we can still see it on the screen. Third, I like Harrison Ford and all but even for a fan like me I can't help imagining that if there is a Indiana Jones 5, he wont need a whip, he'll need a walker. In conclusion, I think that this movie was big mistake from the get-go.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
799,john3-2,Disappointed because it could have been better,5,26 May 2008,"I had read both positive and negative reviews prior to seeing the film so I went in with an open mind. However, I had high expectations because of the three earlier films (well, two out of the three) and the money and talent being put into the film.The positives: Harrison Ford was excellent, LeBeof was pretty good, Karen Allen was good after her initial scene. The effects were quite good, not a distracting as the CGI in many films from the past few years. Good chase scenes, disturbing nuclear blast, and one cool over-the-top scene with ants (doesn't every Indiana Jones film have at least one over the top gross out scene?) The negatives: Cate Blanchett was wasted, the alien plot line was convoluted, Indie's associate was annoying (don't just break his nose, please KILL him), and there were many plot problems (escape from soda shop, then go back to house and read the letter?) So if you're a fan of the Indiana Jones films then you'll probably find #4 enjoyable. Considering how much talent and money was thrown at this film, you'd expect a better product on the screen. However, films like Pirates 3 show that money and talent doesn't guarantee great movies. At least this film clocks on at only two hours.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
800,MasterDebator5,Indiana Jones: Still Crazy After All These Years,8,28 September 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullDirected by Steven Spielberg. Starring Harrison Ford, Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett. With one of cinema's most beloved trilogies under their collective belt, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg ran the risk of tarnishing the reputation of their iconic films when they decided to make ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Nevertheless, the duo decided that it was time for Indy to dust off his fedora and prove to an expecting audience that the classic hero still has that crack in his whip.Spielberg once again occupies the director's chair and brings Lucas's story to the big screen. Nineteen years have passed since the last adventure, a difference that is accounted for in the film, as the world has changed for Indiana Jones. He is an old man adapting to the new social norms of the 1950s. Harrison Ford still plays him with as much wit and charm as ever, as he reluctantly faces the fact that his days of seeking out sacred artifacts in foreign lands are nearing an end. This may be true, but not before one final journey of car chases and sword fights, with some flesh eating ants thrown in for good measure.The film picks up on Indy in 1957, when anti-Communist sentiment was in full swing. He is wrinkled and almost completely gray, but the 65 year-old still packs a punch. This time around it's the Russians who receive the blows. Led by the sinister Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett with a thick accent and telepathic tendencies, the communist Russians try to get their ""red"" hands on the Crystal Skull in order to unlock its secrets.Jones teams up with Mutt Williams, a young greaser played by ""Transformers""' Shia LaBeouf. Together they also seek the Crystal Skull, which is yet another one of those objects of unspeakable power that the archaeologist always seems to be chasing.In terms of plot, the film isn't much different from its predecessors: Indy and his sidekick chase after a mystical object in various exotic locales. The Indiana Jones films aren't made to showcase thought-provoking plot lines, so the viewer expecting something different should think twice before watching the film. But if viewers want an adventure story with large set pieces and incredible stunts for which the films have always been known, Spielberg does not disappoint.Some of the plot - particularly the films' foray into inter-dimensional territory - may seem a bit far-fetched even for Indiana Jones, but the minor flaws are outweighed by the enjoyment of seeing the classic hero back on the big screen. ""Crystal Skull"" is mindless fun of the highest caliber. It may not be nearly as good as the 1981 original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it shows that Indy can still be just as exciting. As Indiana Jones himself said not too long ago, ""It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."" He still has many miles left in him.Final Grade: B",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

From start to finish it's an insult to the previous Indiana Jones movies. The story is totally unbelievable, even for an Indiana Jones movie. The acting is terrible, no matter how good singer of the actors really are. The lightning in every scene is wrong and 90% of the cgi is a joke. Even some amateurs with a descent computer and Blender can do that way, way better! Hell, the digital effects in the original ancient Indiana Jones movies were much better....

802,Streetballa,Confirms my deepest fears,4,29 May 2008,"I'm not going to pretend that I didn't have high hopes for this movie. I had high hopes that it would even be made to begin with. I was one of those of the internet generation who have been following the failures and setbacks of the movie since 2003. So when it was announced that the movie was finally being made, I was ecstatic.When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a bit of a letdown. The shots were not what I pictured for this film, and the amount of CGI even just in the trailer made me uncomfortable.Of course, then I saw the reviews. Initially, the movie was rated a 9.2 on here (since fallen to 7.3) I figured that most of those votes were just fan boys who were going to vote 10/10 no matter what. Yet, I saw a lot of favorable reviews from critics including Ebert who gave it 3 1/2 stars.Then the viewing. During the first three minutes of the movie, I was rife with anticipation. The opening credit sequences were exciting and they fed on the anticipation wonderfully. At that point, the movie was a 10/10. (I even forgave the CGI gopher) It was strange though. As soon as Indy came on the screen, all of a sudden it just seemed dead to me. I started to have uneasy feelings that this movie would be a letdown. Those feelings only worsened as the film went on.All in all, what I learned from this picture was what everyone learned years ago with the star wars prequels. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have lost what movie making sense they had. It was that special innovative quality that relied on good story telling and creative on camera techniques. Such for both of them has been scrapped in favor of flair, CGI, and style over substance. The longer you watch the movie, the more apparent that becomes.The movie itself seems incredibly unnatural in its delivery. The plot is forwarded by small forced intermissions (in some places the only saving grace of the film) in between the wholly unrealistic action. Let's just say that this movie takes suspension of disbelief to a whole other level. It's actually so bad that you begin to lose faith in the story itself, because it's just too cartoonish. With as much as the characters survive from things that would almost assuredly kill a normal person, you start to feel like you're watching loony tunes instead of Indiana Jones. This is apparent in the second half of the film especially.What really angers me is that this film had such great potential. There were things in the movie that actually just seemed out of place and not in tune with the rest of the cartoonishness. I'm convinced that these were elements left by Frank Darabont from his original script. It's a very big disappointment that his script was rejected, because I felt that it had so much more potential than what we received with the one we got. Maybe it would have forced Spielberg back to that innovation, back to that good storytelling, back to all the things that made the first three Indiana Jones movies special. Or maybe it wouldn't have mattered at all. Sadly, we'll never know.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
803,zuccozoid,Disgraceful dumb-down,1,9 October 2008,"Not since ""Phantom Menace"" have I been so disappointed - yet another major franchise down the tubes. Spielberg must have directed this from his yacht with a blackberry, letting film students do the grunt work. You have to wonder if Lucas and Spielberg had a contest as to who could come up with the most stupid - and trite - situations.Spielberg jumps the shark early with the now infamous ""fridge bomb"" scene. True, part of Indy's schtick is getting out of nearly impossible scrapes, but it's always because of his skill, his wits and brass balls. Herein, our mega-millionaire auteurs put Indy and company into ridiculously impossible situations, and mere luck gets them out of it (such as the triple-waterfall plunge). The ""writers"" brazenly steal themes, scenes and plot elements from other movies, especially from THE MUMMY - and even steal from their OWN movies! A power duo like Lucas/Spielberg can literally do anything they want in Hollywood, but chose the easiest and sleaziest ways out, sticking their fingers in their fans' eyes in every frame. Most of the action scenes are obvious CGI's, and there are more than a few very poorly done green-screen inserts. Hitchcock could get away with that in the 60s, but today there's no excuse, especially when you have a budget greater than the GDP of most third world countries.NOTE TO Hollywood CONEHEADS: CGI is no longer special - we can spot it a mile away; film-making 101 - if you can see the special effect it's NOT a special effect; CGI is completely overdone; remember most of your audience has been raised on video games, and your movies have become video games with no joystick.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

805,todddaco,THIS was the script that Harrison Ford was waiting on?,3,27 February 2019,"Harrison Ford wanted to do a new Indiana Jones movie, but wanted to make sure the script was right. Well, if this right, I'd hate to see the wrong ones.Two things killed this movie for me. Shia LaBeouf, and the idea that they were gonna turn the franchise over to him....God help us! Luckily, Shia went a little crazy and said some bad things, so he never became the new Indiana Jones type character, but unfortunately, this movie seemed to put all of its eggs in that particular basket. I think the premise was ok, but things like the crazy old man, and Indiana's ""friend"" who we couldn't figure out what side he was on, ruined it. I get it, it's supposed to keep us guessing, the old Hollywood plot twist gone crazy, but it was al just to much of a mess. Seeing Harrison Ford reprise his role was amazing. He hasn't missed a beat and still slides into the character with ease. Fighting the Russians was probably a good way to go since Nazi's are no longer available in the 50's, but theres something about Indiana Jones fighting Nazi's thats really just satisfying. I miss it.This movie had such a big build up, that it was bound to disappoint some people, but I don't think anyone had any idea of the let down that was in store for them.

Bad guys who are really bad guys and you don't know their agenda, our hero in peril, friends that may or may not be friends and so on. And it stays that way about halfway through the movie.It's downhill from there. Scenes that are supposed to be funny come out as idiotic, scenes that are supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat with expectations make you go ""yeah, right"" and so on.And don't get me started on the ending where mystery of the skull is revealed. I got the feeling director was aiming for something like ""Last crusade"" only with better effects and CGI but what came out is overdone, idiotic ending. Less spectacular would be much better. While the explanation of skull origin and power is interesting but how it all ties in the end is badly done.I'll give it 4/10 for first part and the fact that Ford can act.

807,Sandy-99,Flat and predictable,4,1 June 2008,"Who should be held responsible for this mess? The actors who phone in their performances? David Koepp, who allegedly finished off the script begun by a thousand others, but forgot to remove the dead ends? George Lucas, whose claim to fame is deserved only for 'Star Wars' (not the trilogy, just the first in the franchise) and who has since had the reverse of the Midas touch? Steven Spielberg and Michael Kahn, who skilfully edited any tension and excitement out of almost every sequence? Or Hollywood, for deciding that all cinema-goers want is more, more, more of the same, same, same.So much of what was on offer has since been surpassed by so many others since Indy hung up his hat and whip, but producers and director appear to inhabit a space between the spaces where cinema has apparently stood still. Peter Jackson has not made LOTR, Steven Sommer has not made The Mummy and teenagers still yearn to be James Dean or Marlon Brando.The Fifties may mean a lot to George and Steven, but they don't play well to an audience whose majority will know little of the icons used here, except from the movies themselves. And where Nazis are an international symbol of Evil, the Russians were, at least in popular terms, only an evil for a communist-obsessed USA.This film (a misnomer, since there is more than one film inside struggling to get out) is dull, witless, overlong and predictable.

808,Agita,Temple of Doom is no longer the worst Indiana Jones film.,4,26 May 2008,"For those of you who always grumbled about TEMPLE OF DOOM...hold onto your hats! The bottom slot in the series has a new occupant.I've been reading for years about Lucas and Spielberg developing the screenplay for Indy 4 - from all the secrecy and long list of talented writers who litter the road leading up to this event picture you'd think it was something worth waiting for...you'd be wrong. I would love to read Frank Darabont's screenplay because judging from his past work it has got to be worlds better than the abomination that was hurled up on screen as an insult to all Indiana Jones fans around the world.If there could be one note that George Lucas should seriously take to heart it's this: Forget about CGI, just...forget it, would you? Make an animated film, or don't. The fact is having a tool that allows you to do ANYTHING keeps you from THINKING about what you SHOULD do. So instead of figuring out what you NEED to tell the story, you throw the kitchen sink at the audience...it makes NO SENSE.The series of films, this is the fourth installment of, is called INDIANA JONES, it's the main character's name...and this film seems to have no interest at all in character. It's like a sick joke on viewers.There isn't really even a story. The Russians have Indiana at the start of the film, and Indiana escapes. The Russians catch Indiana again...and he escapes. The Russians catch Indiana yet again! You get the picture. It's like they wrote 20 pages of script, and then just xeroxed them and changed the scene headings to different nifty CG environments they had handy. I haven't seen a waterfall scene as exciting as this one since The Little Rascals, but that's not all....spoilers ahead:* Indiana Jones surviving a nuclear blast? * Indiana sees Marion for the first time in 20 years and it's the most unrealistic uncomfortable moment in the movie. * Indiana discovers he has a son and it's nothing more than a cruel joke the rest of the movie. * Mutt swinging from animated vines with animated monkeys and OUTRUNNING CARS? WHAT?! Worst scene in the movie. * Space aliens? I mean, this could have been a great addition, but the way it's handled here is nothing short of lacking in the imagination department. * The plot...never shows up, and people, neither should you.There are certain set pieces that are fun, to be sure...and it's because of these that I rated the film 4 stars...but the truth is that it should be rated 1 star for the opportunity lost forever to make a great addition to an amazing franchise.The good news is that if you've already bought the Indiana Jones DVD box set, this movie can't ruin it!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This had to be the worst Lucas-Spielberg film I ever saw and one of the worst films I have ever viewed in my 74 plus years. It was a total waste of time and talents. I really think I can make a better film then this -- almost anyone could. I sure hope that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas read these IMDb comments. If so, maybe their next film will be worth seeing. I should try and find out how to contact them and demand of each of them $3.75 for a total of $7.50, or maybe take them to court for this sum. The lawsuit would charge them with false advertising. They claimed this film to be entertaining. To whom was it entertaining? Other then a very few interesting special effects such as sliding rocks and bugs eating people, this film was total trash. The entertaining part was when it ended. Yes, I came close to walking out several times. The business with the Russians was ridiculous. Are these guys trying to get the Cold War going again? Is this film going to be a hit in Russia? How could Steven Spielberg, with so many great films, be involved with something like this.

810,super-joey,What happens when great characters get bogged down with boring details?,4,24 May 2008,"Pros...1- Ford is still Indiana Jones. His age does not hurt this movie. Loved him! 2- The music was very good.3- Some of the action was exciting.Cons...1- The characters are good but their interaction was often dull (and laden with boring dialog). I missed the human element that was present in the other Indy films. Do you recall his interaction with Shorty in Temple of Doom? Or with his father in Last Crusade? Well, Crystal Skull has nothing even close to that. Not even in the same ball park.2- There wasn't enough UNIQUE action. For the most part we get car chases and fist fights. The other movies offered us things we'd never seen before: Like the giant boulder in Raiders or the mine car chase in Temple of Doom. Where was that creativity in Crystal Skull? 3- We get very few truly indelible images or moments. Nothing like the pit of snakes in Raiders. (The CGI ants didn't cut it for me.) Most of the images in Crystal Skull are forgettable.But it gets worse . . .4- The plot is very tedious. We get a lot of dull talk talk talk about the crystal skull and its history. We listen to many conversations about hieroglyphics, maps, etc. Most of the dialog felt bogged down with boring exposition and explanation. If the characters didn't have to explain something boring every couple minutes, they'd have nothing to say! The ""object"" in these movies should never be the driving force in the dialog or story. It should just be a tool.Look at Temple of Doom... Was that movie ABOUT the rock? No. It didn't spend 70% of its running time talking about the rock and trying to convince the audience of its importance.Look at Last Crusade... The Holy Grail was merely a device to advance the plotting. But the movie was not ABOUT the Holy Grail. It was about Indy and his father. It was about their adventure.Part 4 should have taken a lesson from its predecessors and not made the object (the skull, of course) the central focus. It's merely a macguffen and should not be taking up this much screen time. It's not fun to feel like you're in history class while watching an Indy movie.5- The ending to Crystal Skull was atrocious. It was a lot of flashy images and loud sounds but no substance. I understood the endings to the other movies and found them satisfying. God smites Nazis? Yay! I dug that. But the ending to Crystal Skull left me scratching my head and asking, ""What was that about?"" Conclusion . . .A fair action/adventure movie. Nothing more. And I'm not saying this because my expectations were too high (as many will no doubt presume). I say this because the movie did not deliver a coherent, satisfying story. It had great characters/actors but didn't know what to do with them.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
811,iso-kincses,Simply forgettable,3,22 May 2008,"I went to see this film with no expectations at all so it hasn't turned out to be a disappointment. Ford looks all right for the role, but he should pass the hat now to Shia LaBeouf. He could easily have stolen this movie like he did in Transformers, but unfortunately his character wasn't so well developed, and he had lesser chance to prove his comic timing than he should have deserved. Blanchett is good as villain,though I haven't heard the accent as the film was dubbed. The good villain always have a bit of our sympathy and I really had my fingers crossed for her when she was escaping from the ants. The fencing and the ""carchase"" in the jungle was the only real highlight of the film (mind you: LaBeouf and Blanchett took the best part of it) the rest is old school adventure blended with some close encounters of the third kind or what have you... The story was too flat for my taste, the odd joke was not so memorable either, and the ending is just banal. There was also a big gap where some intelligence should have been (riddles or following clues or at least something that verifies Indy as a professor instead of a weathered tomb-raider-turned-to-ex-agent or what is he really now??)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
812,wise king,A major disappointment,4,24 May 2008,"Being a huge fan of the indiana jones series I was both excited and nervous about this 4th installment. Excited because of all the stuff I had heard from Spielberg, Ford etc about how it would be made in the same spirit as the first three, with old school stunts, no CGI, and a fantastic script that had taken 10 years to perfect. Nervous because of the law of diminishing returns, with Last Crusade not as good as TOD and that film not being as good as Raiders.Well unfortunately I was right to be nervous as this film is a major disappointment. If it were any other film it would be so-so, but as its an Indiana Jones film, I'd have to class it as pretty bad.It doesn't start off too bad, with a chase through Area 51 (the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant from Raiders), with the villains of the piece being the Russians replacing the Nazis. From there on however it goes downhill, with terrible ideas coming thick and fast. How bad are these ideas?Surviving a nuclear bomb by hiding in a fridge?! CGI gophers! Shia Lebouef as Marlon Brando wannabe Mutt Williams who has a connection to Indy, only people with single digit IQ will not be able to guess what that connection is. And this is only the first half of the movie the second half gets worse.More CGI with Mutt swinging through the trees with an army of monkeys! Comedy blows to the groin, over and over again! Yet more CGI in the form of killer ants!Following on from this is the most over the top ludicrous ending that you will ever see that provoked groans from the whole cinema at the screening where I saw the film.I know people will say that its meant to be a B movie homage, but here's the fact if you spend a hundred million dollars plus on a film it Isn't a B movie. Also if you spend that much make sure some of it goes on a script.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
813,hoobits,Indy 4 is a product of its era trying to escape back to another one.,8,22 May 2008,"I am actually going to write about this film on here! Wow... what a surprise. OK, here we go...""Raiders"" was lightning in a bottle, I don't think anyone really denies that, even if they don't care for the film. It was made at a time when magic was in the air, it was a time of discovery and development in advancing entertainment, finding a formula that worked... and people had fun doing it. There was an innocence and an exuberance to it all.And so now here we are in 2008 where the blockbuster film has become a bloated, convoluted, soulless or near soulless amusement park exercise with little to care about beyond ""in the moment"" entertainment. Ironic in my opinion that ""Raiders"" helped get us here, a film that so gets that entertainment formula right, with sequels, THREE sequels that try to, and both succeed and fail. Seeing another Indy flick is making comparisons to the others, so when it gets down to it this is how it goes:Indy 4 matches up about the same with Temple of Doom and Last Crusade, when it works, it works like gangbusters, when it doesn't it gets boring or has no sense of peril or flow. Crystal Skull has a stellar opening third setting a firm and fun foot in welcoming us to 50s Indy and stumbles up and down a sometimes sturdy, sometimes shoddy set of stairs after that. My main issue is the script itself, not the story which is a good idea... There is just not as much of a dynamic between its characters. There are moments but they are sparse. Nearly zippo snappy dialog. More flat exposition. Ford, LaBeof, Blanhcett and Allen are all good. They sometimes just don't get that much to play with and end up going on a sort of Raiders/Last Crusdae combo amusement park ride in the third act that throws any idea of a character arc or participation in solving/saving the day/lives out the window, which in turn cuts any sense of peril and that hurts the film. Indy getting dirty, making mistakes then getting it right is what is so much fun about the other films, it happens here too, but more times than not he just kind of plods along. Big action sequences get tedious, loud, just barely holding together, but the smaller, more practical ones work. The one thing that would have helped the film in these regards is to scale it down a bit, Indy films are over the top for sure, but not Loony tunes physiques over the topA lot of practical effects work still thrives and the CGI is used fairly well until the big numbing finale. Ants are good. Tarzan Shia not so much.I could go on and on and on... in the end I loved it one moment then I was mixed about it but I never hated it. But really after so many years what would one expect? Yes, they should have made this thing back in the early 90s but Spielberg had to go all ""Schindler's List"" on us so there ya go...In the end Indy 4 is a product of its era trying to escape back to another one. It almost succeeds in this but can't quite escape, the numbing, convoluted action/adventure films of the 21st century. Technology changes art and thus audiences as there is a resonance and effect to everything, so what is demanded (whether it is wanted or not) nowadays is certainly a former shadow of what once was. We are too aware to the point of not being. Our senses have been fried and it seems the only way to try and get through is to fry them again and again until one is numb. Where is that spark? That whiz-bang pizazz that'll really get things in motion with soul, flow, peril... Indy 4 reminds us that it is all still out there we just need better screenwriters to help us find it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
814,kufurex,Entertaining movie if you ignore the glaring problems.,7,27 May 2008,"Most of the criticism is ill placed. Yes there are scenes and sequences that are simply ridiculous: Surviving a 'nucular' (Indy has made friends with Bush) blast by taking cover in a refrigerator Junior vine-swinging through the jungle canopy like a freakin' monkey Portions of the jungle car chase scene (e.g. foliage to the crotch while balancing on two cars by Junior) Some have commented on the ending and its ruinous effect on the movie; however, I really didn't see it as a problem. Why can't Indy come upon an archaeological discovery that leads to alien life? This was a none-issue.The movie does seem to suffer from Lucasitis and Spielberg is not at the top of his game, but the movie is overall entertaining and a fun ride if you are willing to let go of some of the supremely over the top scenes.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
815,Cards_fan,Unbelievably awful,1,22 May 2008,"I really can't believe how bad this film was. ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"" and ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"" are both great and highly entertaining films. ""...Temple of Doom"", unfortunately, was an exercise in excess; most everything was over the top or just plain corny. At times, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" falls into some of those same traps but what's worse, that is the least of it's problems. The script is an aimless mess that is made worse by the terrible dialogue. It would be easy to blame Lucas for all the film's shortcomings but the direction is just as bad. Many scenes are incredibly contrived and feel like a bad made for TV movie. Spielberg's direction of Karen Allen as Marion is particularly bad as she smiles and acts over the top completely oblivious to what is going on around her. The film takes place in 1957 and to make sure that everyone is aware of this, they cram every '50s stereotype into the first third of the film. I think the fact that there was a caption saying Nevada 1957 got that notion across. Despite the presence of Harrison Ford and the occasional strains of the Indy theme fanfare, it seldom feels like an Indiana Jones film. It was tedious, predictable, badly written, and poorly directed. Even the special effects were substandard. There isn't much nice to say about this film. And what was up with the monkeys and prairie hogs?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
816,brimatt2412,Blanchett and Ford make this a fun time at the movies.,9,26 May 2008,"I came into this movie not expecting the second coming. With all the hype Indiana Jones 4 had received due to long running rumors about when the movie would finally be made, it was inevitable that the movie would create a division between people who enjoyed it and people who would be severely let down.While I thought they could have tackled a better storyline than aliens and crystal skulls, nevertheless, I came in just hoping for a good time and didn't expect the aforementioned second coming. Lo and behold, the movie delivered on a good time thanks in large part to Cate Blanchett's and Harrison Ford's performances.It was great seeing Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones again. It was a long time coming and he didn't disappoint. It was like being reunited with an old friend. They worked the age factor very well into the film, and Ford was his usual stellar self.Cate Blanchett, simply put, stole the show. It was quite clear she was having a blast playing the villain Irina Spalko and it reflected in her enthusiastic performance which gave a whole lot of life to the film. The charismatic Spalko is a more than worthy addition to the pantheon of Indy villains.Shia LeBeouf, who I doubted when he was first casted, does a good job as Mutt Williams. Karen Allen's return as Marion Ravenwood was a delight and her chemistry with Harrison Ford was fun to watch. And its always good to see Ray Winstone, who is becoming one of my favorite character actors.The movie has its flaws - I wasn't too crazy about the alien storyline, and some of the moments, such as the Tarzan moment in the jungle go a bit too over the top.

Why, oh why didn't they make 'Fate of Atlantis'? The perfect story was already there. They could even have transferred it from the Nazi to the Cold War era, with the Soviets trying to harness the mystical powers of the Orichalcum. Instead, Mr. Lucas' genius revisits the world in the from of the 'Crystal Skull', which gives 'power over the mind' to whoever controls it. Unfortunately Mr. Lucas does not manage to control the minds of his audience, who easily see right through this revolting effort to turn some cheap & easy money from the desperate fan community. No additional effort was put in to come up with an interesting or at least plausible story line. The plot feels like it was designed by Mr. Lucas sometime between lunch and dinner based on some old junk that sprang up for recycling from the back of his mind. It's pitiful and a little bit sad.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
819,planet9,"Not Bad, but fails to deliver like the others",5,30 May 2008,"Harrison Ford returns as Indy in this newest sequel and he is none the worse for wear, but the problem is the movie just somehow disappoints. I went to the theater with four other people and we all agreed something was missing. Maybe it was the slow and tedious storyline. It just did not have the punch I was expecting.Harrison Ford looked and acted fine in the film but it was just so very slow. I agree with many others that the script is at fault. Ford was still quite capable of delivering his usual performance but one can only do so much with an inferior script.The pointless storyline concerning his son took away from the film rather than adding to it. The guy from ""Disturbia"" who played his son has been compared to Marlon Brando, but he is definitely no Brando in any shape, form or fashion. The stupid and irritating ""crotch hitting"" scene involving the son has been done so many times in movies that it is getting pathetic. When, oh when, can we have a movie without someone getting hit or kicked in the crotch? This was cheap and took away from the film.A good point is the return of Karen Allen in the film, and she was perky as always and looking like it was only yesterday that she made the first film. She should have been used a lot more in this film because her presence was a big help. She just simply was not used enough.The film seemed to ""apologize"" for the age of the main players even though they are far from old. When is Hollywood ever going to stop thinking that older players have to be apologized for? They can hold their own and did with what script they had to work with.Anyway, I only tried to fall asleep a couple of times during the movie but for the most part it held my attention although I was not satisfied. All in all the whole thing was too slow, not up to par and did not use the title music we all love nearly enough! What was up with that?

822,raven_1-1,Curiously Un involving,4,27 April 2009,"I loved the previous Indy films; great adventures, acting, dialogue, action and Zest.Unfortunately, this film has none of those qualities, and was so uninvolving that I was bored 20 minutes into the film, mainly because the characters were so dull, stupid or pointless.Dull: Harrison Ford may have felt he was a bit long in the tooth to be playing an adventurer, and toned down Indy accordingly to let other characters take the driving seat. He lacked Zest and was therefore dull. No other actor was strong enough to replace him. Without zest, Indiana Jones lacks one of his major ingredients.Stupid: Shia LaBoef was extremely weak as a 'tough' kid and was completely unbelievable. Waving a flick-knife around and saying ""have you got a problem with that"" was just stupid and boring. Indy should have just punched him in the mouth at their first meeting and been done with it, as he would have done as his old self. There is absolutely no way that he could ever be a successor to Harrison Ford as Indy. Cate would do a much better job.Pointless: Ray Winstone's contribution to the film mainly consisted of shouting out JONESY JONESY at odd intervals. Why was he in the film, what did he contribute? Absolutely nothing - he was just pointless. If he had punched Shia LaBoef a few times he would have had a justifiable reason to be in the film.Dull, Stupid and Pointless: Karen Allen, whom, to be honest, I have never taken to. Never a great actress, she thinks that to be tough she should act like a man - always a sign of a boring and inferior actress - Cate would never make that mistake.Cate was the best of the bunch; Indy should have married her!

824,LinksPopcornPicks,Just as Good as the Originals!,9,8 August 2008,"-After a nineteen year hiatus Indiana Jones is finally back in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". The film stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones of course and brings back Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. The film also stars Shia LaBeouf as the spunky Mutt Williams, Ray Winstone as Indy's old wartime buddy aka Mac, John Hurt as Professor Oxley, and Cate Blanchett as the villainous Russian, Irina Spalko. -The film opens up in Nevada, Area 51.The Russians break in and need a certain item from a warehouse(and I'm talking about, you guessed it, the warehouse!) and only Indy knows the location of the box that the Russians are looking for. As the movie continues, Indy escapes the Russians and eventually meets Mutt Williams. Mutt tells him that the Russians have have kidnapped his mother and his friend, Professor Oxley. Oxley leaves clues about a crystal skull. Indy and Mutt are on their way to the the jungles to find the crystal skull(before the Russians do)and rescue Mutt's mom and Professor Oxley. -Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull begins with Elvis Presly singing ""You Ain't Nothing like a Hound Dog"", which is appropriate considering the 50s atmosphere. When watching this movie, you may think that the entire sci-fi portion may be too out there for Indiana Jones, but being a 50s film its sci-fi B movie theme fits surprisingly well. The film also reminisces the cold war with Indy surviving a nuclear explosion on a testing site by hiding in a lead lined refrigerator. Ridiculous yes, but very cool. They mention ""Colonel"" Henry Jones beating down the Nazis. And now, instead of the Nazis, we have the Soviets looking for the crystal skull to brainwash their enemies. Also the appearances of Marshall College and the old warehouse create a good bridge to the previous films. -The acting was all good. By no means was I disappointed with the acting. Harrison Ford does a great job of bringing back the original attitude and personality of our hero. And with LaBeouf they create a surprisingly wonderful dynamic. Karen Allen is just like the Marion we knew from Raiders and John Hurt as Professor Oxley, while not the most memorable character of the film, plays a pretty good crazy man. Cate Blanchett is not the most ruthless villain of the Indiana Jones series, but plays a very creepy, obsessive, and psychological Russian colonel. -The story revolves around many of the ideas during the 50s such as the cold war(as previously mentioned), the Russians, sitings of UFOs/aliens, and of course lead lined refrigerators. The first half sets up the Russians along with the shout outs to the original films with appearances of the college and warehouse, not to mention pictures Indy's dad, Sean Connery and Marcus Brody. The second delves a little more into the actual crystal skulls as Indiana and Mutt run across the jungles from the soviets. There are some good surprises about the crystal skulls and the second half really sets that up well. -Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a fine entry in the series. Indiana Jones has always been about having a fun adventure with memorable characters. This movie accomplishes just that. A-",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

She thought it was way too hyped and really didn't catch on the nostalgia. Nevertheless, I convinced her to go, telling her that Roger Ebert gave Crystal Skull 3 1/2 star out of 4! Wow! She thought. It's got to be good! Boy were we wrong.

I forced a smile but felt somehow cheated. Am I the main target audience for this movie? Or am I simply too old? Mind you I'm 34. After that followed some cardboard acting by the otherwise great Cate Blanchett and I began to feel bored for real. Then there was some car chases and a really annoying score by John Williams (he did his best work some 20 years ago!)and Shia La Beouf with a Brando outfit...By the time our heroes reached Peru I began to feel embarrassed. Embarrassed for the movie and for tricking my sister into go and see the film. Then it got worse... Over-the-top action sequences and cold CGI sets. Boring actors and flat dialog. I cannot describe my disappointment. The only thing I got out this film was a lesson. To never, ever pay for another Lucas production again. I've felt this way before, with the soul-less Star Wars prequels...But never again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
826,YouSeenThat,There were Capoeira zombies!,1,26 December 2008,"I've always had an established theory about long-running film franchises  when you have run out of ideas, go and set the next bastard in deep space. Friday the 13th did it. Leprechaun did it. Hell, even James Bond did it. Yep, that's right folks, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull almost boldly goes where no fedora-wearing archaeologist has gone before. I say almost. Sure, it's not technically set in space, but some of the concepts are so far out there in the inky blackness of infinity that screenwriter David Koepp probably should have stopped to put down that doobie mid story-arc.Twenty-odd years after the last installment of the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, we pick up the story of the titular Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones (Harrison Ford) toward the end of the nineteen-fifties, 1957 or there about. The long story short is that our whip-crackin' adventurer becomes entangled with a Soviet agent (Cate Blanchett) intent on unraveling the mystery behind a series of unusual artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.Unless you have been living under a rock for the better part of the last two decades, you would have seen at least one or two Indy films. Hell, let me guess, you've probably seen them all and I'm simply preaching to the converted? So I can only assume that the most pressing question from the fan base would be  is this the Indiana Jones you know and love? Hand on heart, I can confirm that this is most definitely an Indiana Jones film through and through. All the camp elements you've come to know and love are there in spades: car chases involving vehicles driving really close alongside one another next to a cliff edge, weak fist fights, swinging like Tarzan from Indy's signature bullwhip, bullets that strike everything but the good guys, the hat, ingenious traps devised by long-extinct cultures, snakes, a female love interest, stereotypical bad guys from behind the Iron Curtain, that travel map plotting Indy's travels from one continent to the next, and yes, that famous theme song. Da da da DA! Da da da! Everything that is Indiana Jones in a nutshell  cross them off your list as you watch the film.Now listen up kids, this is the part where I really have an axe to grind. You take all the stock standard elements of a typical Indy film, the sort of gear that fans eat-up with the proverbial spoon, and then Lucas and company go and ladle in a giant portion of freeze-dried crap. Okay, I'm just going to come out with it, there's no escaping this fact - there is a giant dob of freeze-dried crap floating throughout Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in the form of a fifties sci-fi throwback. I won't spoil it entirely, but don't say that I didn't warn you. Fifties sci-fi has its place, don't get me wrong - just not in Indiana Jones, as far as I'm concerned. I've heard some strong arguments from fans that this sci-fi theme fits in with the Indiana Jones universe, and it's not really that bizarre compared to some of the more out-there elements from previous films, i.e. some priest dude ripping out a beating heart. Judging from the mixed audience and critic reaction, I suspect you are either going to love the sci-fi theme, or more likely, I suspect you are going to hate it with a passion and simply accept nothing less than satisfaction. Love it or hate it, there is no real middle ground to be found.The cinematography and direction were all decent, but then again, cinema-goers wouldn't expect anything less than decent with a budget of $125 million, including veteran director Steven Spielberg at the helm. $125 million clams is at the higher-end of the scale as far as movie budgets go, but nothing completely obscene (I'm looking at you Waterworld)  either way, it's still more than this white-collar schnook would earn in a million lifetimes. If you broke down those production costs, you really have to start to wonder how much they did (or didn't) spend on the CGI. I've got to admit that the CGI is very noticeable in parts, but sadly everything is so heavily-reliant on CGI these days that it's almost impossible to put Pandora back in the box. It's safe to say that lot of memorable scenes from the original Indiana Jones films were shot on, or at least near location, something that appears to be lacking with the latest installment. First and foremost, Indy films are meant to be fun, followed closely by the sense of immersion in the rich and vibrant world created by the director. At points in the film, any real sense of immersion in Indy's world simply gets flushed down the toilet quicker than bags of coke at a Robert Downey Jnr. house party. The film smacks of plastic CGI, the sort of gear that makes a scene look about as authentic as the NASA moon landing.All the elements from the old Indiana Jones films are definitely there, in quantities large enough to give those with fond memories of the fedora-wearing adventurer at least half a proverbial bar. If you're a die-hard Indiana Jones fan, go and see it - don't let a cynical prick like me put you off. Hell, you even get a Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) cameo for good measure. The problem is when you take the stock standard Indy formula and toss in that freeze-dried crap, ala sci-fi, you've probably already lost half of your die-hard Indiana Jones fans in the first ten minutes. If you didn't lose them in the first ten minutes, usually with a lot of coughs that sound like someone muttering the word 'bullshit' into a clenched fist, chances are those last ten chuckle-worthy minutes are going to finish them off like a Mortal Kombat fatality.Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

828,snarf132,great funny and awesome,7,17 June 2010,"I really enjoyed the fourth Indiana Jones movie. it was following the story and had a great cast. the one thing i think they could have done better was ""keeping it a little realistic"". like crawling inside a lead lined fridge and living through it. i think something could have been better than that. but i liked the cast Harrison Ford did a better job then Tom Selleck (original actor of Indiana Jones) would have ever done.And Shia Laboef (transformers) playing as Indys son did a really good job. and one of the best parts was bringing back Karen Allen. i thought she would never come back to movies but she did. however no one thought there was going to be Indiana Jones 4. i liked the movie some of it was a little bit far fetched but hey a good movie. i loved it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
829,willstrong79,Harrison and Steven have done it again,9,24 May 2008,"(bigimagesigns-1) is insane to say that the latest Indy movie was not good. He must be one of those artsy movie types. Listen I feel that the motion picture accomplish what it was set out to do. Indiana Jones has always been about a roller coaster ride of fun and adventure. This newest installment is no exception. The action set pieces are blended nicely into well acted scenes of humor and drama. But what makes this a special gem is Steven Spielberg's gift to capture the feel of Cold War. I think that this particular time period has a lot of relevance to this present. America after the second world war was confused we were unsure of who our friends and foes are and the war heroes of yesteryear were almost forgotten. What alike about this film is that Harrison Ford is Indy. He is the same Indy from Raiders, Temple of Doom, and the Last crusade, he has not change while the world around in 1957 is changing. But we the audience get to yet again thrill at the action and the excitement as Indy travels to exotic place, finds the hidden treasure, gets the girl and looks cool even at 50 doing all of this. This movie is a masterpiece and other movie makers wish they could make family epics like this one. Shia was great as well as Mutt Williams. What is also great is that even with all the special effects wizardry we can do in this day in age Steven did not try to make the movie look and feel very 21st century but he gives us another raiders movie that looks almost like it was made in the 80s. If the Iron Man, Narnia, and now Indy are any indication of how the movies are going to be this summer , than get ready to spend all your allowance money kids this summer is going to be awesome. I only wish this wasn't the last Indy film maybe they make a Saturday animated serial. If the do Bruce Timm of Batman the animated series must direct or create. So come on Indy fans!!! This is definitely a 9 out 10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
830,LawLess38,Great entertainment,8,26 May 2008,"To begin with, we found the movie very entertaining and, just as important, .they had people that can hold the camera still! This made it a joy to watch. Perhaps, this is why so many folks could actually see what is going on around the actors. It is, still, a classic Indy adventure, although not as good as the first one.This one Indy 'shared the movie' more. I would have like it to be more of an 'Indy movie'. Even so, I do appreciate that Spielberg, didn't turn it into another boring chick flick (the way National Treasure 2 did). There were, several, scenes that had us laughing so hard, we didn't notice how long they were.I was disappointed in some of the 'details'. It would have been better if Spielberg had used a real Harley (or Indian). A 'Pan head' would have been better. But, in the age of CG, what do you expect? CG works for Star Wars and Star Trek, it don't really pan out in the real world (no pun intended).The sword fight scene was to stupid to be anything else but comical. Laughed all the way through it. Same with the 'jump' into the river'. The refrigerator had us on our knees, it was so funny. This is typical (ride the periscope across the Mediterranean) Indy.How refreshing not to have to endure the mindless verbiage of over (or under) medicated people. How nice it is not have to endure (and pay to watch) a camera that is hanging off a stick, from a bungee cord. This made up for some of the other short comings.Last, but not least, thank you, Spielberg, for not going into the single mom crap that ruined National Treasure 2! Nothing worse than a bitter old bag. This is a movie that has to be seen on the 'big screen'  unlike most of the 'movies' hollyweed has put out. The ending did suck, no doubt about that. It was vague and left you wondering what the whole 'skull' thing was all about. But..Considering all the crap Hollywood is passing off as movies, these days, this one is good. A pleasure to watch (for a change). This, alone, was worth the price. I go to the cinema to be entertained. This was entertaining. I do not regret the money we paid to see it. If you're looking for historical accuracy, do a search on the internet for your favorite subject.If it is entertainment you're looking for go see this movie. We had a great time with this movie.....Great entertainment!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
831,hairybizrat,Not bad but not as bad as the score,7,10 February 2019,It's a decent movie and not as bad as people say. I see reviews saying it's too unbelievable and the story is poor. Yet these are the same people giving The Temple of Doom a good review. This move is on the same level as The Tenple of the Doom,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
832,Slutmagic2021,A good addition to the series....but some complaints,8,25 May 2008,"Indiana Jones is the coolest character in movies....ever....no question. The first 3 movies are all amazing and timeless so this one had really big shoes to fill.....did it? Well....yeah.....sorta.....THE GOOD: Harrison Ford still kicks ass at 65....if his hair wasn't gray you would think he hadn't aged a bit.Shia Lebuf is awesome as well and he will probably get a lot of hate from people just because....well people are dumbAction Scenes were really great and epic....sometimes ridiculous but who cares?The story was also a high point as always. Really interesting and easy to follow.THE BAD: The CGI....whatever happened to what Spielberg said about LIMITING the use of CGI? I *BEEP* HATE CGI.....almost always, CGI hurts movies rather than helps them and although most of the CGI was good....some is downright awful....like really bad.....like it is dumbfounding.Actually that is really the only thing I can think of worth mentioning thats bad about this movie...for real...I mean you could complain it is UNREALISTIC in which case I would call you a moron and tell you to stop watching movies because movies are not supposed to be realistic....but whateverBOTTOM LINE: A great movie....yeah the other 3 are better but still, this one is great entertainment for everyone who does not have a stick firmly lodged in their ass.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

834,kermitthefrog594,Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - Not the Phantom Menace,10,23 May 2008,"Of course it was never going to be as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Are you crazy? It was refreshing to see George Lucas and Steven Spielberg take a different, more B-movie approach to the film. John Hurt was a good addition to the cast. Ray Winstone's character seemed like an attempt at the new Belloq, but was far from my favourite. Shia LeBeouf tried admirably, and succeeded in not being the ne Short Round. The action scenes were well done (though they could have had a better creepy crawly than ants), the exposition integrated well, and the humor a light touch. While Karen Allen should have got more screen time, and the romantic scene that ends the movie seems slightly out of character for Indy, this movie is easily the best of 2008.I encourage everyone to see it right away.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
835,clouded_eye,A Good Continuation of the Series,7,24 May 2008,"This comment is directed at all the naysayers of this movie... I don't understand all the negativity surrounding it. I enjoyed it immensely. Was it the best movie of the series? (Raiders=10, Temple=7, Crusade=9) Definitely not. Was it the best movie of the summer? With Iron Man being so good and movies like The Dark Knight and Hellboy 2 still to come, probably not. But it was good.Let me first address the alien issue... I think it fit well with the original series. I mean, come on, it's just as believable as the bases of the original three. Christianity and Hinduism are just about as factual as ancient Native American religions; even those involving aliens. Who cares what the religion surrounding the stories are as long as the main themes and characters remain the same? Keep in mind that the movie takes place in the late 1950s which is when the huge interest in Science Fiction and aliens hit America hard core. It not only makes for an entertaining romp, it is completely relevant to the time period.About the movie being formulaic... To state the obvious, Indiana Jones movies are about an archaeologist dropped into the middle of adventures that involve a supernatural twist. That's the formula. For Lucas and Spielberg not to adhere to this formula would have made the movie something completely different. This movie was formulaic, but so are all the others.My only real complaints with the movie are the casting of Shia LeBeouf and that they were unable to convince Sean Connery to come out of retirement. Sean Connery would have only enhanced the picture, and casting someone other than Shia LeBeouf would have been a good call on the part of the Lucas/Spielberg machine. I don't know what it is about that kid, but I just don't like him all that much. For some reason, he seems to keep getting parts in movies I want to watch.Harrison Ford was great as usual, but what else can you expect from a man who's only made 3-4 bad movies in his 35+ year career? The reintroduction of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood was great! She is still beautiful after all this time and was just as funny as she was in Raiders. Kate Blanchett is almost always great. John Hurt has been a favorite of mine since I first saw The Elephant Man and he did not disappoint. Ray Winstone was up to his usual good standards and made a memorable character out of a part that could have been played by anyone.In summary, I liked this movie a lot and, while the specifics might be a little different from the original trilogy, the overall theme is the same. Definitely worth the ticket price and I will surely be getting the DVD when it's released and placing right next to the other three.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
836,Hurr78,"Not Raiders Redux,but a worthy return",7,22 May 2008,"There were times in this film where I cringed, because Lucas and Spielberg ask the audience to suspend their disbelief one big step beyond anything that was asked of them in the previous three films. But on the other hand, those films were a collective homage to a different kind of adventure serial. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an homage to B grade Sci-fi movies of the 1950s. When you keep that in mind, the cringing goes away a bit... and when you REALLY think about it, you wonder why they didn't take it a step even further in that direction than they already have.But I digress. On the whole, this is a very entertaining film, and contains one extended action sequence that is truly on a par with the best of the first three movies. Cate Blanchett is an effective enough villain, although perhaps not as memorable as Belloq and his henchmen from Raiders. The supporting players (Winstone, Broadbent, and John Hurt) all do a fine job of the roles they've been assigned. And it's nice to see Karen Allen back again, even though she's a bit rusty in terms of the acting skills.Still, Marian and Indy do give the film some of its best dialogue. I understand that Lawrence Kasdan was consulted on some of the more ""romantic"" scenes in the film, and I think it shows. There is one scene in particular, that I won't get more specific about here, that really brings back the magic of the Marian-Indy banter from Raiders, if only for a few short moments.And then there's Shia and his character Mutt. I was ready to hate this character, but really, he didn't bother me.Anyhow, enough said. If you're looking for a good movie to have a enjoyable summer night at the movies, this one will do the trick. I think most of you will be glad you did.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
837,nasakcuf-3,"Not quite the same Dr. Jones I remember, but still excellent",8,25 May 2008,"At 40 now, I grew up with the entire series back in the 80s and enjoyed every minute I spent watching Jones' matinée-like escapades. It would seem however that the concept is now wearing a bit thin, too many instances of ""hey wait a minute, how can THAT be...?"" But then again, I'm not a teenager anymore, and have watched many a movie with more plausible but equally harrowing escapes...I think the key to enjoying this movie is to suspend your belief long enough to sit through it. If you do that, I think you will find this offering to be well worth your time.Dr. Jones is after another artifact this time around, but there are no Nazis to get in the way; the communists have that honor, and are after the same artifact that Dr. Jones is. If you've watched previous Indy movies you can already envision how this one goes down (plenty of fisticuffs and harrowing escapes), however the ending is QUITE different (and in my view, spectacular). After mulling the movie over in my mind in the context of the ending, perhaps this is what I don't like about the movie: Indy appears to be entering a more modern era (the movie is set in 1957) and because of this it seems to lose a certain something. Unlike other posters here I didn't find the script or dialog faulty, and I especially liked the stunts, which were actually quite breathtaking in places.In the end, this is a movie you'll probably want to see, if for no other reason than to round out your viewing of the quadrology(?) If you do I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, but I suspect few people will give it a second viewing. Overall I give it 8/10, which is what I usually give movies where the entertainment received covers the price of admission; your mileage, on the other hand, may vary.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
838,jokersonyou,Huge Disappointment,1,22 May 2008,"Indy 4 is likely the biggest disappointment for me in the last 10 years. I didn't like Die Hard 4 (it took an R rated action series and tuned in a PG generation), T3 was passable but hammed up the series, Alien 4 saw sex between Ripley and the alien, Spider-Man 3 turned into camp, and Indy 4 is likely the worst of them all. It strays so far from its roots that it seems like a parody of an Indy film moreso than a sequel to its classic ancestry.I even have to line by line write what's wrong with this film because it's laughably bad:-Mutt showing up ala Brando made me laugh. Corny to the nth degree. -Mutt swinging on vines at 160km/h with monkeys? -So many allusions to other films (two of The Fugitive, Superman, Wild Bunch, Spider-Man, etc). -Indy survives a nuclear bomb in a fridge. -Ridiculous hedgehogs for the first 10 minutes. -Let's drive this jeep off the cliff and aim for that tree. Then, as if that wasn't unbelievable enough, go down 3 waterfalls in a jeep, and all 4 passengers stay in the jeep until the end. -Marion has absolutely ZERO edge compared to Raiders. -Reliance on CGI. This has Lucas written all over it but the greatness of the first 3 were physical stunts. -Worst Cate Blanchett performance of her career. It's pretty bad when her accent comes and goes and they let it slip. -Aliens? Indiana Jones is about artifacts and history, not alien life forms using a UFO to escape Earth to another dimension.The first 10 minutes of this movie destroyed any excitement I had. It was amongst the worst 10 opening minutes of a film I have EVER seen, and I am a Film/Media BA. I can't get over how bad it was. The first 10 minutes in every Indy film (or Bond for that matter) open with a stunt or action that doesn't necessarily relate to the rest of the story. What do we get here? Hedgehogs, a nuclear bomb, Shia playing dressup, and I can't go on. What a disappointment. From a lifelong Indy fan.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
839,greg-253,I've got a bad feeling about this.....,2,22 May 2008,"Like the man said....you're right to have a bad feeling.What can I say? Very disappointing and tedious are a couple words that come to mind. While you can't blame George and Steven for going back to the Indy well, you have to wonder why they couldn't come up with a better, more believable, and well-written premise.One of the things I enjoyed most about ""Raiders"" was how crisp and fun the writing/delivery was. Also, Indiana Jones wasn't superhuman and most of the action was believable. Not so, in this latest incarnation. I won't go down the list of WTF issues here, other than to say that when the bomb drops - it's just the beginning.I saw ""Raiders"" in the theater 13 times when it first came out. Sad to say, I won't be watching this one again....even on DVD.Selah, Indy (George and Steven)....it's time to hang up the hat.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
840,bgalligan,"If you like sci fi blended with your favorite action hero, you'll love it. I didn't.",6,25 May 2008,"I wanted to love this movie, I really did. Raiders is my all time favorite film. I saw it at age 18 and knew nothing about that film going in. Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade were solid entertainment as well. Maybe you just can't recapture the magic of a movie set in the 30s. That period of our history has an innocence already built in. Maybe my expectations were too high. The 50s isn't the same time frame as the other Indy flicks. That fact alone is going to color the film differently. The beginning is alright. Ford seems to take a while to get back into the fedora wearing feel of Indy. He's a bit wooden at the start, or is it weariness? The CGI generated gophers irritated the crap out of me. Those small scenes would have worked so much better had they been actual gophers. I wish filmmakers would quite using CGI to save a buck. Are they actually saving a buck? It can't cost that much to film live gophers coming out of a hole. Just because you can do CGI doesn't mean you should. CGI critters usually annoy me though...fake, fake, fake!! Not that this is a realistic movie. Some scenes are just waaaay over the top, even for an Indy film. Indy survives an atomic blast. Come on!! Too much sci fi, not enough character. Marion is introduced and she isn't given much to do. There doesn't seem to be much chemistry between Ford and Allen. Indy doesn't do as much as he used to physically. I wanted less Mutt, more Indy. Did Lucas write this to simply set up LeBeuf for another younger Indy franchise? Harrison Ford is the only Indy for me. The traitor/friend character is just a plot device, who calls Indy Jonesy way too many times. I appreciated the homages to the other Indy films, a glimpse of the Ark, the opening gopher mound (minus the gopher coming out of it), almost identical shot of Indy being chased by natives. Oh, it's an okay movie, but I wanted more character and smarter dialogue. Where's the Indy wit? Everybody seemed to be going through the motions. I missed the rousing score too. I think the Indy theme played once during the whole film. Was John Williams asleep too? I have a feeling George Lucas had too much input. He wanted the alien angle and it hurts the film. The Indy/alien blend doesn't work for me, it might for you. I would have preferred Frank Darabont's script.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
841,HoBopkins,Ind E. Coyote,1,2 June 2008,"This is one of the worst films ever made. There are people defending this mess saying that ""Temple of Doom"" was just as bad. I agree to a certain aspect; ""Temple of Doom"" was a horrible, horrible film, but there was still some inkling of magic left, if merely residue from ""Raiders"", who knows, but I felt that I was in another place, another time, sharing in an adventure that just wasn't that good of an adventure. But this film had no magic at all. Other than the now infamous fridge being thrust from a nuclear explosion over the villain's car and onto a place that happens to be safe enough to not be affected by the blast, there are many aspects of this film that made it sub-par for the sub-mental. The ""Skull"" itself looked as if it were made by Toys R Us. The dialog between Karen Allen and Harrison Ford was so forced and contrived and the acting was like something from a kid's television show, or worse. The plot involving aliens was very weak, and Indy and company traveled from place to place like one would go on a scavenger hunt. There is a scene where monkeys aid Indy's son in attacking Russians that almost equal the fridge; and a host of CGI ants that look so computer animated I felt like I was playing a video game. The bottom line is magic; good or bad, there just wasn't any in this movie. It was horrible, simply horrible. It was like watching a cartoon where Indy just couldn't die, no matter what happened to him. I half expected him to pull out an ""ACME"" manual and to drop the skull and start searching for The Road Runner.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
842,standish77,A welcome return of the classic hero,8,22 May 2008,"To all those guys out there who have panned the latest Indiana Jones film...you are ALL SO wrong!!! Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not a perfect movie, by any means...but it's a damn sight better than any of the most recent Hollywood blockbusters (The Mummy, Spiderman, Superman Returns, etc).The movie begins with the classic Paramount logo and from that moment on you realise you are watching something different...something special. This looks and feels exactly like the other Indy movies. Kudos to Spielberg for capturing the 1950's era spot on. There has been criticism over the OTT factors of the film; especially the fridge scene. Yet I thought this was an incredibly fun scene that does work. Indiana Jones has always been about pure-escapism fun...and in all the previous movies there have been OTT scenes (how about the time when Indy jumps out of a plane in a boat? Or almost has his heart ripped out?). The series was never rocket science...it was just about being good, old, unadulterated fun...it always has been...and thankfully with the latest installment it still is! Harrison Ford is on top of form...and the humour is just right. Most of the action scenes work and the partnership between Indy and Mutt is solid and at times entertaining.The criticism (if any) lies in the middle part of the movie (set in Peru) where the story does go a little flat. There is also a little too much CGI (though I do argue that the ants looked great)...it was just the jungle chase that was too blue screen for me.As for all you who hated the alien story-line...you're forgetting something. The 1950's were all about science-fiction and martians. So whilst the original 3 films are a homage to the 1930's adventure movies...this is a homage to those 1950's B-movies.So all in all...whilst not perfect...this is still great cinema...and is highly-recommended! At the moment I will put it between The Last Crusade and The Temple of Doom in order of my favourite Indy films. And that is no bad thing!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

In temple of doom you have 3 characters through the whole movie,(indy,the girl and the kid) all of them interesting except the cliche girl but they were the only interesting characters.but in skull you have shia lebouf an inspired kid wity smarts rivaling indys and mary returns to but with slight less character,john hurt is cool as shia's father figure in his times of confusion who is in fear of losing his mentors mind,and more.theres more chacter building too.Also the action though not as practical as prior but was more exspansive with crazy stunts and crazy sets. Yes the fridge is a bit silly.And yes aliens are over the top.but this series shows voodoo,gods wrath of the covenent and the holy grails immortal power,so hows a largley accepted theory utter stupid? Its a good film and i liked it",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
844,ToLiveAndDieInMA,A letdown,5,29 June 2008,"I was skeptical on seeing this,but when it started, I enjoyed it. Then we got into a plot involving mind control and creepy ruin guards. The plot at first seems OK, but when it gets to CGI...ugh.Unlike the first 3, this films lacks convincing stunts, or a sense of wonder.The two car chases are excused but Harrison dose not seem a bit interested in providing a convincing Indiana Jones. He kinda sleepwalks like he usually dose in interviews. Now the age thing doesn't bother me much. The kinda poke fun at it too. Sort of like Sean Connery did as James Bond in ""Never Say Never Again"". I give it a 5 out of 10 for starting good, and drilling it into the ground. It might make a fun rental, but nothing to get excited about.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
845,blippster,Unjustly criticised,7,27 November 2008,"Now first of all, it isn't hard to see where the criticism comes from. When I walked out of the cinema, I was thinking ""WTF had I just seen?"". I had been expecting another Raiders of the Lost Ark, and instead got something more like National Treasure.I was wary about giving the movie a second shot, but considering I wasn't paying, I decided to go ahead and rent it. It improved tenfold that second time I saw it. This time I was not expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark, I was expecting National Treasure, and I got something better! Harrison Ford is still the same after nineteen years. If there's any fear that 60-yr-old Indy wont be the same, they are unfounded. True he is cleverer, and wiser, and no longer a chauvinist, but it all fits in nicely.This is about the only thing I like Shia LaDouche in. He seems to really be in his element, and his character is very likable. To be honest with you, I don't like the return of Karen Allen after all these years; she I felt was one of the weakest characters in the piece, but we do have the pleasant additions of Cate Blanchett and Ray Winstone.The CGI brings the movie down a little. It is used even when it is far from necessary. That being said, it is not as bad as the usage in the Star Wars prequels, but Georgie Boy has to learn that just because he can use CGI, doesn't mean its necessarily a good thing.I enjoyed the story; I felt it was actually a better story than Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The aliens at the end were quite unnecessary and about as far from Raiders of the Lost Ark as one can get, but for the most part the story was solid. The action scenes are as good as they have been in all the movies, but sometimes they do stretch our disbelief too far.So a word of advice: Don't go into the theatre expecting another Raiders of the Lost Ark. Don't go in expecting something that fits in perfectly with the original trilogy. Try to judge the movie for what it is, not what its predecessors were.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Have people actually seen this film or are they just liking the sound of their own voices? I am in the Cinema business so am fortunate enough to be seeing this tonight...I am looking forward to it so much and I am positive that it will not disappoint :-) I am no critic! (the reason I am no critic is because I am of the firm opinion that most films are not BAD or GOOD...it is perceptive!) And this goes for Indy. Point is that if you are an 80s throw back like me who loved these adventures then go to the cinema and enjoy! I certainly will be!Don't get hung up on the fact its not as good as Raiders or its almost as good as Last Cruisade..just kick back and go on the adventure! :-),Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
847,PapaT_86,Little bang and not worth the buck.,4,19 August 2008,"I guess no one is going to read this. As of this writing there are 1719 reviews for this in the User Comments section already. But I think I might be able to offer something some of the other reviews might not; conciseness. I think the problem with the movie is actually very simple. By now anyone who hasn't seen the film will still have heard the most common complaints; weak CGI, implausible escapes from nuclear danger, a Tarzan imitation, the introduction of elements arguably inappropriate for an Indy movie, irritating characters and so forth. I think a bigger problem is that the movie is generally unexciting and mostly downright BORING! The first two movies had enough action in their first scenes for a whole movie. The opening of this movie is lethargic and unengaging, and the remainder of the film rarely rises above it. The much maligned ""Nuke the Fridge"" scene is actually one of the better moments of the movie because it is at least amusing! The issue isn't so much that the film isn't worthy of the Indiana Jones name, it's more that it isn't worth the ticket price.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
848,ywfb93,Wow They Got Lazy,6,4 June 2008,"This movie was possibly the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. It actually wasn't ""that"" bad of a movie, but you'd just expect more from them. Almost every action movie has plot holes and random things that aren't explained, but your forgive it anyway because it's just an action movie, but there were many things in this movie that I couldn't forgive. For instance, the whole alien plot was ridiculous, Marion almost immediately fell back in love with Indi, and a lot more that I just can't remember at the moment. But there was one thing in this movie I can never in a million years forgive, and that was Mutt getting tangled in the vines with the monkeys, and all of the sudden he knows how to swing on the vines like Tarzan. It was stupid, irrelevant, and incredibly non-realistic. I know it's a movie that's not meant to be believable, but movies are supposed to have the feeling that if you were in that situation that's what would happen. And one more thing I didn't like was Mutt ending up as Indi's son. It gave a different, more boring feel to their relationship. Before they knew they were father and son, it seemed fun and entertaining, kind of like two friends having an adventure. Then when they discovered they were father and son their relationship got boring and plain. I know I've done a lot of complaining about this movie, so I'm going to tell you what I did like about this movie so I don't seem like a whiny b*tch. This movie had terrific action scenes, which made this movie a terrific thrill ride. Cate Blanchett did a great job as Irina Spalko, she was beautiful, and a great choice for the part. Ray Winstone did a good job as well, because in the movie, he kept helping the bad guys and f*cking Indi over, he made you frustrated. Harrison Ford was of course great as usual, as was Karen Allen. But the true star of the movie, the character that all the little kids want to be when they play Indiana Jones with their little friends, Shia LeBouf. He does great in every movie he is in, but in this movie he does even better. He is funny, entertaining, and is believable as the slightly soft kid pretending to be tough. The whole alien plot was a bit much, but had a great moral at the end, the true treasure was knowledge, I thought that was great. Over all I give this movie a 6 because besides all of the flaws, the movie did it's job by entertaining us with action scenes and special effects. But even doing that, it should've been better. But hey, it beats watching ""Sex and the City.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Yes I realize they're supposed to be campy/cheesy adventure romps, and unlike National Treasure (both of 'em), which I knew were gonna be mindless- crap entertainment, Indy 4 completely forgot about the entertainment part.To help you save your money and keep it out of the producers pocket, I'll give you the simple breakdown of Indy 4, which may just be more entertaining the actual movie and with better dialog................Spoilers Ahead...............Say hello to the good ol' U.S. of A circa ""Red Scare"" 50s. Say hello to Indy's hat and Harry Ford, who is four-pack shy of 70 years old. Sorry Harry, but your getting a little old to swing across a warehouse, slam back first into a truck windshield, make witty anecdote, and get back to the swashbuckling without a scratch... say hello to the new Indy sidekick, the evil commie chick and the alien corpse. Guess what time it is? It's sidekick double cross time followed by the obligatory truck/warehouse chase scene (note: 184,000 bullets are fired in this scene and only one toe was victimized)... hey look, there's the Ark! Did you catch that? Yeah I totally saw it!... brawl with big/evil commie dude... rocket sled ride (definitely an ""e"" ticket)... cool nuclear explosion... flying Indy fridge... cute groundhog critter... Indy gets a shower... Indy the secret spy agent? Makes prefect sense to me too. Isn't every archaeologist a spy in their off time?Back to teaching at the university... Doh!, cancel that, Indy just got fired... time to pack for new adventures... reminiscing about the good old' days (yeah, like Indy 1-3)... hey it's the kid from Transformers, nice motorcycle! Topics for today: crystal skulls, the ""Ox"", and some silly city of gold... dude, I totally think the Transformers kid, is Indy's son. Nod to American Graffiti and we're off to the next chase scene, motorcycle style!... ""hilarious"" Marcus Brody statue comedy gag... ""you wanna be a good archaeologist you gotta get outta the library!""Dude, cue the map scene 'cause we're outta here...

""Ox""... side note: you know those (bleep)ing short versions of movies you find Youtube? Well, there will be ""the Ox short version"" of Indy 4 soon enough... oh no, quicksand!... an Indy/snake gag would be funny right now and look, there it is. It's family group therapy hour (Jerry, Jerry, Jerry)... now back to our regularly scheduled chase scene... who wants to play the hot potato skull game or perhaps fencing for idiots, with premature ejaculation insults. No really, it's totally fun... then we have bullets, punching, and ball whacking with plants... monkeys, and the Transformer's kid doing Tarzan impressions. Brilliant, next.

850,TBear6000,Fantastic Film,10,22 May 2008,"Anytime an attempt is made to go back and add on to something as iconic as the Indiana Jones trilogy it runs the risk of falling short of expectations and, by relation, sullying the original work. However, this was far from the case with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Remarkably, it also avoided the trap of being nothing more than a shameless collection of throwbacks to the original series. While an occasional mention is made of past characters, this film tells a story all its own - an engaging one at that. It was a fantastic film, riveting from start to finish, and entirely worthy of standing alongside the others. While Raiders of the Lost Ark will always remain my favorite, I actually enjoyed this new entry as much, if not more, than the other two. I highly recommend the film to any Indiana Jones fan.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
851,nuclearsnow,Not as good as Raiders but Better than Temple,8,26 May 2008,"I know I heard a lot of negative feedback do to the nature of what Indy is involved with in this adventure, instead of a historic religious artifact such as the Ark or the Holy Grale, this involves (spoiler).......................some alien like influence.I can go with the period this was set in, the 1950's, during that time aliens and UFO fever was high, the McCarthy era where everyone was a commie traitor, and low anyone be accused of being a red and the Roswell crash, which is all in the movie, a lot is focused on the Crystal Skull (not the actual one), which some have said was carved by aliens, along with other alien theories such as the Aztecs,Myans and Egytians being so close in their culture, pyramids etc, that some believe was aliens at work, also the famous Nazca lines. All these factor into the film, and of course Indy being a scientist and a archaeologist looks at this not as aliens but as human artifacts as scientist do, even with proof mounting about the origins, he still doesn't buy it and this comes off well in the movie as how Indy would react.I also enjoyed seeing Indy post WW2, we only caught a glimpse of this in the TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, where Harrison Ford made a cameo in a episode, which by the cars, took place sometime in the 1950's as well, also a reference to the series was made in the movie where Indy learned the language, he told Mutt he was kidnapped by Pancho Villa, which was the first episode of the series. And this featured the return of Marion Ravenwood, who most thought was the best of the Indys girls in the trilogy.All in all this was a good Indy outing in my opinion, and a good send off for the character, you can get the sense that Indy is on the verge of retirement from the adventuring, and the conclusion to his story, a good summer film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
852,Pulpmariachi,Unaffected by Mileage,8,22 May 2008,"Nineteen years ago, when we last left Indiana Jones, he was riding off into the sunset, just having discovered and lost the Holy Grail, his father and his friends at his side. Over two years ago, when we last left Steven Spielberg, he had delivered quite possibly his bleakest, most depressing, and bitter movie to date. Prior to that, there were numerous rumors that the two would cross paths again. Yet, after attempts by numerous screenwriters, we have Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Needless to say, expectations rose high; this is, after all, Indiana Jones, one of the greatest adventure heroes. Excitement ran through the wires of the Internet and through word of mouth, but there was so much that could wrong at the same time: Harrison Ford is well into his 60s; George Lucas continues on shelling out Star Wars movies, barely making them beyond mediocre; Spielberg isn't the same filmmaker he once was, if his recent crop of movies from Schindler's List onward proves, he's taken a much darker turn and that whimsy and fascination and sense of fun that permeated Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET: The Extra-Terrestrial, and Raiders of the Lost Ark has pretty much vanished. Added with the state of movie audiences in this day and age, who are far more cynical and pessimistic (a result of current policies and administrations?), there was a lot of potential for the fourth outing of Indiana Jones to fail.But it didn't.No: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a solid adventure picture, a border between the pulp-dime-novel-cliffhangers of the original trilogy and the weird sci-fi horrors from the 50s and 60s. Within five minutes after the start (ignore those prairie dogs), Spielberg has effectively and almost seamlessly taken us back into the world of the greatest daredevil archaeologist. His silhouette appears on the side of cars, his icon hat hardly ever leaves his head, and his wit is a strong as ever. Within twenty minutes, you're cheering for him all over again as he shows the Russians that he's not someone who can be easily stepped over.The plot isn't any more complicated than any of the other films: there's these bad guys who wish to obtain a supernatural artifact to further their cause and Indiana Jones must stop them. Story revolving around the crystal skull itself can get a little complicated, the Meso-American importance and such, but the plot leaves enough room for car chases through a University, investigation of an ancient cemetery, another chase through the jungle (complete with sword-fighting on the back of cars), and all the booby traps that adorn mythical landscapes that's come to be expected out of this. As always, the chases are heart-pounding and it's always fun to watch Jones figure out what he's going to do next. Take out a forest cutter with a rocket launcher? Why not. Escape a warehouse using whips to swing himself from the overhead lights? That might work. Hide in a refrigerator to escape a nuclear blast? Better than any other idea. It's how Indiana Jones roles and if you have a problem with that, you're in the wrong movie, buddy.There's no denying that Harrison Ford seems to be able to turn the Indiana Jones role on and off and it's a quite welcome decision that no one decided to pull a Bond and replace him. Shia LeBeouf proves himself to be making the right decisions and he's one of the least annoying sidekicks in the franchise (I'm looking at you, Short Round). Karen Allen returns, one of the best choices anyone could have made, and she again takes one of the most well-developed and realized love interests in any movie series through her same able-to-hold-her-own/Help-me-Indy/I-can-handle-this-myself role that makes up the dear Marion Ravenwood. Ray Winstone, always creepy, is an excellent foil and Cate Blanchett provides one of the creepiest  maybe the most intelligent  villains in the series so far. They're having fun in their roles, they're here for the ride, the thrill, the sense of being back together (Ford and Allen at least), of just doing something because they wanted to, and that chemistry and excitement moves off the screen.Spielberg again proves just how much of the greatest director he is, able to come off the human psyche examination that was Munich to this without any hitch. He can stage an action sequence, avoiding the quick-cutting, kinetic, in-your-face, CGI-camera, epic sweeping cinematography choices that so many others have chosen, instead letting the shots last longer, resuming his point-and-shoot, non-meticulous-looking style prominent in the earlier films. Jansuz Kaminski delivers his most non-Kaminski photography yet; though there's still more desaturated lighting and beams through smoke than the other films.The film's weakest point comes in the CGI, though there's minimal use of it. The prairie dogs at the beginning are too cute and out-of-place; swinging Tarzan monkeys don't seem to come across as well as they were when they were written; and the ending does kind of have a tacky element about it, but that might be the genre that the film's flirting with. And a tree of smoke with Indiana Jones standing beneath almost stretches the film's own reality too far, though it does make for a good screen-shot.Roger Ebert said it the best: ""If you like the Indiana Jones movies, you'll like this one."" And it's true. So how does it compare? The safest way to view it, I think, is not to compare it to Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is so perfect that nothing can stand up to it. I'd say, compare it to the weakest entry, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and see how it goes there. It's still early to weigh in its place within the franchise, but it's still one great, one spectacularly fun ride.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
853,daisybtoes,Keeping Up With the Joneses,8,26 June 2008,"I enjoyed this film. I enjoy all of the Indiana Jones films. I even Temple of Doom, which has long been my favorite for reasons unknown, though Raisers and Crusade are probably ""better"" films.And so it is with Crystal Skull. It is full of clichés, like all other Indy films, and full of self-parody and fantastically impossible stunts. It may not be Raisers of Crusade, but it is still Indy and though it made me feel old watching it, it was comfortable to watch for the following reasons: 1. Indy teaches in a tiny classroom, but on a large campus. This is the first time we actually get to see it. Indy's house looks more comfortable and ""lived in"" than it did in the earlier films, which adds nice realism and passage of time.2. Loose threads are tied together with old characters. We learn that Henry Sr. and Marcus Brodie have passed on, and that Abner Ravenwood, Oxley, Brodie and Stanforth were all part of the University archaeological faculty. One must ask if adventurous digs and escapades is what they did on summer breaks. Realism and fantasy do co-exist.3. Indy has aged well. He is clearly in his 60's, and he is more settled in his scenes, leaving most of the hard stuff to Mutt. I found myself not only feeling old, but noticing how much Indy was starting to look, sound, and act like his father. This was a nice touch, actually, and I was pleased to see that he and Marion finally tied the knot. Nice final scene - the semi-magical hat blows mysteriously through the church door and blows toward Mutt, but it is Indy who picks it up and wears it, with a look on his face that says, ""Someday, kid - but not yet."" The only thing that really bothered me about the film was the supporting cast of Soviets. I can understand the ease in which they broke into the testing site because it had been deliberately cleared of all but gate guards. What I couldn't understand was Soviets in stolen vehicles chasing madly after Indy and Mutt all across the University Campus. I know, I know...that's a movie cliché in itself: Gangs of Bad Guys always chase and shot at the hero in very public places, but it is a pet peeve of mine.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
854,glasgow1873,Fantastic and a reminder of what we have been missing......,9,23 May 2008,"**SPOILERS** I love Indiana Jones films...I was terrified of not liking this after reading some of the comments on here. Im happy to say that it did not disappoint, at all...The film starts off well, plenty of action, to be honest at the start I wasn't convinced that Ford still had that Indy sparkle, but as the movie went on it became clear he did. Im not here to breakdown the film but I liked Shia LeBeouf, I thought the second act (when Blatchett firsts kidnaps Indy) dragged a little, I loved the over the top action (CGI) and also the classic old fashioned stunts (with the jungle chase outstanding). The story was interesting and kept me hooked. I have a theory about this - I think that a lot of people are freaked by the whole Alien story line. I have been interested in the Mayan, Peru link to so called Aliens for a while now so the premise (pardon the pun) was not really Alien to me. I saw the link and enjoyed it thoroughly but I think this would put off a lot of people who haven't heard of this Erik Von danikken conspiracy/god theory. Don't let it ruin the film for you, take it for what its worth. It has the stunts (as good as any Indy film) it has the sparkle (Mary-Ann, Indy and Shia all go well) it has the charm, dialogue and perfect ingredients that make a good Indiana Jones film. The story may be a little out there, but just because its not as well known as the Ark or the Holy Grail doesn't mean it ain't great. The only downside is that it makes you a little sad they didn't do another Indiana Jones Trilogy in the 90's. Im going to miss him when he is gone, a lot........I like this but not quite as much as Crusade, just behind Raiders (of course) and ahead of Temple.....but hey, they are all great.9/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
855,Diplodocus55,"Boo! Shame on you, Spielberg & Co.",3,22 May 2008,"Spielberg has had his share of flat-out bad movies (THE TERMINAL, THE LOST WORLD), but couldn't he have spaced it out so that his next bad film was something other than his return to Indiana Jones? I read some early negative reviews and felt they were probably being too mean-spirited, but upon sitting through Indy 4 I believe those critics weren't negative enough! This is an awful installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, lacking in any sort of magic or even the slightest bit of fun. It really does seem like a mere cash grab for all involved. Spielberg, probably smarting from his box office flop MUNICH, wanted to get his mojo back by raking in the inevitable several hundred million from this film. But jeez, couldn't he have least TRIED to capture that ol' Indy magic? The entirety of the movie I was sitting there waiting for the film to start. No one wanted this movie to rock more than me. Indy was the hero of my childhood, and I consider RAIDERS a rare masterpiece. I think DOOM is one of the most exciting movies around, and although I feel CRUSADE is weak, I still have seen it dozens of times out of sheer principle. But what... was... this?! Indy 4 seemed like a fan-made movie with a Harrison Ford look-alike. Everything about it was sub-par, and IMO there wasn't ONE GREAT SCENE! I dislike CRUSADE, but at least it had a few wonderful moments. Spielberg claimed he wanted to get the feel of the old Indy movies by not shooting digital, doing a lot of stunts over CGI, and not using his newer, more evolved style as seen in say, MINORITY REPORT or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. I appreciate that, but why didn't he go all the way, especially in the most significant areas? First of all, the grotesque creatures bit in this film (ants) were CGI! After having the biggest gathering of snakes, insects and rats ever assembled to film in the 1st three movies, Spielberg takes the waaaaay lazy route and uses animated ants, which move toward their victims like a storm cloud as they would in any Sat. morning cartoon. If I'm not mistaken, even what the Paramont logo morphs into was CGI! What happened to you, Steven?On top of that, there was just no engaging action scenes (really only 4 sequences -- brawl in Area 51 warehouse, motorcycle chase on Indy's campus, then after a looooooooooooooong gap, a jungle jeep chase, and then finally the escape-as-the-kingdom-collapses-all-around-you scene). In RAIDERS there were 8 action set pieces, one per every 15 minutes (idol in beginning, bar fight, marketplace fight, snake and mummy pit, airstrip fight, truck chase, battleship, opening the Ark). Raiders flowed so well you were not conscious of it. This film had long stretches of excruciating talking and gabbing. All for all the talky exposition about the crystal skulls, I still had no idea their history or significance.Another strikingly awful thing about this film was it's reliance on very silly, cheesy humor, way worse than THE LAST CRUSADE. There were cringe-inducing moments from start to finish. One example comes to mind was when in the midst of a chase scene, Mac (Ray Winstone) seemed to break character, throw his arms up and cry gleefully to the guy he has betrayed over and over: ""Jonsey!"" (in probably an ode to the Tuco character in THE GOOD, THE BAD & THE UGLY, who would call Eastwood ""Blondie""). Shia Lebeouf is not the problem -- in fact, by the end of the film I felt sorry for him this was what his Indy movie turned out to be (he probably felt the same massive disappointment Natalie Portman probably felt when her (1st) Star Wars movie turned out to be PHANTOM MENACE).For what it's worth, here are some of the references to the original films I detected: *Indy saying ""Intolerable"" when Mutt got him into trouble (what Connery used to say in Indy 3). *Indy calling the crystal skull myth a ""bedtime story"", just as he did about the grail in Indy 3. *The Ark exposed through its crate in the warehouse. *Marcus Brody statue (decapitated, no less!) *Cheesy camera push in on Sean Connery production still from Indy 3. *Indy marries that girl from Raiders (Mutt could have been conceived on that battleship). *Wilhelm scream brought to you by nerd in library (might have occurred again later) *No Willie Scott, no Short Round, no Sallah, no guy on motorcycle with eyepatch and Nazi monkey.Anyway, I hated this movie. I give it a 3 only for the good intentions I hope the director had when he set out to make this. What a let down! Even the bigger long-awaited disappointment than PHANTOM MENACE -- seriously! Boo, Spielberg! Boo! I expected this sort of thing from Lucas, but not from you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Picture George Lucas (credited as sole writer for this fiasco) sitting at his computer/typewriter at 2am faced with a particular dilemma. Mmmm...let's see, the hero and his posse are racing through the jungle in vehicles with the bad guys and gals in hot pursuit when suddenly the younger supporting character gets separated from the others by being thrown into a tree full of monkeys. Question: how and the heck do I get him back to the main group? (Takes a sip of brandy along with a handful of Geritol) Wait, I know, he'll simply swing along the vines with the chimps. Plop right into the friendlies vehicle while said monkeys plop into the enemy vehicle and wreak havoc! Brilliant! Uh, George, let's make a little effort next time.Now don't get me wrong, George Lucas, and Spielberg, are pioneers, and they have had their brilliant moments but this is definitely not one of them. If you're in your 20's this movie might be somewhat entertaining but if you're over 30 you will be sorely disappointed. He continually reuses his own and even others plot points, plot devices, etc and doesn't even bother to shade them with a degree of originality. Car chases next to harrowing cliffs, allowing Indy to get pounded repeatedly by big burly foreigners (Here a Russian, in ROTLA it was a shirtless German at the airstrip) but escaping with only a bloodied lip, impossible stunts that only Superman could survive (3 times over a waterfall in some half-ass amphibian vehicle that must have had some kind of alien force field surrounding it? Please.) I could go on and on about this shameful excuse for a franchise finale but I'll just sum up the most obvious embarrassments thusly: 1. Did you really have to make a crystal skull that looked like it came straight from Alien and then jam it full of tin foil to try and seduce us into believing it was some sort of ancient artifact? Look closely, I really believe it IS tin foil! 2. Did you really have to put some headband on Indy to help him ""communicate"" with said alien skull? So embarrassing.3. Hurt kept insisting they weren't aliens from space but instead inter-dimensional beings yet you had to throw in a flying saucer for the finale. Why? Were you on drugs at this point? Out of prostate meds? 4. The kid/son angle wasn't even necessary, nor was bringing back Karen Allen. I was looking forward to Karen Allen's return, in fact, but once I saw her performance in the dailies I would have cut the whole shebang. All that smiling and fawning and stiff acting just screams ""Thanks Mr. Spielberg for giving me a chance to make a few dollars off a character I cared about years ago but I'm afraid don't any longer."" 5. All in all, this horrible excuse for a franchise finale shows little effort from the writing department (George Lucas), from the actors (All, even Ford acts like he just woke from a coma), and from the yes men and women that didn't call the above for their lack of love and dedication in creating a final Indy episode that would be worthy of it's predecessors.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
858,alexisbessonmackain,the second weakest film of the franchise,5,20 October 2018,"I have always been a huge indiana jones fan from childhood with my least favorite one being the temple of doom which is mainly due to irritating characters even though it still had its moments. This film however, i deem to be the second weakest, mainly due to a thin storyline and thin side characters though shia labeouf gives a funny performance as Mutt Williams and ray winstone, cate blanchett and Harrison ford do pretty well in their roles. Overall, one can narrow it down to george lucas' declining career at the time with the star wars prequels (even though the third one is quite underrated by fans) which also extends to here as shown through his science fiction themed storyline (in contrast to the others which focused more on religious and supernatural aspects which made them more intriguing as they actually involved elements of history in their stories and using them in imaginative ways). Another major problem with the storyline is that Indiana Jones unlike the first and third films does not go through much development other than showing more wisdom throughout the film and better fighting skills. George Lucas tries to develop him by adding new family aspects such as a hidden son but (i will keep this secret from those who have not seen the film) it comes off as feeling forced and unnecessary. The film in its first half started well with minimal if still irritating use of CGI but the second half becomes too over-the-top and ends up feeling like a michael bay film (though still better because it jettisons the stereotypes with the exception of soviets and the crude humour that makes up most of his films). I know the other films had over-the-top moments but they were always one in between moments while this one has multiple moments which will only make you cringe if you are trying to take this fim as seriously as it predecessors. The villains while also pretty good are nowhere near as entertaining as the nazis and mola ram, mainly igor jivkine's performance as dovchenko who serves only as the big guy for indana to fight like in the other films and yet does not feel like much of a character. The film's pacing is also too fast which does not give us much time to get to know these new characters especially well unlike the characters in the previous installment through meaningful conversations.Overall, I would recommend this film to any Indiana Jones fan but my recommendation is to have low expectations and avoid taking it too seriously and you might enjoy it as an entertaining, brainless action film for 2 hours.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
859,alexisbessonmackain,Better than Temple of Doom but inferior to the other two,5,14 November 2018,"I would like to say that like my previous reviews for star wars i am also a big fan of this franchise and consider it harrison ford's greatest action role unless you also count the fugitive and his role in star wars. First off, at the time when i first watched it, I had not even watched the last crusade. Now, I really find it suffers in comparison mainly due to a lacking story as well as lacking characters which i will lay out in a list below:
Good about the film:
Most of the performances are pretty good particularly Harrison Ford and Shia Labeouf's rather funny performance, only complaints i would give would be to karen allen and the late John Hurt as Marian and Oxley respectively though this is more due to poor writing than anything.
John Williams still makes a brilliant musical score for this film and adds a number of new music themes to the franchise.
The action scenes are quite engaging as well, even if not as exciting as the previous films.
Still hilarious at points, particularly the nuke the fridge scene which is so bad that it is good
However after this, things take a turn for the worse:
the side Characters are nowhere near as engaging as previous ones in the franchise though i found them better and less irrititating than willie scott and short round in temple of doom.
The storyline while a good change of pace is poorly written and poorly paced, leaving very little room for character development.
CGI is overused, particularly its second half. The star wars prequels used extensive CGI but i give them a pass because they are science fiction while indiana jones was more about historical adventures rather than alien beings.
What character development there is feels rather forced particularly the familiar revelations which i will not delve into further as i do not want to give too many spoilers.Overall, despite the vulgarity of my review, I would like to say that if you get a chance to watch this film, I recommend you watch Raider of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade first to understand the character of Indiana Jones and then see what you think, Overall, if you do not take this film seriously, you will probably have a better time enjoying it even though it is lifeless compared to the two I mentioned.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
860,Rabensblut,This film was OK. Indy is old but still entertaining.,8,26 May 2008,"This film was OK. Being a fan of Indiana Jones for more than Twenty Years I can say I was not expecting nothing special. Many of the people wrote that he is too old that there are no Nazis. I really liked the Temple of doom and there You can see no Nazis at all. Russians are not new to the franchise of IJ, if You just played IJ and the Infernal machine and that game came out ten Years ago (DR. Volodnikov and his hounds). The action OK. Just as in the old films. The action, superb. This was the point of which I was not expecting much, but I really liked it (even the Tarzan scene was quite OK). This film is not about to think about it but to have fun.

861,davidandrewvantonder,"Disappointing for fans, pretty average otherwise.",6,28 December 2018,"None of the whimsy and genuine swashbuckling adventure of the original trilogy. A tired, weary almost bumbling Indy is not good for fans. If the addition of Shia was supposed to inject youthful vigor into the franchise, it did not.
If your not a fan, then its a tepid adventure movie with some average sometime laughable special effects, a cast with little chemistry and a supposed twist ending which leaves you wanting less.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
862,Dukat-4,"Not as Bad as Said, but Worst of the series",7,31 August 2014,"Temple of Doom and this movie share one thing: Indy absolutely panics about snakes.Oh, I get it. He hates snakes. He says so in Raiders. But he still manages to overcome his hate and climbs down to them into the Well of Souls.In Doom and here, though, he absolutely panics. Slapstick-level. Up to the point to threaten his life. Both movies are considered the bad ones. Coincidence? I think not.It seems that the creators of the series did not realize the bad decisions they made in Doom. For Crystal Skull, they took every bad idea they had, and turned it up to 11. It's still not a complete failure, considering it's meant to be a homage to 50s B-movie, but a wholly unworthy entrance into the series.There are too many unbelievable narrow escapes, too much slapstick, too much bad jokes (prairie dogs? Really?) tight spots they came out of by sheer luck, not talent, and too much superstitious hocus pocus. Sure there were artifacts of unbelievable power in the two better movies, but their power was kept for the climax. Doom also had some overbearing magic (glowing river stones and open-heart surgery), and it nearly killed the movie. Here, though, the magical powers of the crystal skull are present throughout the movie, and often drive the plot. Too often.It's still an entertaining ride, but a noticeable shift in tone that makes this almost not-Indy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I can see why this is hated so much. Don't blame Spielberg, blame George Lucas and his awful dialogue, horrible CGI, and almost everything else. Plus, ugh, the aliens... First Star Wars, now this? Even Cate Blanchett isn't safe from this. Also, Mutt, or ""Henry Jones III"" just acts like a d-bag all the time. Definitely in my top 10 worst films I've seen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
864,RevengeOfBobRoss,The fanbase is simple wrong- Indy 4 is a great experience!,8,25 May 2008,"I could write a full review, but this comment is designed to quell, or at least counterpoint, the rabid fanbase reaction. I myself belong to this fanbase, having been an Indy fan since I was 10. I grew up with these films. Raiders of the Lost Ark is my all time favorite film.George Lucas is popular to bash. I didn't hate what he did to Star Wars completely, and here the fanbase seems to be grasping for more reasons to trash Lucas.The script is fine, it's better than Temple of Doom and very close to being as good as Last Crusade. The characters are classic, and even the new characters bring something to the table.The real reason this film works so well is the trademark action sequences. The opening scene starts the film of right, there are two vehicle chases, multiple puzzle-solving and excavating scenes, a killer climax- everything previous Jones films do so wonderfully.The fans seem to be averse to the use of CGI. Indiana Jones films always used up-to-date special effects, it simply would not make sense to make the effects pre-1990 just to ""preserve the look."" The film is different, that's for sure, but only in age and time period. This alone has caused such a ridiculous fan backlash that the film's rating dropped nearly 1 point in three days on this site.I think too many people were just expecting the film to be horrible and just saw what the wanted to see, and nitpicked, going so far as to ridicule the film's realism. Because that's definitely what we remember the series for- it's shocking down-to-earth realism.This film is action-packed, and it's Indiana Jones! It does nearly everything very well. I will be seeing this again soon, and will but it on DVD. Wonderful film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
865,paintbeforeassembly,Exactly!,5,3 March 2009,"This is EXACTLY what I thought when I saw it. The storyline is fantastical, and stretches your belief far more than any of its predecessors did, but the heavy-handed use of CGI to stage impossible (and unnecessary) scenes within the film completely ruined it and shattered what little suspension of disbelief was left. Worse, it ruins any sense of tension, because too often their way out of danger is with the utterly impossible.I wish they had never driven the jeep. That jeep chase scene is like a massive cancer in the heart of this movie, but it's just the most obvious example of a problem that runs through this movie, and through far too many others these days -- over-use of CGI. Stunt-men always helped movie heroes achieve the impossible, but CGI takes it one step too far and makes them achieve the unbelievable.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The objective story eclipsed the subjective story and we wound up with a totally dissatisfying film. And puhleez, don't bring back Shia LaBeouf's character Mutt. Respect your fans. Hire a master screenwriter and don't screw this up...again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
867,adlion944,I had a very good time watching it,8,1 June 2008,"I'm a huge Raiders fan, I would say it's in my Top 10 faves. The sequels were dips, big dips, but still better than 95% of films ever made. I'm also 38 years old so I saw them when I was a kid - through high school.I walked into this thinking it would be Indiana Phantom Menace, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I had a blast watching. I heard it was full of exposition (SW prequels anyone?), but I didn't find it anymore than Raiders had -- and necessary. I liked the Soviets as villains. Cate Blanchet was pretty nonthreatening, had no chemistry with Jones and her accent was ridiculous. (Wasn't an authentic Russian actress available?) Shia Labouf was nails on a chalkboard in Transformers - manic jabbering irritant. But he was subdued on this and just the right fit. Karen Allen felt a little forced into the movie with her 1980s hairdo in the 1950s, but not too bad. I could've done without Ray Winstone. Honestly, did the plot really need him? And they left the ESP/telepathy and FBI witch hunt plots completely unresolved.The plot itself was confusing at the end. I have no idea what the aliens were doing frozen. Why 13 skeletons turned into 1 alien or why they swept up the jungle and flew into space, killing the Soviets. Why drown the valley? If they're a secret, why the elaborate city and the artifacts? Why destroy all those ancient artifacts if the aliens seek knowledge? What did they have to do with Roswell, NM? Why did the Soviets find multiple crash sites in the USSR? Those are some incompetent aliens, I must say.It all made zero sense. But it was an exciting ride to get to that climax which I enjoyed. The stunts were typical over-the-top. The waterfalls, the sword fight, the Tarzan swinging -- all in good fun. Stupid, but it made me laugh. Plus, there were some good laughs in many other parts. The quicksand pit was funny.I found the into sequence in Area 51 pretty good. The bomb blast was hilarious and ominous. It's ridiculous that he survived being thrown 5 miles inside a fridge, or that he survived being irradiated, but it made me laugh.Were there too many CGI effects? Definitely. In fact, the whole movie had a blurriness and a fuzzy glow to it. Very noticeable compared to Raiders with its crisp film stock and practical effects. Don't believe the Spielberg BS about no CGI and a 1970s film look. Absolute lies, both of them. Fuzz and CGI galore.Anyway, this is head and shoulders above National Treasure or Mummy crap. Or pretty much any summer movie any given year. Check your brain at the door, realize it's a comedy and go in with low expectations like I did. I'm really glad I liked it. I feel much like I did when James Bond was rejuvenated with Casino Royale. Very satisfying to know our heroes are back!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I kinda got used to the fact that the Americans have different taste when it comes to movies but this one HAS to be bad for everyone. It was really lame, simply NOT funny. I want the 2 hours of my life back! I can be pretty demanding, when it comes to movies but I also can enjoy something just for fun, mindless action or comedy. However, this was neither good action nor comedy. I usually like Harrison Ford, he's quite an actor. But I didn't see any progress from the old Indiana Jones yet it might be even worse. And the alien thing, that's what really got me. What a trash. So my message to the US audience: Watch it! It's totally cool! You have to see it immediately!

869,wspeedc,A Great Return...But A Few Faults,6,22 May 2008,"Let's all be honest here...what made the originals great was the fun, adventures that Indiana set out to do. This movie was definitely entertaining and had some classic lines that simply put a smile back on your face. Reminding us of how good the originals were and what they brought to the table.However, there are two main turn-offs that my friends and I agreed on. For starters the Nazi's were by far the coolest bad guys in the originals and I don't understand why they had to jump ahead in time and change all of that. I won't say who the bad guys are in this film because that would ruin it but I think you would agree with me. Secondly, another factor that made the originals so lovable was that Indiana sought out artifacts that historians have written accounts of that they did actually exist. The arc and the grail for instance...however, what they seek in this film that relates to the crystal skulls is one of those myths that is simply a spoof. Furthermore, Indiana always had a strong desire to go after the grail and the arc because he knew exactly what he was going for and so did the viewers. In this film no one knew what to expect the skulls were to do and it took away from the classic Indiana feel.This film was great and I recommend it highly. If they had just kept those two things to the classics it would have been up there with the rest of them but because they didn't they simply can't match Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade (my favorites). It is definitely worth viewing though...trust me they could have butchered it, and they didn't.8/10 I star off for each mistake.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I knew it wouldn't be as good as the first three but I thought maybe it could pull off a 7/10 so I could leave the theater satisfied. Instead I went home and watched Hot Shots! Part Deux, which sadly was a better movie.All the movies were unbelievable but this one was over the top. He survives an A-bomb in an old refrigerator, Mutt swings effortlessly on vines through the jungle, and when did Indiana Jones turn into a decorated war vet? That doesn't fit his character at all.I'm not picky, I like action movies, but 10 seconds after the Paramount screen faded i knew this movie was going to make me sick. Good job George now you've ruined both of your successful franchises, you should have retired 19 years ago.PS. Did Tom Cruise secretly produce this? Because it was definably scientologist propaganda. The first movies had proof of god, now this one has aliens? Now I'll never know who really created the universe.

THen the movie becomes a snooze fest and Spielberg and Lucas stuff Shia L. down are throats. The car/boat chase is fun but that's the only fun scene in the second half of the film. Even in that scene Shia is the man action person rather than Indy. What were they thinking? I have no idea. The people who love this film. I'm jealous. Personally, I wish I could be force fed cr*p and smile and say I love it. Harrision Ford is still good in the lead role but writing and directing let him down. Spielber seems to have lost all sense of pacing of his films. War of the Worlds also started out great and then became a snooze fest in the cellar.

872,Oroncz,Indiana Jones and the last promise,5,28 May 2008,"I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan, I grew up in the 80's and Indiana was the name of adventure. As children, we would pretend we are on our own adventures during school brakes and sometime after school playing with friends and thinking we would find buried treasures(or forgotten toys)and the excitement that led us was the spirit of great story's like Indiana Jones!!! So first thing that really disappointed me was to see in the middle of the film some children walking out of the theater!!! Unfortunately children know very well what they like or dislike, or for this matter what is good or bad. They where young enough to love this incredible character and old enough to understand his story...But where was the story?Like the ""mistakes"" made in ""Star Wars"" new trilogy, where Mr.Lucas wrote action scenes through two elements, nostalgic moments from the original trilogy and Kids jokes like Jar Jar Binks. So does Indiana 4, too many nostalgic moments where used to bring us fans into liking this installment, as if they didn't trust themselves anymore into writing a new story and adventure that we would love. Like other worried (but hoping) fans, I followed every piece of news on the Internet regarding this new chapter we waited for ""only"" 20 years, and one thing that satisfied was THE PROMISE Steven Spielberg made, which was that no Computer Graphics where to be used during the movie but only good old fashion technology to keep the feel and the looks of the original movies... Unfortunately that promise was broken, cg opens the film and completely demolishes it at the grand finale.I must say, the first two minuets of the movie brings a lot of hope to heart. The visual look, the camera, the music...(sigh) I was certain they pulled it off, but then scenes to follow disappointed and reassured that another good dream was gone.I relaxed on my seat, nodding my head, smiling and thought to myself ""not even this would ruin my warm place in heart for great archeology adventures that only THE REAL INDIANA JONES could teach me...""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
873,filmbuff-63,"The man with the hat is back, and this time...",7,22 May 2008,"It's hard to look at this movie on it's own merits, which does it an incredible injustice. There's so much to like about it, yet so much to make you say, ""Hmm."" How do you not compare it to the three films that came before it? And yet it's a story told in a completely different style- a fifties style as opposed to the thirties serialized movies that the others are an homage to. In that regard, IJATKOTCS is amazingly effective. From the studio sets, to the camera style to the dialog and indeed to the story itself.It's not giving anything away to say that this story is more sci fi than mystical. The Crystal Skull macguffin is more otherworldly than legendary and in my opinion, less interesting. I'd seen the ending of this movie already in the summer of 1998, even though it looked better here.Indiana Jones, and Harrison Ford are so stinking likable that I can overlook (no need to forgive) the things I didn't like about it. Still, there's something gnawing at my noggin about this movie that's leaving me unsatisfied. And it's not the plot point that is so cliché that it was obvious months before the movie came out. It's not the ending which was obvious from the first time you saw one of the characters appear just before the midway point. I can't even put my finger on it. It's something elusive.I'm a huge fan of the series- I remember vividly seeing RAIDERS when I was fourteen and falling in love with the whole idea: an academic/adventurer, used by the government to find ancient artifacts that may or may not hold mystical powers. It worked in spades for the first three movies and through a series of 12 paperback adventures which are all entertaining and well worth checking out (I strongly recommend the books by Rob McGregor- GREAT stuff!). I don't think it's that I'm 40 now and considerably more careful about where I spend my hard earned (I bought the novelization of CRYSTAL SKULL too). I haven't outgrown Indy at all. There were scenes in this movie that made me giddy and one that left a lump in my throat that my Icee did little to cure. The action is great- that whole opening before he goes back to the college was amazing.The supporting cast was great too. How many Academy Awards were represented here? What the heck was it that keeps me from giving it a higher rating?Maybe the pace was too fast. Maybe it sacrificed wit for story. Maybe the flow was a little too frantic. Come to think of it, I didn't much care about John Hurt's character until he appeared and I didn't know why Indy and Mutt did. Then when he appeared it was, ""Oh, this is they guy they've been talking about for 30 minutes. They didn't string you along with Abner Ravenwood so long in RAIDERS, but Marion's pain and Indy's empathy made that revelation work.Maybe that's it. No, it's not. I didn't like the alien angle. Just didn't work for me.But man, is it great to see Indy back in business.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
874,Shosanna_Dreyfus83,Le film atrocious!,1,2 January 2011,"What a poor excuse for a film! I'm not even sure which feels the more belated and pointless sequel in execution between this and Basic Instinct 2 (and I'm not even sure if this manages to be even slightly better than Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen after sitting through it). It is le film atrocious! What starts out as a average if uninvolving adventure story feels like a complete waste of time by the end of it, with people just going through the motions and the music trying to fool you that it's all more exciting than it actually is - didn't work! For a start, there are no Nazis! How are you supposed to see them being killed in joyous ways if they are not there? At least in Temple Of Doom, you could pretend that the Thugees were a ancient Nazi cult but the idea of Nazi commies would be just stupid! Of course not every film needs Nazis to be good. Take Rocky III for example. However, believe me that this film is certainly no Rocky III and does not come up to the standard of the three other Indiana Jones films which at least managed to be enjoyable and have some spark of life to them.The idea of aliens could have been interesting and the room with the skeletons made me expect something like Quatermass & The Pit. But the whole finale is a disappointment that does nothing with the idea and does not even give the title hero anything interesting to do (not much different to the rest of the film then - where Shia LeBoeuf seems to get most of the fighting). Everything about the film feels uninspired. Just how bad is it? Well, let's put it this way, mon amies. I have a male friend who only watched National Treasure because Bridget von Hammersmark/Diane Kruger was in it and thought she was the only good thing about it. But my same friend admitted that even if Bridget/Diane was in this Indiana Jones movie that it would still not even be as good as National Treasure (and I think he has a point)! An Indiana Jones movie not as good as National Treasure! Can you remember the days when to suggest such a thing would have had you kicking and screaming on the way to a shock treatment appointment? It is sad to see a once enjoyable adventure franchise fare so poorly but the makers of this turkey only have themselves to blame.

Harrison Ford is no longer quite as swashbuckling as we remember, and although it's good to know the best of us all get old eventually, it was a tad disconcerting to see him in such a way.As for the film itself, the plot was a bit harder to swallow than previous Indy films, as most of them had a degree of reality to them, so the suspension of disbelief was not so hard to come by, but this one might have pushed the limits a wee bit too far for me personally.There were some terrific action sequences, some amazing effects and scenes, but to try and compare this film to the other three in the series, it just doesn't hold up!

The character, the director, the score, the costume/s, the action, the fun. Like any Indy fan, I couldn't wait for another one despite having a perfect conclusion with Last Crusade. It took forever to finally have another Indy adventure. Was it worth the wait? First, the ark, then sacred stones, the holy grail, now a Crystal skull? Interdimensional beings? Henry Jones III? Not what we were expecting! What's neat about these skulls is that they actually exist and have their own mythology to them. Who better to have an adventure with them than Indiana Jones? The previews make it pretty clear what kind of movie this would be so the ending didn't really bother me that much.It's just wonderful to have Harrison Ford back. He IS Indy. Ford may look older and a bit rough when we first see him but that fades away as the movie goes on. He can still take a punch and give one real nice, even jumping around a bunch! There is a ton of action: the opening action scene in the warehouse, chase through the university campus, the very long chase sequence through the jungle. Some ridiculous moments here and there, but that is normal for this series. Re-watch the earlier pics and also remember what the filmmakers' goals were for these movies! Crystal Skull has a lot of familiar elements to it, with Russians instead of Nazis and the skull instead of the ark. Marion is back (great to see you) and Shia plays Mutt, Indy's son. I don't hate Shia but he wouldn't have been my first pick. I thought he did a good job here though. John Hurt is a favorite but his character is a bit crazy for most of the movie. Ray Winstone's Mac was a bit annoying with his constant side-flipping. Blanchett is beautiful and dangerous, lots of fun, though not as powerful as I thought she would be.There were a lot of nice nods to the original movies. Indy wears his signature outfit, we see the ark at one point, there are pictures of Brody and Henry Sr. on Indy's desk, a statue of Brody, the university, ""Henry, Jr."", so many more. I love the 50's setting: the costumes, Elvis, greasers, ""better dead than red"", area 51, etc. Some of the scenes have a glow to them that really works with the sci-fi tone.The script could have been better though, tons of exposition and weird sounding lines. Indy definitely figures things out pretty easy here, but I guess he is a professor?? Script?? The whip gets some use but not really his pistol. Silly prairie dogs, cgi, nuking of the fridge! tarzan scene, monkeys!Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: a ton of fun, a nostalgia trip, a different setting and new challenge for Jones with some old and new characters along the way, great action, twists and turns. Not as good as I had hoped but definitely not awful! My 3rd favorite of the 4!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
879,mozartzbitch,"Not really worth your time, but check it out for amusement's sake if you wish.",3,23 May 2008,"Well this summer blockbuster has more than begun, and has yet to give me positive results. With the excessively tongue-and-cheek rubbish Iron Man brought forth, and the anemic, hashed up rendition of Prince Caspian; I though Hollywood was finally ready proclaim this holiday season with Indiana Jones and Kingdom of The Crystal Skull. I was wrong. While all three of the films I have listed off in this article have had merit as pieces of film-making, they were all seriously flawed beyond their levels of praise.This forth installment of the Indiana Jones film franchise was believed for much time to just be another rumor George Lucas conceived in attempt to keep his name highly linked in the Calendar media. Some believed after a while, this back when the Star Wars prequels were spoken of for so long. And yet one day, the Star Wars prequels came. And what was the response? Let's just say, less than stellar. This forth Indiana Jones was actually weak for similar reasons as the Star Wars prequel set. The greatest flaw in Kingdom the Crystal Skull is a series of misplace energy. The original Jones trilogy was lauded for its marvelous action sequences that absolutely mesmerized viewers like no action had ever done before and some would some would say no action film has done since. This was plagued with petty one-lines (""I like Ike""?); excessively misplaced humor attempts (what was with the CGI rodents at the beginning?) and rather anemic action sequences. There are a couple scenes in which Indy enters a temple or kingdom with his son (yes, Indy's a Dad now), his double-crossing sidekick, Marian, and the man possessed by the crystal skull; and they're attacked by these peculiar Peruvian guards. There is a fairly exciting chase and a fairly exciting fighting sequence in the opening scene in the U.S. base; but neither of the scenes contain anywhere near the energy level empowered from the original trilogy.The best I could describe this film as is a well-intentioned mixture of all the different attributes to the original three films. It contains moderately well-developed friendships, a rebuilt romance, documented historical fiction, and a climax that doesn't rely on battles so much as intense visuals. But take a scene such as the returning of the crystal into the kingdom. Yeah, I mean the G-ds attacking an all was exciting, but it could not compare to the climax of Raiders of The Lost Ark, which this scene was plainly obviously trying to replicate. The development of chemistry between Indy and Mutt was nothing compared to Last Crusade and Indy growing to genuinely love his father at long last and vice-versa. Ford was certainly better 19 years ago, playing Connery than off LeBouf now. Ford also played much better off of Karen Allen 27 years ago than he does now. The rebuilding (AGAIN MIGHT I ADD?!?!?!?!?!) of Indy and Marian has bad sequel written all over it. It's a got a nice touch in the end, but it was much more realistic in Te Raiders of the Lost Ark.So in short, this film is a decent piece of entertainment, but little if anything more. It will sell tickets on its name brand not its quality. I say stick to the originals. Check this one out for curiosity's sake, but the good old trilogy can't be beaten.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Anyone who has not seen this movie yet, and thoroughly enjoyed it(and the other 3 in the series), has been living in a cave. This is more a comment on commenters, and would be self-promoting critics. If you had the callejones to give a Spielberg film less than a 7 you are an evil person in need of Chinese water torture. I'm saying 7.5 as a minimum only to punish the casting director for putting Shia The boufer in this one. Anyone else besides the boufer in the role of Mutt, and it receives an 8.5. And I do mean anyone! Shemp Howard would have been better. The ""Indiana Jones"" is a great series which I just repurchased on Blu-Ray(with a ton of cool extras), and watched all back to back on the weekend. These movies are just as good today as they were when released in '81, '84, '89 and '08. The plot, writing, stunts and acting all holds up to the test of time.

NOT LIKE THIS!!!!,1,13 June 2012,"When you see prairie dogs pop up in the first few minutes like a Disney film, that should have been the cue for me to walk out of the theatre.But how? This is George Lucas. This is Steven Spielberg! THIS IS FREAKING HARRISON FORD!!!!!!What did we get? Indiana Jones meets the Chariots of the Gods. How could Spielberg have allowed this steaming pile of camel dung to be chosen as ""the script?"". I've read Indiana Jones comic books with better plot lines! Writing: To say epic fail would be a compliment. Direction: Orson Wells couldn't have directed this and made it work.Acting: Harrison Ford: Here's the guy I really felt sorry for. He was the only one in character. He was the only one giving the audience what they were craving for. One last epic ride for Indiana Jones. I hope he got a percentage of the gross because he was the only one that deserved it. Grade: AKaren Allen: OK I understand, this is her first feature movie she's done in ages. But did she have to be giggling like an idiot in every scene? It was like she was thinking ""Oh my God, I'm in a big budget movie! I'm so happy!"". The chemistry Harrison and her had in Raiders seemed like a distant memory. Grade: DShia: I swear this guy is Spielberg's love child. How else does he keep getting work? He's pitiful as an actor. He was not cool as written. He was pretty hopeless, and I wish he'd been bumped off early in the film. Grade: F- and I'm being generous.Cate Blanchett: Weak writing didn't help her. Could have been an outstanding villain but she really wasn't that menacing. Grade C-Ray Winstone: What the hell? Triple Agent? Double Agent? Schizophrenic? Awful. Grade: DJohn Hurt: You've got to really have a bad script when John Hurt can't even give a good performance. Grade C- In short, unless you're one of those folks who watch a car crash for entertainment, or a glutton for punishment, just skip it. My Dad and I saw the first 3 Indy movies. I'm glad he wasn't around to watch this piece of trash.If it was just another Hollywood flop/cash grab I'd be OK with it. Considering the time between movies, this was the best they could do? I basically consider the movie was a nightmare, and they just never made a fourth Indiana Jones movie. That's how bad it is.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

883,mhmunim-1,Im not a rabid fan-boy but....,5,30 May 2008,"The thing is think about it. People waited so long for this movie to come out and were disappointed. I'm not a ""rabid fan-boy"" but even I went ""what the hell is this"".For me the biggest issue was the plot and the very underdeveloped characters. Lets start off wit the plot. The First film deals with the Ark of the covenant, a biblical items which, whilst a bit stretched its makes for a good story. Second film dealt with the stones of shakti mythical stones, mentioned in Hindu texts. The third film deals with the holy grail. The fourth film however went on a complete tangent and moved into the realms of aliens. That has got to be the most far fetched story ever. Very few mainstream films can pull of the alien plot, this however isn't one of those films. They could have kept the story as it and explain instead that instead of aliens they were priests from a forgotten civilisation.Then lets move onto the characters, the villain was like an afterthought. In the other films you feel the history Indy has had with them and they seemed more robust. Ray winstones character was laughable again there's no story into how their relationship developed. For example in the previous films we see how Salah became friends with Indy. And finally Mary and Jnr. think about it, Mary's character seemed lame like she carried on where she left off. No antagonism about being ditched. And jnr. well Henry Jnr and Snr. quickly embraced they were father and son in record time, what happened to the hurt confusion and anger that come from this. Tehy chemistry that existed between father and son in the last crusade simply isn't there.Its small things like this that can improve a film.Its really unfair for Lucas to say this is just a movie, a lot of people remember the magic feeling of his previous films and waited a long time for it. When watching this I felt he really wasn't bothered about the movie, just how much money he could make from it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
884,crimebusterofthesea,Oh dear...,4,22 May 2008,"The Last Crusade clearly wasn't what it should have been- The Last Crusade..Indy riding into the sunset...Instead we get this.. Crystal Skull film There is a serious lack of Indy in this film.Henry Jones Jr. is overshadowed by the presence of too many other characters, Mutt (LaBoeuf), Marion (Karen Allen), 'Mac' (Ray Winstone), Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and Oxley (John Hurt).The main sequence of the film consists mainly of Mutt and Spalko, Indy is sidelined to showcase Shia LaBoeuf.Spielberg clearly loves LaBoeuf, and this film proves it.Maybe Darabont's script didn't give enough room to the character Mutt), hence why they didn't make it..?It would have been better than this.This is the film George Lucas wanted to make and not the one the fans wanted.This may as well have been Mutt the Movie.John Hurt's character Oxley also appears as a blabbering mad man who does most of Indy's work.Despite how much time is spent on fleshing out these characters, it is hard to care about them.Ray Winstone's Mac is a cliché, in fact he is an exact copy of a character from Last Crusade who I obviously won't reveal for spoiler reasons.Ray Winstone, being an actor and person who I enjoy in films, is a very likable guy but even his best efforts could not save this character, let alone the movie.Oh and for the apparent limited use of CGI?Don't believe a word. Everyone I saw the film with pointed out the OVERUSE of CGI in a film where we were promised it's limited use.There were occasions where I'd watch a sequence and think 'Why was that CGI when it didn't have to be?'.I could not find one part that I would say 'That was great, classic Indy'.There were a couple of funny moments but they could not fill in the cracks in this film.This was clearly very disappointing for me, I was excited to see Indiana Jones back again, but I left the cinema very annoyed.If your unsure of whether to see Crystal Skull, don't.You will be left in a state of bemusement as the credits roll, simply wondering, where did it all go wrong?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
885,anth-2,"Another Indy movie must be made, if only to restore the franchise reputation",1,29 August 2009,"I remember seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark at the Wellfleet Drive-In on Cape Cod when I was 5 years old. The movie was so intense in spots, especially the Wrath of God Nazi-melting ending, I ended up hiding in the back of the car and peeping above the back seat so I could ""safely"" watch the rest of the film.That movie set a standard for me, the perfect amalgum of the old action/adventure serials of the 1930's giving us a smart and witty rogue who always fought the bad guys no matter what crazy situation he was thrown into. He got the girl, saved the precious artifact, and made sure the world stayed safe from the bad guys.But this film, this construct of creative genius's, show not only are they well past their prime but how they have encapsulated themselves into their own little world and not realized how badly they have maimed the treasured memory their fans carry of Indiana Jones.The film, on paper, has all the aspects of a great film: fascist bad-guys, rare and exotic antiquities, remote locales, double-agents, hostile natives and lethal fauna, and even the return of a long-lost love with an important (if predictable) secret.But put together in the ham-fisted way they were, with poor direction and mediocre screen writing, it wrenched my heart to see the mess that appeared on-screen. I will not fault the actors, but I lay the blame squarely at the feet of the producers, writers, and directors. I *wanted* to like this film, very much so. I saw it with my brother, and for a week afterwards we were in a kind of shock; we would say to each other, ""Yeah, that was a pretty good film."" After a time though, we slowly admitted to ourselves, ""God, it was awful. Why was it so bad???""Another Indiana Jones movie must be made, if only to wash from our mouths the terrible taste of this one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
886,Drooch,Promising start but goes off the rails,6,23 May 2008,"It starts brilliantly and for the first third of the film I was blissfully enjoying something I never expected to see - a new Indiana Jones film in league with it's predecessors. Then something bad happens - the script spirals out of control - the film loses it's soul but keeps on going and going until it reaches a misjudged climax. There's enough good stuff to make it worth watching, and it's GREAT to see Indy again - Harrison totally pulls it off - but with 18 years to play with they could have cooked up a much tighter script.The film feels 3-dimensional to begin with and promises so much, but the rest seems like a montage of ideas with no through-line, it loses all grounding and becomes a cartoon. Characters start to behave inconsistently, subplots inexplicably vanish, action scenes escalate beyond physical reality. I wouldn't be surprised if Lucas has to answer for some of the more outrageous elements, including the crazy UFO stuff. I'd be intrigued to read the Darabont script that he vetoed...The crystal skull is flaccid. The immortality-granting Holy Grail inspired us with awe in Last Crusade, here we learn very little about the 'power' granted by the skull and the potentially fascinating curse/blessings of ultimate knowledge go unexplored. As a result, this McGuffin lacks gravity and is hard to care about.In fact, lack of weight characterises the latter portion of the film. There are few scary or dangerous moments which are needed to create the necessary sense of peril. Spielberg knows how to terrify an audience - dinosaurs, tripods, opening the Ark, choosing the WRONG grail - all made us sit up and prey for our heroes to survive - but the crystal skull and Russian villains are all too soft. In addition, the more ambitious action scenes are neutered by obvious CGI, which instantly plucks us out of the movie - I squirmed when Indy was about to get ground between a tank and a mountain in Last Crusade because he was stuck between real metal and real rock, replace those with CGI textures and all threat is lost.The clear, wide cinematography of the earlier films is replaced with blooming white spaces and an overuse of close shots, which combine with choppy editing to create an unreal and messy feel to certain action scenes. It's not all bad - there are some typically great Spielberg flourishes and long takes filled with inspired camera moves, especially early on, but as the script loses clarity so do the pictures. There is a sense that Spielberg wants to just get things over with, hence the reportedly quick shoot.As mentioned, Ford is on superb form as Indy, and the buzz of seeing him back in the hat carried me through some of the film's weaknesses. La Boef is also strong and his banter with Indy is a highlight of the film. Ray Winstone starts strong but plays the same notes until it becomes apparent that his character is underwritten. It's a pleasure to see Karen Allen again and most of her rekindled sparkery with Indy is fun, but occasionally feels forced and there's little for her to do after saying 'hi'. John Hurt and Jim Broadbent do what they can with, again, underwritten 2D characters. Blanchet's villain is striking but lacks humanity and clear motivation, and her psychic powers are flushed down the toilet of potentially interesting subplots shortly after they're mentioned, and she never gets to face-off against Indy in a meaningful final showdown of clashing ideologies which could potentially further the film's theme, because the film struggles to find a theme, because the script is a hodge-podge of ideas from multiple screenwriters. It all comes back to that damned script, and I really want to see what Darabont had to offer, which Spielberg apparently loved.When Spielberg publicly said to fans that he's 'making this film for YOU' it sounded like a good thing. I now realise he really meant - 'the reason I didn't pull the plug on this was for YOU'. After 18 years of tussle with George he seems to have finally given in and made it, deciding that the benefits outweighed the costs. He's right, and the film's merits outweigh its shortcomings. It's flawed - it warps from a charming little film into something bloated and insane, like Lucas, but it's certainly an Indiana Jones film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
887,kurgan_uk,At Last! everything makes sense,8,29 May 2008,"I left the cinema and it felt like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders. It was all so clear now, Raiders, Doom, Crusade.. not religious artifacts... ALIEN artifacts left behind by visiting spacemen and taken by the superstitious primitives as instruments of God. It makes more sense.. Imagine if you find conclusive proof that God exists, how can life ever be the same knowing everything you do will be judged.But presenting aliens as the source of magic brings the universe back into alignment again.. Thank you George and Steven.The problem with Indy 4 isn't that it's a bad movie, it's definitely not a bad movie. But I'm not 12 anymore and there have been umpteen Indyalike movies in past 20 years so the magic has been spread thin. I still enjoyed it though. I liked the over the top action.. Lead lined fridge in a nuclear blast.. 4 drops off precipices.. silly Russian accents, had me chuckling quietly to myself.If you are 12 and haven't seen any Indy movies before then you'll love it.

A lot of Indiana Jones fans all over the world are probably scratching their heads these days, wondering why a script (Darabonts) which Spielberg called ""the best he has read since Raiders"", was scrapped by Lucas. So he could give us this? Tarzan meets X-files?It just didn't rock my boat, like the first three.

890,archravenstorm,"A for effort, C-D for execution",5,29 May 2008,"I enjoy reading others' comments about movies, and many is the time ""ordinary people"" have saved me $$$. Pro and con, IMDb commenters help me get a better picture of a movie ahead of time than critics ever did. I've never commented on film before myself, except for this one, because sadly, the reviewer at NBC summed it up best ""Indy lost its joy"". And I'm still in stupefied disbelief, because it's INDY, yah know? Something you could count on for a good time. I NEVER thought I'd be telling people well, you might want to go to the cheap matinée. And I can only nod in grim agreement at the multiple, and often hysterically funny, documentation of the ill-done and overused CGI by other posters.Are negatives nit-picking this film to death, as a friend accused me of doing? No, they are not, I argue. Because when I go to the movies (as a huge adventure/fantasy fan) I want to lose myself. Indy, Star Wars, POTC, Transformers, the Mummy films, Jurassic Park, LOTR, Batman, Iron Man....I want to sit in a theater with my jaw dropping like I did at the first sight of a dinosaur, or be cheering Indy on. I'm not fussy - people pan all these films, but I had a wonderful time with most of them, and can easily blow off bad spots in a film, here and there. I'm looking forward to the Mummy 3 right now. And the Dark Knight. And Harry Potter.But I couldn't lose myself with this Indy - CGI prairie dogs? Why? All I could think of was the dancing gopher in ""Caddyshack"". Why is a mineral/crystal skull being handled as lightly as a paper cup? Why are so many of these scenes seemingly rip-offs of the Mummy 1 and 2? The horrible rubber snake - what happened to the lovely pit of snakes in Indy 1? I thought Shia did as well as he could - but as a tough guy - not credible, he looks like a metrosexual. Why is Marion acting like a scatterbrained over-medicated housewife, and why wasn't there more beef, or something, behind the pivotal Indy/Marion reunion? Why wasn't Indy's face pulverized by flying sand in one scene, and why doesn't he (at least) have radiation poisoning? Not a good sign when your brain is ticking off one inanity after another, or you're thinking you should have gone to see Narnia instead. I'd like to be kind, and think Lucas and Spielberg thought the audiences would really enjoy all the back-references to the first three, the heavy nods to the 1950s, the alien references. Maybe it was just a misfire. Or maybe, annoyingly, just because they love the 50s and aliens and special effects, as many have pointed out, they forgot the heart of Indiana Jones. Because even 20 years later I would never have pictured Indiana as faintly bitter and weary (the first 10 minutes it sounded as if he was reading a packing list), and have the ""aging, cunning, adventurer teaching the young arrogant kid"" scenario being pounded into my head with a crowbar. It's not his age - it was the flatness. All that was needed was for him to be Indy - we GET IT already that it's 20 years later.Like many, I could write volumes on what I found mortifying about this film. Not everyone in my audience felt the same, there was some laughter and applause at the end. There were some positives for me - the attention to detail re the 50s scenes, I thought the cycle chase was fun, the cave where the skull was found pure Indy, the initial escape from the Russians. I kept thinking the film would find its way, but 2/3 through it sank and never surfaced. I'm giving it a 5 because I think I see what Lucas/Spielberg were trying to do - but the best I can say is that it was OK. Sort of. In places. My father liked it. But still, you might want to wait for a cheap matinée or the dollar theaters for this one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
891,bellapeligrosa,I'm a little bit disappointed *WARNING - HERE BE SPOILERS*,7,27 May 2008,"Well after years and years of waiting, I finally paid my ticket and went to see the 4th (and final?) instalment of Indiana Jones.So the positives: The first and most obvious is the fantastic relationship between Indiana and Mutt. This is the true dynamic of the film, and it is a better film for it. It picks up the mantle of Indy and Henry Jones Sr, alike in so many ways, resentful of it, and yet with a wise-cracking fondness that provides much of the humour of the Indy series. Indy is at his humorous best when he is in conflict with other characters - even those he loves most. LaBeouf and Ford have a tangible chemistry on screen, and Spielberg knew what he was doing casting LaBeouf. I smell a spin-off film in the air...Unfortunately this cracking chemistry is not carried through with the other characters, and the film is weaker for it. Hurt's character Oxley, Allen as Marion and Winstone's character Mac are all so underdeveloped that their presence actually detracts from some of the more humorous and adventurous moments. Even the lovely Blanchett flounders a little with the skeleton of a character in Spalko. She's psychic - apparently. Her accent is strained and forced, as if she's trying too hard. There is no backstory, and she's not a worthy adversary for Jones. Without her pack of inept henchmen and Mac's sneaky help, she'd be clueless in the jungle. Never a hair out of place though - so kudos for that alone! You almost wish there had been some sexual chemistry between Indy and Spalko to spice it up a bit...Instead the love interest here is Marion, referring back to their fling in the Lost Ark. A long-running love/hate relationship, Marion was spunky, hard-drinking and saucy - the perfect match for an adventurous commitment-phobe like Indy. 1957 Marion is still feisty - unfortunately in middle-aged women it's called 'nagging'. None of the chemistry between the two characters remains - when she goes in for the smooch at the wedding Ford almost seems to recoil.The adventure set pieces and chases are satisfactory - with echoes of the trademark Indy adaptability but with less wise-cracking and amusing close-ups of Indy's long-suffering face. The traditional 'clues' were a little more contrived and slightly less romanticised. The natives were ridiculous and arbitrary adding nothing to the atmosphere. Time spent on the atomic bomb scenes would have been better spent developing the story later in the film. I thought National Treasure had a better 'modern day' plot. As for the aliens or 'inter-dimensional' beings - hey I liked it! It's a little leftfield, a bit different - if the path to getting to the climax could have been a bit more complex and the supporting characters more rounded, the film would be much stronger.BTW one of the reasons that the Nazca lines ARE so well preserved is that there is no wind or rain on the plains of Nazca. They are not all grouped together either - it takes a good hour to fly over just the major formations. One of them, not included in the film strangely enough, is what can only be described as a spaceman - complete with tiny body and large head and eyes. They are still one of the world's biggest mysteries and they can only be seen properly from the air. If you fancy a do-it-yourself Indy adventure they are definitely worth checking out.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
892,Lord_of_all_zombies,The Phantom Menace of the Indiana Jones Saga,6,22 May 2008,"To begin: I love Indiana Jones. I'm an 18-year-old male who grew up watching all three of Indy's classic adventures. So, simply put, I was thrilled to learn this movie was coming out.And, simply put, I have never been so disappointed.Perhaps Cate Blanchet held the only GOOD display of acting here. Harrison Ford's dialog was obviously forced, as though he were trying to be the same age as he was in the previous films, and almost every other line he said I just raised an eyebrow at how corny he sounded. Shia Labeouf, who I USED to appreciate as an actor, proves he can play the same role time and time again (Disney's Even Stevens, Constantine, Transformers, Disturbia... Has he ever played someone who wasn't just an obnoxious, rebellious teenager with the same inflection in every sentence spoken?). John Hurt's normally impressive acting skills were thwarted because of his role. And Karen Allen just seemed to be like someone with an ADHD/Alzheimer's mix.There is absolutely no sense of reality at all. Nearly every action sequence has some sort of ridiculously fake stunt and/or defiance of physics (And I'm not referring to any supernatural aspects).The actors and the stunts/action sequences force you to totally ignore reality.But the main thing is that it felt nothing like the classic Indiana Jones movies. I felt as though I was watching a 1950's version of National Treasure, but Nicholas Cage replaced with an aged Harrison Ford. The fascinating blend of history, archeology, religious aspects, and the supernatural was all so cleverly done, and the characterization of everyone in the films was pure gold. All of which were sadly missed in this Phantom Menace of the Indiana Jones series...Finally, the mystery surrounding the Crystal Skull seemed like it was just made up to try something different and get more tickets sold! I found it almost appalling... Throughout almost the entire second half of the movie I was slapping my forehead and saying to myself ""g*d*mn*t..."" On a more positive note, the visual effects were quite impressive!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
893,mkcrbl,It's just entertainment meant to amuse rather than being about a serious topic,7,7 March 2015,"There're plenty of people seriously criticizing this movie that I watched several years ago and found to be amusing. From what I recall, it has great scenery, as well as amusing action and goofiness. That's OK, for it's what it evidently is supposed to be to begin with. People seeking films seriously produced about serious or real topics aren't going to find this with Indiana Jones and other films mostly based on imagination and seekers of absolute perfection with movies aren't going to find many examples. At best, there're very few.I think Roger Ebert's review (linked in the IMDb page for external reviews) is very right. Many people who saw the earlier Indiana Jones films won't find this 2008 one great or as good, but it still provides entertainment.The review says, quote: ""... True, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stands alone as an action masterpiece, but after that the series is compelled to be, in the words of Indiana himself, ""same old same old."" Yes, but that's what I want it to be. ..."" So, even Harrison Ford was a little/mildly critical of this ""Crystal Skull"" film and, apparently anyway, the whole series. He evidently didn't strongly deride and just wasn't super enthusiastic about it. That's fitting for this film series, which provides amusement.The completely non-credible and also illogical content can be perceived negatively or positively. In the positive sense, viewers will be able to go with the film's flow, as illogical as it may seem; just going for the wild ride, say. After all, the movie is only intended for entertainment.Most people won't see these films for any reason other than just amusement. Some may see the films for studious purposes, but most seeing will do it only for entertainment.IMDb says that this film is action and adventure for genres, but it's also fantasy; very much based on imagination and not the real world.7/10 is my conservative vote. To give a higher rating, it'd be necessary to see the film again; but, the it was amusing for me and 7/10 is surely not too high for this piece.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
894,s-price476,Not Bad for A Film That Shouldn't Have Been Made...,7,28 May 2008,"I wasn't looking forward to this 4th instalment in the franchise, given the 19 year gap from The Last Crusade but it really isn't that bad. Indy is older but Harrison Ford does an excellent job as the older Indy without resorting to tired clichés about being too old for this and getting aggravated with the younger kid on the block Mutt Williams. The key to this movie is HF who really brings a warmth to the movie and made me hanker for the older films. The film starts really well with a driving dual between some American high school kids and 'American' soldiers on a dusty Nevada highway. The film moves well and the acting is good also. There is a good on screen chemistry between HF and Shia La Beouf. The problem in all this is: Overall the plot is half baked and by the time we get to the second half of the movie, I started to get a little irritated by the lack of tradition and stupidity in the plot which is a massive shame as the 1st part is great. Why does George Lucas get involved in the story? Without giving too much away, it would appear that GL did not complete certain parts of Star Wars and cruelly tagged them onto this movie. To sum up if you're really excited to see it, you'll hate this, however if you really aren't expecting a great deal (like I was), you'll be entertained. A word to the wise on tinkering with a successful franchise, please do not try to fix it if it ain't broke.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
895,bangor_09,Somehow you got to keep in mind that this film is not more of the same but a Closure to a great character before somebody get the awful idea and try to remake him,9,23 May 2008,"Do we get action? Of course, but done in a new way with Indy more involved with his companions for the fights than doing it himself like in the previous films, but not an inch less brave, and it was good to see a female as a villain without being a B..ch, guess Cate Blanchet is one of the few capable of pull that out.We have the mandatory Indy humor, but most of it will be perceptible only to those who have followed the series, it answer a lot of questions on Indy's time line (my favorite is the one where a broken crate show certain artifact thought lost forever) and gives you, although not perfect a tie with the TV. Series The myth behind the Crystal Skull is very well crafted and makes a perfect link between the prehispanic myths and the modern's urban legends, making this film a good bridge between the religion and science fiction realms.We get to see a wiser and more patient Indy, and you even remember his father in ""last crusade"" when in more than one occasion he starts to give history lectures in the middle of dangerous situation, my only problem in the plot was how easily the romance between Indy and Marion was reignited and ""Mutt"" somehow easily accepts his link to Indy as in turn does he, but I understand that for both the pace of the story and the idea that the leads are older and wiser the plot didn't went to any Soap Opera Drama, in order to keep the things moving.Somehow you got to keep in mind that this film is not more of the same but a Closure to a great character before somebody get the awful idea and try to remake him, just for the sake of pleasing the younger and present audience.In a way is better to leave the character to silently get lost in the crowd and in the times around him than try to make him change beyond its real persona just to fit in a world that it has moved on Would you like to see Indy as a super spy with a futuristic arsenal or surfing the net breaking codes for the government?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
896,cinema_forever19,"Whatever you want to call ""entertainment""...",5,26 May 2008,"I saw this at the cinema with family, and what a fun ride it was! But, it only lasted as long as I sat in the cinema. Because when you're at the cinema, that's all you want to do is have fun. But as soon as I walked out of the cinema, I thought it was a pretty mediocre film. When I got home and glared at all the great films I have in my DVD library - the classics I love so much, I came to thought that Indy 4 was practically atrocious by then. Because for me, rating a film is all about leveling between the best films and the worst films of all-time - in most cases, the films you've seen anyhow, whether of late or solely by solid memory. And this was not even a mile from being a classic.Indy 4 is a great ride at the cinema, great fun and nice to laugh with family. But there is really nothing serious, impressive, special or classical about it, at least not much. All I can truly comment on is the beginning half of the movie, which is fairly decent, but for the rest of the film it seems to take itself a little too silly and goes a little overboard filling itself with poor (but entertaining in the cinema) action/adventure sequences and highly over-used CGI. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against CGI in movies, CGI can be very nessecary, like in The Lord of the Rings, etc. But when it is used THIS much like in Crystal Skull, it just comes a little bit far-fetched! A return of a great action hero it is indeed, but in the end, it's kinda disappointing that he's not the hero we remembered him as... But all in all, it wasn't terrible, at least compared to the REALLY terrible films that I've seen in my days.Although, I think it is definitely the lowest in the franchise... 6/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
897,burney-imdb,Great Family Movie! I was pleasantly surprised!,9,26 May 2008,"After seeing some reviews from people who were disappointed with this film, I went in with lowered expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised by a great addition to the series. Compared to the other Indiana Jones films, this one was by far my favorite.It goes without saying that this film was visually much better than its predecessors because cinematic technology has advanced so much in the past two decades. The acting by everyone in this film was also much better than the previous ones, and Harrison Ford's much lower-key performance fit the older character he was playing.The best thing about this film was the pacing. Unlike the first and third films, this one was filled with action that kept all members of my family entertained. Unlike the second film, the pieces in this one seemed to fit together better. It had a great opening sequence filled with popular 50's references, an action-packed middle, and a solid ending.The story was interesting and not overly-religious, though I can see some people being upset that the classic adventure gets sci-fi elements mixed in.I loved that there wasn't a Nazi in sight in this film and that the ""bad guys"" were the Soviets (maybe that's because I grew up in the eighties fearing a nuclear winter). The ending wrapped up everything while at the same time leaving the series open for further expansion.There wasn't anything inappropriate for families in terms of sex, there was only very mild profanity, and the violence was much less graphic than any of the previous films (no spattering blood, ripped out hearts, or chilled monkey brains). My wife and I, and both of our girls loved it. Highly recommended.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
898,silkshadow,"Must see for Indy fans, for others it depends on how much movies cost where you are.",7,2 June 2008,"Unless you grew up with Indy, I would say this movie is not worth paying $6-10 (plus your gas driving to the theater). Older people who took their kids to see the first couple of Indy movies, you will be disappointed and confused. Kids who saw the Indy movies on DVD or on the movie channels, I think you will feel ripped off. I paid about $3 to see this movie in digital DLP, SDDS, THX, etc. For $3 its worth seeing no matter who you are.For those who grew up with Indy, this movie is a must see. Not because its a great movie (its not) but because the script was written for Indy fans as they do throwback jokes and dialog throughout the movie, which will make you smile. But I don't need to tell you as you already saw this movie.For everyone else, this movie is a disappointment. They waited 20 years for this script? I don't think so. More like they just ran out of other ideas and Firewall was so bad that Ford just needed something to get the taste of that one out of his mouth. Don't know the reason, but the script was not it. The story was superficial, doesn't draw you into the movie or develop any caring for the individuals in it. Worse, it didn't even take you on a ride, like some superficial action movies can do. The best way to describe it is that it was more like the story of a bad movie franchise based video game, which puts in all the elements of the movie series just so they have some enticing screenshots to put on the box and they can say ""just like the movies"".I gave this a 7 because the terrible story was offset by some really stunning visuals (without spoilers, let me just say waterfalls are pretty) and rather interesting set designs. Also, as I mentioned, they did include a lot of stuff for Indy fans, referencing the other movies and even pulling a surprise from the first one.Personally, I wish they rethought the entire last 30% of this movie, went back to the drawing board on dialog and story building throughout and didn't make the big climax so out of line with the story, the Indy movies in general and just plain ridiculous.I think the big problem was Sean Connery's refusal to leave retirement. If he took part in this movie, I'd like to think he would've said: ""Hold on, I didn't come out of retirement to do crap.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
899,juarez-8,2/3 brilliant,8,19 June 2008,Is this the Indy we want? Well short answer yes but that depends on what you were expecting. I'm not going to give away anything but it might help if you read a few books about crystal skulls before hand. Why? Because you will be able to enjoy the film a whole lot more if you know more about whats going on.Whats bad- There is one scene in the film were Indy survives something that no one could ever and that for me is the films only problem as takes away what future threats there are to come as you know he will survive. Also Cate Blanchet won't win any awards for scariest villain as there wasn't enough in the script for her to show how evil her character is.Whats good- Shia La Beouf could have ruined the film which is what most people feared but he pulls it off nicely. Harrison does it again flawlessly as Indy and the action scenes are really exciting.It starts on brilliantly and it continues to do so and as long as you have an open mind with a fair amount of knowledge about crystal skulls then you are sorted. Otherwise you just won't like it at all. Do as I say and you will probably give it a nine.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
900,Shanetmims,Indy's back!!!!!,9,20 October 2008,"This is my first review on this site.Steven Spielberg,George Lucas,and Harrison Ford. In the 1980's,these guys gave us one of the greatest cinematic heroes of all time:Indiana Jones.Between the years of 1981 and 1989,audiences went along for a ride they would never forget in not one, but three Indiana Jones adventures:Raiders of the Lost ark,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,and my personal favorite,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. All taking place in the 1930's,we all watched Indiana Jones survive great dangers while trying to capture rare and important artifacts,all having supernatural abilities in these films honoring the legendary 30's cliffhanger serials.Well,earlier this year,Spielberg,Lucas,and Ford returned to give us the LONG awaited fourth chapter,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. How does it rank with the others? Well,let's see.....When we last left Indy,it was 1938,and he had found the mysterious Holy Grail. It is now 1957. Fear of the Nazis has long since passed and now its Russian Communists our country has come to fear.Archaeologist-adventurer Indiana Jones has been captured by the Russians to help them find something of great importance to them.After discovering the item,however,Indiana manages to escape,but finds himself under government supervision due to involvements with George ""Mac"" McHale (Ray Winstone), who has been revealed to be working for the Communists. Because of this,Indiana is on temporary leave at his job. But before he can leave to continue his teaching elsewhere, a greaser by the name of Mutt Williams( Shia LaBeouf) shows up,telling him that his old college friend Harold Oxley (John Hurt) has been captured by the Russians and are planning to kill him because he found a object of huge importance to them. However,he has hid it and has left clues to its location,clues he knows Indiana can interpret. Now,Indiana and Mutt start their quest to find the mysterious Crystal Skull and save Oxley and Mutt's mother from a grim fate.I don't want to give anything else away. This is a truly great film and if you liked the first three,you will like this one as well. Harrison Ford still shines as Indy,and the other cast members(Shia as Mutt,Cate Blanchett as nemesis Irina Spalko,Karen Allen returning in her iconic role as Marion Ravenwood from Raiders of the Lost Ark) shine in their roles,as well. John Williams returns to score the film and does a terrific job,reprising classical themes and giving new ones to remember.The effects are good. The action scenes are incredible. The film looks incredible. If I have one complaint,it that it is not Last Crusade,and it is not as emotionally-involving as that film was. But it is more than worthy fourth chapter with everybody's favorite adventurer,Indiana Jones.Series Ranking -------------- 1.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade 2.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 3.Raiders of the Lost Ark 4.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
901,nicolasmarinus,"Only one stone standing in this rubble, Indy himself.",6,26 October 2008,"First off, what DOES work? Harrison Ford is still the man, the action sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat, the first shadow of Indy is a memorable shot and the warehouse scene is great.That's pretty much it, I'm afraid.The story lacks motivation. Indiana Jones has always been a man hunting for priceless artifacts, to keep them out of the hands of evil people and in the hands of scientists or rightful owners. He was never really interested in the mystery behind or the power of the artifact. That made it very easy to root for his cause. We have no idea what he was trying to achieve here. Activate the power of the temple himself so the Russians wouldn't have it? Maybe? It also lacks dialogue. What little there is reminded me of the Da Vinci Code. Fast and unconcerned with character development. As for the characters? John Hurt as Oxley? Whack him over the head and ditch him in the Amazon already! John Hurt deserves better writing than this.The effects? Super CGI-fest galore extraordinaire! No texture, no gritty realness. You can imagine the bluescreen studio behind it all.What is really annoying, is Indy and his merry men of followers that detract from the one guy everyone wants to see, INDY! And what's with these hordes of Russian soldiers who always just stand around, point their weapons and gawk? Indy and aliens? Really? Indy and atomic bombs? Reaaaally? It's clear they chose to plant Indy firmly in the fifties. That means rock'n'roll, greasers, atom bombs, communists and aliens! None of these work well with Indiana Jones. They could have shown him as an ancient relic, out of place in this ""new world"". Instead they chose not to bother too much about any content at all and just whip up a lot of action sequences and one-liners without any pacing or substance or story or dialogue.Everyone wanted this movie to succeed so bad! Except the screenwriters apparently.A missed opportunity.btw, Steve and George? If you really want to give people what they want? Show what Indy did during the second world war, kicking nazi butt all over the world!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
902,leo-pontinen,"Oh, that CGI..! Just do it naturally..!",4,17 November 2010,"It was refreshing to see something that was made with a little more of an idea of it just being a movie. There is obviously stuff to nitpick in the script and the character but that's not what was wrong with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.For me, a movie is immediately bad when it has an insulting attitude towards its audience. This can be seen through performances, dialog, an overall screenplay and more. Still, I could see that there wasn't that much of that in this movie. There was a lot of effort in places and that raises the value.The problem I had was the CGI. I absolutely hated the way the picture and the colors in the entire movie were done. This isn't just an issue with this movie but with every single video product today. Here's how it goes: With the digital technology, it is easy to manipulate the picture or the overall movie in this case. The filmmakers know that it's a lot easier to just synthetically make a scene look darker, colder, more moist or whatever. Unfortunately, digital effects will always, ALWAYS, be inferior to reality. That's why it's best to avoid using them or just do them as best as you can. District 9 is a good example.It's not just that. The look of the movie bothered me a lot. When everything was blurred and turned into a computer product, I just couldn't get over it. I got depressed and anxious while looking at it. On top of that, when recalling this film, it has stuck in my mind as an unnatural thing. My brain tells me to ignore the movie because there just seems to be ""something wrong with it"".That's the reason why I wouldn't even try including this movie among the other three. Would it have been better if there hadn't been any CDI except in an absolute necessity? If the colors had been left original, would it have felt more like the older Indiana Jones movies? I strongly think so...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

904,The_Film_Addict,"""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" isn't in par with its cinematically rich predecessors, but it doesn't stop the high-octane roller-coaster from being a fun filled ride.",8,4 January 2009,"After a 19 year leave of absence, Harrison Ford returns once again as the swashbuckling, iconic hero, Indiana Jones, in Director Steven Spielberg's highly anticipated summer blockbuster ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" With new added faces to the already familiar cast, ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" isn't in par with its cinematically rich predecessors, but it doesn't stop the high-octane roller-coaster from being a fun filled ride.When a group of Russian extremists led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) want to uncover the power of the crystal skull, they forcefully recruit the highly knowledgeable Dr. Jones to help assist the puzzling case. Because its 1957 and the fear of communism is on the rise, Indiana's reputation is severely tainted after escaping the clutches of his captors. Now being trailed by Russians, Indiana meets with Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) a greaser punk rebel who looks like a replica of Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One."" Needing Indiana's help to save his mother, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the two jet off into an adventure that'll have you cheering with joy by the time the credits role.With the dark annals of World War II being written into history books, Jones is no longer fighting treacherous, power-hungry Nazis; this time he's combating Russians. With the fear of communism and atomic warfare escalating, the paranoid induced era produced a wealthy amount of science fiction films commentating on current affairs. Although ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" doesn't necessarily make a political statement, it incorporates this ideology maintaining the 1950s tradition. With this in mind, it'll be easier to digest the film's climactic finally.This latest installment is by far the most different Indiana Jones film to grace the silver screen. The previous films seemed excessive, yet plausible. ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" goes overboard with its plot which may turn some viewers off. It's like an overblown pulp fiction novel equipped with maniacal villains, undead Aztec guardian soldiers, and death defying scenarios that will have you scratching your head. It's a lot to soak in, but there's no denying that it's a lot of fun.Even with all the elaborate sets, stunning computer graphics, and eye-popping action sequences, the film works wonders with its characters. This is something that the franchise has done so well over the years. They're extremely well likable charismatic characters. Who wouldn't want to be Mutt Williams, the punk, leather jacket wearing, switchblade talented rebeler? Indiana, who's all about education and responsibility, has endearing arguments with Marion, and it plays affectionately well.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" isn't a perfect movie, but if you're willing to go along with its zany plot, you may find the payoff well worth it. There are many of changes in this latest installment, die-hard fans may be disappointed, but there's no denying it; it is a fun time at the movies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

906,mkojder-1,Disappointed.......**1/2,2,4 October 2008,"Man was I pumped for this one. As a long time fine of the the first Indy flick, I was hoping for a more mature, interesting film about the character that was Indiana Jones. Boy, was I disappointed.There were so many plot holes and disconnects in the action, there was a missed opportunity to make more out of the punishing of innocents in the Communist witch-hunts of that era, and so much of the rest of it seemed silly - in a bad, ridiculous kind of way.The special effects were fine, I blame it on the lame story coming from George Lucas and its subsequent script. George Lucas seems to have done nothing worthwhile since The Return Of The Jedi (and even that seems to be hotly debated amongst fans) or The Empire Strikes Back (my personal favorite). And Steven Spielberg should know better - I can't believe this is the same guy that did Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List.This film could have been a smarter, and deeper look at a character's limitations in the face of aging and the changing world - it could still have had the action...just a little more realism and smarter humor.I think this was a real missed opportunity - rent it when it comes out, but I'd save my money for a better DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
907,SithApprentice,A solid return of everyone's favorite archaeologist,8,25 May 2008,"Beyond all probability, a miracle happened on May 21 this year: after 19 years of empty rumors, the archaeologist with the fedora and the whip finally returned to big screen, and I was there on day one to welcome him back. But was the return of Indiana Jones worth the agonizing wait?Similar to the first three Indiana Jones flicks, we're thrown right into one of Indy's adventures. It's 1957, 19 years after the end of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", and we find out that a visibly older Henry Jones, Jr. and his pal ""Mac"" (Ray Winstone) have been abducted by a Soviet special unit and taken to a military base somewhere in the desert of Nevada - namely the legendary Area 51. There, the Soviets under their leader Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) force Indy into finding a certain box inside a warehouse (complete with a nod to the end of the first film). After an extraordinary escape (involving a betrayal, a ride on a rocket-powered vehicle, a nuclear blast and a ""flight"" inside a fridge), Jones' colleague Dean Charles Stanforth (Jim Broadbent) reveals that due to pressure from the FBI (seeing as how his relation to the now-Communist Mac has made him a suspect), he has to take a leave of absence from his profession at Marshall College in order to avoid being fired. Just before he can leave the town by train, he is stopped by Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf), a young, motorcycle-riding greaser who reveals that an old friend of Indy, Harold Oxley, has disappeared shortly after the discovery of a mysterious Crystal Skull in Peru, and from then on, the plot begins to thicken as Indy, Mutt and Indy's old lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) hunt for the crystal skull and try to protect it from the Soviets...The MacGuffin of this story, the Crystal Skull, really is a breath of fresh air compared to the biblical artifacts of part 1 and 3 or the fictional Sankara Stones, and George Lucas was right when he said that the stories surrounding the crystal skulls are fitting for an Indiana Jones movie.Overall, the story manages to capture the feel of the old Indiana Jones films, even though there are two plot twists that might anger old-school Indy fanboys - I myself don't know what to think of them, even though I have to admit that, in a way, the revelation of the big twist near the end as well as the ending sequence left me a bit disappointed regarding the dialogue and filming - Spielberg and Koepp could have done a much better job here.When it comes to the actors, I am relieved to say that Harrison Ford is back on track with his portrayal of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. - both physically and dramatically, and he still dominates the screen. To say that fans have been skeptical about Shia LaBeouf's role as Mutt Williams is quite an understatement, but in my opinion, he really is a talented actor and delivers an excellent performance as the arrogant-at-first greaser - much better than his role in ""Transformers"". Next to these two, nearly all the other characters appear to be a bit undercooked. Cate Blanchett obviously has a lot of fun with her role as the cold, intelligent and dangerous Soviet commander, and while she does a good job overall, her character is too one-dimensional, and her motivations are too thin. The same goes for Ray Winstone's Mac: it's an okay-performance, but the only quality of the character that really stands out is his greed (and triggering comic relief), and he is no replacement for Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody or John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. John Hurt's character, however, is a complete waste. He doesn't have a lot of screen-time to begin with, and when you see him, he is not given many opportunities to show his talent, being relegated to an insane wreck uttering mumbo-jumbo. Everyone else isn't even worth mentioning, seeing that even Jim Broadbent's appearance is merely a short cameo. In the end, this movie lacks charming supporting actors to lighten up the mood.What really disappointed me, though, were some of the action scenes, the CGI and the soundtrack, normally marks of quality of an Indy flick. Most of the action scenes, lacked the excitement and creativity of the first 3 and felt too slow and drawn-out at times - sorry, but nothing as exciting as the boulder rock chase in part 1 here. Part of the blame goes to the strangely mediocre CGI. To tell you the truth, the effects are nowhere near as good as those found in the Star Wars prequels or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is a surprise for an ILM flick. Some scenes simply look too bright and colorful, while the CG monkeys were useless and badly animated. Oh, my dear John Williams. Usually, I adore your work, and with the soundtrack for ""Revenge of the Sith"", you have created the best music for any film I've ever heard. But this time around, all we hear are old, well-known themes from the earlier movies as well as some uninspired new tracks that remain in the background far too often - unlike Williams' other scores, this one is unable to tell the story along with the visuals, and it doesn't do anything to enhance what we see and to pull us into the story. That was quite unexpected, honestly.In the end, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" has its share of flaws, and it definitely isn't as magnificent as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Last Crusade"", but it ranks up there right next to ""Temple of Doom"" as a solid entry in the franchise that is better than anything we could have hoped for after so many years and such a tremendous hype.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
908,reginaszymczak,why? Why? WHY??,1,22 April 2013,"If you liked the National Treasure, The Mummy, and Tomb Raider films you will like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. If you liked the original Indiana Jones films, you will be frustrated, disappointed and annoyed. The phrase that kept running through my mind over and over was:""Are they serious?""In my opinion, what we have here is a case of Star Wars trilogy-itis. It's where you take a legendary film, remake it and give it excessive CGI injections and bleed it dry of story and smart dialog. For the amount of good that CGI has done for the film industry (especially for the action and fantasy genres) it's done just as much damage because now there seems to be a ""what else can we jam in there?"" mentality. Forget the story, let's just blow more stuff up. When the originals were made, the story was the primary objective and the special effects were secondary. I'm not saying that special effects aren't imperative to an action film's success because they are, but those big moments always have more of an impact if you have a vested interest in the story. After one too many ""Here we go again"" and ""I'm getting too old for this"" lines I realized that my Indy was gone and this was a movie that just had no plans on being taken seriously.Raiders of the Lost Ark dealt with the search for the Ark of the Covenant, The Last Crusade was the search for the Holy Grail. In this case it was tracking a Spanish explorer who was looking for a crystal skull that looks like it was filled with tin foil that has telekinetic powers? Or was it mind reading powers? Or wait thought... transportation powers? It doesn't matter, because by that point I was still laughing at Shia LaBeouf swinging on jungle vines alongside hundreds of CGI monkeys and please don't get me started on reappearing, laughing gophers. I could go on about the ending but I don't want to give too much away I'll just say that Indy is no longer dealing with Nazis.Damn you George Lucas and your influence over Spielberg.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
909,littlejimmy835,"Nowhere near as good as the first three, but if viewed on its own, it's okay.",6,1 June 2008,"Indiana Jones is back for a fourth film after 19 years. This time around, he's on a quest to find a crystal skull to lead him to a lost city of great mystical properties. And of course, he is pitted against some ""good O'l"" bad guys, naturally agents of the Soviet Union, who want to get to the treasures first. While this sounds like your typical classic romp and stomp Indiana Jones adventure, it unfortunately just turns out to be mediocre.Let's start with the good: This movie is probably the first ""true"" sequel to come out in years. For example while movies like ""Rambo 4"" and ""Die hard 4"", while still good movies, if you just changed their titles they would have no connections to the previous movies. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull however truly earns its title as an Indiana Jones sequel as it establishes firm connections to the other instalments in the franchise; all the original cast and crew have come back to reprise their roles, the film is shot in the same visual style as the originals, the film often uses stuntmen instead of CGI like its predecessors, characters and settings reappear, and the film is laced with subtle nods and homage's, such as the Paramount Logo to hill fade-in or the simular storyline with simular villains. Aspects like these securely place this film within the canon established in the Indiana Jones series.Add to this the fact that the movie can be plain old entertaining; the jokes are often funny, the sets look nice, the effects are solid, the action scenes are well choreographed, and the music it uses is the classic Indiana Jones theme. With the aforementioned, you could be led to believe that there is nothing wrong with this movie.However this film is filled with faults.For starters, the story is weak. And I do mean weak. While the previous three Indiana Jones films weren't exactly Oscar winners with their screenplays, their stories were intricate enough to carry the film; character relations would tension and blossom, the plot would often be loosely based on historical fact, Indiana would have to solve complex puzzles and riddles in order to find out where to go next, and all their characters had strong motivations to drive them. For Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it's really just a bunch of stuff that happens for no reason until the movie ends; it just boils down to bad guys just show up, make Indy look for some Crystal Skull, they follow some very loose connections to various locations for no particular reason, bad guys all die, oh there's an alien too, Indy gets married, and then the end, movie over, go home. That's all the movie boils down to. No twists, no surprises, just a straight forward A through Z account made for no other purpose than to get Indiana Jones back on screen one more time.And that's just disappointing.It's that weak story that is the source of the majority of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's faults. There are no big ""wow"" scenes that we had in the last three movies. Remember iconic scenes such as Indy ruining from a boulder, climbing under a moving truck, opening the lost ark to release demons, the man having his heart taken out while he's still alive, the mine cart chase, the speedboat chase, the discovery of the holy grail, or the countless other breathtaking classic moments that just rocked your face right off in the other movies? Well you'll find nothing like that here; instead make way for a scene of our heroes riding motorcycle through traffic while not doing any real stunts, or a scene of out heroes going over a waterfall on a boat a cliché scene you have seen in countless other movies, or how about a scene where an Alien spaceship takes off while being obvious CGI and once again not really doing anything spectacular. Really, that's about it. Nothing amazing ever happens, but by contrast, nothing boring really ever happens either. Stuff just happens then it ends and that's it To add insult, it's obvious that the movie has been modernised in order to better suit current moviegoer tastes. The use of CGI still comes off as excessive despite its ""minimal"" use, with every other backdrop in this movie is a CGI matte and even things as simple as monkeys or prairie dogs being computer generated. Indiana Jones doesn't shoot or whip anyone because it's not PC for a hero to kill bad guys today  it's only okay to punch them unconscious. And of course, the movie has to be filled with handsome actors, fashionable clothing, clips of pop music, pretty colours and too many effects shots which were placed in for no other reason than to be effects shots, just in order satisfy the short attention spans of the current generation. This is just disheartening and disappointing.In the end, I can only muster to give this movie 6.5 stars out of 10. While it was a real treat to see Indiana Jones back on screen one more time, and let's face it, this movie is a lot better than many other films coming out these days, it unfortunately doesn't do itself justice with such as weak screenplay, and quite obviously this film doesn't have nothing' on the three movies that came before it.It's a mediocre film: not great, not bad, just okay.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
910,Fizzwizz,An episode too many,4,22 September 2008,"I have to start by saying I'm a big fan of the original 3 movies, which unlike many other trilogies got better as they went along.Unfortunately this was an episode too many, far too long after the last. Most noticeably for me was that Harrison Ford did not seem at all comfortable to be back in this role. At 66 his physical demeanor did not carry and his performance was unbelievable, and I feel he knew it.Trying to resurrect Indiana Jones was a brave move, and was likely fueled by the potential profits rather than any loyalty to the legend. Given the history of this series I expected something special to make up for an aging lead star. I was sorely disappointed. It delivered a mediocre story that left me wishing the series had been left alone. The fridge scene made me cringe. Second choice would have been to find a new leading actor. But ideally leave the legend alone.The only real joy in this movie was John Hurt's performance. Awesome as usual! And credit where credit's due, Harrison Ford looks well for 66 and he did a fair job, just not good enough for the legend of Indiana Jones.I finish with an appeal to the film industry. Please stop trying to cash in on old hits. If you must resurrect old films, please pay them the respect of thinking about the art of film making first, and the profit second.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
911,Kaukomarsu,A Worthy Sequel,9,1 June 2008,"While IMDb is flooding with comments who give this film 1 out of 10 stars and then complain about the use of CGI while at the same time calling themselves ""serious Indy fans""... I just don't know what to think.This movie is not half as bad as some people would want you to think it is.Yes, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is best viewed when you keep in mind that times have changed. The 1950s is/was drastically different than the 1930s, and what's even more important, 2008 is drastically different than 1981, 1984 or 1989. All things considered, ""Skull"" is wonderfully old-fashioned in all the right ways. To compare this film's set pieces to ""The Matrix"" or other extravagant recent action blockbusters is unfair to say the least. You have to look at how this movie has been put together. All the elements from the previous Indy adventures that we love  and I love  are here. All the character types are here. And it's not a bad thing, it's crucial for a film like this to work at all. I agree that at times it feels there are even too many characters. Ray Winstone and John Hurt don't have that much to do or say  same can be said of Karen Allen, the last being mostly the biggest problem.Marion and Indy are not given enough time to interact with each other. Their relationship moves too quick. Yes, it's kind of same in ""Raiders"", but here, after all these years, they need to have more time together. They're not 20 or 30 anymore, they're middle-aged. As are many fans.I bet that if I had been able to see this film when I was 10 it would've been the best movie in the world. It isn't, but it's still the beloved Dr. Jones adventuring  and he's in good form here. Harrison Ford knows the character inside and out and plays him to perfection. Every expression, every line he delivers. That's Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford and no-one else is Indiana Jones.I really liked the character of Mutt, though. He's the real counterpart for Indy this time around, not Marion. While Mutt is a homage to Marlon Brando, his character is given enough to do and apart from Dr. Jones himself Mutt is the only new character with real substance and soul. LaBeouf feels at home in Mutt's jacket. He also has good chemistry with Ford, and it shows.Cate Blanchett does her best as Irina Spalko, but the character doesn't quite shine as did, say, Rene Belloq in the first film. She's a worthy Indy villains, but her relationship with Indy seems to be missing something. Maybe some kind of an romantic or sexual tension between them would've helped to make Spalko more interesting. Thematically the first half of the film is strongest. The scenes at Area 51 and the nuclear test site called ""Doom Town"" are beautiful and tense. They succeed in what they were designed to do; introduce the audience to the 1950s and climatize Indiana Jones himself to this new cultural environment, much changed when compared to the world before World War II.When Indy and Mutt start the real adventure and reach their final destination, the story stumbles a bit. The sequence at the Chauchilla Cemetery is classic Indiana Jones, but the Temple of Akator is not quite as well executed. Personally I liked the old Sci-Fi feel of the movie and felt that the spectacular finale served the story well. Yet I can understand why some people find it not suitable for an Indiana Jones film.In the end, ""Skull"" is a worthy sequel, but obviously it can never match the first one. Sequels never can. But when compared to ""Temple"" and ""Crusade"", ""Skull"" holds up pretty well. It delivers everything one might expect from an Indiana Jones film, but it does so in a way that is sure not to please everyone.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
912,HalRagland,"Been There, Done That, And Much Better Than This",5,23 May 2008,"Unfortunately, any new ""Indiana Jones"" movie is going to be compared to its predecessors, especially the epic and magical ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (ROTLA). ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" feels like ROTLA Redux, only this time I wasn't enthralled by every minute of the proceedings on the screen, but counting down the minutes for the end to finally come. Although I was only ten back when ROTLA was first released, I can't imagine the average 10-year-old would enjoy this latest ""Indiana Jones"" movie as much as the original.After many years of trying to come up with a story for the fourth ""Indiana Jones"" movie, George Lucas comes up with what is easily the most incomprehensible and unbelievable mess of the entire franchise. ROTLA allows the viewer to suspend all disbelief and go along for the wild ride happening on the screen. It also didn't hurt that the goal of ROTLA was finding one of the most sought after archaeological finds in history. The goal in ""Crystal Skull"" is to return an artifact to the site of a mythical city built by a mythical alien race during pre-historic times. I know this is just a fantasy film, but the search for the Ark will always be more believable to me as a viewer. What we find at the end of ""Crystal Skull"" isn't nearly as interesting as what we find at the end of ROTLA.""Crystal Skull"" leaves the viewer wondering ""Just what the hell was Lucas thinking?"". Indy survives a nuclear test blast by encasing himself in a refrigerator. A group of Soviet agents and soldiers are able to pull off a heist in Area 51 in Nevada and get away without being caught. Along the way there are stunts that you would expect to see in a ""Spider-Man"" movie.I can tell Harrison Ford really enjoys reprising his role as the action hero archaeologist Indian Jones. Yet these days the older Ford as Indy looks totally out of place as an ass kicking, bullet dodging action hero. Yes, he's still Indy all right. He's got on his trade mark hat, clothes and bull whip. Yet I couldn't stop thinking about how he looks like he belongs in a nursing home growing old with Marion Ravenwood.""Crystal Skull"" is there for curious fan of ROTLA, but I can't recommend it as an introduction to the Indiana Jones character for those younger people who might have never seen the original. Seeing ""Crystal Skull"" only reminded me of how much I need to see ROTLA again some time soon.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
913,GoodMovieGuy,Legend turned into an ordinary film.....,6,23 May 2008,"I am a big fans of the first three of Indy films, I watched it as a kid and mesmerized by it. I clapped with other people in theater when Indy escaped a near-death experience just by his sheer luck. The effects of the film stays long in my mind.The magic has gone. The fourth film only delivers a good action sequence. Not magic. Even the action is not all original. Sorry, but I have to say the action is easily forgettable. I walked out of the theater disappointed. The story is not believable.The acting of Harrison Ford is still good although he was a bit older and slower. Shia La Beouf is good. I like him. But Karen Allen is bothering me. I don't like the way she smiled through the dangerous scene, I don't like the interaction between her and Indy. The chemistry is not there and seemed a bit forced. Spielberg used the old formula for the new Indy movie. That formula is not working anymore because the viewer has matured. They has seen a lot of great movie between the last Indy film and the new one. That's the main problem. Maybe it worked for the old fan Indy movies, but not me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
914,tony-349,Movie Magic,7,4 July 2008,"I would not say this is the best Indiana Jones movie, but it was good. I guess the thing I didn't like about it was how much they played up Mutt Williams. When I go to see an Indiana Jones movie I go to see Indiana Jones, not his ""Mutt"" kid. Sorry, I had to say it.It was good to see Karen Allen again, and the movie was stunning naturally. I was confused by the story though. I mean it understood it but it seemed like a ""quick fix"" ending. Oh and I already saw that ending a few years ago on the second ""The Mummy"" movie, didn't I? Still the nuclear bomb going off, the refrigerator passing the guys in the car, exciting, and funny, just what you expect from an Indiana Jones movie.I think the decision to make another Indiana Jones movie simply to showcase Mutt Williams for another series of movies, well I didn't like it. I had no idea before seeing the movie, but it was so obvious to me while watching the movie that it got tedious.I guess I can sum it up like this, it should have been more Indiana Jones and less Mutt Williams.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

916,crookednose-05517,Watch it again! (2020 review),10,9 December 2020,"Giving it a 10/10 rating because it deserves WAY more than many of the 1-4 star average that it receives.IMDb should do a better job sorting reviews - seeing how the vast majority of these reviews were submitted at the release (in 2008) nearly 13 years ago by a bunch of fans who got the more family-friendly version of Jones than they expected.If you are watching this movie in 2020+, let me assure you that this movie tells another GREAT Indiana Jones story and I would regard as a Spielberg classic (along with the originals). Indiana Jones usually tackles religious artifacts, but this movie takes it a step further! I would even argue that it has more originality than The Last Crusade... but they are all great films nonetheless. I urge naysayers to watch this movie again! It does not disappoint!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
917,refined_cujo-1,2nd time round...i fell in love with it!!!!!!,9,24 May 2008,"WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS, DO NOT READ IF YOU INTEND ON SEEING THE MOVIE When i first saw this movie, i walked out of the cinema not fully satisfied, all i could think about was the far fetched and over the top scenes, so i pondered on that for a while which bought me down...so, i went back again to see it, and honestly, i LOVED IT!! i had so much more fun with it the 2nd time round. when you watch it the second time, you already know what silly scenes are in there so you don't get distracted by them and you focus more on the great things about the movie and there really is some great Indy moments (opening warehouse scene, motorbike chase, car chase through the jungle, the ants, and my favourite was the quicksand scene), and i found the fridge being nuked so much funnier and great when i saw it again, doesn't really fit in but such a classic scene.Harrison was great, i like the older Indiana. glad to see Karen Allen back, shes just fun to watch. Shia was good, had no problem at all. Cate was a great villain.so, when it comes to the far fetched goofy scenes i compare them to scenes from the original 3 that were out there and there not that different...1-Nuke the fridge was no less believable then hanging onto the top of a submarine and being dragged through the ocean2-Shia swinging like Tarzan, hello, Indiana swung on a vine that was conveniently there for his escape in the opening scene of Raiders3-going over 3 waterfalls, umm, hows bout Temple of Doom, falling out of a plain in a blow up boat, landing on a mountain without a scratch, then sliding off the edge and falling into rapids then racing down stream4-Aliens >> 900 year old knight that speaks perfect English in Last Crusadeso you see, the original 3 were out there too, but its just fantastic funpeople are being too harsh on this film and i believe as time goes on, it will get the appreciation it deserves...but i would like to see a fifth Indy film that sticks more along the lines of 'Raiders' and 'Last Crusade'.

I have to say it was like a pure injection of nostalgic flavoured smack, which is important in this new comeback genre.The connection between Mutt and Indy is what carried the film though. Unfortunately the action and story line was great upon till the interdimensional alien being type things came along. What a load of shite that was.Ray winstone's character was good but I felt would have been more stronger if he didn't keep switching sides.Karen Allen was terrible but necessary.Over all, I think it deserves a 7 out of 10 for its effort. I was really worried that the Indy saga would be tarnished by a poor box office hungry crowd drawer but thankfully it delivered an enjoyable watch. George Lucas lost his touch along time ago in this galaxy. Steven Spielberg is still knocking them out though.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
919,neilvh,Why Indy Why?,6,24 May 2008,"I think if I had the choice of giving this movie 5.5/10 I would but the extra half is only because the hit and miss film got me to the level of confused excitement with just the view of good ole Indy, who I have missed greatly over the years.Firstly I would like to say that there were a lot more hits than misses in this film. Mr. Ford has perfectly sunk back into a much older but still charismatic Mr. Jones which is what I really loved about this movie. Without it, it would've been harder to like the almost strained feeling of the film, as though everyone except Mr. Jones was trying too hard or not hard enough to bring back the Indy feel. LaBeouf was stereotypically impressive as Mr. Williams, and it felt great seeing Avenwood returning to spruce up some of the humor, which was quite presentable throughout the piece. The C.G.I was spectacular, in retrospect, and the action seems were really Indy. The clichés, although plentiful, didn't bother me at all as Indy is built on these which makes it so great to watch sometimes. One particular cliché that was cleverly deepened was Cate Blanchetts character. Whilst annoying at times, as I found her character somewhat uncomfortable to get used to, I realized that this is what her character should bring upon. She is the most characterized villain of the Indiana Jones trilogy, so well done to that.Having said that, the hits of the film, although impressive, do not outweigh the extremely disappointing misses. Firstly, the idea of including the sci-fi genre in such a major way is not only absurdly unrealistic, but has no place in the Indiana Jones series. I began watching the movie with such great premise but saw it dive slowly but surely to an inescapable low, even for Mr. Fords presence. Which brings me to the point that although the impressive C.G.I was well done, some of it felt awkward on the Indianan premises, and this made it feel once again unnatural in the aspect of the films. And even though the movies are renowned for extravagant and near impossible stunts, these were way too heavily dramatized.Maybe I'm missing the old Indy so much I am finding it hard to adjust to this modernized version. Whilst I understand the idea of alien invasion was riff during the 1950's, what with Roswell and Area 51, I still stand by the fact that Indy should not deal with this issue, and this caused the film to wear thin.As a family adventure blockbuster, its good, not clever, but sharp. Anything more and it was pushing it. Such good premise gone to waste.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

921,zarrod,"A mildly entertaining adventure film, but not remotely 'Indiana Jones.'",6,23 May 2008,"""Crystal Skull"" is fun in parts, primarily in it's character development (while brief and somewhat flimsy), decent performances by Harrison Ford and Shia Labeouf, and even the cheesy references to the past films. It's action sequences make for a few neat gags and some suspense but the big problem is that the Indiana Jones feel is nowhere to be felt.The new sidekick, Mac and his entire story are not at all intriguing and Professor Oxley is not much better. Marion is also way underdeveloped. By the time she is introduced, it seems that the only purpose all the characters is to move the plot forward. A plot which I knew was coming but was still very disappointed in. I blame George Lucas for his dreadful choice in ""MacGuffin"" or whatever as well as his insistence on relying on digital technology, even to display some prairie dogs. There was no bad guy development either. Cate Blanchett's character was much thinner than her accent. There was never a moment that raised the tension and energy level like in the other films, in fact, if there was even a climax, I totally missed it. The music also suffers because of this. I can't remember a time during the film in which it really peaks and gets the viewer excited. It just meanders along with the detached storyline. It felt like a rushed piece when I was done with it, and the fridge gag? Just awful. Maybe they couldn't do much with the lame story they had to shoot, but I think that the filmmakers forgot that Indiana Jones movies are about more than just intense adventure sequences.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Examples: A box that can melt peoples face.(Raiders) A guy who can rip out your heart and somehow your still alive (Temple of Doom) Drinking water from a carpenters cup makes you immortal (Last Crusade) Those are ""SO"" believable.Acting is solid throughout even LaBeouf did a good job amazingly.This is a great movie and should be seen and respected by any True Indy fan and if you don't like this movie you are not a true Indy fan.Oh and the ending kicks total ass two words: Knowledge Explosion",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
923,madmax007,What Did You Expect?,6,7 June 2008,"For the fourth installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy Stephen Spielberg and producer George Lucas create no new innovations that haven't been seen in the first three Indiana Jones movies. For a film thats been in development hell for more than 15 years expectations are high and it seems that Stephen Spielberg is ready for a comeback as well.Because Stephen Spielberg being the multi-international blockbuster director that he is hasn't made a genuine hit since Saving Private Ryan.The Kingdom of Crystal Skull is only innovative to younger generations who haven't seen the first three to know that the story arc of this film which is replicating the first three. Shila LaBeouf was put in the film to create a familiar face to young audiences because the majority of them where alienated by Harrison Ford. The film itself takes place in an interesting time the Cold War in the beginning of the film there's much talking about the Cold War and how Indiana worked against the Soviets. However the arc of the story gets away from that and focuses more on an advanced Alien Civilization have advanced brains and crystal skulls that are able to control humans through psychic potential. The sub-plots focuses on Shia LaBeouf's character Mutt Williams who is Indiana's son through Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood. This film in a way is a retrospective homage to ET and Close Encounters of The Third Kind just because the at the climax ending of the film a UFO takes off after all of the Crystal Skulls are put back in place. This film does not offer as much conventional realism as the first one and parts of the film are all out of place. The film requires you to go along with the story like many Spielberg themed films you get much fantasy though a lack of realism but not to much logic put into the films. I'm a realist so I'm not to much of fantasy fanatic .The worst thing of all though is that this franchise or the whole magic that drove Speiberg to drive you in to its films is lost for more commercial and eccentric appeal amongst younger audiences. These people should step back in time and see what real cinematic genius is and watch the first three Indiania Jones films. So for those of you from earlier generations that saw the earlier films ""What Did You Expect""?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Although it does have one flaw which others will be familiar with from A.I. The ending feels like they ran out of ideas and strapped on whatever they could come up with. I was surprised George Lucas let the plot play out this way, and it feels like an all too familiar Spielberg ending. Shia and Ford make a good duo and deliver the story at the same level as the previous films.

However, with benchmarks like Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, this one just didn't stack up. It wasn't as gruesome as Temple of Doom, but it also wasn't as GOOD as TOD, either.Where you expect whip-cracking, you get joints cracking. Where there should be great one-liners, you see bad dumb-liners. And worst of all, where Indy normally searches for archaeology, here you get science fiction.The movie seemed to move at a much slower pace than normal, probably because Harrison Ford is just older.

It was a highly-entertaining, action-packed adventure into the unknown, much like the original trilogy, and I greatly enjoyed the film. However, the concept of the crystal skull played out to be a bit far-fetched. This new film simply did not have the same feel as the original movies. George Lucas had wanted to make a film surrounding the crystal skulls since the early '90s, but both Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford distanced themselves from the idea until now. I do admit that they did their research: the concept of the crystal skull is an actual phenomenon that has captivated groups of scientists around the world, and they were pretty true to some of the legend surrounding the crystal skull (but obviously, they took some Hollywood-inspired liberties). Although this film cannot measure up to any of the original movies, it still holds the same sense of wonder, dealing with an object with powers not of this earth. In essence, the crystal skull is a religious artifact, but, in the words of Indiana Jones, ""it depends on who your god is."" A highly-entertaining yet slightly far-fetched movie that should be taken as it's own rather than compared to the masterpieces created back in the 1980s. I highly recommend it :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It was so bad that I couldn't even explain why it was bad...... What were Spielberg and Lucas thinking!! It was like they just wanted to have fun and put in any scenes that didn't make any sense as a whole. Not to mention the disappointment I got from the film, but man I was disappointed by the direction of Spielberg(one of my favorite directors). The only thing that was good perse is perhaps the cap Harrison Ford was wearing and its shadow. Its as if they made a joke out of all the Indy films, they didn't put much thought, and probably just wanted to have commercial success while having pure fun and wasting all the money alloted for them. To think about all the money wasted on this film, perhaps more than 100000 good independent films could have been made instead of this one. Oh well, blame capitalism, and please don't watch this film, it doesn't have the right to be called Indiana Jone's.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
928,farleyflavors10,Brave New Era ...Same Old Indy,10,27 May 2008,"OK My first IMDb review here goes.Even with all of the time of watching the previous three films with total utter reverence it wasn't until I finished seeing ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" that I realized what it was that Lucas and Spielberg were shooting for with each of the films.I realized that they wanted to explore the legends behind all of the major religions and cultures in all the many corners of the world. In ""Raiders"" they explored the Judaic legends surrounding the Ark of the Covenant. In ""Temple"" we were given the Hindu legends revolving around Shiva and the Shankara Stones. ""Crusade"" of course explored the Arthurian/Christian legends of the Holy Grail. All that became invariably clear to me when I saw that in ""Crystal Skull"" They decided this time to explores the theories surrounding the origins of the Mayan Civilization. Many theories all pointed towards the ideas that the many elements of the Mayans remarkably advanced mathematical and architectural science was cultivated by aliens. These theories were heavily considered due to the blatant similarities between the Mayans and the Egyptians.As such It just seems right that this story surfaces when Indiana Jones is heavy into the Cold War especially since the 50's was an era where people were fascinated with the possibility of aliens. When the Roswell landing was still hot in every conspiracy theorist's minds, and it was also intriguing to me that the communists wanted to use the technology inherent in the science to spread their will across the world which blended beautifully with the proceedings. especially since in the 50's people were incredibly paranoid about the threat of Communist infiltration and the fear that they were spreading their philosophy under everyone's noses.It occurs to me that many of the new aspects introduced in this film were introduced primarily out of necessity. Firstly and most importantly, it's been 19 years since we last saw Indy, a lot of things have obviously happened between here and there and David Koepp's script sharply acknowledges that. We see that Indy's life and his legacy is hollow and empty most of his friends (and family) have passed on leaving Indy debating what he has fought on for when he literally has no one to pass it on to.It's with that in mind that Marion Ravenwood's reemergence is not only appropriate it's also essential to Indy's development. Seeing her again with their son in tow makes for a refreshing new dynamic. Now it's not just Indy we cheer for we cheer for the whole clan! The chase scene through the jungle punctuates that point because it was staged, choreographed and edited beautifully to the effect where it was able to direct attention to all involved and never once has you watching one portion of it and thinking ""I wonder what the other person is doing?"" The action is immersive and it's largely due to the appeal of all the characters involved.Another note of merit to this entry in the series is that it contains the following ingredients -The paramount logo fades to a mountain: check...gotta love the prairie dogs -Indy faces off with a tough guy who meets a grisly fate: check..I don't wanna be in that poor schmuck's shoes when he's eaten alive by ants. -Indy and Co. get menaced by a creepy crawlie: check...Scorpions and flesh eating ants. I'm curious to see what's next. -The main villain's ambition proves to be his (or in this case her) downfall when said person meets their end at the hands of the treasure: check... The human brain just ain't ready for all the knowledge of the universe.It's disheartening to hear people accusing the filmmakers of not sticking to the formula when it's evident that they have. They also say the action sequences are way too over the top and with that I wonder ""Are you guys really Indy fans?"" every single movie in the series had over the top action sequences. Surrounded by poisonous snakes and not bitten once? being able to jump broken tracks on an out of control mine cart? Destroying a gun turret on a tank with a rock? Those are just a few examples.

Fact is,i gave it 2 stars for 2 reasons.The effects,which were done at Skywalker which were obviously good,and the story,not the script mind you but the story was alright.That being said though,i do realize that this is targeted at younger audiences,but what about the people who grew up on Indy?I'm sorry i don't have the psychological disposition of a 3rd grader,and for what it's worth,sure,Harrison is in great shape for a man of his years,but Shia,if you'd put on the fedora at the end i would of just puked plain and simple.After all these years if they were going to bring Indy back they should've done it right with a script like Indy&The Stairway to Heaven or one of such form where in the end,well,it's the end.Period.Instead they just opened a door to spin-offs,which i pray doesn't happen,but since money is worshiped by more people than God today,i'm sure it will.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

He was a good man, one of the favorites of all my childhood heroes. When it finally sunk in that Mr. George Lucas and Mr. Steven Spielberg had murdered Indiana Jones, My heart sank. I went through all the emotions. First was unbelief, then sadness, then anger and now finally acceptance. Many people have said we cannot expect Crystal skull to be like Raiders of the lost arc, If that is the case, then they should not have made this movie. Just as Michael Jordan should have stayed retired, so should have Indy. I think it is an outrage not to expect the same magic and talent that the first movies brought. If we do not hold our viewing standards to a level that is beyond that of cheesy one liners and CGI cop-outs, then what do we have? I will tell you, we have senseless movies with terrible dialog and aliens flying out of mountains. There is never, and has never, been any place for aliens in an Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg, I know you are way into aliens, but leave Indy alone! You had your fun with ET and AI, stop ruining movies with aliens. Same goes with you Mr. Lucas. I cannot and will not even accept this movie as part of the Indiana Jones legacy. I refuse to remember him this way because doing so is crime to cinema everywhere. Alas my heart is saddened that the future generation will remember Indy by this movie and not by the greatness that is his original trilogy. I will do my part to make sure my kids know the real Indy and not this old man sell out puppet controlled by two alien dogma imposing wash-ups who have nothing better to do with their time and money then to ruin great films and murder genuine heroes. Alas Indy we will miss you, but we will always remember you the way you lived and not the way you died. Good-bye my friend.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
931,michielv-laarhoven,'Crystal Skull' fits with his predecessors,7,28 April 2009,"It's quite incredible that Spielberg gave 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' exactly the same looks as its predecessors. The vision of the camera's, the settings... it all reminds you to the old Jones trilogy. But there is a ugly, little stain on the picture. You can call it CGI or you can call it George Lucas. I mean, that stupid rodents at the beginning of the movie. That was neither here nor there! And LaBeouf who 'does the Tarzan' was simply crap.The acting performances were good. Especially Harrison Ford did a good job. His portrayal of Indiana Jones still was what it used to be. Also Shia LaBeouf did well as Mutt Williams. Only Karen Allen seemed a little bit too happy about her return in the Indiana Jones franchise. It seemed like she couldn't hide her smile.The story was very good in the first half of the movie. We had 'over the top' sequences, the famous Indiana Jones theme, some tension and mystery, booby traps and the scene where we saw how the shadow of Jones puts his hat on, was brilliant. But the second half was a lot worse. There was too many CGI, and though I liked the Alien idea, the UFO was really too much.The first half of the movie is worth an eight, but the second half only a six. So I'll keep it with a seven.***I'm from Holland, so maybe there are some grammatic flaws in it.***",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

And so on...So, why is it that so many hate it ? Well I think that there was absolutely no way that the movie could have filled people's way too high expectations, I mean... It's flawed yeah, but the problems in this movie, aren't really that big compared to other movies these days. Of course, compared to the original trilogy and how a masterpiece that was at its time, of course it's below, but as a movie, I say it's good.I'm not going to go into details and say why each of the problems isn't really one, because all you have to remember is that this is a ""fun"" adventure and don't have to take everything so seriously.

933,maxdetroit,We have grown up .. Indy stays the same,6,23 May 2008,"Sorry, but after reading all this negative comments, I like to give you my thoughts on this. When I walked out of the movie I was not really satisfied, because some things bothers me, like the monkey-rope scene and some other ridiculous and illogical things. But, then I remembered scenes from the first three movies, like jumping out of a plane with a rubber boat and then bob run with it down the Himalaya. Or Indy hanging on top of submarine and then swims with it through half of the ocean (isn't such a thing going underwater sometimes?). Well, what I want to say is that in the old Indy films there where tons of ridiculous stunts and it always was very cartoonish and yes, often cheesy. But as I child I liked those movies for that. They are just adventures with a lot of action, mystic and fun, not more.We have all grown up (with all that logic and reason), and we want the movie to fascinate us again like the first three did as we were a child. The disappointment is programmed. The movie is still an Indiana Jones Movie, it has so many running gags and links to the first three ones, it's truly a tribute to the fans. (Even that Indy starts Mutt to call 'Junior' was a nice one.) Maybe this one is too much of an Indiana Jones movie, because it just delivers elements that can be found in the first three movies too (the car chases, insects, falling down of waterfalls, e.g.) - but what else do we want? Also I didn't think the CGI was too much, I even found it was decent. And yes, this one was made to make money. The first three were also made to make money. Films are supposed to make money - so what? So, maybe just watch the first three again, then relax and just sit back and enjoy this one. It's not supposed to be drop dead serious and realistic. And when I look back, I wasn't bored throughout the whole movie, it was very entertaining. It's maybe just the long time between this and the last one, some things have changed, if we like it or not. But I am thankful that this movie was made.The only thing I was missing was the whip - it has one scene in the beginning and then Indi uses it never again in this movie. I always liked the whip, because it's not a normal weapon for a hero, and makes Indi a little more special.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
934,gonzosintheair,House 2,1,22 April 2010,"I didn't watch it and I didn't car to watch it. A movie came out in the mid 1980s called ""House 2:The Second Story""(1987). It had a crystal scull, was very funny and had its own adventure. According to the commentary, it was a favorite among children because of the western environment and references. When I heard of the fourth Indiana Jones movie had a crystal scull I thought to myself ""wouldn't it be nice if they made it a continuation of the adventure in ""House 2..."". Besides, the Indiana Jones genre isn't all that original. A movie called ""Cloak and Dagger"", made in 1946, was the original story. Basically it was a university professor recruited as a spy against the Nazis. His mission was to steal the scientist the Germans ""borrowed"" in order to make an atomic bomb. So it's a race for the power of the nuclear bomb. Yes, a beautiful girl helps him. So instead of a race for the nuclear bomb, Indiana Jones is a race for religious, powerful, artifacts that will give the Germans power over the allies.

935,supcuzz,Thanks for the butt rape Lucas,1,29 May 2008,"Geez where to even begin with this movie. To call this a fall from grace is a huge understatement. I, like most humans, was an adoring fan of the first three films and couldn't wait, albeit with a little apprehenision, for this fourth installment. God, what a catastrophic letdown.I won't bore you with the details all I will say is this: This movie just has NO heart and soul. None. Zip. Zero. It's an ATM for Lucas and Spielberg and they should be ashamed.Indeed, like so many movies these days, heart and soul has been replaced with CG effects and outrageous action scenes. They pedal this crap at us again and again and brainwash the public into thinking it's okay and acceptable. Despicable. I guess some smart person figured out that little things like story, plot development, character interaction, and beleivability (just a little even) just don't bring in the money anymore. When did this happen? Was there a memo sent out to all filmmakers around the mid '90s that declared this? It is unbelievable. Here we have legendary filmmakers that have simply sold out. A sad day my friends. Indiana rest in piece. My recommendation: Buy the DVD when it comes out, only if you need it to snort coke off of or balance a shaky table.

First, let me say that Spielberg should never have accept the script.The forced, campy, 1950s dialog reeked with desperateness Ford constantly over exaggerated every single emotion, including glee and fear, making one wonder what happened in the past 20 years. The whole Russian spy red fear that was rampant in the US 60 years ago no long read natural today.Laboeuf did a good job given his role, but his lines were awful! His character lacked depth entirely and was full of contradictions.Aliens? Really Spielberg? Aliens? So many great titles under your belt and you landed on aliens? It's ridiculous.And can we mention the wedding scene at the end? The forced laughter read as awkward and uncomfortable, like the actors weren't sure how much to exaggerate their emotions.

939,orjg2,"Better than Temple of Doom ?, yeah, right (Spoilers)",6,24 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is clearly the weakest Indy film I have ever seen, not the mention one of the most disappointing films in history. Many film goers are saying that this film was actually better than The Temple of Doom and although Temple of Doom was a dark, violent and bloody film that took Indy ""where no Indy had gone before"", the film was highly successful and entertaining. The climatic battle between Mola Ram and Indy with the support of the powerful music of John Wiliams is pure cinematic gold. I am currently reading Indiana Jones and The Monkey King, an unused script written by Chris Columbus, and so far, that script is 1000 times better than the disappointing Indy 4 film I recently saw. Indy 4 is not a bad film, just a weak and disappointing one, mainly because it contains elements that don't fit in an Indy film. Sorry, but watching Indy running after little green men, was too much for me. Indiana Jones and The Saucer Men from Mars was a script that was rejected because it was deemed ridiculous at the time, then why did they pick the ""aliens in the jungle"" premise for an Indy film this time ?. The good elements are Harrison Ford's performance, the concept of Indy's long time missing son, the main villain getting killed after miserably failing to acquire some god-like power and the adventure spirit this legendary franchise has displayed since its very first day. The bad elements are Karen Allen's unconvincing and annoying performance (she constantly overacts with unnecessary and inappropriate smiles and laughter most of the time she is on screen) , John Hurt uga buga caveman-like character and Ray Winstone's unstable loyalty and betrayal toward Indy. David Koepp's script doesn't help much either, I don't know why Spielberg keeps hiring him after the big disappointment War of the Worlds turned out to be. Spielberg is becoming a lazy filmmaker. Exotic foreign locations were a key ingredient to the Indiana Jones franchise, but no, since Mr. Spielberg wanted to spend more time with his family, he chose that over adding a powerful improving ingredient to his movie. The movie features no original music. Phantom Menace, Clones and Sith had original themes. Here all we get to hear is recycled Indy music; it is clear John Williams heart was not present in this project. Nevertheless there is a light at the end of the tunnel as the scene where Shia Labouf's character is about to pick Indy's hat suggests ; he might (or might not) become the legitimate heir to the Indiana Jones legacy. With a good script this franchise might do better next time. Cheers and thanks for reading.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The first three films were spectacular entertainments that absolutely captured a mood that was as refreshing as it was alien to 80's cinema. Like most opening weekend patrons, I was anxiously awaiting this film for months. Turns out all I can say is ""yikes."" Not a single element works in this film. Whereas Spielberg used to depend on the satisfying suspension of disbelief that is mandated in escapism, this nonsense is just plain insulting. There is no thrill in watching the implausible. A shot of Indiana Jones maybe two miles downwind of a nuclear explosion is not awe inspiring, it's infuriating. Though I do have to admit the mushroom cloud effect was pretty great. But regardless of the occasional solid special effect, the movie just wasn't there. The entire thing is shot like a Barbara Walters interview. The soft lighting is, frankly, oppressive. The script is essentially just one long car chase with no logic or story to guide any of the actions. Many of the action set pieces were either dull or laughable. Having a greaser swing through the jungle on vines while amassing a monkey army? Ending two major threats by flashing the crystal skull? It's just lazy is what it is.

I'll be frank, when I first saw the trailer (and oh boy what a bad trailer, I wanna shoot the editor) I thought Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was going to be a poor addition to the old masterpieces. But... To my utter surprise it had what I was hoping for. I had a smirk on my face throughout the entire film. It was a nice experience, I felt like I was 10 again. The casting was nice. A lot better than what we saw in some of the earlier films. You don't have that one character you just can't stand. I was afraid the humor was going to be ... Well... Outdated.. But it was funny and I'm usually very hard to please, humor wise.It was an adventure and a good experience. I bet schools all over the world are overwhelmed once again by all the applications for archeology.It's good to avoid people telling you anything specific about what happens in the film.

IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME, A WASTE OF MONEY AND I FEEL RIPPED OFF BECAUSE IF WE WERE GIVEN A REFUND, THE THREE HOURS (RUNNING TIME AND TRAVEL TIME) and COST OF GAS would still be a WASTE!!!!! I am surprised that the ""STARS"" involved with this movie aren't embarrassed.The story was terrible, disjointed. There was no chemistry between Indiana and Marion. Much of the ""comical"" visuals make it more of a comedy AND none of it was funny. Swinging monkeys?!? A huge swarm of killer ants?!? (it would have been witty to have a small scorpion bite her, but of course, then she couldn't show up again in the end if she got a lethal bite). A space ship?!?

944,waitingforgodot,Bring on Indy 19!,6,25 May 2008,"I suppose my opinion of Indy 4 hadn't really cemented until I was waiting outside the theatre for my friends to file out and the last few bars of the John Williams Indy theme were cascading faintly into the lobby. In these days of sequels upon sequels, I often think about the scene in Back to the Future II, where Marty McFly has gone into the future to 2015 and the cinema in his beloved hometown is playing Jaws 19. It seems sometimes as though we are living in this future already. Especially with rumours of three more Indy films in the pipeline featuring teen star Shia LaBeouf (is he a star, really? or did someone just decide that he's going to be the young person to put in new action films? I guess he's not too bad an actor) - the question is will they eventually get to Indy 19? Hey, if things go to plan, there will be a Terminator 6, so I suppose anything is possible. But when I contemplated the sound of John Williams' iconic score emanating from the theatre, I wondered if our current future really has a place for our favourite crusading archaeologist (perhaps I should have stayed until the end of the credits and allowed the song to finish so the bubble of the cinema could have been preserved instead of letting the theme intermingle with the reality outside the theatre).I think what bothered me the most about this film (swinging monkeys and alien finale aside) is where the other Indy films felt like they were part of their historical context (or perhaps as a younger viewer, I was quicker to believe the context), this one felt like the era was just something going on around the characters. Hey, here's Indy (or Henry, Jr. as he is called most of the time  isn't that weird? why not call him Indiana? That's his name right on the poster!) in a 1950s house that's about to be devastated by a nuclear test. Hey, here's Indy in a 1950s soda shop, replete with young toughs in leather jackets, young toughs in football jackets, young blond girls and ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" on the radio. Hey, here's Indy in a 1950s era Army vehicle. With a rocket launcher! Yay! Explosions are cool! I don't know if the film-makers could have done anything different really, but something about the historical context didn't quite gel for me.And that leads me to think about my overall reaction to the film. It wasn't really that bad a movie  there were exciting sequences (the motorcycle chase by far my favourite, possibly because that was the one least enhanced by CG), there were historical puzzles (though I felt like Indy was just figuring them out without bringing us along in the revelation, they were just solved), there was a good villain (Cate Blanchett is awesome in everything, even when she's hamming it up). But all these elements did not quite come together in an engaging way. I also found that when I was laughing in the theatre (my friend said afterwards that she thought she was going to laugh more), it was because of how ridiculous it all was. Perhaps I am unable to suspend my disbelief the way I once could. Weren't the other films just as unbelievable? But everything in Indy Upgrade 4 just felt like Indiana Jones caricature - here is a search for an old artifact - we find the artifact - oh here are the bad guys - here is that Harrison Ford charm etc etc. But really, what more do I expect when I go to see another sequel twenty-seven years after the original? Art? As David Lynch says, ""When you go to the cinema, you go into a world."" So I'll admit freely that for 2 hours, I was pulled successfully inside the Indiana Jones world, despite its flaws and my own (newly found) reservations about ever-expanding film franchises.

However, it DOES. There still must be some belief in either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg that lingers within me, using a stick to beat back the suffocating tide of cynicism within my obsidian heart.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't this the movie where Indiana Jones was a little long in the tooth and couldn't quite pull off the crazy stunts of yore? Wasn't his basic human frailty the reason he resonated with us so? We BELIEVED it when he single-handedly took down a truck of armed Nazi soldiers.Well, apparently in his old age, he's traded standard human athleticism for freakin' superpowers. He escapes a swarm of army ants tough enough to drag human beings back to their anthill, survives plummeting from three 200' high waterfalls in succession without grinding his 65-year-old hips into powdered Tang, ducks the same style of car collision that Stuntman Mike used to shred four girls into pulled pork in ""Death Proof"" (from BEHIND!), and... well, it involves a refrigerator and a nuclear explosion....I'm sorry.

If a little one stings you, don't keep it to yourself."" I guess Lucas and co. didn't want moviegoers freaking out and squashing the fairly harmless Emperor scorpions because of this movie. But hey- snakes make AWESOME rope!!!-When did Indy become a colonel in the U.S. Army? -STALIN WAS NOT OBSESSED WITH THE OCCULT! He had ONE obsession: KILLING PEOPLE! ""Who said I was obsessed with the Occult...? Kill them!"" -How does Indy become the Assistant Dean of the University after being blacklisted for suspicion of Communism and returning from Peru with... NOTHING to show for it, except for... FURTHER dabbles with the Russians? -What was the point of the monument to the late Marcus Brody losing its head as a car crashed into it...? It didn't stop the bad guys- it only made Indy sour. That wasn't amusing.-And how did Brody die anyway? Did he finally succumb to the terminal cornballitis that afflicted him during ""Indiana Jones And What Should Have Been The Last Crusade?""

For starts she is at the most a notch or two over Rosa Klebs, the soviet terror woman going after James Bond at the beginning of the last century second half. Other than her acting skills, Cate is a hot blonde with a great body and you would guess someone in the casting team should have mentioned that to the guys in charge. Instead, her character could have been played by Sandra Bernhard and you wouldn't notice in a show so overly charged with visual, sound and, particularly unbelievable stunts effects, and you're left scratching your head why they wanted to waste the extra millions bucks just for the hell of it. Now, for the rest, I's overdue time for Spielberg to stop using the same extraterrestrial dummies with no additional output than the ones he used 40 years ago. As for Indiana himself, well, he is and looks much older than his father did in the temple of doom and it's hard to swallow he can put up any fist fighting with anyone half his size, much less not taking into account the osteoporosis effects in the usual physical abuse he mu7st endure or the instant pneumonia he is bound to catch in this continued waterfall theme park. To me, the final wedding ceremony was a waste of time as it was his use of the trademark whip a few times here and there. I watch in astonishment his hat rolling around in the church floor for no plausible reason, fearing that a new brand new Indiana Jones was going to wear it to bring us up 20 more years of the over exploited character.

949,timeformime,Another far-fetched Indiana Jones classic,6,5 June 2008,"When I was going into this movie I had in my mind a preconceived notion of what I would see. I imagined something like the others I had seen fairly recently: lots of chase scenes, a bogus but intriguing legend more in the vein of ""IJ: Temple of Doom"" to move the story along, and ridiculous fun action where no one gets seriously hurt. At least no one we care about.I was right! This is another Indiana Jones, and how Hollywood needed one to break the dry spell of movies that take themselves way too seriously. Cheesy but humorous discourse between characters who've known each other for a long time is one place the movie cashes in on the series' long standing reputation. Plenty of fun action in Spielberg's classic fast-paced style marks a lot of the movie's actual runtime. Without revealing any spoilers, the story isn't too convincing (crystal skull? come on!) but is still very intriguing the way Indy explains it.Overall, great fun! A must see for any Indiana Jones fans, and even worth a viewing for those who aren't familiar with any of the previous movies. The latter situations is unlikely however, and if any newcomers do enjoy it I highly recommend the first two as well.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
950,Runelady,Expect Something Different,8,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull proved to be entertaining and a great addition to the other Indiana films; however, you may want to go into the theater with an open mind. This movie has a different over-all feel than the others. If you are expecting the nostalgic 1930's era films that we grew to love, you will be very disappointed.Indiana Jones movies are made for action, and this film provides plenty. If you're looking for a movie that is believable, you're probably looking in the wrong place, but then again, if you wanted that, you wouldn't have watched the first three films. The storyline and plot of this movie are a little far-fetched, and the action scenes are over-the-top, but what Indy movie didn't have a storyline or scenes like that? Remember Indiana & his father departing the Hindenburg on an airplane in the Last Crusade? Now you get my drift. The downside to this movie is that the relationships between characters were under-developed, Cate Blanchett's performance wasn't very convincing or intimidating, and Karen Allen's performance could have been a bit less artificial. Amazingly, Shia LaBeouf's performance wasn't that bad. I think the movie could have done without the Tarzan-esquire scene, but the motorcycle chase on the college campus was rather amusing. John Hurt also shines in his role as Professor ""Ox"" Oxley.Harrison Ford meets all expectations as he reprises his role of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
951,Mysticum,Hooray!,10,6 June 2008,"This is an absolutely sublime installment of the Indiana Jones series. It captures the feel of Raiders absolutely flawlessly, and anyone who grew up in the 80s is bound to cheer wildly during Crystal Skull. I've spoken to people who didn't enjoy this movie, but they all had one thing in common: no love for the original trilogy! I was concerned about Shia LaBeouf being in it, since I'm not a big fan of his. He really changed my view of him with this performance. His original entry will seem VERY familiar, and not in a bad way.A lot of thought has gone into every aspect of Crystal Skull. It is evident, I think, that Raiders is the model for Crystal Skull, rather than Temple of Doom or Last Crusade. And that's a good thing! Raiders of the Lost Ark is possibly my favorite movie of all time, and certainly my favorite adventure movie. Crystal Skull is now right up there in the Top Ten! If you're an Indiana Jones fan, Crystal Skull will not disappoint.Sublime!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
952,TROLLDADDY,Einstein's Theory of Relativity Applies to Film Sequels...,6,29 May 2008,"A 6/10 may be biased... Something tells me the Spielberg/Lucas(& Koepp) Director/Writer(s) combo should have probably quit while they were ahead. That something would be the fourth Indy installment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.As my opinion goes... The plot was OK, but at no point in the movie were you ever really drawn in. The acting was OK, but nobody will stand out for any awards, or mentions. The CGI was OK, but not realistic enough for most adult audiences. Based on these three points, one can deduct the production crew seems to have lost their edge plain and simple. No doubt I would have enjoyed this movie as a child; but would have grown up to watch it as an adult and would have been disappointed in comparison to the ironclad trilogy.Unfortunately, when it comes to sequels, the Theory of Relativity applies. Three excellent films will make ANY fair sequel look poor. Had this been the first installment of a series, or just a SOLO(no pun intended) film, the reaction of the populous would no doubt have been more exuberant, or at least not as negative. This may sound crass but I recommend this film to Indy lovers, and loathers because at the end, you both will have something to agree on. I digress; if there is a 19 year gap between sequels, leave production light off.TD",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
953,nfxstudios,A Rousing Adventure in the Old Tradition,9,23 May 2008,"In the case of movies like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, fanboys are extremely vocal and polarized in their opinion, and it's these fanboys that the movie's opening shot seems to directly address as the Paramount mountain fades into a molehill in the Nevada desert.Watching Crystal Skull, the first Indy movie since I saw a Last Crusade 19 years ago in a now-defunct theater (and 27 years since I saw Raiders in also now-defunct theater), a kind of ""small world"" theory occurred to me. The first Indy movies were made in the 80s and set in the 30s; while the world of the 80s was certainly smaller than the world of the 30s, both are almost infinitesimally gigantic in proportion to how small the world has become in the new century, where we get breaking news as it happens from the deepest jungles of Indo China. It's hard to imagine then, for at least some viewers, a time when a man could wander into the wilderness and discover something that hasn't been seen in 5000 years; certainly it's registered on everyone's GPS today, like every other McDonalds on every other corner.To me, that kind of sums up the challenge to getting into an Indy-type movie (I say ""type,"" because Raiders certainly did invent a new kind of action/adventure for the latter 20th century): how do you get back into that large-world mode where it is possible to get lost and find something that hasn't been seen in hundreds or thousands of years? Enter Indiana Jones, 1957, in the middle of the Red Scare. Jones, now a US Military Colonel who worked Intelligence in Europe during WWII, has been kidnapped by the evil Commies and taken to a top secret US Air force hangar in the Nevada desert to retrieve an artifact he himself uncovered some time ago. What this artifact is, and what the Commies want with it, is unimportant, although it does lead into the main meat of the story. What's important in the first scenes of the movie is how Ford and co. shake off the rust of almost 20 years. Ford, for his part, comes off a little stiff in these opening scenes, and perhaps plays his age up a little too much. It doesn't take long, though, for that light to come back to his eyes, and suddenly Indy seems 10 years younger, and the movie really begins to roll.While the first three movies played off the setting of the 1930s era, with evil Nazis and Biblical Implications, this new Indy moves us into the age of the Communists, fear of the A-Bomb, and interest in what may or may not be flying saucers and men from space. In this way, Crystal Skull evokes the mood of the period just as well as the earlier films, albeit a different period. To me, there's a sense of newness there, even if the actual film-making is reminiscent of Raiders in its pacing and action themes.I personally find it difficult to understand how someone can accept Indiana Jones facing the literal Wrath of God (the sight of which melts the faces and bodies of those who look into its light) and the healing power of Christ, and not the paranormal aspects of Crystal Skull. It's almost like saying you can accept a house that has a refrigerator, but you draw the line at a microwave oven.On special effects, I'll only note that for the most part, in any movie of any era, all effects look fake. It's only a matter of what kind of fake you want, and which kind of fake is more practical and economical to produce. Crystal Skull gives us the first dose of CG in an Indy movie, sure, but it also gives us the familiar desiccated mummies and practical explosions of previous outings. To me, it's a non-issue. The effects shots of the original Indy and Star Wars movies look no more real or fake than modern CG, they just look fake in a different kind of way. I don't think the effects shots of Crystal Skull take anything away from what is essentially the same old Indy in a new period of history.Ford once again fills the Fedora with (except for the opening shots) the same light in his eyes and vitality of character, and Karen Allen's smile lights up the screen as Marion. And, fanboys of the world, silence your groans, but Shia LaBeouf is for real as a likable, charismatic action star of this and probably the next couple decades. He's maybe no Harrison Ford, but guys like Harrison Ford come along maybe only so often.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a very fitting entry in the franchise, and perhaps the best outing since Raiders. It has all the charm, elaborate set pieces, and sense of wonder of the originals, while updating the historical era and look correspondingly. 4-stars, or 9 out of 10 on the IMDb scale.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
954,Snespy04,Entertaining yet so disappointing.,5,24 June 2008,"Word has it that my inspiration George Lucas was fighting to get the sci fi genre within Indy. You might have heard it from your friends or family but George Lucas fought hard to get aliens in the film. Well, he got what he wanted, that's all I will say right there. The first half of the film felt like a Indiana Jones film. The Soviets (Nazi's) were up to no good as usual and Indy some how always get's tied in with their shenanigans.This film by any means is entertaining but it's memorable just like The Temple of Doom, it's not good period. I sat there thinking I am watching Indiana Jones do his thing, I should be stoked but I wasn't. After Indy and Co. reach Peru where the Soviets are it starts to go down hill. Although there is an awesome chase scene within the forest which ever you want to call it. That brought back the Indiana Jones movie. In other words you're going to get a half asses Indy flick. First half is Indiana Jones where as the second half feels like the Star Wars prequels. Those were decent but it should never apply to Indy and Co. No No No No No No. Bad George! Bad!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
955,rob55-2,I good installment to the series,7,22 May 2008,"There's not a whole lot I can add that others haven't already stated, both good and bad. To get right to the point, the story was a bit lacking and didn't measure up (in my opinion) to ""Raiders"" or ""Last Crusade"". I place it in a tie for 3rd place with ""Temple Of Doom"" (my least favorite of the Indy films). I'm not sure what Mr. Lucas and Mr. Koepp (or Mr. Spielberg) were thinking, but they went a little over the top with certain aspects of the story. Case in point (and this is nitpicking) is the prairie dogs. The 1st time was funny and the 2nd time was just fine as well, but the 3rd time was a little too much. Talk about overusing a gag. The Tarzan / monkey scene is another that comes instantly to mind. We all expect to suspend belief to some degree, but the vine swinging by Mutt with his monkey backup was just plain ridiculous. Yet another example was the waterfall scene. One was already stretching it, but then to do it not only a second, but then a third time was too incredible. Lastly, of course, was the climax (those who've seen the movie will know what I'm referring to). I really wish they (the film makers) hadn't gone there. As for the good, it was nice to see the various ""Indy"" trademarks (the Paramount mountain thing, the plane flying / map thing, the trademark Indy silhouette) and references (the Ark in the warehouse). The story flowed fairly well without too many slow points and was entertaining and funny. The stunts and chases were worthy of an ""Indy"" film and the CGI was reasonably well done as well. I think I would have liked the film much more had it not gone a bit overboard with the story, but even Spielberg and Co. are not infallible. Overall, a 7 out of 10. It is Indiana Jones after all.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
956,Egamstk,"Good to see, for the most part.",8,7 June 2008,"I love Indy, and have loved Indy ever since I first saw the films when I was quite young (born in '85). Yes, I even love the much berated Temple of Doom, even though it took me a few years past the others to fully 'get' what was going on.After seeing a new Indy appear, I was absolutely delighted, but after seeing the initial opinions, I held off just a tad, and finally saw it today.Was it worth the money? Certainly. Would I see it again? Yes, I would. Is it the best Indy? No.I, like many others, am sort of baffled at the quite Sci-Fi approach towards this film. At the beginning, I was completely hooked. I even bought the new Cold War Era Indy and was anxiously following the film almost the entirety of the film, laughing and smiling.There were, however, a few parts which made even me, who had previously steeled himself with the reviews, sit and ask why they would put that in.The first is a thankfully short sequence where LaBouf (who's really better as Mutt than I thought he would be) pulled a Tarzan act and, I wish I was joking, lead a group of monkeys through jungle treetops while swinging from vine to vine only defeat the villainess at a critical moment. It was simply not Indiana Jones-esquire... There was no lovable clumsiness, no hilarity, not even a dramatic moment, just Mutt swinging from vine to vine with his small gang of monkeys only to appear at a convenient moment.The second could be neatly summed up as the last 5 minutes of the movie. I'll consider this one 'part', even though it's multiple sequences, because it's all so self-contained that it could almost be a completely separate movie. This is the infamous, ""What the heck did they do to the film?"" sequence that everyone else is rightfully bereft of praise for. If I thought LaBouf as Tarzan was a bit baffling, though still somewhat within my realm of suspension of disbelief, what happens at the end completely threw that line of suspension out the window.It involves an alien, with a very heavily CG cut-scene of the ""fully materialized"" alien that was more confusing than anything else in the movie. I know what they were trying to do. They were trying to bring back the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" moment... But it came off as something that would fit better in a Babylon 5 episode.Like everyone else, I have to say I am still baffled at why they thought that was a good avenue. It very handily strode across the lines of ""plausible"" to ""fiction"" to ""I haven't seen this since Star Trek"", and while Indy may have the touch of fiction/pseudo-fiction running through his veins, I agree with many that the ending was just a little too much.However, with all this said, if you take out that utterly brow-raising scene, you have a solid and enjoyable action-comedy. A surprise re-appearance by another character certainly had me smiling, and while the one-liners could have been delivered better (or maybe the scenes could have been shot better to go with them), they were still very much Indiana Jones.The rest of the story leading up to the ending is still within the realm of ""fiction"", and was quite enjoyable. Quite a few of the scenes had me focusing on the screen actively, and the brawls were still top-notch.I did not find myself quibbling about the overly-Russian accent for the antagonist, I lapped it up, actually. LaBouf was surprisingly good, and made a wonderful Lil' Indy. Harrison Ford still had the quirky smile, the looks, and it was great to see him back in action.All the rest of the elements were there, and everything felt appropriate for an Indy film set a few decades into the future from the previous. It was just that bum ending that had me scratching my head.So, since it held my attention for the majority of it, I'm more than happy to give it an 8/10. If they had thought up an ending that didn't involve Quantum Theory and wasn't so rightfully absurd, I would be more than willing to give it a 9/10... But this is still a very solid film, and I'll certainly be getting it when it comes out on DVD.If you like Indy, you'll love the film. Just go in knowing that the last 5 minutes require you to shut off the left half of your brain!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
957,Mandango,The most insulting film since Phantom Menace,1,26 May 2008,"I almost walked out of the cinema half way through this, I only stayed because I was hoping against hope that it might get slightly better. It actually got worse.This is about a blatant a money grabbing exercise as you can get, it feels like no effort at all was put into the script, the farcical plot ripped off from Von Danikens stupid books, the lifeless characters....anything. Like the new and equally appalling Star Wars films, they seemed to have aimed this at kids who aren't old enough to recognize crap films when they see them. Again the over use of dodgy CGI ruins portions of the film, when will Lucas et al realize that CGI looks awful, and insults the audience when its not needed? Im not going to go into the many, many, things that are wrong with this film, I think the actual Crystal' skull sums it up perfectly. It looks like cheap plastic stuffed with clingfilm, a cheap copy churned out because the makers couldn't be bothered to do a better job. Just awful.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
958,andrewpotter1-1,I liked it!,8,12 June 2008,"I, for one, am not one to be easily won over by movies with good CGI, and I am not a big fan of summer blockbusters. I loved the HELL out of this! I guess this all started back when I was 7 years old and the first movie I ever sat down and watched (that wasn't some children educational crap) was Raiders of the Lost Ark (which is one of the greatest movies ever made)I don't think I saw Temple or Crusade until much later, but let me just say that I thought Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls blew both of them out of the water! I am going to try my best to make this review ""spoiler- free"" The movie opens up (actually quite unpromisingly) with the Paramount logo turning into... a groundhog hill... A bunch of fun little ""bubble- gum"" teenage crap goes on for about 5 minutes, and then, In one of the most unbelievable sequences of events of the year, the Soviets (KJB whatever) break into (are you ready for this?) AREA 51!!!!!!! And from that point the movie takes you and does not let go. From man-eating ants, to probably one of the best choreographed car chases I have ever seen(well, more like a tank chase but anyways).I think any true Indy fan will love this movie, and it is also a very good tool to introduce new future ""fanboys"". This is DEFINITELY better than anything else playing out there right now.

959,sschlenker,It's almost simple fun...,5,19 December 2008,"...but sometimes it goes too far. There are some really well choreographed scenes, especially toward the beginning, and some well-designed sets, but it unfortunately goes into crazy-land from there. I'm not a hater of this one, because heck, there was some fun in it. So go with it, even in the ridiculously far-fetched scenes. I'm the first to criticize George Lucas, the biggest sellout in history, and Stephen Spielberg definitely has his flaws, but you know, it's good to see Indy back, and there was some good stuff in this movie, so I'm going to say, yes, it's sometimes embarrassing, but it's possible to watch for fun (with some exceptions).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
960,giren-ismaya,Only for people who understand the Lucas' universe,8,27 July 2008,"When the fourth installment of Indiana Jones series - The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull - came out in theaters in Indonesia, I couldn't wait to see it. But when I asked my friend who already saw the movie I was kind of shock when she said it was terribly awful. She said it was one of the most illogical, stupid movie she and her friends ever saw.Meanwhile, my dad saw the movie and he said to me that it was brilliant! Being confused of the two very different reactions, I chose to watch Indiana Jones myself. And I think I know why it raises such different reactions from the viewer. Indiana Jones - in my opinion - is a unique movie whose the original idea conceived in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' mind. Remember, it's Lucas creation we're talking about, the guy who brought us Star Wars series. In Indiana Jones Lucas is trying to make the story in the same paradigm as Star Wars' universe. But, in Star Wars Lucas made it subtle and sophisticated. In Indiana Jones, Lucas made it corny.The idea of the crystal skull and - SPOILER - the alien thing is one of the way Lucas and Spielberg tell us about the concept 'space between space'. The alien in the movie wasn't alien, remember? It was a person 'live in another dimension'. Sound too corny too you? Well, I told you it's not subtle, isn't it? And at the ending, when the Cate Blanchett character get burned because she knew too much is the picture about 'the ultimate knowledge', the one that you will looking so hard but when you know all of it, you'll receive the highest level of live that to live itself is not the important thing anymore. The 13 (13, isn't it?) skulls who ended being one is a symbol about the knowledge that actually only One. There's only One truth, One truth that exist in our world and we could receive it. But when we know the truth, do we need to pass it to another person? Or we could just keep it to ourself? In my opinion, the main idea of Indiana Jones The Kingdom of The Crystall Skull is not the adventure with jeep, the ants, and the Russian villains. It's the adventure to seek the knowledge itself. The movie was made specially for the people familiar with Lucas' work. When they understand about the 'force' in the Star Wars saga, the 'knowledge' in Indiana Jones suddenly become believable. I found this movie is good and entertaining. But I missed the 'subtlety' in George Lucas' stories.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I find this movie entertaining and will always be a good and treasured Indy movie. Now the actors in this movie are great, especially Shia La Beouf. The action, suspense, and humor is down very well and the scenes are incredible. The bad is what everyone is talking about. The script could have been written by a 11 year old boy. The use of CGI makes the movie not like an Indiana Jones movie but a King Kong like film. The idea of aliens is just plain weird, why didn't they make it into a supernatural type film? Still the movie is good and I hope you can check it out of DVD. Also if you don't like the movie then I respect that because everyone has their own opinions. 8/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
962,orjames7,"I am generous, but this was not good",2,13 July 2008,"I like Harrison Ford. I like the first and third Indiana Jones movies. But this was a complete disaster. First of all, Indiana Jones was a protagonist, not somebody who is constantly reacting to events that are unfolding around him. It seems like our hero goes from being captive, to being captive, to being captive. This was more of a vehicle for Shia LaBeouf to take over the role than it was a sequel. And what was with the opening shot on Harrison Ford. He looked at least 70. In the action scenes it looked more like he should be wielding a walker, not a whip. Another thing that bugged me was the misuse of special effects. It is one thing to use effects to advance a plot that cannot be done in any other way, but to use effects solely as a vehicle for some gag is pathetic and one would expect more of the film makers. This is is a waste of time, a waste of money, and a waste of some very good talent.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
963,bolt76,Not a ringing success but a reasonable watch nevertheless,8,31 July 2009,"This was a reasonably entertaining watch but it's hard for me to be overly excited by this movie, and here's why.The script is weak (there's simply NO getting around that, folks) but the actors do well with what they have. Ford is clearly game for the task.Shia is alright although I did get the feeling he was trying too hard at times.The fight scenes are OK. the motorcycle chase was fun but the action did become progressively less exciting as the film wore on.I was disappointed with Cate's bland portrayal.Clearly, the film isn't a ringing success, but does succeed as reasonable family entertainment.

Pinpointing exactly what went wrong is difficult to describe. Was it due to the fact that Indy and his original audience are a little older and wiser? Or was it due to the atrocious screenplay? Either way, what was served-up was simply pitiful.In one sentence, this is a film that encourages its viewers' to walk out of the cinema after thirty minutes. A disgrace to its elders that's not only far-fetched, but quite simply absurd.Anybody with a modicum of sanity should find something healthier to do; like the shopping or walking the dog.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
965,bryan-mccarthy,Outstanding return for Indy,10,12 May 2011,"I've never heard of a sequel that has been so hated and this is about a movie that is just as good as the rest in the series! I've heard people complain about the Gophers, Monkies, Fridge, and Alien, but the gophers and monkies are only there for a few seconds! What is there to complain about if they're just there for a few seconds? The fridge was a little far fetched but there has been more far fetched things than that in the series. Example? When the tank goes over the cliff in Last Crusade, it does not tell you how Indy survives while in Crystal Skull you can see him figuring out a way to save himself from the nuclear blast. Of course everyone seems to forget that it is just a movie. Spielberg was inspired by the James Bond book series by Ian Fleming, where the main character always escaped near death situations, that is what it's about. Simple as that. And the Alien? Was it that much of a surprise. No, it wasn't. It was in the title ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", did nobody else know that the Crystal Skulls are believed to be alien? There was loads of documentaries on television preparing for this films release. Was I the only one who watched them? The only problem with the alien was that it was computer generated. It's design was a homage to the B-movies of the 1950's and it makes sense because the film takes place in the 1950's.Everyone also seems to think that Aliens do not belong in an Indiana Jones movie. That is going overboard, the Indiana Jones film series is about Fantasy and Science Fiction. Did everyone forget about the ghosts, voodoo dolls, beating hearts being ripped out through use of magic, and a seemingly immotral knight from the twelfth century? But no one will accept aliens? People say that the movies focus on a religious artifact, but this movie was. To the natives, the Alien was a God, and Indy and his friends were returning the skull of the God. It's that simple.Everyone seems to forget what the film series is about: tributes to Adventure serials and B-Movies.Another point that must be mentioned is that Indy is still Indy, only older. And besides, Marion is brought back, after disappointing leading ladies such as Willie and Ilsa, Marion is brought back and we finally get to see the two tie the knot. However if had watched The Young Idiane Jones Chronicles it showed Indy having a daughter and grandchildren just making you wonder who he eventually married and this movie showing Indy and Marion get married was that big of a surprise even after it was revealed who Mutt's true father was, however it was not that much of a surprise since the character was made-up to resemble both Indy and Marion. Besides that, Mutt is a likable character and is fun to watch interact with his father, which caused Indy to become a more responsible character and to remind the audience that Indy is older and wiser.And now we have new the new characters such as our villain, Spalko. She speaks in an over the top accent that pays tribute to the B-Movie villains making her an enjoyable villain. She is also very capable and an expert swordswoman making her all the more threatening as she attempts to get the Crystal Skull.The action scenes are fantastic which is what made the movies so incredible. They once again pay homage to Adventure Serials and we get to see the Ark of the Covenant in one of them. Also you can tell that they include all of the characters and that the stakes are high as well as having one tribute to the Tarzan films of the 30's and 50's.To conclude this review, I must say and I know you will agree with me, that this movie is a great return to the big screen for the greatest Adventurer of all.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
966,keegan-liam,A very horrible movie.,5,8 January 2011,I consider this the worst movie of all time. I find it disgusting and should not be considered an Indiana Jones movie. What were they thinking when they made this horrible movie. Shia LaBouef plays Indina Jones' son. What? The acting was atrocious for the most part except for Harrison Ford. What is with these annoying cheap Russian accents. The Germans in the original didn't have them that bad. I am pretty sure you wouldn't survive a nuclear blast if you jumped in a refrigerator. Not to mention he banged around in it for five minutes so I am pretty sure his bones would be broken. The people in the temple made no sense at all. How long had they been there and who were they. It didn't seem necessary to the movie's already horrible plot. Aliens might not have been as bad as what it turned out to be. Inter dimensional beings. What the hell is that. Once I saw the CGI gopher I knew this movie was going to be horrible. What was with these giant ants? Once again didn't seem necessary. The character Mac didn't make any sense at all.

The Last Crusade, excellent father/son story ark (see what I did there...) and fitting *end* to the series.I managed to see The Last Crusade in the cinema when I was about 9 or 10 years old. That was in 1989. I therefor am a member of the last generation to have seen an Indiana Jones film on it's 1st release....20 years ago. There were no mobile phones. no video on demand and, most importantly, no internet. Since then we have been treated to massive developments in cinema, information technology and storytelling craft. The blockbuster as a medium has changed dramatically. In this day in age there are films topping the box office that have the influence of the Indiana Jones films all over them. They have up-dated the ideas and techniques for a modern audience.What I'm really trying to say here, in a rather bloated pros style is Indiana Jones has no place in todays cinemas or rather ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" should never have been made.For years we were told that they were waiting for the correct story or McGuffen to come along. Finally a story was agreed upon but, alas, Lucas wouldn't agree as he thinks it needs some tinkering. He tinkers and finally the others agree. The green light is given. The whole scenario has a ""quickly, let grandad out in the boat once more before he dies, I don't care if there's no rudder"" whiff about it. It's as if Spielberg thought ""F*ck it, if I don't agree to George's sh*tty idea this things never going to get made"". So he agreed and the film suffers.I'm not going to go into a break down of why it's bad...ach, I will. It's the script. Its poor, nay, its a mess. The actors are suffering. Ford is good as Indy but I kept thinking ""what's Indiana Jones doing in this film?"". I like the Mutt character and Marion Ravenwood is a good but poorly devised throw-back. Where's the scope? It looks like they never left the sound-stage giving it a bit of a TV Movie feel. The 1st films were full of awe and wonder. You just cant get the same feelings over CGI....yes CGI....they lied.Did anything good come from this film? Yeah sure. I loved the motor bike sequence at the beginning. I loved the bit in the warehouse...at the beginning. I loved the sense of nostalgia I got from the credits...at the beginning. But Indiana Jones does not belong in a fridge. See the opening of Raiders. Thats where he belongs.I really am painting a damning picture of this film. Go see it, judge for yourself. I might learn to love it on DVD but as it stands it feels like a rush job to give grandad one more pointless run before he keels over. This films going to be lost on the current blockbuster kids.Sorry chaps.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
969,luvsong4no1,"Indiana, may be down, but never out",10,22 May 2008,"I am a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series. Despite the fact that I was only one years old when the last film came out, I was taught that Indiana Jones is the only cinematic hero around.With his brains, brawn and overall awesome-ness, my brother and I began to idolize him. From dressing up as Indiana to stealing cookie jars and pretending they're idols, I've certainly lived the majority of my life thinking that James Bond is stupid and Indiana Jones is awesome.With that being said, I must say that I can see where the disappointment comes in for many of the fans. The plot fell short of cinematic masterpiece and the coming back of a hero after so many years of silence... was a lot of fanfare and not much of a parade.If someone was to ask me which one of the Indiana Jones films do I love the most. My answer would still be, ""All of them."" They all do their job of entertaining, very well. If you let yourself become lost in the story, the little things won't matter and you'll find yourself on another crazy adventure with everyone's favorite fighting archaeologist! It has action (lots of it!) and jokes, thus making it an all around good time movie.I give it a 9/10 because there is always room for improvement! Which is what I hope the next (I'm crossing my fingers!) Indiana Jones film will bring! The only time Indiana Jones will disappoint me is if our Doctor Jones was found sitting behind a desk with his hat on the coat rack for 120 minutes.Watch it! But just remember... have a good time!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
970,smvouriot,"At least its better than Temple of Doom, but that isn't saying much.",7,7 January 2013,"The very first shot in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is of a random CGI prairie dog coming out of his little dirt mound in the desert before almost getting run over by a car full of rowdy kids. Why is that prairie dog in an Indiana Jones movie? What is its function? It just doesn't have anything to do with the movie other than look cute I guess. Unfortunately, we see these unnecessary little animals two more times in the movie, including one awful moment when Indy and one of the Russian goons take an unplanned ride on a jet engine. They go flying down the track through the desert, while passing a pack of those pesky critters watching attentively. The shot just looks so silly and out of place in the movie(along with many others which I'll get to in a minute) that should have been left on the cutting room floor. Unfortunately it dosen't get any better from here.Throughout the course of the movie Indy and co. survive atomic blasts by jumping into a lead lined fridge without any sense of injury and radiation sickness, survive not one, not two, but THREE falls off giant waterfalls without any sense of injury, drive off a cliff and down a tree into the river below and, last but not least, one character even gets caught up in the a high tree and begins to swing through the vines like Tarzan with his monkey friends. He even somehow manages to catch up with all the other vehicles in the car chase before which, if I'm not mistaken took off AHEAD of him down the convenient multi-lane jungle road. But as it turns out, he catches up to them and leaps through the trees onto a vehicle. There are just too many stupid and illogical sequences in the movie that pass the line of over the top and into the realm of ""What were they thinking?"" Unfortunately, these scenes really bring the movie down into a deep hole which, in the end, can't really dig itself out of.However the movie isn't all bad. Harrison Ford has no trouble sliding back into his signature role and all the actors(yes, even including Shia LaBeouf, whom I don't think is that bad) do well enough in their roles. The movies opening is a lot of fun, which takes place in a large warehouse in the desert that houses mysterious artefacts (It's called Hangar 51 by the way). Indy is a hostage of the Russians but manages to escape out into the Nevada desert where he stumbles upon a fake town populated by mannequins that is actually an Atomic bomb testing site. The scene isn't really necessary to the plot, but it's probably my favourite part in the whole movie. The car chase through the campus and ant scene are great too. I also didn't mind the plot of the movie, which involves references to Roswell and aliens. The first three Indiana Jones movies had supernatural overtones, so the plot for this one dosen't appear overly silly. However, it all falls apart when they get to Peru.Before I finish I have one last criticism to make and that is the hit and miss CGI. Sometimes the CG looks fantastic (The very end of the film, parts of the atomic blast) and pretty dodgy (The gophers, the monkeys, the jungle chase, the fridge, the Russian car getting obliterated by the bomb.) Most of the CGI just has a sort of sloppy feel to it, as if all the ILM guys who I know can do great work, just didn't have their hearts in it this time around. In fact it didn't really seem that Spielberg had his heart in this one either, judging from the overall disappointing final product.At the end of the day though, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is still an Indiana Jones movie, which makes it very hard to completely hate. It's also slightly better than the Temple of Doom, but thats not exactly high praise. So overall, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull can't quite dig itself out of the deep hole that its flaws have put it in and its strengths can't overcome its weaknesses. It is still decent entertainment, but only if you can get past all the crazy shenanigans that Lucas and Spielberg have dreamed up, which I couldn't.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
971,the_cyberpunk,Jones Apologetic,9,25 May 2008,"I don't understand the complaints against this film, really I don't. It delivers exactly what every other Jones film promises save for one thing: Indiana Jones fighting Nazis. But honestly, Indy has had his fill of the Nazis at this point, I mean; the man rode on the back of a German U-boat, a Panzer, and he even met freaking Adolf Hitler. How much more Indy vs Nazis do we have to see? Also, how would you explain the age difference between the character and the actor? Ford has been out of the Indy saddle for 20 years! How would you explain a 58 year old man running around in the 1930's/40's when in film time he was only in his late 30's just a few years ago in 1936? No, I'm sorry people, Indy has aged, his world has aged with him, and it is time to deal with it.I've heard HUGE complaints about using Russian Agents as the villains for a number of silly reasons. What, the Russians are off limits as villains in action/suspense films? Oh, I supposed we'll have to phone up Ian Fleming and tell him to make some changes. I've read that even Communist Party honchos in Russia are calling for the film to be banned and for any actors or crew involved with it to be barred from entering Russia because of the way it negatively portrays 1950's era Russian KGB agents (as though those guys were saints delivering Teddy Bears or something, yeah, sure). What is wrong with these people? This is an homage to the serials of Spielberg and Lucas's youth! It is meant to be as accurate a portrayal of the historical and cultural nuances and intricacies of the Cold War McArthyist America as much as it is meant to be an accurate non-fictional documentary on Archaeology! What they were going for was the pop-culture era of the 1950's, and they got it right, there were greasers, malt shops, mysterious men in black hats, and nuclear bomb tests. What more could you ask for? There was also a not so subtle commentary on the how the McAarthyists and the J. Edgar Hoover style FBI witch hunts were indeed wrong during the conversation between Indy and the Dean of his university.If you are able to reconcile that the world of Indiana Jones had to evolve if it wanted to use Harrison Ford back, you will love this film. It delivers everything an Indiana Jones film promises: suspense, comedy, mystery, ruins, car chaises, bad guys, stunts, brawls, using a whip to grab stuff out of people's hands, a fedora, showing a montage of an airplane journey over a graphic of a faded yellow map with an animation tracing the journey's progress: it's a pretty simple formula really. They're not setting out to adapt a Cormac McCarthy novel to film. If you are disappointed by the fact that Indy is seemingly able to survive impossible situations I think you need to sit down and re-watch the original films along with a few episodes of Myth Busters. SURVIVING ANYTHING, ESCAPING FROM ANYTHING, DISCOVERING ANYTHING IS INDIANA JONES' SHTICK! Deal with it people! This is not Fargo or Goodfellas, only the bad guys die or get shot in these movies! Maybe people are losing their sense of nostalgia for classic characters, what with all of the ""re-launches"" going on. Maybe they should have hired an actor 20 years younger to play Indy, and set everything up just the way people remember it so that they're not challenged in the slightest to take in anything new and could just sit there eating their popcorn and texting on their cell phones. Maybe they should have just done a remake of Raiders with Vince Vaughn as Indy or something, I don't know, I'm no film executive. What I do know is that this film measures up just fine against the other films of the series and delivers everything I expected from an Indy film. For people who can't see that, I suggest chucking your copies of the rest of the series because if you sit down and re-watch them through the same filter you've watched Kingdom, you'll find those cherished childhood memories of an Archaelogist in a Fedora fighting bad guys and making amazing discoveries are gone forever and even Raiders is just an unrealistic and portrayal of its time with just as many negative cultural stereotypes.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
972,sir_clive,Just trying to make some more money...,4,6 June 2008,"A few days ago, I saw the fourth part of the Indiana Jones series in a theater. I went there with high expectations - the series, after all, is one of the most successful movie series ever, the Ford is still on cast (not replaced by some good looking but otherwise uninteresting bum like in the post-Roger-Moore Bond series), Spielberg is still the director... so, what can go wrong? Unfortunately, as I had to find out, a LOT went wrong.The movie not only suffers from plot holes/discontinuities big enough to put the loaded truck through them, it actually perverts the very notion of the Indiana Jones, an archeology professor with otherwise little interest in politics, by making him a freaking highly decorated UNDERCOVER AGENT with McCarthy views on the ""reds"" resp. ""commies""!While Indiana Jones has always been capable to survive even the most dangerous situations, this movie takes it WAY over the border of what is acceptable. The refrigerator scene? The swing-with-the-monkeys part? Sword fight against a highly trained swords-woman while standing with one foot on one and the other foot on the other car, moving through the jungle at a high speed??? That's just way too much.The villains were laughably overdone (come on, post-WWII Russian communists are really not interesting as villains any more, give them a break finally), his relationship with other protagonists in the movie is not in the least convincing, the jokes are lame and predictable, the ending is completely confuse and illogical, the puzzles are.. well, there are no puzzles in the movie, actually! At the end, the movie even paves the way for a ""Ford-replacement-bum"" in the Indiana Jones 5...To put it in a nut-shell, this movie is a sorry ending for one of the most successful movie series ever. Don't waste your money.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
973,NovemberKin,Indiana Jones and the fall of a childhood,3,30 May 2008,"I to did not enjoy the fourth installment to me it didn't happen, I just don't have it in me calling it an Indiana Jones movie. There are too many things distracting from the character and from the mythological character he has become.When I hear Janusz Kaminski was ""studying"" the cinematography style of Douglas Slocombe and that Spielberg had to make a movie like a young director again I felt confident that at least visually and acting-wise I would have been pleased.I miss understood what they meant by this, Kaminskis studying was more like an evident way of trying to cheat his way through the test, it was badly lighten I'm sad to say and you could actually feel when they were in studio. All the shots where very narrow unlike (maybe it was too much cost to make a bigger CGI landscape/background) the original trilogy, therefor you felt many scenes being on set rather then being on location.Spielberg directing like a young director, I guess many like me misinterpreted it. I thought he meant going back and directing like he did in his early years (which made the originals so unique and beautiful) but instead he meant directing like young directors now-a-days meaning relying mostly on CGI.The story was flat it had no depth to it, as was the case with the characters. The only one with depth in this movie was Indiana, and that's because we already had an established relationship with him from the previous movies. I mean the character Mac is supposed to have been a sidekick of Indy's for a long time, his traitory after the first like 10 minutes of the movie was blunt, didn't do anything. They could have, like in the original trilogy used a pre-adventure scenario where we could have gotten to know the character (Raiders: Mayan Idol, Temple of Doom: Diamond in Shanghai, Crusade: The Cross). This story needed something like that, instead we are introduced to Indy quite lately after Russians and the dreaded CGI gophers.Marions return was meaningless, in the movie she couldn't have many more then 7 lines, and even when she is revealing the true case of Mutt it does not come as a surprise, and honestly you just don't care.Mutt is the comic relief character that falls kind of flat, I don't care what people say he is not funny. They used so many obvious jokes aimed for children, the combing of the hair after his death threat, swinging with the monkeys and getting hit by branches at the crotch. He is very exaggerated and not evenly balanced as Marcus Brody, Sallah or Short Round in the originals. He does not feel like a greaser, rebel kind of a guy.Finding the artifact, the crystal skull, was so immensely boring...no booby traps, no excavations, no riddles and no real trouble getting it. Seriously moving an old corpse of a Spanish conquistador to get the crystal skull did not satisfy my after 19 years of waiting. Stumbling upon an ancient artifact that the Sovjets are after is not very Indiana Jones if you ask me.I give it a 3 just because Harrison could have pulled of a good Indiana Jones movie still, but was not given the chance. Making Indy go Sci-Fi was not the way to go. There are still a lot of artifacts connected to this world, so there was no need to go looking for space men. Done right the Roswell alien story could have been interesting to the Indiana Jones franchise though. But we still have places and artifacts like Atlantis and the Spear of Destiny to explore and much more.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
974,daniel_lalla,Just the most awful piece of dreck. This is why Spielberg is an overrated junk director.,2,4 February 2016,"Horrible stereotypical Russian accents (that keep changing and sound like phlegm)? Quicksand - really, a movie with quicksand... ? Horrible acting? Fake characters with horrible dialogue? Magnets that are only magnetic part of the time? Scenes that make no sense? Gunshots that should have killed everyone yet inexplicably never do? A Teen actor brought in with a plot device: playing a stereotypical 50s greaser? Double agent bad guys like when you used to play with your friends when you were 6 years old? Nut shots? CGI monkeys (that save the day) and ShiaLeBeef swinging from trees? If that's what you want? THIS is the film for you. How a piece of junk like this gets made is beyond me. Furthermore, the fact that it made 185 million at a box office is proof that people will watch anything. You can't compete with nostalgia I guess but this is so formulaic as to be laughable. There are so many good films out there and the fact that people even wasted film stock making something like this is incomprehensible. A story that phones it in from beginning to end. If you want to enjoy this experience, perhaps watch the Rifftrax version - you might laugh a little then. Spielberg is only 'good' at making spectacles. He could never make a nuanced realistic movie in a million years. He wouldn't know real dialogue or acting if it hit him in the face.

975,corpsebride01,"""it's not the years, it's the mileage"" definitely worth seeing.",9,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has most of the key elements that made the first three Indy films such successes and classics. However, this film is different, those who go into the theatre expecting another Raiders of the lost Ark, or the Last Crusade will be disappointed. Indy's journey this time is a little bit different, as opposed to the young, or younger man he was at the time of the last films, this time around, he's been playing the game for a long time, definitely no rookie. This element has upset some viewers, that there is less researching and more knowing, however, that is the advantage Indy is playing. He has done so much and learned so much that i find it believable that the character knows what he does without research. Also, this film is not as heavily reliant on history, this film includes aspects of science and supernatural. This should not really come as a surprise to die hard fans since George Lucas and Spielburg both admitted that in the Vanity Fair article that was released around Christmas time. regardless, the humour is definitely Indy's style, the film is filled with action, jokes and heart. Go see Indy on the big screen! Harrison Ford is amazing in it and you'll enjoy it, even the far-fetched parts!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
976,renato-padilla,"George Lucas, listen to Indy and go back to school (or just retire).",3,27 May 2008,"First thing, the good stuff about the movie. Harrison Ford rocks. He can portrait Indiana Jones even if he is a hundred years. Cate Blanchett is fantastic. She can do anything right, even if the plot is ridiculous. Shia LaBeouf hits the mark with his character. I was afraid that a teenager sidekick would be a disaster, but Shia does a great job and wins our respect. I give one star for each one of them. Karen Allen, Ray Winstone and John Hurt were good, but couldn't do better with that awful script.Now let's go to the bad stuff. Except for a couple of good chases at the beginning and the middle of the movie (warehouse and jungle chases), the plot is ridiculous (please George, leave the aliens for alien movies!), the rest of the characters are superficial and some situations just got a ""Come on!"" from most of the audience, like escaping an Atomic Bomb test in a fridge (Indy would have melted inside it and merged with the lead, ending in a Carbonite-like encasing, which would have been a very funny ending for our hero) or surviving a fall into the Devil's Throat in Iguazu falls, which brings me to the final criticism.George, Steven, you offend South Americans' intelligence with your movie, specially Peruvians'. As a Peruvian myself, I honestly tried to forgive your ignorance and enjoy the movie, but too much is too much. When Indy goes to Nazca, they arrive in Cusco and the lines are just there. Both names may sound alike, but they are not adjacent. They are hundreds of miles away. When Indy points Nazca in the map, he does it right, so why did you have to fly him to Cusco? A line to Lima and then to the correct location of Nazca would have been better. Next thing (probably the worst in the whole movie). When they walk through the streets of this Cusco/Nazca hybrid, Ranchera music is played. COME ON!!! How many times will you show your lack of respect for our cultures? Latin America IS NOT Mexico. Every country has it's own music and folklore; Aztecs, Mayans and Incas are not the same! A Huayno or a Condor Pasa would have made the trick (and please, not the Simon & Garfunkel version). How would you feel if someone made a movie located in Tel Aviv and the music was Egyptian or Arabic? Indy also states that he learned Quechua with Pancho Villa. WHAT? Again, the Incan Empire was NOT on Mexico!!! Again, let's go learn Hebrew in Pakistan, aren't they both in Asia anyway?The forgivable ones: The lines are all put together and there are stone ruins just on a nearby hill. The real lines are not that close to each other and coastal pre-Incan ruins are made of adobe (mud bricks), not stone. The burial method depicted for Orellana and friends are almost right, but the position is wrong and the ones that elongated their skulls were not the Nazcas, but the Paracas, a culture located in the same area but earlier in history. But these are really hard to know details that can be left to ""creative license"" (although not for an archaeologist, teacher and moreover, someone who is constantly telling Mutt to finish his studies).Finally, they travel through the Amazon (North of Brasil) and fall in the Iguazu falls (South of Brazil) more specifically the Devil's Throat, easy to recognize for ANY South American. It's like navigating the Mississippi in Lousiana and falling from the Niagara Falls! COME ON!You could have gotten away with it in the 80's, but not in the Internet era. A couple of hours in Wikipedia would have sufficed to correct these huge mistakes.George, it may be time to discreetly stepping aside into retirement before you do more damage to your own name. Steven, you must be really a good friend to direct this, so you are forgiven. Again, I give three stars, one for Harrison, one for Shia, and one very special for Cate.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
977,yellocar,It's...OK.,5,20 May 2008,"I am not going to go into details, because the trailer pretty much covers the movie. Ford is good in his role as Henry Jones and the supporting cast is fine, but I left the screening feeling like everyone was kind of ""walking through"" the film. The special effects are fantastic and there are some genuine laughs. This movie is a bit more graphic in terms of actual dead bodies, but predictably, the shootout scenes are straight out of ""The A-Team."" Lots of bullets flying and no one ever gets a scratch.

979,imdbuser11700,Indiana Jones and the something something of the Cyrstal Skull,5,25 May 2008,"From the first 15 minutes of the movie, it was so over the top cheesy, I expected to hear ""cut"" because any minute now, the lens would zoom out to reveal that Indiana Jones was doing movies because his fictional character had become famous. No, it wasn't going to be the case.And then for the next 15 minutes we are back in Fast Times in Ridgemont high in the 50's where Lucus is just doing his *thing*. The movie just continues on developing from a 50's diner. Something different I suppose. I am still giving the movie a benefit of doubt that it'll get better.For a moment when Indiana gets sent off on a rocket with wheels, I really thought Indiana was gonna travel through time. Did they really use the same prop from the movie ""Timecop"" with Jean Claude Van Damn? I know its supposed to resemble rocket testing equipment, but all I can think of was Timecop and traveling through time. Timetravel and Indiana Jones definitely could happen the way the movie was heading. Still hoping that things will get better...Then came the refrigerator scene...ask me to think about something unbelievable in a movie...and the closest thing to it might be that movie where they increase the size of a sharks brain and it becomes super smart. But really, that could maybe happen if you're really really looking to stretch. The refrigerator scene in Indiana Jones 4, no. Never in a million years. Terrible. When Indiana Jones gets out of the refrigerator, someone in the audience yelled, ""yeah right"". Which was what everyone was thinking. I think an explative in the tune of ""what the heck?"" would have worked just the same on the crowd.There was this overhead shot of this cemetery scene that is so obvious that its shot from a miniature...I really wonder why they didn't decide to redo it...add a filter...add some CGI. Do ""something else"". And maybe I realize its Lucus again trying to go back to the golden era of where miniatures was the hot new way to shoot. And he goes as far as to make it look extra *miniatury* so that people don't miss that its being shot at an miniature set. Lucus might have thought it was cool, but it literally just killed the movie. If a boom mic hit Indiana Jones on the head and they just kept rolling, it wouldn't have made a difference anymore. From this moment on, I am done making excuses for the movie and it felt like I was stuck watching a bad play.Movies are good when you get lost in the story and in the character's reality. And it should never break the reality the characters are in. You should never be reminded that you are watching a movie. But it was done many many times, and sometimes on purpose. Because I know if my friends and I can easily spot when something should be re-shot, a professional would have realized that it needed to be redone.Probably the movie wasn't too bad, but I expected A LOT more from Lucus and Spielberg. Or maybe it was really this bad, and if it wasn't a movie about a hero everyone loved directed and written by Speilber and Lucas of all people (and watching with friends), I might have considered walking out. It was across the board bad. The story was poor (pick a story about something that is not associated with a phony legend, and put some witty/smart/good humor that is the magical formula in the Indiana Jones movies). The props were poor (miniature set sucked, don't borrow from Timecop). And directing was poor (a lot needed to be re-shot and reprocessed, the acting was over the top, think Frau Farbisna of Austin Powers....about the same level of over-the-topness.). They have no excuse. Why do they do this to their loyal fans? I like complete collections, but I wouldn't add this movie to my collection just because its part of the Indiana Jones series.I wanted to more than like it. I wanted to love it. I wanted it to have some scenes that would randomly pop into my head (months and years after I've watched the movie) when I'm driving in my car, so it can tickle my funny-bone and lift me up. I want to be able to reference the lines like ""No Ticket!"" when I accidentally kick someone out of the car. Or say ""I'm sorry son...They got us"" when I accidentally destroy a part of the vehicle we're using in a team race. It would be hysterical because everyone would understand the reference. The Indiana Jones movies 1-3 had that. This one does not. There should be scenes where things are funnier when its left unsaid but everyone understands the reference. In this movie they seem to say it just in case we missed the joke. (knife to a gunfight. falling down the waterfall scene). Instead of Indiana saying, ""Sorry kid, but it looks like you brought a knife to a gun fight."" It is funnier if he would have said something to the tune of, ""We all know how this is gonna turn out."" with a smirk. Its not that hard to fix these problems, but they made no attempts.The hat scene at the very end of the movie is a good analogy. The hat falls off the coat hanger, and lands at the feet of the guy the guy that could follow in Jones' footsteps. As he's about to put it on his head, he doesn't get to. As if Harrison were saying, ""We tried to pass the torch, but after the end result of this movie, we've all realized there probably isn't going to be a sequel. I'm keeping my hat to keep whatever's left of my (and the series) dignity. Sorry but we tried.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
980,soukie,Fits into the Series,7,22 June 2008,"Although the movie was made 19 years after the last one (and 27 years elapsed from the very first) it feels surprisingly consistent with the previous movies. It delivers the light entertainment without much regard for what's plausible which is what I've come to expect from Indy movies.Don't be misled by the criticism in the comments you can read here. The people bashing 'Crystal Skull' and rating it one to four stars probably haven't seen 'Temple of Doom' for a very long time. When it comes to movies we liked, the memories can be very forgiving.I must say there were things I did not like. I would tone down the action and give more time to uncovering of the mystery. On the other hand, 'Crystal Skull' scores because it not only dares to tackle subjects such as A-bomb testing and McCarthyism, but does that in a way that does not break the story at all. Another welcome thing was the humor which is roughly comparable to 'The Last Crusade' in style and sophistry.Overall, 'Crystal Skull' fits with the other movies. Just make sure you set your expectations correctly. It isn't better than your average Indiana Jones experience, but it definitely isn't the worst installment either.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

OK so I didn't have much expectation of it; how can you stay serious when Indy himself admitted to getting old right from the beginning? After that it just turned into a dream ride... Like if you're in Disney Land. Afterall, whoever thought an archaeologist with whip can be an adventurer at the same time in the first place? I can only imagine the fun they had when the cast got together again to do all this. When it comes to old people, they get less serious and more fun and I really liked how they transitioned into what they are now.And for those who're edging for the serious type they got LaBoeff. What more can you ask. If you want another serious Indy movie (if there is one, to begin with), wait for the young dude to pick up the hat.And if you're fed up with aliens, just a reminder that the Mayan mysteries is ALL ABOUT ALIENS in capital letters right here. :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It's a day later and I just needed to give a warning out to anyone out there expecting a masterpiece. I find it amazing that this movie is in the top 250. I thought Shia would ruin this movie for me. He was a reason, but horrible CG, very cheesy one liners, actors talent wasted and a very stupid plot. ALIENS? ALIENS? Why? Spielberg is obsessed with ALIENS and felt that had to be involved with INDIANA JONES. Come on. And what was with the gophers? And the monkeys that attacked the Russians? And those crazy ants that look like they were drawn by a 10 year old.See this if you must, but heed the warnings of myself and people who compared this movie to The Mummy and National Treasure. Don't say we didn't warn you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
983,Movielover134,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,8,10 June 2008,"I should start off by saying that i have never seen a singe Indiana Jones movie till this one. I finally got to see this movie today, even though i heard bad hype and reviews everywhere i still wanted to see it. As i said before I don't know anything about Indi so when the movie opened up i expected a big opening, but we get and few cars driving through the desert to a military factory, why not just start there? Then as we are introduced to the villain you could barley understand what she was saying sometimes. The movie started off okay it needed a big scene that didn't look so fake to get you into the mood. We then go to the atomic bomb sequence which i cant understand why it was in here to begin with and he would have died, by the way.By now i realize trhis movie is gonna require that you turn your brain off and have fun, the puzzles were fun, but where is the epicness that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are great for? The movie felt cheap, and very unrealistic I wish it had a bigger scope and a much better plot! But i was enjoying it a little. Some scenes would pull me in and make me forget everything, then there were some where i just rolled my eyes. The scene where Mutt swings with the monkeys, when they went over 3 waterfalls, etc.Some positive things were the acting, and the fun, the plot was okay. The movie needed some sort of danger also, i mean danger and suspense. *Spoliers* I thought the alien plot was fun but the whole lot needed to be much much better and feel very epic and not look so fake! Overall the movie was good and the more i think about it the more i realize I like it, but i wish it was better!! It also wasn't probably the best movie to introduce me to the series?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

So it was with high expectations I went to see this movie last night, but unfortunately I was very disappointed by this one.I agree with what another reviewer said, the first half is actually quite good, but the latter half was pitiful. The problem is the plot jumps all over the place, and it relies too much on silly special effects and stupid scenes eg ants chasing after people and indy's son swinging on trees like a monkey to catch up with a car chase (wtf??). Not only that but too many things were forced, eg Indy's interaction with the female co star in Raiders (who was great in the original by the way).I thought Harrison Ford did a solid job at reprising his role as Indy, he was just let down by the aforementioned things. The movie was awful, and sadly is indicative of the action movie genre these days, where an obsession with ridiculous and totally fake looking ""special effects"" at the expense of actual substance is creating films which are absolutely mind numbing to watch. I wish they would just go back to the basics but I unfortunately I can't see it happening..I just can't believe that anybody out there could possibly say this isn't by far the worst Indiana Jones movie, it really is terrible. Be warned..",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
985,fable104,The worst of the four,6,25 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull falls short in reviving the Indiana Jones franchise. The film succeeds in dealing with Harrison Ford's age and the idea of the crystal skull sounds good on paper. But the storyline quickly becomes convoluted when aliens are brought into the mix, it would have been better for the writers to pick aliens or the crystal skull and not both. Old favorite characters like Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), Marcus (Denholm Elliot), Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery) are replaced with an annoying brat and a one- dimensional backstabber. Even Cate Blanchett cannot succeed in making the Russians original villains and they seem the same as the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Blanchett's character dies the same way as the Nazi villains and no really cares. Like the Star Wars prequels, the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull benefits from modern special effects that are absolutely stunning. But like the Star Wars prequels, the film declines as it descends into tedious fight scenes and stale dialogue that makes you wish for the snippy conversations in the first three Indiana Jones films. The film ends with Shia LaBeouf's character (who is apparently Jones' son?) about to pick up the classic Indiana Jones hat before Jones stops him. Here Spielberg and Lucas seem to be setting up Shia LaBeouf as the new adventurer and may turn the Indiana Jones concept into another legacy franchise, similar to James Bond. If this is what we can except from the new Indiana Jones films, count me out.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
986,firedude34,"Don't expect ""Raiders"" level of magic, but still worth seeing!",6,27 May 2008,"As many others on this site have stated, I intentionally kept my expectation low before seeing this movie. Good thing I did. The movie just kind of gave me a shadow feeling akin to a Dukes of Hazard reunion show. As with his Star Wars prequels, Lucas couldn't recapture the magic of the originals. The script was lacking... the plot was lacking... Only thing that saved the movie was the acting. I was, and still am, a huge Indiana Jones fan! My favorite was the original Raiders, followed closely by the Last Crusade, and in a very distant third: Temple of Doom. This movie lands somewhere between Last Crusade and Doom. I really really really didn't like Doom - with the annoying kid sidekick and fragile, delicate, whiny female interest. Blech. It pays homage to the previous 3 movies with some obvious and some veiled references to them. There is even a little Star Wars tribute (I got a bad feeling about this...)!While Harrison Ford has aged gracefully, Karen Allen has not. The tough as nails, drink you under the table whirlwind of a woman from Raiders comes off as... well... a tired worn out soccer Mom dreading the arrival of her first grandchild... Indy pays her a compliment and she gushes and blushes like a little school girl. Say what? It's almost as if Lucas and Spielberg threw her in at the last minute without giving her any advanced notice to ready herself for her return as Marion. Quick, someone give her the number of Ford's personal trainer! I liked the character of Mutt Williams, played very well by Transformers Shia LaBeouf. If the series carries on with LaBeouf taking over as the lead character he should do fine!I would recommend you see this movie on the big screen. No doubt about that. There is just something about seeing movies in a theater that add a level of magic you can't get watching at home.

987,seniorlimpio,One of the worst films I've ever seen in my life...,1,28 May 2008,"I've spent the last four days trading (sometimes heated) e-mails with all my movie-nerd friends over not just how bad Indy 4 is, but whether it's worse than any of the Star Wars prequels, which any true fan of the original trilogy finds practically unwatchable. My conclusion is yes, Indy 4 is a hell of a lot worse, making me thankful that the Prequels were even remotely watchable, considering (after the rampant laziness and lack of passion behind Indy 4) just how horrible they COULD have been!!! At least the Prequels provided a coherent storyline, a character arc, and absolutely amazing technical effects achievements over the course of the trilogy, despite clunky dialogue, implausible action sequences nearly beyond the capacity of its own universe (factory conveyor-belt sequence, I'm looking at you!), and an almost complete lack of direction (for the actors, anyhow). As far as Indy 4 goes, Ford doesn't sound or act like Indy from the old days, there's no ""arc of belief"" for him as was always present, the storyline is an incoherent mess, almost every single action sequence is so implausible that it transcends the possibility of even working as mindless entertainment, several topics and ideas are brought up, but never explored nor have any consequence, and the humor is a joke (no pun intended), especially compared with how wonderful the humor in the first trilogy worked in terms of comic timing, writing, and editing. The only similarity is Indy's costume and the music. I can't remember the last time I was so passionately disappointed in a sequel (some of our conversations have gone back to Beverly Hills Cop 3, Lethal Weapon 3, and Robocop 3 (man, what's with the 3's?!?!), and may as well throw in Blade 3 while we're at it. While Spidey 3 and X-Men 3 are the weakest of those series, at least decent junks of 'em are watchable (barring Peter Parker's ""dance"" sequence-ugh!!!) compared to the horrible, lazy, pathetic let-down that is The King""dumb"" of the Crystal Skull. Iron Man was for the most part a great film (outside of maybe some forced, unmotivated bad-guy issues near the end), but if The Dark Knight somehow sucks, too, I think I'm giving up movie watching forever and sticking with television- if you want some amazing writing, check out Dexter, The Office, Rome, Deadwood, and Battlestar Galactica which are leaps and bounds beyond what we're seeing in movie theaters these days.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I watched it recently for my sixteenth birthday in May and despite reviews, I thought it was a brave move to bring the whip-swinging, hat-wearing hero back into the age.Sure, Harrison is ageing, but Indy's age was reflected in his knowledge. There is plenty of action and excitement in this film to keep the blood running in Jones fans; I was kept glued to my seat with enjoyment throughout the film. Old wise Indy fans will be pleased to know that Marion Ravenwood, Jone's love interest from the Raiders of the Lost Ark makes a return, but may be somewhat put aside with the various Sci-Fi elements contained within the film.

This is just off the limits maaan! From the refrigerator to the swinging with the monkeys in the forest and the 3 waterfall drops this movie is devastating and is one of the biggest disappointments, even bigger disappointment than Star wars Episode 1 which at least didn't go off the limits.

990,Equinox1772,Excellent Indy Sequel!,9,3 June 2008,"CONTAINS SPOILERS - DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEExcellent Movie! This was the first movie that I have seen in years that I would actually pay money to go see a second time! And that is with gas prices like they are! People have been whining about how unrealistic it was for Indy to survive a nuclear blast, flying through the air in a refrigerator, the ""over the top"" stunts during the chase scenes, and the waterfall scenes. To them I say, as many others here have also said, these things are not unlike the things that happened in the other three movies.If any of the movies could be labeled ""impractical"" it's Temple of Doom...what with them surviving jumping out of a plane with nothing more than an inflatable raft, sliding down the mountain and into the water without a scratch, then surviving the waterfall drop...the guy being alive after his heart was ripped out...Short Round, a mere child, kicking and punching his way through many strong muscled cult guards...and let's not forget the train car flying off its track and then landing perfectly on another set of rails and continuing down the track! Come on people, ""Kingdom"" is right on par with the rest of the franchise in this way! Indy never gets hit with bullets or arrows (the bad guys couldn't even hit Indy AND/OR his dad when they were being shot at together), and do you know why that is (I ask this to all those who are complaining about this movie)?...it's because its an A D V E N T U R E film! The hero is able to do fantastic stuff in films like this.It's supposed to be a fast paced action movie where, yes there are moments of ""oh yeah right, that couldn't really happen"" but so what!? The other Indy films had those moments too! You still enjoy it because your favorite character is up there doing stuff normal people sure as heck could never do and the movie gives you the opportunity to let go and have fun for two hours. I think the people who are bashing this movie need to go back, watch the other films again, see how those were just as good, then come back and comment. Maybe they already did that and still hate it. If that's the case, the only thing I can figure is something about THEM has changed between 1989 (when LAST CRUSADE came out) and now. Maybe it's been so long since a good film of Indy caliber has been made that they wouldn't know a great movie if it jumped of the screen and landed in their lap...who knows...with all the crap movies Hollywood is putting out lately I wouldn't be surprised.Anyway, true Indy fans will love it!

991,mistaphill-1,"Entertaining enough, if you can overlook the stupid stuff",6,28 May 2008,"Of course expectations were ultra high for this. I mean, hell, there hasn't been an Indy movie in 20 years, so they'd have to but their best effort behind this one, right. Ummm , not quite.First the good points: Harrison Ford is still a good Indy, albeit an OLD and slower one. The special effects were pretty good, and the action scenes were fast paced and well done. Also, the movie runs under 2 hours so it doesn't seem like you're sitting at a never-ending time share pitch (the feeling I got watching the god-awful Speed Racer).Now, the things I didn't like: That kid really annoyed me, as a matter of fact most of the characters other than Indy annoyed me and made me not give a rat's ass about any of them. The title skull looked really crappy. There was a lot of boring and hokey dialog. The fact that Indy's Russian nemesis and her soldiers would ALWAYS find Indy (even if he's activated traps in a tomb that would prevent anyone else from entering it). The alien encounter toward the end felt more like a 30th anniversary tribute to Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"" then anything to do with this movie, and the wedding ending was just corny.Nice revival of a favorite movie hero, but misses the mark a bit.

992,ugyenpeljor,"Times have changed, and so has Indy...",7,23 May 2008,"Before I go on, I would just like to say that Indiana Jones IS my favourite film series, and that Last Crusade is my all time favourite movie of all time. Now, I just saw this yesterday with some friends of mine. I liked A LOT!!! For me, it was essentially the same characters of the 1930's era originals repackaged in a 1950's era dressing. Anyone who complains about this movie should take a minute to realise that it's MEANT to be a totally DIFFERENT experience altogether. While the originals were made in the style of the 1930's adventure serials, concerning Nazis and lost treasures, this movie is deliberately meant to show that times have changed, and so has Indy. Therefore, it's style is that of 1950's B-movies, and focuses on the 3 most common pop culture phenomena back then: the Rock n Roll generation; the Red Scare; and UFO conspiracy theories.Harrison Ford did not disappoint in his superb performance as the elderly Indy, and Shia was a highly enjoyable character to have, a street-smart version of Short Round. It was nice to see Karen Allen reprise her role from Raiders, and Marion is a lot less annoying and whiney then her 1936 counterpart.I'm gonna miss the Nazis! The Russians may look a helluva lot smarter and more efficient then the Germans, and Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko played a much more believable femme fatale then Alison Doody as Elsa Schneider in Last Crusade, BUT the Russians just don't seem to have the fanatism and villainous flare about them that the Germans had.My only criticisms at the end of the day are the: 1) Overuse of CGI; (2) Highly romanticized end sequence; and (3) the lack of the Raider's March throughout the entire soundtrack except at the end. However, I'm hopeful that these shortcomings will be fixed for the DVD release, or at least for the Special Edition DVD Release.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
993,neysa59,Are all of you crazy,5,24 May 2008,"Where to start. First I don't know who's idea was for this script but they need to be shot. They have finally ruined a good series of movies. I don't know but maybe this whole this was done to introduce a young indiana jones and do more movies. I predict that will last one movie and that will be the end of that.Making this movie involving aliens was there first and biggest mistake. The whole thing just went all over the place. Action, yeah there was some but nothing compared to the other movies. The other completely unrealistic stuff such as the nuclear explosion with him in the refrigerator and walking away without practically a mark is the one of the biggest.This movie will teach me. Expect the worse no matter what it is. If I would have actually read some comments here and found out aliens were involved I never would have gone to see it. This was the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT in a movie I can ever remember seeing.Don't bother going. Wait for it to come out on video, or better yet on TV. Thats all this movie really deserves.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
994,Trashcan,"When Indiana Jones became the Mummy, Stargate and E.T.",1,25 May 2008,"Hi,as many of you guys I have been an Indy fan for decades. I really was very skeptical when I heard they were gonna do a part 4 with a significantly older Harrison Ford. I also feared they would mess it up with special effects or would not be able to recreate the Indy Feeling. Finally I doubted they would be able to create a suitable setting in the 1950s as opposed to the 1930's before. So here the good news: All wrong! They made it happen beautifully and Harrison Ford was in top form. The settings and the characters, especially Karen Allen as Marian Ravenwood, who still has the charms, were great. Even Shia LaBoeuf really fits in nicely and helps create that Indy slapstick humor we all loved so much in the Last Crusade with Sean Connery.**Spoiler Alert ** So they really mastered all those difficulties that everyone was so afraid of and then, they (apparently) got totally drunk and decided they were gonna play the alien card. So while the first scene where Indy survives an atomic blast (he is right in the epicenter of the nuke) by hiding in a lead lined refrigerator makes you wonder, you really start to feel the joke is on you when they pull out the alien crystal skull. Then it only gets wilder and wilder. The jokes are good, really good and at some times you can feel the Indy vibe passing through you like a rejuvenation (at some points people were actually clapping in the theater). It's really fun and nice to see Harrison in full action mode on the screen. Still you cannot identify with the story or many of the characters. Whenever the Russians are on the playing field the whole movie feels like an Austin Powers sequel. The slapstick humor goes way to far (i.e. the gophers or the jumping with a car from a cliff into a tree and then into the river) so that you keep thinking how this would be a great scene in ""The Mummy"" but not for an Indy installment. Well but because it is fun and it is no doubt entertaining, you hang on, hoping it will get better in the end. But the end is really when you think that E.T. and Stargate where filming simultaneously with Indy. The treasure that they hunted turns out to be an alien inter-dimensional contact point (or whatever). The aliens (to whom the crystal skulls belong) awake and after they kill the Russian chick with an infusion of too much knowledge, they leave in their giant saucer into ""space in between space"" - Wow!You think I'm kidding? I'm exaggerating? - I'm not. This IS how high they actually were when they completely messed up this screenplay. I have been a Spielberg fan for all my life now but I can only conclude that this man has seen to many aliens in his sleep. He must be out of his mind to submit this storyline. I honestly cannot believe that Ford got on board with this, especially because over the last ten years they kept saying he would only play Indy again if the screenplay was flawless. I am totally disappointed.The verdict:What a mess. Its a real shame to see them ruin a legend like Indy. I will forever regret that they did this sequel and the toughest thing about it is how close they came to making it a real blast and how little it took to make it into this nightmare. Go watch it and make your own opinion. I know every real Indy Fan will easily agree with me. It is entertaining though if you can look over the fact that they are making a joke out of an unparalleled legend. So because of the good jokes and the fun factor I will give it 4 points. If you were to compare it directly with Indy 3 it would be zero points.Thanks for reading folks.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
995,rnakamur,Spielberg and Ford are two decades past their prime.,6,12 June 2008,"Don't get me wrong. Spielberg is a master director. Even ""War of the Worlds"" was impressive and masterfully crafted. The tracking shot where Tom Cruise runs toward the camera, widening the frame to capture the freeway blowing up behind him... that's ingenious direction. But that's not storytelling. Storytelling is the emotional quality that made ""Raiders"" and ""Crusade"" great films. Yet after the poor reception of ""A.I."", I don't think Spielberg is concerned with proving his storytelling to anyone. ""Raiders"" isn't just a stunt and set-piece adventure, it's a gripping tale of personal ambition. Indy is a young man yearning for glory, rigorously competing with arch nemesis Belloq. Remember his moment with Brody when he receives his commission to go after the ark. ""This is big, Marcus..."" he celebrates. ""It's bigger than anything we've gone after before!"" Meanwhile, he restrains his love for Marion, hindering his ability to act rationally... which nearly every man can relate to. (Did he really think he could save her by threatening the Nazi battalion with one bazooka?) Likewise, ""Crusade"" isn't about treasure-hunting as much as personal responsibility. Donovan shows him the Templar Knight's tablet, but Indy doesn't want to get involved... until he discovers his father has vanished. Throughout the film, Indy struggles with turning back rather than stop evil from obtaining the grail, while his father constantly urges him against such selfish blasphemy. ""You must believe, boy..."" Henry gasps in dying breaths.Now, think of ""Temple of Doom."" It's a sensational adventure film, with jaw-dropping stunt sequences that in many ways surpass ""Raiders"" and ""Crusade."" Yet it's missing something. Sure, he wants to save the enslaved children and stop famine in India. Who doesn't? But Indy isn't dealing with major internal struggles. Capshaw and Quan are fun, but the story, lifted almost entirely from ""Gunga Din,"" lacks the emotional element so present in the other two films.Now, almost 20 years later, we have ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" which begins wonderfully in a Nevada warehouse evoking memories of the finale of ""Raiders."" Blanchett is great as a KGB baddie and Ford is exactly as he should be-- old. After all, it's two decades since we last saw him in ""Crusade."" The sequences are routine, but the action is relentless, ending with a rousing sequence with an A-bomb. It's meant to be an equivalent of the idol's temple with the rolling ball.But after that, Indy doesn't develop. And neither do Blanchett or the less-than-masculine Shia Lebouf. Even when Karen Allen makes a welcome return as Marion, the moment where they discuss what happened in the last twenty years feels rushed. The plot, involving ancient Mayans, space aliens, and the legend of El Dorado isn't much to write home about either.One reason the earlier films were so great was because we loved young Harrison-- the tall, strong, handsome and intelligent hero-- who single-handedly takes on enemies against insurmountable odds. He wasn't Arnold or Rambo or John McClane who triumphed with weapons; most of the time, he used his fists. Girls wanted him, and guys wanted to be him. Unfortunately, geriatric Indy doesn't quite carry the same bravado.Computer effects also taint the action. The earlier films had an organic feeling to them. We knew that was a real guy hanging on to the grill of the truck or leaping into a pit of live snakes. Those were real tarantulas crawling on Alfred Molina and real cockroaches stuck in Capshaw's hair. But the digital Siafu ants are about par with the scarabs in Stephen Sommers' less-esteemed Mummy series. It looks like an effects shot. So does the wide angle shot as jeeps duke it out along a cliff. We know the 2nd unit cameraman isn't sitting on top of a helicopter. It's CGI. And it's not bad CGI... but the fact is, we just saw these effects in better, emotionally engaging films like ""Lord of the Rings."" Also, earlier villains made us feel like we were in real peril. When Mola Ram tore the heart out straight of a man's chest, we gasped. When Toht held up the fire poker to Marion's face saying ""Fraulein Ravenwood, let me tell you what I am used to dealing with..."" we reeled back. The lighting in those films by Doug Slocombe evoked the noir of 1940s Bogart films, using heavy, ominous shadows. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is known for back-lighting and smoke-- which worked wonders in ""Munich"" and ""A.I."" -- but miss their mark here. Cate Blanchett in full daylight is not scary to me. It just makes her look hot.Lastly, things seemed more realistic when Indy was pursuing artifacts rooted in history rather than myth. While legends of conquistadors are interesting, they are from oral tradition. There's no Bible, Koran, or Veda texts from which to draw it out from. There aren't paintings hanging in the Louvre depicting Francisco de Orellana. And I think that's why it's not so incongruent to see aliens derived from it at its somewhat comical conclusion.But I don't think writers David Koepp, George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson are to be blamed. All signs lead to Spielberg and Ford, who seem to be making ""Crystal Skull"" as much for themselves as they are for audiences. It's a reunion picture, not a sequel. We're just supposed to enjoy seeing them together on screen, sort of like a viewing of ""The Jetsons meet The Flintstones."" So in short, don't judge ""Crystal Skull"" too harshly. Spielberg still has talent. But if American audiences don't appreciate films like ""Munich"" or 'A.I."" I understand if he'll churn out sub-par popcorn fodder just to capture European and Japanese markets.If you want a real Indiana Jones spectacle, ""Crystal Skull"" probably isn't it. But if you appreciate it as a celebration of Spielberg and Ford's iconic collaboration during the 1980s, call your parents, buy some popcorn, and enjoy the ride.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

998,A4B4,A 1950s Indy,6,22 May 2008,"If you're expecting Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be a fourth in the series, you'll be disappointed. The original three were set in the 1930s, looking for buried treasure in a Treasure of the Sierra Madre style. The new film is set in the 1950s, and that changes everything.Frankly, it should be viewed as a new series. It certainly overlaps with the previous films, however most of that seems to affect the new film trivially. I actually think it's a little unfair to present this new type of film under the great Indiana Jones reputation, and however smart marketably I believe this, and the lack of understanding and inaccurate expectations on the audience's behalf will ultimately lead to the film's demise.The film itself is well written, and well made with only a few exceptions. As long as you don't expect another Raiders of the Lost Ark, you'll probably be pleased with the film as it is, with the exception of one sequence which doesn't quite seem to fit. Beyond that, the plot, characters and acting all fit with this new kind of Indy film.The cinematography is not the 80s style we'd probably all like, but it's not bad. The camera is certainly held much more stable than many of today's films, and the action is very clear and easy to follow, as is the stunt work great. There is a lot of computer animation--most of it looks believable, but some of it does not--but that which was done well fits superbly.The acting was also very good. I was very impressed by Cate Blanchett, and to my surprise very pleased with Shia LeBeouf's character and acting.All-in-all, I really appreciated the film as a whole, although some of the animation and action sequences seemed somewhat unfinished, or at least too difficult to believe (even for an Indy film). Still, it is an excellent 1950s serial, and I really hope we'll see at least one other Indy film set in this new era.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

So's the concept that Spielberg and Lucas were trying to convert into the new century.It's good to see Karen Allen in this movie, since she brings a little bit of the first Indy into this one. The action is well done and there are quite a few good jokes in the movie too. Indy looks old but still Harrison Ford acts like there were no time gap between the third and the fourth one. The CGI Action is relatively rare, since this movie is filmed and edited not digitally, which gives it a good ""old fashioned"" look and not the ""Star Wars Ep1-3 clinic digital"" look.That's all good, but the script really is awful. OK, the idea behind it all is OK, but there is no tension at all through the whole film. You never get the feeling that there could be something really serious happening to the characters or the world itself. The final sequence is totally ridiculous and it lacks of any surprises at all.For the action and the characters this film is OK, but it could never keep up to the spirit of Indy 1-3 at all. This Series lost it's innocence, which makes the first three ones worth a look again and again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1000,Sheldogg23,Storytelling replaced by technology,6,24 May 2008,"For starters, this isn't a review. I can't bring myself to insult a loved one, and that's how I feel about the Indiana Jones franchise. This film truly has its ""Indiana Jones"" moments, but for any viewer who is also a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, ""...Crystal Skull"" will leave you feeling similar to how your felt after viewing Star Wars episodes 1-3.It kills me to say this...especially as an industry professional who would love to work with Spielberg, but I feel like Steven got out-muscled by Lucas on this one. Lucas is obsessed with advancing the technology in the film industry - to a fault. Just tell the story please! We all went along with the suspension of disbelief from Raiders - Last Crusade and loved it. Minimal special effects, rich stunts, great stunt men/women and well developed scripts.George Lucas, who I believe to be one of the greatest ""idea"" men in motion picture history, just doesn't seem to care anymore - it was too evident in the Star Wars Trilogy. I'll probably be blacklisted for saying so, but what kind of arrogance leads someone to release films sure to displease an audience, believing that they're quality.I was concerned about this project from the day that Lucas rejected Frank Darabont's script, and after seeing Shia swing on the vines with the monkeys, I knew why.That being said - it's what I expected...however, Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones, and for a man in his 60s, the man's still got the moves!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1001,xtopperx,Lucas Lost It A Long Time Ago,4,9 June 2008,"OK, I get it. Spielberg directed it; Lucas writes and produces it. Hopefully, Spielberg will Never work with Lucas again... what a waist of precious talent.I only enjoyed seeing Harrison Ford and Karen Allen reunited after more than 20 years.The first two movies were beautiful, with no expense withheld to attain the right looks. I saw the Last Crusade when I was too young to understand why it sucked in comparison to its predecessors. Now it's blatant; Lucas is cheap. He believes his stories are just as good when he bypasses shooting at good locations, because it's expensive and he thinks it will be just as good with cheap sets and current CG, which is sub-standard.George, your writing, producing and directing suck; sell your franchises and find something that inspires you again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1002,warlund71,When it's written by a committee...THIS is what happens.,6,12 May 2011,"This was a previous review to my old user name, but I thought I would update it since recently purchasing the DVD and watching random scenes to this film...I really, really wanted to like this movie, but THIS is what happens when you get a script written by the Spielberg/Lucas/Ford/______ committee. A mess. Of course when the stupid CGI gopher is coming out of the mound right after the Paramount logo, I should have known that this movie wasn't Lucas-proof. Indy and Marion getting married at the end (oh, how original) and that Tarzan-thing with Shia was just stupid. But I liked the first twenty minutes following the gopher-incident, and I didn't find the extra-terrestrial aspect completely appalling, being that some scientists believed that there was a possible presence with E.T.s in the Mayan and Incan civilization. But the whole spaceship-thing at the end? What happened here? Well, enough of that...I found Cate Blanchet good in her role- she definitely wasn't miscast. Shia LeBeouf was all right, but I didn't think Karen Allen was as spunky as she was in ""Raiders."" As a matter of fact, this movie was nowhere near in the ""Raiders"" ballpark. I think that Lucas and Spielberg resigned themselves to the fact that Larry Kasdan is gone, and that their ongoing films will never spark the magic the first one did because of his help. And hearing how Lucas wants to grind sh** into the ground and have Shia take on the Indiana role (hmmmwhat a surprise) IS appalling. But the movie had its moments: aside from the first twenty minutes and the Ark accidentally revealed (was that the MacGuffin Lucas boasted about?), there were reasonable action scenes (with the exception of the triple waterfalls). But that's exactly the point: I could not fully enjoy this movie and suspend the world around me for two hours like I did with the first one BECAUSE there were these exceptions which seemed to occur on an average of every two to five minutes. Just when I was starting to get into the film, something outrageous or implausible had to happen. Instead, I shook my head just like my old man did when he took me to see ""Temple of Doom"" when I was twelve. Guess that's the Lucasberg way.The dialogue was nowhere memorable- just like ""Temple of Doom""'s, and this movie makes me appreciate ""The Last Crusade"" more (which ironically WASN'T one of my faves in the franchise). However, I liked the fact that the Soviets were the bad guys in this (and I thought that Spielberg was going to instead make it a group of renegade neo-Nazis or something). And the whole Red Menace-thing in the age of McCarthyism was another aspect that I found plausible. Indiana's character grew, but he didn't calcify, and that's what makes Harrison Ford the only man on the planet who can play this character.In the DVD interviews, Spielberg admitted that he was quite reluctant in making another movie-- AND IT SHOWS! He was giving George Lucas more creative control which was a mistake, even confessing how Lucas would ""humor"" him with the story. But one poster said that the movie was almost like a series of vignettes rather than one whole one. I agree. But with the first one, the wheel seemed to have been re-invented and I kept hoping the next Indy movie will equate to the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" But it never did- it just turned out to be ""the next one"" instead. So after three not-so-great sequels that were spawned, I think it's time for Ford to hang up his hat and whip before his whip hits him in the a$$ again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1003,JackTLovesJackD,Stephen Spielberg and The Quest for Money,4,22 October 2011,"I don't have much to say about this film that hasn't already been said... but I will say this. It was a poor film. Too much CGI, too much nonsense, too much Shia LeBoef (sp?). Indiana Jones looks about 100 years old and everything in the movie sucks. Watch it if you really have nothing better to do. If you want to watch something awesome put on Raiders or Last Crusade. Even Temple of Doom is a hundred times better than this crap. Apparently a review must be at least ten lines long otherwise it is not eligible to be placed on IMDb. So...

1004,angelaboyko,Not the greatest but definitely not the worst,8,22 May 2008,"I felt like I just saw the two movies. I loved the classic Indiana Jones movie, with action and humour and romance with Marion (welcome back Karen Allen!). I loved how Indy and Mutt interacted with each other, both before and after they discovered they were father and son. (And I laughed at the Russian soldier who had had ENOUGH of hearing of how Mutt came to be). I loved how Indy grinned like a little boy when he saw Marion again, and how she just glowed after hearing Indy couldn't find another woman who was her.The other movie, with the Red Menace and the aliens - I didn't care for that.I was glad that they tipped their hat to Marcus Brody and his deceased portrayer, Denholm Elliott. I didn't like that they also killed off Henry Jones Senior - Sean Connery might have changed his mind for a 5th movie! But that was at the time they revealed he had passed. After seeing all of the movie, I appreciate what they did - Indy was feeling lost and alone after losing these two men. By the end of the movie, he'd regained his friend Ox, and he'd gained a new family with Marion and Mutt. I loved the line about Grandpa Jones laughing in Heaven.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I have the box set & watch often!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1008,february2nd,IJ4 is unfortunately not what should have been a fitting end to the Jones saga,6,24 May 2008,"IJ4 was passable, barely, mostly because watching Indy & co. somehow feels like you are passing some time with an old friend or two. Ever notice how it's just not that easy to think badly of people you've known a long time? Overall I didn't expect much based on the lukewarm reviews I'd glanced at, and the movie basically delivered on those expectations. In a nutshell, there's a lot of stuff going on up on the screen like chases & bad guys & big hungry ants, etc, and it's a shame that the action wasn't driven by a plot that is basically impossible to care much about. So what is it that Indy is after now, some ancient alienized hyper-magnetized supposedly ESP-inspiring super-duper see-through head? It's been like 2 decades now & that's the best they could do?? Still, you hang on through the movie, hoping the writers might find a way to make the final payoff at least a little more interesting than it's premise, but sadly, that doesn't happen. It all ends up just being CGI noise. The only notable ESP event ends up coming from the audience who know exactly what the writers were thinking -- ""Hey, let's just throw a boatload of effects at everyone to try & distract them from the fact that it's a dumb conclusion drawn from a lame idea that held very little interest in the first place."" And whatever happened to solid characters in the Indy series? Shia doesn't exactly embarrass himself, but he held as much interest as you might expect from a character with a toss-off name like ""Mutt."" The villain gal tried hard, and even though I generally like Cate Blanchett's work, what she had to work with made her at best a 2nd rate antagonist. Jones's agent friend came across as no more than just a talking plot device to get everyone in & out of trouble. And the mumbly guy with the blank stare? Too bad the editors couldn't have pulled off a Costner/Big Chill on him & just found a way to mercifully leave his scenes on the cutting room floor instead.Karen Allen was really the only character who had a pulse, besides Indy at times. She was fun & a couple of their scenes together were the highlights of the movie. Too bad she wasn't in it from the beginning & wasn't given more to do when she did show up. (Though seeing the sparks she added did make you realize how joylessly flat-lined the rest of the picture was in comparison) I generously rate it a 6/10 for her, the nostalgia factor & the nuke. (not a spoiler, it's pretty obviously foreshadowed in the first 5 minutes) That scene was not only original, but it had genuine tension and suspense, sorely missing in the rest of the film.Note to Spielberg & Lucas: quit while you can & do not hand the fedora to Shia. Even if you took the idea seriously, what would you call it, ""Indiana Mutt?"" Even if if you didn't, you know that's the name disappointment critics would give it, so let the franchise rest in peace already.If this is as it should be the last installment, than I think it's worth offering up an Indy Series RIP to the memorable characters that helped make the best of the movies so good: The talon-capped guy with a beard (Elf Gimli in LOTR) who said things like ""Asps, very dangerous...you go first"", Marcus Brody, cool menacing villains like Belloq & the Chinese guy, & of course Indy's dad. A special honorable mention goes to the very brief but unforgettable dispatching of the knife-wielding guy.Too bad you couldn't have gone out on top but we'll still miss ya, Indy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1009,LK24,Indy's back and as good as ever!,10,22 May 2008,"What a fun movie! ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was just what I wanted from an Indian Jones sequel! Sure, it's a ""formula"" movie, but what do we want from Indiana?! This movie had everything we've come to expect: action, adventure, wry humor, good wins out over evil. I saw this movie at the 12:01 (first) showing in a theater full of 15 - 25 year-olds - all young enough to be my kids! It was neat to see how much they enjoyed watching Indiana and Marion - two heros, both over the age of 55!! Even more gratifying was to see a leading lady that wasn't 24 years old. Karen Allen was wonderful; I only wish she had been given more to do. Shia LeBeouf didn't disappoint; he is destined to be one of the great actors. While I've read this is the final installment, I'd love to see Mutt Willimas/Henry Jones III/Shia LeBeouf continue the saga.

This movie is exactly what Indiana Jones is about: humor and adventure.From the very beginning, the Indiana Jones series has been a huge popcorn movie : fun, fun and fun... its ambition has always been to be 2 hours of pure fun, a two hour ride on a roller coaster...AND that's exactly what it is ... fun and ride, adventure and love and of course it's not believable, of course it's not an essay on the subcultural phenomenon of the great Aztecs... but who cares ? if you want to spend a good time and if you're ready to leave all your expectations at the entrance of the theater and really give it a try you'll enjoy it as much as I did...Good Job !",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1011,prometheus99,"Should have been called ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Suckage""",5,26 May 2008,"Bad flick. Really. The first part of the movie feels like an Indiana Jones movie because it revisited themes and visual cues from at least two of the films. After that, it gets dull. There's no sense of urgency with the plot, except that if they don't move fast enough, a very attractive Cate Blanchett will get them. The ending, which I won't spoil here, is ridiculous.Plus, you've got Shia LaBeouf, who looks like he just walked out of a math class, playing this 50s style greaser. He doesn't look nor sound the part, rather like some discarded extra from The Outsiders, meant to remind people of the era the film takes place in.I'm not going to say that Lucas and Spielburg have dumped all over our childhood memories, because they haven't; I've got the three good Indy films in my collection and if I feel like watching a solid film, I'll sit down to Raiders.This movie is merely a cash cow; and what a cash cow it will be.So, to conclude, I would wait until it's on video and rent it, and not see it at the theatre. It's still better than The Mummy Returns.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1012,kevintuma,The Old Man Still Has What it Takes...,8,3 June 2008,"I saw this film today, and I was amazed at how good it was--it lives up to the series.Yes, it is full of ridiculous stunts that stretch plausibility to the limit--so were the three films before it. Yes, there is still too much CGI in it despite Spielberg's promise that most of it was live stunt action. (This proves, at least, that Spielberg is in touch with younger audiences--who have collectively hated CGI since the first appearance of Jar Jar Binks.) And yes, it did get carried away at times...the giant ant scenes and the ridiculous mobile sword fight with Shia almost did the film in.But in the end, Spielberg vindicated himself; it was Spielberg--and not Ford--who needed to prove that an old duffer ""still has what it takes"", and he did so very well. Spielberg has been making both artsy, pretentious films and utter stinkers simultaneously in the nineteen years since 'Last Crusade', and after 'War of the Worlds', it looked an awful lot like he had lost the ability to create a good action film. Since good action films were what made Spielberg a celebrity in the first place, this was a depressing irony. Fortunately, in Crystal Skull, Spielberg seems to have pulled out of his malaise.Of all the Indy films, this one was most like a modernized 1930s Saturday morning serial. Critics who ""expected more"" misunderstand the essence of an Indy film. Will there be another sequel? I hope so.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1013,windcriesmary,A Trip Down Memory Lane,10,23 May 2008,"I've been debating all day today about whether or not I should get online and write about Indy IV. At first I didn't even want to attempt to try to describe my experience, fearing that any words would fall short in perfectly describing the way I felt. Even now, I'm almost certain I won't be able to do so. I decided though, that I should at least try.I was only present on this earth when ""The Last Crusade"" was released, but I was far too young to get into Indy. When I was a bit older, however (maybe about 7 years old), my dad introduced me to the classic series by taking me to a midnight showing of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". From that point on, I was hooked on Indiana Jones. I forced my parents to buy me VHS copies of all three movies, and you'd better believe that my dad and I were back for ""Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade"" when they showed at midnight as well. Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr. was my hero, the biggest hero I'd ever known. Even in the years to come, the years that brought reincarnations of Batman, Spiderman, and Superman, no one ever compared to Indy. I was fascinated by him. When my family visited Disneyland one year, I found myself racing first to the Indiana Jones ride, and then forking out my hard earned allowance to buy as much Indy stuff that I could from the gift shop. My dad bought me the fedora, I eventually acquired a real bull whip, and even at my young age, I was browsing the internet for memorabilia.When I first heard that Indy IV had officially begun filming, I felt a certain surge of excitement in realizing that I was going to be able to take part in the opening of a new Indiana Jones adventure. Almost every day from that point on began with an almost ceremonial glance around the internet for news. I followed production as close as, if not closer than, everyone else who claimed to be Indy's #1 fan.As it got closer to release time, however, I backed away, only allowing myself to look at new photos, posters, and trailers. As carefree as I usually am about spoilers, I absolutely did not want to be spoiled with this film. I wanted it to feel like how it must have felt for those that fell in love with ""Raiders"" and then one night, saw a trailer for ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". I wanted it to feel like how it must have felt for those people to only have that one night of preview, and no internet or other means of glimpsing into the film before it was released. So, I bought my advance tickets, invited my dad to join me once again for Indy at midnight, and left it alone.Sitting in that theater last night, my heart began to race. It was hard to believe I was there, that I was about to enter a realm of moviegoers defined by the fact that they were one of the first to see ""the new Indy film"". And then it began. At times, I had goosebumps. At other times, I fought back tears that confused me at first, but that I later understood to be simply tears of euphoria. All the classic Indy stuff was there, and I never felt my face stop smiling for the entire two hours and four minutes.I don't think it really hit me though until the Raiders March kicked in, and the credits began to roll. To me, a kid that had literally grown up with and idolized Indy, it was the perfect movie experience. I wouldn't have changed a thing about it.This morning, I was scared to death to read what other people thought about it. It felt like Harrison Ford, Spielberg, Lucas, and the entire Indiana Jones legacy was my family, and I just didn't want a single person talking bad about them. I know some people will love it, and others will hate it. No matter what the movie, that's how it'll always be. My best friend has never seen a single Indy movie, and when I began to describe the main storyline for ""Raiders"" he said, ""That sounds stupid"". But even so, I feel like nothing would ever be able to take away from my perfect Indiana Jones experience. It made me feel like a kid again. I think we all need something that makes us feel like that. In a world that gets more depressing and tough every single day, we need something, anything to take us back to an age of innocence, wonder, adventure.And that, for me, came in the form of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.10/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1014,tillc,Spielberg & Lucas Stick to the Formula for Indy IV,7,28 May 2008,"As the first images of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull washed over me, I felt like I was revisiting an old friend in that old familiar place that I hadn't seen in quite some time. For the fourth Indy installment, Spielberg and Lucas stuck to a formula that proved successful for the previous three films, and I felt it worked once again - despite the almost 20 year gap between The Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Fans who go in to this film expecting a completely different style and formula will certainly be disappointed. I left the theatre, however, having thoroughly enjoyed the adventure.In this Indiana outing, 19 years have past since The Last Crusade, placing this movie in the year 1957 - right at the height of the Cold War and the Communist scare. Indiana must now go toe to toe not with Nazis, but with a group of Russians hell bent on finding an ancient and mysterious crystal skull - which they believe will give the 'ole Soviet Union an upper hand in the quest for world dominance. Indiana Jones, of course, is there every step of the way to thwart their efforts. Spielberg wastes no time in getting to the action, as Indiana is already captured when the film opens. What he doesn't know is what exactly the Russians are looking for and why they want it. As the story progresses he begins to believe in the power that the legendary skull possesses.The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull features many of the familiar elements from the previous three films. Indy sabotages a Russian convoy, much like in Raiders of the Lost Ark. He searches for clues in old tombs, like in The Last Crusade. He explores an ancient, tribal civilization, like in The Temple of Doom. He runs into snakes, killer ants, and other dangerous predators. So, there are moments from all three films peppered throughout the fourth, making it a typical Indiana Jones adventure. The downside of this approach is that viewers might find it a little too familiar, thinking, ""Hey, I've seen all this before."" It all depends on what you're expecting when you enter the theatre.After a 19 year absence from the hat and whip, Harrison Ford does a surprisingly good job of recapturing the character and the essence of Indiana Jones. He's older, yes, but he's still in good shape and he still looks the part. The same charm is there, along with the same dry wit. But there's a bit of an edge to the character now. He's a little more crusty and grumpy, and at times the mannerisms of his dad, Henry Jones, Sr. show through. Ford manages a nice balance between the two. Karen Allen reprises her role as Marion Ravenwood from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but she doesn't quite have the same spunk or spirit from the original movie. Cate Blanchett takes her turn as the villain, playing evil Communist Irina Spalko. Her character is more threatening than Beloq from Raiders, but much less threatening than Mola Ram from The Temple of Doom. So, it's a nice balance, but the story is somewhat limiting for Blanchett, whose character is reduced more to a stereotype who likes to brandish her sword a lot.Many Indy purists might be disappointed to learn that there are CGI effects in the movie, but most of the effects are still practical. The actual number of CGI shots in the film are very minimal and they fit in with the rest of the set pieces great. So, if you find yourself griping about the CGI effects in this movie, just take a look at Spiderman sometime, which looked more like a video game than a movie.One of the shortcomings of Indy IV lies with the plot. This story seemed much more straightforward than the previous films, with very little turns or twists to hold the audience's interest. The writers simply steered a course straight from point ""A"" to point ""B"" and then blew stuff up in the middle. It seemed that the plot followed a certain repetitive pattern: Indy and his pals get captured. Indy and his pals escape. A chase ensues. Indy and his pals are recaptured. No, wait, they escaped again. The first three films were special because there were more plot turns and more subplots throughout the story.Despite its shortcomings, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull marks another great outing for the famed archaeologist, and one that audiences shouldn't miss. It was fun and exciting, and the two hours I spent in the theatre simply flew by.Read more at http://FrameRate.blog.com",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1015,earnes,Good start.... and then it went down the drain,3,22 June 2008,"*** WARNING THIS COMMENT CONTAINS A LOT OF SPOILERS ***First I need to say that I love the ""Indy""-Merchandise and I am willing to accept a lot before I turn my back on it... but this movie made squirm in my seat more than once in utter disbelief of just how thoughtless the prominent makers of this movie treated their aging main character.OK, more into detail: 1. I liked the way this movie took of. I seemed sort of credible... until the moment, when the Russians appear....2. From this point on disappointment grew rapidly. Some facts that I just couldn't get over: - Top Secret installation, Area 51, stuffed to the roof with artifacts (also one from an earlier and better Indy movie)... is guarded by some dumb geeks who salute a walking uniform... and they were the only line of defense for all those secrets... wow, poor USA...Alien Magnetism... OK, I can accept that in defiance of reality this ""alien"" magnetism seems to have chance its physical concept continuously... sometimes its strong, sometimes weak, sometimes it attracts gold but ignores belt buckles or knifes... quite a selective magnetism... a little too much for my taste - Indy - GODLIKE The franchise always walked a thin line between reality, fantasy and fun. Earlier installations handled that quite well. This one doesn't. Surviving a nuclear blast in a lead lined fridge... LOL... is ridiculous for three reasons: a) lead may ward of a LITTLE radiation but OK, I can accept that this wonder lead warded off more. b) Lead does melt in the heat of a candle... now wasn't there some heat involved in this explosion? OK.... but c) being thrown miles in an refrigerator and coming out of there unharmed to watch the nice mushroom cloud.... AAAAAAHHHHHH. Where they drunk when they wrote this??? A nuclear shelter, slipping into the remains of an Alien Spaceship ANYTHING would have been better than that.... Indy is cool because he is NOT a superhero (remember, he even uses a gun instead of his whip when some freaky guy wants to kill him... he is inventive, not invincible) - To keep the long story short... it went on like this. ""Hi Ex-Wife, haven't seen you in a while (your whole life), let's fall in love again, OK? OK!"", beyond gravity (barely slipping out of your boat when going down a waterfall), the Mack friend-foe-friend-foe... changes, he's kind of the joker in this poor script, Russians can't shoot... Indy and family do not even need to duck the bullets... and so on - The riddles Indy had too solve were so boring. Hell time has moved on since the last movie. We have seen TV-Shows that were more inventive than this...All in all this movie was a real disappointment. Too violent to watch with kids and too stupid to watch for grown ups - it can be regarded a total waste of money.I'll got to the store now and rent the Adventures of young Indiana Jones... and that says it all.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Expository dialog out the YANG and none of it any good, the same old graphics of the plane flying to Peru or the amazon or who cares.

At least Downey is perfectly cast, the action is good and even though the ending is predictable its not a twenty year old plot thats rehashed until its a parody of itself.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1019,jmgindiana,"Adventure HAS a name, and it IS Indiana Jones",10,26 May 2008,"The first ten minutes of this movie show us why Steven Spielberg is regarded as a great director, and why Lucas, despite some moronic decisions, was able to make a fortune and build an empire upon two franchises. The answer is creativity and talent, two commodities frequently lost in modern cinema, drown in camera work and gimmicks.Harrison Ford was an excellent decision for the role from the first minute he was chosen. 27 years later he is still showing he was the only choice. He owns the character, and has great fun playing it. It's unbelievable that the guy is 64 years old. The action scenes are plenty of imagination and quite dynamic. Sure, there are parts that work better than others. The movie starts with a bang, slows down after half an hour -more or less-, when the characters arrive to South America to allow some exposition and plot development. But after that, it picks up once again until the end.Are there bad things? Sure. No movie is perfect. John Hurt is wasted in a role too small for his talents. Karen Allen shines again as Marion, but she, too, has too few scenes. I'd have loved to see a longer scene between her and Indiana. Cate Blanchett is not that compelling a villain, but to be fair, neither were Walter Donovan or Nazi commander Vogel in Last Crusade. The CGI is too obvious in some parts, and I think it could have been avoided completely in a couple of ocasions. The slow middle feels TOO slow, and some parts feel rushed. And the main crystal skull plot -and the ending- may be too far fetched for some viewers, despite being based on a theory as widely known as the legend of the Holy Grail.However, in the end the general experience is a great one, and it's clear why Indiana Jones has never been surpassed or even equated as an adventure icon, and why those who try are frequently labeled as ""Indy-clones"". There is only one Indiana Jones, and has just came back from a 19-year hiatus. He is older but in full form, as is Steven Spielberg. By the way, Spielberg shines in small details that other directors would miss. The very last shot of the movie is brilliant, and it's easy to see Mr. Spielberg's hand behind it.I have read a lot of hate against this movie, but aside from a few valid points -most of which I have addressed already- I was amazed at how inane were some of them. I have read people complaining about the shots of gophers in the movie (three of them, I think), that don't even reach thirty seconds combined. Or criticizing the excellent opening, saying the race at the beginning was ""pointless"". A ""race"" that didn't take more than two or three minutes of screen time, and during the opening credits. In sum, there are some valid points in the criticism, but mostly seems to come from people whose real problem is not against anything particular in the movie, but against the idea of THIS movie as a whole. I don't know why. Perhaps they represent the newer generations, who hate traditional film-making or can't stand the idea of an older man being the center of the action. In any case, while some of the criticism is valid, mostly it is not. If you want to have an honest opinion, go watch yourself.This is probably Indy's last ride with the visage of Harrison Ford, so do yourself a favor, and don't miss the chance of watching this on a big screen. You won't be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1020,aek6000,DVD Review,8,18 October 2008,"When I first saw Skull at the theater I left slightly disappointed. Its a good entertaining flick, but I think that so much hype/anticipation made it impossible to determine whether it was good or not.I mean a lot of people saw it once and that was it. So I bought the DVD like a true Indy fan and watched it again. After watching the behind the scenes featurette, then the flick itself I've come to the conclusion that its a damn good film.No its not Raiders or Crusade, but it is one thing, Indy. Skull is a really good entertaining film. Harrison is back in great form, I mean come on think of all the old man jokes prior to the film being released, one thing you can say is that everyone agrees that he was simply amazing as Indy again.Indy and Marion were great together, it felt like raiders all over again, those two have great chemistry. I'm one of the people that really doesn't like shia, but after seeing this film again, hes really not that bad. A lot of people just don't like him, so right away they weren't going to like his character from the get go. But if you look at the character set in that time period, hes pretty good, nothing spectacular, just a normal solid character. Hes Indy's son, but he doesn't have that charm that Indy has.Overall, this is a good adventure. Harrison made this film, as I watched this film I just smiled at how many great Indy moments there are. I'm really okay with the 'nuke the fridge seen' now, its outlandish, but Indy's had a lot of those moments, thats what makes him Indy.I honestly think that the audience has changed. Skull is Indy. Its not any different from the originals. The story unfolds the same way as the others did, and its a damn good adventure. To me its just that people my age are just different viewers. Teenagers/Twenty year olds make up the majority of todays audience, and it seem to me that people my age just bitch and moan about every blockbuster movie now a days. They pick and prod every little detail, rather then just sitting back and enjoying the films.If you're an Indy fan, this is a great flick. It's not better then Raiders or Crusade, but its damn good. 8/10 (I hope we get one more!)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1021,chenj-1,"Fortunately, Steven Spielberg wasn't part of the Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony",1,10 August 2008,"It takes certain skills to make an Indy movie this bad considering handful of financial resource and technical supports. It is nothing like previous Indy movies. Maybe audience are more demanding after so many good ones, or maybe Spielberg is getting a lot worse? I'd rather believe the latter one.Spielberg was invited to work as an art adviser at the Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony. He didn't accept the ofter(Many believe he revoked the offer, but the truth is he never accepted at the first place). And guess what, the Ceremony was made the best one in Olympics history with half as much as this movie's budget and no stars at all. Thank god for that~ I cannot possibly what was gonna happen if Spielberg was there.His latest movies are just getting worse and worse. Its not like many other directors who make movies a little bit worse every time when they get older. He go straight to the ultimate one. And he made it.Indy is as old as many grandpas, he can still move like monkeys. well, that's not it. To intrigue patriotism of audience, he replaced Nazi with Soviet Union. Gee~ so KGB can just chase Americans like robbers on American soil. And you think that's it? no, a Russian woman speaks English with British accent. I guess this somehow makes the movie a little bit funny.oh man, I cannot even continue my writings. It's just that awful.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1022,chrome_spokes,Adequate and thoughtful...,7,30 May 2008,"Nitpicking aside, I felt ""Crystall Skull"" was an adequate addition to the Indiana Jones canon. There is bound to be some disagreement across the board.Here's the point: the Indiana Jones franchise is built upon inquiries into the nature of what we know and what we don't know. That friction between what we know and don't know (and might not ever be able to know) constitutes the core of the appeal of Indiana Jones, and this film fulfills that ""suspension of belief,"" so to speak. All of the Indiana Jones movies, and especially this one, makes us question (or it should) the nature of our existence and our relation to existence, etc. ""Indiana Jones"" is the iconic representation of that spirit of inquiry and adventure that exists in the fields of science and exploration (ie. archeology, physics, biology, paleontology, etc). The question here is does ""Crystal Skull"" fulfill that premise? Does ""Crystal"" add to the canon or detract from it? I think it fits in nicely. Okay now for the nitpicking: I didn't like the chase in the jungle too much. The magnetic properties of the skulls opened a can of worms in terms of realistically portraying their effects in each and every scene; that's just painstaking... I think the film lost some momentum as it went. Mac sucked... He annoyed me. Indiana should have just kicked him in the groin or pushed him off a cliff or something (accidentally of course). But I guess we were supposed to hate the guy. He actually is the worst villain in the movie, I think. Some of the action scenes seemed a bit clunky and poorly imagined. And the climax could have been a little better delineated, for lack of a better word.But... I liked the prairie dogs, CGI or not. I thought they were hilarious. I thought the self-parody in the movie was also hilarious. The reunion of Marion and Indiana was terrific. And the movie had a fairly good resolution.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1023,turock,Not soon enough,10,27 May 2008,"I am not a critic, i do not work for a paper or website, I'm just a movie fan. I don't claim to know every little facet of film making i just know what i like.There are some critics who complain about a movie saying its bad the end.If your going to critique a movie take the time to make references where the movie failed.Now that thats out of the way let me get to the review.The Crystal Skull was a great movie with an original plot, great characters and lots of action. Zippy one liners that only Indy/Ford could pull off.This movie has a nice mix of character development, comedy, action and levity. It feels like a natural continuation of the last 3 movies.If you enjoyed the last 3 Indiana Jones films don't miss this one.It doesn't rely on special effects like CGI which is a nice change of pace in todays movie market. This doesn't mean there are no CGI visual effects just that they tried to scale it back from what so many other movies of today strive for.As a fan of Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf this is a great movie and definitely not one to miss.I just hope we don't have to wait 19 years for the next sequel.I mean i think it would be pretty cool to see Shia as the next Jones adventurer with Ford passing the whip on to the next generation.Hope this review is helpful to all the movie viewers out there who hate wasting money on poor quality movies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

But I managed to watch the three movies before the fourth one came out, so I know what the movie was talking about. Overall, it was a good movie. Harrison Ford did just as good as he did thirty years ago, even though he maybe isn't doing some of the fancy moves he did back in the day. The plot was a little modernized, with the whole ""Indy is my father"" thing, but overall it still had the same flare.But it did not have all the originality that the first three did; the moves were repeated, the jokes were kind of old, so it didn't create anything new like the old ones did. but overall....it's good to have him back. :D",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I tried to analyze myself, but it has nothing to do with such things.It's just really scrap! They screwed up a beautiful, legendary trilogy!George Lucas blackmailed Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford: Now or never! In the last years they've let written a crop of scripts and i'm sure there've been present some much more better scripts than this one.

1026,corey-tyler,This is why we go to the movies!,8,24 May 2008,"If you went to see this film hoping to see Raiders of the Lost Ark again you shouldn't have gone, no one should have been so stupid as to go into this film with that high of an expectation. This was meant to be a nostalgic throwback and to put a beloved hero on the big screen for possibly the last time. People are taking this film WAY too seriously, take it for what it is people, a sci-fi action film. Harrison did an amazing job suiting up as Dr. Jones again and Shia made a great addition to the cast. Blanchett's character was supposed to be over the top because that's the way the villains were in the 1950's serials which is what this film was modeled after! Some moments in the film were campy and a bit cheesy, but there have been moments like those in all of the Indy films. The action was very fun and very classic Indy. Anyone who truly loved the other Indy films will love this film as well, as long as they realize it's a new era. In the 1950's sci-fi was the rage and I thought it was great that they truly embraced the period with Russians and Sci-fi. And as for all of the people that are saying ""all who worked on this movie should feel shame"" ""and how dare they destroy a classic series"" I have two words for you ""grow up""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1027,SanitariumLXIX,"Not quite up to par, but I'll take it....",7,23 May 2008,"I liked it, but did not love it. And here's why...First the positive : First being that it had MOST of the hallmarks of an Indiana Jones movie. Why only most? More on that later. Starting with the Paramount mountain opening, which has a subtle message from Spielberg concerning the movie you are about to see. What message? More on that later. Next, the signature opening where Indy gets himself in trouble and escapes by the skin of this teeth. All very well done, which has a brief reference to the Ark (which was also referenced in Crudsade). The movie also has the gross out scene (ants), the map sequence twice, and several vehicle chase sequences.Second, the acting. Harrison Ford plays an aged Indy with great charm, and even channels a bit of John Wayne this time around. In fact, we find out that Indy was indeed a war hero between films. An even bigger surprise is Shia LaBeouf; he can act! And very well. The chemistry between these characters is brilliant. John Hurt was delightful and funny as Oxley.Third, the cinematography. Spielberg made DP Janusz Kaminski study the work of the other three film's DP Douglas Slocombe. And it paid off.Fourth, and most important, the action. There is tons of it. No punches pulled here, in fact probably more punches than any other Indy movie. And Harrison Ford ain't afraid to get dirty in this one either.Now the negative : The one I'm most upset about, the score. I love John Williams. My favorite movie composer, but I will have to give him a D+. Why? Each Indiana Jones movie has not only the Indy theme, but it's own individual theme to anchor the rest of the score. Unless I totally missed the boat, this film has no theme of its own. Sure it has some musical pieces not heard in the other films, and some echos of Raiders and Crusade (particularly in the warehouse, and when Indy is dwelling on his father), but no theme of its own **Please correct me if I'm wrong** Second, the aliens. Let's call them aliens, please. They really avoided calling them aliens in the movie, Oxley calling them ""beings from another dimension"" (cop out), but the're aliens. The secret is out. I will concede it makes sense given that the film takes place in the '50s, and the Myans are believed to have worshiped aliens, but this really has no place in an Indiana Jones movie, sorry. An object with mystical power from a deity has an aura of mystery and suspense. An object with mystical powers given by aliens takes the fun out of it.Third, the villains weren't very interesting. Cate Blanchette did a good job with what she had, but I found Spalko very boring. No depth. Ray Winstone's character Mac was unnecessary and very poorly conceived.Fourth, no foreign location shooting hurt the movie. I was afraid of this when I found out, and I was right. It really made the movie seem less organic than the others. The CGI didn't help matters. Granted it was needed for the climax, and the ants, but they should have stuck with matte painting for much of the rest.Finally, the script was good until the last 30 to 45 minutes. After which the tempo was way off, and the story started getting very hokey.All in all, an OK movie. I will accept it into the Indiana Jones family. Some will say that Lucas and Spielberg killed the franchise. I personally think that argument is childish. What can this movie possibly take away from Raiders or Crusade? Nothing. Not very many movies hold a candle to those films, this one especially. Spielberg knew this from the start, that is why he gave us a subtle message mentioned earlier with the Paramount mountain fading into a mole hill, then having said mole hill run over by a car full of fun loving teenagers. Message: don't make too much out of this, just enjoy the ride.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1028,alexbeene,"A Solid, Unique Entry to an Endearing Franchise",7,16 August 2010,"During the first meeting between Professor Henry Jones and Mutt Williams at a small diner, two sharply dressed agents confront them at their table.Quickly realizing the potential threat of both men, Mutt pulls out a weapon. Jones smirks and says, ""I think you brought a knife to a gun fight,"" as the agents began to pull dark firearms from their pockets.This quote sums up ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" as well as any amount of analysis could.The Indiana Jones franchise has always been a mixture of ""Rocky"" meets archaeology, a classic story of the underdog on a quest for greatness.The set-up for the film is pitch perfect; from the initial scenes, Indy is being dragged out of a 1950s' clunker automobile and forced to do the bidding of head Soviet agents.His escape and journey to return to the normal world is met with more than a few conflicts, but these are used to remind viewers of why they fell in love with the character in the first place.Much older than he was when he first dawned the famous brown hat in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" Harrison Ford returns to the role that made his career legendary with an almost timeless quality that demands respect.Well, at least for the first half of ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" When Shia Lebouf's character Mutt Williams joins the party, the story shifts from being about the beloved hero and becomes one that can best be labeled as ""Mutt's Coming of Age Saga."" Lebouf does little to make this new plot direction seem worthy; his character is more or less a 1950s version of his portrayal in ""Transformers"" last year.Mutt can do little to stop the film's momentum, which is undeniably suspenseful.To true Indy fans, the crazed CGI action sequences may be met with mixed responses, especially given the rough set-up of the original trilogy.Famed director Steven Spielberg is able to pull them off, and while one can wonder if they do much to substantially move the quest along, there is no denying their crowd-pleasing qualities.""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" has a plot not too far removed from the odd ""Space Men"" films of the generation it represents; during the 1950s, Hollywood became obsessed with presenting the possibilities of UFOs and aliens invading Earth.As foreign as the topic may be from Indy's previous adventures, the Crystal Skull story plays out surprisingly well and offers a finale that comes off stronger than it has any right to.Indiana Jones's fourth outing is similar to his last two; neither ""Temple of Doom"" nor ""Last Crusade"" matched the brilliance of the Spielberg's original masterpiece.Fans may be disappointed about the shift in focus from Indy to Mutt as the film progresses, but, for the most part, this is a solid entry into the franchise.For a cinematic series that has been out of the game for nearly 20 years, the ""Indiana Jones"" name is given the solid return it deserves.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

What is left from the legendary Indiana Jones franchise? There are no traps. There are no puzzles you can try to solve with the main characters. There are much less scenes and dialogs that are actually fun. All actors act passive and remain totally flat. There is no traveling outside South America. Why don't they visit - for example - Russia to give their new enemies a bit more character? Sure, directing is good and cast as well, but - and that's the main problem - the action *and* the story are totally unbelievable and stupid! Why does Steven Spielberg needs to have aliens in each and every movie??? What's next, ""Saving Private Ryan 2"" with aliens? Aliens just don't fit to Indiana Jones - and that ruins the entire movie.

I'd really loved all the first three movies, because in my opinion, they were perfect examples for timeless adventure classics and movie magic extraordinaire, each in its own style. Indy himself was one of my childhood heroes ... heck, I even loved the TV series (well, mostly), but when I saw this one, I almost puked my guts out. Honestly, I wanted to like it badly, but this flick is so incredibly stupid, so inconsistent and amazingly badly written, it's plain unbearable. All things which made the other movies so great are missing: the excitement of discovery, the thrilling adventure, the enjoyable character relations, the sarcastic yet charming humor, the over-the-top but still believable action scenes - all gone. What remains is this brainless, soulless, uninspired load of junk that (sadly) will score at the box office anyway, just because it's Indy - sort of. But worst of all, as you can clearly see in almost every take, the love is gone from the franchise. Even Harrison Ford looks mostly like he's just going through the motions. For my part, I blame it all on the ABSOLUTELY SHITTY AND THOROUGHLY DUMB SCRIPT that 1) DENIES THE ACTORS ALMOST EVERY POSSIBILITY TO ACT (Karen Allen being the worst example) and 2) has literally everything that also made the star wars prequels fail: the ham-fisted dialogue, the completely ridiculous ""storytelling"", forced character development and relations, plot holes one could fly the death star through, overused CGI effects, the lamest humor imaginable ... the list goes on and on. So thanks, George Lucas, for ruining just another childhood love of mine - you couldn't have made it worse by introducing Steven Seagal as Indys long lost brother.

Firstly Harrison is old - maybe he should thought of the Indiana comeback when he didn't look so withered and old. Secondly, the story line was so out of this world. Why the ""alien"" plot. It should have stuck to its winning formula, hunting for treasure etc. The supporting cast was very boring to say the least. I don't even remember Karen Allen from the first Indiana Jones. Shia looks very stiff in this movie. I thought he would be fun to watch after seeing him in the Transformers but apparently I guess he was made to act that way so not to steal the limelight from Mr. Ford (I repeat - I'm a huge fan) Cate Blanchett should definitely be nominated for Razzie Award - this has been her worst performance everSeriously, I think this project should have come out about 10 years ago and preferably with a better story line. I think that they just threw this together for the benefit of someone but it was wasted on Indie Fans.I do hope this is the last installment and should they decide to return it, they should return with Indie's son - preferably played by someone not so ""stiff"" But like I said before, perhaps he had to play the character that wayAnyway - definitely not for your DVD collection - anyway - not mine.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Now I've seen it and am a little disappointed. As you can see I've given the movie 6 stars out of 10. That isn't such a bad vote but I'd hoped to make it a little higher. There is too many examples of scamped editing and the story is a little to spacey. Around 32 minutes into the film there Indy and his upcoming son is talking while sitting in a bar, there's a time in a Mutt-shoulder shot where Mutt talks to Indy but without moving head, mouth or anything. I know it's just a tiny glitch but it isn't good enough when people like myself notice such things the first time they watch the movie. Just an example. And the whole story of aliens as gods is seen before to many times just think of ""Alien vs. Predator"" from 2004. And the episode there Mutt doing his ""Tarzan-thing"", where the h did that come from. I'm sorry but I've difficulties to take both of them serious, it's a little to far-fetched. But of course it's a good idea indeed but I would have expected something else, something a little more ""Indiana Jones-ly"". Okay so far I've mostly been negative but that's not all. The visual effects works pretty good and ditto to special effects and many of the ""Indiana Jones-elements"", like the red line illustrating the travels and the hat, is maintained.

Will it be able to live up to the success of its predecessor(s) or will it ruin everything. Well as a longtime fan of Indiana Jones I didn't have high expectations. Well of course I expected greatness. Spielberg and Lucas how can you possibly go wrong with that? The answer - You can't.Crystal Skull is a fantastic adventure that is just as good as the original movies. Everything we knew is there and more. As always the story draws heavy inspiration from old radio dramas, movies and whatever Lucas spend his childhood and youth watching it works perfectly. The acting is pretty great and its good to see the return of Karen Allen.But whether or not you will like Crystal Skull might not depend on its quality. If you are an old hardcore Jones-fan and have a fragile health there is a chance you might contact The Phantom Menace disease. This is a horrible illness where you won't be able to see a movie's quality and blame it for being completely different from it's predecessors though its the same.I encourage anyone to watch this movie though I probably won't have to.

It's unengaging, just like the new characters. I'm a huge fan of the underrated and underemployed Karen Allen, but if she hadn't been in this film it wouldn't have made much difference.

1036,thatgingerguy88,Good Indiana Jones Fun,7,28 May 2008,"This is the first review I have written on IMDb......and i feel compelled because what I (and most of my friends/people at the theater) loved this Indy movie, and i come on here and am shocked by the hate it receives. ""Oh surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge ruined a movie"", or ""aliens? after 19 years thats the best they could do?"" I don't know if people walked into this movie expecting to see Saving Private Ryan or Munich or if they are just blind, but this movie is great fun so don't let the negative reviews put you off.The acting is great. Harrison Ford steps back into Indy's shoes like he never took them off, bull-whip and everything. The chemistry between him and newcomer Shia LaBoeuf is refreshing, and contrary to what many people have said Shia does a great job here and doesn't tarnish the franchise in any way. Karen Allen is back as Marion, but she lacks the edge she had in Raiders. Still nice to see her back though. the only disappointment I found was the villain, Cate Blanchette does OK with what was in the script, but the villain she's given to play is just uninteresting to begin with. Now the plot. So much complaining and whining about this, probably who thought the same people that searching for a holy grail was such an original idea (been done and redone a thousand times). Basically, anyone who appreciates the original Indiana Jones movies will know that they were 1930's style serials, just meant to be a take on the stuff Spielberg and Lucas grew up watching. Almost 2 decades later, society has changed, people's attention are on different issues, and in the 1950's people, aliens/UFO's were all the rage. I find it perfect that this movie deals with that, and on top of that if anyone paid attention to the movie, they aren't even outer space aliens, they are inter-dimensional (4th dimension) and with a bit of research you can find that the 4th dimension is a very plausible idea and many scientists support the idea of more dimensions, whether there is life there, who knows? But i thank Spielberg and Lucas for a nice take on the subject. Either way, if you can buy sand from the ark of covenant turning to ghosts and spirits, and that a man can rip out another mans heart and keep him alive, than you should have no problem buying this plot for 2 hours.Special effects were good as well. I thought the jungle chase scene was great and Shia particularly was impressive in this scene. CGI wasn't overused and complemented the story nicely. I don't know what people's problem with all the CGI/Effects shots were (the waterfall scene, Shia sword fighting on 2 trucks) when like i said surviving a plane crash and dropping thousands of feet in a rubber dingy boat is just as unrealistic. Is it fun though? You bet! This movie starts and never lets up. I was glad to have Indy back, and although this film isn't as good as Raiders or Crusade, its good in it's own right and nothing short of spectacular entertainment.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1037,aj-rollingproductions,I just don't get it...How is it possible to create such garbage?!,1,25 June 2008,"Mr. Silbelberg has come along way since his first feature 'Duel'. Which was a simple story transformed into a great piece of cinema through great directing. It was a first film to be proud of.A few decades later and along comes Indy 4...WHAT THE F*#K!? How did they approve this script, HOW?! i honesty don't know, MY god.!!! F*#KEN ALEINS!??????? are you serious. when i saw that massive spaceship rise from the ground like a huge wad of CGI turd i could have cried.The previous films where adventures of mythical artifacts, IE/ the holy grail. How do you go from the holy grail to a massive alien spaceship. I cant believe i am typing these words in my Indy 4 review. A SPACESHIP!, my god i still can't believe it.I couldn't find anything in this film that is truly worth savoring. Shia i think will be a tom cruise superstar in years to come. He has some acting ability but if he chooses to only to films such as Transformers and Indiana Jones sequels then he won't be respected like a good actor should.I had heard good things about the jeep chase. Wow!? are you kidding me? good?! It was TERRIBLE! It was what the truck scene in Raiders would have looked like if done with CGI.I had also heard that a lot of this film would be made would 'old school' stunts and filming techniques. Well?! Who the F*%K said that because they are bullshit liars. There is more CGI than Spielbergs last outing in War of the Worlds. The only part which made me actually go WOW!,there's some nice stuff which reminds me of the old films and a time when films where worth watching was the head-on truck collision in area 51.I could see them trying to recapture the old films look with the camera shots. The zoomed in shot of Indy running over the hill being chased by the natives in Raiders was copied several times in Kingdom.This was no Indy film. It was what 21st century Hollywood has become, a moneymaking monster that eats and destroys timeless works of art because the executives love wiping their ass with the green.The thing that bugs me the most is the fact they had the best trilogy ever made with Indy 1,2 and 3 (i cant be bother typing their actual film names.) To go with the best trilogy ever was the best ending to a trilogy and one of the best endings to a film ever in the Last Crusade. I still laugh and giggle when i hear Indy was named after a dog. They ride off into the sunset on a cloud of satisfaction.There was no reason what so ever to make this film, NONE, not one. The fans didn't want another Indy and it's certainly not like anyone else need it. There it is, Black and White.

1038,mederjake-1,It was a good movie,9,26 May 2008,"I don't understand why everyone is being so harsh on this movie. Overall I thought it was good and entertaining. Yes there are some flaws with, but guess what? EVERY MOVIE HAS SOME FLAWS!!! People are pointing out plot holes and problems with it and do you know why? They went into this movie with very low expectations and didn't care about the movie. They just wanted to go ""Oh, this does that when it should do something else and that just proves that Hollywood is just trying to make $.""But they just want to make a good movie. And in my opinion they pulled off the alien plot as subtly as an Indiana Jones movie can. And one more thing, when people say that in Area 51 the alien doesn't have a skull so it shouldn't be magnetic, but if it already didn't have a skull when Indy examined it and determined magnetic qualities that would mean that THE ENTIRE SKELETON HAD MAGNETIC QUALITIES.

1039,austrumubanka,worst Spielberg's movie,3,27 May 2008,"Usually Spielberg's name is recognized as a brand which always guarantees good quality. Indiana Jones 4 is definitely exception. The movie is full of illogical mistakes, events are full of unreal moments and the script is childish. The taste after the movie is typical sense of being diddled out of money by the use of reputation of previous parts. The only good words can be dedicated to actors (especially LaBeouf and Blanchett), some visual effects and quite unusual outcome (usually possibility of aliens or other mysteries are rationally explained at the end). If you are so curious or you want to see it to fill the checklist, then better choose to rent it or rather wait to see it on TV, otherwise it is not worth the time, nor money.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1040,winslowarizona,"Watchable, but don't expect Raiders.",5,29 May 2008,"To say that I was a victim of the hype the first time I saw this movie is an understatement. Like many, I have eagerly awaited the film for a long time and hung on every trailer released and little bits of extra info given out by crew/cast in interviews.So I was bound to be disappointed. However, after seeing it for the first time, I was just plain annoyed. But why? Friends asked ""is Harrison Ford too old for it now?"" - No, not a bit of it. He carries off Indy with a more mature outlook and obviously many more adventures under his famous hat, but the swaggering confidence, likability and style he had in the other movies is 100% still there.""Was the story no good?"" - No, without giving spoilers, it's based on a plausible premise (as plausible as an Indy movie has ever been).In essence I think the problem was a very small minority of the movie just made me go ""oh, come ON!"". Parts are just so unfeasibly far-fetched and other parts so predictable, that they merge to spoil the good in-between.Aside, the script isn't brilliant and certainly not worthy of Hurt, Ford and Winstone. Karen Allen is as wooden as wood and Shia LaBeouf is the unlikeliest 'greaser' I've ever seen.When I watched it for a second time last night it wasn't half as bad, but my mind was ready to gloss over the ""oh, come on!"" bits and I enjoyed the rest.Besically, a movie spoilt by trying to cram too much in and lacing it all together with spider-web-thin dialogue.Shame.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1041,DrWillHatch,Another great addition to the saga,8,1 October 2008,"Actually, I find this to be the second best after Raiders, it had me riveted from start to finish. I'm going the Roger Ebert route with this one. If you liked the previous Indiana Jones entries, you should like this one, and if you didn't, don't waste your time. Apparently some people totally hated this movie for its lack of realism or any pretense of realism for that matter. While I can see that there are holes in the film(A film like this or any of the other Jones films should be watched with a belief that this is some sort of strange, more exciting alternate reality than our own), with the exception of the inexplicable ending, I could suspend any disbelief because of how great this film is. It isn't as tight as ""Raiders"" is in the logic department, but I still loved it, and in spite of the lamebrain alien mythology, it is still a smart film.All of the actors are very good. Harrison Ford is exactly the same as he was when we had last seen him, and I appreciate that he is subject to human emotions and isn't just another noble superman. He is cocky, impatient, occasionally rude and even a little ruthless. Shia LaBeouf equips himself nicely as Mutt, he is an able sidekick. Cate Blanchett is a little bizarre as the Soviet in charge of retrieving alien and paranormal objects for Khruschev I suppose, but her goons are intimidating enough. Karen Allen doesn't get nearly enough screen time and is neutered from her more fun and spunky time in ""Raiders"". Basically all of the main characters as well as the supporting players are lively, likable(or loathful) and intelligently acted.The action scenes are excellent, and very cool. I for one, actually liked the sword fight scene, as implausible as it was, there was so much going on during that scene and afterward, it was great fun. The car chase through the streets of Indianas home town and through the college at which he(until just recently according to an important plot device scene) teaches was the highlight, I thought. The infamous nuclear testing scene is bizarre and humorous and totally cool to have, I don't care how bogus it was.These are just a few whiffs of the many thrills you'll have.This isn't the type of film one can review with giving any insight, either you have a good time or you don't.

1042,paoloemanuele,Merely a bad filmed Indiana Jones rip-off.,1,30 September 2008,"Indy 4 is just an ugly cash-in. There's no other way to explain it. How on earth could Mr. Spielberg and Lucas agree on this script is beyond my comprehension. And it's not just the plot, it's badly filmed, edited, the musical score is way below the standards we'd expect from John Williams, and the over-abused CGI makes it look more like an Indy spoof than an Indy sequel. Ford doesn't deliver one-liners the way he used to (but I'd rather blame the dumb, cheesy dialog for that), Karen Allen is just useless and not even a shadow of what she was in Raiders. Shia LeBouff is no great actor and we knew it, here he's not fully awful but no memorable either. John Hurt and Winstone are wasted for stupid useless characters, the first playing most of the film the Savior-fool cliché, the later an hybrid between the stereotyped greedy-English-traitor of many old American war-movies and John Rhys-Davies character in 'King Solomon's Mines, actually an Indy-spoof from 1986. And in fact Indy 4 could easily be more a money pumped-up Allan Quatermain than a Indiana Jones movie. I believe they had the right script when they did the Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis video game in 1991, when Ford was young and Spielberg still a good Hollywood director. But it wasn't written by Lucas and we all know how egocentric the man is. Let's hope at least we won't have the insipid and little-talented Shia as the next hero. But then again, we won't be forced to watch it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1044,muffingoddess38,Well....It's an Indy Movie.,7,3 June 2008,"There are times when your reputation precedes you. Taken out of the context of the rest of the Indiana Jones series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a rather strong entry in the blockbuster category for Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, well above par for such films (though films like National Treasure and The Mummy tended to set that bar at a reachable level.) The fourth Indiana Jones film was almost expected to be a second coming: a magic reunion of the creator of the blockbuster (Spielberg), the creator of fanboys (writer/co-creator George Lucas), and America's ever suffering, ever dependable scoundrel hero, Harrison Ford. Add in possibly the best actress working today, Cate Blanchett, the return of Karen Allen, and that kid the teenagers love (the undeservedly downplayed Shia LaBeouf) and you should have a project that not only breaks records, but produces a darn good result.On its own, KoCS is a strong action/adventure film, but, for an Indy movie its, well, mediocre. It seems like all the elements are there. Harrison Ford barely creaks as the sixty-something adventurer, and LaBeouf is much less annoying and much more endearing than certain other Indy sidekicks (like Kate Capshaw.) John Hurt takes a sorrowful turn as one of Dr. Jones's colleagues whose mind has gone. The acting is better than passable and the effects, though at times more creaky than Ford, are satisfactory. What is missing?Well, much like our leading man himself, the series doesn't seem what it used to be. While moving the film to the 50s to accommodate Indy's age is a good idea, the typical white-black Indiana Jones morality doesn't fit the Cold War model as well. When the FBI are as dubious as the KGB, the rules of the game have changed, perhaps for the better, but when the nuclear paranoia goes the way of 50s sci-fi, it seems that Spielberg and Lucas have stretched the Indy universe a little too far a little too fast, and fans are feeling the chafing. So the issue is then not what is missing, but what has changed. Nevertheless, new viewers will be pleasantly surprised and hopefully old fans will be able to adjust. Perhaps if the aliens didn't look like the typical Spielberg universe extraterrestrials, the faithful wouldn't be so upset. Maybe giving Ford some good one-liners would have helped too.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1047,greenpower,Indy4: The least serious of the 4 and probably the funniest !,7,1 June 2008,"I'm a long time Indy fan. As most of you I watched Raiders when I was very young and became hooked to it ever since. I've probably watched raiders for some 50 times, temple of doom 20 and last crusade 30. All said, here follows my review.Indy 4 review -------------Cast: Good old Harrison is back and did well, no disappointment what so ever. Shia was believable as Indy's adventure companion, however no match to Sallah, Marcus, Elsa, Henry the senior, .. and questionably even to short-round (story problem?). Karen was OK but seemed a bit forced at times (a bit rusty as many people already pointed out). Kate did well, at good style Indy villain, that is not exaggeratedly evil nor lunatic. In my opinion Indy is not about Hannibal nor Darth Vader style villainy but more about believable strong motive people: Belloq, Shiva priest guy, Donovan and now gorgeous Kate. John Hurt did what the script demanded from him, to act as crazy basically. Ray was OK, sleazy, buddy style backstabber, no big complaints here.Story: Good enough. Based on real myth, real civilization. I don't quite understand why the hate against the alien plot. Indy was always about the supernatural. Religion in essence - 1st: Judaic, 2nd: Hindu, 3rd: Christianism ... 4th: Scientific/Atheist/Alternative. Quite coherent.Ending: Indy endings were always like this. Indy never keeps the artifact (ark, stones, grail, skull). The end is always about some spectacular event with an element surprise and somehow horrible deaths for the villains (eaten by ants, being disintegrated qualify for this).Animal appearances: OK .. so far so good but .. what was it with the ""animals executive producer""? Indy always had animals OK: spiders, snakes, bugs, all believable but .. Groundhogs?!, doom ants and ""anti-communists"" monkeys? Groundhogs were very good supporting actors in groundhog day (excellent movie by the way) but not in Indy .. soo not there. The ant scene was embarrassingly cartoonish, unreal (kinda like Marabunta meets the Mummy), could have been 100x times better (some problem with ""CGI executive producer""?. Summary: Cast: Good. No big complaints. Story: Good enough. Quite coherent. Ending: Mind blowing but .. unsatisfying with a sense of being unfinished, and so .. Perfect for Indy series! How more unsatisfying of an end can be the one of Raiders, were the ark is just .. lost in the junk? That is the magic :) Animals: Without the animal schizophrenia I would give this film a solid 9.Recommended for all. Indy fans need to see this and not take 1 (?? what a hell?) and 2 for a review.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1049,swissonbrownrye,"Harrison Ford, despite handicaps, carries it across the finish line",7,28 January 2017,"Karen Allen is in this one. Karen Allen was in the first Indiana Jones movie as well. Allen's movie career went absolutely nowhere after she was miscast in the first Indiana Jones movie. The original choice for the female lead in that one was Maureen McCormick, but she flubbed her audition when she arrived on the set under the influence of cocaine and having not slept for three days. Allen was the second choice and a bad one, but Harrison Ford's charisma and Spielberg's direction saved that movie and made it a hit. In this fourth installment we have, along with Harrison Ford and Allen (reprising her role from the original movie) Shia LaBeouf, which is another bad choice. LaBeouf lacks the charisma (likability) necessary for an actor to have a successful career, at least as a leading man, and he comes across in his public life as an obnoxious, self obsessed, emotionally unstable little twerp. I hope for his sake that he grows up someday. He could be a marvelous character actor or supporting actor if he were offered those roles. Let him be a villain, or the leading man's nerdy side kick, and I guarantee audiences will love him. There could be an Oscar in his future, but in a character role, not as a leading man. He would do well to finish his education too. He may need that to fall back on someday. Despite these handicaps this movie just manages to lumber across the finish line with the talents of that old workhorse Harrison Ford, who with excellent direction and special effects manages to carry this movie to success.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1050,quis_ego,"Very entertaining, but spoiled by some really unlikely bits",7,27 May 2008,"Well, the good news is, this is not as bad as 'Temple of Doom'. But it's no 'Raiders'..Most of the reviews I'd seen of this gave it a thumbs down, so I was not too hopeful. To my surprise, I quite enjoyed it, but it did have several scenes in it which were so ridiculously implausible that it called for a lot more than suspension of disbelief.So, plot summary: Indy and new sidekick 'Mutt' go off to South America in search of a) a crystal skull, and b) Mutt's mum and close buddy 'Ox' - with some stereotypical Russian baddies in tow, who also want to get their commie hands on the skull (because it holds awesome power, or something). The skull is from an alien, they find it and it gets returned to its rightful owner - The End.Not the greatest plot, but then 2 of the first 3 films had the Nazis as the baddies, and they're always worth fighting against. One of the weaknesses of 'Temple of Doom' was that it involved mythical artifacts rather than legendary artifacts. We are now back to mythical artifacts - and no Nazis - so it's really hard to care.The good bits: Indy - he's a bit more talkative than previous films, but you know how rambly people get as they get older (while the rest of us are too polite to tell them to just ""skip to the end""). He's still fairly agile though, and doesn't do much stupid comedy mucking about. His trousers stay suspiciously clean throughout - seriously, he looks like he's just stepped out of a department store changing room, trying them on for size.Mutt - new sidekick, who is capable and not annoying and so hooray for that. All too often Indy's main sidekick is an annoying 'comedy' sidekick for most of their screen time - i.e. Marion, Willie, Short Round, Salaah, Henry Jones Sr and Marcus Brody etc etc. Mutt does not do much 'comedy' messing about and it's a refreshing change.The so-so bits: Marion - doesn't really do much of any note. Bit of a waste.Cate Blanchett - a bit too stereotypical with the accent and the haircut - but then, it's probably hard to play a Russian baddie without a Russian accent so seems unfair to complain too much about that.The crystal skull itself. Crystal? Surely, perspex stuffed with cling film? I'm surprised they couldn't have made it twinkly like a crystal tumbler, that would have been more special.The rubbish bits: Ray Winstone - once again starring in this film as Ray Winstone. Can he play any other character? Is he a double agent? Or a triple agent..? Do we care? No. Within 7 minutes of meeting him, he's switched sides. Too early! The fridge scene. Oh come _on_. I could just about have accepted Indy surviving inside a lead-lined fridge at ground zero, but being blown through the air a mile or two away and surviving without a scratch - totally implausible. He'd be a pile of broken bones - and he'd be dead.The good guys plunging over 3 enormous waterfalls (after already plunging over the edge of a cliff in a car) with nary a scratch. This was just.. stupid.Time taken for the Russkies to get to the temple: After plunging over all the waterfalls (and thus travelling at least 2 miles or so), Indy and Co running away from the natives, unlocking the temple and running down the steps to the bottom, Cate Blanchett and co still got to the base of the temple about 8 minutes after Indy and Co did. How did they get there so fast, and how did they get down without the steps? This could be a genuinely big plot hole.The Lucasfilm gophers. Yes, George, we already know you do CGI animals now - but you still can't do them very well. Please stop.The 'Mutt swinging through the vines' scene. Already pretty unlikely, but adding the friendly monkey companions too? For quality of monkeys, see 'gophers' comment above.The whole 'Alien' plot line, really. Why did 13 skeletons come back to life as a living single being? Were they dead or not? Surely the last time they were all together they could have flown off then? If it takes a crystal skull to get into the temple, how did the conquistador get in there and steal the 13th skull? Why did the alien kill Cate Blanchett, she just wanted 'information' like they freely gave to the Incas/Mayans/Aztecs whatever, didn't she? I think what made earlier Indy films slightly magical was that Indy overcame the perilous odds by sheer good luck, nifty driving, daring-do, excellent horsemanship, a mean pair of fists, etc. He didn't survive these things just by not dying when by rights, he should have done (see 'fridge' and 'waterfall' moments above). This is really a bit insulting to the intelligence of the audience - you can't thrill us by having our heroes behave as though they were rubber supermen.I did enjoy it. But as my summary says - I think it was a bit ruined by the really ridiculous bits above. They could have left these out, or not have had them be as far-fetched and it would have been a better film for it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1051,mrjessjess,Not quite what I expected.,6,17 November 2012,"The movie played out like a cheap thrill ride at Universal from moment to moment full of cheesy adventure clichés.Ridiculous situations and events that just don?t add up realistically. Characters that were overly stereotyped. Dialogue that pays no attention to the plot except when it is the only means of telling the story. In other words the search and discovery puzzle solving felt and sounded utterly scripted and predictable. It was surprisingly violent and at the same time family oriented. There were some scenes that felt misplaced and unnecessary. The ending didn't really do anything for me. Just you?re run of the mill happily ever after. The whole alien aspect of the film took away from its credibility and believe-ability. stretching it into a strange fiction fantasy, instead of a historical and geographical adventure. Too many attempts at humor caused the action to become fool hardy rather than thrilling.

1052,samson_k,The Worst Crime for an Indiana Jones film is to be bland!,3,25 May 2008,"Like many people my age - Raiders of the Lost Ark had an immense effect on me, it served as a catalyst for my loves of history, adventure fiction and writing. It is, for me, the perfect movie.I have been waiting for this for 19 years and as I sat down to watch it in a cinema that was busier than I had seen it for years I began to get a good vibe - Indy was back.However, two hours later I could only really question that statement - was Indy back? Really? Unfortunately for me the answer had to be no. Sure there was a man in a hat who looked like Indiana Jones and talked like Indiana Jones, but it was a pale ghost of the character that I had wanted to see and he was appearing in a listless, grey adventure that just never seemed to really get started. This wasn't the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull - this was the Kingdom of the needless exposition. Almost as soon as Indy appeared along with his old buddy Mac (a shamefully wasted Ray Winstone) we were being bombarded with information - there seemed to be a need to explain absolutely everything - we learnt that Mac had known Indy and had fought in the war with him. We learnt why the Russians were there and what they were looking for - we learnt far too much.In earlier days did we ever find out how Indy and Sallah first met? No, there was no need.The action was there and it should have been exciting but nothing grabbed my adrenaline glads and began to squeeze them. The humour was there but for such a packed cinema there was not one good belly laugh that went through the cinema. The jokes, such as they were, just happened - the sequence with the Marcus Brody statue was there and I'm not sure whether that was meant to be a joke or not.The film has far too many characters and then just doesn't know what to do with them, Mac changes sides so many times that I found myself not caring. Oxley, a potentially interesting character was a cypher and nothing more. Indy acted so much out of character on so many occasions that I began to suspect that this wasn't actually an Indiana Jones script.This was like if Eon had stopped making Bond films with Thunderball and then come back with Octopussy.I have never felt so let down by a film in my life, even the Star Wars prequels did not disappoint me this much and I hated them.This was like an Indy rip-off from 1985",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1053,greengator,Not your fathers Indy,5,26 May 2008,"When my ""On Demand"" feature in my cable service decided to crap out this weekend, I decided to brave the crowds and see the new edition. Usually I would wait a couple of weeks, let the crowds slow down, check out the reviews to see if the movie was worthwhile, bur this time I pressed on, I went to an early showing so the crowds were not too bad, but that did not diminish my disappointment in the film. The earlier films all had some plot line basis in religious theology - as far-fetched as they were - The Holy Grail, The Ark, and the Stone all led some credence to the plot. But this time - flying saucers and men from outer space - gimme a break.The characters aged nicely and the introduction of Mutt was a plus. I also liked the way Marian's character was handled. The action sequences were up to par, but the plot line..........I suspect #5 will have Indy and Marian catching a ride on the Space Shuttle to the moon or Mars to find the source of why the tides rise and fall or something as far-fetched as that.I give this movie a 5 - 8 for the characters and 2 for the plot - To think I endured 30 minutes of on-screen commercials and preview for this.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1054,shifty1032231,A Waistless Effort on a Great Franchise,3,1 June 2008,"I rarely write comments on films on IMDb but after seeing this I had to tell everyone why they should not waste their 10 bucks on this film at the theaters. Believe me, I wanted to like this film but but as it kept going on and on I sank in my chair in despair. So how can Lucas and Spielberg ruin a great action adventure film in a series like this? There are many answers but the overall theme is laziness. The film is lazy and incomprehensible. Many are aware of what the Crystal Skulls are, alien skulls, and that at the end of the film I was expecting to hear the communicating song from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. There was no sense of adventure and thrill but one action scene tacked onto another with a plot on auto pilot. The character of Indy has been watered down. His charm and charisma have been lost in a shamble of dialogue that I assume Lucas wrote because it reminiscence his last three prequel Star Wars trilogy. I was interested in the beginning of the film as the film jumped the action with us understanding why some dominatrix looking commie (Cate Blanchett) kidnapped Jones and his associate (who is a double agent, comes on Indy's side and then a double agent again... so confusing)) kidnapped Jones. It seemed to go fine into there. We saw Indy use his whip and crash into a car with a comical side. I thought it was going to be fun. After escaping Area 51, the secret location from the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark with the boxes, Jones finds his way into a town. It is not a normal town but one of those built and tested for atomic attacks. Well wouldn't you know it a attack comes and Indy hides in a refrigerator and survives while a speeding car explodes into pieces. I was thinking, I hope this is the only this would be the corniest moment. Wrong. After the establishment of Shia LeBeaouf meeting Indy we are in another comical chase from under cover commies. I guess when your in a malt shop in the 50s and someone says that they are KGB out loud everyone else ignores them. The only benefit of the film comes from Shia and Indy's relationship in Peru. Their dialogue and reactions to each other saved this film from a 1 star rating. Indy seems tired and not like himself and this is never recovered in the plot to why he is more tired. We know he is much older and Harrison tries to save the character in a different character age but what do we get out of it. Once the characters are kidnapped by the Soviets again we are taken into one charade after another. So these Crystal Skulls, we learn, are skulls of Aliens inside the real El Dorado which is not the city of gold. We also learn that Shia is Indy's son to Marion from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Again Lucas and Spielberg lose their taste and talent in plot development for these characters. Before we can accept them they are all forced by chase and action scenes to be in love again and unrealistically chased around the jungle full of lazy CGI and plausibility. The we reach the city and the Crystal Skulls. Wow how effortless and less of a discovery than the first three films. It was like I was watching National Treasure 2 all over again with a plot on autopilot and these characters are going along as it goes without any consideration or development. Then we have the Raiders of the Lost Ark ending again with the commie villain (who is more of a pet girl than a villain) being sucked by the aliens when the skulls are re attached. Is she looking at the lost ark of the covenant. From what I can tell she was. Then we have the close encounters ending with the space ship rising and leaving the alien. Wow... how original. We take archeology and turn it into a alien movie. Jeez Spielberg and Lucas, can you not make a film that is not about aliens? Then the film ends in the cliché ending of Marion and Jones marrying as if we had time to see their love develop. It happened as another way of being conventional in the manner of story arc clichés. I was so mad after seeing this I am telling my friends to save their 10 bucks. I did and one of them, who didn't take my advice, came back to me and told me I was right. I felt sorry for him that he wasted his money on a film that fails its fans. If they make Indiana Jones 5 then I will be very hesitant to see it but how can a bad Indy 5 top this piece of crap? Only Lucas and Spielberg will know.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1055,drbone007,First movie I ever walked out on...ever,1,24 May 2008,"First off, let me say that I enjoy Indiana Jones. I am not fanatical by any means, that is what Batman is for, but I enjoy them. They are entertaining and well written movies that perfectly balance comedy, action, adventure and inspiration. Raiders left us speechless; Temple left us amused and perhaps slightly shaken, but still entertained; Crusade left us very happy and entertained.Then there is Crystal Skull.5 Reasons why I walked out: 1: The whole movie felt lost: From the very get go the movie seemed to be jumping around. We were here then there then over there then back here again. It was all over the map (Quite literally). There just seemed to be no direction at all and all shook up. I can't really explain it, but that is just how it felt. Rushed I think is the word.2: Aliens: I get that Harrison Ford was in Star Wars AND in Indiana Jones. The twain, however, should NEVER, EVER, EVER meet. The religious implications of the original trilogy worked well; they made it believable. Psychic powers and alien control, however...is a bit far-fetched. Jones is an archaeologist, not a Mulder and Scully.3: CGI Gophers who giggle: Enough said. (Thank you George Lucas...and you know it was his idea) 4: The reunion special vibe: ""Remember when we had so much fun 20 years ago?"" ""Remember when this was easier 20 years ago?"" ""Remember when Dad was alive?"" ""Remember when Marcus Brody was alive?"" ""Remember when the movies were entertaining?"" Perhaps not the last one, but the others are almost direct quotes. I enjoy Karen Allen, but she is the only throw back to the original I needed. The whole movie seemed like a reunion special. Nice to have and see the gang together, but contrived in plot and development.5: Shia Lebouf: He is not a good actor. Please stop putting him in things. Unless he pulls a Leonardo Dicaprio when he gets older, I'm not dealing with him any more. Put your comb away, I get it; you're a greaser who is badass yet insecure. (He was the initial reason for my concern with this movie, but he fell to 5 after I saw it. I can tolerate him, but not the rest of this.) I'm glad I already own Raiders and Crusades, I didn't buy Temple because I just don't feel it's a movie I can sit down and watch for fun. I don't even want to see Crystal Skull in a box set with the others. It would feel more at home as a triple pack with X-Files: Fight the Future and the new one X-Files: I Want to Believe.I didn't even walk out on Spiderman 3, and I thought that was the worst blockbuster movie I ever saw. Indiana Jones, however, I didn't even care about the outcome. Oh, but don't worry everyone. There will be enough people to go see this movie that they WILL MAKE ANOTHER ONE. Lucas has already made it clear here wouldn't mind Shia Lebouf in the lead.If you have never watched the South Park episode where Stan, Kyle and Cartman want to save classic films from being remade by their directors...watch it and you will know exactly how I feel about this movie. I want to join their cause.Thanks for reading",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1056,cruncher-836-369335,"Very fun, but not the greatest Indiana Jones movie out there",8,2 December 2013,"I know this movie gets some hate for the aliens, and the monkeys. And I tell those people... they were right. The monkeys were just downright silly and they could have done something so much better with the ending. This movie has lots of CG, almost too much. and I feel like they could have progressed Indy and Marion's love story a little bit more. And Mac needed to pick a freaking side!!! Now that I have the negatives out of the way, time to focus on the positives. The story- besides what I already mentioned- is fine, and even though it's kind of confusing it still prevails in a way. The action scenes have not changed a bit from the previous Indy movies, which is a good thing. Acting was good, and surprisingly Shia wasn't annoying this time. I recommend it to people looking for entertaining movies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1057,paul_vromen,"Mediocre in almost every way, alas.",5,24 June 2009,"Spielberg was setting himself up for defeat while making this movie, which went through development hell for some 15 years, all the while building up an obscene amount of hype that would be impossible to live up to. A bit like the Star Wars films, actually, only this feels like it has done a lot more damage to the Indy name. We had a nigh-on flawless trilogy: even the often maligned ""Temple of Doom"" was highly entertaining and frankly sported better effects than Indy's latest outing.What is it, then, that makes this fourth installment of one of the best film franchises ever such a let-down? The film works well on paper, but the execution is sub-standard. After an admittedly great opening scene, things go downhill pretty fast. For starters, the special effects are simply not good enough. The rodents, the apes, while meant for comic relief, look cheap and are over-used. The action sequences are often overblown, too implausible (Mutt's rope-swinging), and go on for far too long.Indy's adversaries, too, aren't threatening at all. Cate Blanchett, a gifted actress, just can't deliver, although the writing can probably be faulted here as well.Personally, my biggest problem with this movie is the total lack of tension between Indy and Marion. They had great chemistry in Raiders of the Lost Ark, where their constant bickering added great comic relief as well as portraying Marion as just being slightly unpredictable with regard to which side she was on. Here, she constantly looks at Indy with the admiration of a little schoolgirl.What partially redeems the film is Indy himself. I have absolutely no problems with Harrison Ford, who admittedly looks a little older, but fit enough to kick your twenty-something ass, let there be no mistake. I enjoyed Ray Winstone's and Shia LeBeouf's performances quite a lot as well.That said, ultimately this movie feels lazy, and that's typical of modern-day Spielberg, a once-great director who simply has too much power in Hollywood for his own good. The same can basically be said for Lucas. Let's hope these guys can cook up something fresh and exciting instead of tampering with their old franchises.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1058,rdufault,Luckily Lucas only had two franchises to ruin... so now he can stop.,2,17 October 2008,"Yup, George Lucas strikes again. I had such high hopes for this late-hitting sequel to the Indiana Jones movie and TV series... I should have known. Where to start? I might as well start with what worked... the entire opening sequence was great, high-energy, fun, and Harrison Ford pulled it off, until the, er, atomic bomb. I don't want to spoil the film for you folks, but Lucas was so gung-ho to throw in some 'fifties relevance, he didn't just bring in the McCarthyesque FBI goons... he also showed us a nifty atomic bomb test, complete with mannequin families hanging out at the barbecue. Thank goodness old kitchen appliances were lead-lined and equipped with shock absorbers. Oops, I strayed into the stuff that sucked, which was pretty much the rest of the film. Good... Harrison Ford. Old but good. He made the action stuff look easy. Great: Cate Blanchett. She's like Michael Caine with cheekbones - she is incapable of sucking in any role she plays, no matter how awful the movie. Hmm.. the good... Well, that was it. Now to the bad and worse. Bad Dialogue: stilted and awkward, as only ole George can write. The Indy and Marion stuff is almost physically painful to witness. The Indy and Mutt (no joke, the kid's name is Mutt...) dialog is also pretty weak. Characters: one-dimensional and... not true to themselves. Since when does Indy pontificate on the differences between quicksand (mud) and quicksand (sand) while sinking into the stuff? And Marion spent 20 years raising a love child in England and never told Indy? Action Sequences: too long, too much and wow that car chase scene through the jungle made it seem like the cars were on actual roads! How did they do that? Oh... of course, one of the trucks had tree-cutting blades on the front. And come on George... 10 guys in a truck driving right next to another truck all shooting AK 47s on full auto... and they hit nothing? Must have been using blanks. The whole feel of the car chase in the woods was that of a console game. I guess the game probably has the same scene in it. Ants: Holy crap, those were big CG scarabs - er - ants. Scarabs were in another movie. Crystal Skulls: what the hell? How does a 180 million dollar movie end up with a magnetically-charged elongated crystal skull as the driving force behind the plot? Who writes this stuff? Mysticism: George won't rest until we're all atheists, I swear to God. Remember Star Wars? Remember The Force, that mystical energy, generated by all living beings, that Jedi could use as a powerful ally? He turned it into parasites called Midichlorians that lived in a Jedi's blood. Midi-what? You're an idiot! Now all I need is a Jedi blood transfusion, and I can fly to Skywalker Ranch and zap George with lightning. So... in the previous Indiana Jones movies (except the second one, I guess), George takes a reverence for ancient Judaic relics and gives us the message, over and over, that God is Huge, and you don't screw with God - everyone who does screw with Him gets his head melted or exploded. So why on Earth in this train wreck of an action pic, wou8ld he now say - ""screw all of you! There is no God, just... (SPOILER HERE) ... Extra-dimensional aliens in a flying saucer"". Yes, not just from another planet, but Extra-dimensional, as told to us by one of the characters, who was driven mad by this knowledge (presumably when he read the script). Why one Earth do they have to be Extra-Dimensional if they're aliens anyway?Oh, yeah. This film had it all, except a cheesy wedding at the end. Oh, no, I was wrong. It had a cheesy wedding at the end. If you're into mindless, overblown action with weak plot, little character development, poor dialog and floating cars going over successively bigger waterfalls (Qui-Gon would have said... ""There's always a bigger waterfall!!"")... you should avoid this film like Typhus.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1059,christopherelawrence,All Good Except Plot (Interdiam Aliens),8,23 June 2008,"I liked this movie, for the most part. The action was good, the interactions between Indy and Mutt was good (recall that on the bike Mutt smiled and Indy was upset, the parallel being Indy and his father from Last Crusade)and seeing Marion Ravenwood again was good (""Marion Ravenwood is your mother?"" and the argument over Mutt in the truck). Hell, even the refrigerator bit was good, even if over the top. What bothered me was the whole inter-dimensional alien crap. Crystal Skulls? 13 that will explain everything and save the earth? I would have rather seen a return to the Ark of the Covenant (with the Soviets going after that) which would have been better considering Marion's return.Have you ever seen these people that believe in the Skulls? I saw a documentary on these beliefs, and those that do believe in it were dressed like they just came from Woodstock and spoke like they fell off the Rubber Truck. I would like to see a fifth film, again with Ford in the role that he made famous, and even with Indy married and with a son, but it would have to be with something more believable and true.Besides that, the movie was good, and others might like it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1060,Edward_fowler3,The Best since the original,10,25 May 2008,"I went and saw this movie yesterday and I don't think I've had this much fun at the movies in a long time! This is the best Indy film since the original. Possibly the best of the four. I think the only reason why so many other people on IMDb are trashing it is cause its been so long since the last one. Perhaps if it had come out at the time of the last trilogy it would not get trashed so much. But I think it is great! I liked the performances by Harrison Ford and Shia Labeouf! They had great screen chemistry! And so did Karen Allen in her return! Also, they didn't go overboard with the special effects which I liked also. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Four stars!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1061,jen5en,Then George Lucas came along...,1,22 May 2008,"When did I know that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull wasn't gonna be my cup of tea? It started 10 seconds after the Paramount logo was displayed and a CGI prairie dog came out of the ground. I was hoping it to be an Ice Age 3 teaser, but no, it was Indiana Jones. It was later confirmed again, when 3 of these poorly animated CGI cuties were having facial expressions while looking at Henry Jones himself.It confirmed my greatest fears; George Lucas had left a mark of his Crap-Midas touch: everything he touches will stink. Or, it will when he gets to say too much. The first 3 Star Wars without him as director were great, the 3 prequels after when he introduced us to Jar Jar Binks meant a trip to Poo-Poo Town. It's the same story with Indiana; too much cheese that doesn't belong there. Don't get me wrong here, Indiana movies have always been full of cheese and cute gimmicks, but they never ruined it. The little incidents like Indiana pulling his gun in a sword fight with a crazy Bedouin warrior, or his dad lighting an entire Nazi-hall on fire; these moments were classics, but lousy humor like CGI monkeys attacking a Russian convoy should never have been included. But it did and I think I know why.In short, it didn't feel like an Indy movie. Not because it was carried into the digital age with bravura, but because the spirit was completely gone. The only characters I could connect with were Dr. Henry Jones (of course) and Marion Ravenwood, but with Shia LeBeouf in the role as... well, Shia LeBeouf and Ray Winstone as Indy's long lost friend Mac we're all supposed to like all of a sudden, it feels foreign and in-cohesive. The USSR could've been a great and cunning adversary, but unlike the Nazi's who always seemed to have the edge in the previous 3 movies, the Russians seemed like 10-15 bad guys that just happened to be at the right place at the right time; they didn't feel like a military superpower hunting down Dr. Jones. Kate Blanchett actually performs well, but her character remains a figurehead that we know is unlikely to survive the end credits.The plot could have been great, and the transition from the 40's to the 50's interesting, but it was sadly poorly executed. Too much is spoon fed to us and by the time the plot is even mentioned, you know what it's gonna end up with.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was not fun for me, it wasn't ""Indy"" enough for me. I say this because I loved the previous three and rated them all '10' here on IMDb. But stupid gimmicks like Jar Jar Binks and CGI prairie hounds belong neither in Star Wars nor in an Indiana Jones movie.

The movie is set in the mid-to-late 50's, which definitely adds a ""newer"" feel to the movie, which is easy to get used to. Yet, at the same time, the movie will feel just like the old ones...I think this is what Lucas and Spielberg were shooting for. From the clumsy fighting scenes we've all grown to love, to the chemistry between Indy and Marion (positive or negative, I'll let you decide), you will most likely be grinning through the whole movie.

Furthermore I can't accept fact that same man directed ""Schindler's List"" and this... something. What happened to Mr Spielberg? Was that his evil twin?

What you are really hearing is the inner child who is crushed by this freakishly awful movie, crying out in desperation for something to hold on to.That's what I wanted to do throughout this movie. As it failed over and over to catch even a whiff of the original trilogy's flavor, my head sunk further into my hands.Complete with needless/cheesy looking CGI essential for any recent George Lucas movie, unforgivable dialogue, and all new levels of unrealistic scenes. And I don't mean scenes where the Ark uses magical power, because that's believable, I mean where there is no mystic power involved but things still happen that 10 year old kids won't even buy.I can't help from thinking that Lucas should be forced into retirement.

I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, liked the story, but thought some of the action sequences were quite unbelievable. I must admit I was a bit confused in the beginning as to where the thinly evolving story was headed. Of course Spielberg kept his formula of ""Indy"" shots,sounds, and sequences. Surprisingly, Shia Labeouf didn't ruin the movie for me like he has with... well... you know. The story may have been too much to conceive and put onto paper, and then filmed, but it was better than National Treasure. The rest of the characters only made the movie more enjoyable as we watch this adventure we've all been waiting for. Yes, some action sequences were crazy ridiculous (sword fights on moving cars, swinging from vines, waterfalls), but I say this to those that criticize the ""cheesiness"" and CGI; If these movie were made today and not in the 80's, they ALL would have CGI and digital enhancements.

This latest installment of ""Indiana Jones"" certainly looks its age.If it took this long for Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford to agree on a story/script, I would hate to have seen the other versions they turned down.The whole movie, with the exception of the motorbike chase scene, looked like it was filmed in a studio, in front of green-screen to save Spielberg and Ford the hassle of having to travel to any of the locations.The lighting was flat, no shadows, no contrast. Way too clean, way too ""modern"" in its look. It takes some talent to make a movie supposedly filmed using ""old style"" film actually look like it was shot digitally! As for the CGI - didn't the producers say it would be used sparingly?? And why did it look so fake? I thought Lucas owns ILM? The story was just shocking. A patchwork of action scenes, with no sense of continuity, characters appear out of nowhere, and for no reason. Karen Allen's character was instrumental in ""Raiders"" but here, she's simply a plot device. How very lazy. And what a waste of time employing John Hurt if he is not given any decent dialogue?!?!?!

It was the first movie I remember seeing in the theater and the first that made me excited about movies. Althgouh they didn't really compare to the original, the next two sequels were also great. After 20 years of waiting, we finally have a new addition to the Indiana Jones franchise: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (has it really been that long? wow!) The critics have been raving about it (for the most part) and the fans seem divided as to whether or not it's a good movie. Personally, I found it to be quite enjoyable. At least, I thought it was much better than I thought it was going to be. After the debacle that Lucas has made of the Star Wars franchise, I wasn't going to get my hopes up as to whether he and Spielberg would be able to deliver another decent Indiana Jones movie. So, I was presently surprised.Harrison Ford looks old, but comfortable in the role that defined him as an actor. Perhaps a little slower, but still full of the adventurous spirit that fans have come to know and love. It was also nice to see Karen Allen reprise her role of Marion Ravenwood and to shed some light on what exactly happened between them over the years. Shia Lebouf also did a decent job as Mutt Williams. He didn't totally embarrass himself like I thought he would.The plot itself was a little convoluted in places (especially the ending). However, what else would you expect from Lucas these days? There were also some pretty ""cheesy"" scenes (mostly having to do with Mutt), but, then again, they are in all of the Indiana Jones movies.

It all looks too familiar after the Mummy series, national treasure etc.As far as the plot goes, Spielberg has gone to his favorite tried and tested formula of aliens. I seriously doubt it this was necessary for an Indiana jones film.

For me, it was great seeing my childhood hero back and cracking the whip and whacking soldiers in the face, with the same classic punch foley sounds of the trilogy (and no other film ever!). I felt the opening dialog was awful, and corny and started getting worried but the first action scenes were real entertaining and the pace was well set and all the whole cast did a great job. I watched temple of doom and holy grail before going to see this and there are some scenes in those that seem over the top, but no one cared back then and now people say Crystal Skull's scenes are over the top, thats the magic of an adventure movie-you go see things you'll never see/experience, you should just immerse yourself in the reality of the story, thats what you paid for. I just let myself go with the familiar faces, places (tombs with lots of spider-webs), and themes like I did back when I was a kid. I walked out feeling as happy as that kid way back 19 years ago and the whole movie was a pleasant experience. I do agree the film would have gotten higher marks had some scenes been more realistic. I would still love to see another film with Harrison Ford (who did a great job, except his opening lines) along with Shia L. as his son and sidekick, developing the father son relationship further, teaching and passing on his knowledge. I hope George Lucas and Spielberg team up for another again and this time try to take more from everyone's responses and make it more plausible yet new for all viewers. I had nothing against the Alien thing, there are several theories about alien intervention in archeology and worship in the past, so it's fine and fits the whole 50's era piece real well.

I went in with an expectation of at least serious craftsmanship and dedication to a fantastic , but still somewhat plausible storyline . The beginning shots are promising , but the plot quickly devolves from fantastic to ludicrous . It somewhat revives on campus , with an unusual type of cameo from the late , great Denholm Elliot providing some of the action . One of the problems is the vaunted CGI which to my eye gives an aura of falseness without the quaintness of let's say the original King Kong's stop motion . The CGI also seems to make filmmaker's just pile on effects like a drunk piling on drinks without regard to consequences , in this case the story line . This is one reason the ending in the jungle borders on moronic , yet the real ending of real people works . When they ended up back in the Amazon with a skull , a story somewhat coming full cycle from the original's opening might have worked better . It all come's back to STORY , STORY , STORY and PEOPLE , PEOPLE , PEOPLE ; not piling on effects for the sake of doing so , which is the way of so many of the current ""adventure"" crop ; one would expect more from Spielberg,Lucas,Ford et al .

1075,anwdavis,Indiana Jones IV: Why?,1,27 May 2008,"So begins my long awaited resignation to any ideas of future Lucas or Spielberg films.If this movie is a tribute to the fans, then I dislike how Lucas and Spielberg think of us. Some have written, ""We are missing film magic."" Some responded that that expectation is absurd. As far as ""film magic"", what are we trying to grasp? Is it those satisfied fantasies viewers had as children, or is it something more than that that all movie viewers look for? Even if you ask a child, she will tell you in her own words what that something is. Defined simply, it is the story. The viewers' chore ahead is to unmask the story, to unmask their interpretations. The magic spawns out of that, being an active spectator. Once you are in a story it is hard not to gravitate toward characters. It is hard not to be in the story, in the events at their side. All of this implied of course to be a result of good writing, which is absent from this film. Spectators enter theaters or the comforts of their home knowing what is going to happen because it is a familiar character, situated in familiar events. These viewers also know this is the last adventure which isn't as exciting as the first. So there is a low energy factor to keep in mind. Everyone there is banking on how it ends. I have retracted this paragraph about who wrote the script, knowing it is out of place, and I argued after that that the story takes Indy into an illogical direction. That is not entirely true. Underlying this work, at its core is an implied commentary on the genre of films this series spoofs. Knowing Indiana Jones movies are a tribute to the 1930's action heroes, one will draw from the film that Indy and his series could never make it in this day and age. Indy does not die, however. Instead he marries and starts a new life, one would assume as he tosses his hat off to Shia LaBeouf's character. Maybe that is what is so painful about this movie, Harrison Ford tossing his hat off to no other than the lead character of Transformers, and all that particular symbolism conjures. That is very irksome, for I would much rather see Indy die in an adventure, which would be as painful as watching Optimus Prime die in Transformers The Movie, granted, but would be more fitting. Have one of the aliens kill Indy. Now, we would be getting somewhere, maybe Shia picks up Indy's hat and goes ape like Rambo, obviously upset because he too grew up with Indy. The message is fully clear. What was the purpose of making this film anyway? My answer to you, dear viewers, is what drives the entertainment industry: money.George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have lost their knack for creativity, and storytelling, in order to spend huge amounts of money on cgi and over elaborate scenes that take away from the story and leave nothing to the imagination.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1076,rocaeljulio,How a mountain becomes a molehill,1,28 May 2008,"Recently i've been to Paris and take a seat in the worst restaurant of the world (as i would call it). Poor service, stupid employees, brackish food and every minute i've been waiting for the food it became even worse. first i got really angry, but after two hours waiting for the diner, i started laughing, cause what else can you do? Well there might be one or two viewers of the latest Indiana Jones flick, who are reminded on there movie-experience. i must say, that i (like so many others) am a real fan of the original trilogy (as a kid, i even wanted to study archeology because of the movies so don't tell me anything).Watching the new one, there was one point where i disbelieved in what i'm seeing. It's definitely just like someone else but not steven spielberg tried to make an Indiana Jones Movie (guy with the hat, whip, the evil ones, action, some artefacts, some sidekicks, oh yes! the music). Thats exactly the feeling you get. In one sentence: I cant believe that they really did this crap! Uninspired dialogues, uninspired acting, uninspired music (hey wake up, john williams, the movie is over!), confusing screenplay and an unbelievable overdone ending. No charm, no atmosphere, no suspense, no nostalgia. The one point i gave that movie is for the honest commentary of spielberg on his own movie: cause what do you see at first in the movie? exactly: how a mountain becomes a molehill.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1077,michaelpoteet,Great Indy Film!!,8,20 June 2021,"First off, don't listen to any of the reviews you may have ever heard or read about this film. I loved it! I think it meets the High Indiana Jones standards. Most people complain about the plot. Like the existence of aliens is any stranger than ripping out the heart of a living, breathing human? Or that the ark of the covenant possessed lightning bolts and energy that makes people's skin melt off?This movie was well received. It was great to see the Indiana Jones story continue. I am going to try and explain the movie without giving away spoilers.Older Indy. New young sidekick. The desert. Russians. South America. The Mayans. Crystal Skull. Treasure Map. Double Secret Agents. Pyramids. Swordplay. Cool motorcycle scene.Check it out for yourself if you're a fan of the first 3 Days Indiana Jones films, you will like this one. Can't wait for the new Indiana Jones movie!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1078,Lorem-Ipsum,Disappointing and truly awful.,1,23 May 2008,"From the opening credits this film demonstrated how poorly produced it is. Where Shia LaBeouf gets an ""And...Shia LaBeouf"" credit...I'm sure there's an industry term for that...but, what about John Hurt..? Isn't he a more accomplished actor? Isn't the whole plot revolving around his character? Not some MTV-input punk attempting to make this franchise more accessible to a new generation.And surviving a thermo-nuclear blast at ground zero...by shutting himself in a supposed lead-lined...""fridge""..? What the blazes is that all about?! What would have been better...is to have Indiana Jones in more of a thriller type film now...given his age. Why not take The Da Vinci Code for example...and have Indiana Jones solving something like this.The only dialog Harrison Ford has is in speech form. His only other coverage on camera is to give a wry, father-like smile to his new-found, annoying son. What happened to Indiana Jones being the centre of the film? Throughout this entire movie I was more interested in opening my sweets than I was in anything that happened to any of the characters.Talk about spoon feeding. The portrait of Marcus Brody on the wall - nice touch. And just in case anyone in the audience missed it...we have the statue as well later on. Overkill.Why were there so many many references to Raiders? We can see the hanger is where the Ark was put...we don't have to see it...just in case it was too subtle..!! Duh.And what about Temple of Doom? There's not one reference to that. And it was a better film than Last Crusade.The best bit in this whole film...was the Paramount mountain fading into the ant hill. Nice contrast to the opening of Raiders. And that, sadly, was it.This is so, so very disappointing from the collective talents of Spielberg and Lucas. I wonder what we would have been given if it was just Spielberg...and not Lucas. We've already seen how George and his continental-sized chin has descended into sub-standard movie-making with the Star Wars prequels.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1079,MetalDuck,Indy returns with a BANG,8,25 May 2008,"I'm going to star by saying the only reason some people are making this movie seem so much more worse than it is is only because George Lucas chose to add a Science Fiction aspect to the Indiana Jones series. I actually think the ""aliens"" fit quite well into the new Indy movie. It's just because people were expecting it to be totally different it why people have been saying that it isn't ""hip"" to add a new futuristic aspect to a rather well defining series of film.But on the good side, I think this movie delivers a whole new type of generation and mixing in Aliens with a Mayan-old treasure hunt is a good way to return a series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1080,bestrob263,best one yet,10,21 May 2008,"I have been a huge fan of Indiana Jones and loved the first 3 movies. When I went to the pre screening it blew my mind how incredible the 4th one could be years later. This is the best one yet and if you miss out on this movie it will be the biggest mistake ever. The plot is as original as the first 3 and the acting was beautiful, the story line couldn't have went any better. This was such an amazing experience to see on the big screen as well. This was directed so well. I didn't think Speilburg could still pull it off. I really do not know what else I can say about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull except for the part that you must see this yourself for your own reaction. I will not release any spoilers for you. I really would not be surprised if this film makes the top of the IMDb 250 just like the first Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1081,jas82,I would have rather watched 2 hours of C-span in subtitles,2,27 May 2008,"I'll start off this review by saying that if you're an Indiana Jones fan, you should see this movie just for the sake of saying you gave it a chance (regardless of the disappointment to follow). If you're not a fan, just stray away, and enjoy the earlier films. If you're under 13 years old and love CGI and Shia Labeuf - go ahead and fund our slumping economyThe plot:Despite Harrison Ford's age, he pulls off the role. He's still the hero we want in Indiana Jones, and the story tries to play with his age by setting us in the 1950's (around 20 years after the last installment). If you do some research into the crystal skulls they actually do exist, and a lot of factual references are made to them in the movie (Mitchell-Hedges skull, skulls being at the British museum), so there is some ground for a decent story line that can follow the mystery around these (currently regarded as manufactured) anomalies. However, instead of playing into the traditional Indiana Jones occult story, this movie tangents off into a combination of Close Encounters and X-Files. Which was very disappointing...it just didn't make me feel I was watching Indiana Jones. I yearned for the classic humor, simple but effective story, and quality characters.Bad guys: OK, yes I get that we couldn't be with Nazis anymore, it's the 50's. But there could have been so much more done with the Commi's than what we saw. Let's do something with Tesla coils or nuclear weapons...something that actually posed threats to the world...not ""mind control."" Irina Spalko (Blanchett) was not the least bit intimidating. Her goal to turn us all into Commi's was just lame, her weapon of choice (for no apparent reason) is the rapier, which seems to only be there just to create a sword fight later in the movie. When they were making this movie I felt as though they had all the tools, the vehicles, the costumes, they just didn't have any ""motivation"" for the characters to make them evil enough. They were all pretty much mindless actors kicked out of 5-tons or eaten by recycled carnivorous insects (The Mummy) with nothing really interesting to say or do. The most fearsome opponent was the Russian General, who could have been so much more had the initial brutality shown in the killing of the gate guards continued through the movie (remember Heinrich Himmler from ""Last Crusade""?). Instead he's rocketed across the desert and that's pretty much it from him.The Aliens: Are they bad guys? I don't understand, 13 crystal skeletal aliens become 1 real alien, and decide that after getting their missing skull back should kill everything they see and take off (what was the gift?! maybe it was to the audience by finally killing off Blanchett's character and bringing an end to the movie!), and what happened to the alien in the body bag, what was the actual significance of breaking into Area 51 and stealing the corpse (which the Russians already had a few of?), when apparently the only skull everyone was after was hidden behind some long dead adventurer in some Mayan ruins.George McHale: Who the hell are you and why do we care?! You helped Indy out when you were secret agents, you say you have plenty of money, and yet you're so ridden with greed you kill yourself for some gold. You had no input in the story, and your part could have been transferred into funds for better stunt work. His part in the movie was actually detrimental, and just added more confusion to a lacking storyline.CGI: OK, the first three Indiana Jones were made without the use of CGI and with a smaller budget, why the need for so much in this movie. We have CGI for pointless gophers, unremarkable (and unnecessary) tarzan like jungle romps, monkeys, giant ants, aliens, just about everything exciting that was filmed on location in the originals was CGI'd to no end, and not even that impressively. If they could do it on location for Jurassic park, why not this? What happened to making this movie so that it gives you the feel of an adventure movie? Mutt Williams and Marion Ravenwood: Mutt Williams (MUTT?! couldn't think of anything more creative?) a stubborn teen caught in the Greaser movement who refuses to go anywhere without his Harley and a comb was not a terrible addition to the Indy lineup, but he was often just awkwardly injected into the action. The vine scene was just ridiculous, and not even fun to watch (seemed to just be there for cheap laughs in an otherwise dull chase seen). Bring the Harley to the Jungle? Who agreed on that one? Marion Ravenwood (Indy fans will remember her from Raiders) is a shallow reflection of her former self. Always smiling, and always trying to get the quick verbal jab in on Indy was often out of place in the midst of the action scenes, it was nice to see them try to incorporate something out of the earlier movies, but it would have been nicer to see some more impressive acting out of her, not just there for comic relief and a tie in to Shia Labeuf.Overall, I felt this movie was a very disappointing addition. The only thing that kept me interested were the references to the other Indy movies and the shards of facts I could pick up about the crystal skulls that I had read prior to seeing the movie. If you're an Indy fan I'm sure you'll be disappointed and a little embarrassed if you get all excited and bring a friend who's not familiar with the series (like I was with my buddy in disbelief at what crap he was watching). This is an OK movie for Indy fans, a terrible movie for those who haven't seen the others.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1082,Lawrie-5,First Half Is Good - Second Half Not So Much,6,1 June 2008,"When I first heard that we would be getting another Indy movie, I was looking forward to it despite almost twenty years from the previous instalment.To kick things off, the film has some great action set pieces but none live up to the previous films, the first half of the film has a real fun feel to it, reminding you of the excitement the other films gave you, but as you drift in the second half of the film you gradually begin to think that the film has lost all. I will not mention much more on the film but I was disappointed in what came of the climax.The characters are on the other hand are as great as ever but Cate Blanchett's character is so annoying, and the character so predictable and cardboard like.One other thing is one of Indy's trademark 'The Whip' is not used no where near as much as it could of done in this instalment.Overall its an alright film probably worth waiting for on DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1083,bnbrossman,The end of an era...,8,31 May 2008,"People hate seeing something they love end, or even see an end coming. So many of us all love Indiana Jones movies, and the idea that the character would get old... that's just what we don't want to see right? Well I did, I don't want some jerk-off make a new Indiana Jones movie in the future starring Justin Timberlake instead of Harrison Ford just so we can see Indiana beating up Nazis for the Lost City of Atlantis or Alexander the Great's laser disco ball (yes, that's a reference to Tomb Raider).Indy is an old man now, but not the diapers and walkers type, the kick@$$ belligerent type. For those paying attention, Harrison Ford did an awesome job during the right points of the movie acting like Indy's recently deceased father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery). The fact that he discovers the existence of his son, Henry Williams aka Henry Jones III, allows the story to continue, as now Indiana Jones will take an ever increasing backseat in he and his son's adventures. This is the way of things, and is really the only way to preserve the character. Not as some 2-D comic book character who's been the same age for the last 30 years, but instead a changing and dynamic character who has gone from student, to hero and is now beginning his life as a mentor.For me, the story can continue. And just like Indiana Jones having to change with the times, so shall the story. The 1940s had given way to the age of technology, and by 1957 the world was fully embraced in the Nuclear Age. The fact that Lucas managed to make small references to Rosewell without making it the basis of the movie was quite impressive. They cite these different modern myths and shuck them away like corn husks to get to the corneal of truth underneath. Yes it was Sci Fi, but no it was not aliens from space, inter-dimensional beings for those paying attention, and the Crystal Skull they find looks nothing like the ones currently out there in the real world.In the end, those who hate the movie never really intended to like it in the first place, and the majority are nothing more than disenchanted Star Wars fans. There were a few parts I didn't like, and they reminded me of things added at the last minute by some fresh out of college kid who majored in theater and/or film. Yes, it was the 'monkeys on vines' scene. But hey, no movie is perfect, and I can overlook a mistake or two, unlike National Treasure, where the whole movie was a horrible mistake.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1084,andrefbento,Promising beginning but overall very disappointing...,3,22 May 2008,"First, let me explain that I am not an Indiana Jones detractor... I was born in 1980 and had the opportunity to watch Indiana Jones and the last crusade in the cinemas when I was a kid, and I really adore it. I am also one of those fanatics who have watched the first two movies of the trilogy for dozens of times... Although I am now a growned up 27 years old adult and I like to watch more ""serious"" movies, I continue to appreciate entertainment movies with lots of adventures, laughable moments and special effects! I recently reviewed the trilogy before going to watch Indy 4, and of course I was not so fascinated as I was 20 years ago, yet I still liked the comic moments, the unrealistic action scenes, the irreverence and spontaneousity of Indy, overall the adventure spirit of the saga. Thus, I was eager to go back to the theater and enjoy Indy 4.The beginning of the movie is very enjoyable... With the exception of the stupid atomic bomb sequence, the race in the beginning which immerses us in the 50s spirit, the action sequence at the warehouse, the dialogs and other action sequence with Indy's son were OK and I could really feel the ""Indy spirit"" in that movie...I think that the problems start when Indy and the kid travel to Perú and search for the skull in the cemetery... From then on, I got the feeling that I was watching other person playing an Indy graphic adventure in play station... With the difference that I remember one or two of those video games with better scripts! Actually, I don't even understand a great part of the dialogs between Indy and his son about the skull, and the traces they use to find it... It remembers me of the condensated dialogs used in the Da Vinci Code, when Tom Hanks could decipher the most difficult codes in seconds and the time we were trying to understand the method he used, he was already deciphering another....As for the romantic scenes, we all know Harrison Ford is not a specialist in that nor were we expecting to see a love movie, but come on... They could at least create some realistic emotional tension between him and Karen Allen. I really felt no connection with what was happening, and they had so much material, with that background of raiders of lost ark... The story is so concerned with the action, that they cannot make a pause for a romantic moment. Indy and Marion have to talk about their private lives when they are about to die drowned in moving sands, or when they are held prisoners at a truck while a URSS soldier tries to put a handkerchief in the mouth of Marion... So, so touchy, isn't it?...The action scenes are quite disturbing... I know that we were used to see impossible things happening in the former episodes of the saga... But come on... Indy not dying in an atomic bomb explosion that has throwned the fridge he got inside in to miles away from the epicentre and he has just got out and had a well humored chat with some FBI agents thereafter, without even having a scratch... Indy's son using the jungle ropes like if he was spider man... There were two or three scenes that have spoiled the movie, I think.I would give this movie a 3 out of 10 for the ""Indy spirit"" that Harrison ford has preserved in his acting, some nice jokes (the motorcycle entering into the university was quite pleasant:)) and not su much more...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1085,pintousmcff-1,George Lucas was coked up when he made this movie,1,22 June 2013,"I was actually a key grip for this movie. Let me tell you the things I saw working on set were criminal. We began shooting with absolutely no script. Everyday George Lucas would arrive on set high on methamphetamines and Red Bull. He would write the day's script on a cocktail napkin and handed it to the actors to read. He would fire people spontaneously for no reason. He fired a guy for being an Eskimo even though he was a Korean guy. Steven Spielberg literally phoned it in for this film. He was banging Barbra Streisand and wanted to insert her into as many scenes as possible.

Harrison Ford still pulls it off as an aged hero, and although most of the movies far-fetched story lags in it's pace, the action, once it gets going, is classic Indy. It's easy to pull this movie apart  and I'm sure I won't be the last to do so, but the pull of Indiana Jones will still win all but hardened audiences over by the end. 4/10 for the plot. 9/10 for the ILM effects. 10/10 for effort from Harrison Ford to make this work  and it does - just.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The character development was quite lacking at times, especially in Cate Blanchett's character. And the overall concept of Aliens in an Indiana Jones movie is subjective, but I think the idea could have been better executed.SPOILER: A major weakness - and likely George Lucas move - early on, was the ridiculous nuclear explosion sequence. Now Indy movies typically bend the rules a lot, but this is going too far...much more implausible than the ridiculous raft sequence of Temple of Doom.Now I know George Lucas and Spielberg say that ""if you go back, you'll see how bad our movies actually were."" But in actuality, they were excellent for the period in which they were created. This duo shouldn't have rested on their laurels with this one and should have attempted to update the movie for today's cinema-goer, instead of snobbily smacking us in the face with this pointless retread.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1088,jboyd546,Decent story line spoiled by a few OTT scenes and poor CGI,7,1 June 2008,"I am a huge fan of the original movies, ranking Raiders as one of my top 10 movies of all time. When i heard that the new movie was going to be shot in the same way as the original 3 with the actors doing their own stunts i was really excited and couldn't wait to see it.I final went to see it last Monday and i was impressed with most of it except for the final 15 minutes and one over the top seen involving vines. One other disappointment was poor quality CGI, with a budget as large as this movie was sure to have had i think that they could have made a better effort, Spielberg's war of the worlds was made 3 yrs previous and still managed better effects than Indy (some may recognise this situation which is almost identical to that of I Am Legend).In conclusion the movie kept true to the original trilogy in the sense of thrilling chase scene and exciting set pieces (opening and concluding scenes). Parts of the story go a bit overboard and the CGI lets it down but overall the movie provides and enjoyable 2 hours of entertainment, just don't expect anything as grand as the original three (Bar temple of Doom).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Nostalgia clouds the real picture, that the fourth installment could have been better. Young viewers or those who are new to the Indy universe would be confused and would not understand Indy's fear of snakes or why he and Marion argues a lot. This movie is primarily for those who have seen the first three movies, its like a reunion of old friends. It was a bit of a shock to see this ""old friend"" looks so old but once he started saying the first sarcastic line and used his whip, it was unmistakably the Indy of old. If you come in with high expectations you might be disappointed but if its a fun movie you are looking for, this is highly recommended.

1092,Shilshadu,Indiana Jones: Revolutionized,10,25 May 2008,"Overview- a well thought out storyline, forgivable cliché villains, great action scenes, jaw dropping special effects + Indiana Jones = A Great TimeAll i have to say is Indiana Jones is back, in an explosive way. It starts out introducing the badguys, after kidnapping Jones and Mack. They force Indy to help them, yada yada, Indy escapes after a hilarious revisit to the first movie by showing the Arc of the Covenant. Moves on with Jones escaping via rocketcar and ends up with him stumbling upon a weapons test zone, he gets blown up, saved by a lead refrigerator, and makes his way back to his teaching job. he gets fired, yada yada, queuer shia lebauf calling on jones to help him. A very funner Greaser vs. Jock moment, then there in the thick of the story after visiting Oxley's sanitarium cell. It moves briskly after that, they find a skull, get captured, meet Marian again, yada yada, i'm not going to give much more away. The ending was very satisfying, it's an explosive entrance for Indiana Jones for the New Age. I hope they do more in the future. Great Fun, Great Fun.... It stands on its own, better than Temple of Doom, and the Raiders of Lost Arc, about as funny as Last Crusade, and just a plain good follow up to welcome indy back.

How many more young people will die because of this grossly irresponsible and stupid film. Will the death toll also extend to children playing in old fridges copying what they saw in the movie's most excessively stupid and totally irrelevant sequence. Then there is the film's opening scenes with a car load of young people harassing other law abiding motorists. What are the producers telling us here? ""Go for it kids. A bit of Road Rage is good fun!"" As for the plot-did it really have one? Did anybody really care. The writers obviously couldn't decide which side Ray Winstone's character was on.He seemed to change sides every few minutes. Even Jones seems confused at the end,and who wouldn't!

1094,Fumbled,Lucas and Steve: 'they no nuts! they crazy!',5,29 May 2008,"What is this? Come on guys. This just seems like abuse to fans everywhere. If you want to see the Phantom Menace of Indiana Jones, here it is. Low and behold, the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls.Let's start out by saying, I couldn't care less or more for CGI effects. I think they're fine. I don't think it detracts from anything here, however fake looking some of it maybe. I guess that's part of the charm in a production. To see some of the ingenuity (good or bad) that they come up with to make this film, which makes us feel closer to the movie making process.What I do have a problem with is the bad plot and the flat characters followed by terrible pacing. I will tell you there will be two, possibly 3, characters you definitely won't care about. That would be Mac, Spalko and possibly Oxley. Mac's motivations seem cliché and his character is hardly developed. We know what he's going to do, no one loves or hates him during the whole film. He serves as the frustrating character. That guy who might be funny because he's round and apparently British. But no. If you thought he'd be the Sallah or Marcus, you were wrong. He's a bore. Spalko on the other hand, the main villain, is also quite nonthreatening and weak. I know they intentionally made her a cliché strong Russian/dominatrix type woman. However, she seems incapable of harming anything more than a fly (or ant) as much as she threatens. It's really a pity since I wanted her to really show everyone she meant business and at first when she was introduced I really thought she was going to do some evil ass kicking. Oxley is more of a plot device so I'll just skip over him.Then there's the transition of these sequences. They're bad. The first 45 minutes or so I feel like Indy's back! This isn't bad! They reintroduced our hero, gave him a sidekick, fought the baddies already, etc. everything feels right.But then they actually travel to the archaeological site and it's over from there. About halfway, we are revealed the whole plot and secret of the film (which most of us already could have guessed from the first sequence) but now they lay it out on the table for us wide and clear. ""This is the secret to the artifact, this is why we want it!"" As you could've guessed by the casting list, they even bring Karen Allen (Marion) back. She is bad. She makes the atmosphere even more nonthreatening when she fills the screen with her happy smiles, even at gunpoint, even when a loved one is at gunpoint. Smile smile happy happy. After a few explosive sequences (which weren't bad, except for a few very cheesy scenes involving Mutt), they find where they want to go, and we see a very predictable ending that most of us saw coming around the corner halfway through the film.I did like seeing Indiana again. Seeing Harrison Ford put on that fedora back on for the first time in this film really got me, and the whole audience excited. It struck a nostalgic chord deep in our hearts. He has the same sarcastic and humorous lines as the previous films. The only thing missing here is his ability to outwit the enemy. If you are looking for scenes like in the Last Crusade where he turns on the Nazi motorboat, let's it coast down the river, then while the Nazi soldiers are getting in a second boat to follow the dummy boat, Indiana busts out of a nearby crate in a motorcycle giving him a head start advantage, you will be disappointed. There are no such scenes where you see Indiana use his ingenuity to defeat or outsmart his enemies in this one. Rather just lots of swinging around and punching some Soviet faces. This time also they make him take a slight backseat. Instead of him taking the lead, it's Mutt and Marion who drive the motorcycle or drive the car fearlessly into danger, while passenger Indiana says ""no, that's dangerous"" or ""too fast.""The payoff when seeing this movie is seeing Indiana Jones the character. The simple and straightforward plot however leaves you feeling empty. You'll know what is going to happen and how it's going to end and when it does you won't be impressed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1095,Mickjmor,I Liked It For What It Was!,7,14 May 2012,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull definitely delivers, Harrison Ford can still pull off a great Indy for his age at 65 and the legacy still lives on with him being the same way he was in personality & attitude 19 years ago from the events of ""The Last Crusade"". I do believe some of the special effects was unneeded and especially the annoying over the top flying saucer scene at the end! But despite all that, it still is a worthy sequel to watch if your a true Indy fan! It has Fun Moments, Some Pleasuring Moments, Exciting Moments , Joyful Moments & just a sure great time with the other characters involved with the return of Karen Allen's fun ""Marion Ravenwood"", Cate Blanchett's great female portrayal of an evil villain Irina Spalko, Ray Winstone's fun & quirky deliverance of the character ""Mac"" as the confused friend/partner of Indy's & Shia Labeoufs likable & funny performance as Mutt Williams. I Liked it for what it was & you should too, I give it 9 stars out of 10!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1096,Leon_Salmon@hotmail.com,George has lost his touch with writing.....,4,25 May 2008,"Spielberg should have knew when he read the script, the whole thing feels like an excuse just to bring Indy back....and thats it. The first big plus of this film is Harrison, for 65 he looks great. Then the big negatives, the script just doesn't cut it, the clues and story are awful and just lack any excitement. Lucas has now ruined two excellent cinematic trilogies. I'm even now wondering whether he had anything to do with them in the first place, did he possibly get some genius to write them for him and take the credit, because after the Phantom Menace and Clones, you would hardly believe the same guy wrote Empire or Raiders.I could go on but I have a lot of respect for Spielberg and Harrison, for me Indy will always end with him and his Father riding off into the sunset. This story wouldn't even pass in a Tomb Raider movie or a Young Indy episode.INDY WILL ALWAYS BE A TRILOGY....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1097,Firedoomcaster,Jease! Why do people criticize this so much!,10,12 July 2008,"I disagree with almost every comment on this movie! I am a major fan of all the Indiana Jones movies. I'd just like to tell most of these people that they really had their expectations set too high! What did they expect? Something completely amazing that would blow them away and be much better then all of the movies combined? I bet they did and were therefore disappointed! I for one loved this movie! It made me smile from ear to ear by the end. Movies are not made to impress the critics! They are made to impress the audience! Making a critic smile is just a bonus! (lord knows they could rarely show any emotion at anything). I do not blame the Steven Spielberg or George Lucas. I blame the way movies are made and thought of today! You never see classically told stories like E.T. or the original Star Wars any more. You just see fast paced action movies with no real character build up, movies completely taken over by special effects, movies based on books or plays or insulting or romantic comedies with stereotypical characters in more outrages and unrealistic settings. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a revival of a dying art of story telling that should never be forgotten. I had my doubts at first that Harrison Ford could pull it off as Indiana Jones at his age, but he was stunning! His acting was believable and excellent and he actually looked like the Indiana Jones of the past except with grey hair and a few more smile lines. Shila LeBof (Spelling?) surprised me. He was incredible with his James Dean look of the 1950's and his comb being used whenever he was stressed. The sets were beautiful. I don't care if the story line was slightly far-fetched to include aliens, I was so wrapped up in the adventure of it all that I really didn't give a damn. And come on! Its not as far-fetched as some of the previous stories, AKA: An ark that contains spirits that melt the faces of villains and the legend of the Holy Grail. The alien skeletons were sculpted to perfection and I would have felt privileged to stand in their throne room. The only things I could have done without were the animated gofers and the line: ""I thought you were my friend."" But its a Lucas story. You have to allow for the odd cheesy line at some points. All in all, this was a fantastic family movie for all to see. The characters are well built and go through some amazing turns, the special effects are not over used and are spectacular, the acting is beyond comparison and the subtle comedy is hilarious and beautifully directed. Well done George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! Its just too bad that so many people these days are so level headed and ungrateful! Otherwise this would be classed as a masterpiece! It certainly is in my books!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1098,crmang,The truth about the movie must be told,1,29 May 2008,"Sure, we can forgive the lack of realism in the stunts and the cheesiness of the action scenes. But the movie seemed like a satire of the old Indy movies. There was no chemistry between the actors, the action sequences were long and uninteresting, and put together it was not a very well made film. Moviegoers shouldn't be told that our expectations are off to compensate for a low-rate movie, we should be commended for warning others of this debacle. This movie milked millions of dollars primarily because of reputation and not of substance, and that's what is upsetting. For the many who support this movie for whatever reason, realize that both your time and your money is on the line, neither of which should be compromised for nostalgia.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1099,lotrfanboy900,"""I Have a Bad Feeling About This""",4,22 May 2008,"I finally got my hands on the novelization the day before the movie opened. I had been preparing my self for the new Indy for about a year. I had watched ""Raiders"" and ""Last Crusade"" again and again. I even bought a second hand copy of ""Temple of Doom"", which my very conservative parents had not allowed me to see as a child. I played ""Emperor's Tomb"", read about Indy's life, bought ""The Young Indiana Jones"", and even created my own sequel, ""Indiana Jones and the Hunt for Excaliber"". My sister read the book aloud to me on a car trip. She read for about five hours, and my hopes began to sink. I loved the beginning (same with the movie), and we both thrilled when Spalko began to talk about a box: could it be the ark? Then we found out it was not. Instead, it was a mummy, OF AN ALIEN! What the Bleep! Are you serious? It went downhill from there. I was really disappointed when I found out that Lucas was using the stupid idea of ""El Dorado"". Hasn't that been done a hundred times (much better might I add) before? Shia Le- well I'm not even going to try to spell his name. Shia was great as Mutt, and was perhaps one of the only decent new characters. Besides him though, this movie was a shambles, and did I mention there were Aliens! WHY? Why? WHY? The thing that really makes me mad, is George Lucas. Where does that old *bleep* get off destroying my favorite childhood movies! First it was the appalling new Star Wars trilogy, and now Indiana Jones! George, I know your life goal is to have a character in each movie you direct say ""I have a bad feeling about this"", but it's not the fan's dreams. And you know, that's kind of the whole point here. George Lucas, you haven't betrayed Shiva, you've betrayed the fans!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1100,RandomNoob,Realism is gone,6,22 June 2008,"Indiana jones and the Crystal skull is a nice movie. But isn't like the movies before. They had a to big of a budget and now everything that happens is over the top. This is very sad because now the feel of indy is gone and the time the movie takes place isn't seriously anymore. Again its over the top Hollywood and you get tired of very fast. Also I thought raiders of the lost arch was weird but this time its with aliens but still the story was pretty good only the action and stunt where over the top and ruined the movie for me. I wanted to see indy like the the old days only a bit older but now it looks like a cheap movie with all the big stunts and like they thought ""lets do things big then people must love it!""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Having such heavyweight Hollywood types involved in this movie, I expect far better than this. Yes, the movies made zillions at the box office, only because everyone expected something much better. If this had a money back guarantee on enjoying the movie, a lot of money would have been paid back.What is up with movies these days? The only movies that seem to be any good these days are remakes from years ago - why can't do they do good original material anymore?

Come on.This is ridiculous.According to some comments they say 'What's wrong about this? The same happened in previous Indy Series'Yes they did. But that was 10 years ago. The world and film industry has changed. If you still enjoy the same, get the products of 10 years ago but I have changed, the world has changed, Indy has to change. Unfortunately he changed in a bad way by getting older.Finally, I did not enjoy the movie and it was a great disappointment especially for those who grew up with Indiana Jones movies.Regards, Gokcin Kabasakal",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1103,rob-macklin,Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible Terrible,1,25 May 2008,"What a massive disappointment.I've been looking forward to this new Indy ever since it was announced and I can't remember a time when a movie has let me down as badly as this one. It was embarrassing, cringe-worthy, humiliating and vomit inducing from the start to the finish.I think the end of it for me was when Mutt, played by the hopelessly inept Shia Lebouf (I don't even care if that's the correct spelling or not) was swinging through the trees with monkeys Tarzan style. The group I was with groaned aloud when that happened.But that was just one part of it. There were endless scenes of total insanity all throughout the movie. Like when Indy jumps into a fridge to survive a nuclear explosion. Yep, someone actually thought that idea up and they put it in the movie.I can't believe Spielberg attached his name to this turkey. There was none of the old Spielberg magic in this at all. You can always tell when he's done a movie but with this you can't. It's soooo awful I will never watch it again. I have tried to force it out of my memory so that the previous three remain unspoiled.The scene where they drive through the jungle and have sword-fights is way too long and too stupid and too boring and too pointless. Nothing new there at all and it seemed to go on for half the movie.Another scene that made me cringe was the fight between Indy and some Russian clown. How many times does Indy have to be punched in the head before they call it quits? That went on way too long as well and became ridiculous as Indy got punched another 700 times.Speaking of Indy, Harrison Ford looked ancient. What with his scragy face, skinny legs, weak voice, he looked like he was 100 years old. Such a shame as he was so awesome in his prime. Now he just looks absurdly out of place.Shia Lebouf is an idiot. I was concerned when I heard he was in the movie as he was an idiot in Transformers. I really don't see the appeal. He's a terrible actor with no depth or substance and there was zero chemistry between him and Ford. When he first makes his appearance in the movie, trying to look like Marlon Brando in The Wild One, I nearly hurled. And he gets worse from there.There are no laughs in the movie and any attempt to do so only makes you feel like you're being treated like a child. And I think that must be what the makers of this turkey are aiming at. They have gone for the target audience of 6 to 8 year olds who have never seen any of the other Indy films.A few thoughts on some of the other characters in this madness: John Hurt, one of the great English actors of all time, mumbles and dribbles like a fool throughout the entire movie. You can't help but squirm whenever he is on screen.Karen Allen, once so beautiful and so feisty, ends up disgracing herself in this dirge. I felt uncomfortable every time she appeared.And top the whole insanity off, Indy and Marion get married at the end of the movie with everyone laughing and cheering like clowns.My advice...avoid it like the plague! Or wait for it to come out on weekly DVD hire and get it out and enjoy hating it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1104,tracampanella,Lucas...why did it have to be Lucas?,2,28 May 2008,"There's a line early in the film where Jim Broadbent tells Indy that someone has died and says ""We're at the point where life takes away more than it gives."" This line, unfortunately, is a metaphor for the film. Time, it seems, has taken away Lucas and Spielbergs talent.In many press interviews leading up to the film Lucas bragged about how he came up with the ""MacGuffin"" and how he knew in his heart of hearts that this MacGuffin was the only MacGuffin that could work in a fourth Indy film. He even went as far to say that he fought for his MacGuffin and refused to see a script that did not incorporate it. Well, the MacGuffin is one of THREE main reasons this film is terrible. The MacGuffin is so confusing, so contrived, so unbelievable that the audience never comprehends the importance of the journey or feels vested in the success of our heroes. Lost Ark? Got it. Holy Grail? Check. Crystal Skull that allows aliens to return to their ""space between space""? Huh? Lucas' love for CGI and Spielbergs decision to rely on it was a huge mistake. Everything in this film feels fake...the sets, the bad Russian wigs, the CGI explosions, the CGI chase scenes, the CGI sunsets. In Raiders (and even Temple and Crusade) everything felt REAL, and therefore we felt that Indy and his cohorts were in peril. In Crystal Skull, Indiana's charm is completely lost because no longer is he forging ahead in the face of insurmountable odds...no, now he's forging ahead in the face of CGI'd acrobatic monkeys. Spielbergs incredible gift to the world (back when he made good films) was his innate ability to make the fantastical believable. His organic approach to film-making made us BELIEVE that an alien befriended a child, that a 30 foot shark jumped up onto a boat, and that the Lost Ark could melt faces. Every second of Crystal Skull feels fake and therefore elicits no emotion, except anger over spending 12 bucks.The script has no structure, no charm, and no cohesiveness. After watching Indy 4 you can actually feel how important Lawrence Kasdan (writer for Raiders) and Jeffrey Boam (writer for Crusade) were to the series. Their ability to give Indy a quick-witted charm is sorely missed, not to mention their ability to make every set piece, every action sequence integral to the story and the building of character. In Indy 4, there's no link between scenes, stories, or character, and that's, in the words of Henry Jones, ""intolerable."" I won't bad mouth Shia LaBouf, because many have already. Yes his performance is soulless and charmless, but his part is thinly written and seems to feel like nothing more than an excuse to keep the series going. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is probably the most disappointing experience I've ever had at the movies. I've waited almost 20 years to see Indy again, and I feel like my loyalty to the franchise was exploited and my childhood memories were stolen. If you wish to avoid these feelings I suggest the following: close your eyes tight and don't look at it. Whatever you do, don't look at it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1105,Conservative_Critic,Wonderful End to an Awesome Series,8,1 June 2008,"From the stirring, opening scene in New Mexico, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" fits in very well with the Lucas/Spielberg Indiana Jones series, while still conveying a sense of change. The year is 1957. Almost twenty years ago, Dr. Henry Jones Jr., better known as Indiana, embarked on a quest to save the Holy Grail from the clutches of Nazi Germany. This time, however, Indy is facing off against nationalistic Soviets, hell-bent on procuring a legendary crystal skull, which is supposedly the key to an ancient city built by the Mayans, renowned as El Dorado. Harrison Ford delivers a commendable performance as Indiana Jones, this being his fifth reprising of the role (he made a cameo in an episode of ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" in the 1990s). Ford shows a much more encyclopedic and friendly Indy, instead of the sort of mercenary-type character from the first two films. Shia LaBeouf's performance was better than I expected--he plays his co-starring role so well that I wasn't constantly thinking of the guy from ""Transformers"" in an Indiana Jones film. Karen Allen is showing her age a bit, but she portrays Marion Ravenwood with the same spunk and adventurous attitude as she did in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). I will say that I felt very nostalgic, remembering the old Indy films in contrast to this brand-new one. The absence of Dr. Jones Sr., Marcus Brody and Sallah creates a noticeable void, though I am glad that the fast-paced film takes a moment to recall these old and beloved characters. On the con side, ""Crystal Skull"" was definitely more of a thrill-a-minute type film than the previous two movies, which seemed much more intellectual to me (with the exclusion of ""Temple of Doom,"" 1984). This is not to say that Lucas and Spielberg are losing their touch, but rather that they are adapting to a new generation of moviegoers' expectations. My last criticism is a much more subject one, but I will state it. Perhaps I'm an ""Indy traditionalist,"" but I wasn't entirely too comfortable with the featured creatures at first (I won't reveal their identities for the benefit of those who haven't seen the movie yet). I think that they contributed to the considerably weaker ending. However, in conclusion, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008) is a very enjoyable, fast-paced film. I highly recommend it to the Indy lovers and to all who love adventure films. MY INDIANA JONES MOVIE RANKINGS:1. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) 2. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) 3. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) 4. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1106,dvanosdol,The Greatest Hero Comes Back!,9,25 May 2008,"When I went to see this movie, I thought it might be a horrible movie full of stupid plots and mediocre CGI. This was mainly because of the numerous poor reviews I had seen about the film. Yet this movie is far better than I expected. In truth, I don't know why so many people don't like this movie. It had everything you expected in an Indiana Jones movie. Chase scenes, trekking through jungles, fighting evil villains from Europe, that hat and Indy himself, who looks, sounds, and acts like he should. The characters are all great, even Shia LaBeouf's character Mutt who I actually liked. The plot was pretty good, not as good as Raiders's plot, but still pretty good. The CGI doesn't ruin the story in any way, it looks realistic. Harrison Ford's age doesn't matter at all, he plays his part perfectly like always. Two things were wrong with the film. One was the very, very beginning, in which a car of teenagers is driving down the road with 50's music playing loudly. This could have been done a lot better, and it is something that truly didn't feel right with the film. The second problem was the part in which Indycomes across a town used for nuclear testing; after he escapes the soviets in the beginning. He goes inside a refrigerator to escape the blast of a nuclear bomb. When the bomb detonates, he miraculously survives not only the blast itself, but also from the refrigerator flying a mile in the air and then slamming into the ground. I don't even think Indy himself could have survived that. All in all, though,Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an exciting action/adventure flick that will keep you at the edge of your seat. This is definitely the second-best in the series, just after Raiders of the Lost Ark of course.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1107,soundman2000,Worst film of the year!,1,25 May 2008,Having seen the original 3 Indiana Jones films I was expecting some of the same magic that we all saw in the first 3 films. In fact in this new film by Spielberg you get quite the opposite. It has all the same aspects of the originals but in making this film they did the worst thing imaginable. Spielberg seems to have sold and is following the new trends like a sheep following the rest of the herd off of a cliff. Instead of taking his time with this one as with the last 3 he seems to have rushed this to the theaters prematurely. Even with all the new CGI and way out there story plot there is no redeeming quality to this film. This almost seems like a story that M. Night. Shamamaladingdong would come up with >_<. Sufficive to say after seeing this 2 hour long piece of crap littered with numerous errors and contradictions and scenarios that outlandish and unbelievable I came away with only a few things. 1. The worst waist of 2 hours of my life. I wonder if there is any way i can get them back..... 2. After all the wonderful films Spielberg has made in the past it would seem that maybe he is finished. He would have to pull some miracle out of nowhere to recover from this blunder. And finally like the rest of the die hard movie fans have repeatedly said time and again..... leave well enough alone.... Indiana Jones was a classic and I just hope Crystal skull wont ruin the other 3 for anyone else. I just wish i could give this a rank lower than 0 out of 10.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Both the boys enjoyed the film immensely, with my son rating it as his favourite of the 4. If you've not seen this film yet please ignore the nit-pickers, the film is excellent entertainment. All of the films could be pulled apart if that is what you set out to do, if you go along wanting to be entertained then you won't be disappointed. Personally I enjoyed KotCS more than ToD or Last Crusade. I found ToD nauseating in parts (monkey brains, eye soup etc.) and Last Crusade allowed the pace to slow too often. KotCS was fun from start to finish and certainly as good as, if not better than II and III in the series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1109,majorfilmlover,What were they thinking?!,2,16 June 2008,"It's hard not to be so harsh in this review because of several things: this was a great series up to this point, there was a long wait for this particular movie with issues over script, and we grew up loving Indian Jones.I actually had low expectations going into see this because I don't like seeing sequels after a near perfect last movie (Last Crusade), and I also heard some rumbling from my friends who saw this first but did not elaborate as to ruin the experience for me.That being said, I literally walked in with low expectations and that is exactly what was delivered to me. The whole premise of this adventure was based on aliens not from the future, but from a different dimension. These beings are made of crystal and are so powerful as to melt your brain with psychic kinetic thoughts, but only if the 13th scull is returned to the crystal body owner. Oh wait, does it sound like I have my movies confused and I'm thinking about something else? Yes? Sadly, no. This is actually the 4th Indie flick.The natives are useless because each time they even attempt to attack they are easily thwarted by, um, nothing, they just go away and leave them alone after just a little fighting back. Okay, one of them inhaled is own blow dart but since it was in reverse it should have been no hard no foul...NOT.Karen Allen, jeez. She's pointless in this one. She had such spunk and charisma in Raiders, but comes off as a mental patient in this latest, always smiling when most people would be screaming such as falling of cliffs multiple times.Speaking of mental, the Oz guy is the same person who played the billionaire in the Jody Foster movie Contact. I suppose they wanted to use a character easily identifiable with aliens because it worked in the past. It does not work here.Shia was okay, but poor guy had to pretend he was a monkey in one of the more ridiculous scenes in the movie. The most ridiculous? I would say is the convenient lead lined fridge and an atom bomb. Add in that equation a geriatric Indie and boom, no injuries that a quick water bath won't cure.This movie felt like all the spare parts and half-baked ideas that Lucas and Spielberg must have had over the years because it is disjointed, silly, and laugh out loud horrible.I'm going to pretend that none of this happened and this movie was never produced. Let's all pretend the Last Crusade was just that...the final movie. All is well and I can now sleep again at night.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1110,Fendertyterman,It has the same feel as all of the other Indy movies.,8,27 February 2009,"It makes me mad to see everybody bashing this film. ""He survived a nuclear blast in a fridge"", ""There were aliens in it"", etc. etc. Come on people, this movie has the same feel as all of the other films. Sure, it may not be as good as the first three, but it is still a great film. Many people bash it because of the ""aliens"" in it. They consider it strange and out of place in an Indy film. However, is it really that strange? If you think about it, Raiders of the Lost Ark had ghosts that emerged from a box and killed Nazis. Temple of Doom had a guy that ripped peoples hearts out while they were still beating, and the Last Crusade had a knight that was near 1000 years old, yet he was still living inside an ancient temple. Another part in which people complain about is the scene where Indy survives a nuclear blast by cramming himself inside of a fridge. So what? In the Temple of Doom he jumped out of a moving plane....in a life raft. Indiana Jones movies are supposed to have the crazy, unbelievable stuff in them that makes them fun. I think that another reason why people are complaining is because it has been almost 20 years since the Last Crusade came out, so a lot of people probably don't know what to expect. Many of them probably haven't even watched an Indy movie since the last one came out. People in today's society also don't have their own opinion, and they just go by what everybody else tells them. Sadly, it also goes for people's opinions of films as well. This movie starts out crazy, just like the other 3 before it, and stays totally ""Indy"" the whole way through. This is a great film, and I think that people should appreciate it a lot more. If you are a true Indiana Jones, or even just a true ""movie"" fan, you should enjoy this film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1111,smith666,Raiders from Space,6,15 October 2008,"O.k. so I also had a bit of a problem with the plot of this latest Indiana Jones movie. It has the look, feel, and excitement of the previous film's. But, aliens? Don't get me wrong, I like alien's but i'm not sure they belong in an Indiana Jones movie. I'm not sure what they were thinking when they came up with that idea. However it is still a pretty good movie. Harrison Ford still kicks butt, and I was happy to see Karen Allen brought back in. I have also become a fan of Shia LaBeouf thanks to Transformers, even if I can't pronounce his name. And I have yet to see Cate Blanchett give a bad performance. Really is it such a stretch from a golden box with ghost's coming out of it, to aliens that helped build pyramids. So the plot could have used a little tweaking, but overall, not a bad movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1112,lorilopez13,Indy 4-Ever!!! He has always been larger than life . . .,10,12 March 2009,"I have to speak out when there are too many naysayers lined up to trash a legendary figure, as well as a quality project. A longtime fan of Indiana Jones, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas, I take offense at the nasty attitude permeating this collection of comments. In my earnest opinion, it was a pleasure to sit back and watch a fourth Indy film! What an incredible gift to the fans! My sons and I have not been able to attend movies in a theater for over a decade, but we had to see Indy on the big screen. It was great, a memorable experience. We own few D.V.D.s as a low-income family, but we bought this one along with the first three. As far as we're concerned, it's Indy 4-Ever! He has always been larger than life . . .Had Lucas and Spielberg changed the formula, tried to make everything more credible and believable than in the initial films, there would have been an even bigger wave of protests. This happened with the Star Wars prequels, which are excellent films in their own right. And sufficiently traditional, yet cutting-edge like the originals for their time. Where does all of this hate stem from? When I see filmmakers put so much love into a cherished project, I appreciate the effort. I refrain from nitpicking and try to enjoy the work as intended, because it's a film or a show, a form of entertainment and art. I look for the positive points. I guess some people feel more important criticizing others, especially legends. I've seen bad films, bad television too. I know the difference, yet a lot of people watch any kind of garbage while quality is often trashed. Filth and gore and grossness have become far more popular than anything actually good.

1113,evk310,technical problems are disturbing your time to enjoy while watching,7,11 March 2009,"i found out that thousands of people reviewed it as one of the worst movies ever ...i thought it was still entertaining , although i agree the movie was not well made .. it has too many mistakes to keep your mind focused and to enjoy. the cuts from one to the other scene are often too sudden and strange . also i didn't hear anyone complain about the sound, i am probably the only one that can hear something is wrong with the studio work voice over job. you can hear clearly that every spoken phrase has been dubbed in a studio . i don' t mind that , as long as the movie sounds like you are on location , but it really sounds like a recording studio . cheap and fast production it seems to me. nobody probably did care about it , and wanted to finish the movie soon to cash the money . that is what i think. where was the director deciding if the job was well done ? maybe he was just tired , and didn't double check the final sound results, that also counts for the strange cuts here and there . i guess everyone can see that a lot of cuts from one to the next scene are not so well worked out ... it makes me think all the time ... what was that going on there ? instead of following the movie. i would think this movie was made by a few kids doing this for the first time inspired by classics . not good enough for a world hit as they promise you in the hype and trailers ...i still give a 7 , sometimes the movie is OK here and there just a few parts ..",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1114,olianajones,It's not terrible...come on.....,7,13 December 2010,"So Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Indiana Jones is now 60 and living in the 1950s, during the days of the Soviet gripped America and is setting out on his latest adventure to find the mystical crystal skull. Along with him for the adventure are Mutt Williams, original flame Marion Ravenwood and 'Ben Gunn' style character, Harold Oxley. Their journey takes them across America to Area 51 all the way to South America to the Mayan Pyramids where they uncover the mystery of UFOs.First off, the incredibly negative label this film is tagged with is completely unnecessary. I can understand why the prequels of Star Wars are hated, because they genuinely are not done well enough, but come on, what where people expecting from a fourth Indiana Jones? Were they expecting it to be better than Raiders? Blockbusters of the old are long gone, however IMO this film remains true to the vein of serials and more importantly, Indiana Jones.Harrison Ford IMO blazes in this during the first hour and fits perfectly back into the fedora and khaki gear of Indiana Jones. Other actors deserving recognition are Shia Labeouf as Mutt, Indy's tenacious son and I always thought Ray Winstone was very entertaining as Mac, the double crossing spy who Indy constantly bangs heads with during the course of the film.I never said the film was awful, but it sure isn't perfect either. One of the biggest problems with Crystal Skull are too many characters and too little time to develop them all. After the infamous 'waterfall' scene, the film goes over that figurative waterfall too for a while as it becomes all about plot pieces and not about characters, as Indy drags his clique around from place to place when really it should have just been him and Mutt to establish and continue the father/son theme Indiana Jones is known for from Last Crusade.Another problem I think was lack of plot. The film starts off great IMO and the first hour is superb entertainment for a 2008 action film, showing films like 'The Mummy' and 'National Treasure' how it is done. But once the villains show up and the race begins to find the McGuffin, everything becomes contradictive and rushed. If the Soviets are the bad guys, why the hell is Indy practically spelling out for them how to find the Crystal Skull? Stupid old man.However, not everything in my review is negative. After all, I'm one of the Indy 4 lovers. The action is great in this, especially the first half an hour in the Nevada desert, which captures the true essence of action films from the 50s. Conspiracy theories, espionage and aliens. IMO it fits wonderfully into the Indiana Jones universe. A triumphant score from John Williams is always welcomed and the majority of practical set pieces and stunts rather than tacky, dominant CGI is a welcome as well.In summary, as I said earlier in the review, what were people expecting? Raiders? Temple of Doom? If the three original films ever got together and had a child, it would probably look a lot like Crystal Skull. Granted, someone on the production team may have had a little too much freedom to do what they pleased, but overall this film is a fine effort and goes well with the trilogy.7 out of 10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1115,tcutbirth,People booed at the end,6,22 May 2008,"20 years for this? At least ""Last Crusade"" served crackers with its cheese. I felt like I was having that ""Alien Gospel"" propaganda shoved down my throat, and they could barely patch together a movie around the pre-determined plot stops (yes, stops, as this story runs in episodic fits and flows like bricks through a straw - ugh). I wish I hadn't stayed up late for the premiere, or had seen ""Caspian"" again instead - at least that movie had some dramatic tension, and didn't pin its action scenes to an actor who was already too old for this crap ten years ago. Awful. I won't even get into how obvious and sloppy most of the compositing work is, especially every time Shia is in a closeup on the motorcycle (nice Harley commercial, BTW). For such a big budget movie so long in the making, it felt *cheap* (Lucas is addicted to virtual sets now, whether they actually look good or not).I used to be a huge Indiana Jones fanboy - when I was little I had my bull whip with me all the time and had all the Indy comic books. I still enjoy the original three stories (the first is obviously the best of the series, just as ""Empire"" was easily the best Star Wars film). Seriously, though, George Lucas lost it a long time ago, and this movie is a testament to the continual slide of his once-masterful cinematic chops. It felt like watching a 58 year old ex-champion boxer getting beaten by a 25 year old monster - he should have hung up his gloves a long time ago.Stilted dialogue, choppy editing, boring cinematography, flat made-for-digital-cameras lighting (yes, I know it was film, but it wasn't used properly), a leading lady who is too excited to be in movies again to wipe the damn grin off of her face long enough to actually do some acting, and no good quiet moments to pace the build up of plot tension in order to get the audience really engaged.This could have been something - but somewhere in the perpetual rewrites (even Spielberg couldn't understand why Lucas rejected Frank Darabont's last script), this movie lost the Indiana Jones magic. I'm sure Lucas will claim he was just trying to end the franchise on a fun (yet pseudo-profound) note, but he seems more like the old uncle who crashed your birthday party who won't stop telling knock-knock jokes or asking your teenage friends to pull his finger again and again, laughing at his own ""cleverness"". Sad. Let the ignorant and banal (most of public-schooled America, basically) slavishly pour undeserved praise on this film, but let the discerning chose to pass on this one, or wait until it comes to the discount theater. Not a must-see, and definitely not worth a DVD purchase, let alone a second viewing. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1116,SGuy157,"Not great, but not awful either",7,5 January 2011,"Before seeing this film, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as any of the other Indiana Jones movies. It turns out that I was right. Although it was great to see Dr. Jones back in action once again, the storyline wasn't really all that great.Indiana Jones has always been able to perform stunts that could not be survived by anyone in real life in all four movies, but to many viewers what he does seems logical and possible. However, when he survived unharmed from the explosion during the bomb test just taking shelter a fridge made out of steel, I found that to be a too unbelievable. After being thrown in the air while still in the fridge, he was able to just walk out of it without a scratch as if nothing even happened.Overall, I'm not saying that this is a horrible movie that should never be watched, but just don't expect to get much when watching this movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

People complain it was too action packed or that the action was too over the top, but there is plenty of good dialogue/puzzle solving and the action is well implemented.

I really like this movie and I really hate it.Like: They somehow got the majority of the original cast, which is amazing in my eyes. They also kept true to a lot of traits that Indy had that made up his personality.Dislike: The plot is a bit ridiculous. Granted, Indy always goes up against the unusual, but I never did think of aliens as something that would qualify.

1119,piece_of_heavn,Better Than You Think It Is,8,27 May 2008,"I saw this movie today; afterwards I came to read some of the message boards. All I can say is wow, this movie's been shredded, and it really doesn't deserve it. The movie was set to happen in the same future time frame as the amount of years Harrison Ford had actually aged. It helped make the plot that much better, as 'Indiana' had also aged. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen still have that on-screen romantic spark going on. They work great together. Cate Blanchett was a real surprise for me, mostly because I didn't recognize her right off. She does evil well. Shia LaBeouf does alright in the fight scenes (considering he's supposed to be a punk kid who doesn't fight). The CGI had mesh issues, but it still worked really well. I loved the plot, even though it didn't really connect with the current theories about the crystal skulls. My only concern about this movie, is now that LeBeouf has been named the 'heir apparent,' does that mean Ford will no longer be reprising his role of 'Dr. Jones'?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1120,Martwell,Lives Up To The Hype!,7,24 May 2008,"I saw the fourth Indy movie with a bunch of twelve year old boys celebrating a birthday. They ALL loved it and now that I have time to think about it, so did I....well nearly. There has been a lot of criticism about the 50's plot and the references to the first three movies. I think that a lot of people forget that the Indy films are not, and have never been, particularly high brow entertainment and this movie's plot line and all the aforementioned references were entirely appropriate and appreciated by the audience. The first three movies were based on the old Saturday afternoon movie serials and this installment follows the same formula. (It actually was a good idea to see it on a Saturday afternoon!)Lots of action, a few laughs and characters you have become familiar with. This movie scores an all three points and if that is not good enough for you then maybe you were expecting too much! Why did I NEARLY love it....the ending was fairly ordinary, reminded me of too many Stephen King novels when he runs out of ideas in the last quarter of a book. Having said that though, it was still a very worthwhile couple of hours entertainment. The highlight?

Well before I get into trouble and people start tuning in to Al Jazeera, he hasn't - but he may as well have been, because I can't see how Steven Spielberg could have made Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. George Lucas maybe, but Spielberg? Do me a favour.This film is downright awful. Not just in the context of colossal expectation for the continuation of a damn-near perfect franchise. It's stand-alone awful. The most awful thing about this awful film is the script - you know, the thing that screenwriter after screenwriter kept having a crack at, the beards kept kicking back - and to think that this God-awful Close Encounters psycho-babble BS was the version that drew the most consensus just blows my mind. I would have loved to have seen the Frank Darabont effort that by all accounts Steven Spielberg and Ford loved - but George flipping Lucas didn't like - make the screen. George Lucas, that man needs pensioning off quick.Ford is still Indiana Jones - thank goodness for small mercies, and the opening 20 minutes are solid, but that's as good as it gets. there's zero chemistry between Ford and Karen Allen, Ray Winstone's character changes sides enough times to make your head spin. The stunts and set-pieces are just preposterous, the convulted plot is incredibly difficult to follow, and even more difficult to care about. It just a real mess, and such a colossal disappointment.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It is like the movie itself has aged. What can we say when the main action scene is about Shia Labeof jumping with Monkeys from one tree to another? Compare it with the ""the Last crusade"" with Indy barely hanging from a German tank while fighting a whole German army. And just one scene with the ""whip""? That's heresy! As if the lame actions weren't enough, the acting was horrible (perhaps with exception of Shia Labeof who did just OK). Could someone please wipe that silly smile off Marian's face?

I suspect that any disappointment is due more to the expectation of hoping to feel the way we all felt when we saw our first Indy film (for me, Raiders on opening night). But who can ever bring that back? I thought the attempts to fill in the last 20 years were also interesting and the hints at Jones's activities during WWII were interesting. Furthermore, I liked Shia LaBoeuf as Henry Junior.

1124,dlevin9416,"Fine Sci-Fi, Bad Indy",4,25 May 2008,"Indy 4 was an OK sci-fi movie, but an awful Indiana Jones movie. First, Cate Blanchett was awful, dropping her accent like 4 times in the first few minutes of the movie. They couldn't find a real Russian accent? Also, what an unceremonious entry for one of the best action characters of all time: dragged out of the back of a car trunk. Insulting.Then, he survives a nuclear explosion by jumping inside a fridge and stopped being Indiana Jones, archaeologist, and started being Indiana Jones, radioactive superhero with cosmic powers. Lead lined doors stop radiation, not the 100000000 degree heat from melting the fridge into a single chunk of metal, with him inside. That was just preposterously insulting.The ending was just wrong - aliens leave the planet. But why? How did the alien lose it's skull in the first place? Weren't they dead? Suddenly it comes back to life? There's no explanation or logic to the ending. And what's with the Mayan people hiding in the temples? What, they just hang out there all day in case someone comes by?

1126,ogasior,Indiana Jones: shallow but interesting,9,15 May 2014,"A lot of lovely touches in this film. Some great scenes, action work/ choreography, and in a lot of ways the over-the-top action felt aright for this film.. although it didn't feel like a Classic Indy film by any means. There were some moments in the film where the action was absurd; however, in other moments it felt perfect. I'd love more development in the character of his wife, where I felt she truly only had her moment in the sun as for heroism (aside from driving through the jungle) during the waterfall scene, which was only topped in stupidity by shia swinging on vines with monkey's; but she was great in the quick-sand and in the car with Indy, as well as her mom tips to Shia during his sword-fight. Those moments defined her like the bar-scene defined Shia's character, the college romping (btw nice anti-soviet humor), and the robbing of the tomb scene. Indy was great in the entrance scene, and simply generally. Now the problem with the character depth in this film is why I call it shallow. The past Indy films made you deeply in touch with the characters, which made the humor interesting and fun, and the action always was over-the-top but realistic or in some dimension, reasonably- realistic. The characters had the chance to truly express themselves and felt human. The characters in this film felt like movie characters, not people. Cate Blanchett did great as the villain, and I loved her in that role, because it suited her.. and she was a sexy bad girl ! An ex. of some character development would have been some envy and jealousy of soccer mom wife against Cate and some mild flirtation between Dr. Jones and evil Cate while both characters are hopelessly tied up, and left to some form of imprisonment, left open to escape, via guards/ key's, Indy advising his wife of some task.. etc. I think the characters were well cast, the story was really deep with the alien stuff going on.. it was rather disturbing and unsettling actually. I thought 'signs' was scary in high school, and rather mild as an adult.. but this film made me feel uncomfortable as an adult. The character OZ albeit criticism I felt was well done.. but in reality he just looked like a hippy strung out on acid... still well-done. As hard of a pill as it would be to swallow this movie really needed an extra 45 minutes of character development. I suppose it had the right amount of action.. and perhaps the producers felt this movie couldn't be a sit through for the modern audience and took out all development scenes (and made a mistake). The movie showed tons of potential, and Harrison looked fine. I think ultimately the aim of the film was off.. they simply wanted to continue where they left off.. maybe it needed some reinvention, and that's why it became so goofy. Still a good film.. 8/10 stars. Made me actually think (which is weird), and I felt the Spielberg/ Ford magic, and liked all the characters involved. Far from a disappointment, and would watch another Indiana Jones effort (even in 2017) Thanks to Harrison for being one of the greats and Spielberg/ Lucas as well.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It doesn't matter though, because even someone who hasn't experienced the older movies would still be disappointed by this poorly done movie.Can't Hollywood make well-done movies anymore? The only decent ones that seem to come out anymore are the independents or the little-knowns. This movie is so over-the-top unrealistic it trumps all of the previous Jones' movies fake scenes put together. The waterfall scene is absurd; I almost left the theater, but thank goodness it got worse after that! It is like watching a cartoon during the last 1/3 or 1/4 of the movie, and I've seen better cartoons even!Hardly anything in this movie is real, but the 'filming' is in such good quality that it becomes blatantly obvious; the foam rocks and stones, the ridiculously fake treasure, and the absurdly unrealistic lighting, especially at the end. The CGI is well done yet somehow it still sucks horribly, probably because of it's gross negligence of the laws of physics. It's pretty clear that the CGI 'artists' grew up playing video games where stuff like this is possible.People please stop paying full price to see movies like this and if you didn't like it in the theater don't buy it 'just because'. The more we buy into this stuff the more crappy movies they're going to make and the richer they're going to get while we walk away disappointed and feeling used.Hollywood, please stop expecting CGI and action to save a movie; we need good acting!

As a old starwars fan I knew the destruction George Lucas can do (he made me a fan of starwars and took my love for it away as well) to his old franchises.Luckily Indy 4 isn't as bad as SW 1-3, it actually felt like an indiana jones movie. With SW 1-3 it just didn't have the appropriate vibe. It was just a bunch of uninteresting characters spread across a CGI universe instead of an interesting group traveling together (SW4-6). Indy 4 doesn't make this mistake and it's another oldschool adventure with Henry Jones and a side kick.None of the new characters were really as bad as they seemed or were made out to be by the reviews I had read. Blanchett makes Spalko interesting enough as the villain and Shia isn't bad as the side kick either. Plus the CGI effects were really put to good use, I had seen clips and it looked bad but apart from one or two scenes it didn't feel like CGI at all.It's not all good unfortunately. The ending is a bit over the top, it could have been just as good if not better if there was more mystery left. But that's about the only thing where this movie is different then the previous installment.Of course being worthy of being an indy movie doesn't immediately make it a good movie.

1131,jpccttn,Some brilliancy of the old indy shadowed by a weak screenplay,7,26 May 2008,"It seems that Spielberg and Lucas are past their prime. This film is very well directed, has great scenography but lacks good ideas. I think the first half of the film is pretty good, with the right mix of action and pauses, and with characters well behaving in their roles. Mutt is a fine figure, trying to look like a tough guy in situations he can't handle. He and Indy (well acted by Ford) are good together thought not as good as indy and his father. The second half of the film is a messy number of action scenes, unoriginal, silly, too much unbelievable, not very ironic (like its predecessors) but just silly and predictable. Mutt in the jungle like Tarzan, the jeep falling in a tree and then coming back to the russians, giant red ants are just some of the unnecessary action scenes in this part of the film. The sword duel ? Silly. In a jeep chase (which is too long) you have so many other things to worry than just fighting in a jeep ring with a sword. Then it comes the final which suffers a weak plot: aliens ... an alien who comes to life from 13 crystall skulls, an UFO ... all gets destroyed ... very unoriginal and boring, since they look like scenes you've already seen in many other movies. The alien plot is weak, giving a sci-fi touch to the indiana jones franchise. It suited much better the mystical and mysterious elements in the first three films ... Actors are OK, the best are Ford and LaBeouf. Karen Allen and Winstone's characters are secondary and seem unuseful except same comic shots. Blanchett's character is fine but not memorable. I wont't spend many words on CGI except that is part of modern cinema and it is obvious it is used when needed. I don't understand why many complaints about it. It was fine and such final scenes could only be done with CGI. It is much more complex film that ""temple of doom"" but not as funny and ironic in my opinion. Nonetheless is much more less consistent than ""raiders"" and ""the last crusade"". The film is enjoyable and better than many other modern action movies. In the final notes I can say that this film has some brilliancy of the old ones but the overall plot and ideas are weak and unoriginal. Perhaps Spielberg and Lucas should think about that.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I also thought the running fight between two jeeps through the jungle and on the edge of a high mountainside was worth watching.Yes, the film takes you to realms way, way beyond belief, but it does draw on one or two well documented theories about what might have happened years ago in South America.By the time you read this review, you will probably have seen the film anyway.My message is - ""Just go and enjoy the ride"" The cinema was packed all day where I viewed the film, and it has of course already done good business.One thing I would say is that the usual end of film ""What happened to the villain"" scene was not as good as in previous films, despite the modern technology.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I thought by the trailers for this film, that the same would be true... Not so. This movie, although not HORRIBLE, is yet another huge let down. You can tell by the story of the film that so many ideas were stolen from various scripts are poorly pasted togeather by David Kepp. I loved Harrison and he is the only reason this movie got a 7. The characters in this movie, haven given time to grow, could have been sooo much better. The villain in this film never really felt like much of a threat to Jones. Just a pain in his ass, nothing more/less. I love how the updated to the 50's so the natural things going on are fresh and help with Harrisons age, but I felt like that opened the door for all this sci-fi crap that is used far to much in the film. There are so many moments in the film (even for an Indy movie) that make u just roll your eyes and shake your head wondering what in God's name they were thinking (the fridge/shia and the monkeys/the whole ending). All in all, I think it was just OK, nothing more/less. It was good to see Indy back, but I think too much special FX, coupled with a mesh mash script and a weak villain and really unused characters make it a letdown. I pray a 5th one comes out and gets things back on track so the series doesen't end with this one. And I pray George Lucas doesn't make that one a letdown and or make it take 20 years for it to be made.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1136,ashraf_zaky11,Indy4 with Spielberg and Ford,10,16 June 2008,"I like to say that the whole Indiana Jones series without Spielberg and Ford will never be the same, there is a spirit in those movies that the director and the main actor gives to the movie this spirit will not be there if Shia LAPouf replaces Harrison Ford in Indy5 (if there is Indy5), I am sorry to say that there is NO one who can give that Charmaine's and attraction to the character of Indiana Jones but Harrison Ford, its a chemistry, or like they say in ""Shekespere in Love"" ....""its a Mystrey"", personally, I wish to see the same couple, Spielberg and Ford in Indy5 without the new kid, the only comment on Indy4 that there is some scenes which is longer than it deserves/expected, if we make a simple comparison between Indy4 and Indy2 you will find that the old one has very short scenes in a lot of different locations and each of them has a different kind of adventure, from the casino to the car to the air to the mountain to the water to the palace to the tunnel to the Cliff.... but in Indy4 you have long adventure in one location, so you sometimes loose that feeling of Indy2 when your hands is holding the chair arm and you are holding your breath to know what will happen",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1137,wwm_mem,It was great!,8,25 May 2008,"OK, the premise was a little hokey but it was a semi-plausible story line. There was adventure, mystery, romance, intrigue, everything else the other Indiana Jones movies had. There wasn't quite as much humor as the previous three movies but it didn't bother me. I was never a big fan of ""The Temple of Doom"" and I think ""Crystal Skull"" is a lot better. I was glad to see Marion return. I would have liked to have seen Sean Connery and John Rhys-Davies return as well but it was still great without them. True Indiana Jones fans will love this because it sticks with the genre and is as exciting as ""Raiders"" and ""Last Crusade"". All in all, a great continuation of the Indiana Jones saga with a wide-open door for more movies with Harrison Ford or with Shia LaBeouf. I will definitely see it again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1138,kornaaron,Well thats 2 hours of my life I can't get back!!!,2,22 May 2008,"Let me start by saying I am a massive Indiana Jones fan and love the original trilogy and the young Indiana Jones TV Series. I never wanted them to make number 4 and at first I didn't even want to see it but I got in the spirit and got quite hyped up about it. My friends all reassured me that it was going to be the best Indy film yet and that it would be a good adventure film.When we got to the midnight screening I was actually quite looking forward to it and got ready in my seat in the front row. Once the film started, everything went downhill, very quickly. Even the opening was without humour or enjoyment, how are you meant to grab peopels attention when the beginning is so poor.the locations looked like the cgi ones from 'Sky Captain World of Tomorrow' and the music seemed to be taken directly from 'Star Wars episode 1'. I was tempted on walking out about 20 minutes in but decided it couldn't get any worse and I hoped the story would pick up. I thought to myself, 'how could it get any worse'. Boy! was I wrong to do so, I wish that I had walked out, as the film made me more and more angry as it went on. I mean with such a great cast you would have thought they would be used effectively, but no. the script is laughably bad and the action scenes are too cgi based. The Cgi looks worse than that of some Sci-Fi channel movies and stands out really badly. I was surprised to find out afterwards that most of the film is not actually cgi but it comes down to the use of soft light that has been used throughout. the action set pieces start out like your usual Indy action but they soon collapse in a non humorous way into explosions and immature sight gags which just seem to be there to keep the young teens happy. the whole film actually feels far more childish than the young indiana jones TV series that was aimed at teenagers.When the film was finished I was so upset, Lucas and Spielberg had actually destroyed Indy for me and I'm annoyed because of it. that is now two great childhood memories that George Lucas has destroyed for me . all he has to do now is make a sequel to THX1138 and he has truly succeeded in destroying the lineage that he has produced. With a Fifth film in talks I just hope that Spielberg retires before it can be made or relises what he has done, but then again they can't make a film much worse than they already have!!! (The only reason I have given it 2 stars is because of the cast,especially John Hurt. although they are wasted they did an OK job with what was presented to them in the poor script.)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This episode appears to be setting up the 'new' son for his own movies or maybe even a television series. After this installment I won't be looking for it in either place. The story almost hooked me until the jumping around started with the storyline, most notably the KGB agents who looked and acted more like recycled Nazi's from earlier episodes, the flying monkeys (the trees where a bit of a distance from the cars)and the flying saucer. When the ship appeared I got up and left the theater feeling like Harrison Ford should have taken the high road and passed on this one, but I'm sure it was a good payday and you can't fault him for that. I'm sorry, I know many will disagree with my opinion of this film but it left me feeling empty where the others made me feel satisfied and wanting more. So much potential! PS.

I don't know...I saw the 12:01am screening...it could be that I am a bit tired. But, when I wake up in the morning, I hope the real Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is playing; the one with the humor, the action, the close calls, the whipping, the sense of urgency and discovery. I don't know what movie I just saw, but Harrison Ford was in it wearing a hat. If you love Kevin Costner's accent in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, you'll love Cate Blanchet's accent. Oh! They sure went to a lot of places, and I kept looking really hard, but never saw the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Can there be little, blink-and-you-miss-it kingdoms?

1142,eugsantosvela,"Third best, please Steve and George make another one, don't listen to the haters",8,21 February 2009,"Before watching this film, I never took any Indy film seriously due to the series' episodic nature (Indy changing love interests, the vanishing of Short Round and Willie Scott, etc) IU watched the film I enjoyed it and now I have it at home with the original three. I think this is the third best Indy film behind Raiders and Crusade. It is better than Temple of Doom. I was a bit skeptical of Harrison Ford returning due to the fact that he's in his sixties, but he's still very agile and energetic. I liked seeing Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood return and seeing her and Indy getting married. I liked the Shia Labeouf character very much and I hope to see him in a sequel. I didn't mind about the alien stuff, this doesn't feel like a sci-fi film and does feel like an Indy movie.I get angry every time I read a negative comment about George Lucas. If you don't like the Star Wars prequels (which I don't get) or Indy 4, fine but don't insult him that way. It's like reading about Batman and Robin, which is a comedy disguised as a superhero movie. This film is not bad nor good, it's GREAT, ADVENTUROUS and THRILLING. I think it just got overshadowed by the successes of The Dark Knight and Iron Man.About the fridge scene, I know that it's a little strange but unrealistic but it's not that big a deal. I'd crawl into a fridge if I'd have to do it to escape from some kind of danger.I think that it's impassible to have unanimously positive reviews of a sequel or a prequel of a film series after a long-time hiatus because you feel like you start fresh and that's kinda hard.Star Wars 2 and 3 are proof that George can learn from some mistakes and do a better sequel.

1143,devil_may_cry_318,"Not a travesty, but still a disappointment",5,26 May 2008,"OK, I'll say this now, I'm not that big of an Indy fan, but from what I've watched of the last three films, I enjoyed. To be honest, I was neither totally devastated, nor extremely pleased with what I had just watched.Having said that, the bad outweighs the good in this film. The CGI was way too overused for my liking, and some scenes (particularly the jungle chase sequence,) just looked tacky. The stunts, while being fairly humorous, were just so over-the-top that you just couldn't take them seriously (need I mention a certain fridge scene at all.) My main gripe however, is the actual story. Seriously, was that the best that they could have come up with? Aliens!? Come on Spielberg, I know you like your aliens, but this was just way too much! Not only that, but there was so many unnecessary elements thrown into the story that it really could have done without them (like for example the tribesmen towards the end. Why were they there, there was no need for them!) Now then, the acting was actually alright, not great, just alright. Kate Blanchett didn't really feel that intimidating as a villain, but at least Harrison Ford fitted the bill as Indy once again. The little pieces of nostalgia thrown in to the story at certain points was a nice touch too.Overall, this was a bit of a disappointing movie. If Spielberg and Lucas had just stuck to what made previous Indy films so enjoyable, instead of going into an 'otherworldy' and ridiculous story, I probably would be saying different. I would say wait until the DVD comes out if you really want to watch this.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1145,Neon-man,A fun film that you have to enjoy!,8,3 July 2008,"The reason I'm writing this review is because I've seen a lot of hate for this film, which is unfortunate because it doesn't deserve it. I might not say I'm a fan of the Indy series, though I do love all three (four) movies. Indy 4 did not disappoint me. It's like the first three; it's fun, entertaining, a bit unrealistic (actually, really unrealistic, I'll get to that later) and a whole lot of fun for everyone, so it amazes me that people didn't see this. The movie isn't too stupid, it's well put together, the script is decent and the action makes the original trilogy proud. The jungle sequence is definitely something great, even if seeing Mutt Williams swing along vines with monkeys isn't your idea of entertainment.One thing that amazes me is that people hated the idea of aliens being involved in this movie. I didn't mind it; it seems to fit suitably with the supernatural elements of the Indy series, and we all know how big a fan Spielberg is of aliens. Well, perhaps it's an acquired taste. One other thing I loved about this film was Shia LaBeouf. His performance was nearly at a professional level and if they really make a Mutt Williams film (with Shia), I won't complain.There is stuff to nit-pick about in the film. There is quite a bit of useless CGI, the action is sometimes unconvincing, there aren't as many wise-cracks, etc, etc. But as a whole, the movie is great and it's definitely something to go check out. Remember, it's a B movie, so don't think too much with this film and try to spot all the mistakes. Just enjoy the film because it's one of the most entertaining to come out this year.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1146,sille1337,"Crap, a disgrace.",2,5 April 2021,"Feels like a unintended parrody. Acting is weak across the board, script and story is horribel, a 10 year old kid could have done better.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1147,emily-olivia-robson,"Fun to see Dr. Jones again, but he's been let down with this film.",5,19 April 2020,"It had all the promise of a good film. A perfect cast; you can't argue with Cate Blanchett, John Hurt, Ray Winstone to name a few. A perfect crew, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas together with the original producers etc. Yet 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' feels nothing like the Indiana Jones trilogy that came before it.The first three opening shots of the trilogy are of course, infamous dissolve of the Paramount mountain logo into a mountain shape with in the frame. Crystal Skull opens with an earth-mound and a CGI groundhog popping out. It immediately feels gimmicky, and I hate to say but rather sets the tone for the rest of the film.The entire film over uses CGI and it feels rather like a comment from the creators to say 'Hey, Indie is now SO old we can use CGI!'. You feel as though in the past movies they would have done something clever with editing or a good location scout to find alternative to CGI use but alas, in this movie is all we are gifted.
It's rather telling on the year in which it was made, of course CGI use in movies was really coming into it's own, but it feels bizarre in an Indiana Jones film. A tale about archaeology, facts and religion and now we've got... random CGI groundhogs as a comic gimmick? And CGI bugs and CGI explosions and the list goes on.Aside from the obvious 'Woo lets make this CGI because we can!' feeling. There are a few good plot points to mention.
Firstly, the scene where Mutt (Shia Lebouf) and Indiana are in a motorcycle chase against the antagonists is a lot of fun. This takes place around the college Dr. Jones professors at. We see this college through the trilogy and it's a good twist to take the action to the place Indiana works. The quip Dr. Jones makes to one of his students in the library feels like we're back watching the old Indie. 'If you want to study archaeology kid, you've got to get out of the library!', and he rides of on the back of a motorbike.
The twist about Mutt being Indiana's son is also interesting. It leads to some funny quips between Indie and Marion about why she let him quit his schooling. It's funny and feels like a realistic response from Indie to finding out he has a child. Well of course the professors son has no interest in school!However, Mutt is unfortunately a rather dislikable character. He has little redeeming features about him, and feels like he's been added purely for the big action sequences that 66 year-old Harrison can't really do anymore. Mutt has no character arch, he's very two-dimensional and we don't feel proud that he's Indies son? In fact Short Round in Temple of Doom feels more like Indiana's son.
Mutt makes no sacrifices, he's a good example of just one character in this film who was done a misjustice by being poorly written.Marion Ravenwood, 'Mac' played by Ray Winstone and John Hurts 'Oxley' are also examples of characters who unfortunately don't serve a huge amount to the plot. Oxley perhaps serves more than Ravenwood who feels like she's been bought back purely to be the 'love interest' and to tell Indie that he has a son, as if she wasn't a character in her own rights.
You feel let down and as if frankly they wrote too many characters into the script and then didn't know what to do with them.The scene where Mutt, or as we know understand, Henry Jones Jr III, is swinging through the trees on large vines, with the monkeys, feels so ludicrous it's almost laughable. A 50s greaser turned Tarzan? He'd never have the strength to do that, he's a kid who fixes up bikes. You just can\t suspend your disbelief enough to go along with it.
You could argue that all three of the other movies have ludicrous stunts where you feel as thought there would be no way Indie would survive that.
But it's part of the fun of the movies. Of course a normal person would never survive a fall from an aircraft with just an inflatable life boat, but Indiana would because he's that kind of character. Making it up as he goes along and surviving on literally pure luck 90% of the time. It's part of what makes him so likeable. However, introducing another character, whether it's his son or not, into that 'surviving on pure luck' idea just doesn't work.At the end of The Last Crusade we find out from Indies dad that Indiana's birth name is in-fact Henry Jones Jr. During Crystal Skull we barely actually hear the name Indiana Jones being mentioned at all. His famous name is barely uttered. It's milked to death that his name is now Henry Jones Jr. It feels disconnected and a bit weird to be hearing this quite so often as the film repeats. After all we like hearing people yell 'Indie!' whenever he's needed.It feels an awfully 'busy' film. Too many characters without archs or ways of developing the plot. Mac is a totally unnecessary character it feels like. Yes he lures the villains to the Crystal Skull beings but there's no recompense or moral lesson.
The whole KGB antagonists feel a little weird too. Cate Blanchett's KGB character wants to use the telepathic power of the skull to defeat governments, obviously a big no-no. She ends up seeking knowledge of everything and being the knower of all, and in the end gets what she wants, only it kills her as her mind cant take it. Which yes, feels similar to characters like those in Last Crusade but ultimately who are they defeating? The antagonists of the other three movies were far more deserving enemies. The Nazis were an excellent choice, easy to kill without mercy and who's book burning was everything Indiana was against. The Thuggee cult literally ripped out peoples hearts and used children as slaves so we all agree they were evil. But this KGB group? They didn't kill anyone? The kept Oxley alive, they kept Marion alive, they even kept Mac alive. Although they were enemies of the U.S at the time the film is set it's unclear how actually, to Indie, they're a necessary antagonist.There's not enough words in the english language to explain how out of place, out of this world, literally, the 'Aliens' are in this movie. Oh no sorry, 'beings of another dimension' (as if that isn't just making Indiana an alien movie).
The supernatural and paranormal do occur in Indiana Jones films. With large religious significance and occult representation but what reason... what possible reason was there to make a giant spacecraft. Not even a craft just a massive, stereotypical flying saucer at the end of this movie. It leads you to completely undo any suspension of disbelief and that is the biggest mistake you can make in movie making. You want the audience to be immersed in the story, not sitting back in their chair and thinking:
""What on earth am I watching?"".I'm sorry Indiana Jones, you've robbed many graves but now you've been the one robbed, of a good film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1148,myo39,Indy 4,7,9 June 2008,"I was unfortunate enough never to see an Indiana Jones movie before this one, and all I can say coming out of Indy 4 is that I do not want to see the other ones. The movie was good I thought but nothing spectacular. The whole way I was continuously reminded of National Treasure (which sucked itself and copied from the original Indys) and the nonstop action was ridiculous. The action was poorly put together and I think thats what the movie relied on. Unfortunately, anybody can throw together a movie filled with nonstop action, but does that make it good???? No it does not.Another thing that bothered me in Indy 4 was that there was very unrealistic elements to it. YES! I understand thats what the movie is about, but movies like Die Hard can keep their action realistic. The two scenes that come to my mind especially are the fridge scene and one time when four soldiers open up on Indy with AKs while he is running across OPEN ground and all the bullets miss him. I did like the sword fighting scene, though, it did come out of nowhere.I think the problem many people have with this movie is maturity. From what I hear this is not the Indiana Jones of the past. I also know many people hated the plot with aliens, but upon hearing the plot of the other movies, this seems to have the best plot next to the Raiders.In conclusion, go see this movie. Do not listen to these angry people giving the movie a 1 or 2 out of ten because Indy was not cast as Johnny Depp, or something stupid like that. I can see though where some people can get angry at the film but I would not disagree with someone who gives it an 8 or 9 out of ten. So enough reading these reviews.

1149,cutmaclass,Acceptable,6,23 May 2008,"The movie works really well until the halfway mark, in which all of its great pacing is taken out to the field and shot. At that point, situations (monkeys, big damn ants, waterfalls, aliens, etc.) become less and less plausible and end up frustrating all but the very numbest of viewers. Giving credit where it is due, though, Harrison Ford does well and the development of the antagonist is better than average. The best that can be said for this movie is that it stands out among its summer peers; yes, Iron Man was great and all, but this Indiana Jones, no matter how it compares to Raiders or Crusade, offers the kind of adventure that you come to realize is all too rare in the current market. At the very least, it's better than all three of the newer Star Wars movies.For the record, I actually loved the alien concept; it fit very well with the mythos of the movie and made as much sense as any moderately engaged viewer could ask for. It's simply the execution that was (mostly) flawed. That pretty much comes hand in hand with the ""overabundance of CGI"" theory; if Spielberg had simply left more to the imagination (and perhaps left behind the half-baked love interest and son) then we might have had a real winner on our hands.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Spielberg and Lucas are quite literally off their bloody rockers at this point, they'd be wise to quit while they are still SOMEWHAT ahead. Good acting overall, but nothing more than that. Shia LeBoeuf was the lone bright spot. Harrison Ford was fine, but I have high expectations when he is involved in a project and considering his age, he wasn't able to fully deliver, but still did damn well with that kept in mind.

1153,shakezuulla,"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, ""It's worth it...Trust Me.""",7,14 July 2008,"Well, here we are 19 years after the Last Crusade with another Indiana Jones adventure. My first impression, I thought it fell way off the mark and was highly disappointed. Upon second viewing I realized that my expectations were really high and I finally got to enjoy the film for what it is...a good Indiana Jones adventure.Is it perfect...No. Is it Raiders of the Lost Ark?...Let's face it, nothing will ever be like Raiders of the Lost Ark. In fact, no other Indy movie really comes close, but it's always good to see Dr. Jones in another high scale adventure. Kindom of the Crystal Skull is just that. Is there a lot of CGI?...If you think you are going to see a movie on the scale of Indiana Jones in 2008 and not see a good portion of CGI...I hate to let you down, but that's the world we are living in today...all the high budget action flicks are going to have a good amount of CGI.Now I have heard many people complain about the content of Indy's adventure within this movie...granted, I didn't really know if I could buy it after seeing it. Then I started to put the elements together. Given the year of 1957 in which the movie takes place, it could not have been a better representation of that era. At first I thought George Lucas and Steven Spielberg lost their minds, but then I started to add it all up and realized they pulled it off.Everything you can think of in a 1950's Sci-Fi B movie is represented here with that classic Indiana Jones flare. America is in the middle of the Cold War and everybody is afraid of communism, Russians and of course nuclear war. It is a time of greasers, rock and roll, fast cars and of course government conspiracy. Tarzan, UFO and Giant Bug movies are big hits at the local drive-in movie theaters. The Roswell incident happen 10 years prior to the events in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. All these elements are a perfect setting for our favorite pulp hero to put on his hat and go into action. Keep all this in mind while viewing this movie.All the actors are having fun with their parts. It is as if they couldn't wait to do another Indiana Jones movie! Yes there is a lot of over the top stuff, but this is Indiana Jones what do you expect from the globe trotting archaeologist? Granted, some of it is really over the top, but for the most part, it gets a lot of laughs if you take it light hearted.It is clear that we got the best of the best during the 1980's when it comes to Indiana Jones, but it's good to see Henry Jones Jr. don the fedora one more time in a grand adventure of the 1950's. If they were going to be Indiana in this time period, this was the way to do it. It worked perfectly.Overall this movie is meant to be a lot of fun. If you saw it once and were highly disappointed, see it again, you might be surprised to find that you like it the second time you see it. Everything seems to fall into place and it feels that you are on an adventure with old friends. Just seeing Indy crack his whip after 19 years is worth the price of admission alone.""It's worth it Marion, Trust me.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1154,chademe,A real disappointment,3,2 June 2011,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, it's hard to know where to begin.1.

The worst scene was the one involving the ants. It's absolutely gruesome how some of those people die, and it did nothing to further the story. I almost turned it off at that point. That scene also has Indy fighting one of the Russians, and they simply punch each other over and over again for several minutes. Removing these short sequences would have improved the movie tremendously.2. Mutt - he's just annoying. The whole ""greaser"" thing is annoying.3. the story - it just wasn't that great. The Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail are exciting because of all the history behind them. The Crystal Skull just seemed corny. I still don't understand why the Indians were still there guarding it. Have they been there for the last 500 years? The movie had to work too hard to explain how Mutt found Indy and convinced him to go find Ox. It was too contrived.4. Mac - Why bother? He didn't really do anything in the movie. His character could have been completely eliminated.5. Russian Commander - I can't remember her name. Was her performance supposed to be tongue in cheek? Because it looked like something out of a bad 50's B movie. In fact, a lot of this looked like something out of a bad 50's B movie. So much so that I wonder if it was intentional.In general, the movie was pretty disappointing. I was excited about another Indiana Jones movie, but this simply was not very enjoyable. I don't know if they're making another Indiana Jones movie or not, but this is probably the last one I'll watch.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1155,cdwebdesign,The worst movie I have seen in about 5 years,1,25 June 2008,"I would have walked out of the theater had I driven my own vehicle. Terrible acting, action sequences that went WAY over the top of the already pushing it Indy stuff, surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge that tumbles a mile away without a scratch to show for it? They crammed about 2 million ideas into this film, smashed it all together with some insane ideas about aliens and it sucked! What was with the 'tell me what you know' thing at the end? And the 13 alien's 'tell her' with their eyes just before combining from the 'hive-mind' into a single tangible being and then with an evil look setting her on fire with it's mind-powers? And then flying away in it's space-ship?The only questions this film left with me were: 1. How can I regain these two hours of my life that have been lost. and 2. Is Spielberg friends with Mr. Travolta and Mr. Cruise? That was quite a switch from biblical inspired ancient artifacts to a magnetic brain aliens and a spaceship..Terrible. If they make a box set of all 4 and you buy it, keep the first three great ones, and burn this one; I do believe it is crap.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1156,max-787,"Good I guess, but now i'm looking forward to the Dark Knight more",7,23 May 2008,"Indiana Jones 4 (I'm not going to call it Kingdom of the Crystal Skull because that's such a bad title) has been canned quite a lot so far, but it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's received. I thought that there was another great Indiana Jones movie in there buried beneath weird alien subplots and too much odd 50s nostalgia.It was pretty lame at some points and ridiculously cartoonish at all points, but Steven Spielberg managed to stomach nearly all of the George Lucas poison and make it enjoyable. I was excited when I heard it was going to be about the Mayans or Aztecs or whatever they were, but the whole aliens thing killed it. I had faith that Steven Spielberg was better than that, but I guess not. They should remake this movie without the aliens. Also what was with the nuclear explosion????? It was a good scene, but did not fit in Indiana Jones AT ALL. And please cut the ""Shia swinging with monkeys"" scene.I loved the South America tomb raiding part with Harrison Ford and Shia Lebeouf and the motorcycle chase and I felt like there was a really great film buried in there.Overall, despite being entertaining and very clever at points, Indiana Jones 4 was just a frustrating movie, mostly thanks to the aliens.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1157,blusa,They lost their minds,7,8 June 2008,"Wow, Mr. Spielberg, WOW! Thanks for ruining it for me. It was great to see Harrison Ford back in the game, really was. I love Indiana Jones, always will. But to see ""Mutt Williams"" (come on) flying like some Tarzan with the bunch of excited CGI monkeys was too much. There and then the movie had ended for me. They shouldn't have even bothered with the dramatic alien space ship. I didn't come to see the X-files, i wanted another mysterious history-related little story. Indiana just doesn't seem..COSMIC. By the way, it's always a laugh to listen to Hollywood actors try to speak Russian. I know Russian and I speak Russian, however they can't even FAKE speaking Russian. Well done, Cate, but not well enough. I've given a seven because giving a six to Indiana Jones would frankly bring tears to my eyes.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1158,ramzaw,Great Indiana Jones! They didn't screw it up.,9,24 May 2008,"The first thing I'd like to say: people that are grading it down most likely went in, thinking it was going to be the best Indiana Jones film made. I went in pretty much hoping it would be okay - and hell, was I given a good surprise! From start to finish, it was Indiana Jones. Sure, he's older - but still Indiana Jones.Here's a little spoiler for some people: The movie gets to be a little sci-fi. To those who don't like that, here's what I have to say. Don't complain about it! I thought they pulled it off extremely well! Besides, can you name one movie along the lines of ""Indiana Jones and the Perfectly Normal Day?"" Indiana Jones has never had a ""Normal"" adventure; he's seen hearts get pulled out of someone, with the victim still alive; he's seen people's faces melt and explode; he's seen a guy grow incredibly old, incredibly fast. He goes on awesome adventures that are not ""normal"".Sure, the movie uses CGI. But that enhanced it. The CGI added to the jokes sometimes, or just to the story. I thought the ending was AWESOME.One thing I am hearing people complain about is the fact that (SPOLER AGAIN!): Indiana Jones lived through a Nuclear Blast by hiding in a fridge. A lot of the people who complain about this are people who are not historically informed. Refrigerators in the 1950's were freaking' LEAD. Their walls were made of thick LEAD. And, it's Indiana Jones. Those two facts put together, and come on. Accept that he can live the blast. If he'd died there, the movie would have ended there. Great movie, huh? It's a joke that many get, and many don't, because they didn't want to listen in history classes, or do some research themselves, or have an imagination. It's sad, really.Okay, another spoiler: Yes, the movie has aliens. But they puled it off. And again, it's INDIANA JONES. It's made to be fun. Some people say it doesn't make sense. Okay, because melting faces, people alive with no hearts, and one aging 1000 years in mere seconds makes total sense. Just GO WITH IT.And LeBouf did really well, by the way, if anyone's curious. not that I had any doubts that he would.My overall impression of the movie: It was GREAT. A breath of fresh air. With Lucas's recent work, I thought he was going to horribly screw it up. Much to my great surprise, he didn't. It was truly an Indiana Jones film, I'm proud to say. Everyone reprized their roles excellently - and they didn't just forget about characters. They mentioned characters - and no, tragically, Sean Connery isn't in the movie. They talk about him once, and his character was already dead. Just so you know, it makes sense: even though he DID drink from the cup of Christ, once they head past the seal (in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), the immortality is broken, and they are mortal again. It's simple, and makes sense. So Dr. Henry Jones Sr. is dead. Sorry, everyone. No plot spoiler there, though.So, the movie was great. A bunch of CGI, but a bunch of special effects, too. They didn't focus completely on CGI, which I was happy about. And there were stunts, some of which seemed... well, impossible - but go with it. The movie's supposed to be fun, not Forrest Gump - or another Academy Award winner.The main thing: Go in, not expecting it to be the best one. And you will be happily satisfied.But see it on the big screen. If I'm stating this wrong, It's not like I liked it because I thought it was going to be bad. I liked it because I went in, not thinking it was going to be the greatest, but expecting to be entertained.And it was MUCH better than the Temple of Doom, and, in my opinion, almost on par with Raiders. And some may disagree, which I respect (I don't respect them bashing what could make sense with some research or imagination, though...). But the movie was great.10/10, by far. Good job, Spielberg and Lucas.I truly hope this review helped.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

How is that possible?*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***I knew I was in for a bad time from the moment the Paramount logo dissolved into a mound of dirt with a ""cute"" CGI gopher popping out and staring at me. Oh god, no ...Then the pointless drag race with ""Hound Dog"" playing that went on and on and on and on as I wondered if I'd wandered into the wrong movie.Things picked up a little bit at the military warehouse, but then came another pointless sequence involving a rocket sled, only to be followed by a creepy trip into a faux 50s suburb and the now infamous ""nuke the fridge"" baloney.Almost everything about this movie was wrong, wrong, wrong, from the story to the dialog to the acting to the new characters. Lucas and Spielberg completely blew the big reunion scene btwn Indy and Marion Ravenwood. I was excited to see Karen Allen return to the series, but she looked glassy eyed and her character seemed more insane than John Hurt's babbling hobo did.Harrison Ford didn't show a lick of interest in his character and didn't seem to believe a word of what he was saying. He struck me as someone who's simply lost interest in acting and wanted to be somewhere else, maybe flying his airplane or trying on earrings with Ally McBeal.I found it particularly unsatisfying (and odd) that, after so much was made of Ford's age, almost nothing was done to take advantage of it, not counting his obnoxious illegitimate son referring to him as ""old man"" several times. Why not at least one scene in which Indy is out of breath? He complained more about aches and pains in ""Raiders"" when the character was 25 years younger!The movie ended with a heinously goofy, unbelievable wedding scene that rang totally false and out of character with the rest of the movie and the rest of the franchise, replacing the bad taste in my mouth left by the flying saucer only moments before with something even worse. I wanted to like this movie. I really did. And I wasn't expecting much. I figured if it was equivalent in quality to ""T3"" in the Terminator franchise, I'd be happy.

What i think i wanted to really feel afterwards was 8 again, you know the time when after watching Indy you wanted to feel there was a job where you can go on adventures forever!!! But it didn't do that!! There was adventure in it yes, the point up to finding the ""Crystal Skull"" got me believing in Indy again with maps, riddles and everything!! The car chase was overdone, but still you could possibly still believe in Indy. The Sidekick, girl, and baddies could still afterwards have been OK. But the finale?!?!? What Lucas was thinking when he was doing that scene i do not know!!! The shock was hurtful, especially as the build up was about acceptable and brought some of the classic Indy back!!! Up till the point where Indy found the main bit of the Temple, i would have given it 8/10! But as soon as you found out what Indy had found, it lost the film all its credit it had built!!!

1162,therealgodfather-1,Worst ending ever!,5,22 May 2008,"It doesn't feel like any other Indy movie: this is a Spielberg closer to Catch me if you can than the other movies. It's great and it has plenty of references, from West Side Story to Vertigo, the show feels like very good until that ending. It's so boring, and the marriage of Indy is so awful and sad. That's not our hero because in every other movie there was a Jones girl. Like James Bond. That's it. Not more because the story of the crystal of skull feels like an Indiana exploit like the Zemeckis movie with Douglas or the Pirates of the Carribbean. If the treausre has no sense, the villain (a great performance by Cate Blanchett) isn't cruel enough all feels like a brilliant parody, with great visual work and some memorable action pieces, like the car chase in the jungle. The actors are great and the director is doing really good.

1163,gorosaur1,Indiana Jones and the Close Encounters of the Third Kind,10,24 May 2008,"Ever since I heard about the possible release of new Indiana Jones film I was bursting with excitement and skepticism. THe original trilogy are some of my favorite movies of all time, and I still hold an opinion that Raiders of the Lost ARk is the best action picture of all time. However I was skeptical about how a new film would be pulled off. It wasn't Indy's age that worried me seeing as I have a very high respect for Harrison Ford, but I was worried about how George Lucas and Steven Spielberg might go about this new film. My worries were unfounded.The first thing people need to realize about the Kingdom of the Crystal SKull and all the Indiana Jones films is that they are and always will be period films. The idea for Indiana Jones was originally based upon 1930's serials, and the first 3 did good for that time period. However, Lucas and Spielberg both realized that due to Harrisons advancing age that the film needed to be place further into the future. (the 1950's) However, adventure serials weren't part of the film mainstream at the time. And Sci-fi films were. This is why Kingdom of the Crystal Skull truly ascends. The filmmakers made a B movie sci-fi fitting of the period, but also kept its original Indy flair. All the requirements for a good indy movie are kept. (the action pieces, the battles between Indy and a world power be it Russians or Nazis, the creatures, and the encounters with super natural.) Those who find the alien aspect of this film to be out of place only need to look at Lucas's and Spielberg's reasoning. (see above) And if they find the story of the aliens unrealistic then they honestly need to rewatch the original movies seeing as their is nothing any more unreal in this film then there were in the previous films. 10/10 Easily one of the best Indy films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

OK, so I have seen it, my sons enjoyed it though the story was weak. Would not bother to watch it again even when its on the telly! I don't know where Lucas and Spielberg get their ideas from when doing a remake/rehash. The last 3 star wars where Crap and what Spielberg did to war of the worlds was also poor.

1165,odinbetafish,Welcome back Dr. Jones...,7,23 May 2008,"I was more than happy when I first heard there will be another Indiana Jones. The first three films came out before I was born and my childhood was mostly spent watching them on VHS. So when I heard I was going to get a chance to see Indy on the big screen I was beyond joy. However I had become very skeptical of Steven Speilburg ever since Schinler's List which in it's own was a good movie. But his films just haven't been the same since. And I was willing to kill him after he cast Shia LaBuff as Mutt Williams, not that I think he's a bad actor it's that he has yet to deserve such a pivotal role. However in the end they managed to bring us yet another good Indiana adventure. Not nearly as good as the others and with some of the worst CGI since I Am Legend, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was still an entertaining Idiana adventure that gives me hope for at least two better sequels.

Great casts, great action sequence, great storyline, and great way to spent time in cinema. Although, I must say it's better than Temple of Doom, but in fun, Last Crusade and Lost Ark were better than Crystal Skull. There were a bit of dull moments, some sequences in the beginning that I think great for storyline but a bit too long and unnecessary. I think beginning in the middle of the movie, the pace becomes much to my liking like the way I used to know in previous Indy movies. I didn't expect this movie to break into a new territory but for a part of this franchise this is a great way to end it. Now, I wish there were more Indy after this one.

There were no elements which were exciting or thrilling. Nothing seemed to work in this movie. It was recycled from the past but without any charm or wit. Not the Indie we all grow up with! Harrison Ford still looking good, but he wasn't a patch on his other performances. Nice to see Karen Allen. Still a good looking girl and a fun actress.

I didn't really feel anything for them after I watched them. I thought: 'That was fun' And never thought much of them again. The same thing happened with this movie. It was fun, good, nothing special. The action scenes followed the same style as the first three, over the top and comedic. There was that old fashioned 'discovery' and Indy still had the personality that made Indy 'Indy'.It seems people gave their final opinions based on the final scene of this film: The Aliens. After watching a man's heart torn from his chest while he was still alive in the second Indiana Jones film, I personally don't think the leap to Aliens is such a big deal.This film had it's annoying one-liners, some of the scenes were unrealistic to say the least.

Don't get me wrong. I love Harrison and Steven and their movies. But this one just made me sad.In one of the opening scenes, the one with Indy's first dialogue, Kaminski's lighting was horrible. I was thinking, ""There's no way the whole movie is shot like this."" And then came Indy's lines. They sounded like a really bad ADR session. Almost like Harrison had his voice box removed, no one told the public -like it's our business anyway, and then used some guy off the street to voice Indy. I was just shaking my head and thinking, really thinking, that it was all a bad dream.Harrison did start to sound like himself. But half of the movie was about 'how much older everyone was'. Like we didn't notice. Like we wanted to be reminded... Yes, action was there. More than enough.

Remember the bridge scene from temple of doom? The tank chase from the third movie? The barfight in the first movie? These were all well-crafted action scenes in which you actually cared about the characters, you felt a sense of peril, you were thrilled as the scenes unfolded. This time around, there aren't any thrills, the action scenes are goofy and cartoonish with nothing scary or suspenseful about them. To the film's credit, not all the scenes are bad. The humor is quite good, and the chase scene on campus towards the beginning of the film was almost on the same quality level as the original trilogy.

1174,willidke,"Indy Newcomers May Be Entertained, Indy Veterans May Be Disappointed",6,14 June 2008,"When I first heard that they will be making a fourth Indiana Jones film, I could not contain my excitement. It was a dream come true! Now, its been 4 days since i've seen the film, and I've had enough time to digest the movie. ""Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" is the most different film of the series. First of all, it takes place in a different decade, the 50's. And with that comes the 50's problems, which the movie portrays excellently; Communism, Aliens, Atomic Bombs, etc. There are also many new faces to the new Indy film; Shia LeBueff, Cate Blanchett, John Hurt, etc. The Films PROS: Harisson Ford looks as good as he was in the first 3 movies, The return of Marion Ravenwood was a delight, and some of the action sequences were spectacular and genuinely entertaining! The Films CONS: The film seems like it is trying WAY too hard to be a blockbuster, the special effects are as abundant as the bad story line that the movie runs on; and Indiana Jones did not become famous because of the special effects they used. To elaborate on the plot, there seemed no REAL motivation for this movie, yeah there was one, but it seemed really forced and tired. It also seems like they brought Marion Ravenwood back into the picture because they needed someone to be a cab-driver for Indy and his side-kick Mutt Williams (Shia). There was really no scene where Indy and Ravenwood really fleshed out their relationship. And most people will agree that the ending was the most ridiculous ending a movie could have, its an excuse to add mother loads of special effects, I think George Lucas is to blame for that.Overall Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was very disappointing, not awful; there were some really entertaining scenes, but not what you would expect from a Spielberg/Lucas film that was 19 years in the making.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Oh, and no need to worry about nuclear war, just build a giant fridge and we can all live happily ever after just venturing outside the fridge door every now and then to toast marshmallows and gasp and the strange beauty of a mushroom cloud. Shia the beef's character, dressed as Marlon Brando from the wild bunch showed a particular lack of imagination (complete with a George Lucas hair-cut). Ray Winstone's character was just a gruesome death waiting to happen, but nothing, no melting face, no falling off a cliff screaming into the camera, he just let go of the rope and floated off. talking of rope, i mean snake, no, i mean rope, can anyone tell me what the heck the whole quick-sand-use-a-rubber-snake-to-get-me-out what that was about because to me it just seemed completely bizarre.

1176,sean-diamond2,"Good, but it should have been great...",7,18 February 2009,"Firstly, i just want to make it clear that this is in no way a bad film. It has plenty of over the top action sequences, some decent acting and lots of amusing one liners. It's just not a great film. The previous Indy films, in my opinion, are all stone cold cinematic classics, and probably always will be. The fourth installment, well, it's hard to put a finger on precisely what makes it considerably weaker than the previous three, but i'll have a go.Many critics believed the story line to be weak. This is not true. The story, involving Indy travelling to the outer reaches of South America in order to find a near-mythical skull made from crystal, is as good as any of the others'. The execution is what drags the film down. The film is uneven and sloppily paced; as a result, it only possesses a fraction of the dramatic tension and sense of adventure of the previous films. The camera lurches rather unconvincingly into one setpiece after another without really giving any pause for thought. Another major hindrance are the special effects. The ending, featuring some ridiculous CGI animated pixellated aliens, is one of the worst i have ever seen in a major motion picture. Whilst supposedly technologically superior to film effects of yore, most CGI effects lack any imagination or feeling, and as a result will always suffer in comparison with those that were peddled out in the eighties. It's a real shame. If the film were better paced, and the effects more convincing, this would easily have matched up to the previous installments, as there is really nothing else wrong with the film. Entertaining, well worth watching, but ultimately disappointing. There really isn't much else that can be said.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It has all the traditional stuff, whip, side kick, Marion, why hate it.And over all, it's not the destination, it's the journey.

Anyone who says it is a 1 star movie has had a frontal labotomy.A few facts, the film is based in 1957 the period of the Cold War, hostilities with Russia, Alien paranoia, Area 51 and Alien cover ups, bikers and the birth of rock and roll. Hence the fact the film is also based on these themes, get it ?, I know its hard to take in if you've had a frontal labotomy but this is why the film has these themes in it.Times have moved on from the second world war.

1179,tedbaccich4,Terribly Disappointing,2,27 May 2008,"Just as they did in the second generation of Star Wars Movies, Spielberg and Lucas have badly damaged a film Icon. Only this time the effect is worse. The plot is slow and focuses on a Crystal Skull, the significance of which (I think) one has to consult you local New Age weirdo to understand. It seems that this crystal skull has great power and can control minds, animal life, magnetism, and a whole slew of other things. This is because the crystal skull comes from Aliens ... yes, you are reading correctly ... it comes from space men. The ending of this movie is so stupid it reminds me of a really bad X Files episode. And most of the parts in between are pretty bad too. The opening is exciting enough but it is all down hill from there.Karen Allen reprises her role as Marion Ravenwood, only now she looks like Joan Collins without the wig and the botox. That is to say she looks old, ate up and a bit nuts. Harrison Ford is good enough but he simply can't carry this ridiculous plot on his sheer star power. No one could. This movie is just plain silly, and not in a good way. There is just so much alien nonsense and new age conjecture in this plot that it is JUST NOT BELIEVABLE. For a movie to be good and suspenseful, there has to be some semblance of believability. This one DOES NOT HAVE IT. Save your money and rent it when it comes out on DVD (if you must). This one just ain't worth it.BTW, my ""2"" rating is for Harrison Ford alone. Other than him, this movie should get a 1.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1180,mr-wy1994,not the Indy feel,6,26 May 2008,"honestly, this movie was worth the ticket. It was halfway decent, but it needed a lot more to give the Indy fans what they wanted. Most of the movie was a flat, cookie-cutting use of film. And when it did have action, it didn't know when to stop! it went waay over the top, like so much, most of the stunts and action would be physically impossible for a normal human being. Plus most of the stuff in the movie you could figure out halfway through the movie. Now the acting was pretty good, but needed to be a little bit more realistic, there's not much more to say. The plot was just bad, i'm not going to give anything away but I think that Speildberg tried a little to hard to believe in the 50's. But it would entertain you if you were a action fan, but if you are a Indy fan, and going to see the movie, don't expect anything to compare to ""Raiders"". Overall the makers could have done a lot better giving the Indy feel to a Indy fan. :{",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1181,Cody2310,"Not exactly ""Indiana"", but still good",7,25 May 2008,"I am a huge fan of the original Indiana Jones'. I was very much looking forward to seeing the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but I was somewhat disappointed.The film itself is not too bad: the script is witty and imaginative, acting was quite impressive (Shia LeBouf was excellent) and the special effects were, for the most part, exciting and believable. What really hurt this movie, I believe, is the story. It was..not ""Indiana Jones"". It seemed to be chopped up and thrown together and was very hard to follow at times.The movie starts out quite good; action packed and full of mystery, like the good old Indiana's. However, somewhere along the way, it seemed Spielburg just ran out of ideas and took the picture down a rather strange path. The film lacked...direction, is the best way to say it. It just seemed to be missing the old treasure hunting, archaeological excitement that captured me in the originals.There are some positives. I was very pleased to see Harrison Ford back in action and it was a comfort to see he had not lost his passion for the role, the same with Karen Allen. There were several references to the originals which helped make the connection and there is some very funny dialogue delivered flawlessly. As an overall movie and by itself, the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is good, but in comparison and as an addition to the original trilogy, it is sub-par. A different story and approach could have made this movie a lot better but still a good film. 7/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1182,ammar456,Lots of Indy Style fun,9,21 May 2008,"Yup, a good 2 decades after the last installment of Indiana Jones, he's back, and up to his regular doings; running around caves and graves, beating up bad guys, jumping from one thrilling stunt to another, and giving us a good laugh in between.He doesn't disappoint either; even with Harrison Ford at 64 years old, Indiana doesn't really look that much older than in his last movie, and he can still perform his good ol' action sequences.Although not exactly an Oscar winning storyline, the movie is good fun to watch. The fighting and chase sequences are thrilling, and there's enough good old Indiana-esquire humor to keep everyone smiling in between. I won't spoil the plot , but it's set a good 10 years or so after the last movie, and the Soviets have captured Indiana, hoping he will lead them to a secret that could help them control the world (cheesy script, but it makes a fun story). There's also a whip, a snake, Indiana's famous hat (that he never lets go of, no matter what), an epic ending, and a few surprises in between.The whole thing looks like it was filmed in the 80's, which is great in a world dominated by obvious CGI and digital filming.(full review on www.ammaro.com)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1183,indyfan2009,There is good and bad...,7,24 May 2008,"Well...Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull....if any blame is needed (which it is) it should be pointed to George Lucas. This movie did not suck, in my opinion, but it was not what it could have been. I think Raiders is one of the greatest movies ever created. And every Indy movie since, I adore. This one, I'm indifferent about. But, the more i think about it, the more i begin to like it. I am planning on a second viewing, and I think I will enjoy it more then. The most classic Indy scene in the entire movie is the motorcycle chase. Why? NO CGI!!!!! Plus it is classic Indy (being pulled in a car, beat guys up, climb out of car, back onto bike). After the sword fight standing up on the movie ""boat-cars"", it began to lose me. Before then, it had been a good Indy film. Then, more and more CGI came into play. The ONLY CGI i was happy with (sortof) was the Russian woman's demise. Burning up is another classic Indy Villain death. The majority of the action, and dialogue i was happy with. But the story line didn't grab me. Aliens? That is not what Indy deals with. It seems to me like the religious Indy movies are better. (Im pulling for Indiana Jones 5 and something religious like the garden of eden or a 3rd tablet of commandments or the cross of Christ) A UFO? Come on!!! NOT INDY!!! The first 3/4 of the movie, i was happy with, but the last quarter should burn in hell.

That made sense. Oh, and the actors were necessary. In Crystal Skulls, it feels like the director could have substituted any name for any of the roles, and the movie would have been just as ""good"" (I put good in quotes because this movie's not even good). Oh, and in Temple of Doom, Indiana didn't act like a total wuss. For goodness sake, he cut a bridge in half. How much more of a stud can you be?? (It seems like this movie was made out of fear of ""missing out"" on Harrison Ford's last few years of productivity. I think he stills has some gas left in the tank, but his performance in this movie was like putting gas in the tank of a Pinto instead of a Lexus.) The movie doesn't need to be bashed much more, and I know that nothing I say will stop people from going to see another Indiana Jones movie. Just know this - it could have easily been MUCH better. MUCH better. Enjoy!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1186,jazzbo32,Indiana Jones and the Curse of the 21st Century...,5,29 May 2008,"As a massive fan of the first three I was pretty disappointed by the latest instalment. I enjoyed the references to the previous films and some of the action sequences were fairly involving in true Lucas/Spielberg style.Beyond that the film was way OTT and the plot was lame, with a subject matter that lent itself more to a budget, conspiracy themed sci-fi than the beguiling historical mysticism of the previous jaunts. Ford is also showing his age in this one, and, although he is playing an older character, he moves and delivers his lines too sluggishly and this is a long way from the heroic and witty performance we fell in love with back in the day. Having said that I would have found it more annoying if they had cast somebody else as Indiana.OK, the early ones had unrealistic action sequences and location jumps but this one takes the biscuit and is genuinely laughable, and not in a particularly good way either. The bad guys lacked the menace or believability of the Nazi's or the sorcerer's in Temple (Ruskies's in Peru? During the cold war??) and the relationship between Indy and his ex is a little unconvincing.I thought 'Jr' (Shia LaBeouf) was fairly well casted and the performance was one of the more believable (vine swinging through the jungle apart) and I think he should maybe take over the key role in future episodes. However, I would like to see a return to stunts and action sequences that are less computer generated and false as these are the scenes that put your heart in your mouth and keep you on the edge of your seat.Overall, an average family action film with all the flashy lights and dumbed down plots required to keep todays e number fuelled kids happy, saved only by the fact that it references, and is a continuation of, three incredible action films, the likes of which we are unlikely to see again in this era of special effects and uncredible stunt action.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1187,UltraVenom,Best 2008 Sequel,8,5 August 2008,"First off I really enjoyed this movie. I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark. Never got much into Temple of Doom or The Last Crusade. For 19 years I just always preferred to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark than any of the rest of them. But now Lucas and Spielberg have done an Indiana Jones sequel that met my expectations. Though plenty of people seemed to hate this movie. Such as I read a few of these user commits before creating my own. Plenty of people made remarks about how they should put the DVD of KOTCS in the $3 bin at Wal-mart. Then other remarks about how they will pretend this movie doesn't exist. First off I don't know why most of these KOTCS haters even use up there time complaining about why they hate the film. When I hate a movie I usually won't talk about it on the message boards or user commits on this site. I have more fun committing on a movie I enjoyed.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with entertain most of the Indiana Jones fans that have been hyped up for 19 years for another film. Others that don't like the fact it is more of a Science Fiction film, than an Adventure like the previous Indy films will be disappointed. For me I really enjoyed Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, because I knew a little while after The Last Crusade there was talk of a fourth movie. I remember hearing rumorers of Marion Ravenwood coming back into the movies. Which I was real happy to see her return, she was my favorite girlfriend Indiana had threw the series. I went to go see KOTCS on May 22nd the day it was released. I got a little confused with the ending. But overall liked the movie, enjoyed seeing Harrison Ford back as Indy, and Mutt Williams played by Shia LaBeouf. I also liked the fact that it centers around an Alien Temple and an Alien Skull. Yeah, I will admit it was kinda weird to see the UFO take off in an Indiana Jones film. But overall I except the fact that this is 19 years later from the first 3 films. I guess the Lucas and Spielberg decided that another film should be about Aliens since plenty of people these days are interested into wondering if aliens are real or not. I also like how it reminds me of the movie StarGate, like how the fact that people wonder if Aliens helped build the temples of Eypyt. I'm a Scifi fan so I really was glad to get an Indy film that is about an Alien story. I like how when the movie first begins it gets straight to the point with Russians going after an artifact that Indiana Jones discovered, and is the one that can help them find it in the Top Secret Government Warehouse. The movie also gets to be real enjoyable once Indiana first meet Mutt Williams, and they travel to Peru in search of an old friend named Oxley. This really was a great movie. I'm glad it is the second highest Grossing movie of the year. Only The Dark Knight beating it, because all the fan-boys are going crazy for that movie. Which I did see and wasn't even that good. I choose Indy 4, The Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man for the best Summer movies of 2008. KOTCS also had an awesome comic book and soundtrack to it as well. Well worth the 19 year wait if you ask me. I know most people loved The Last Crusade, but that one I found kinda boring. So Raiders of the Lost Ark and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull are my two favorite Indy films. 8 out of 10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The saddest part of all is that if Mr. Spielberg had been serious about this we know he could have made a much more intelligent picture. Spielberg is capable of good, even great work (""Shindler's List"", ""Munich"") but he can also crank out the box-office fodder as well (""Jurassic Park"", ""Minority Report"").""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was a kitchen sink of movie clichés right down to the cheesy Marlon Brando ""The Wild One"" rip-off.I've finally stop ranting about how terribly awful this movies actually is.

There were rumours of its production deliberately spread long before its release and the film was kept overly secretive during its production in order to produce as much interest and curiosity into this film as possible, I hate it when they do that! The film is made by two legends in the industry Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and typically had more money than a small country! It would have been a tragedy for this film to flop. The creators have stuck to the original principles of the previous films which if you have read any of my other reviews is I feel the key to the success of a sequel to a classic series. The one thing I loved about the film was it felt like it had actually been created in the 80's. You could have been watching a VHS that you found in the back of the cupboard and I loved that. You may however not choose to agree with me. This film is good because of the reasons above. It is however ruined by the ending. The success of the previous Indy films for me was that although there story lines and characters were bizarre and extraordinary, they were believable and based on historical culture etc. The kingdom of the crystal skull teeters on the edge of being unbelievable but is just enough to sustain your faith in the storyline and actual feel interested in how the film is going to turn out. This is unfortunately ruined as the film concludes. I would not recommend this film.

I should admit I'm not a fan of too much CGI, as it tends to make me feel distant from the action, so I don't feel like I'm there. Indiana Jones had some of those moments. Especially when Mutt was swinging through the vines like Tarzan, that was way too much.Also, it just felt so different from the previous Indy films, especially when the aliens started to show up. I was just scratching my head as if to say ""Come on, this is Indiana Jones, not Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""

So when I heard this movie was finally gonna hit the screen I leaped for joy. I went to the midnight showing of this film, odered a small pizza and a large root beer to celebrate the return of indy.5 minutes into the film I had a feeling where this movie was going. The film had a look of CGI immediately almost as it was super clean or super lit up, making the natural settings blend into the fake sets of the film. Not in a good way either where you would be like, where is the CGI? more like hey where are the natural surroundings the previous films had? The scene where Indy leaps into a fridge to avoid a nuclear Holacaust seemed a little to silly for me and for Indy, maybe a more suitable for a Rodger Moore 007 film.Then we are subjected to Spielbergs long going for ""Shia Lebeuff"" and plays off the character as Indy's long lost son OK but didn't even need to be in the film due to the films 1 to many characters.The film does play Homage to Sean Connery which is great but at the same time wished he was in the film. The movie goes on and on about a silly aliens, a crystal skull which looks like a big hunk of plastic that weighs nothing. The antagonists in this film are the Russians and who seem so non threatening, and unfortunately makes you beg for the Nazzis to return to these films.An older INdy I think is a great idea and I wanted this film to be so good so badly and the one great scene in this film was the motorcycle scene in the library and it felt like an Indy film @ this point finally. But the movie loses all credibility when the jungle scene enters and Shia decides hes Tarzan and swings with the monkeys, and once again the film looks a like a green screen.If any of the readers of these blogs watch"" SOuth Park"" there is an episode dedicated of the horrible-ness which is this film. I believe the episode is called"" China Probrem"", anyway by the time the jungle scene was done the movie might as well turned off. There were no redeeming points.

Recurring characters and items from the past movies. The fact that they continued the time line and character development. Bad things: The script was pretty bad. Aliens. I expected Mulder and Scully to jump in the movie at some point. The new characters needed more work. Mac the guy that played Indy's friend was completely useless for the movie.

Very Entertaining film.",9,23 May 2008,"Whether so-called Indiana Jones ""purists"" want to admit it or not this is an Indy film through and through. There are just several things you have to keep in mind as you watch this movie.1) This is Indiana Jones in the late 1950's not the 1930's. Fighting, weapons, mindsets, social atmospheres are way different in this decade.2) Just because Indy's not fighting Nazi's doesn't mean it's not a good film. This film is better than Temple of Doom and I think Temple of Doom is good.3) Indy is older too and they do a great job of showing his age both in his actions and in his dialog.4) Every Indy film requires that you believe something that is unbelievable; Ark still exists (#1), Man pulls heart out of person's chest and person still lives (#2), Knight living in cave for over 1,000 years just waiting for someone to show up (#3), Planet has been visited by aliens (#4). Out of the four the last is easy to believe.Bottom line: The film is fun, entertaining, the music is recognizable along with some new pieces, you will laugh and enjoy it. They do an excellent job of depicting the mindset of people in the 50's both young and old. I've seen it three times and every time the entire theater applauded at the end.Don't listen to complainers and critics who feel they are experts when all they do is go to movies looking for the things they don't like.

1195,otorrinolaringologista,i've been almost two decades waiting for this,2,22 May 2008,"Well, first of all it was watching the last crusade on theaters that made me want to direct my own movies, the others i watched on home video and the more i watched the more enthusiastic i was on the following raiders sequel.I was born in the 80s so i never watched a Republic Serial in my life, so i didn't knew that language that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to transmit with that, anyway. Now i know that format because i became obsessed with cinematic languages that would give birth to the b movie as we know it, to the trash phenomenon and now, unfortunately to the Pop «Korny» films we watch all over again.Indiana Jones and the temple of the Cristal skull begins as an attempt to integrate these values onto a new generation, i saw it in the form of cg sets, blue screen shots, cg creatures (prairie dogs) and I'm talking just about the first act of the film. Its a visual extravaganza, more in the terms of what Lucas got us us to than Spielberg himself. As for the direction i can still recognize the Spielberg parts, but not as crude, clean and dirty like they were before. It was like watching something that was blurred with the cg brush of the very obsessed George Lucas. (and they promissed not to overuse the C.G.) One thing i state as a thumbs up was the attempt of making this a real «Republic Serial», the shots, the pacing and even the characters contribute to that, even more than the other Indy Films.Everything is involved in a nostalgic dome, for me was like reunite an old friend, it was like talking about the old stories, but after a while i saw that there wasn't much more to talk about. Harrison Ford ruled and shows us that he still got it, as for the other cast members are solid, i really miss some development in both the ray Winston and Cate Blanchet part. The Script is developed as a cliffhanger, it was written as bulletproof, inserting nostalgic moments with the artistry of the great Michael Kahn editing. I've noticed also more resemblances to the script of some Indiana Jones Videogames, «Fate of Atlantis» seemed a great influence in this film.It was not the story that troubled me, it was not the acting either, but there was a tendency to exaggerate, to carry Indy onto the Matrix generation, with a lot of impossible «near death» sequences, the waterfall sequence is one of the most surreal moments iv'e saw in my life! as for a scene where Mutt Williams swings with small monkeys like a Disney Tarzan, or worse, like a Scary movie gag...But i guess it all comes together in the end, you forgive Indiana Jones, he is like that absent friend you d love to reunite. The Matrix generation will love this film, the others who grew up with the character i guess will have to forgive Indy and follow him for his latest adventure!In the over hall i believe if they could keep the film simple it would be a more consistent movie.

1196,scarlettudor,Archaeological Accuracy ~ Not Bad! Shia LeBoeuf ~ ditto!,6,13 June 2008,"I had heard scholarly types were up in arms about inaccuracies in this film. I don't expect an action movie to be the equivalent of a college course. It's entertainment! If it educates you a little, too, so much the better.I was lucky enough to visit Peru last year and there were definitely some familiar aspects to the movie. The Nazca Lines are near the town of Ici, however. That's where you fly out to see the lines from the air. The little airport there is about as small and dusty as that shown in the film, too.One of the languages that Indy spouted was Quechua, which is the native Indian language in Peru. It was correctly labeled, although I have no idea if the words spoken were actually that language.In the museums there are many examples of the long-headed skulls that were shown in the movie. Children did have their heads shaped from an early age, in certain tribes hundreds of years ago. Skulls are on display in the museums and they are quite startling. Hoping it's not against the rules, here's a link to a picture http://travel.webshots.com/photo/2386369520050392826FtmyGU Ancient native peoples did use mummification, but they weren't in little 'pods,' as the movie showed the Conquisidors. They were actually in big fabric sacks. There are thousands of such mummies in Peru and they can be seen in museums everywhere. Too bad they didn't use an accurate mock-up of the sacks. Here's a picture of a typical Paracas Indian mummy, out of the sack. http://travel.webshots.com/photo/2133734180050392826vrdhoF The scenes of the ancient Incas attacking Indy and friends were not very interesting to me. However, the way Indy's old friend, Oxley, was dressed looked like a Quechua medicine man to me.http://travel.webshots.com/photo/2822916560050392826pCPmai Finally, I just wanted to comment on young Shia LaBoeuf as Indy's unexpected son. I thought he added a lot to the movie, as did the return of Indy's true love, Marion. I tried to find some information on Shia, like what is the ethnicity of his first name. His French last name reminds me of the old Wendy's commercial, ""Where's the beef?"" LOL! In this case, he looks like beefcake in the making, to me. He looks like a young Russell Crowe, which is certainly not a bad thing.I enjoyed the movie, but prefer more character development than action movies like this typically have.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1197,Aggelos_Kreouzis,Indy is Ice Cream Cone,8,3 March 2017,"Am I the biggest Indy fan? Sure, we all are. What best character for a child to love. I consider him better that any Star Wars persona, cause he is down to earth. Even when he jumps in the air. We watched Raiders at what age? 8? What an experience. What a plot. Lucas and Spielberg at their finest. And the special effects! And the music!Then Temple of Doom came. Are we 12? About so. And it was fine and quite gore and we didn't understand the Hindi myths so it was enjoyable. Indy jumping around again. And just as we were about to lose innocence, comes Last Crusade, and the plot is amazing, and the jokes hilarious, and Sean Connery is there, cracking us up and what a genius ending!!!!So as we enter the Video Game universe spending some serious time on that 80286 and adventure games rock, Fate of Atlantis comes and WE can make Indy jump again. The plot is 100% solid and the music and the jokes and the action is there. See how this was going? What a timing. Everything came perfect. Like a 4 course meal, each plate served the moment you were hungry again. But since the cooks are there, you don't want the meal to finish; you're just waiting for the next course, or at least for fine dessert. So since then, nothing. How many movies did we watch since? 1,000 probably. Nowadays how much can a movie surprise you? It's a bit sad actually. And CGI? I cannot tell the difference anymore. Sorry. X- Files was good. (I will use this last part later) So we grew up, that's always both bad and good. It's 2008 and Indy is back. How old were you? I was 30. How to see Indy with the same eyes? You just can't. You're not a child any more. Get over it. You want to be. I feel like I had a smaller disappointment than others. I liked the movie. I think the reason was that the previous evening I sat home, switched off the lights and watched Raiders full, no interruptions, phones, or popcorn. Felt a bit like 10 again. Remembered the feelings. And I hit the 6pm feature the next day, weekday, so we are like 10 people in the theater; was quite focused. So quickly I'm getting chills down the spine seeing the fedora hat and that the old warehouse was Area 51. And Indy looking old, it's OK, now plot is in the 50's; so he just grew up, like I did, they are not faking him to be 30, I like that. And he's jumping around again and yes, I like the opening scene as always. Damn, I thought that was closer; hilarious, Indy being sarcastic on himself. And look, the 50's FBI agents from the X Files are there and Roswell is mentioned; would Indy be involved in Rosswell? Of course. And he survived the nuclear blast. Hmm am I still 10? No, but OK, I'll buy it. I'm still not buying how he didn't break every bone in his body spinning at 150kmh (he outran that speeding car, remember?) But it was something I never saw before, so it's original; I think I'd buy it better if the fridge was in the basement and he was salvaged from the ruins. But I don't want to see aliens in an Indy movie; even if I was 10. If only they were an innuendo throughout and left us with question marks at the end. You know, like the X Files. And nobody likes Shia, sorry. And why in an Indy movie, where historical facts should be given attention, am I shown an image of Pizarro, being told this is Orellana? No one will notice? Was the plot thin? YES! Like Doom, only I'm not 12 anymore. I don't mind that much, what I do mind is, after so many years was this really the best they could come up with? Why is CGI horrible? I honestly do not understand. I mean, this is Steven Spielberg and George Lucas; they don't pass through Movie Special Effects History; they ARE history ;) Didn't they see the result? It looked fake. Even if I was 10, I would say fake. Raiders' ghosts do not look fake even today. So I am thinking; this is just something made without attention. Probably JUST for money. Had it more attention would it be OK? No. We were waiting too long, not hungry like kids any more. What if, this exact same plot, cgi, came then, around 1995- 1996; you know, around our 20s, X-Files era. Could we see it differently? I think so. Would we like it more? Yes. But if we didn't, we wouldn't mind that much. Because we were still hungry as young. KOTCS is a machine vanilla ice cream cone after a superb 4 course meal.I don't have ice cream cone for dessert any more. Especially at fine dining. I'm having cheesecake with caramel decorations; or just a double espresso. But when I DO have ice cream cone, I REALLY enjoy it because it reminds me how it was when I was a kid. And if you are seriously in your 30's, thoroughly analyzing why you don't like ice cream cone any more, you're just stupid. I think this last part resolves my only true concern, why was the movie a poor dessert: When Steven, Ms. Kennedy, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Koepp and Harrison read this script, and their first thought was ""Fans will not like it"" I think their second thought was, ""Indy is like ice cream cone, who cares if it is good or not, everyone will eat it"".",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1198,SlickRobie,Don't waste your money - watch the old movies again,1,23 May 2008,"Saw this yesterday paying top dollar for the privilege. Although I resisted the urge to walk out midway, there were several times I felt I should actually go & spend my time on something better.I expected a lot from Spielberg and Ford. You realise, I didn't mention Lucas since he totally screws up the movies he makes (apart from the first Star Wars). It looks as if Lucas has had lot more say for this movie compared to previous IJ movies. This is actually the most boring movie Spielberg has made so far. If I didn't know it then I never would have guessed this was directed by Spielberg - come to think of it may well have been 'directed' by Lucas. Also, I don't know what they have done with cinematography but it all looks fake - as if it was done on a sound stage. There is a lot of CGI and it clearly looks fake.Firstly, I wonder why Ford took on this movie after complaining about getting the right script, yaada, yaada, yaada. Secondly, he looks so old and past caring. I felt really sorry looking at him. He just didn't have the sense of energy when doing things. All the things that happened where telegraphed miles ahead. No excitement to the action scenes. It seems people are there just to make money.Mark my words, this will make ton of money first week but will drop out pretty quickly as the word of mouth reaches everyone (similar to Ghost Rider, etc).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1200,bigmonster82,Eh,5,24 May 2008,"There are many things to appreciate in this movie. The addition of certain characters, a couple scenes that were subtle throwbacks to the originals, and just seeing Indy again, all made it worth going to the theater. That said, it really isn't a very good film. It is so ridiculously flawed in so many ways, I find it hard to believe that people are saying it is par for the course as an Indiana Jones film. While it is very much in the spirit of the original films, it is far inferior in just about every way. Honestly, Shia LeBouf is one of the best parts of the movie. He looks and sounds like he belongs in this kind of movie, and I came away very impressed with his performance. Cate Blanchett is an interesting, if somewhat useless villainess. It was cool seeing Karen Allen again, but thats about where the positive aspects of her performance end. She is given very little to do, and when she is asked to contribute, it feels phoned in. Ray Winstone's performance and character are both pathetic. Poorly conceived, poorly written, poorly executed. I'm sorry, but he just isn't a very strong actor. Jim Broadbent is wasted, for the most part. Lastly, the great Harrison Ford. There are moments in the film where that old Indy light shines behind his eyes. There are moments where our unrequited love for this man feels truly justified. But for about fifty percent of the movie...I just wasn't buying it. Something about his has changed, and not just his age. There's something that he had so naturally in the originals that just felt forced in this one. It didn't help that the script was, for the most part, absolutely horrendous. I haven't read the series of drafts that have been passed on by the Ford/Spielberg/Lucas trifecta, but I believe Moriarty at AICN has, and he said that he could identify various aspects of the scripts that had been patched together. I got the exact same impression. It felt like a patchwork of stories that the filmmakers attempted to reconcile with one another with very little success. The story just isn't cohesive. Honestly, the story problems stood out more than anything else, and for a movie that they waited nineteen years to make, they really could have done better. Much better. Certain elements of the story are absolutely ludicrous. I realize this is true to a certain degree with the three original films as well, but this one takes it to a whole different level. When Spielberg said that this movie was essentially CGI-free, he lied. Big time. I think the direction in certain scenes is phenomenal, and Spielberg's skill at composing action sequences in particular is really astonishing. The majority of the action set-pieces were very entertaining, but everything in between was weak. On the human level, he really got very little from his principal actors. However, I place most of the blame for the movie's failure squarely on the shoulders of George Lucas. As the man who essentially conceived the story, he is most responsible for the largest flaws, which were primarily story flaws. Not to mention that his ham-fisted influence on certain scenes is so blatantly obvious, I'm surprised he didn't get a co-director credit. I realize it may be unfair of me to place most of the blame on Lucas, but seriously, the man hasn't made a good film in thirty years. Everything he's done in the last decade has been undeniably abominable, and, lets be honest, it wouldn't be the first time he inadvertently tarnished the reputation of a great franchise he was responsible for creating. I don't want to venture too deep into spoiler territory, but, in my opinion, the best parts of the film were those that took place in real locations, and relied on real stunts and creative art design to be successful. The opening scene with the kids in the car was fantastic, and may just be my favorite part of the movie. The motorcycle chase was great. The chase scene in the jungle was pretty cool. But anything that took place in a cobwebby temple or an ancient tomb just seemed kind of lame. There was something very fake about their design, and I couldn't get past it. Overall, its worth going to see in the theater. My review may sound harsh, but I really did enjoy most of the film. I am relatively satisfied, and they certainly didn't screw up Indy like they did Star Wars. My biggest complaint is that it could have been much, much better. There is a wealth of story possibilities in the Indiana Jones universe, and they chose one that just wasn't very interesting. A pretty good film that doesn't hold a candle to any of the three originals.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1201,bengood4000,Watched a 00:05 on May the 22nd!,9,22 May 2008,"At 5 past midnight I sat down in a packed cinema to watch Indy IV (including people dedicated enough to dress up)and the verdict, it is a truly terrific film. There will be better films this year I'm sure but they will be hard pressed to provide anywhere near as much entertainment as Indy IV does. The action was thrilling, the acting and characterisation was top notch. If you loved the first three then you will love this one. It may not quite stand up to Raiders of the lost Arc but then again what in the last 27 years has!? If you want to be entertained then I would highly recommend this film to you whomever you are. Rejoice, the king of adventure has returned and the pretenders have been put in their place!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1202,milanbaros_948,'Not as easy as it used to be',4,24 May 2008,"Those few words, heard in most of the trailers and very early in the film seem to be a motto not only for Indiana Jones, but Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas as well. The original trilogy, even the inferior 'Temple of Doom', were all excellent popcorn entertainment. Even at its darkest the franchise was always fun. The latest movie, however, struggles to escape its silly moments.The first problem is the script, it clangs and clatters with overly nostalgic sentiment and tons of references to other movies. This is all very well if it doesn't infringe on the action, but, in this latest film it feels like watching a Spielberg/Lucas memoir rather than an actual movie. Did George Lucas invent Star Wars? Well, really well done George but I already knew that and I didn't need Harrison FOrd to turn into Han Solo halfway through the movie and sigh, 'I have a bad feeling about this'. The same film also references 'The Untouchables', 'The Wild One', the obligatory references to the past Indiana 'best bits' and most of the fifties parts feel like we've walked into Lucas's American Graffiti.The film is so self-congratulating it was hard to concentrate on the actual narrative. Which was ludicrous, going in directions Indie would never have dreamt of going in the past. The acting is all up to scratch although most of them are misused or pointless...ahem, Karen Allen. It also features an ending no true Indie fan could ever be happy with, collating all those negative feelings as the credits roll.Spielberg is a talented director but he cannot keep making these kinds of movies. He has matured, as all directors do, and his 'serious' films seem to get more and more assured. But he is not a movie brat anymore, he has not been able to deliver with a blockbuster of this kind since Jurassic Park and he should stick to what he is now best at, serious movies for mature audiences. Leave the blockbusters to the new brats.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1203,rockeymallavia,Should have stopped with 3.,4,22 May 2008,"Please note my rating. I have given this movie 4 stars out of 10, since it is not even half the movie that the last movie of the trilogy (The Last Crusade) was. Now, on to my review.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal skull sees Harrison Ford taking up the role of the titular character once again, this time in 1957 in the middle of the US/Soviet Cold War. The bad guys this time are Commies, and although they are diabolical, they lack the pure hate-ability of the Nazis. Anyway, the movie depicts Indiana Jones racing against the Soviets to return a crystal skull to its resting place, which will unlock the lost city of El Dorado. Along the way the nature of the crystal skull and its apparent ties to the supernatural are revealed.Overall, I can't fault the movie entirely. The action sequences are still top notch, and although there is CGI, the movie doesn't rely on it like most of today's blockbusters. The on-screen chemistry between Harrison Ford and Shia LeBouf was far more cohesive and fun to watch than I thought it would be. And yes, there are some memorable one-liners and scenes in the vein of what the previous films offered.Now, on to the films many flaws. There's one common source to these problems: George Lucas. As some people have probably read, George Lucas's premise for the fourth installment of this series involved Indiana Jones fighting the Martians (seriously). While the film is certainly winds up being more subtle than that, the extra-terrestrial aspect was not necessary at all. Lucas has lost his mind, and the script ultimately bends to his self-indulgent, I'm-George-Lucas-I-can-do-anything whims. If this man could have been shut out of the creative process, I'm sure I'd be dialing in an 8 or a 9 for this movie instead of a 4.Overall, yes, I'm probably being harsh on this movie because of the 3 that preceded it. If this had been the first in the franchise, would I have hated it? Who knows. But consider this. The thing I couldn't stand about this movie was how over the top and ridiculous it was. That's right. After watching a movie in which the Ark of the Covenant melts Nazis, Indian people eat chilled monkey brain, and a catacombs is found underneath an Italian library, this manages to somehow exceed all those others in terms of ridiculousness.

1205,mmcafeend,"Originally ""The Saucermen From Mars",7,30 May 2008,"Indiana Jones & the Kingdom Of the Crystal Skull returns with a punch of science fiction craziness. It brings back the old original plot of a classic but brings it to Caddyshack feel, then a haunted house, then back to a good movie till the end when it gets to a weird alien saucer thing. I personally don't think that it should've been made at Harrison Ford's age, but on another part,it kept me entertained for the whole movie and includes a very good cast including Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchet, Shia LaBeouf, & Karen Allen. The effects are amazing along with the acting and in the end, is a good movie. Overall, I would give this movie a seven star rating of ten. The highlight of the movie is a scene that has to do with Amazon predators. Just to highlight the series, I will rate the whole series now.(all on a ten star scale) Part 1: 9 stars, part 2: 8 stars(little bit worse than part 3), part 3: 8 stars, part 4: 7 stars...part 4 was good, but not great and the worst of the series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1207,rayovac,I must have seen a different movie!,7,26 May 2008,"First, the disclaimers: 1 - I am (still) and have been an Indiana Jones fan since I was a boy (I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark when I was about 8).2 - Prior to viewing the film last night, I had read a number of reviews (including Roger Ebert's excellent review of the film).3 - I went in with modest expectations.OK - what struck me about the film was in how many ways I completely disagreed with a majority of reviewers (both those who disliked it *and* those who enjoyed it). It seemed that everything that everyone complained about wasn't ""all that bad"" and that those who enjoyed it seemed oblivious to some obvious problems with the film.My main (and only) real complaint with the film is either the acting or the editing (most film makers will tell you that often the two are one and the same). During the initial sequence and leading up to the turn to South America, the film suffers from what I can only explain as ""bad takes"" making it into the final cut. Anyone who has seen the takes that *don't* make it into films, will tell you that it is usually because the acting is ""flat"" or seems more like ""line delivery"" as opposed to ""acting"". Proper editing and selection of takes can reduce this, but this is not the case in this film (again, until the action starts in South America). Even Harrison Ford (who, *does* act his age - another point that I seem to be the only one who sees) who tries hard seems to be in rehearsal as opposed to the final take. Now, again, editing can salvage this - but it didn't. Naturally, though, when dialog isn't being delivered (action sequences), everything works well (even prior to the South - American second and third acts). Especially fun are the action sets in the beginning sequence and the motorcycle chase.Once the movie moves to South America (and Karen Allen and John Hurt enter the movie), the acting / editing become much better and the film really hits stride - it gets *great*! Finally, we're back into an Indy movie! The remaining action sequences, the set pieces, the acting, the emotional subtext (which is palpable), and the story (yes, the story is excellent) are simply a joy to watch. Naturally, we need to suspend all disbelief (duh - it's an Indiana Jones film!), but the pace is quick and it is a lot of fun. The humor is ""on"" and we are rewarded with a great climax and epilogue! In terms of performances, Shia LeBeouf and Allen shine, Ford and Hurt are excellent (again - this is all in the second and third acts), and the supporting cast (including Cate Blanchett) are all very serviceable. The CGI is generally seamless and not ""on display"" (for the most part). I also found that the ""ultimate source"" of the crystal skulls (which is telegraphed from the start of the film) is neither out of place nor unfamiliar with a film series that deals equally with mystical and magical concepts easily.The cinematography is excellent, John Williams (as usual) delivers a wonderful score, and the production values are what we would expect.A last word about the potential for ""future films"" - the ending really seems to leave the door open (read: ""wide open"") for future films. Given the strength of Shia LeBeouf's performance (and the story line between him and Indy), it would be exciting to see him leading (perhaps with Ford playing a supporting role ala Sean Connery) a new film in the series - he really does pull his own *that* well.Whatever you do, do *not* go into the film with any expectations (good or bad) and walk out with your own ideas. Whatever you feel, you'll likely agree that this is a 'not to miss"" episode in the series.In terms of ""where in the series"" does this one stack up? I don't know - Indy is so much older that it almost seems like a ""new"" series. Still, if you pushed me into a corner, I would say that it is likely a tie for the second best in the series (perhaps it falls slightly behind The Last Crusade). For me (someone who still loved Temple of Doom), this is saying a *lot*! Enjoy!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I wasn't sure what to expect, so my senses were heightened throughout the entire film. I'd say that Indiana Jones 4 was somewhat of a letdown...it was a good action/adventure movie, but not up to par with the rest of the series. Harrison Ford still has it, and it was truly fascinating to see how he handled the ""much older, much wiser"" idea and ran with it. I was very impressed with Shia LaBoeuf, and seeing the return of other familiar characters was a pleasure. Lucas' dialogue was choppy and unrealistic at times, but he did have some glorious one-liners in there. Spielberg's direction was quite good, but the rest of the movie was disappointing in the sense that Indiana Jones 4 wasn't as good as I expected it would be. I think the general consensus is that they should stop where they're at, call it a good run, and hang up the fedora.

In 4wks, it'll be off the radar (unless the theaters have contracted to run it longer in which case they'll be losing money). Look for the DVD in 3mos.I will say that I'm shocked at the amount of positive reviews. I was in a theater of 200+ people with free food and cocktails all night. C'mon...free meal and liquor? Alas, still, I didn't hear one person...not one!...say anything good about the movie. Granted I didn't speak to each and everyone. But of the 50+ people I spoke with all stated they thought the movie ranged from 'it was okay' to 'awful..terrible'.Certainly no where near as good as some of the people are posting here.

I find myself fortunate that I can still go to a movie and enjoy it, and not look for all the flaws in it that I couldn't see when I was a 10 year old because I was too young and stupid.Go and see this movie. It's made by old pros and most of it is entertaining. There weren't many major problems with the movie, and I liked the alien theme of it that keeps in time with the era's mindset about Roswell and U.F.O speculation - something that obviously effected Spielberg's film career - whilst being up to date with current theories of trans dimensional travel (this is actually something that is currently being scientifically tested if you look it up).A great effort, a great cast, good action and an interesting story for the Indy series.So please haters, go and sort your lives out. Nobody cares if you can't take it, and that your original 3 films have now been ruined, and you can't watch them the same way anymore (just like your original Star Wars trilogy).

Lucas, Spielberg, Ford, et al should feel ashamed. The quality of the original trilogy lay (even in the blip that was the second film) in neat plotting and editing, a witty script and character chemistry. This instalment is lacking in each of those. An Indiana Jones film should be sufficiently tight that plot holes should be irrelevant until after the final reel has played; in 'the Crystal Skull' the plot holes appear as soon as they are shown. There is ghastly dialogue between Ford and LaBouef and John Hurt must feel embarrassed. Even the 'baddies' lack sharpness. The quality of 'Raiders' and 'The Last Crusade' lie in part on their trading on objects which have deep and familiar cultural significance; this crystal skull business is both comedically contrived and weightless. George Lucas, who must be given credit for conceiving Indy in the first place, is most deeply to blame - his clumsy fingerprints lie all over this film, from dodgy and unnecessary cgi to a lumpen script.

1217,greedo82,George Lucas should be ashamed,4,7 June 2008,"George Lucas has done it again. I saw some things in the new Indy-movie that I saw in the Star Wars movies 1-3. George Lucas must have lost his head somewhere in space. It's sad to see. I agree to some point when people say that there were cheesy comments and lines even in the old Indy-movies. Sure, there was. BUT NEVER this much. It also seems to me that Lucas and Spielburg has jumped on the bandwagon that leads to the ""modern day"" movies where you have to incorporate so much more in a two-hour-movie than you had to 20-30 years ago. Was I watching a violent action movie or was it an adventure of Indiana Jones? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an action movie that doesn't leave any time for thought. Some where in all that action they forgot to put in a solid plot that builds up the excitement. In the first Indy-film the mystery surrounding The Lost Ark got built up during the whole film, this was not the case with Crystal Skull. Everything seemed to happen at once. Some lines in Crystal Skull is so much like some lines in Lucas recent Star Wars movies that I could swear he put them there. Why did Indy have to say at the end that the treasure of this ""Skull society"" was knowledge. We already got that one Lucas!! Why explain it. Where is the mystery when you constantly explain everything. Just like Lucas did in Phantom Menace when he had to explain what the force was.

This movie attempts to do the same, but completely misses the mark because it attempts to use ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor, a type of humor which implies that something is not to be taken seriously. And thus, while it can be used with action films, it doesn't work well with drama or suspense, and hence it doesn't work well in this movie. The first three films worked well because the viewer could lose themselves in the action and suspense. but you can't lose yourself in something which always reminds you that...it's just a joke.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Everything from cars to buildings to clothes and even soda bottles. Spielberg has become a master of recreating 60s America. He did it first with Catch Me If You Can, and now this.Speaking of Catch Me..., noticed one background music score that is very similar to that in this film. It's a mysterious sounding flute based score.Wouldn't be surprised if the score was indeed reused, since the music director is the same for both movies (John Williams).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

All people have been saying is how pathetic the fourth Indiana Jones movie is. It really isn't that bad. I saw it at midnight like lots of other die-hards...and i thought it sucked. Then I saw it one week later, after a week of reflecting on my first viewing, and here's the summary I can give after seeing it the second time.It isn't that bad. The plot is fun, and is just as believable as the heart-ripping TOD, ark with spirits that light Nazis on fire ROLA, and cup that keeps knight alive for 700 years LC...however the execution of the plot and storyline is terrible. I dunno where George Lucas was going with some of the dialogue...and his execution of some fairly decent, enjoyable, and entertaining ideas comes up short, or is too heavily animated, in many instances.Harrison Ford is just like he was in the other films; an entertainer, a hero, a comedian...in my opinion just seeing him put the hat back on was worth the $7.50. Shia LeBauf really isn't that bad, and he plays his role well. If there's a fifth film, I'd welcome a LeBauf/Ford partnership again. It was Karen Allen that really got to me. I loved her in ROLA, but it seems like its been, truly, 19 years since she's been in a movie, her acting is that bad. The villains in the film match up to any from the previous films. And Mac is just as entertaining a sidekick as Brody.My problem, besides the execution of the plot, comes down to a few basic cheesy scenes that almost ruin the movie. if you've seen it, as follows (SPOILERS) 1. the monkeys in the jungle scene with shia swinging like tarzan 2. the following scene where the monkeys actually attack the russians 3. Karen Allen driving a car off of a cliff, where it gently lands on..a tree, and drops calmly into the water 4. while i'm an alien believer, the portrayal of the aliens and the ship especially came off as jokes to most viewers 5. ...the fridge scene...c'mon you knew it was coming (only props to this because later when Indy says ""i just survived a nuclear explosion"", it's kinda bad ass)Overall I'd put it ahead of Temple of Doom, thought it doesn't matter how many times i see it, it will never equal Raiders or Last Crusade. Go see it though. and if you hate it the first time, wait a bit and give it one more time. if you still hate it...pretend there's still only three.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1221,le_wubster,"Indy-'Light'. Not bad, but somewhat lacking for the old fans.",6,29 May 2008,"The Indiana Jones trilogy always have been some of my favorite movies. Of course I got excited when I heard that a new one was being made. Well aware that high expectations are real big movie-enjoyment killers, I tried not too expect too much. But.. I still had secretly hoped for that old fashioned movie-magnificence.Then the trailer arrived. I more or less knew what to expect after that. An okay movie, somewhat lacking the Indy feel and quality. And that's exactly what we got.The good: Cinematography, editing, lighting, set pieces, costumes; mostly top stuff. Likable actors. Plot idea alright. Some nice action moments. A few moments of Indy-nostalgia ('ta-tata- taaaa!'). The first 30-40 minutes were really promising.The bad: Basically, this is Indy-'light' - Indy for kids. Gone are most of the scary stuff, the violence, the shock-moments, truly intimidating bad guys. And most things are too goofy/unbelievable. I know, the old movies were not exactly hyper-realistic either, but here everything's so crazy there's hardly any sense of danger to our heroes, like there was in the past.And why is Marion smiling all the time? Facelift gone wrong or something? Sorry, Karen Allen, but i feel there's been some bad actor direction here and there and you're the biggest victim. About that, some of the dialog/acting/direction, especially in scenes with emotion, seemed off, and what could have been charming, empathy-inducing scenes, didn't really come across. Perhaps too much focus on the humor side of things again?Last nitpick: one of my pet peeves - CGI: Too much, and often too fake. It seems to be a sign of the times. I recall a few scenes that really crossed into Jackson's 'King Kong' territory of over-the-top cgi-fakeness. That's not what they promised earlier...Overall: Worth watching. Better than a lot of average action/adventure movies we've seen lately. Too bad it didn't reach greatness. Almost all of the Indy-ingredients are there, but there not on the same level as before. This Indy movie is last in line, but that's still on top of most other action/adventure stuff.

But if you're the kind of person who accepts things for what they are, then you'll enjoy this film.To say this installment of Indiana Jones is nostalgic would be the understatement of the year. It yearns for so many days gone by, be they the time period the movie fastidiously recreates, the days of the genre the movie recalls, or the heyday of the series itself, that it's hard to tell what the priority was for its makers. But this in itself isn't a bad thing - it's just the given you must accept going into this film. That being its terms, its hard not to enjoy going along for the ride down what is self-admittedly Memory Lane, given how skillfully it is crafted.It does what it sets out to do admirably: A more proper sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark, the series has never had, and ultimately it serves as a fitting end to a once and still entertaining story.

Its the year 2008 and you have to expect CGi effects in any high budget film. Anybody who grew up watching Indiana Jones will probably rant that this movie was horrible in comparison but for the newer generation they think this movie is simply great. I went to see it with my nephews 15 and 18 years of age and they loved it. I thought it was a decent movie and worth watching, a lot of action, sometimes exaggerated but funny. There is some scenes you might think how is that even possible , some elements from the other Indiana Jones movies are non existent, you won't get that same feeling you got when you were watching the previous Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford is a lot older but still kicks butt. It's an overall good film to watch.

1224,vitalessenc3,What a massive disappointment! (Spoilers included),1,22 May 2008,"First off, let me say that I have always been a Harrison Ford fan and I adored the original Indiana Jones films.When I first heard about Harrison Ford signing on to do another film, I went from elation to trepidation in seconds because I realized that it would be a challenge for the new movie to capture the same feeling as the previous ones.When I ended up seeing it earlier today, I went in with lower expectations because I felt that would guarantee me a positive viewing experience since it would be unlikely that I would be let down.I was let down.Ford looked pretty good. But that was certainly not enough to carry a movie.Shia's character was annoying and off-putting and I cannot believe that with all the actors in Hollywood that he was cast as the son of Indy and Marion. Perhaps they wanted to capitalize on his face recognition from his role in ""Transformers"" or they legitimately thought he fit the bill but I have to disagree.Overall, my greatest problem with the film was that I was incapable of suspending my disbelief enough to sink into Indy's world and thoroughly enjoy it (as I would have liked to).Here is a list of the scenes that irked me the most:Indy surviving the blast at the nuclear test site by hiding in the nicely-labeled lead-lined fridge which is blown through the air by the blast and yet he is basically fine after the clean upthe Tarzan-esquire scene of swinging on the vines and catching up with the car chase the straddling of two vehicles involved in a chase (and the hot-potato game with the crystal skull) and getting one's crotch smacked by greenery going over 3 waterfalls and all the passengers managed to stay aboard their land/sea vehicle until the final waterfalla student asking Indy a question after he has slid under a table in the library with a motorcycle (too cutesy and trying for levity) the extended jungle chase and all the fighting, swapping vehicles and the back and forth with the skull... it went on too long. freaking aliens? from another dimension? WTF?!?!?!This movie lacked a cohesive and intelligent plot as well as well-drawn out characters. Indy was almost a parody of himself. Marion was an after-thought and Irina was a stereotypical bad guy.Two thumbs down for this one.Though, maybe after reading this -- other potential viewers will have lowered their expectations enough to eventually eke a modicum of enjoyment out of it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1225,magicwings,George Lucas and the Other Trilogy He Shouldn't Have Returned,5,23 May 2008,"There are so many like me who grew up watching the magic of Indiana Jones, those who saw the imagination seep through from just the opening scene of Raiders; who felt terrified watching a man's heart torn out in Temple of Doom; who dreamt of finding the right cup in the room of the holy grail in Crusade.There was always a presence in those films that made them so special. This was the presence of actors not making a film for money, but for enjoyment; of action sequences for the thrill instead of to boast CGI; of a wonderful, imaginative storyline that was solid throughout, meaning that you could pause the movie at any time and would know where they've been, where they're going, and exactly why. Unfortunately, most of this is missing in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.19 years have passed since Lucas and Spielberg made Harrison Ford don his famous hat, as has the time in the movie world - time has taken its toll and from the opening scene in Nevada we can see that. But that doesn't stop the action pouring in - in the first twenty minutes, an alien body is found, a hidden bunker is broken into, a rocket on rails is unleashed with Jones aboard and a nuclear bomb test blows Indy hundreds of yards into the air... in a fridge. As entertaining as it is, it is equally unbelievable - the trilogy drew you in and its imagination gave you belief, whereas here we just see comedy - but we only laugh at parts that aren't meant to be laughed at. In particular, the story, which explains that the skull of one of the aliens in the Roswell incident of 1947 is in fact a mythical skull from El Dorado.In fact, we barely see a storyline. It opens with huge action, followed by a gap filled with weak plot filling dialogue that makes no sense, and is preceded by more action. Blasting myths from Roswell to El Dorado and the Nazca Lines inbetween, it really lacks a solid storyline - something that the original trilogy prided itself on.The film isn't a BAD film, it's just not brilliant. The action sequences are overloaded with CGI almost as an excuse to do it, but nonetheless they are entertaining, particularly a jungle chase sequence in hummers, and the hugely visual-effects overblown finale.It just seems to go from the unbelievable to the even more unbelievable, whereas what us Indy lovers are really used to is a film that made us believe in what we weren't sure about.Now we ARE sure. It's definitely not real. The magic disappears the second the title theme stops from the opening of the film, and what we now need to hope is that they don't try and make a fourth.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

OK, there were minor differences in SOME moments, and i mean moments, that lasted like 5 seconds max. the music, was just a reworking of raiders (which is fine). the comedy, OK, except the tarzan swing, and the pine's hitting shia, were very funny (best one is, 'i've known you all my life, and you've never been this interesting!'). the vfx were great, some looked fake, but that's going with the 50's sci-fi look, which is fine. the story, rather weak, but honestly speaking, they all are rather weak storywise. the film itself, overall brilliant. personally, if i rank it, i will say the best is raiders (can't beat that), then Last crusade, then kingdom of the crystal skull and finally temple of doom. in simple words, to the people who don't like it, stop whining, just sit down and watch it. all the complaints are so minor, they can easily be overlooked. trust me, just watch it.nuff said.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1229,shoeone,They Should Have Quit While They Were Ahead,5,29 May 2008,"I just went to see the new Indiana Jones film yesterday evening, and I've got to say that I found the movie disappointing. I have been a big fan of the Indiana Jones series (including the Young Indiana Jones movies), and was wowed by Raiders of the Lost Ark when it came out three decades ago (eight stars). I was much less impressed by its unworthy sequel, Temple of Doom (four stars), and relieved by the excellent recovery of the series in Last Crusade (seven stars). My rating of five stars for the current, and hopefully last, iteration of the Indiana Jones saga is based on comparisons with its three illustrious predecessors. My bottom line: Lucas and Spielberg should have quite while they were ahead.One of the great selling points for ""Raiders"" and ""Crusade"" was that while there was plenty in each of these movies that was inexplicable, such as the powers of the Ark or the Grail, if you accepted the premise that the Ark or the Grail did exist and had magical powers, the rest of the story held together quite well. You could suspend disbelief a little bit and actually convince yourself that Harrison Ford/Indiana Jones really could get out of all those tight situations with nothing more than slightly mussed hair and a thoroughly dented fedora.Try that approach with ""Crystal Skull"" and you get nowhere. The Roswell/ El Dorado mythology is obscure and unbelievable, with enough plot holes to drive a pyramid-sized flying saucer through. Most comic books have a better thought-out plot. Worse still, the situations Indiana Jones gets into are clearly not survivable, unless he has morphed into a combination of Superman and the Hulk, and this detracts significantly from the entertainment value of the film. For example, surviving a nuclear blast by jumping into a nearby lead-lined refrigerator is a non-starter in every sense, as is the survival of all of our heroes through serial descents over three waterfalls. In addition, the marksmanship of AK-47 bearing Soviet troopers has to be truly execrable not to hit Indiana Jones or his compadres even once. This is not the 1930's, when one could reasonably evade a pistol shot here and there. An AK will cut through the jungle, and metal, like it wasn't there and kill everything in range. Indiana should have been killed a hundred times over by this alone,and, in any case, his old man running style didn't help me believe that he could somehow dodge all those bullets.I also have a few quibbles with the general storyline and casting choices. Nazis in the Middle East in the 1930s is one thing, but an entire Soviet army unit trundling around the Nevada desert and taking over the equivalent of Area 51 is not. It makes you think that those 1950s FBI guys who saw a commie under every bed might have been on to something. In addition, although Cate Blanchett is definitely nice to look at, she is miscast as the KGB villain of the piece. Her attempts at Russian were admirable, but still had my native-Russian speaking girlfriend in stitches. Somebody should have checked a Russian grammar text once in awhile.I also felt that the transition between the Area 51 warehouse and the nuclear test site was a bit inexplicable. What were those rogue Soviet soldiers driving around the test site, and what happened to the rest of them, including Cate Blanchett? The car chase scene through the University was sort of fun, but let's face it: there really would be no such thing as a race between a Harley and a Buick with portholes: it would be over in the first three seconds, with the Harley disappearing rapidly over the horizon. I also found myself scratching my head a little bit over the role played by Ray Winstone as the double/triple agent. His character was totally predictable and entirely superfluous. Shia LaBoeuf's performance as Indiana's long-lost son had some entertainment value, but, once again, I found that he seemed to be something of a fifth wheel at times, whether it was swinging through the jungle with a troupe of CGI monkeys, or engaging in thoroughly ridiculous swordplay with Cate Blanchett. It was great to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion Ravenwood, and the sparks that flew between her and Indiana were real and believable, although she did overact at times. I always like to see John Hurt, but his great talents as an actor were wasted in a role where he spent most of his time either spaced out or semi-comatose.One of my favorite scenes was at the beginning of the film, when Indy was in his office looking fondly at the pictures of his recently departed father (Sean Connery) and his professorial colleague (Denholm Elliott). Unfortunately, it reminded me of how good ""Last Crusade"" was in comparison to the current film. Connery must be thanking his lucky stars that he was written out of this ""Alien City of Gold"" fiasco. Lucas and Spielberg will probably make a ton of money on this movie, but it will do nothing for their reputations. They should have quit while they were ahead.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1230,AJ-41,What Kills Indy 4? - A Complete Lack of Storyline,1,27 May 2008,"I want to start off my review like a lot of others who's dreams of Indy were slashed - I love Indiana Jones and I was really wanted this film to cut the mustard, but alas it was not meant to be. We waited God knows how many years and what we finally receive at the end is a rather pathetic story involving aliens. Lucas and Spielberg shame on you! We trusted you and you let us down! This story is so bad I do feel like my devotion as a fan is being sorely tested. I paid $40 for tickets and popcorn and did not get a lot in return. I thought fan cries that Lucas go into retirement were kind of rough but I think this is the nail in the coffin. Lucas and I are parting ways. Special effects & stunts do not make up for a badly thought out plot and scant attention to dialog and story but I guess this message is lost on Hollywood today, even on those producers like Spielberg and Lucas who used to produce a movie worth going to the theater for. I have a theory with film sequels if the first one is good I will give the next film the shadow of a doubt and see the second but if the second sucks I am not so stupid as to go and see the third. I do not see myself buying this one on DVD, just like I did not buy the three star wars prequels on DVD. I will not be that badly abused. I only gave this film one star because I could give no less, I will have to console myself with the fact that this film did deserve a star for featuring Harrison Ford. At least he did a good job in this film and it was good to see him light up the screen once again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1231,csteiner,"Bad, bad movie",1,25 May 2008,"I really went in wanting to like this movie while at the same time keeping my expectations low so I would be pleasantly surprised, knowing it couldn't match Raiders of the Lost Ark and probably wouldn't match Last Crusade. Unfortunately even low expectations couldn't make this movie pleasant. Amazingly, within about an hour I was just wanting the thing to end. I didn't want to walk out because I wanted to see how it ended, but I wasn't enjoying it.The movie makes no sense and seems to be a bunch of unrelated scenes patched together. What has always given Indiana Jones movie their ""funness"" (in addition to decent story lines) is Harrison Ford, but he is not given much of an opportunity to shine. It seems that the character Mutt and some crazy old man actually accomplish more in the movie and Ford is just along for the ride--his contributions mostly limited to translating old languages and knowing where to stick a crystal skull to open a door. His only memorable and funny lines were in the trailers we'd already seen--almost all of which were extracted from the first 10 minutes of the movie.After I saw the first two movies back in the 80s I concluded that what made Raiders of the Lost Ark much better than Temple of Doom is that the object in the question was something real and of historic significance. The whole ""magic stones"" basis of Temple of Doom was not compelling so it was hard to get interested in the story so it was more of just a roller coaster ride than a good movie (not to mention the Short Round kid was nearly as annoying as Jar Jar Binks). It seemed that the creators realized that in Last Crusade and went back to an object that had some historic significance that people could allow themselves to believe had special powers and could be in awe of the object itself. And the storyline that lead them to the object was interesting and fun.In this newest Indiana Jones the creators seem to have forgotten what they learned in Temple of Doom. They based their story on an object that is almost universally accepted as being a 19th century fraud and twisted the storyline away from an adventure/archeology towards science fiction. Are we watching Indiana Jones or Buck Rogers? Even if they wanted to go in the direction they did, they could have done a *lot* more with the ""crystal skull"" and ""lost city in South America"" concept, mix in a sci-fi nuance, and still make it a fun adventure story in line with other Indiana Jones movies. I found the first ten minutes of Raiders (also in South America after a non-Christian artifact) far more interesting and compelling than 2 hours of Crystal Skull.I am a big fan of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade, and can forgive Spielberg and Lucas for Temple of Doom. But I don't see any way to forgive them for this installment. It was just plain bad, bad, bad. I don't know what they were thinking. Lucas/Spielberg/Ford all have enough money that I can't believe they just wanted a paycheck. If they honestly thought this movie was a good idea, they've really lost their way.If you're an Indiana Jones fan, you probably will hate this movie. It probably won't spoil the trilogy, though, because it's entirely forgettable.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1232,Not the Guy From Clerks,Indiana Jones and the Comedy of Errors,4,21 May 2008,"Visually, with Henry Jones Junior (he is rarely called ""Indiana"" or ""Indy"" in this film) swimming in his baggy grandpa pants and shocks of grey-white hair peeking out under an ever-crisp, rarely-dirty brown fedora, you really don't get the feeling that you're watching anything historic--but a few of the old John Williams refrains drive something primal bubbling to the surface of those of us who grew up idolizing Indy.The reason that the music is the first thing to be examined here, is that it's one of very few things that evoked that sort of reaction in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A movie fraught with missteps and an obvious misunderstanding of its own audience, it's exactly the type of summer blockbuster developed to make money at all costs: things blow up; there's aliens and Nazis--well, not Nazis so much as Russians with grey shirts and jackboots; an unnecessary youthful sidekick (to bring in the teenagers, you see); and a little something extra borrowed from Bryan Singer's abominable Superman Returns. To ascertain that you know it's a Spielberg picture, the Russians are never subtitled (see also: every Arab in Munich or about 90% of all Germans in any film except Schindler's List); this way, the ""evil"" characters can be thoroughly and literally dehumanized.The film oozes 1950s--Russian spies, nuclear testing, a screening of Howdy Doody and Dr. Jones on a sort of academic blacklist all take place in the first ten-or-so minutes of the picture (as doessad to say the high point of the film for mea cameo appearance by Neil Flynn, a friend of Ford's from The Fugitive who is best known for his portrayal of The Janitor on ABC sitcom Scrubs). The filmmakers have discussed at length how, while the earlier Jones films were an attempt to capture the magic of '30s and '40s adventure films with a contemporary feel, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will be a '50s-style action romp with some science-fiction sensibility thrown in for good measure (a questionable choice to start, as many of those films eventually ended up as Mystery Science Theater 3000 fodder). In an attempt to capture that feel, you have some campy dialogue, some stock characters and Shia LaBoeuf as Arthur Fonzerelli. There's a fairly generic soda fountain brawl, initiated by LaBoeuf and set to the tune of Shake, Rattle & Roll, which solidly plants this film in its era. This is an interesting artistic choice because in the previous Indy films, even with their date stamps, the adventures that took place were largely relatively timeless.The other aspect of the film that is bound to turn some heads--it already has, both in pre-screenings and on the Internet as eagle-eyed fans dissected the trailers--is the role that extra-terrestrials play in the picture. As in Spielberg's classic Close Encounters of the Third Kind, there is no dialogue, as such, shared between man and his visitors...but their presence is strong and pervasive, particularly in the second half of the film. Using Roswell as a jumping-off point, it is revealed that the good Dr. Jones has been used as a government agent in a variety of capacities since we last caught up with him--he is a Colonel in the Army, apparently, and also has worked with the CIA, MI6 and as a spy against the Russians in the time since Hitler autographed his father's diary for him in the early '40s.The adventure sequences in the picture are hit-or-miss; while some of the car chases and fight sequences are good, and a lot of the side jokes are on the mark, there are times (Marion is injured while driving, but mysteriously gets better) that it's hard to follow visually what's going on as they try to pack too many characters and subplots into a fast-moving sequence. Many of Harrison Ford's comic moments are on-target, but other diversionssuch a CGI-rendered prairie dogs and LaBoeuf's own private army of monkeysbring to mind some of the more artistically-questionable moments of Return of the Jedi and detract from the seriousness of consequences faced by our protagonists.Dr. Jones also doesn't get very much solo screen time. Henry himself has also become a little more cautious in his old age, while everyone around him seems to have become more like Indiana Jones. Mutt and Marion are decisive and powerful figures, while Indy often finds himself sitting on the back of a motorcycle or behind them in the car, shouting, ""No, don't do that! It's dangerous!"" As action heroes go, Indy has been turned into a great family man. In case a CIA agent of dubious allegiances, a kidnapped ex-girlfriend and her tagalong son weren't baggage enough, Indy spends most of the film carting around an octogenarian in a semi-catatonic state, who may be the ""key"" to finding the Lost City of Gold in the same way that his father was key to the recovery of the Holy Grail.Ultimately, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a film that, while not entirely bad, is nowhere near worthy of its lofty pedigree. As generic action films go, it may have provided some level of entertainment in the vein of National Treasure....It's the attachment of ""Indiana Jones"" to the title and the involvement of Harrison Ford, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg that raised expectations and standards to a level that none of those individualseach a shadow of his former selfcan meet any longer. It will doubtlessly open at #1 and secure the kind of critical and financial success that guarantee it a sequel if all involved want to make onethe question, really, is whether or not they should.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1233,cinemalad5,"Much to like, but much to gripe",7,28 June 2008,"There's much to like in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal"", but considering the series' pedigree, many fans will probably come away disappointed.The first 40 minutes of ""Skull"" are on par with the best moments of the series, but the story gets severely bogged down once the action moves to Peru, and the finale feels tired and by-the-numbers. The minor characters (Ray Winstone, John Hurt) seem silly and too broadly defined, and much of the action pushes the limits of believability -- even by ""Indy"" standards! Karen Allen's return as Marion Ravenwood was a wasted opportunity -- a far cry from the strong-willed, Howard Hawksian heroine who held her own in the original Raiders. Her relationship with Indy could have been the heart and soul of Crystal Skull (at least it was in the Frank Darabont draft), but instead it's criminally reduced to little more than a mere plot point. Instead the focus is on Indy's relationship with young biker/rebel ""Mutt"", played by Shia LaBeouf -- and this presents a significant problem. LaBeouf, for his part, acquits himself well in the role (those dismissing him as the Jar Jar Binks of the Indy series won't be justified), but the problem is that Mutt as a character is neither all that original, nor particularly interesting.On its own terms, Crystal Skull is a fun, entertaining movie to watch, but it never really captures the magic, awe, or grand sense of adventure that Raiders had -- and in spades.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1234,backrowreviews,"Well, it's better than ""Temple of Doom,"" anyway...",3,19 May 2008,"Arriving 19 years after the last Indy installment (""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade""), this going-through-the-motions slog proves that everyone involved should have quit while they were ahead. Star Harrison Ford is now a frequently grumpy old man who seems more annoyed than adventurous. Director Steven Spielberg seems to have forgotten how to make a story engaging, relying instead on audience goodwill and nostalgia (""Hey, look, he brought back Karen Allen, and she's still feisty!""). The special effects are much more lavish, but at the expense of making many of the stunts here look utterly unbelievable (not one but three plunges off skyscraper-high waterfalls) instead of only cartoonishly exaggerated.Also, the utterly illogical screenplay occasionally seems cobbled together from segments of spec scripts that may have made for better movies with different main characters. The opening bit on a nuclear test range, and the way Indy escapes annihilation there, seems to belong in a sequel to ""Crank."" A depressingly dour interrogation segment in which red-hunting FBI agents insult Indy and question the medals he won as a WW2 OSS officer feels like a heavy-handed, hammered-in allegory to today's Bush administration security state.Worst of all, this movie's idiotic ending is sci-fi stupidity that literally makes no sense whatsoever. It's impossible to reconstruct a set of circumstances that would make the plot work. For one thing, we're apparently dealing here with all-powerful god-like beings who somehow can't even manage to keep someone from stealing one of their friggin' heads.Shia LaBeouf isn't bad as Indy's is-he-or-isn't-he son. (Thankfully, that mystery is resolved sooner rather than later.) Cate Blanchett, in a pageboy black wig, pretty much plays things straight as a Russian military officer with a psychic bent that never amounts to anything. Allen is just kind of embarrassing as the 40-something version of her Marion Ravenwood character from the first Indy movie. Her banter with Ford here has a forced ""reunion show"" deliberateness instead of playfulness.As the credits rolled, I still was sort of waiting for an actual story to kick in. That's because this movie feels more like an elaborate video game with successive levels of difficulty, rather than the tale of the charming guy who is facing those challenges.Will it be possible for Spielberg and Ford to bounce back from this disappointing misfire with a fifth Indy flick, the way they recovered from the abysmally awful ""Temple of Doom"" with the likably lighthearted ""Last Crusade?""

1235,pat_batemanus,Grindhouse,2,21 May 2008,"The film starts out not very bad but it gets worse and worse as the ""story"" (a chaotic series of mostly nonsense events) goes on. This is a big budget ""B"" movie, it could have been screened together with Death Proof and Planet Terror... The film lacks the charm and humor of the original trilogy. Harrison Ford is old but this is not the biggest problem. I don't know what happened to Spielberg and Lucas, they just lost their magical touch. It would have been better not to make this film at all. I was very disappointed after the screening. I did not have great expectations before but it is a big underachievement from the Spielberg-Lucas duo who became their own iconoclasts with the new Star Wars and Indy movies.

1236,bugzsiegel04,Not worth the wait,1,22 May 2008,"This film ""jumps the shark"" in the first 15 minutes. Spielberg and Lucas seem to think that bigger is always better. Unfortunately, they are wrong. While Indy 4 contains many big action packed sequences, it is still a boring film. Worse than boring the film lacks heart. The main character has become someone else entirely, he is Henry Jones Jr. more than he is Indiana. People call him Henry, Jonesy, and even sweetie at one point. He rarely uses the whip after the first major sequence. In their insane quest to make all films ""family friendly"" Spielberg and Lucas give us cute prairie dogs and cgi communist hating monkeys. What they fail to deliver on is the promise of adventure made in the first (2nd and 3rd) Indiana films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1237,pinkpeach47,a little disappointed,6,23 May 2008,"Alright, this is my opinion and should be accepted as such. I saw this film last night at 8pm at Lincoln Square in NYC. The auditorium was packed and I was really happy that the crowd was lively and just as excited as I was.I'm a huge Indy fan as most of you are. Before I went to see Crystall Skull I watched all three of the originals in a row on DVD, I was so excited! I have to say though that after going into the film with some relative high expectations, but still an open mind I have to say that I was a little disappointed.I don't want to give away any plot points for people who haven't seen it, but I really expected something a little deeper and more like the originals. The original three films have him searching for something, but the truth behind what he's looking for has vast symbolic meaning and reflects the journey of Indy. I didn't think that the talisman in this film, the skull carried much weight in terms of meaning or even in the physical sense. It looked like it was made out of plastic and weighed as much as a beach ball.Indy has also entered a different kind of paranormal territory which was fine with me, but I had just wished that in the films climax, I could have just understood more what it meant and how it reflected the characters journey in the film. Like in The Last Crusade, the Holy grail is really the father and son finding each other.Harrison Ford was pretty good as Indy, not quite as exciting to watch him now, but you can see that his character has learned a lot since we've last seen him. The stunt work was also very impressive.Shia Laboeuf was good as he tends to be. I think he's a pretty solid actor and a fine addition to the series. He was also a good and interesting reflection of Indy.Cate Blanchett was probably my favorite performance in the film. She played a pretty interesting with some fun tricks up her sleeve.I was so happy to hear that Karen Allen was going to be in the film, but unfortunately she was waisted with very little to do. I also thought that they had a good opportunity to get into something really interesting with the gap in Indy and her's relationship, but it's all just sort of skipped over and rushed.John Hurt does nothing. Ray Whinstone does nothing. There's a lot of hit and miss in the movie. I have to say that I truly believed that there was going to be no CGI in this film. Like they were going to attempt to make in the style of the old ones. Guys, there's probably just as many computer graphics as The Phantom Menace! That was the most disappointing aspect for me. Cgi monkeys? All the critters were CG. What made the originals so special was that the danger felt real. Too much CGI takes that away. You can""t feel the texture.I gave this movie a 6/10. I thought it was a decent enough movie, but it failed to make me feel like i did when I saw the prior three movies. It was more like The Mummy. Some good acting and I laughed at the comic bits, but it is a totally new direction for Indy. I'm still glad I saw the film and I will probably see it again to see if my opinion changes, but it just didn't have that same gritty realistic energy of Raiders, Doom and Crusade.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1238,talbmail,Disappointed.,2,22 May 2008,"Let me start this review by stating clearly, that I have sinned. I have not watched a single Indy movie, so my review will be different from the reviews of people who grew up on the Indy series, and they really wanted to see the new movie in the series. I approached this film as a regular movie. Also, I don't usually write reviews, but here I really feel the need to write one, since this is one of the first times I didn't agree with an IDMB rating on a new movie.First, there's the plot. The writers are indeed very creative. Too creative in fact. To come up with such a twisted up story, one needs true talent. Or not. The plot was very confusing and very stupid, to say the plain truth. I won't go into details so as not to 'ruin' it for you. You can always read the synopsis. I found myself pondering in the middle of the movie: ""What the hell is going on now? Why are they falling now?"". You can blame the over-use of action, twisted plot and a VERY bad introduction to the plot for that.Next, there are the characters. Harrison Ford plays brilliantly and you can see that role suits him rather well. However, the rest of the characters (well, most of them) were very badly done. Shia LaBeouf was the worst choice for the role he played. He was really unconvincing during the movie and didn't convey any ideas he should have been supposed to convey during the movie. Then there's the conflict against the KGB. Apparently, the Russians were supposed to be actually frightening! Such a shame they weren't. And Cate Blanchett does a really bad Russian accent. Lay it off.Then there's the rather odd beginning, where Indy survives an atomic rocket attack, in a refrigerator! That didn't make any sense AT ALL. It was actually quite funny. And if we've touched on funny... That's the only reason this movie got 2 starts and not 0. The humor was OK and used properly, although a bit recycled. The main action scene was really unconvincing and too long. This made it tiring, although it had potential.Towards the end of the movie, I totally lost the plot. They were running around in temples, doing things I couldn't understand. And that's not too good, seeing as I was quite awake and interested.The latest Indiana Jones is a bad movie. I have no other words to pick. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The actors chosen were not suitable for the roles; some elements of the plot were recycled and some were too creative; then there's the excessive use of CGI. While I like CGI, this movie really overused it. Finding a scene without CGI is a rather tough task there. I share the pain of the Indy fans, who expected a good movie and got this soapy movie back. Whether you are an Indy fan or not, don't waste your time and money on this. You WILL be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1239,adambogoch92,Very good but not Amazing!!!~ The Truth to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull!,7,14 June 2008,"DO NOT GO IN THERE EXPECTING Another RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK!! OK so basically this is from the perspective of someone who doesn't dress up in fedoras and caring around a bull whip when going to the movie theater to see this movie unlike the majority of the writers of these incredibly negative reviews. So let's look at this in the perspective of an avid movie goer and watcher.First of all the number 1 rule before seeing this is DO NOT GO IN THERE EXPECTING Another CLASSIC RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK!!!!! This is a common mistake that is made. Instead of going in expecting another Academy Award winner like Raiders, go in like ""ok so this is another Indiana Jones film but completely different"", by thinking this you may see the many similarities I saw in the film, I have seen it three times actually.So the plot was sort of what I expected, no Raiders or Crusade but a very different film altogether. The first time I saw it the story was weak to me but before the second time I caught a documentary on TV based on Crystal Skulls, oh yes this is no mystery that Spielberg and Lucas made up...its a true myth. And yes the Crystal Skulls from Akatar or El Dorado have an unearthly connection. The alien connection didn't bother me whats so ever...in fact I sort of liked it.The cast: I can't tell you how happy to see Karen Allen again! She was great in Raiders and I thought the film would have been much worse without her. Allen was mostly in the second half of the film only but she was really great. Ford and Allen worked very well with each other again. Ray Winstone as Mac was fun, we sort of needed that type of character in the films. John Hurt had a major part as well and I thought he was very entertaining also. Cate Blanchet played Irina Spalko the main villain in the film and really, she did a good job supporting a sassy black bob, a sword, Russian accent(which did switch to British every time she said ""Dr. Jones"" which was like 5 or 6 times but whatever) and a devilish personalty. Shia although I am not a huge fan of his, was really good and he wasn't corny or boring whats so ever. In fact many think he stole the movie it's self. Jim Broadbent was also in it but a small part, he is a great actor and although he didn't fill the shoes of Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) he was very good. And of course Harrison Ford... HE IS STILL INDIANA JONES. I could see a lot of the facial expressions as the younger Indiana and the same acting skills, he was extremely good.OK so the movie did have faults! The big one for me was Shia swinging on vines with monkeys to eventually kick Blanchet in the face. OK Steven how about letting him run or fall or even jump from branches and climb in the trees and then swing maybe once to kick Cate Blanchet in the face...he isn't Spiderman! The waterfall seen was a bit much...no one would survive some of those falls. I could see maybe the two water falls for comedic purposes and then get on land and go down the third. The atomic bomb was a bit much, but it is based in the 1950's so it made sense. And aliens would have been on the list but after knowing it was a real legend and it had a strong alien connection and not to mention the Nasca lines (also not a myth for those how don't know). The special effects were mostly good, but the special effects of the trees and bushes etc during the sword fight between Blanchet and LeBouf was horrible, expect when shot from behind...weird but very true. When he was being hit in the crotch by those like bushes, the surrounding trees didn't look real and it looked to separated from the main picture...bad blue screen for that 2 min scene.Final thoughts: I loved the jungle chase seen! A bit long but Ford blowing up that jungle cutter and the blade slashing throw those cars was awesome. The sword fight was sort of good to, the idea of it anyway...presentation was eh. And the cliff was cool with the two cars. A huge thing from Indy films is the never staying in one car thing.. and it is back again. Harrison (nor a lot of the other characters) don't stay in the same car for long, they switch to others during the chase scenes... love it! The opening was good although sort of slow but the speed was just like Raiders after the first 20 min. I LOVED the chase through the college! When Indy is holding onto the back of the motorcycle it was very well done, and a small appearance from Tom Hank's son who was the one who asked the question to Ford after he and Shia drives through and slide down the college library's floor. The snake and sand pit scenes was well done as well and same with the best line of the movie, from the head Russian (who acted like the big bold Nazi in the fight with the plane in Raiders... the never die sort) which was ""For the love of god shut the hell up!"" when he is annoyed by the arguing between Ford and Allen. Oh and the ants! That was great! One of the best moments in Indy films...so gross but extremely well done! Overall it was a really good movie as a whole! Not outstanding and not perfect and NOT RAIDERS OF THE LSOT ARK! But better then Temple of Doom and the same as the Last Crusade! See it in theaters! And DO NOT EXPECT Another RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1242,bradyxplantdude,Indy's back and keeps on swinging,8,26 May 2008,"Okay, so I really liked this Indy film. I liked it even better the second time around. The action was fun, the acting was great, the chemistry between Indiana and Mutt was pitch-perfect, and, contradicting to my previous comment, the MacGuffin worked. I still laughed at the snake scene and was much more at the edge of my seat during the ant scene (even though I wasn't too thrilled about it during my first viewing). I think a lot of the negative reviewers need to watch the film a second time, because for some reason, it felt more like an Indiana Jones film the second time than the first, probably because the shock of it seeming so different from the previous three has worn off. I can't wait to pick this up the day it comes out on DVD (which I think will be in October).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1243,Harrison237,The Fall of the Great Ones...,5,24 May 2008,"I was just as excited as any other movie enthusiast would be when i sat down to the 4th instalment of the Indiana Jones series. when the movie ended and the credits began to roll up, my first feeling was....nothing. i had no idea what i thought about it. then shortly afterwards came my feared reaction. Disappointment.I have seen this film really criticised quite heftily in other reviews, and I'm not so sure that is fair. I gave it 5/10 because up until the last 20 minutes or so i was rather enjoying it. Harrison Ford was just as enjoyable as usual as the hat-grabbing hero. It did have some great action scenes, in particular the car/bike chase through the university. The humour was also superb, with some great one-liners and a brilliant 50s face off in a diner.However, i have several criticisms....the same criticisms that everyone seems to have. The CGI was the major downfall of this film, and this is coming from a 15 year old boy with no general problems with tasteful CGI. The claim that the CGI was used sparingly is, to be blatant, a lie. It was very over-done with far too many irritating shots of CGI animals reacting cutely at inappropriate times. The wonderful effects of the previous three films have been replaced with the grand CGI that is very common these days and just not nearly as entertaining to watch. I'd rather watch animatronic demises than watch someone disintegrate with boringly slick CGI But it was not just the CGI that held this film back. There was a terrible void left by the absence of the likes of Sean Connery, John Rhys-Davis and Denholm Elliot. There were no really lovable characters to accompany Indiana Jones on his adventure. Instead we are left with great actors with nothing to do, such as John Hurt (who's lack of any decent dialogue irritated me greatly) and Ray Winstone's pointless role as Mac.The score by John Williams was another disappointment. It seemed very reserved the whole way through, with nothing exciting or new to offer.And this film, for me, totally fell apart in the last 20 minutes, but i won't ruin the ending for you...thats just mean.Some harsh words said about it, but i it is worth a watch...may improve on second viewing...but will never be among it's predecessors for quality. So much better could be achieved by this great series and i can only hope it might someday get the ending that it deserves 5/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1244,Cuahutli6,Entertaining,9,23 May 2008,"I have to agree with some of the reviews. Of all the Indy movies this is the weakest. As a family film it had a little more blood than usual to be taking young kids, but then again, it DID receive a PG-13. But if seen overall it was great fun and entertainment. It might not win any Oscars but I still would recommend it.There were a few scenes that were a little over the top, and when the plot was finally fully revealed it seemed a bit corny, although, to be quite honest, about 15 minutes into the movie you kind of get the idea of where they were heading. I thought that the effects were great. I got the impression that the whole of the movie was to tie up some loose ends.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1245,rjcoop-1,"The weakest of the Indy films, but that ain't a bad thing!",7,25 May 2008,"Yes I'd say that out of all four films this is probably the weakest in terms of story and character. However, this doesn't mean the film is bad, in fact, I found it fun!ACTING: The acting was average in my opinion. Shia LaBeouf does a pretty decent job as Indy's son and brings a twist to the adventure. What I liked most was how Shia and Harrison had similar chemistry as that of Harrison and Sean Connery. Harrison Ford maybe 60-something, but he's still got it! He has the same moves, witty expressions and charm like he did the previous three films. The only problem I had with Ford is his voice. Personally I thought it was his voice that made him appear old rather than his looks. But still, forget what the critics say, Harrison Ford puts all the energy he has into Indiana and should be praised!Also looking her age is Karen Allen. Though I'm not a fan of her acting, her entrance scene was fantastic and takes you back to the very first film.Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone, John Hurt and Jim Broadbent all do a great job acting-wise too. However, there was not spark in any of them that made their characters stand out. CGI & EFFECTS: I would just like to say that Steven Spielberg said he would only use CGI if it was necessary, and boy was it necessary!Almost all the fight scenes were shot just as they were in the last three films, with no aid of computer generated image. But there are scenes in the film that require heavy CGI and special effects. Yes most people find this a bit tasteless, but I'd say it is most likely the best CGI I have seen in the last few years. I will be very surprised if its not up for a BAFTA or Oscar for best visual effects. STORY/WRITING/DIRECTING: The story, I think, is what makes this film the weakest of all four Indiana films. It just has no pattern and its completely over the top in some scenes. The problem with the story is that its too far fetched. I mean the scene with the atomic bomb and Indy hiding in a fridge and happens to be perfectly fine after. It just put me off for a few minutes after that scene.The writing isn't too bad actually. The script is still witty and keeps the same level of excitement the other films have. The directing wasn't Spielberg's best of late. He is one of my favourite directors, but I think he thought Indiana may be good enough to direct itself. But Steven, this one is really not. However this hasn't put me off him, he has directed some of my all time favourite movies. Everyone's allowed a few mistakes!OVERALL: Overall, like I said before, this film is the weakest of all four. But a lot of people are taking it far to seriously. Spielberg and Lucas both said before production that The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is to celebrate the Indiana Jones series and have a little fun! And its done just that!Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 7/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1246,sausagedogs-2,a prime example of a movie that should have been left to speculation,6,31 May 2008,"I went into the movie with as open a mind as i could possibly muster. Yes I did want it to be everything that i had come to love about about the first 3 movies but i was also aware that Indy was 20 years older and everything has changed. I didn't want it to be 5 years after the last movie because that would have been just stupid.However, without giving away any plot details (which you could have found out by now anyway!) i thought that the story was...well...silly. I know some will like it but for me it was too much of a stretch.I hated the way the movie was lit...and I hated that almost everything felt like it was on a set or in front of a blue screen. I'm watching Raiders right now and it at least looks real! They seemed to have actually left the Hollywood film studios and filmed in real locations...something to be said for that! Fantastic score...but its John Williams so what would you expect. Dramatic at some points...exceptionally cheesy in others...loved it! Some typically good one liners but (and it really pains me to say it) it was all a bit tired...however in saying that, if it had been a better storyline i probably would have enjoyed it more.An OK movie...but they really should have stopped at 3.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Let's just see how we can make maximum money with no effort by creating the lamest movie ever and tricking the people into paying to see it."" The story is PATHETIC, just as pathetic and Phantom Menace. The plot seems to have been written by an idiot, the cast was totally wasted and had no chemistry whatsoever. Humor? Uh? If there was any, I have obviously managed to miss it. Even the chase scenes that were so entertaining before did not manage to hold attention. In general, when you watch a movie, you are supposed to care for the characters, and in IJ4 I was all the time thinking ""OK, kill them already so this mistake of a movie can be over""Every lame thing you can think of was present in the movie, except for Indy getting a ride on a UFO.....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1248,mking147,I thought Spielberg was gonna avoid CGI??,7,23 May 2008,"Any people around my age (23) that were born around the time the trilogy was made and have grown up loving Indy will unfortunately leave the cinema thinking this could have been a whole lot better.There will also be moments during the film when you really want to look away but cant because you don't understand how that could be possible in an Indy movie - here I am referring to the scenes of gophers at the beginning ??, Mutt and Irina sword fighting on the trucks in the forest (terrible effects, why bother) and then the swinging through trees with a load of monkeys, all pretty shocking to watch.Im afraid there was also no real point in Karen Allen, Ray Winstone or William Hurt being in the movie, Karen Allen was obviously only in it for the final scene (and I think she should of tried joining Harrison Ford down the gym for 3 hrs a day before filming) Ray Winstone had no real character or dialogue to show what a good actor he is, and William Hurt was just plain annoying.There were some good moments in the film, namely every bit that didn't use CGI, thats when you really felt you were watching an Indy film, all the jokes were funny and the story was fairly good, pushing the boundaries as the previous films did in some way, I think the reason people will find this film different is that the previous 3 revolved around our history, where as what we find out in this film is always associated with the future and that may be hard for people to accept.Shia LeBeouf did a great job even with the hair style, I can see him working well again with Harrison in a 5th film which I feel they will have to do now to try and redeem some of the magic lost in this film, they definitely cannot leave it there. Best thing will be for Indy to die at the end and let Shia take over, as he tried to do by stealing the hat at the end of this film!Cate Blanchett also did well but the main baddie should have been a man Im afraid, about the toughest thing she does is crush an ant with her knees. Talking of the ants, someone else had also noted the rip off of 'the mummy' - i think it actually worked better in that film!I will definitely have to see the film again, when I am not expecting so much, hopefully then I will see it differently, at the moment it has not topped the previous three films, they are just classic great feel good films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Opening sequence was v good, and Harrison does manage to carry off the Indiana look still, even though he's looking a little haggard. At the beginning you think the story line is looking good and the plot is ""thickening"" so to speak. The action and the pace of the movie is good and it really keeps you gripped all the way up until the last 10-15 minutes, where the story line finishes with a rather weak and non-Indy like ending. My colleague who watched it with me is also a big Indiana Jones Fan, and he was also a little dismayed by the ending. Don't get me wrong, its a GOOD film and credit to Spielberg and the cast, but i think the story line is just NOT a typical Indiana Jones movie. Once you have seen the film and the emergence of the underlying piece up to the end sequence, you will see what i mean. Based on the story line and the ending being slightly disappointing, i rate it a 7.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1250,kh_freak15,"It May Be Disappointing, But It Is Still Indiana Jones!",8,21 December 2008,"The plot is so far-fetched that I was actually surprised that Spielberg directed it. All it is, basically, is mindless, cheesy action. The special effects are hit and miss and the story is a rare disappointment. Raiders is my favorite movie of all time and Temple of Doom and Last Crusade are entertaining, but this movie makes me sick. I give this a movie an 8 because I am a die-hard Indiana Jones fan and Harrison Ford actually came back. I will admit that I enjoy watching this movie.

1252,mendelmovie,"Little things don't ruin movies, unless you want them to.",7,29 July 2008,"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" ain't' perfect, but if you're going to tell me it's not an Indiana Jones movie, you're too angry to accept reality, pure and simple. As a whole, it's good old fashioned, familiar entertainment. And whether you like it or not, the other films were modeled to be exactly that. Granted, ""Raiders"" is on a whole other level because of the sheer brilliance of the execution, but let's not forget these were (and remain) no-more than expanded serials with better production values. Now, let this geek get something off his chest: In my humble opinion, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is one of the greatest non-stop action movies of all time, and a master-class in showmanship. So, you won't hear this tired line from my ass: ""...guys, at least it was better than Temple Of Doom!"" As far as I'm concerned, INDY 4 is easily the weakest of the four films. It's not even a discussion. But honestly, did any of us expect it not to be. We just wanted it to be damn good, yes? Well, IT IS DAMN GOOD and I'm tired of hearing otherwise from whining nerds who look to criticize. Why is it that when you ask a fellow Indy-file to express their disregard for this latest installment, all they can come up with is, ""The monkeys sucked!"" or ""The gopher's were awful!""? It's because THINGS have corrupted our movie-going experience. We're too consumed with THINGS to appreciate the broader package. Yes, the gopher's were unnecessary but for heaven's sake, lets not forget about the terrific overall opening of the film. Of course the Tarzan homage was completely unacceptable, but are we so consumed with disgust about it that we're blind to the equally terrific tank chase that surrounds it. Oh yes, I almost forgot about the (supposed) grand failure of INDY 4: ALIENS. OK, let me tell you something you already know: The INDY films have always reflected the period in which they take place. Are we so hung up on aliens that we don't recognize this? I think we all agreed before seeing the movie that it was best for Harrison to age naturally in this one. The man is 65, and it's only natural for his character to be living in the late 50's. Martians and flying saucers belong to the 50's and whether you want to accept that or not doesn't remove it from the equation. And don't give me this lightweight, ""It was too implausible"" monologue. If you buy Nazi's being exploded by a demon-angel, hearts getting ripped out while the victim is still alive and a cup of Christ curing a gunshot wound, you can handle a damn alien. Sure, the CG on the alien could have been better, but narratively, it was a perfectly acceptable MacGuffin. At the end of the day, this movie has plenty of wonderful scenes, some jaw-dropingly spectacular ones (the motorcycle chase that ends in the library) and some flaws to go with it. Indeed, I could have done without all the boring archaeological exposition in the middle section and some of the overt ADR was irritating. Sure, Ray Winstone wasn't given much of a role and Marion was underwritten. But hey, some folks hate the way Marcus was treated and can't stomach all the slapstick comedy in Last Crusade. I'm one of those folks, but I would never classify Last Crusade as anything less than a terrific movie! I'm also tired of hearing about Frank Darabont's draft. I read every page and while it starts off well, it gets mighty boring mighty fast. I won't cover Shia, John Hurt and Cate Blanchett because I thought they were all quite good (especially Blanchett). And don't even try to tell me Harrison Ford didn't bring his game because he most certainly did, AND THEN SOME.Of course this is all one man's opinion, and if you truly hated the film, you're entitled. But I'm also entitled to tell you why you're wrong. INDY 4 captures the spirit of Indiana Jones, without being every-bit as good as the previous films and STILL manages to stand on it's own two feet as solid escapist entertainment. As someone who was not in favor of a fourth installment initially, I would actually welcome a 5th installment. And the critics of this film don't have to admit it now, but you all know you'll be standing in line with me if it happens.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1253,zombienosh,A bona-fide popcorn-guzzler of a film,7,13 June 2008,"Once you get over how crusty Harrison Ford looks these days, and how Cate Blanchett is the hands-down winner of the Worst Russian Accent category at the Oscars (narrowly beating Sean ""Hunt For Red October"" Connery), this is a top film that ticks all the action boxes.I think its only real minus is the script is not as snappy as its predecessors - Ford reads off his lines in the same eye-rolling weary fashion that Alec Guinness did in his Jedi robes. So for most of the film, he mumbles his lines and hopes no-one hears them.If you put it against the previous three Indy films, I admit it suffers. But then there was no real way it could live up to the hype after such a long hiatus (See also: Star Wars) but then, who cares? A few familiar faces are there, it's got John Williams tunes, it's got a bonkers plot, it's got highly improbable action sequences, a good few laughs along the way, and an ending that will (probably) draw a close on the old Indy saga.So shut your face, watch the film and shovel popcorn down your gullet.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The Action in the movie was well done as was the effects and i prayed Geroge Lucas wouldn't smother it with Death Star Like Effects and to my relief he didn't. You can see i rated this movie 9/10 and for one reason only , the reason being to all who have seen will know (the part of the movie where your like What!?) but it manages to at least make it work and overall i was happy with Indy 4 and the nice way it leaves it open as i'm sure we all want it to.

1255,alakabaz,Doesn't feel like an Indy film,5,24 May 2008,"7.5/10 I want to start off by admitting that i am a huge Indiana Jones fan and love the trilogy. I have followed the production of this ever since it was announced and have been really looking forward to it. However there are quite a few problems with George Lucas and Steven Spielbergs latest adaption.First off is Harrison Ford who is one of my favourite actors of all time. He is great and is in fantastic physical condition for someone the same age as my Grandfather. He was never going to let the fans down with his performance and its amazing that he performs the majority of his own stunts-specifically the motorcycle chase. Even though he delivers with his performance, he isn't given a great deal to work with as he seems to figure out the puzzles and riddles left for him in under two minutes-much like Nic Cage in National Treasure. In addition to this is the re-appearance of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. The two work well together, but just squabble at each other like Jon Voight and Helen Mirren in National Treasure 2. In fact their relationship is exactly the same as JV and HM as the argue with each other before the future events inevitably bring back past feelings-its supposed to be National Treasure copying Indy, not the other way about. However she makes little contribution apart from having a constant huge smile on her face and providing a link between Indy and Mutt, played by Shia LaBeouf. Now, i like Shia and think he's a talented actor but i don't know if he was right for this part. Everybody knows he's Indy's son and Lucas and Koepp try to bring out characteristics of Indy in Mutt. In stead of having skill with the whip, he has skill with a sword. He is arrogant which becomes really irritating. Indy was over-confident and charismatic, but not arrogant. He is also meant to be tough and thinks he's the real deal, but he doesn't pull it off because lets face it, if you were held at gunpoint down a dark alley, you would be hoping it was someone like Shia. Enough said.In saying this the plot is weak. The theme of Indy going in search of some ancient mythical artifact stays true, but this time it is taken to another level. If people found the whole magic stones and voodoo dolls too far in ToD, wait till you see this. I don't want to give too much away but Lucas just goes overboard and brings in his love for sci-fi. There isn't much in the way of characterisation either. The villain (played rather well in my opinion) by Cate Blancett has psychic powers (which we never see demonstrated) is supposed to give reason for her cause of chasing the skull.A positive aspect is Spielberg's direction which is terrific, especially in the car chase scenes. His use of camera work is great, but we wouldn't expect anything else from the legendary director himself. The action in the film is really fun and entertaining, and there's lots of it, but too much of it is unrealistic or just plain ridiculous. The worst is when Mutt swings through the jungle Tarzan style along with some monkeys who happen to provide help in distracting the villains. Also is two events during the car chase in the jungle when the tops of the vehicles get mangled, but they come out okay. Despite this the chase scene was brilliant. But, to cope with all this action CGI has been used, a LOT! Which Spielberg promised their would be less of. The ending is slightly awkward and leaves the possibility of a fifth film being made which Lucas has discussed and i hope will never be made.Overall this is very entertaining but the thing that separates this Indy from the rest of the films is that it just doesn't feel like an Indiana Jones film, it just seems like another adventure film with a classic character and soundtrack. To be honest just about everything is great, apart from the plot which varies from weak to absurd. Lucas like the Star Wars prequels, takes things too far because he has the resources to do so. I'm not saying that the franchise has been ruined, but i think people may choose to consider this as a separate film outside the trilogy which will always remain what they are. Classic.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1256,aravindakshansunil,Better than Temple Of Doom but not as good as Raiders or Last Battle,6,23 May 2008,"This movie is not one of the best I have seen, but in recent times it is one of the best movies I have seen. I'm only 19, but i have seen all the old classics. When I heard this movie was being made I downloaded and watched all the other Indiana Jones movies, I was awestruck, and i was expecting something more in this movie. The movie itself was very good and very entertaining. The factors you will miss is the one feeling u get when u finish watching a Indiana Jones movie. I felt that in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Battle. The direction is good, the effects are kept to minimum, the CGI has not been over used. The story is one of Spielberg's favourite outline Aliens storyline. Most of all Ford looks better than ever, he's like 50 or 60 i guess but he does things with ease and great old style. The movie is worth watching in theatre it is not was amazing as some people say it is because they are either big Indiana Jones fans or they have not seen the previous movies because they are too young. The movie is not as bad as people say it is because they are going in expecting another Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Battle. Go in with a open mind you will like it. Two things you will hate is that you will miss the Indiana feeling and if you are like me you will question why does every superhero are having kids these days? Superman has a kid and now Indiana Jones has a kid. We don't want kids to replace fathers, we want the heroes to stay as they are. Personally i wish for the team to make one more Indiana Jones movie with Harrison Ford, why because I don't want the future to say that the series ended like with this. When i watched temple of doom, i felt sorry for the whole crew because they just messed the legacy of Raiders of Lost Ark, but when i watched Last Battle I thought they bounced back really good because it was so damn cool and as good as Raiders of Lost Ark. This movie is better than Temple of Doom but i want them to make one more movie which will end and follow perfect legacy of Raiders or Last Battle.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1257,ericberber9,Satisfied but unimpressed,7,23 May 2008,"It was Okay. And ONLY okay.I was really expecting more from this movie. I had my hopes up (perhaps to high)and I was partly disappointed. No, it wasn't Ford being old (it actually worked well, no it wasn't Shia (he does fairly well) and no, it wasn't even the E.T. theme (fairly interesting minus the slapped-together-in-a-minute ending.No, what did it for me was the CGI. Don't get me wrong, I love CGI and in this film, some parts of it made the movie a lot more exciting. But other parts (believe me, you'll know which) look absolutely ridiculous.So if you've seen all the Indy's and are going to remember the good 'ol days when Indy was quick-witted and and heroic (and you have nothing else to spend 12 bucks on) then go ahead and go.

I am now 21, although I still have my adventuresome side, I am now much more intelligent, and have a strong sense of logic... this movie, although having wondrous adventure, lacks everyday logic and science that would make the movie watchable, Harrison Ford plays an aged Indiana Jones (duh!) and Shia Lebouf plays his estranged son. (He must have the best publicist in the world!!) many of the things that happen in the movie bend and break the laws of physics, such as an object having a strong magnetic pull, yet objects are simply removed with human hands... as the movie went on I felt that Indiana Jones, a man who wanted to preserve history for eons to come, had changed into a destructive old man.

1259,eff1975,"Fun, but not your typical Indy movie",7,23 May 2008,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Indiana Jones movies. In the 80's it was all about Star Wars and Indiana Jones, those WERE the 80's to me pretty much. So, needless to say I was very excited to hear that Indy was coming back to the big screen! I've read the reviews of people trashing this movie and saying that it shouldn't have been made. I disagree with that. I am glad they made the movie, and I think it's a good ending to the saga. However, I have also read reviews comparing this to the original and saying that it's ""as good, if not better than Last Crusade"". I cannot agree with that either. I think overall it is a fun movie, but I wouldn't necessarily say it holds up to the classic Indy standard that I was hoping it would.I didn't mind the nuclear fridge scene like everyone else is complaining about. It's unbelievable yes, but how many other scenarios that Indy's been in have been believable? I also didn't think the monkey scene was bad. I mean, it was a bit goofy, but it wasn't ""I walked out of the theater"" bad.I think all the acting was very good, and I don't really have a problem with the script. I actually liked the story and was intrigued throughout. I think my only major problem with this movie was that they tried to shove too many characters in the movie and it took away from developing certain characters. I think if they stuck with Mutt's character as the sidekick and Spalko's character as the villain it could've been a better movie. I don't think the character of Mac was even needed, and unfortunately I do agree that Marian's character wasn't used properly.Those are really my only criticism's. I didn't mind the whole ""alien"" theme, it was clear that even Indy thought it was silly during one scene in the movie, but they made it believable. It was a fun ride at the end, and I actually do look forward to seeing it again (in a better theater, I think the lack of sound and small screen didn't help my viewing). I'm glad to see Indy back on the big screen and perhaps more Indy movies to come with Henry Jones, the III????",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1260,grinningkat-1,I'm a die-hard Indiana Jones Fan-and Loved this film!,9,24 May 2008,"I have been an Indiana Jones fan since my father took me to see Raiders in the theater when I was 5. I have read every novel, every comic book, and yes...I went in costume to the midnight premier. Needless to say I was initially disappointed. I was so used to the Nazis that I had trouble adapting to the new Indiana time period. However, the flashes back to the novels of his later years exploded in my mind.The bad reviews seem to come mostly from people who only know Indiana from his movies. Have you played the games? Have you read the books? Indiana has met aliens in dozens.The point is, that the movie was made in a new era. A new style of film making that has changed even the way the Star Wars films were produced. What is truly important is did you enjoy the film? The truth is a resounding YES! Indy IV is an incredible thrill ride through jungles and forgotten temples. The corny 1980's dialogue is still present and the cheesy tag lines we have all come to love from Indy are still there.The film is great, and a welcome addition to the trilogy. I would rank it below raiders and temple, but I think it beats Crusade hands down.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1261,lobster1071,George Lucas...destroyer of fond memories,1,23 May 2008,"Yes, it's true. This is the Phantom Menace, Terminator 3, Spider-Man3, and Alien3 of the Indiana Jones franchise. I never thought I would see the day that another Indiana Jones movie would make The Temple of Doom look like a masterpiece of cinema. That movie at least had some thrill, but was still obviously the worst of the previous three.There's no getting around it, and many of the reviews blasting this current release are quite correct, so I'm not going to recap what many others have already written. There is no heart, no character development, and no suspense in this movie. This has to be a joke that was conceived by Spielberg and Lucas, and the joke is on us, the viewing public. They will no doubt rake in piles of money thrown at them from people like me hoping to relive the magic that the character of Indiana Jones gave them. However, this movie not only doesn't have any magic, but makes you feel angry at yourself for being ripped off so easily.I have been frequently disappointed by Hollywood sequels, with very few exceptions. Based on that history, I went into this movie expecting to be let down by not capturing the thrill of the original three. However, I also had it in my mind that I would at least be entertained for a couple hours watching it, and walk away with a good feeling and a few chuckles. The movie even failed to do that.Please Hollywood, go back to puppets, string, plastic models, living creatures and makeup. Computer generated effects look more unrealistic now, than using the tools of the past. Maybe someone needs to bring Ray Harryhausen back to the studio for some tips. I don't know what the answer is, but original movies of the past seem to have been made when visionaries just starting out were hungry and full of ideas. The stories and scenery they created were exciting to listen to and look at. Their remakes are frequently feeble attempts, horribly done, and very obviously made with the single purpose of seeing how much money can be made on the nostalgia from their past creations.Thank you George Lucas for stomping out yet another fond memory from childhood. It took me a while to pretend that the Star Wars prequels never happened. Looks like I'll have to do the same with the Indiana Jones sequels as well.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1262,rlg4343,Another Classic to go into the Lucas/Spielburg vault!,10,23 May 2008,"Lucas has once again invented a classic story to entertain millions of people. But through the veil of greatness that he has created for this series of movies there are a couple of faults. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for all of his ideas and I think the man is a genuine mastermind when it comes to movie ideas. It's just that Georgie has become too reliant on aliens and stuff like that. I think that when it comes to Indiana Jones films they should stick to ancient artifacts that have sort of religious tie-ins. That's why Temple of Doom was the least successful of the series. I loved it but it just didn't have the same spark. Another problem I had with the film was David Koepp. This was probably the best film he has ever written, and if the film didn't have him it would have been better. He's just not a great writer. He's part of the reason that Spielburg's career hasn't been really good lately. Speaking of Spielburg, he did an amazing job in this film. He did just as I expected of him. If only Lucas didn't have such good relations with him George would have directed Raiders and probably the rest of the series and the Indiana Jones films would have been that much better. Oh well! They are still some of the greatest films ever created. Some of the plot and action was a little far-fetched, but it's a movie so who cares? All in all, This is a great film!!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1263,jcapogrossi,"A scaled back ""Indiana Jones"" for an older and wiser Harrison Ford",7,27 May 2008,"Pretty good movie. It was cool, but that's about it.First off, not as much action as in the former films, but that makes sense. If anything, Spielberg tries to have realistic details added to his adventure films, and having fight scene after fight scene, chase after chase, like temple of Doom, would not be too realistic with a 65 Year old Indiana Jones (and, likewise, a 65 year old Harrison Ford.)I think Spielberg wanted to bring Indy Jones into the Atomic Age, and he did that. Having an older and wiser Indy who has to use his brain more than the whip, also makes sense. This film had more slow sequences than the original three, and while watching the move, I had to realize that with the lead actor's age (and the character's age) this is to be expected. Many people disliked the refrigerator scene and I could agree and say it strained credibility, but then, Indiana Jones as a series is a serial adventure... Meantime, the details, the locations, and the very realistic tombs and ancient South American temples were really well done.However, as mentioned, don't expect the non stop action of ""Raiders"" or ""Temple of Doom""...""jumping out of a plane in a raft, to slide down the mountain, go off the cliff, land in the river rapids, etc...mine car chases, being dragged from trucks, running from boulders, etc etc"" ...Indiana Jones is back.... but takes more breathers...This film had it's cool moments...Some may disagree, but to me, the fire ants were one standout, also, the chase scene with the motorcycle had some ond fashioned stunt work and was cool...but, once again, much more scaled back action compared to the original films. William Hurt's character was at times annoying, as the professor who has (temporarily) lost touch with reality due to the effects of the Skull, but Hurt mostly pulled it off...Karen Allen's appearance was decent, but I don't know if she was as invested in this film as she could have been...Her performance in ""Raiders"" is a classic and it's hard to beat that...As for Shia Lebouf, Uh, Nope.. I don't think he'll take over the series. Lebouf played, pretty much, ""himself""...with a few 50's-isms thrown in...he didn't ruin the movie, though, he did a decent job...Also, the George Lucas-isms of gofers, monkeys, etc were OK...they lasted a few seconds and were over (get over it, Lucas haters)To me, as I left this film, the question to me is not ""Who will replace Indiana Jones?""... The question is, ""Who will create the next ""Indiana Jones?"" in the film world, as in who can bring to the screen a whole new adventure that is the same caliber as these films?"" Spielberg and Lucas created an action/adventure series that is pretty much ""one of a kind"". Looking at more recent ""blockbuster action films"" like Transformers, Speed Racer, etc we can soon see that, so far, not many films are matching up in acting/sets/stunts/humor/action with these movies made back then. It isn't the CGI- it's the heart that is needed in the films of 2008.We gotta keep in mind that, just as Harrison Ford may soon retire, at some point in the not too distant future, Steve Spielberg will retire...and those are some big shoes to fill. This movie left me thinking about the future of movies, but not necessarily hoping for any more Indiana Jones films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1264,kyleprohaska,"Could be better, Could be worse...",6,22 May 2008,"Well...not what I expected for sure. The film was WAY TOO KING KONGISH. The color palate wasn't something I liked, I sensed that from the first trailer I saw. The CGI was fairly cheesy in a lot of parts, almost like they wanted it to feel old Hollywood but adding that kind of perspective and lighting on old Hollywood with new age color just doesn't fit right...The movie seemed awful slow too, too much explaining of what's going on. I know he's a smart guy but there was 10x more searching for clues in this. From room to room, another clue, ""what's that mean"", ""it means this"", move to another room, etc. That continues for quite a while without much interesting things to keep you fixed on Ford.Some choices lines in this films were cringe awful, from Ford himself too. I can't remember them specifically but one of them was something to the effect of ""John...my friend"" or something lame like that. Yuck. Lots of lines needed some work, or they we're said in the wrong way IMO.The part with the fridge and the monkeys...easily the worst part of the film in terms of it being awkwardly unrealistic. I felt the tone in the theater where everyone was kinda offbeat about it, not sure whether to go along with it and laugh, or think it was stupid. Lots of other moments like the waterfall stuff, blade that busts through the vehicles to cut them in half, lots of things that would have probably been OK if there was 1 of them....but not this many! It was SPIDERMAN 3 all over again with too many things to tell and the inability to let a few of them go for the stories sake. Trying to please the fans TOO MUCH...and you make it annoying.Cate B. character didn't have any depth to me, she felt extremely thin, and her ""death"" at the end was so quick didn't have any kind of qualities where you were happy she died, or the death was spectacular...it was just kinda sudden. Shia was good overall, Marion's character was thin too, she didn't really do anything...I forgot she was in the movie most of the time. I think the more disappointing part of the entire film was the story itself. With all the figuring out and explaining I actually lost where the film was going. In Raiders you know they are going after the ark, in this that goal they had didn't seem so great...so they lost me in caring that they should even get there. So really that ruined the film a lot of the time. If your not caring about what they are striving for on screen...you wont care about anything. That kinda happened to me. Plus the overuse of different rooms. This room into that, then another spectacle room for 2 mins, then another, then another, then another...bleh.Gag at the end with the hat, the ark showing in the box, and a few other little nods to the fans were great fun :) I'm glad those were in there.Lots more to say but if your reading this and thinking I didn't enjoy watching it, your wrong. I did love watching the film in the theater, lots more things I didn't like than I would have thought...but overall a great experience.Also, none of what I'm saying is an attack on Spielberg at all...the script was the problem, hands down. All the rest could've been put up with if it wasn't for the script. Films change because the director changes. Not many drastically different films were made in between 80-89 for Steven. There was lots of films yea but he didn't stray off from his usual style until later. Even farther out from his usual style when 2000 hit. So for Indy 4 to be expected to be like the old ones is pretty ridiculous. I didn't expect Raiders #2, I just expected it to be a bit more like the older films STYLE...I would've been happier just if the color palette and cinematography matched. Black,Brown,Gray,Yellow,Green. In this one we had lots of sunset sky's and all sorts of stuff unseen in the others that made it weird. Ah well. If Spielberg made Raiders OVER AGAIN one year after he made it the first time it would be a different film.Just to clarify what I meant when I said the story didn't intrigue me. The older Indy films all had a goal in mind. Find the ark, Find and return the stones, Find the Grail. Why though? Ark was to keep it away from the Nazi's, Doom was to save a village and find the children, Crusade was to find the Grail before the Nazi's do.Crystal Skull...find the lost city of gold and return the skull to uh....uh....o who cares.Thats what I was talking about, the reason they were even on the quest felt like a bore to me. Just didn't feel the same I guess. I knew where they were going and was along for the ride but my care for that ride was pretty slim.I still give it a 6/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1265,giorgioluciano,a positive surprise,7,10 August 2008,"Beauty stays in the eyes of the beholder. I thought that Indy was too old for this film and that I would felt myself soooo old looking at this one. (I'm one of those guys that watched this a the movies) But it was a positive surprise. I mean comparing this episode with the old ones everything is there. Action, Action, simple characters, simple jokes, the good and the villains, incredible situation and all the circus that we should expect from a Indy movie. So Finally I thought. Hey it's honest it gave us the old Indiana back, so it's just fine I don't' feel betrayed by this movie. So if you look with fresh eyes it's very enjoyable one. Of course if you try to find a logic,you will be disappointed, but hey do the first Indy movie had a logic ? Were they really accurate ? Try to rediscover the children is inside you and you will enjoy it again. Isn't that the magic of cinema ? Should we blame Spielberg for us growing up ? the answer is up to you",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1266,catherine2585200,It's a very meaningful movie,10,25 May 2008,"In my perspective, it's a very meaningful movie. It didn't add a lot of fiction in it but combat instead so it wont cheapen it's original but strengthen it. I've learned from the movie that, if a person has too much greed in knowledge or wisdom will be destroyed to death. The superior the harder to obey the One with power and be humble but the one who does has rooted in the bedrock of life deeply. Gold is not the power but the knowledge. You live up your own value, nothing else can really raise yourself up. It shows good characters in this movie, such as the act of honesty, integrity, compassion, courage or sacrifice. He is the life...REALL Live. We should really glorify Him through our life.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1267,redfourrojocuatro1,A sorry ending to a great Trilogy,1,1 July 2008,"I voted this movie a 1 because of the gaping plot holes and the bad acting. I also gave it a 1 because of the unbelievable amount of ridiculous factual errors that were made in this movie. They are too many to list. I will just name a few. Mr. Director, if in the future you decide to make a movie that is not set in NYC or LA, (Let's face it, that's where most of them are set) have someone who has been outside of NYC and LA watch your movie before you inflict it on the whole world. 1. Gunpowder is not magnetic. Look up the ingredients if you do not believe me. 2. They don't have thunderstorms in Peru. Weird but true. But they were creeping through an old cemetery so they had to have a thunderstorm. 3. We are supposed to believe that the Iguaçu falls are connected to the Amazon river which is somehow connected to the Atacama desert. Don't these people realize that even though they are stupid other people might not be. We actually have geography books. 4. No one knows who made the Nazca lines. It may have been Indians. It may not. We don't know who made them. To refer to the Nazca Indians and prattle on about their culture definitively is idiotic. 5. Harrison Ford can't pronounce the name of the explorer Francisco de Orellena even close to correctly and yet we are supposed to believe that he knows a bunch of languages. (By the way ""Dr"" Jones. A polyglot knows a lot of languages. A Linguist studies human communication in all its variety.) 6. The crystal skulls actually exist but are commonly thought to be 18-19th century forgeries. 7. At the end of the movie, the old Englishman is ""addressing the aliens"" the greasy haired punk who is Indy's son ""asks what language is that?"" Ford answers ""Mayan"". Never mind that they are in South America, thousands of kilometers away from where Mayan was ever spoken. 8. Magnetic skull. Ha. During the extended period of ""catch"" or ""keep away"" with the supposedly magnetic skull I was wondering who turned the thing off. I kept waiting for it to get stuck to the side of the jeep or something. 9. So, they are walking through a Peruvian market and the mood music is Mexican ranchera music. 10. It seems someone like Indiana Jones would know how to get out of quicksand on your own. I have done it. It is not that hard. Especially from a small pool like the one he was in. Especially if he is calm enough to have a long conversation with his ex/future wife. It just gave them an opportunity to use the plot device of ""throw the man a snake!"" Yeah, right.Enough.I go to the movies fully prepared to suspend disbelief. I know that the movie is going to say to me ""in such and such place this happened"" and I know that it really did not happen. But I want the movie to have good acting. I want the movie to be consistent with reality as I know it. This movie failed my expectations. And let's face it, you don't have high expectations from an Indiana Jones movie when it comes to reality. The other Indiana Jones movies I have seen over and over again. This one I saw the one time.Just a thought, for an ""archaeologist"" doesn't Indiana Jones destroy a lot of archaeology?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1268,yoman23,The Fall of The Legend... Unfortunately:/,4,30 May 2008,"What I was hoping for was a movie of a similar format and quality as Riders of The Lost Arc, but I was largely disappointed... The vast number of mistakes made in the movie, unbelievable stunts and superhuman abilities were simply unbearable. There were moments, where I thought that I will soon go back in time and fell like 12 year old again and enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, I did not. Furthermore, there were moments, when i wanted to leave the cinema, and this does not happen to me very often. Just to give a few trivias and week points: nuclear bomb and fridge (who came up with that idea?...), highway in the jungle (i mean - come on, they way going 70 mph, straight line , car near car - where do you find jungle like that?...), and finally - aliens... I have similar feelings comparing this Indy to the first one like i have comparing first part of Pirates of the Carrabian to the last one.It is still an adventure movie... but not a good one.

Luckily Spielberg lets you know right off that you're in for a joke when Indiana survives a direct hit by a nuclear bomb by hiding in a refrigerator, are you kidding me!?!?! From there on in it's one ridiculous jam after another, including a few plunges off what look like 50-100 foot waterfalls, but I'm sure the jungle jeep/boat of the 50's could handle that. I know, this is Indiana Jones and you have to let a few things go because it is after all a movie, but come on, this was too much.

You have to expect to suspend some level of disbelief when your watching, not just Indiana Jones, but any of these type of movies.Oh, and by the way, the spaceship rocked!!!!

1272,tkaczar,Fits in with the others very nicely!,9,22 May 2008,"I came into this movie expecting a few things.1.) Shia Labeouf- What the trailers speculated was an annoying tag-a-long, much like Short Round from Temple of Doom who really gave no meaning or help to the adventure other than an inconvenience. It couldn't be more wrong. He played the role perfectly as a side-kick and in some parts, the hero. The biggest thing that made his character was the chemistry between him and Indy. It compares to the Jr./Sr. relationship in the Last Crusade.2.) Aliens!?!?!?- Come on. Spielberg has obviously lost it. Nope. Although the idea was outlandish, he managed to make it believable and seemed to mirror the biblical themes of the first three but still managed to retain its independence. There really was never an alien/sci-fi presence or feel until the very end. It was able to keep the mystical, magical feel much like the Ark in Raiders and the Stones in T.O.D. This new aspect really added to the creepiness level of the ending scenes with the alien skeletons and cave paintings. Although a bit predictable, you were always guessing of how the aliens would be addressed by the finish.3.) Indy is OLD!- I was worried that the film was going to be chock full of Indiana Jones is old jokes and gags. It seemed to be living up to that for the first 20 minutes. But luckily pretty much all of those gags seem to cease to exist after this and it melds very nicely back into the Indy film. After they get all of the old jokes out of the system, the only reminder is his very gray hair during the few times his hat was off. Harrison Ford performed as well as he did back in the first three Indy films. Overall, I'd say it is a tie with Last Crusade for my second favorite Indy film for the series, Raiders being first. You just can't beat the epic-ness of the film. The performances are fantastic and the character chemistry is memorable. I think Cate Blanchett's character could have used a bit of work, but fit nicely in as an Indy villain. I love that they brought back Marion and paid homage to Henry Sr. and Brody. I wished that Sallah could have made some type of cameo in it but there was not one. The action is fantastic, probably the best out of the 4 films. Their decision to use as little CGI as possible proved to be a wonderful idea which allowed them to retain the Indy/Comic Book feel. Great movie and I definitely plan on seeing it again soon!9/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1273,sviastoslav,"Brilliant, magnificent piece of work",2,22 May 2008,"The genius behind The Phantom Menance, Mr. George Lucas, has teamed up with with the academy-award winning director Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List, The Color Purple) to produce another film of excruciating greatness. Not to ignore its faults, I would give Kingdom of the Crystal Skull only a half star less than 2 Girls 1 Cup, perhaps because of the latter's slightly more convincing special effects.The story is very well-researched - we learn that nuclear experiments happened during the 1950s. And the cast scores big with a special guest appearance by the entire crew of Apocalypto. If Mr. Gibson should ever wonder how natives were able to fit jungle chase and pyramid building into their busy schedule, then Kingdom of the Crystal Skull shall provide a key piece to that puzzle.But what I love best about this movie is its attention to archaeological facts and detail: the producers must have consulted several teams of archaeologists before writing the script. I don't know any real-life archaeologist but a quick browse through the internet makes me believe that the movie (and Lucas' imaginative mind) may have some basis in reality.Mr. Lucas should be applauded for his accurate portrayal of native cultures (Quechua is still spoken in Peru!) and their important role in challenging Dr. Jones' effort to remove their artifacts. Why travel and see other parts of the world? Go watch this last installment of Indiana Jones and you will find great adventure right there behind the big screen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1274,asleepordead17,This is not a disappointment at all,8,24 May 2008,"When Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was announced, I was just as excited as the next Indiana Jones fanboy. As with every sequel, every fan speculates if it could possibly be better than the prior. Well, Indiana Jones is one of those few franchises that can fulfill expectations every time. This installment is no different.From the moment you see the American soldiers massacred by the Russians to the moment Indy and company see the pyramids flooded, you know you're going to be on the edge of your seat for most of your screening. This installment is actually quite different from the other Indiana Jones films, but in a good way. Through dialogue, you see a bit more of Indy's character and his son Mutt (even though he doesn't know that Mutt's his son until the middle of the movie). Thus, this delves a bit into character development. What exactly is this movie about? In a nutshell, I'd say that Russians forcefully recruit Indy to help them find magnetic crystal skulls which can give them access to extreme knowledge and power. Or, in one word: aliens. Yes, Indy faces the extraterrestrial in this installment (albeit not directly). To not spoil much more of the movie, I shall say no more.Steven Spielberg's famed direction in this movie is amazing and so is George Lucas' production. The story is the brainchild of David Koepp and it's a great storyline. Actually, I stated before that this film goes into character development. Because of this, my favorite character is Oxley, who for half the film is basically retarded and obsessed with the crystal skull Indy finds. His naive quips and obsession with the crystal skull provide comic relief for most of the movie, along with Mutt's obsession with his hair and Indy's one-liners. Overall, a great film that's definitely worthy of a look.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1276,yogi_jm,It's Indiana Jones,7,1 June 2008,"First off, I do not pretend to know anything about film making so I will not bad mouth the Directors and Producers, and second it is a good movie.I read the first 2 pages of comments on IMDb and noticed and unbelievable amount of disappointment. Some people are saying that George Lucas should retire, another person said that he is not a filmmaker but power hungry mad man. Apart from the fact that whoever wrote that is a jealous prick, I have one thing to say. Lets see you do better.Yes the fighting and running and action is illogical, but its Indiana Jones. Look at the first three movies, there were boats falling from planes on to mountains and then sliding down.I believe that the greatest problem in the movie is the lack of understanding from the viewers. The series came out more than 20 years ago, that means we were all more than twenty years younger, a lot of the fans now a days were not even born yet. People change, opinions change. Twenty years ago when everyone was younger Indiana was more special because kids, teenagers liked to see heroes in completely illogical circumstances, its funny and entertaining, I mean who has not dreamed of being Indiana at least once. Except now, 20 years later, people are older, grown up so to speak, and thus with different expectations and opinions. Why do you think it is so popular amongst people who saw the movies as kids, than people who saw the movies as adults.When a person asks an adult who saw the movie in 1981 as a kid, ""Did you like Indiana Jones: The Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" the response is, ""I loved it!"" When a person asks a kid today, ""Did you like Indiana Jones: The Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" the response is, ""I loved it!""Maybe Spielberg and Lucas out did themselves, or maybe it is the viewer, the fan, the customer that should be blamed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Was it any good? I left with mixed feelings after seeing it...Good: Harrison Ford. If one thing worked it was him, I mean sure he is older, but still I found him to be completely believable as the man in the hat. To bad he didn't get much screen time on his own. LaBeuf was also OK as the young support cast, although I feel his introduction felt a bit to rushed. Overall the first part of the movie was good, not to much (visible) cg, and some funny stunts.Bad: Well apart from the Nuclear Bomb scene (what the hell was that about??), the first half was pretty good, but the second...man where to begin...Firstly I'm not a huge fan of excessive use of cg, sure you can get some amazing scenes...but something is lost from the 'good old ways'. The old indiana movies were all about the dirty gritty hand-to-hand action. There were explosions and some crazy stunt, of course, but it never got to over-the-top (well apart from Temple of Doom maybe, but I consider that to be the weakest of the old movies). Here it quickly descends into the standard cg generated spectacle I feared it would be. The whole jungle scene was just laughable...and the aliens...I mean come on, Lucas couldn't have come up with a better story than that, in 20 years?? Oh well time to stop ranting, I give this movie a 5/10 because it is Indy, but if they ever make a 5th installment (and they most certainly will) I really hope they get their act together and do things right.Guess I'll have to put my trust in Batman now...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The script was absolutely bad. Amateur, at the most. Waste of time and talent. And waste of my wait. And everybody else's (who feel the same - i.e. bad).

This film is a well-paced action adventure with some splendid moments of humour, excellent set pieces and a terrific central performance by Harrison Ford.Its always excellent to see Karen Allen on screen, although she is a little underused.Indeed the whole cast features some excellent performances from superb older actors with Jim Broadbent being a perfect replacement for the late Denholm Elliott.

1281,souvikthecreator,The buccaneer is back-Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is pure nostalgia,8,1 June 2008,"Nostalgia can be a dangerous thing  it can forge a connection as easily as it alienates, depending on who is speaking and how, and more importantly perhaps, who is listening.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is pure nostalgia. It is a loving revival by the team that created Indiana Jones 27 years ago  Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Harrison Ford  for an audience who grew up with him. Indy was their first date with a real adventurer, an action hero who was flesh and bones, who wasn't born in the pages of a comic book, who had no superpowers and was not backed by technology or a team of agents out to save the world. Indiana Jones was a buccaneer, and that is what he remains.But does the world need a buccaneer anymore? If the unusually long gap in the Indy franchise  it's been 19 years since The Last Crusade was released  has caused problems, it is not the expected ones. Harrison Ford, at 64, brings the same magic to the screen as he did two decades ago. Indy wears his age exceedingly well. Ford can look out from underneath his fedora and crack one-liners (as corny and as delightful as ever) and, by virtue of the lines on his face and the color of his hair  the mileage as Henry Jones Jr would call it  it suddenly sounds like wisdom.Are the near-death experiences improbable for a senior citizen? Of course, but they were just as ludicrous when performed by a 45-year-old, or by the 22-year-old Shia LaBeouf, who is very much the surprise package of Crystal Skull.The problem with the film may turn out to be nothing as superficial as looks. It is that Indy was born into a very different world. In that world, a boulder hot on the heels of a man running through a dark cave was a heart-stopping thrill. It was a world where hi-tech gizmo's didn't make men fly, except in an always-unreliable prop plane.His was an old-fashioned swagger. The crooked smile didn't need to be straightened then, and now the wrinkles don't need to be Botoxed beyond all recognition because Indy was, is, human.There is only one modern-day equivalent that comes to mind: Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, who belongs to the same scruff-of-the-neck, spur-of-the-moment, in-the-nick-of-time school of lunacy as Indy. Who is better? The heart says Indy; the mind says Captain Jack  even for a viewer for whom Indiana Jones represents one of the first unforgettable trips to the movie hall, for whom the first bars of the classic theme song bring back a rush of a different time, a different place, a different magic.So where does that leave a young viewer, the one whose first brush with action was The Matrix? Will she be able to understand the delicious irony when Indy tells Mutt that he has brought a knife to a gunfight? Will she understand how special it is to see Spielberg return to the screen not only with Indy, but with some silly-looking old-school aliens? Chances are, she won't. Even if you switch off the cellphone, forget the Xbox and erase all memory of 2 Fast 2 Furious, she won't understand why this film was made. It is like comparing a Pierce Brosnan Bond flick to a Sean Connery one. She might even think to herself that Crystal Skull was fun, but wasn't it a little like National Treasure 2? And that would be a tragedy indeed.Is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  which seems destined to be followed by a long-planned Part V  a brilliant movie? Far from it. But then, were any of the Indy films? Spielberg is far too shrewd to change the nature of Indy, to make it cinema with more than half a brain. Just like he would never alter his script to suit his star. So if Cate Blanchett's death-eyed Irina Spalko seems flat, it is because she is supposed to be. An Indy villain was never too interesting, and definitely not believable (remember Amrish Puri's appalling Mola Ram?). And a Russian in 1950s America that is seeing the Reds everywhere could only be the comical, heavily-accented caricature that Blanchett plays to perfection. She knew she wasn't signing up for another Oscar nomination. If anything, the political incorrectness of a cardboard cutout baddie is an Indy tradition she would willingly participate in.The film does have character  tonnes of it  but don't go looking for it anywhere else but under that familiar, worn, brown fedora. Yes, Karen Allen's Marion lights up the screen with her warmth once again; Mutt's bristling machismo begs to be loved; but to give them too much more to work with would be to distract from what the film is really about  Indy getting back together with Ford, Spielberg and Lucas for another glorious, impossible romp.The film looks the same as it did 19 years ago, a minor miracle given how far technology has taken us, and it sounds the same too. Forget Elvis, whose Hound Dog turns the clock forward to 1957 in the opening scene. As the unmistakable bars of Indy's music play, it all comes back with a rush of affection.And that is what an old fan would leave with  not admiration, not awe, not respect, but a fond remembrance of past adventures and a smile on the face to see that Indiana Jones has done it again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1282,emkayz_rule,NOt exactly what I expected.... but good.,6,22 May 2008,"Let me begin by saying that the directing, CGI, stunts, acting, and above all music are impeccable.HOWEVER (notice the capitals), the plot and resolution of this movie are so WEAK in terms of what I expected I was more stunned than anything else when I watched this movie(and not in a good way).I loved all the original Indiana Jones, even the Temple of Doom. This movie is not an ""Indiana Jones"" movie. It is a crazy sci-fi adventure movie with Indiana Jones as the main character! PLEASE Do not get me wrong! This is a good movie. GO SEE IT! The only reason I gave it 6/10 is because it is not the Indiana Jones I've known and loved since my childhood. Shia does an excellent job. All other actors and actresses do very well. And, of course, Harrison Ford is at his usual awsomeness.I just couldn't get past the fact that this is Indiana Jones we're talking about, not some X-Files/treasure hunt thing.Go watch this movie with a completely open mind and you'll enjoy it immensely.

1283,info-16314,Saturday Morning Adventure... but with something missing,6,24 May 2008,"Like many I was eager to see the new Indy movie although I did go in there with my reservations after seeing the first publicity stills. I'll start with the negative points first.There had been comments that Harrison had become Indy again the instant he put on the hat. Sadly, as much as I love Harrison, I feel that this was just not the case. While still agile, he has unfortunately been unable to recreate the same range of facial expressions and comic timing that we all know and love. In fact throughout the whole of the movie I felt that there was only one classic 'Indy moment' (the one shown in the trailer).Secondly, I feel that Indy has always worked better when dealing with religious artifacts, he's an archaeologist after all. This movie took him into an uncomfortable realm that I feel didn't sit well at all with the Indy character. It was as though I was watching two separate movies that didn't quite gel.Thirdly, some of the CGI was dismal, giving the characters superhuman abilities that really weren't necessary and were quite laughable at times.My final gripe is that if ever George Lucas suggests putting cute creatures into a movie again, lock him into a room full of ewoks to make him think about what he has said (then again, that's probably not a punishment for him).On the positive side, this movie is fairly fast paced and entertaining throughout. I have to commend Karen Allen on keeping the character traits of Marion intact after all this time and for turning in one of the liveliest performances of the film.There are also some nice moments between Indy & Marion. Shia performs reasonably in his role although star quality doesn't leap off the screen in the way that it did for Harrison in his earlier movies.Don't have too many expectations when you go to see this, just enjoy it for what it is and you won't be too disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The opening scene with the cars and the trucks was very Indiana Jones and I was excited. Then as the movie progressed I slowly started to cry at what Indiana Jones had become.There was no good one liners that Indy was famous for, Shia LeBouf had some crazy swinging on vines scene which made no sense and my biggest complaint of all; WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BRING ALIENS IN STEVEN? CLOSE OF ENCOUNTERS OF A THIRD KIND IS A SEPARATE MOVIE! JUST LEAVE THEM OUT OF THIS! AND EVEN IF YOU ARE GOING TO PUT ALIENS INTO IT, DON'T MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE SKELETONS OF THE ALIENS FROM THE ALIENS SERIES.The overall film was good but they did too much and ruined Indy.

Plot holes and lapses in reality are allowed if it keeps things rolling along. This is a fantasy so the fantastic is okay.Two days on from seeing the latest Indy I'm looking forward to seeing it again this week. It has lots of action, lots of laughs and lots of great stunts.Some people have expressed unhappiness that it wasn't ""big"" enough or amazing enough. Well, I think it was all the more amazing given that there are relatively few digital effects and most of the stunts were done in real time.George and Steve have done a good job of giving us what we want while also letting Indy age and not just be a cardboard cut-out mimicking his past.I'm in my forties and my son is seven. I wasn't sure if he'd like it as much as Narnia but at one point my son jumped out of his seat and shouted to anyone who wanted to hear him, ""This is SOO exciting!""

Its a good movie, even without the knowledge or expectation of the previous movies.But as a fan of the previous three movies, I can't help but have this sense of dissatisfaction after watching the Crystal Skull.The movie had excellent acting (I was impressed by LaBeouf, and Ford never lets me down), excellent effects, excellent music, and it had the intense ""mood"" that made Indiana Jones movies so great, and Mr. Spielberg definitely did an awesome job in making the movie as it is. I've read people's reviews about how this movie was ""too cheesy,"" and it maybe so, but I would also like to argue that that's what make Indiana Jones movies so great and memorable.But if there were two downsides to the movie, they were the dialogue and the story. The script was good, but I felt that it did not meet up to the witty, funny, and sometimes (or often) cheesy dialogues that made the previous movies so memorable and fun to watch. Also, the movie had a fascinating story, but the end was too far fetched and over-the-top for my image (and expectation) of a Indiana Jones movie. The premise of the story was still the exciting, romantic mystery that was seen in the older movies, but the Crystal Skull went ""too far"" that it lost a sort of ""credibility"" of the movie. The two downsides are the only reason why I do not give this movie an easy 9 (10 and 9.5 are reserved for Raiders and Last Crusade respectively). I love the Indiana Jones series from the bottom of my heart, and that is especially why I cannot lie to myself (or to you) that this movie reached the quality of the previous movies. Its a good and enjoyable movie, but not excellent or great. However that does not stop me from suggesting everybody to watch this movie in theater, and neither does it stop me from looking forward for a possible sequel.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I felt almost numb watching this movie as it was so devoid of any of the traditional Indy movie thrills and spills. The plot was laughable and felt really (badly) contrived. Really this was all they could come up with after an absence of nearly 20 years? Lucas / Spielberg you owe me (and everyone else) a refund and compensation for 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Thanks for destroying another cherished childhood icon, the Star Wars prequels should have been evidence enough that Lucas lost his mojo long ago.If you were a fan of the originals, avoid this one.

It is still my favorite movie of all time and still is a great watch! So, I definitely had high hopes for this movie.What I witnessed was a horrible, horrible, movie. I wanted to like it soooo much, but I couldn't stomach this movie no matter how hard I tried to force it down my throat. There are so many reasons why, clearly laid out by other articulate IMDb users, that I won't even bother to elaborate on the details. The movie is just all wrong. Even Indiana Jones the character seemed kind of wimpy, in attitude and demeanor, and was a major disappointment. It was the way he was written, and not Harrison Ford's acting, as none of the good actors in this movie could create magic out of this dog's breakfast. I don't want to see this movie ever again, and if you must see it, you must, but I strongly urge you to stay away and keep your good Indy memories unmolested and intact. This movie is stinky! George Lucas once had a well of talent, but that well has dried up and he is a barren desert of ineptitude. He is so sucked up into his own head he doesn't even know what is good or bad anymore, and the sycophants surrounding him won't tell him either.

1291,papastrony,Disappointment of the summer,4,25 May 2008,"I have never been as disappointed walking out of the theater as I was today. There are certainly worse films however Indiana Jones is a classic adventure institution and this horrible film isn't even in the same league as the first three. Every fan going into this was extremely excited b/c the Indy trilogy films deliver-a believable tough guy who doesn't need to be a superhero; great action; enough humor to keep everything moving along; plus evil villains easily detested. This film lacks pretty much all of the above. We didn't care that they waited 20 yrs to make this or that Ford could be your grandpa; those details really wouldn't have mattered at all if this wasn't such a piece of cheesy sell-out garbage. Ford does well here after the first 10 minutes of the film in which his acting his horrific (not to mention soldiers unable to shoot him with machine guns standing 3 feet away from him). Shia LaBeouf actually is quite good too although only teenage girls can see him as a true tough guy-give us a break here. Karen Allen could kick the hell out of him. No: the real gut punchers here are the enormous ends Spielberg and crew go to make things as unrealistic as possible. During an atom bomb testing; Indy is saved by hiding in a fridge. OK; this is plausible but not until the fridge is blow several miles away and he walks right out unscathed. Then there are the waterfalls they must traverse...I know what you are thinking and I too-in ""Doom"" he escapes a plane crash in a raft and then tubes down a mountain of snow. Understood; however these are one and done; in this film the over the top acts continue until you want to literally heckle the screen. Did I mention Aliens? No not yet-even this would be OK and provide intrigue to the story however the final 10 minutes of the film are so outrageously cheesy they top it all off with a flying saucer leaving the temple sight. Blanchett's commie bad guy role is laughable-we all know and love the slimy Nazis and the Doom temple leader who pulls out your heart; this antagonist couldn't frighten my 5 yr old son. Way to go Hollywood and Spielberg; thankfully the DVD trilogy already exists so true fans aren't forced to purchase this crap.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1292,gnr008-3,"More fun, courtesy of Doctor Jones",9,28 May 2008,"I've read a lot, and I mean a lot of ridiculous reviews of the new Indy movie. Has everyone forgotten what Indy stands for? When you go to see an Indiana Jones movie you should expect to go on a hell of a ride. That is exactly what this movie does. To expect Oscar gold is just plan stupid. I know its the most anticipated sequel since the Phantom Menace but unlike that movie, I got exactly what I expected. Spielberg and Lucus delivered a really fun summer movie.It was great to see Harrison back in the fedora. He did not miss a beat, fitting back into the character like a beloved worn leather jacket. Shia LaBeouf did a good job as short round part two. His character does grow on you as the movie throttles forward. Karen Allen is back as Marian Ravenwood. Witch is a blessing after the screaming Cate Capshaw. Cate Blanchett rounds out the cast and does a god job as an evil Soviet ""doctor"". Like I said earlier the movie is a thrill ride. The well choreographed chase scene's may at times seem a little unbelievable, but who cares Its Indianna Jones! All of the other movies are just as unbelievable. The truck chase in raiders, the mine cars in temple and the tank in crusade are just as ridiculous, but thats why we love Indy. There is one particularly good motorcycle chase with Indy and Shia's character Mutt. Finally the aliens. I've heard nothing but the aliens make a shaky plot. To that I say, Indianna Jones is not the Godfather. No, the plot is not flawless, but none of the Indys plots are flawless. Like the killer ghost in the arch is more plausible than aliens helping Mayans build a lost city. People don't see Indy with E.T. but, there is no reason they shouldn't. It fits the action packed, supernatural theme of all of the other movies. Its really not a stretch.

So oh yeah it is packed with actions and adventures. Harrison Ford is back as Indiana Jones and the film was not affected all by his age factor. The store, background, characters everything was handled perfectly to give the audience the impression of real Indiana Jones.But! Too much special effect!! i hated that! specially those aliens! here it could've been something better. and that alien skull! looked like a toy to me. They could've come with better things i guess. And the scene where Jones flew in a fridge - was fun but too much. Again at the end when the aliens were taking off and the rocks were flying all over the mountain - that scene looked funny too.

And yes, I feel it lives up to the other titles in the series and would at least put it over Temple of Doom. Okay, you have to suspend your disbelief in watching this movie...but didn't you have to with every Indy film? Who can honestly say the part at the end with the Ark in the first movie was believable? Anyone? Should I even bother getting into the other two movies on the issue of believability? And that is my recommendation when watching this film. Don't try to take it so seriously and if you get your expectations too high, they'll never get lived up to, as many reviews here have proved to me.

The movie was so bad, I am not wasting time writing its full title. Frankly, I am in total shock. This sequel seems more like it was produced by a totally different team of filmmakers who just did their best to copy Lucas and Spielberg's style.I understand there is always a supernatural element to all the Indiana Jones films, but supernatural can be written well. I cannot imagine how test audiences gave their approval to this. I was insulted. I, honestly, only truly favor Raiders of the Lost Ark. Temple of Doom and Last Crusade were tolerable. This one was just bad.The only thing good in the movie was the quality of the special effects. Many years ago, George Lucas said in an interview that special effects cannot BE the movie.

What's with the picture and memorial moment? Was that really necessary? The villains were not strongly portrayed. They didn't have enough lines nor were the lines the had that good. They could have concentrated on the legend a bit more. There wasn't as much treasure hunting in this movie as there had been in the others. There was, however, plenty of action throughout the film.

Sadly, there was nothing to figure out, the plot was just so thin that the director felt okay with adding random crap that added nothing to the plot. Much like CSI:Miami is to the CSI:, the only thing this has in common with the original is the title. The action is lame, the acting is terrible, the plot is weak and the accuracy is ridiculous. This is why you should study history, because movies like this destroy it (for evidence, review the Goofs section) All in all, this was a supreme disappointment and I feel let down most of all by the reviewers on IMDb who have this at a 7 which is one of the reasons I saw this movie. This is proof positive that movie goers have lost their collective mind. This is nearly a B movie it's so bad, save your money, rent the DVD or better yet find someone else that rented the movie and stop by their house to watch it with them for free like Costanza does in Seinfeld.

The action in this movie is it's best piece. The jeep chase sequence was incredible. The chase at area 51 was great. Everything was all pulled off to make it a typical Indiana Jones sequel. But it's no Indiana Jones movie, if it were; there wouldn't be deficient direction. Steven Spielberg fell off the swing in this movie. The script is vulgar, but the good actors make it sound enhanced. But the ant attack kind of copies the bug attack thing off the Mummy. And fantasies go way over undomesticated in this. The UFO, the aliens, you know it's just mythological, and it's all very peculiar history involving Aztec stuff. But Steven decided to create a Mummy meets Temple of Doom thing, with Bizarro stuff happening. When special effects is the main part of this gala. But alike most of Stephen Sommers movies, some of the visuals are terrible. Like the Gofers out in the middle of the desert, did they even try with that? Those random mesa American natives popping out of nowhere near the end. It's cyclic with never-ending ideas of escapade. And the knowledge is fitting. The acting was all right. Most did defectively, others. Specifically the leads pulled off a high winner. But after 19 years of looking for a good-enough story, they come up with an idea that's just way too surreal. That's the only thing I have with this movie. Besides that, it has some good lines, like my favorite one: ""Don't just sit there and find something to fight with. "" Or the scene when Marion and Indy got sucked up in the sand pit. Or the cheep chase sequence, there were some funny spots their. This movie is occasionally admirable.

The visual effects used are not entirely necessary, but they are adjusted to the kind of situation that Indiana would often face; they do not represent any major disturbance in the force. It is really worth watching, specially if you grew up watching Indiana solving some century-old riddles.

1310,chrisinsanfran,Wasted opportunity!!! WHY?!,3,14 June 2008,"50s fine, Shia fine, aliens fine... script NOT fine. Only an idiot would think this script is good. Marketable and money-safe are more like it. Set pieces, young character, return of old cast members, high nostalgia nods... all make for passing entertainment and certain box office success (under the brand name of Indiana Jones), but this script is CRAP. Geroge Lucas RETIRE or give your original creations to other talented people and stay the hell away from the creative process... YOU ARE NO LONGER TALENTED! Your judgment and taste are gone... the death ring for all artist. You are a marketing man with some fair set piece ideas and a good visual sense, but in every other way you are retarded.Harrison Ford looks great and what a great cast... WHY NOT A GREAT SCRIPT to match. A flushed out story with characterization and suspenseful, dangerous scenes, witty dialogue... NOT set pieces glued together with walking through them... NOT stupid hokey cheesy dialogue (Marion Ravenwood was reduced to the Jar-Jar of this story)... NOT detached/theater-style/sitcom directing... not CGI over the top, embarrassing action... 19 years of waiting and they give us mediocrity... all under the guise of ""made for us boys and girls."" Well screw your patronizing us! We're not stupid out here and when you treat us this way we stop seeing your lame movies and watch cool ones instead.Oh what could have been!! Retire George!

What I saw took me back into the memories and the feelings I had when I watched the ""oldies"".I had fun watching it, as I always have when I re-watch each and every one of them.

It is WAY better than most summer blockbusters (Transformers, Spiderman, etc.) and it doesn't disappoint unless you expect it to be better than its past installments.

Shia does good too, and I usually hate his stuff, but hey, he pulled this one off...

It's like Spielberg directed the first half and Lucas directed the second.The plot (however non-Indy it may appear) did not bother me. It was simply the execution of the idea. Too much CG for over the top action scenes, simple as that.Both Spielberg and Lucas should find a tomb and lay there for a while 'cos quite a few people want their blood.

1314,acorvey,A wink and a nod...,7,24 May 2008,"""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a great piece of entertainment that manages to capture the spirit of the original trilogy. It may not be a perfect film, but it is by no means a failure.The major flaws all derive from David Koepp's screenplay: the narrative leans too hard on the formula established in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (and recycled to great effect in ""The Last Crusade"") and at times is overly contrived. The dialog is generic and lacks the spark and wit of the original films. The power and significance of the Crystal Skull is poorly defined, as are the stakes. The supporting characters are given little to do, and are often reduced to plot devices (especially Mac and Oxley).The direction, production design, editing and score are all superb. The cinematography is solid, though at times feels over-lit and sterile. The costumes are too clean and rarely appear to be lived-in.The action sequences are fun and inventive. Spielberg proves once again that he is a technical virtuoso with an innate understanding of the mechanics of cinema. The ""Hanger 51/Rocket Sled/Doomtown"" sequence is exhilarating and approaches the quality of the set pieces found in the original films.""The Jungle Chase"" is ridiculously fun and exciting despite an over abundance of CGI.The performances are strong across the board. Ford is right at home as Indy, and proves once again that he is a bona fide movie star. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly good as Indy's sidekick Mutt and Cate Blanchett is devilishly fun as Colonel-Doctor Irina Spalko.The biggest disappointment is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, whose presence is little more than a walk-on cameo. She has some great moments with Ford, though her involvement in the action is much less than I would have liked.The film ends with a wink and a nod, as it should. A sly gesture meant to remind the audience that what they just witnessed was all in the name of fun.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Poorly written, poorly cast, boring, predictable, and just plain ridiculous in some parts(Mutt swinging in the trees with monkey mates!?), I do not think this movie is worth the price of a ticket.

This was, the worst movie ever made, it ruined the entire saga. I will give you, temple of doom was pretty bad, but it was amazing compared to this movie. This makes Plan 9 from outer space look like Citizen Kane.Let me give you what was wrong with this movie. There was no continuity, the entire plot made no sense. It borrowed from every movie ever made, improperly and was just completely ridiculous.The best part of this film was when it said Lucas film in the beginning.Let me list some stolen parts of this movie. The gopher, from Caddyshack; the ark from raiders of the lost Ark, the ridiculous plot from Temple of Doom; The terribleness from War Of the worlds; the vine swinging fro Tarzan; the fact that in the A team they shot thousands of bullets but never get hit.This movie had zero suspense. Even a waterfall is boring in this movie. I have felt more excitement watching popcorn in my microwave.Let's talk about Harrison Ford in this movie. Every action bit he had, was slowed down so he could make a comment on the scene. The first half of the movie just made fun of him being old. It wasn't cute it was just annoying.Steven Spielberg has pulled a Francis Ford Coppola, he can no longer make good movies.

1317,silent_town,Enjoyable if you go in with no expectations,7,26 May 2008,"'Raiders' is the iconic action-adventure movie, and it and its two sequels form a geeky holy trilogy. If you're expecting 'Crystal Skull' to live up to the these movies, you're going to want your money back. That said, the movie is still enjoyable and fun and genuinely Indy. I'm not saying, ""go in with low expectations."" That implies the movie is a waste of celluloid, and this isn't. This is a new breed of Indiana Jones, a different flavor, and that flavor is digital. Even though this was shot on film, and there are a myriad of practical effects in this, it still feels digital. I certainly have gotten over my qualms with the 'digital revolution,' if you want to call it that, and have learned to enjoy movies that look green-screened. Besides this, there are moments here and there that stick out as hokey, but I think you could find one or two of those moments in any Indy movie. It's just that in here they stick out like a sore thumb because of how stupid they are (George Lucas levels of stupid).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

But there are certain red lines you can not cross, because Indiana is supposed to be a human and we are always in suspense about what could happen to him. He dodges bullets, runs wagons over lava, passes God's tests, because he is witty, brave and lucky. NOT because nothing can harm him. That's another hero, I believe his name is Superman.As soon as he survives the explosion, the movie is ruined for me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1320,hawsman2,Simply Exciting,9,22 May 2008,"Well Dare I say it, I think this is the best Indiana Jones movie out of the whole series! I went and saw all the Indiana Jones movies in a prequel marathon before I saw the premiere of this one, and I was blown away. The movie doesn't deserve a perfect ten, but it's pretty much just shy of it. The story and the atmosphere of the movie were absolutely in sync with the rest of the series. The characters stayed true throughout the movie and didn't let you get tired of them or seem to get cliché'd. The adventure was non-stop and gave you little chance to rest (in true style of the genre).I remember saying to myself while watching through all the action ""Wow... I'm actually excited!"". The movie doesn't just entertain you but seems to suck you in.That being said, there are reasons the movie lacks a 10. Harrison Ford hit his lines perfectly 90% of the time, but that 10% is kinda noticeable. The same goes for some of the other actors. The series has always had some supernatural undertone to it, but this movie goes a bit beyond the norm and (sometimes) felt the plot was being stretched. And for the love of god... they brought back Mary. Lord help me did I ever despise her.Unfortunately, the minor infractions added up and so I docked it a point, giving this movie a 9 out of 10.

1321,raccioly,"Unfortunately, good intentions won't necessarily spawn a good movie",2,23 May 2008,"This movie is really awful. I mean, the first two were escapist fun and all, but really, really good. They had stories to tell, even if not exactly Nobel Prize worthy, and I left the theater satisfied. The third, though not as good, was enjoyable too. This new installment feels completely empty. It doesn't feel like a movie, it's more of a slide show, if you get my drift. The scenes seem scattered, everything feels rushed, there's never enough time for the story to gather any momentum, no character development whatsoever... I could go on and on, but I think I've already made my point. (SPOILER AHEAD)****SPOILER**** Maybe it's just me, but they introduce Indy's SON in this movie, for Pete's sake! He should have been fleshed out a little better, IMHO. I would've liked to watch a short intro, showing a little more about what happened to the characters between this movie and the last. ****SPOILER END****Each and every character in the movie is paper thin; the new ones just stereotypes, the old ones shadows of their former incarnations. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but this was a MAJOR disappointment. As written above, the other movies, especially the first two, made us leave the theater feeling satisfied. This one has no substance, it's just a series of scenes that don't ever seem to connect into a coherent whole. If I was to summarize this movie in one word, it would be ""unsatisfying"". I guess they were trying to please us fans, giving us a new Indiana Jones movie and telling us a thrilling new story, but the end product feels half-hearted. Too bad...

However the storyline cripple the movie along with the franchise.Spoilers Aliens? Really? That's the best the creative team of Indiana Jones could come up with? Is that the next ""logical"" step to introduce Indiana Jones to the 21rst century? Isn't Star Wars got enough aliens as it is? Speaking of Star Wars, Lucas manage to ""revisit"" scenes from Return of the Jedi (battle of Endor) in the form of the Brazilian car chase throughout the jungle in which, Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett square of in a sword fight and then LaBeouf with the help of an army of monkeys (I kid you not) manage to retrieve the skull from Blanchett. Damn Ewoks! Although the Ark of the Covenant is shown during the first few minutes of the film the introduction of the alien life-form manage to p!ss on the whole concept of spiritualism and divinity of the prequels.I can't wait for Lucas and Spielberg to make another installment of Jaws. This time it is revealed that the giant sharks are weapons made by aliens from Atlantis (I will suspect they'll look like Jar Jar Binks) in order to claim the seas from humans.

1323,cramerg2000,"Yes, it's as bad as the Star Wars prequels",5,23 May 2008,"I was so hyped before seeing this movie. I watched the original trilogy as preparation, and loved every minute of it, even Temple of Doom, my least favorite. Then I headed to the theater to see this one... it's just total garbage. And as a huge Indy fan, I say this with deepest regrets.Don't worry about Harrison Ford's age; that's not the problem. No, the problem is the style of special effects Lucas came up with. It's very obvious that this is the same man that was behind the Star Wars prequels. My main criticism is the overuse of CGI. EVERY SINGLE ACTION SHOT in the movie is overloaded with overly-stylized CGI which make everything look like something concocted for a fancy big-budget movie set, not a plausible scenario someone would actually be able to fight their way out of. Many scenes try to be entertaining by being just plain silly... remember C-3PO's head being switched with that of a battle droid in Star Wars: Episode 2? Remember how just plain silly and stupid it was? Nearly all action scenes in this movie are like that. Inevitably, there will somehow be people in your theater who will laugh at all the silliness. I assume these people either have 2-digit IQ's or simply do not recognize the added levels of sophistication and plausibility in the original Indy movies.Oh, and the story is awful, too. Frequently, Indy will randomly solve some really hard puzzle by remembering some extremely obscure fact or by using a language that's been dead for hundreds of years. In this way, it's exactly like National Treasure or the Da Vinci Code.I've read lots of negative reviews for this movie, so I came in with low expectations... yet amazingly I still managed to be disappointed. I know the fanboys (like me) will come to see it no matter what the reviews say.

1325,btweensunandmoon,Entertaining but not Indy,5,1 June 2008,"There are 2 ways to look at this movie. Those being on its own and then compared with the previous entries in the franchise. On its own, it was an entertaining popcorn flick, along the lines of a National Treasure type movie. It was worth the price of admission but definitely doesn't merit a revisit to the theater or a rush to the store when it comes out on DVD. It was just your average ordinary summer blockbuster movie.However, this is Indiana Jones we are talking about and a movie with such a lineage behind it must be critiqued on its ability to hold up its end of the bargain in the series. I was lulled into a false sense of security with this movie beforehand for 2 reasons. 1) George Lucas learned his lessons with Star Wars episodes #1 & #2 and gave us a fitting Star Wars movie for #3 and 2) Steven Spielberg was directing. I felt confident that the great man Spielberg couldn't possibly let this movie turn into another Star Wars episode #1 debacle. I assumed wrong on both accounts.What we got was the Indiana Jones version of episode #1. Firstly, a big fault of the movie was the extremely long running opening action sequence. While previous Jones movies kept this sequence relatively short and to the point, this ran long and really hurt the rest of the movie. The nuclear blast scene following this was not needed and serves to not further the plot in any way. As a result of many wasted minutes, the rest of the movie seemed rushed. Characters and character relationships were not adequately developed. The pacing was fast to keep the film at 2 hours. This film could have done much better with about 30 more minutes.Let's face it. Harrison Ford was too old for this part. Nothing seems more out of place than a 65 year old man beating a well built younger Soviet officer in a fist fight. There were several other instances of realism issues. They were rampant also in the #2 and #3 movies in this series but those at least were dramatic. These were silly and bordering on ridiculous. In real life, all the characters would have been killed instantly from the tumble over the first waterfall, nevermind surviving 3 in a row.Spalko was miscast and not a believable villain. Mutt worked well with what the script called for and Marion needed some better script treatment. Lots of misplaced humor and not a dramatic movie by any stretch. Lots of Lucas trademarks. Thank you George Lucas for getting our hopes up and then dashing them.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1327,demarkin,Retirement Parties are ALWAYS SAD!,3,4 January 2009,"To Steven Spielberg and George Lucas --I had to give your film a second chance (as the first time I saw it in theaters , my friend talked throughout the entire film) . As per the second viewing, I came to the following understandings. The film is based too much off of the good times that once were... and the sad times that now exist throughout the Hollywood Film Industry. I am convinced that Hollywood takes cinematic geniuses and loads them up with too high-budget of financial compensation to where the prodigy's that once were are overtaken by whatever conglomerates foresee blockbuster expectations.I do not relate this movie to your first three successes. It is more of a high-budget retirement party than a good film. Congratulations -- if that is what you wish to achieve.From an editors standpoint, the movie is clouded with more-than-necessary CG than a plot. Indiana Jone's quality in the past was his willingness to sleep with a member of the Nazi regime because she was hot -or- his former fling of the past in order to accomplish his own purpose. Forgive the Jack Daniels, but it speaks the truth. The next time you produce/direct a movie - do it for your own vision rather than for a demographic. You lost the faith in many people. To Harrison Ford -- You have great abilities. Your talent in the past has always been entertaining. In the future, read the script before you commit to it.Thanks all! And better luck in future endeavors! To George Lucas Only -- CG doesn't mean better! Particularly when a plot-line lacks! (eg- Last 3 of Star Wars!

1328,aaproductions07,"Indy is Back, in a NEW Era of Adventure!",8,24 May 2008,"I grew up with these Indy films. The only one I saw in theatres before was ""The Last Crusade"", the others I grew up with VHS. And as a true Indy fan, I thought this was worth the 19 year wait.Many people have had mixed feelings about the latest installment of the Indiana Jones series, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. This was my personal review on the film, I share my pro's, but also some of my con's.I'm a die hard Indy fan, I loved all of the movies and I really liked this 4th movie! I didn't go in expecting a second coming of a great movie, I went in expecting a typical Indiana Jones movie and thats what I received. I thought it was fun, exciting, different (verrry different), and had classic Indy moments. Now, most people don't realize that this whole thing with the aliens...well it works very well. You have to understand that these movies are inspired by Saturday Matinée B Movies. The first 3 were in the 30's, when a time of supernatural adventure non-sense were seen in films of that era. Spielberg and Lucas captured that very well. Now, were in the 50's; the atomic age, red scare, and of course the dawn of Sci-Fi! We all know the reason why they chose the 50's as a new time setting, to match the age of Harrison Ford. The most popular entertaining film genre were Sci-fi alien flicks like: 'It Came From Outer Space', 'The Thing', and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'. I think it was smart of the filmmakers to try somethin NEW. New influences from this era of our history works for the movie. We received the classic alien look and ship, but stood to some truthes to the Mayan legends about how their civilization has been a lot more syphisticated than any other civilization, legends never the less. Stunts were great, Ford has proved that he's still got it as Indy. The filmmakers lacked in the CGI, which is good thing, but it was used in scenes that were needed, like the finale as an example. However CGI monkey's and prarie dogs were dumber than Jar Jar Binks in Episode I, I mean why couldn't we get real animals like that to be in the film? People have responded weirdly about about the frige scene and 3 water falls. Of course it unrealistic, but is it as realistic as Indy jumping out of a plane with an inflatable life raft and sliding down a mountin and runing threw a raging river safely and unharmed? I DON'T THINK SO! It's just a movie no one should overanalyze these things. As for the side characters in this film I think Shia LaBeouf did an impressive job, I was going in expecting him to stink up the movie with his constent ""No, no, no's!"", but he was pretty good as Mutt I don't see Shia taking over the series 'cause there's only ONE Indiana. It was nice to see Karen Allen again as Marion Ravenwood, she was an Indy fan delight to have in the movie, seeing a familiar face in a franchise like this is always nice (like John Rhys-Davies returning in 'Last Crusade'). Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko seemed goofy at times, but she was an OK villain with her Boris/Natasha accent. Now, the one thing that really bothered me with this movie was that there wasn't enough heart to heart time between Marion and Indy till the very end, they missed out on that from 'Raiders'.Anywho I feel that 'Skull' is the 3rd best in the series and without question it out beats 'Temple of Doom' hands down, but nothing will ever beat 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' not even 'Last Crusade'!

Sure there is so poor acting (as there is in any movie) but it holds up with great fun action humor and the classic acting of Harrison Ford as an older, more seasoned Indiana Jones.You need to take away your feelings from the originals and look at this movie for itself.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Raiders close behind, and I was introduced to Last Crusade late. Needless to say, I was a bit pumped for this movie, and couldn't wait to come back here to write a glowing review.And what a pin it was to pop that pumped up self of mine. From the beginning way too slow moving, frankly boring first scene (seriously, we had a giant boulder, crazy antics finding an antidote, and Indy as a kid...wheres that kinda opener here??) to the ridiculous alien conclusion, I found myself constantly wanting to give this movie a chance, but just being able to bring myself to.It doesn't even feel like an Indy movie. Harrison sits in a plain white shirt talking with some FBI agents. Thats something one sees in...every single other movie. Honestly. Did this search for the perfect script just stop on one that would be adequate? With the exception of half of a chase on a motorcycle and a sand part, the film is really uninspired. Take one of the bigger baddies. When Indy faces off against him amidst a ton of CG ants, all it consists of is them trading punches. The punches sound pretty impressive, but...thats all there is to it.That also brings me to the CG. We had some groundhogs in the beginning (first shot, in fact-UGHH!!!) to the ants to people to everything else. And it just felt disgusting. No danger felt at all. The huge car chase through the jungle was when I really got ready to go, but nothing at all happened. What happened to the brilliance that occurred in Raiders? I actually look forward to a sequel, just because I believe anything is an improvement over this dreck. Shia actually holds his own, and Harrison is great as always.

WHAT!!!!? Shia Lebuff is Indys SON!!!!!!!? WHAT!!!!? Naw I'm just kidding, if you didn't come to the conclusion that he was his son at least 10 seconds after he was introduced...then you have no insight and was probably entertained by the second half of this film. 8. The second half.The good stuff!1. The first half (minus the bomb scene). 2. The motorcycle chase scene. 3. The Area 51 scene. 4. Umm yeah thats about it. 5. Oh wait the nice CGI effects, which were at times too much, but the ending wash-out scene was beautiful I thought.Overall it entertained me, unwittingly. I wasn't surprised at any outcome, minus the FIRST time his friend turned on him, and the aliens, cause that is just ridic.! If it kept up what was going on the first half (once again minus the bomb scene) then it would have easily been a 7-8. But since it just went downhill...quickly and at a ginormous slope...the second half was at best a 4...but was kind of like a roller coaster of 1-4 lol. So I decided to include the first half since it is part of the movie and be nice to it...give it a 5, you are welcome Indy 4.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1333,kerrywba,Good - But no Last Crusade!!,8,25 May 2008,"Well on coming out of the cinema I must admit I was perplexed somewhat. I came out thinking it was like a cross between National Treasure and the X Files! The search for a City of Gold and the Alien contingent made this film feel like a million miles from the original Indiana Jones films - even so, it was enjoyable!! A few friends saw this before me and had said it was good but a little far-fetched, and I can only agree! Even though the first 3 films were somewhat far-fetched too, this one seemed more so. The quest for the Holy Grail compared to cross dimensional aliens! Also the fact that Indy survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge - a bit mad! A big disappointment for me was the bad guys - I loved it when Indy fought the Nazis - somehow the Russians didn't seem quite so formidable!! All in all a good film - Just don't go in hoping to compare it with previous Indy outings, because you may be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1334,jman11257,Shia Lebeouf and the phantom menace that is the new Jones flick,3,22 May 2008,"I am not usually hard on movies, Spiderman 3 disappointed me but I still didn't get mad about it. I take them for what they are, but every now an again there comes a film that I've been looking forward to that drives me to angrily rant about it on the internet like a twelve-yea-old virgin. Unfortunately this movie is just unbelievable. Almost the entire film looked like a silly cartoon, the effects were for the most part awful and unnecessary. An example would be the very beginning with the gophers and Indiana Jones surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge that bounces around like a basketball leaving him unharmed. Okay, in the other movies he does some ridiculous death defying acts, but this is pushing it and that is an understatement. Okay watching the movie hoping that just the beginning is that silly, but no. The only other action sequence in the entire film takes place in a jungle that looks completely CGI and fake. Adding to the surroundings looking very fake Shia Lebeouf begins to sword-fight a Colonel on top of a moving vehicle in a jungle. Okay, I was willing to let that slide even though it kind of made me want to vomit, but then Shia becomes one with nature and attacks Blanchett with his new army of monkeys he met in the trees. Shia and his monkeys some how catch up and are even faster then the moving vehicles and save the day only to then be attacked by man-eating ants, which I am assuming are army ants. Army ants to my recollection are only found in Australia, but whatever I could be wrong. The rest of the movie there is little peril just some weird CGI and alien garbage. To me it felt like Lucas, as he did in his newer star wars movies added a bunch of CGI animals that look really stupid and fake for whatever reason, I don't know perhaps CGI creatures give him a boner, but not me man. The movie sucked.VERY Disappointing!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1335,sixtyeight,A disappointment,6,7 October 2008,"It's been a long time since I wrote a comment about a movie here. And again a person called ""George Lucas"" is involved - coincidence? Here are lots of reasons AND SPOILERS why I didn't like the movie:* various overdone and illogic action sequences (Tarzan, waterfalls, etc). I think movie watchers today are not as forgiving as they have been 20 years ago (and even 20 years ago the lift raft scene in the old Indy movie was a bad joke). The warehouse scene in the beginning, where lots of armed Russions fail to shot slowly climbing Indy was one of the first spoiling the movie!* Quoting yourself can be entertaining, but can easily be overdosed, like in the ""Clone Wars"" animation series (Lucas again?).* Two times Indy comes up with previous mistranslations - that is not only boring, but also makes him and us look like idiots (Oh, it could also mean ""City of Wisdom"" - then let's stay home, skip that adventure (or movie and let's watch ""National Treasure"" again)).* All those cuts where they moved away the camera for only one reason, so you do not see that they replaced rheumatic Ford with a more agile double, were far too obvious.* Like with the new Star Wars movies there seems to be no time to tell a story. It's like a roller-coaster ride, not like a day at a theme park. Story - that must be that annoying stuff that is needed to glue together the action sequences.* Have you seen how they cut open the two ""mummies"" at the warehouse and graveyard, thrusting the blade deep inside first. No wonder all their Christmas presents are broken after they opened their gift-wrapped boxes (that way).* Why did adding skull No. 12 trigger some action that did not happen before the skull was removed and how could someone have removed that skull at all? Mysteries, oh, mysteries...So this movie fails in many aspects, story, filming, action. I think I will watch Stargate, The Mummy, National Treasure or even one of the Tomb Raider movies again, before I will watch this one again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1336,ninajdstj2000,Great Movie,10,1 June 2008,I know many people liked this film and many did not. I think it is the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was well written and it was not long and dragged out like many action adventure movies. It even had a touch of romance which as a woman I really enjoyed. I am a fan of Stargate the movie and TV show so the aliens did not bother me at all. This is the first movie I paid to go see twice and I would go again if given the chance. I encourage people who did not like it to go see it again or at least watch it when it comes out on DVD. There were thing I was confused about after only watching it once and I liked it even better the second time. Once again great movie and I hope they do a sequel.P.S. Harrison Ford looks hot for a man of 65.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1337,enforcer-56252,So much more could have been done.,7,21 January 2019,"The cast choice wasn't too bad, they all worked well together and made for a great lineup. The writing for this film seemed to try too hard to be edgy and new but came off being cheesy and at times uncomfortable for an Indiana Jones film. It was worth the watch but not something I would put on my top shelf of replayabe movies. This would have been the perfect placement to to boot into a new generation of Indiana Jones, it is too bad LaBeouf had such problems and will never continue the franchise.

1338,salvin,"Indiana Jones is back, in an already underrated adventure.",10,30 May 2008,"It's sad that Indy's fourth adventure is already underrated. It has received some undeserved badmouthing, and I can understand why. Aliens doesn't go with everybody. But as a die-hard Indiana Jones fan, and a firm believer that alien lifeforms have been here on earth a long time ago, I found ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" to be a one of the greatest cinematic experiences in a long time. Harrison Ford delivers everything he should as Indy, if not more. Shia Lebouf gives a funny performance as Mutt, a tougher Sam Witwicky. Karen Allen was great, Cate Blanchett was perhaps a bit silly, but a great villain non the less, in a cartoon kind of way. Ray Winstone and John Hurt are also great, but their parts could have been more developed, but as the great actors they are, they do a lot of funny things with such small parts. The movie has many wonderful comedic scenes, such as the funniest atomic explosion since ""Dr. Strangelove"", a motorcycle-ride inside a library, and Indy's latest phobia attack. The action sequences does feature some CGI, and those who are angered by this just don't get it, everything has to adopt to the new times. One of the best aspects of the movie, is nuclear family element of it all. Indy, Marion and Mutt work so great as a family, and Indy's parental skills reminds us of a certain Mr. Connery. It was everything a Indiana Jones movie should be, funny, emotional, exciting, cool, and entertaining as hell! I don't care what anybody says, Spielberg and Lucas has done it again! Welcome back Indy!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The stunts (Harrison Is Terrific on this), the gags, the fight scenes, the car chasing is the best of all Indy movies. I love this movie, aim not disappointed at all. And for those people who talk bad about this movie they were spec ting to see Raider Of The Lost Ark!!!! and.....damn... there will be not a movie close enough good as Raiders. If you go to see this movie spec ting something like Raiders....you will be disappointed.....but if go to enjoy one more Indiana Jones movie, spec ting to see how will be his final journey.

1340,IKillOmega,Wow. They didn't even try.,1,27 May 2008,"There are a lot of things wrong with this film. I know that the critics say crap like, ""A must see!"" and ""The summer blockbuster you've been waiting for!"" but I say, ""Watch any one of the many Indiana Jones wannabes and you are likely to see a better picture."" It's quite obvious Lucuss and Spewburg weren't sure who to market this to. In one scene Shai LeBouff (probably misspelled, but I don't care) is swinging through the jungle with monkeys and that is followed by a guy being sucked into a hole by ravenous ants (all very PG-13 of course). The film is tamer and weaker than any of the previous films, each of which had a good plot in which Indy must attain some artifact in order to save the world from the ones who want to control its power. Thus is the case here as well, but the plot lacks any Historical or cultural value and, instead, tries to hook audiences through cheap thrills like Indy narrowly surviving an Atomic Explosion.All of the chases and action scenes in the movie are strictly by-the-book. There is not one original action scene in this entire film. Everything except the ending (which I won't spoil) was predictable. However, the ""twist?"" ending is so lame and stupid that it completely strips the Indiana Jones franchise of any credibility.The saddest thing is is that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull turns out like just another Indiana Jones wannabe, with the added feature of actually HAVING Indiana Jones in it. To me it is no better than the Mummy movies, the Tomb Raider films, National Treasure, and (shutter) The Librarian: the Quest for the Spear. I recognize that some of those movies where ""okay"" but they do not measure up to what the are trying to emulate, and neither does Indy 4. Save your money. Buy the new DVD box set of the original Trilogy and enjoy cinematic greatness at home.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1341,valtoras,Disappointingly poor,3,26 May 2008,"The major fault with this film was there wasn't ""enough""of everything. There was not enough plot, even for an Indiana Jones film and that which there was we have seen many times before. There was not nearly enough character development, John Hurt was just a blabbering old fool, Ray Winstone might as well have not been in it and Jim Broadbent, blink and you'd miss him. The villains were not nearly villainous enough (and they had the Soviets to play with - haven't they seen Bond?) and Cate Blanchett just wasn't bad enough. The only thing there was too much of was special effects and cuddly CGI creatures (cue George Lucas). In essence this film was just weak in every way and not even the cult status saved it for me.My Indy DVD collection will be remaining a resolute three films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1342,dragonhunter200,Where are the rave reviews coming from?,1,26 May 2008,"As a big fan of the original three, I was incredibly excited and a little nervous to see this film. However, I remained open to changes in character development, etc.I knew nothing about the Crystal Skulls before seeing this movie, so the ending was slightly surprising. Halfway through, I began to fearfully predict the ending, but still had hope that they had better taste than to go in that direction. They didn't. I'm trying to avoid any spoilers, so I won't say what exactly happened, but I was incredibly disappointed by the cheesy ending. I have a number of other minor complaints but I think they are probably more personal in nature and may not bother others.I work at a movie theater and therefore hear many, many customer reviews. Between friends, family, and customers, I have honestly heard no positive reviews! Many people are neutral, thinking that it was nothing compared to the originals, but not a terrible movie overall. The rest were completely disappointed, much more than I was. But the critics seem to love it! Now, I recognize that I am not a professional critic, but I think I have pretty fair taste. I can't see what the critics see. I don't understand how this rather bad film can receive such positive reviews.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1343,aaron111,Contrary to popular belief this is not an Indiana Jones flick,4,23 May 2008,"It is with great sadness that I must report that the latest installment in the Indiana Jones franchise fits comfortably along side recent efforts such as The Mummy, National Treasure, and Pirates of the Caribbean but has very little resemblance - except when it comes to artificially forced fan service - to the original trilogy.Much has been said about the poor use of CGI in this film - and it rings true for me. It is not that the original films had excellent SFX in all cases (at least in terms of how they have stood the test of time) - but they had a hand made quality and authenticity - a feeling of real physicality that Spielberg promised would be back. From the opening scenes in which we have a comically double taking CG prairie dog, I knew there was going to be trouble. The onslaught of artificial visuals is relentless. A horde of CG ants appears that feels directly lifted from The Mummy (replace scarabs with giant red ants and you get the idea). A squad of ""comical"" CG attack monkeys comes to the aid of Shia in ridiculous Tarzan inspired scene. I could swear those are the same monkeys from Jumanji. One of the action center pieces, a jungle jeep chase (clearly trying to recreate the feel of the brilliant Raiders truck scene), felt as artificial as anything out of Pirates of the Caribbean - with equally confusing and jumbled choreography, lacking any real tension. The characters felt like they were in about as much danger as Willie E. Cyote and the Roadrunner. The only action scene that stands out for me is an old fashioned motorcycle chase that for a few shinning moments recaptures the feel of the originals with great stunt and camera work.Aside from the action, the story is absolutely atrocious. This will surly go down as the worst script that ever took 19 years to write. It is bursting at the seams with half developed and half aborted ideas. Even though I haven't read any of the now famous and infamous scripts that predate the development of the final product - it is obvious that dozens of different story lines have been trimmed, shaved down, rearranged and stitched together into this monstrous mess. The whole ""Chariots of the Gods"" concept that underlies the films could have been a great starting point - if they had only remembered to keep the mysticism and the mystery that characterized the originals. Alien ""gods"" visiting earth in ancient times is fine, but we don't need to see poorly rendered CG aliens and UFOs straight out of the X-Files franchise. Leave something to the imagination! In Raiders we didn't need to see a white bearded god reach down from a cloud to smite the Nazis. The lengthy warehouse scene in the beginning of the film seems designed solely to give us the sight gag of the Ark from Raiders revealed in a broken crate - no one in my screening so much as reacted. Once again all of the mystery is destroyed, nothing is left to the imagination. This is the work of amateurish screen writing combined with ham-fisted direction - pandering to and playing on fond memories 25 years gone.Most of the attempts at comedy fall flat. Particularly a ludicrous scene involving an obviously rubber snake used as a ""rope"" to pull Indy out of sand pit. The scene that got the biggest laugh out of my theater was when Indiana Jones survived an atomic blast by hiding inside a refrigerator. Perhaps this was meant to be funny, but that doesn't make it any less out of place. That is the kind of physics defying action set piece that belongs in Superman or the Fantastic 4, not Indiana Jones.I could go on about the wide assortment of useless characters, the completely un-menacing villain that is Kate Blanchett's character. I could go on for ages about just how deeply flawed and inane the story is; about how Karen Allen feels tacked on and how she doesn't seem to be able to act her way out of a paper bag anymore. I could tell you about how this film lacks any of the visceral appeal - the blood shed and moments of horror that gave the original films a hard edge. But mercifully, I will end my review here with a happy reflection on the fact that my DVDs of the original trilogy remain intact and George Lucas, try as he might, will never be able to revise them to fit into his modern, cynical, uninspired sensibility of commercial film making.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1344,Randal24,I blame George Lucas,6,24 May 2008,"Let me first start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the original Indiana Jones trilogy. That may have been the problem I had when I walked into the theater to see the fourth installment of the long dormant series...I had expectations. Almost all of the posters on this page have touched on many of the subjects I want to discuss, so I will make my comments brief.Each of the first three movies had some mystical element to them: 'Raiders' had the Ark, 'Temple' had the stones and the heart ripping scene and 'Crusade' had the Grail. However, and yes there is some debate on this, besides the mystical elements of the films displaying their power at the end of each movie (with the exception of Temple with the heart ripping scene in the middle) the movies stayed for the most part grounded in some sort of reality. You can argue in Temple that falling from a plane and landing on the ground using a raft was unbelievable...but the effects in this fourth film outweigh that scene 10 fold. My point here is that Spielberg did not follow his own proved formula of Indy success and the film suffered. I blame George Lucas.A nuclear explosion tosses Indy in a ""Fridge Coffin"" for miles and yet he survives. People argue that ""of course he would survive, he's Indiana Jones"". That's all well and good. Why do we even need that scene? There could have been something else, a different type of weapon, but a nuclear explosion? I understand why having a fifties reference was pertinent, but it could have been executed differently.Then we have the jeep chase scene and the infamous ""monkey swing"" segment. This is when the movie started cribbing from ""The Mummy"". I will be the first to admit that movies like ""The Mummy"" and ""National Treasure"" pay homage to Indiana Jones, but why does Spielberg decide to go as over the top as those films did? Why was the monkey swing scene necessary? Why did they have to incorporate all that CGI into the jeep scene? I feel like the chase scene could have been even better without unrealistic stunts. In some aspects, including the ant scene I will discuss below, the film felt a little like Jackson's ""King Kong"". I blame George Lucas.Next, the ants. Spielberg again diverted from his formula of using live insects or animals in each of the films (snakes, insects and rats) and instead turned to CGI. I blame George Lucas. This scene was cribbed from ""The Mummy"" (the scarabs). I really don't have to say much about it.Finally, the entire plot device of the film...Aliens. The first three Indiana Jones films were driven by a religious or spiritual plot device, the film diverted and instead was driven by aliens. Some may argue that the people that worshiped the Crystal skulls did so because of spiritual reasons, but it turns out, they were aliens. As the film progresses we see drawings and depictions of the aliens teaching humans how to build and farm...at this point the production hits a low when it is borrowing plot points from ""Alien vs. Predator"". I blame George Lucas.Why after 19 years did they resurrect the character and throw him in a movie with this plot? Spielberg veered from his own formula and created something more over the top than any of the three films. Two years ago during Comic Con Spielberg remarked that after the last Indiana Jones movie, he made many films for himself, but Indiana Jones 4 would be for the fans...if that is true, why didn't he stick with what the fans love? I blame George Lucas.Sure the film was entertaining to an extent and it will make tons of money. As an Indy film, it fell flat. Much like ""Die Hard 4"" this movie could have sat out there on its own as a generic action film, it just didn't feel like part of the series. I blame George Lucas. Ruin your own trilogy George, but don't ruin someone else's.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1346,essopappas,Pure Indy nostalgia,7,22 June 2008,"Crystal Scull is pure nostalgia and should be treated as such. Its not a stand-alone film, its not one more Indiana Jones epic, its a trip down memory lane for Messrs Spielberg and Lucas and all of us who got into the Indy business when we were like 10 or 15 year olds back then. As such its more or less perfect. Treating it like any other movie is missing the point, this wasn't even made, whatever their intentions, as a stand-alone film, its the appendix of the series and its a great one indeed. So its really an Indiana Jones - Lara Croft - Mummy etc etc pastiche, but that shouldn't subtract from the enjoyment, after all there would probably haven't been a Lara Croft (or a Mummy for that matter) without Indy...

Although the tone is campy and fantastical (somewhere between ""Last Crusade"" & ""Temple""), there aren't enough genuine laughs to back it up.

These were genre creating films that stood testament to the prowess of intelligent, creative film-making.This movie should not be considered a part 4, but as an impostor.Its child-like plot, its irrational circumstance, its sound-stage world, its lack of pace, neglect of tension, its wooden acting, its dumbed-down dialog, its dismissive characters, three awful over-the-waterfall scenes and that horrible Tarzan scene ensured that no emotion could be invested with the two-dimensional, lifeless characters.Where this movie created a world with the logic of a Looney Tunes cartoon, I sat as a mind-numbed spectator and not as an excited audience member.The popcorn was very good though. So good that I got up for seconds, and I am quite certain that I missed nothing when I left my seat.I made a mistake, I listened to the obviously paid-off critics that applauded this movie, I believed the hype; but who wouldn't?

Like Spielberg said- this film could have been shot a week after the last crusade. Its old style is great and it feels just like the old school Indy movies. Harrison ford is great and Mutt is just brilliant. Its an exciting movie and a good story. Ford doesn't look hugely different to how he did 19 years ago. There are jokes about his age, lots of witty one liners and a real sense of fun.The film is far fetched. But come on, in the last one Indy drank from the Holy Grail and saw a man age a hundred years in front of his eyes. Indy films ARE far fetched! I don't know what most reviewers are looking for! Cinematography, great directing, flawless story, unaged actors? In my opinion, if a film is ENJOYABLE then that is all that matters! And did I enjoy this? You betcha!

It has some very very good settings (as expected) I think what brings this movie down is the original concept itself, the crystal skull. The original movies all have an end goal that deals with some religion with a ton of other stuff adding on such as locations, characters and iconic moments/fight scenes. This one deals very little with religion, it has an interesting concept instead of one based on religion but although it's interesting at a glance it really really falls short compared to the others.Regardless it's worth watching but it won't beat the originals especially the last crusade which I think is peak indiana jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Area 51, men from mars, telekinetic beings from space, spaceships and inter-dimensional portals? I thought this was Indiana Jones. And It is. Only this time it's just too much. Although Harrison Ford got blessed with years, he still looks great on the screen (pants may be a bit soggy at times). So that at least is a relief. At some point in the movie though the thin story loses it's mystique and my initial awe became embarrassment. It seemed to me that the creators tried to include all the things that make Indy... well.. Indy, AND additionally to top all the previous instances in every aspect. And failed. There's only one scene I found remotely funny (""Grab the snake!""). Apart from that the actors just rush from one ridiculously unrealistic and therefore boring action sequence to another disregarding plot-holes and bad, bad acting. Seems the farther they get in the story, the faster they want to be just done with it. In the end it's just your next HAM (hollywood action movie; hey, I just created an acronym!) When it becomes clear that Indy is faced with beings from space I gave up and the movie lost me entirely.

And also it's a shame.Many people wrote comments about the errors of this movie that cannot be supported by the makers of the film, the implausible stunts and events and I agree with all of them.But there is still one thing I would like to hear George Lucas' explanation (if it would be possible) about: why does US Government conduct a nuclear test near a storehouse where invaluable artifacts (such as the Ark of the Covenant and other things) are stored??? Are US Army guys so retarded? Or rather the script writers? Indy escaped in the night from the bad guys, and arrived in the morning in the test village, so he could not have walked more than 10-15 km away.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1357,chris-743,Really enjoyable,9,24 May 2008,"There's an awful lot of criticism of this movie going about. I personally think it was brilliant at doing what it said on the tin i.e. being an action/adventure movie.The cast were very good and I think the film was paced correctly. Yes there were a couple of plot devices where a HUGE amount of poetic licence was needed but if you are going to see a movie like this then you shouldn't sit and dissect it after!!!! Stop the Moaning for God's Sake - it isn't supposed to be an Oscar Winning drama!!!!!!! Thoroughly enjoyable; not as good as Raiders (which is my favourite action movie) or Temple of Doom but MUCH better than Last Crusade.Harrison Ford is amazing as Indy still - I hope I'm that fit and healthy at 66!! Karen Allen and Shia are also superb.My advice - shut your mouth , stop moaning and enjoy it for what it is.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1358,schwiegs,Don't Waste Your Money,3,23 May 2008,"The Indiana Jones franchise is one that is near and dear to me. ""Raiders"" inspired me to become an archaeologist and I have enjoyed the original trilogy immensely over the years.So, it was with great sadness that I left at the end of ""Crystal Skull"" with anger in my voice and heart. Anger at the fact that script & plot was ridiculous and so poorly written. Anger at the fact the acting wasn't as good as previous films. Anger at the fact that the cinematography was poor and did not bring the realism of previous Indiana Jones films. Anger at the fact that this movie had been so anticipated by some many people and once again I was fooled by George Lucas into thinking he actually ISN'T totally out of touch with fans.I think the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes were true Indy moments, as well as the scenes of the car chase at the university. Other than that, this movie is one that you watch on TNT at 2am when you are sick and can't sleep. Even then, I'd be tempted to change the channel. It was like watching a B-movie imitation of Indy. This movie was lower on the scale than any of the original Indy knockoffs, ""The Mummy"", ""Tomb Raider"", ""The Librarian""...all of which I now have greater respect for because at least you knew how silly they would be.The movie jumped the shark for me when Indy is blow 2 miles away in a lead lined fridge by a nuclear explosion, and is perfectly fine. Game over right there. It just gets more ridiculous from there and culminates in....wait for it....aliens taking off in the middle of amazon from a Mayan temple. Yes, it's that bad a story.I know George Lucas clings to belief that his childhood memories of 1950's shorts and TV and film are what inspired him...well, it's easy to see that in this piece of crap. And that's probably why you can buy 50 Sci-Fi Movies from the 1950's in a pack for $20. Cause they are just THAT bad!Everyone who was involved in the making of this movie should be mocked in public for it being so craptastic.Seriously folks...save the $6-12 per ticket and use it to buy gas instead....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1359,krankor-5,Half Empty or Half Full?,5,14 October 2008,"If you never saw any of the other Indiana Jones films then you will probably enjoy this film. But if you have you will probably be disappointed like me. In the other films the bar was raised. First the bad stuff: Indiana survives a nuclear blast because he hid in a refrigerator? Magic alien skulls is the main plot (Is Harrison Ford suppose to be playing Indiana Jones or Agent Mulder from the X-Files?) Indiana having a son he never knew he had (like this hasn't been done to death! )Mind control? The list goes one! Any of the Indiana Jones Video games has a better plot that this!Now the good stuff: Indiana and Marion back together (and getting married) was awesome! The ""Snake Rope"" was very clever! A youthful character who wasn't smarter than the adults or a jerk was a pleasant change! Harrison Ford does another superb job of acting! This list could go on as well!These lists cancel each other out so this turns out to be a fair movie. If they worked some more on finding a decent plot and refining the characters it would have been a decent effort. I mean, after 18+ years the action sequences from the other movies still excite me. The ones from this movie bored me while I was watching it for the first time. In this end this is a decent rental film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1360,The Ultimate Sueff,A very nice addition to the franchise,8,2 June 2008,"After all this nitpicking I saw on this site I was very sceptical about this movie. After watching it I was very satisfied. Harrison Ford, Shia LeBeouf and Cate Blanchett (can I say, as always?) are very good in their roles and really keep the movie going. Although I could have lived without Ray Winstone's role as 'Mac' I have to say that the supporting cast also play their parts well, as you would expect from a Spielberg movie. Some spoilers ahead: I liked the overall story. It reminded me a bit of Stargate, which isn't bad in my book. The action sequences were great. I wasn't that fond of the beginning but after the university scenes the movie got rolling. Especially when Shia's character was starting the bar fight I got really dragged into the movie. The Bill Haley music and the motorcycle/car chase following the scene were awesome. Afterwards the movie's getting the usual Indy feel to it when they are climbing through spider-webbed caves and always getting in those situations where they did all the dirty work and the bad guys take advantage of that. The chase scene through the jungle (although the monkey scene was by no means necessary) was very good and I actually liked the giant ants at the end of that sequence. The ending scene was OK, but still a bit of a let-down since I was very pleased with nearly everything that happened before.All in all I would rate it on par with Temple of Doom which I also gave a 8/10 but worse than part 1 and 3 which I gave 9/10 (with Raiders being pretty close to my all-time favourites which would lead to a 10/10).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1361,duaplex,A Legend Dies....,7,23 May 2008,"I went to see this film last night and i really wanted to like it. I mean i tried very hard to stay away from reviews and close my ears to all the critics.When i arrived at the cinema i should have been suspicious that there were no queues, in fact there were only 2 people in the line with 10 minutes before seating left.So anyway on to the movie, and for those who have not seen this film do not read past this point. Bottom line is this film is far from the Indianna Jones genre that its unreal, there was absolutely no need to involve aliens in this film, we have enough History on earth to base the film on actual events or something that is believable. All 3 films before had a sold foundation, they were based on something we knew existed or even based on religions. This one stepped down the road of Alien Vs Predator. It had aliens that were worshipped whilst providing man kind with technology.Now i gave this film 7/10 because 70% was great the part where you see a flying saucer taking off really annoyed me and they have as a result killed the legend that is Indiana Jones",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1362,bigbossfilms-1,My Review (slight spoilers),1,3 June 2008,"Now. There are just a few problems with this film. The baddies aren't very bad, just ideologues (but then a left-liberal, Jewish director understandably can't really hate the Soviets in the same way that he might hate the Nazis). This is a major problem. Baddies need to be cruel and loathsome. The CGI is laughable and out of keeping with the rest of the franchise (cf The Phantom Menace et al.). There is absolutely NO tension (something SS usually does rather well). At all. The action scenes are preposterously impossible-looking and the protagonists seem superhumanly endowed and unafraid. The clues are pre-teen in simplicity. It is derivative of bunkum like Von Daniken etc. The dialogue is naff beyond belief. There is no wit. It is badly edited, and includes rather odd lines that sound as if they were ad-libbed and not cut. It looks cheap, and is flatly lit and composed. It looks, in fact, studio- bound and as if the majority of the visuals were originated on George's computer. Which of course they were. It is not funny. It is predictable and patronising, yet oddly alienating to younger viewers (""I like Ike,"" says Dr Jones. ""You like who?"" say a million under-15s). It defies the laws of physics, the Skull becoming magnetic only when it suits the shoddy narrative. The ending is moralising and deflating. They couldn't really have messed this up any more, and it's all really sad... George should have retired a long time ago.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1363,jomo999,"After years of Indiana Jones pretenders, Spielberg and Lucas show everyone how it's done. Not perfect, but perfect entertainment and a worthy entry in the series.",8,17 July 2008,"After 19 years of waiting, fans finally get to see Harrison Ford don the Fedora once more in this 4th instalment in the franchise.As with the first three, the movie starts with a titbit of what Dr. Jones has been up to in his spare time. We're introduced to Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), a Soviet agent who with the help of a unit of soldiers, breaks into a government warehouse and orders Indiana, who happens to be travelling with fellow agent 'Mac' (Ray Winstone) to search for one of his past archaeological finds. In a spectacular getaway involving jeeps, atomic testing and the preposterous use of a fridge as a bomb shelter we are thrust into a shaky but undeniably exhilarating adventure.With the help of a young greaser Mutt (LaBeouf) and old flame Marion Ravenwood (Allen) Indiana is wound up in a race against time to stop Spalko gaining control of the powerful Crystal Skull artefact. In usual Indy fashion we are treated to various exotic locations, a far-fetched plot involving the supernatural and plenty of action sequences.If there's one thing this film does flawlessly, it's the stunts. Despite George Lucas' involvement you will be happy to hear the CGI is never excessive and the set-pieces deftly balance live action with special effects. Though the action gets relentless towards the film's climax, they are consistently exciting and well executed. Indiana and Mutt's motorcycle escape from the FBI and a chase through the jungles of South America are both particularly noteworthy. Harrison Ford is not just nimble for his age, he slides back into the role so comfortably you wouldn't think it has been 19 years since his last adventure. He can still throw a punch or deliver a wry one-liner. But perhaps the biggest surprise is Shia LaBeouf who is very amiable and develops a warm father/son relationship with Indy, rather like Ford and Connery did in 'The Last Crusade' but with Indiana serving as the father figure this time.Crystal Skull is not all good news however. Although the idea behind the plot is fascinating and a fresh take on the formula of the series, its execution is jumbled and we are often force-fed far too much archaeological jargon at once. Though the film's final revelation provides all the answers you can't help but feel that the information has been withheld for a little too long. In spite of this, Lucas' script manages to fit in some clever and amusing references to 1950's America such as A bombs, the Red Scare and even includes an inspired moment when a fight breaks out in a diner between greasers and jocks. The inclusion of the character 'Mac' I felt was unnecessary and Irina Spalko, despite being charmingly played by Blanchett was under-developed and remains one of the weaker villains of the franchise. As great as the action scenes are, some viewers may find certain instances hard to swallow such as the aforementioned bomb-proof fridge, Mutt's use of 'Tarzan' vines in the jungle chase and the attack of killer ants although with this particular scene I was glad to see Lucas and Spielberg's fondness for nasty creepy crawlies remained intact.Indiana Jones 4 may be ridiculous, convoluted and way overdue, but it provides 2 hours of high quality entertainment. The visceral thrills, Harrison Ford's return, a strong supporting cast and that old fashioned sense of adventure more than make up for the flawed script. As long as you don't go expecting another 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', you won't be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1364,robandtiina,Have you all forgotten the first three movies?,7,25 May 2008,"Before I went to see the movie, I checked out many of the reviews on IMDb and built myself up to be disappointed. Thankfully, I wasn't.I think a lot of the comments made against this movie are made without really giving any consideration or thought to the story lines of the original trilogy.No, it's not believable - it's Indiana Jones - it's the magic of cinema and the return of an iconic action hero. The magic is still there; I suggest that all you severe critics take a good look at the original movies and then, and only then, if you decide to.. post a negative opinion.I am one of many who will no doubt look forward to another Indy movie - this movie has every right to be the biggest movie of 2008.The negative comments posted on IMDb would appear to be jumping on a bandwagon.

Harrison Ford was in it, there were a few hints of Indy here and there but in the end this was an action movie starring Harrison Ford. There was no ""Indiana"" moment, way too much CGI and not enough story. I'm sorry but futuristic artifacts and indiana jones just don't belong in the same world. The clean perfectly shaped crystal skull just seemed so out of place in the dirty, grimmy, dusty world of indiana Jones, especially the space ship at the end of the movie, hell even my wife who is not much a movie person turned to me and said ""Indiana Jones & the Martians""? It just doesn't go. And way too much CGI, everything looked to perfect and clean there was no roughness to anything. The acting was perfectly fine but there was no magic, no mystery, after 20 years of trying to find the holy grail of scripts this is what they chose?? I don't understand how this is getting all these great reviews, I mean is it because it's lucas and Spielberg together again? AS a generic action movie it's good, as a indiana jones movies its a far cry from the trilogy.

1368,TheCheshireCody,A good night of Indy cinema,7,23 May 2008,"There are just a few reasons for a film to exist. It can enlighten, it can educate, it can entertain. An Indiana Jones flick is meant to do the last. This type of movie does not exist to bring anything new to the silver screen - none of them have - but to bring us something old in a fun and exciting way. So, does Indy 4 entertain? I saw it with my fiancée last night, and as the end credits were rolling, we both said ""I want to see it again!"" We laughed, we oohed and aaahed, we gripped the armrests during tense moments, we cheered when bad guys bit the dust, applauded when Marion appeared, gasped at the spectacular moments - we did everything we expected to do,and wanted to do, during an Indiana Jones movie, and we had a damn good time doing it.This film starts off slow, throws in a couple of unnecessary (but very fun) sequences, and then ramps up with a vengeance. For the record, the groundhog sequence is *maybe* fifteen seconds of the film, so at least one reviewer here really needs to move on. The premise is far-fetched, but based in established lore and ties together a number of conspiracy theories from around the world and through the years.My biggest problem with this film is, oddly enough, the production value. This is Indy, not Indie, and yet there was CGI that looked like CGI, model cities that looked like models and the titular Crystal Skull, which looked like something I'd buy at a dollar store, and was lifted by the actors as if it weighed less than a pound.Bottom line: don't listen to the fanboys who should be more concerned with getting out of their parents' basements than the adventures of a fictional character. Don't fall into the spoilers, the ""is it really about A****s?"" - just see the movie and enjoy. That's all Spielberg ever asked of you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1369,slyfeind,Indiana Jones Is Back,8,23 May 2008,"When the movie started with a jalopy drag-racing to 50's music, I thought oh yes, that is the George Lucas we all missed so much. It was odd to see Indiana Jones in the 1950's, and yet it was satisfying to see the character move forward in years. How does Indy feel about the Red Scare? Where would he be during the testing of the atomic bomb? Does he slow down in years, and in what ways? I was afraid it was going to be through Shia LeBeauf's eyes, like Indy 2 was through Short Round's, but this was all Indy's story. And as much as I've hated LeBeauf's work before, he's actually likable in this movie. Karen Allen's still got it as Marion. I loved the golden years romantic comedy feel of Marion and Indy's relationship. It was a new dynamic, but it fit.I hear or read criticisms, and I remember watching those points and saying ""Oh heck yeah, that's Indy."" He starts out as a skeptic and ends with a spectacular display of special effects caused by things he doesn't believe in. There's over-the-top action and stunts no human being could do. There's creepy crawly things behaving in unnatural ways. There's humor, a good dose of slapstick, and even a bit of humanity and honest feeling. It's an action romp, and it's fun, and it's Indiana Jones all the way through.I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie, especially fans of Indiana Jones. I blame those rose colored glasses we all wear as we look back on the past. Indy 4 is very well done, almost on par with the first one. And it's certainly one of the best movies this summer, and it lives up to the legacy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1370,nighthunterx,Medium movie considering its legacy,5,28 May 2008,"I think that the skull topic was pretty far stretched. It simply was too much. It was nothing like the past artifacts that had either religious or archaeological importance.Of course we would expect to see CGI effects nowadays but AT LEAST Steven Spielberg should know better or he should have just respected HIS trilogy's legacy and let it be. But, of course, no one in Hollywood has any fresh ideas today and they all want to suck dry what little is left out of past successful projects. The magic was gone and in many parts it seemed more like a comedy than an adventure movie. Yes, the landscapes looked fantastic and Ford was great but a crystal skull? And that was supposed to be a historical artifact? Please! The Ark, the Holy Grail are legendary items but this...Anyway, I think the trilogy would have been better off without this sequel. The basic reasons a fan should spend their buck to watch it are Harrison Ford and some of the action that was quite decent. Other than that, it was a typical Hollywood action movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1371,Jacovitti86,Mixed feelings **SPOILERS**,7,24 May 2008,"Like many Indy fans I was looking forward to this movie more than any movie that's ever come before.. perhaps there was no chance I would ever be satisfied.. but I still feel like some people involved in this movie did not give it their all, and I feel Spielberg especially has finally let me down with this one..My biggest problem with this movie was not really the ending, but strangely enough the performances.. in many scenes I felt the attempts at comic relief just fell flat and the dialog was sometimes corny as hell (""they all had one problem.. they weren't you honey!"").. for example the scene where Indy and Marion are in the quicksand.. it could have been a suspenseful exciting sequence, but somehow they turn it into a comic relief moment as they start arguing about Mutt.. and then they use the snake as a rope.. COME ON..For me the re-introduction of Marion just didn't work and you could tell Karen Allen hadn't been in a movie for ages.. also the way her and Indy get all lovey-dovey again after about 10 minutes is completely phony..Say what you want about the originals, they had much more heart than this movie, especially the third one, where I thought the Indy-dad relationship was handled really well.. and in that movie, the comic moments actually WORKED.. also whenever I think about Last Crusade and the other two movies, I always can't help but think about the incredible score.. each movie was recognisable by great themes.. but in this one.. NOTHING.. I think JW has lost it and Spielberg should start working with someone else..Now of course as you see I gave the movie a 7 so there must be some good about it.. and that basically comes to two words, one person.. HARRISON FORD.. seeing him back in this iconic role, and in a different period in time, is just so much fun that he almost single-handedly saves the movie.. he knows this character inside out and it's wonderful to see him play it again... also I think the first 30-40 minutes of the movie are a lot of fun and really had me hoping this movie would live up to expectations (Wilhelm screaming student.. statue of Marcus Brody.. nods to 50s culture.. all great stuff) .. Shia LeBeouf is fun in his role and I enjoyed the final shot when Indy takes the hat from him and walks out of the church..But somehow once the movie actually gets more and more into its story I got confused.. a lot of things about it are quite confusing and perhaps I'll understand them better the second time..Also I didn't feel there was a good villain in the story.. Mac was just a sleazy money-hungry traitor, who didn't really add anything to the movie, Spalko wasn't really that mean (did she ever kill someone?) and I actually felt bad for her when she died..Finally about the ending.. I have nothing against aliens but why have them look exactly like every other alien ever seen in a movie?? And why not show us some of the 'knowledge' they were transmitting to Spalko? We got to see what killed the Nazis in Raiders.. but here it's left to our imagination.. which I thought was disappointing.. also the acting (or should I say over acting) in the wedding scene just made me cringe.. I know Spielberg likes to shoot fast but he could have ordered a few more takes on that one..So in the end I must admit I felt underwhelmed but I will still probably own it on DVD.. essentially it's not a bad movie but it could have been MUCH better..",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This film is up there with Jason X, Die Another Day and Tim Burtons remake of Planet of the Apes. You would think Hollywood's finest dream team: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas would always keep pushing the limits of film making and show the young up and coming film makers just how its done but no. In this film these two just remind me of Max Bailystock and Leo Bloom from The Producers ""We can make more money from a flop than a hit"" With that said now let me tell you the highs and lows of this movie:Highs: Harrison Ford reprising the role of Indiana Jones (and no, despite what the critics say about his age he still has it, go Harrison!)Shia LaBeouf, he plays Mutt Williams another strong performance from himThe opening scene with 50's style road race (very George Lucas.)The Indiana/Mutt vs. the Russians chase scene through the grounds of the university That's it I'm afraid now for the LowsLows: Indiana Jones surviving a nuclear blast (this isn't Superman IV Quest for Peace although that film is better than this film) after the fridge that he is hiding in gets blasted through the air like the escape pod from Star Wars, Indiana Jones gets out of the batter refrigerator, stands up and looks at the nuclear mushroom cloud from the blast (That should have been my signal to leave the cinema)Gone are the big trademark set pieces with lots of extras, all replaced with, yes you've guessed it shoddy CGI. (When will Hollywood learn audiences are fed up of CGI!)? Ray Winstone's character of George 'Mac' McHale. Am I Indiana's friend, enemy, and double agent, Secret agent? Too confusing.Karen Allen reprising the role of Marion, unfortunately in this film her acting is just far to over the top. (I blame the script)John Hurt as Professor Henry 'Ox' Oxley. John Hurt is a fantastic actor always a pleasure to see him in movies! But what is he in the film a mumbling spacing out hippie anybody could play this role what a waste of a great actor. (Again I blame the script) Stunts, there is only one original Indiana Jones trademark stunt show piece in the film and that's at the warehouse at the start of the movie. The rest are all small stunts merged with poor CGI (more real big stunts scenes please)Man eating CGI ants (hasn't the film The Mummy got something similar, no sorry my mistake that film got CGI man eating beetles)The clear plastic prop with aluminium foil stuffed in it - no wait that's meant to be an alien crystal skull.Alien crystal skeletons coming to life in the finally (George and Steven what have you guys being smoking?)Then right at the very end the Aztec temple they're escaping from all in blows up in an extraterrestrial way and a spaceship takes off (Its OK I know what you saying if your reading this ""This is an Indiana Jones film right?"") Summery: Lucas/Spielberg promised to make a film for the fans with as little CGI as possible; they have not kept their promises. As a fan of the original trilogy I feel cheated. I think everyone was just thinking $$$$$ on this film. I would love to read the other scripts that George Lucas turned down; anything could have been better this.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1374,bobinson_mcloeb,Better than I expected!,10,22 May 2008,"******* This comment MAY contain Spoilers ********I'm a cynic. It's just my nature. If someone tells me something is the greatest thing since sliced bread, I usually lower my expectations just so I'm not disappointed.I grew up a fan of Indianna Jones. I watched all the movies... repeatedly. I'd fake an illness to stay home from school and watch the Indy movies (and others, naturally). So, as you might expect, when I heard about a *new* Indy film, my first reaction was to expect the worst. As new information leaked out, I started to expect even less...Shia LaBeouf? EGADS man... what're you doing with my childhood hero Mr. Spielberg? A 65 year old Harrison Ford? I don't recall Indianna Jones being the kind to have hip problems... He's limber, agile, and I should like to always think of him in that manner.This is where I was wrong.1) Shia LaBeouf did not play the usual clumsy, bumbling teen aged geek he usually portrays. He actually had a character this time around. And the character, while having a youthful naivety, was more strong willed and tough than others he played. ""Mutt"" Williams was a character who fit into the Indy universe, and he and Harrison Ford worked very well together.2) Harrison Ford looks like a 45-50 year old. I had read comments on here about the CGI covering for his age, but I found it to be the opposite. While it was apparent where stunt men had come into play during certain scenes it was jaw dropping to SEE Harrison running around and fighting off Russian KGB agents. The Jungle scenes including the chase was where I was the most surprised. If anything the CGI was used to help push along either humor elements (Once again in the Jungle chase), or to help give the climax more visual appeal. The story was driven by the work of Mr. Ford and his motley gang of misfits, and their physical reactions and not some computer interruptions (like most Lucas films).I especially enjoyed the nods to other films in this one. Especially the nods to ""Raiders"" and ""The Last Crusade"". Somehow they even managed to throw in a classic Star Wars line, which Harrison repeats for the first time in a long time when he mutters ""I have a bad feeling about this"" leading up to the climax.Was this film flawed? Yes. There was some silliness that could've been omitted and probably would've made the movie better in my eyes. It seemed that some elements were added to make this film more geared towards family entertainment. The story had some little holes in the plot that were never really explained. But these flaws are easily overlooked. This wasn't a thought provoking film meant to get you thinking. It was a fun film meant to entertain and on those grounds it delivers in spades.I'd rank this one as my third favorite, behind ""Raiders"" and ""The Last Crusade"", but by no means does that mean I didn't enjoy it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Neither of the actors - not even Harrison Ford himself - did a good job on acting.Throughout the movie you never really dive into the story like in previous Indiana Jones movies. The story is a shallow composition of previous Indiana Jones scenes which don't add up.I can hardly believe it was made by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. It feels like it took them not 10 years, but 10 minutes to write the script.I hope they improve for the next installment, and I will only watch it if Harrison Ford is still a part of it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1376,phrostbite,My 4 year old writes a better script!,1,19 November 2008,"If you like Indiana DON'T watch this movie. It's better to remember him the way he was in previous movies. To hide the fact that this movie is so bad they put stupid jokes in it,so bad that no comedian would dare to do them on-stage or risk being stoned to death.No IJ movie is complete without a few highspeed chases but even those are boring. To spice them up they use a bucket of special effects which hide a few of the biggest mistakes. With every chase you see the tiremarks of the testrun on the road so you can tell where they brake or change direction.The historical facts in this movie are mostly wrong and so many I stopped counting. In a lot of scenes you see crew or equipment like spotlights or microphones. The amount of continuity goofs is so big I could make a list a few pages long.Conclusion: Maybe kids could appreciate this movie but I can't. This movie is a waste of time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1377,bjarketrux,"Enough with the effects, what about the characters?",1,23 May 2008,"People either love or hate the fourth installment of Indiana Jones: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Scull. I’ll give it 5 out of 10, which should be read as mediocre.Allot has already been said about the different scenes: It’s not realistic! There is too much CGI, etc. I won’t disagree, but not much has been said about the characters.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) He is getting old! Even though he might be more fit that most others in his age he just isn't the old Indy from the first three movies. It shows in most of the scenes – just as small things: The way he moves, less energy overall. He might be doing allot of the stunts himself, but it doesn't make him seem less old.Don’t get me wrong he is not a bad actor. And there is still a hidden spark of the real Indiana Jones in his eyes. There are no real scenes in the movie that allows him to show his acting abilities though. He is not really mad, sad, happy, scared, or anything else. It feels like he is flowing with the movie hoping to please his fans, but does not himself enjoy the script.Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) When you first heard that LaBeouf was taking your places as Indiana Jones’ son, you kind of hated him. But in fact I think that LaBeouf is one of the most enjoyable characters in this movie. He is the one taking all the beating in the beginning of the movie, which eases him in for a stronger relationship with Ford. Also the best chemistry is between these two characters, though it newer reaches a desired height. Overall a great character, but I sincerely do not hope that he is going to star in his own Indiana Jones’ son spin-off.Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) Cate Blanchett follows the endless stream of evil villains that stands in the way of Indiana Jones and his goal. She is not really convincing and the biggest fight is actually between her and LaBeouf. She has no real trademark that she will be remembered for. The only thing she seems to have is some magical powers (which is forgotten after one scene of use) and a collection of three swords she carries with her. Oh sorry - and her black wig. I kind of wished she would have some kind of relationship with Jones as Joanne Whalley and Val Kilmer in Willow. She just seems to be another character in the plot.Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) Perhaps the worst character and acting is Karen Allen. She was good in the original Raiders of the Lost Ark as the tough bartender that always seemed to get in trouble and cause problems for Indy. In Kingdom of the Crystal Skull she is a side character. No scene with her has any great acting. There is absolutely no romance between Indy and her like any of the other female opposition it the past movies. You are left longing for a younger, hysterically screaming female, which can make life harder for Indy.Mac (Ray Winstone) and Ox (John Hurt) The replacement for the John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott characters rests on Winstone and Hurt. They are both good actors but are not challenged in this movie. Mac is Indy’s sidekick that I really think would have worked under other circumstances. He is practically ready to dump into an Indiana Jones movie. Unfortunately all the action seems to make you forget him and you mostly see him in small gimps so that you don’t forget that he is in the movie. Hurt has the role of an old friend of Indy, which has gone mad. The plot of the movie is based the story of Hurt’s character trying to find the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. He is in the largest part of the movie being dragged after Indy and only rarely has anything to give to the plot.Conclusion I was expecting more. Hoping for a good movie driven by a good story and strong characters. I believe that was the magic behind the first three Indiana Jones movies. Instead I got an overly action packed CGI adventure with mostly unfunny jokes. There were some good parts, especially the first part of the movie where we got to know the LaBeouf character. I would even say that most of the Young Indiana Jones adventures are better than this movie.5 of 10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1378,Tubes007,Age hasn't slowed you one bit.,8,22 May 2008,"Got back from the midnight screening and all I can say is that I am satisfied. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is all that I could hope for and more. Despite some nitpicking flaws, it's just as good as it was in the 80's.For starters, Harrison Ford jumps back into the role like he never left it. Despite some wrinkles and some greying hairs, he is Indiana Jones. He still brawls with the best of them and has the same kamikaze attitude that made him such a fun character. The same goes for Karen Allen, who jumps back into Marion as if she never left the role. The chemistry between her and Ford is instant and almost exactly the same as it was in Raiders with almost nothing lost to the 27 year gap between films. Best of all, her character isn't butchered for a few laughs like Brody was.For the newcomers, Ray Winstone does an average job as Mac and probably is the only sore spot in the cast. Aside from a few gags and near constant side switching, he does nothing in the film and his pet name for Indy (""Jonsey!"") is irritating. On the positive side, Cate Blanchett plays a different kind of Indy villain very effectively. I can only describe it as ""sexy evil"". Combine that with a tight uniform and plenty of shots of her walking away from the camera and you are a very far cry from Mola Ram and Belloq. She's also on screen for more time than the previous villains and her near constant presence makes this more of a chase movie than an adventure in the latter half. Probably the best newcomer is Shia. I always figured him to be a good actor, but he fills the role of Mutt very well. He has good chemistry with Ford and the banter between the two is realistic and very funny.My major quibble with the movie should come as no surprise. It still looks too slick and artificial and the special effects still remind me of the Prequels a bit. However, these are minor quibbles in a great package. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a slam bang adventure and is currently my favorite movie released this year.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1379,PeteTownshendJr,A great action movie! Welcome back Indy!!!,10,24 May 2008,"The fourth installment of the Indiana Jones series is anything but disappointing. No it isn't like the first three but it is still just as good. Now I've seen this movie twice already so it is apparent that I am a fan of the film and of course in turn would write a very positive comment. Yes, it's true that I loved the film but I am ashamed to say that some Indy fans don't feel the same way I do about number 4. I understand that George Lucas has not had much success reviving his old scripts/stories and certain parts of the movie he could have entirely left out...like when Indiana survives the nuke. I even was thinking that the Indiana Jones movies have been pretty far-fetched at some points but this is just a bit too unreal. There is still the old action that we all loved from the first three. Car chases, explosions, Indy beating up on someone and of course topped off with the traditional gruesome villain death. Of course everyone is buzzing about the aliens. I THINK IT'S GREAT! Yeah some may say it's impossible for aliens to be that connected to the earth, but it isn't at all out of the question. I mean civilizations like the Mayans and the ancient Egyptians did have incredibly developed societies with great structures and technology much before it's time. And back in the 1950s many people were really unto the whole ""aliens on earth"" deal. Crop circles, UFO sightings, abductions, etc. So I think it was appropriate that they connect aliens to the the movie because all that buzz was going on at this time some of the alien stories could have just been cover ups for actual extraterrestrial encounters. You never know!But seriously, SEE THIS MOVIE! It doesn't hurt the old character of Indiana, he's still his regular self. Only older. The people who don't like the movie are just stuck in the past, but time comes with change. So roll with it! And go see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1380,mette-34,George Lucas ruined this movie!,3,28 May 2008,"The problem with 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is that it totally abandons the heritage, formula and sense of impending doom that made the original films so special.The script is absolutely awful hamming up Indiana Jones to an imaginary new audience of unintelligent kids. I expected more from Lucas and believed the movie would have been a way to make up for the mass disappointment he caused with the recent Star Wars films.Lines are all spoken one after the other spelling out the plot and reminding you of what is happening, as would happen in a pantomime or school play.The worst thing about the movie as with other big movies in Hollywood is the propensity to overuse CGI. The other films were 95% live action with great stunts. For example in 'Last Crusade' you have a 'real' train fight, tunnel of rats on fire, speedboat chase, castle escape, bikechase, tankfight, tasks. This is non stop vintage and believable action that keeps you on the edge of your seat as you genuinely believe Indy is a mortal character that could bite the bullet at any point.If they were to remake 'Raiders', rest assured that those snakes would be fake CGI snakes, and all those extras digging at Tannis would be result of a digital copy/paste job, turning 12 real people into 150 extras.'Crystal Skull' feels like a poor mans Van Helsing/ The Mummy/ by trying to imitate visual effects that have been used almost ten years before in other movies.Crystal Skull' chops and changes too quickly without giving time for the characters to develop. They literally walk into a tomb, find what they are looking for, and walk out again. In the others the treasure was always boobytrapped.The saddest thing about this film is that it will still turnover a massive amount of revenue purely on the strength of the legendary status given to the movie by legions of movie fans who helped to build the franchise now in their 20's, 30's and 40's with kids. It however betrays this audience in favor of appealing to young unintelligent children that in reality simply don't care about Indiana Jones when they have already seen similar CGI heavy movies with poor scripts as in The Mummy, Van Helsing, Pirates of the Caribean etc.Its so upsetting because Hollywood is falling into the trap of the quick buck. But in 20 years time you will NOT be looking back at this with the great fondness you did with the others.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1381,walkforever,"Indy is back, and guess what.. its so damn much FUN!",9,14 October 2008,"First thing I'd like to say is that I am a long time Indy fan, being Raiders the first ever movie I remember having watched (in a VCR), so it means my expectations for Kingdom were high. And yes, I did have a blast with this movie, having a smile on my face from the Paramount logo scene until the hat joke in the end. I know that taste for a movie is extremely subjective, but what I don't understand is how some fans don't relate this movie with the old ones.. IMO it has the same absurd things that make these films cool. Everybody loved the falling down in a boat from a flying plane, the ripping of the heart off, the knight that lived for a thousand years etc, but ppl find too strange the ""nuclear fridge"" or the sword fight in a moving truck.. well I can say I had the same chilling watching the waterfall scene than I had with the bridge being cut in half in Temple, for example. It did have some elements I didn't like (Blanchet's acting was a bit far fetched to me, the swinging with the monkeys scene was just pointless) but aside from that I think the movie fulfills what an Indy movie is supposed to be: a pure and simple FUN adventure..unrealistic, but still FUN",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

One of my favorite action movies hero becomes a puppet of Mr Loucas' CGI industry and the hole thrilling of the series ends up improperly.Here are the 3 reasons why fans (including me) were disappointed: 1) The script was bad. So bad that i found the childish temple of doom a masterpiece. (I should have known when I found out that Mr Koepp wrote script of War Of Worlds). 2) A lot of CGI because Mr Loucas is in business a long time now & wants to sell & not create ideas any more. 3) Spielberg's made efforts to save a decade of medium movies in his portfolio with a huge blockbuster.Ford still has it and he is the only one who tries to save the movie from the disaster. Marion's appearance was unnecessary from my point of view, Shia & Blanchett were OK but not in the spirit of series.

1383,tekoteli,Terrible Jones movie,1,30 November 2008,"All people in the world know that when Jones was looking for the Lost ark, he became famous because he was looking for something which is a human legend. The second time, when he was first looking for something which is NOT a human legend (the temple), the movie makers must have seen that the people did not find it that good ... I was under this impression because the third one again went for a human legend, the Grail ... and the movie was again of high quality such as the lost ark.In the last movie, the try to combine a little piece of human legend (eldorado) with something completely impossible. The movie uses to much completely absurd things, I mean 1. surviving a huge waterfall in a vehicle 2. fencing between to cars while driving a rain forest 3. monkey who are fighting the villains 4. a dude which is becoming Tarzan in 3 seconds and can go faster than a vehicle Sorry, When Salah, Marcus, Jones Sr and Jones junior are leaving Alexandretta and drive into the desert, that is how Indy disappeared from the screen ...And this movie?

1384,graemejwalker,This Film Is BAD,1,22 May 2008,"Here lies Indiana Jones. Another notch on the tomb of modern cinema. Just look at it! I am sitting back at home thoroughly unexhausted and under-entertained by the overwhelming lack of soul in this production. I am trying to find ways to forgive it, but all I can think of is ""Well, it is an Indy film"", which is completely lame. Poor lame old Indy, if only he had half the gumption of his dead pa, but ol' hopalong just can't cut the mustard no more.What is there that is commendable here? This film is excruciatingly poor: edited to the point of gibberish, with endlessly pointless, improbable and disconnected ""action"" ""sequences""; zero mis-en-scene or character development, who are these people? And what is the ""world"" they occupy? And who cares?; bad/zero dialogue - a charmless script, no wonder Indy is almost completely absent from the film as is any sense of ""chemistry"" between either his future wife or his ""son"", who is clearly going to be ""the next Indiana Jones"". Yuck!For most of today I have been humming the theme tune in anticipation, but there is almost no soundtrack of note in the film and certainly none of the wonderful ""here we go! We're in an Indiana Jones film! Huzzah!"" stuff, which should have happened, I reckon, right at the start. Instead we get kind of half-arsed snippets of bland whatever bits that amount to serious amounts of nothing... Oh lord!What is so painful though here is, above everything, the persistence of the use of CGI. Listen up! It's no good! Please please stop using it. It looks bad, just bad bad bad. It will never look good. You cannot win over the hearts of people (who are, you must admit, your target audience) who prefer films without it. We don't like it for a reason.I cannot muster the energy to say anything else here - it is already being said, everywhere... THIS FILM IS BAD.

Harrison Ford was doing more of an impression of Indy, as apposed to becoming the character. Aliens as a plot device could have worked if it was done right... yet, I don't believe they pulled it off. There was too much of a light hearted feel about the whole film, as if it was just a bit of a yarn. I was really looking forward to this film, but after seeing it, i felt really... well... annoyed.

Being a fan of the older Indiana movies I wasn't expecting much of this 19 years later-sequel, but I was - like I said earlier - happily surprised. Harrison Ford is still doing good, Karen Allen is back which is a nice touch, Shia does the job well and Cate Blanchett is a great, even though a bit under-developed, villain. Sure, there were some things that weren't logical (like the guns not being magnetic in Area 51), but if you can't look past stuff like that you are actually searching for flaws and not being very open-minded.Because I do think that this is a worthy sequel and I think that a lot of people actually decided to hate it before even watching it, not thinking of the possibility of the movie actually being good.

Never the less I went to see this movie yesterday, having no real expectations on what it would be.The movie holds up on it's own. Solid acting, story is good and the action is top notch. The problem for me was, however, the action. This movie seemed to focus more on the action than the previous installments in the Indy series. I missed the mystical aspect more. The puzzles, the wow factor of it all. It was there but was in much smaller amounts than what we are used to.I'd still say that it's cinema worthy, but it does not have the same level as the former three.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1393,pauljustinlean,Same Old Same Old Indy,7,25 May 2008,"Steven Spielberg said in an interview that ""The Temple of Doom"" is his least favourite Indy movie. Well, I happened to like it the most.It stands as the oddest yet refreshingly different among all the Indy movies. When your name is Indiana Jones, people should not be blamed for hoping a little brand new and different kind of experience from the previous one you have.""The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"" is, unfortunately not a ""brand new"" experience for both Indy and us. The time may has changed from the 30s to the 50s, but the structure of the plot is incredibly similar to ""The Last Crusade"". You take away the Nazis, but you replace them with the Russians. You take away Dr. Schneider, here comes Dr. Spalko.Gone might be Indy's father, but we are met with his son, both are the one dragging our reluctant hero into adventures.Of course, the wooden Alison Doody should not be compared to the unbelievably-great-in-any-role Cate Blanchett.With her accent and her haircut, not to mention the evil look in her eyes, Cate Blanchett is the true star of the movie. A lot of people might give praises to Shia LaBeouf (of course he does deserved all the praises), Cate stole the entire show with a minor role just like what she did in ""I'm Not There"" and ""The Aviator"". Right from the beginning scene we are hooked by her evilness through the end. The middle part of the film, which she does not appear in, seems somewhat losing its glow. James Bond movie makers please take note, make a better use of Halle Berry in the future.And then we have Shia LaBeouf. He is intentionally low profile in the movie (I think), to not over shine Indy. Cause he easily will be, with all his youthful energy and charisma. We know Indy has the ""typical Indy moment"" when he picks up his hat or his whip, Shia creates his own with his narcissistic ""checking my hair"" moment. The sword fight between him and Cate Blanchett is the highlight of the film, and in my opinion, the best action sequence too. We can see that both the actors put a lot of effort in their training.Speaking of action sequence, a lot of them in the movie found resemblance in its predecessor, even in other movies. Haven't we watch that kind of car-chasing-on-the-busy-road sequence in Jason Bourne movies already? Or that bump-to-bump-car-chasing-in-the-jungle scene in James Bond movies (namely Die Another Day)? Even 2 weeks ago ""Speed Racer"" spotted a similar car-in-the-danger-of-falling-off-the-cliff scene. While I am not here to say ""Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"" copies other movies (because it certainly is not!), I just wish that they can come out with some take-our-breath-away creative action sequences. Spielberg and Lucas are 2 of the most talented movie makers in the world. They can do better. Especially when you have 19 years to conceive ideas.I still wish they could keep Karen Allen's appearance a secret, instead of the whole storyline. I mean, the storyline is half the same with ""National Treasure 2 : Book of Secrets"" (the lost city of gold, anyone?). We will certainly not surprised by the E.T. twist. Come on, we have seen even weirder plot or ending with more twist. On the other hand, if we never knew Karen Allen is coming back, but she appeared suddenly out of the tent, we will be presently surprised and totally carried away (Some may not agree, but why can't they make Willie Scott come back too?).Not to mistakenly thinking I dislike the movie. I enjoyed it, as I enjoyed the previous 3 movies. It's just I'm not jumping up and down worshiping it enthusiastically. When you have high expectation and hope, you tend to disappoint the most. Maybe it is better to leave it at the trilogy, as trilogy seems to be a perfect circle for any movie franchise. It would felt odd to make the fourth one. Just ask Francis Ford Coppola is he gonna make another Godfather movie.But Indy, you are still our hero, though we all know you are no longer young. You will be enjoying you retire life like our beloved Sean Connery do one day too. So if you are coming back for one more adventure few more years to come, don't forget to hand over that hat and that whip to your son.

The first three movies relied on wit, good acting and writing, and good stunts. This one relied on a flimsy script, undeveloped characters, and CGI. I felt like the performances were really forced, and that the storyline was thrown together way to fast to be at least half-way decent. I think Lucas has maybe let Star Wars influence ALL! While the other movies were not 'realistic' in the sense that they used magic and such, they at least seemed almost feasible if you just let your mind wander a bit (at least ROTLA and The Last Crusade). This one was way too sci-fi for my taste. The first three always seemed to return to things that are in tune with human faith and group beliefs in Gods and things like that. But the ending on this one (those of you who saw it know what I'm talking about) is just too out there. And while I think Cate Blanchette is a wonderful actress, there was something off with the role. Either she didn't play it to the best of her ability, or it wasn't developed enough.

I did not walk into this movie with any detailed expectations. The lack of detailed expectations kept me from asking my self ""what the f***"" every ten minutes. I was amused while watching it and it was worth going just to see it. but...Everyone who walked out of the theater (including myself) thought that it was simply WAY TO OVER THE TOP and It lacked a sense of mystery and suspense that the other three had. It conveyed points too quickly and left out details. One of the reasons why I say this movie is over the top is the CGI. There was way too much CGI and could have been left out. The computer generated effects took the realistic world we live in (and that Indiana Jones existed in in the previous 3) and made it look like something that would never happen. One thing that the original three films all had in common was they had semi realistic plots. As a kid watching them the concept was easy to grasp. A ark that could harness gods power, 5 stones that could bring power to the holder, and the cup of Christ/eternal life. Even when the healing power of the holy grail is used to heal henry the viewer understood the ""fairy-tail"" that was created. This movie can't compare to the great originals. The Story in the kingdom of the Crystal skull had too many unrealistic/humanly impossible stunts and CGI effects, and made it hard for the viewer to understand the story and not be amused and distracted just by the flashy effect.

1398,mhzfutbol5,Somewhat Disappointing,9,25 May 2008,"I went into this movie without trying to expect the worst (or the best). What I found was a mediocre excuse for an Indiana Jones movie. I know it has been 19 or so years since The Last Crusade but shouldn't that have given Lucas a better premise for the movie. The point at which the film turned bad for me was when Indy and his entourage find the ""Kingdom"" to be some spaceship for interdimentional beings. That was also when I heard a collective groan from the crowd. I can't believe that Spielberg and Lucas had to resort to of all things aliens. This doesn't go without saying that there were a few good scenes. One of my favorites was the scene in the graveyard. I actually thought Ford and Shia had decent chemistry and made this one of the better scenes in the film. Another gem was the motorcycle chase through Yale. This was the ONLY scene where people in the theater actually applauded. That right thee says it all.All of this combined with possibly the worst Russian accent and a lackluster performance from Shia definitely made ""Crystal Skull"" the worst Indy film. The only reason I rated this movie this high is because that without seeing the first three (Who hasn't), this would be a decent movie. Despite a great performance from always amazing Ford, this does not excuse the fact that ""Kingdom of a Crystal Skull"" was a HUGE disappointment to all Indy fans.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1399,johankepler,Old-style cinema,9,1 June 2008,"Indiana Jones is a different kind of movie, not produced anymore today. Those who lived the 80's will remember how eagerly people waited for every new Indiana adventure. And, anyway, Indiana movies set a new standard for movie-making; we can say that there is cinema before and after Indiana Jones, even more than we can say the same about Star Wars. I always thought that the first three were a complete and finished product, and didn't really expect that some day Lucas and Spielberg would film another. Well, they did. And I don't think that people will really be disappointed, unless they go with some preconceived idea - so if the film does not follow their expectations, they will think that the movie is bad. But this is what happens with most expectations, as you may know. To understand Indy, one must go back to another era, the era that inspired Lucas to create Indy in the first place, the adventure movies from the 50's. And that's it. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is adventure cinema at its best, with drama, danger, mystery, romance and comedy. The whole stuff is there, and Ford is fantastic. One only gets a bit melancholic, after finishing the movie, thinking that as the time passes it gets more difficult to see Indy again. But I felt the same, 20 years ago, when The Last Cruzade ended. One thing is certain. This is cinema as it should be done, as was done in the 50's and recreated by Lucas and Spielberg in the 80's. Beautiful movie!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1400,Matthias_Weiden,The same movie without the first three Indies - no one would go to extremes about it,6,1 June 2008,"Let me begin by saying that being only 25 years old, I have sadly missed on the opportunity to see the first three movies in theatres. Nonetheless, my father being something like a fan, I was introduced to Indiana Jones at a rather early age, and have watched each movie several times.My feelings upon entering the cinema were thus a mixture of fear and excitement - fear of suffering something similar to ""Star Wars - Episode 1"" and excitement over seeing Indy for the first time on big screen. Upon exiting, I was above all glad not to have been insulted in the way ""The Phantom Menace"" did its spectators - and felt, after all, to have been rather well entertained.And that, to get to the point of this comment, is about it. I believe that regardless of what one might feel about this movie being the 4th Indiana Jones, you have to give it the credit of being a sometimes overdone, perhaps not very deep, but for the longest time ...entertaining adventure film. Had it just been named ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", I believe that neither the hateful comments calling it an abomination, an outrageous merchandising phenomenon which desecrates its heritage, nor the extremely positive commentators who celebrate the return of their most beloved film hero would try to convince us that this movie is either unspeakably bad or absolutely fantastic.To me, it is neither. Harrison Ford is delivering a very solid performance, which can't be said for all, but for most of the rest of the staff. The plot is nothing special - and apart from numerous, sometimes a little too ""spectacular"" stunt scenes, the film consists mainly of countless hommages to its predecessors.To sum it all up, I can understand that hardcore - Indy - fans may feel deceived, which is always a risk you have to deal with when watching the sequel to a brilliant trilogy from your childhood days, a sequel which is no more than an ordinary adventure movie. To all others I can say that if you leave aside all the Indy - context for one second and look on this movie ""as is"", you might just find it to be rather delighting. Delighting, but certainly not a film you would feel you have to show to your kids once they are old enough.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1401,jcshiao,Sad to say: disappointing and forgettable,5,23 May 2008,"Let me start by saying that I am a *huge* fan of the first three Indiana Jones films. Each of them is a movie that I could happily watch any day, any time.Sitting in the theater just before Crystal Skull began, I wondered if the hype and the long wait would cause this movie to be disappointing simply because the hype and the wait are a lot to live up to. However, I didn't need to worry about that, because the movie was disappointing and forgettable on its own merits.First, the plot was confusing. Russians? Aliens? Mayans? Huh? I was never quite clear on anyone's motivation. The short scene in the diner between Indy and Mutt that provides the prologue that defines the quest was weak. I never quite understood what the quest was about, other than searching for a mutual friend.While the first three films gave you a clear feeling of the time period they were set in, this one was less successful in that area. At times, I felt that Indy looked out of place, an anachronism.At many points throughout the film, I was reminded of other movies. There were some references to the previous Indy movies, but I also felt snippets of Romancing the Stone and other action-adventure movies, giving me a feeling that this one lacked some originality.While I enjoyed seeing Indy as a fallible, aging human being, I felt at times like the filmmakers were trying too hard to make him seem this way.And lastly, the acting was less than impressive. Even Harrison seemed stiff at times.Having said all that, I did laugh out loud several times during the film, and I did enjoy Shia LaBeouf quite a bit. Also it was fun to watch Cate Blanchett do a Russian accent, and look into her cold blue eyes.All in all, the movie was very forgettable. I just saw it last night, and I don't really remember much of it today. It just didn't grab me the way the first three did.Think I'll go watch The Last Crusade now!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1402,icky-in-the-rain,"Yeah, it's different, but it's still Indy!",7,21 May 2008,"C'mon guys...it's not that bad. What were you expecting after ""Terminal"" and ""War of the Worlds"" - Spielberg's Renaissance??? He'll never be that fantastic director that he was in the first three films...CGI and money completely corrupted the guy, who once was able to achieve credibility without the help of a Computer, but by an amazing childlike fantasy. Remember ET? We all cried about that stupid piece of plastic. Though Indy 4 is absolutely not bad, I walked out of the theater trying to dismiss all this cheap CGI-studio-greenscreen-stuff from my memory of the movie. There are so many scenes where you still get a smile on your face , sometimes because of the real good jokes (predominantly in the first half) or a great stunt, or a fist fight between Indy and a bad guy, and then you get the warm feeling to be a child again - but none of these scenes includes CGI (...okay, maybe just a little).Spoilers ahead:Until they get to South America the movie is perfectly fine. And though the whole Crystal Scull thing is not that interesting (why not Atlantis??? Aliens? C'mon!), I was still looking forward to the second half...but then CGI takes over and the movie rushes from escape to fight to escape to fight...but that's still okay...not bad. But then we get this cheesy UFO-alien-stuff...pffff....If the movie would have ended here, I'd probably given it a lower rating, but the last scene takes us back to the start and gives me the warm feeling again, and that's what I came for. So if you're some nostalgic fan of Indy and what to feel like seeing the bull whip for the first time, this movie is absolutely recommendable. If you're looking for a good story and don't care about the character, don't waste your money.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1403,mrinehart7,Great...Exciting...Everything I expected it to be,10,22 May 2008,"This movie was amazing. I enjoyed every bit of it. The special effects were stunning, the actors were great, and there were a lot of funny and humorous moments. The jungle chase scene was extraordinary, and it felt a lot like the old films...just 20 years later. Some people thought some of the action scenes were a little hokey (one of them being the vine swinging), but if you take it as it is and find humor in it, you'll get a lot out of the movie. There were a lot of great lines in the movie, and a specific character reintroduced from the first movies. There was so much going on this movie that it's hard to explain it without actually seeing it. I recommend anyone seeing it, even if you have never seen the originals!Definitely gets a 10/10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1404,gekkiwenwen,I've seen this before...,6,26 May 2008,"At a guess, id say George Lucas watched alien vs predator and the mummy returns the night before he wrote this one up... Discovery of an ancient temple built however many thousand years ago by aliens who had come to earth and taught humans how to farm and build (Ringing a bell? not to mention we learn this story from the wall carvings, just like in AVP) and then at the end the temple gets sucked into another dimension, leaving no trace (mummy returns much?)Basically, what I'm saying is if you combined the mummy returns with alien vs predator, this is exactly what you would get (minus a mummy and some awesome aliens) and that is what really let me down when i saw this in the cinema. I couldn't see anything original, even the ants eating the Russian soldier were horribly similar to the scarabs from the mummy returns, and most of the material this movie had to offer could be found in the other three Indian Jones movies.And lets remember the lesson we all learned from watching this movie: In the case of a nuclear explosion, climb into a lead-lined refrigerator, which will then hurtle you hundreds of meters through the air, smash into the ground, bounce a few times and then land you safe and sound. (possibly the most far-fetched scene of the movie, hell, even aliens are more believable than that)I'll agree some of the CGI was pretty good, and some action scenes were pretty entertaining (the warehouse scene and the jungle car chase) but overall this movie was a real let down.Anyways, thats my two cents.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1405,dcoonfare,Not that bad!,8,5 August 2008,"Everyone is being harsh on this film. Reason being that half of the reviewers saw the magic that was Raiders of the Lost Ark when it was on the silver screen. However this movie does have some fine points and didn't make me want to ""gouge out my eye with a pencil"" or ""rip my liver out and eat acid."" Some people go a little too far to say I didn't like it. Anyways here is my review on some things that needed to change. 1)The Atomic Bomb-I was really looking forward to Indy and the Russians having a good old fashioned car chase with the clock counting down to the nuclear bomb exploding. What I got was Indy climbing in a lead lined fridge. If this was Iron Man that would have flown (no pun intended), but this is Indiana Jones. A suspense filled car chase with Williams' score would have sufficed, and probably would have been cheaper. 2)The Shia-Okay well I guess he was okay, but I don't know what Speilburg sees in him. He was good in this movie, but just felt thrown in. 3)The UFO-Okay I must just say I like the alien in this movie. It IS actually part of the Crystal Skull myth and accurate. I however didn't like the UFO. I feel that was alittle over the top. Maybe just have that canyon collapse and cover the city instead of having a flying saucer. However I must point out the scene was beautiful! 4)CGI-I didn't find the CGI in Indy to be too heavy. I was really expecting more. The atom bomb scene seemed like a miniature to me. It was a lot better than the Star Wars fiasco. Think about it the two biggest names in special effects ARE going to use CGI. I don't know why people were surprised Speilburg said that he would use CGI when something wasn't humanly possible. That's what he did.Other than that the script could have been better, but that's it. I enjoyed this movie and will buy it when it comes out. It certainly wasn't Raiders, but it was better than a lot of movies recently, and even in the past year! This is me just wondering, but I feel Speilburg and Lucas worried too much about introducing Indy to the audience now a days. It seemed they forgot that Indy is such a big franchise already, and many of the teenagers and kids today have already seen the past instalments. Stick to what you know best guys making fun and exciting thrill rides. Not Micheal Bay explosions.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1406,butlov,Indy is back for the last time...,8,22 May 2008,"I am not a huge fan of Indiana Jones, even if i saw the previous three pictures. I wanted to see it, not for the collaboration between Lucas, Spielberg and Ford, but i was eager to see Cate Blanchett as a villain, and i was totally, thrilled by her. First, her Russian accent was just perfect (she is probably well known for using different accents in each movies she's in). Two, she was more evil than very frightening, that makes her, in my opinion, the most intriguing Indy villain, of all time. Three, i love her cut hairstyle, makes her so sexy. I think this Indy picture is not the best of all, but it remain a good entertainment. Harrison Ford, in his 60's looks ten years younger, and is still able to play hero.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1407,vegania,Big disappointment.,1,25 May 2008,"Spoilers ahead.I was waiting for this film since the first time I heard It was going to be made, about four years ago. Then came the problems with the script. Spielberg likes this one, but Lucas not, etc. Then they said they had difficulties to match their agendas. Finally the movie was made; almost twenty years later I had my tickets and watched Harrison Ford as Indy again at last...People, what took you so long?, after all the wait you come up with this? Despite the digital animal that opens the film and seeing Indy survive an atomic explosion (?!!) by using a fridge, the first part of the movie still remind the audience to the original Indy, but once they travel to Peru the film is completely lost (BTW is using a CGI really THAT necessary for that simple opening scene?, don't they remember we've seen thousands of snakes, bugs, bats and rats in the same franchise, all of them for real?).Once the travel to South America (what's the point on showing us they take the motorbike with them?, just to say ""oh I left it at the cemetery""?) it turns into a ""mummy"" movie, with all the abuse of CGIs that is common these days in almost every Hollywood movie, but it's really painful to find all those cheap cheesy cartoonish digital effects in a Spielberg movie.The script is so easy that all the characters do is running straight till the end of the movie. They escape from the Russians, they escape from the ants, they escape from the indians just running straight and using this multi purpose skull. No real troubles for our hero, not any sub-plot, not any emotion, nor romance, nor thrilling adventure. Laaame.It is really hard to believe this movie was directed by Spielberg. At least not that mythical 80's Spielberg. Crystall Skull is a lot more like Spielberg's Hook or Amistad.When he was shooting, Spielberg said with a big smile that he was making this movie for all the fans, and I believed him. Now I see this movie is nothing but a practical joke for all of them. I feel sort of betrayed.The only good thing about this nonsense is seeing Ford again as Indy. He does his best, and he is REALLY Indiana. It's a shame the rest weren't able to meet the challenge.Steven, George: what happened to you? I just don't understand.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1408,hubbapasha,Saturday Serial the way I like 'em,9,24 May 2008,"I still recall attending a sneak preview of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" The flavor was distinctly that of the old ""Saturday Serials,"" which actually preceded my long years of movie-going, but I had seen on videotape and in art houses. They featured a cliffhanger ending to each 10-minute (one reel of film) episode and then continued the next week with an escape and then, ten minutes later, another inescapable predicament. The end-of-the-episode cliffhanger tradition was ""homaged"" in the ""Batman"" TV series to the great glee of my generation.Ennnnny-hhhooooo, the rhythm of ""Crystal Skull"" was basically that of the old serials, except for the quick turnaround between the first escape from the Russians and the lead-lined escape from the nuclear blast.Another treat for my generation was the iconic image of Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One"" as ""Mutt(no, that's what we called the dog) Williams"" first appeared.I was glad that the references to previous Indiana Jones material was spare and incisive. The Ark of the Covenant, Karen Allen, and Indy's ophidiophobia are reprised from ""Raiders"" and Pancho Villa is mentioned from the excellent ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.""Myself, I try to avoid having any expectations when I see a film, but I did expect the ""Saturday Serial"" experience for my Saturday matinée, and I got just what I expected, with better special effects.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1409,jeehde2,Indiana Jones and the Amazing 4th part.,8,21 May 2008,"Yes, this is the movie we all hoped for. Yes, everything you were hoping for happens and everything you were kinda afraid about happens as well, but turns out to be pretty spectacular and handled in the right fashion. The movie kicks off great, fully illustrating how young Indy actually still is. After it's intro, the movie takes a step back, we learn a bit more about the things that happened in the 20 years that passed. But as soon as Indy meets Mutt Williams, it kicks off again and the roller-coaster isn't going to end till the very last frame. From start to finish it breaths Indy. They took the movie from it's 30's era and placed it into the 50's, which works just fine. There are some hilarious scenes involving greasers and just to get this out there: Shia did just fine. He's taking a side right next to Indy and he handles himself pretty well. He never gets annoying, he never loses himself, he's just really cool the way he is and fits perfectly next to the 'old' man. The rest of the cast is great as well, you can tell Cate is having a great time with her Russian accent, Karen Allen had to be one of the highlights of the movie (especially when they meet <3), Ray Winstone is a funny addition, but neither he nor John Hurt really get a chance to shine. Still, the movie makes good use of it's characters. Probably most importantly, the chemistry between Indiana, Marion and Mutt works. The Mutt-Indy relationship in the movie reminds me of the Jr./Sr. relationship in The Last Crusade and although it doesn't reach the same dazzling heights, it delivers in more ways then I could imagine. The setpieces are all really Spielbergesque, ranging from rainforests and huge temples, to ancient graves or the university Indy teaches. The movie takes you across the world, going back and forth. Story-wise, they didn't play it as safe as I thought they would. You might expect a typical Indy story, and it is, but still, it reaches further then the previous movies did. Indy IV takes complete advantage of it's 'fantasy' edge and for some might go a bit too far now and then. Still, you know you're watching Indiana Jones, so it should be the last thing to worry about. I heard some complaints about the movie's ending, but I thought it was .. great. Fitting. And spectacular. Others complained about the use of special-effects. Spielberg himself said after Cannes that they tried to use CGI only when really necessary. I think they did, you can tell there's a lot of CGI around, but it never takes the upper hand or distracts. So, no worries here. The chases are fantastic, the dialogues funny, the characters worthy, the music once again breathtaking (I love how the skull has it's own score), the stunts stunning and most importantly, Harrison Ford is as Indy as he ever was. If you never liked a single thing about the trilogy, this one won't make you a believer, however, if you're looking for a magnificent time, it's not going to get much better then this. And well, if you're a fan ... just don't worry . The movie hints towards a follow-up that might take a different direction, but for all I care, if it's this good, go ahead and do it while you still can. Classic.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1410,tiernan,"A good film, but not as good as any of the originals",7,2 June 2008,"I saw the midnight premiere and I have to call Indy4 a creditable addition to the Indy Trilogy, but it will probably never been held in the same esteem. Seemingly slow to start, it wasn't really until about halfway through the film that it seemed to find its ""pace"" (in the same vein as the original trilogy) Unlike the original 3, the introductory scene wasn't really a standalone adventure for Indy, and for won't of another term, didn't really start the film with the kind of bang that I'm sure people were expecting. It was also off-putting that, through the entire intro segment, Ford's dialog sounded like nearly all of it was looped, which distracted a bit from what was already not quite as engrossing action as it should have been.It's hard to tell if Harrison Ford's age is what is slowing the film down (i.e. less action, and less of the quality and level of set-pieces and stunts/gags that we were used to from the originals), or if it's just the script. Whichever is the case, it seems quite apparent that Ford does very little of the actual stunt work, which may result in some loss of believability during the big action sequences.All in all, it's a good film, but I can't help but be a little disappointed in the fact that the film really doesn't have the same kind of energy and doesn't reach quite the same level of excitement as the original films did. I have my doubts that it will bring in the kind of box office numbers that the studio is hoping for, if only because of the already-mixed word-of-mouth and reviews we have seen.So, in summary, although I've not been exactly heaping glowing praise on the film, it is absolutely worth seeing.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1411,kgledden,Trap for nostalgics & young hopefuls!,1,25 May 2008,"This film only served to prove that big names can pull anything off...and fill theaters but win few fans. It's a good thing the actors could act although they didn't need to. The film comprised a series of loosely connected chases; all of them formulaic with add-on special effects trawled from The Mummy meets E.T meets the other Indy movies smashed together. How Dr Jones managed to intuit where he was supposed to go, to do what and why was unclear but then the plot was an agonizing mish-mash of misunderstood historical references and bad fiction. Whenever one sits in a movie theater and finds the audience reactions more interesting than the film you can bet the film sucks. And when a film feels like it went on too long it inevitably did; usually because the film-makers were trying to get a bad plot to hang together...another great example: Spiderman III - both a huge waste of time and money.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Hold onto your Potatoes!",9,27 May 2008,"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is an enjoyable film that exceeds ""The Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade"". Of course, it will not be able to touch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", so going to see this film knowing that ensures you will enjoy it more.It's also not an update of the series. It doesn't use the latest and greatest visual effects, although it does use CGI. Whereas ""Raiders"" was inspired by 1930's action serials, ""Temple"" by 1920's A-rated adventure serials, this film is inspired by 1950's sci-fi serials mostly.Indiana Jones is summoned by Mutt Williams to help locate his mom, whom we've already before (hint) and adoptive father, Oxley, in their quest to locate a mysterious crystal skull. Meanwhile, Soviet militants are trying to find it as well, so that Irina Spalko (Blanchett) can learn the powers of psychic manipulation.SPOILERS: It does involve an aliens-influenced-Mayan-civilization plot. This seems like the perfect blend for combining Indiana Jones with the 1950s. All the references to nuclear bombs and Area 51 are well done.Harrison Ford is still very energetic in his role, and there are some touching references to his dad and Marcus being dead.

Fortunately they did not. ""Indy 4"" stands in a clean row with the first three parts: Evil villains, breathtaking action, a marvelous Harrison Ford, a good amount of humur, John William's extraordinary music and a nice ""old fashioned"" flair - that's what was presented to the audience and that's what I expected! Although there are more CGI-effects in the movie than the makers would admit, the effects are PART of the story and NOT THE REASON for it. (A mistake which destroyed my love for Star Wars!)

The Phantom Menace letdown earlier to me was nothing in comparison to this. If the David Koep script was the holy grail of George's en Spielberg's quest than I NEED to read Darabont's and Shaymalan's pitches. This Indy was complete nonsense from beginning to end, and it really aches me to say so. Over the top action sequences, a infantile plot that has nothing, but absolutely NOTHING to do with Indiana Jones. Aliens! Keep it contained within the four walls of your bedroom mr. Lucas. Karen Allen brought back into the action with no use to her being in the movie at all, great actors like mr. Hurt and Winstone who make nothing else but a fool out of themselves and are completely thrown to waste. Even the infallible Cate Blanchet seems to die in beauty. Harrison's still got the goods physically but the old flame has died, the real Indy spirit is completely lost, even in him, which doesn't need to be a problem but tailer make the film more to it!!!! The question remains: Why in heaven's name had this film to be made? Let's hope it'll be buried and never in a thousand years found, so that people in the future will remember Indy the way he should be, contrary to the people who've witnessed this failure, for whom the image of a once great hero, is forever ruined.

Leaving his hair grey and joking of his aging gave this completely unrealistic action-flick some realism. Overall the movie is an action packed, special effect overloaded story about aliens that chilled with the Incas/Mayans????!!! WHo thought of the plot??? And I'm sure that when Lucas was writing about the spaceship, the monkeys at the end and thought of the crazy, tripping Oxley character he was on some serious drugs! Ho, and the with the money and talented people involved in the movie surely they could of made the skull look more impressive and the scene with Indy's son getting hit in the balls more realistic.

1417,numberdude,hmmmm...,7,27 May 2008,"OK. Im a pretty big fan of the Indy series and when Ifound out that they were making no.4, was pumped. I saw the film and Yeah, like everyone else, there is mixed reactions to the film. Pros: As a continuation on from the last (being 20 yrs ago) it was good that it was set 20 later so Indy was aged proportionally to the whole time line.Also good to see that after the Nazis defeat during the 40s, they have ceased to be a actual enemy of the times of the 50s, thus bringing in the Russians.Was good to see (Like all the others) the movie focused around a artifact with 'magic' or 'supernatural' properties from both a different religion and race. The whole UFO thing tied in OK with the Eldorado's theme in being that the country does have the massive ground drawings and based upon the myth of the city of gold, could be plausible in movie world that the aliens helped the race prosper and thus be able to create a city from gold or filled with the artifacts from around the world, the the skull becoming sought after.Also good in the respect that it kind of tied up the last loose ends of the series by bringing back Marianne. Cons Some scenes were just unbelievable such as when the kid was swinging with the monkeys? ?? Please! yeah I know that it is suppose to be like a comic-style adventure but really...that probably matches Lion, witch and the wardrobe when that little brat rides the lion. An atomic blast is survivable in a fridge??? Keep that in mind but make sure its lead lined Bit far fetched in the respect. Also the use of CGI was a bit too much. Should have stayed closer to lavish sets with real action sequences like the others-just makes for a classier finish. Apart from that, the movie is enjoyable and entertaining with many a good point. Don't know how re-watchable it is compared to its predecessors, but still worth a look into...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The movie I must say was great, the formula for all Indian Jones movies is still there. The movie had action it had thrills and it had bugs. The story, however, without giving too much away had too much Sci-Fi. There are good twists though and we see old friends. I was really glad to see Indy again. Harrison Ford Performs this title as if it was 1 year after The Last Crusade. I left the theater knowing it could have been better, but this is a movie I would still get on DVD.

Spoilers, both of you Steven and George, Damn spoilers.",2,21 May 2008,"This is not Indiana Jones; this is Henry Jones introducing (SPOILER) Mutt Jones. This is a precursor to Young Indiana Jones starring Shia LaBeouf coming out sometime in the future; this is less archaeology and more technology, which if handled well could have been an interesting blessing but unfortunately went for cheap thrills and obvious even repetitive action. This film is more soap and adventure, thus lacking charm, and is an introduction to Indiana after the death of his father where he has now become just Henry Jones; the soapy pay off is that he now has a son and low and behold can become like his father before him; leading to Young Indiana Jones. We have another Phantom Menace on our hands. Capitalisation over content. There are some nice touches (about three classical Indie moments; lends itself to be more paying homage to the old films than being a new one.) 1st More Russians please and less Gophers; vine swinging monkey good guys and gusts of breeze through church doors for quirky family jibes at how Young Indiana Jones Sequel is so imminent. 2nd More apt title please Indiana Jones and the Blingdom of Crystal Dull Indiana Jones and the Jar Jar Binx Affair.

I do like the inclusion of history but somewhat frigging OTT. Apart from the door not coming open maybe he could have left some eggs in the fridge and upon landing opened up -a SMEG fridge- and reveal himself covered in the eggy contents boosting the ridiculous injoke facterino. I love the overall cheesiness of Indie, but this is Indie without the charm. Marion (God I love her in Raiders) and Indies relationship goes into a settle down get married territory. She is a precursor for LaBeouf and their relationship is thrust on us rather than developed. I want to root for Indie not have to find my footing. Indie doesn't get married either, that didn't happen... Oh dear they really have screwed this up.This wasn't escapism it was aggravation. As for the adventure I think I picked it apart, like a geek, maybe I should see it again without so much built up expectation and loving want, but right now I feel so, so whipped off.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1420,jdawgnoonan,A nice return to an old favorite.,8,22 May 2008,"I grew up on the Indy movies and the first three films rank amongst my favorites. The actors all did great work. Harrison was believable as an aging Indy and I liked the aging Indy. Mutt was good as well, and could potentially carry the series forward.The only real problem with the movie was not the alien theme but all of the, ""They aren't going to space the are going to the space between space,"" mumbo jumbo at the end. I think that trying to wax philosophic at the end is dumb. Maybe the characters understand what they mean since they have peered into the eyes but we, the audience, do not understand. Also, I wish Indy walked away at the end like in ""Raiders."" He isn't the world's nicest guy and there could still be one more film if I read the hat at the end correctly.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I saw this movie the day it came out and for the first twenty minutes the only thing keeping me watching was hope; hope that it would get better. The acting wasn't too bad with the usual good performance from Harrison Ford and most of the main cast, even Shia LaBeouf gave a decent show.It is my belief that George Lucas had more of an impact on this film than Stephen Spielberg. The movie was packed full of unnecessary amounts of CGI and huge plot holes. The main story wasn't as Indiana Jones as it should have been and took the quadrilogy a step in the wrong direction.That being said, it does deliver most of what is expected of an Indiana Jones movie; gratuitous, over the top fight scenes, Indy using his whip, a lot of near-miss escapes and as much other action that could be packed into a movie as possible.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1422,quicksilver4224,This Movie Is Good But Not A Classic,10,28 May 2008,"This movie is a good movie that can't be compared to the original trilogy. Coming out 19 years after The Last Crusade you can't walk into the theaters expecting this to be another Raiders. Much less expect it to contain no CGI when we are in the middle of an age of digital effects. This is a good movie for what is coming out these days. Yes the ending was out of place in a way because of the ""aliens"" or inter-dimensional beings, but what would you expect from an Indy film. They are supposed to deal with somewhat supernatural things. Harrison Ford made a good come back as Indy. And Shia Leboeuf does a great job as Mutt Williams (or for those who have seen it Henry Jones the III).If you go to see it think of it as the beginning of something new and you will see it is a very good movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1423,agmor1,Disappointing,6,25 May 2008,"Raiders of the Lost Ark remains a seminal genre film. The 1981 action-adventure film cemented George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's place as the world's best purveyors of mass entertainment, delivering a rollicking yarn, sweet romance, genuine laughs and non-stop thrills. Spielberg described the style as ""Michael Curtiz meets Walt Disney,"" but Lawrence Kasdan's sharp, witty screenplay was more Casablanca than Cinderella- it created a hero arguably as iconic as Bogart in Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones and placed him into atmospheric, stylish 1930s locales, commencing with one of the greatest supernatural sequences of recent memory. Raiders inspired not just two memorable sequels in The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, but an entire subgenre of adventure films so hopes were high after 19 years for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.The year is 1957. The plot has something to do with Erich Von Daniken's theory that alien visitors gave ancient civilisations their technology, and that remnants of these visits remain in South America. It is difficult to continue deploying Nazis as the baddies after the war so screenwriter David Koepp has thrown in those dastardly Soviets to keep Indy on his toes.And it works. At least, initially. The terrific opening sequence (featuring teenagers drag-racing American jeeps) sets an exciting retro tone. In fact, early scenes involving all forms of '50s clichés like nuclear tests and mysterious Government warehouses are executed with intelligence and considerable flair. Shia LaBeouf cements himself as a genuine star in a fun chase sequence around Yale University; the scene itself is well staged and directed with a Raiders-style reality.But the film introduces too many characters and arcs to satisfactorily explore each element. Reliable Brits John Hurt, Jim Broadbent and Ray Winstone pop up in support, whilst Karen Allen makes a return as Indy's first (and best) leading lady Marion Ravenwood. Did I mention that Indy becomes a victim of Red hysteria? And that Cate Blanchett features as a Russian psychic, a plot point that seems to be later forgotten? Koepp's work seems such an amalgam of earlier screenplays that the material often seems enough for another two movies (for instance, the Soviet's obsession with telepathy felt more Himmler than Stalin).The entire production feels rather toothless compared to the sharp wit of Raiders, the atmospheric darkness of The Temple of Doom or the warmth of The Last Crusade. The screenplay is funny in the back-and-forth between Ford and LaBeouf, but Spielberg's film fails to maintain any sense of believability as it soon descends into cartoonish and implausible set pieces: scenes involving Tarzan-style heroics seem better suited to a Star Wars film whilst the CGI creations have nothing on the real creepy crawlies of earlier films.It is also irritating that the film spends so much time discussing the origins of the Crystal Skulls, and yet their actual powers remain frustratingly unclear. There is some guff about their being the ""destroyer of worlds,"" but the plot leads to an ending that prompts more confusion and bewilderment.The cast do what they can with the material. After the likes of Hollywood Homicide, Ford makes a terrific return to form with a sly and charming performance, fully of grizzled charm and surprising athleticism. LaBeouf makes for a worthy sidekick and it is fun to seen Marion Ravenwood again after 27 years. Unfortunately, Blanchett's campy shtick soon gets old. The original trilogy featured shaded and appealing villains of layering and dimension, epitomised by Paul Freeman's charismatic mercenary Rene Belloq, a villain closer to Indy than our hero would like to admit. Comparatively, Blanchett is a panto-style villain who feels like more of a pest than a real (or Red) menace.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a good movie; it is leaps ahead of the garbage that seems to litter the action genre these days (National Treasure¸ The Da Vinci Code, Fools Gold). But this is clearly not the film it could have been, and is the series' poorest entry. Disappointing.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1424,aesthetic_factor,Must See In Order To Appreciate Raiders Of The Lost Ark..,2,14 June 2008,"Out of the whole saga of Indiana Jones this movie felt like A desperate attempt to rekindle the magic of the first one. If you never seen the first movie but saw this one I would suggest watching Raiders of the Lost Ark. You will see were these over produced subsequently lame CGI stunts and ideas came from and be instantly thrilled with these action bits that had substance compared to the fast motion, beyond human stunts applied in this one. In this new movie Indiana Jones and his disciple must have been Jedi's!? 80% of this movie is a copy cat but poorly done. It's kind of like watching the Simpsons when they pull a spoof out of a respected memorable film in order to apply nostalgia and humor from a great movie or event. George Lewcus and Steven Speelburg must be laughing all the way to the bank. They just did this sell out to collect an easy paycheck from the corporates and fans. The first movie they made with passion that gave movie critics a recognition of their brilliant creativity which must have been used up in the first three, most of it in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1425,treders,Indy's never been on finer form!,8,7 June 2008,"I don't get what all the criticism is. Sure it might not re-capture the magic of Raiders as we'd hoped, but with a classic like that, and over-hyped expectations, it's as good as it will get!!! Cool acting, great set-pieces, a memorable opening and complex plot already add up to a strong summer which can only get better! I thought Shia gave quite a special performance and while I won't give anything away, there may just be another sequel waiting in the line??Luckily this doesn't ruin it in the way that the SW prequels did, and what's more some of the action might have been slightly unrealistic, but in an era with Mummy's and Die Hards, Spielberg made the right choice in the end!Now Mr Lucas, please can you retire and stop trying to rape franchises",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1426,how_peculiar,Biggest disappointment since 'The Phantom Menace',5,22 May 2008,"Before we go any further, I'd like to make one thing clear: I am a HUGE Indiana Jones fan. I LOVE the first three films, 'Raiders' being one of my all-time favourites.Right. Now that I've gushed suitably about my adoration for what was, until recently, referred to as a trilogy, let's focus on the monumental disappointment that is 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'.In the run-up to the film's release we have been continually reassured by the production team that the use of CGI has been kept to a bare minimum. This, I have to say, is utter balls. The opening shot features a CG gopher (yes, that's right, a CG sodding GOPHER).The characterisation of Indy feels completely off, which is a shame as Ford still seems more than capable of delivering the goods. I know he's considerably older than the last time we saw him, but he just seems far too mellow, for want of a better word.Other performances are equally weak: Cate Blanchett lacks any real menace as the villain of the piece. Shia LeBeouf and Ford share no real chemistry to speak of. Ray Winstone really stretches himself by playing a ""cockney geezer"" for a change. Karen Allen seems to have lost the ability to act since we last saw her in 'Raiders'. And John Hurt was just bloody annoying. More often than not, the screen feels crowded, the main action having been divided among far too many principal players.The script is dull and doesn't feature the level of humour we've come to expect from the preceding three adventures. There are attempts at humour (the aforementioned gophers, an awful Tarzan-esquire moment that sees LeBeouf swinging through the jungle with a group of monkeys) but most of it just winds up feeling toe-curlingly awful. In interesting sub-plot involving the FBI is introduced early on in the film, but it never goes anywhere and gets lost in the absurdity that follows. Let's pray they're not planning to tie that one up in another sequel of this calibre.The action sequences have no real pace, any sense of actual 'danger' having been completely jettisoned by Spielberg's shameful overuse of CGI. This, along with repeated ""Ow, I've been hit in my balls"" jokes completely ruins a potentially exciting sword fight between LeBeouf and Blanchett.Just when you think things couldn't possibly get any worse, they actually do. The finale with the flying saucer and the aliens is just awful. I can't go on about it too much as I still CANNOT BELIEVE that the film ended this way. It's just too painful to think about.Having said all that, there were one or two good points: Unsurprisingly, John Williams' music was great. The motorbike chase was fantastic. Wow, I can't actually think of anything else. I guess I was being literal when I said ""one or two good points"".In all honesty, I'm still reeling from the shock of this film. Last year Spielberg said that this film was ""for the fans"". Well, as a life-long Indy fan, I feel insulted. Judging by this, it would seem that the 'Berg has completely lost touch with ""the fans"". Admittedly, I am being overly generous by awarding it 5 out of 10. I'm desperately trying to think of a few more redeeming features, but the sad truth is that there weren't any.Oh yeah... The janitor out of 'Scrubs' was in it!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1427,skerd777,Indy did it again.,10,14 June 2008,"This movie is excellent! The script is well done (because you still have Indiana Jones' sarcastic side), the directing is well done (all the camera angling, fight scenes, and special effects), and the acting is well done. Shila buff was amazing, and Harrison Ford proved no matter what age he is he will always do a good job as Indiana Jones.The story line was genius and the ending was great! While watching the movie, it wasn't as predictable as to what was going to happen next. It kept you guessing the whole way through, and that kept the excitement going throughout the whole two hours.It wasn't boring, and the acting felt real that the relationship between the cast was real, which reeled the audience in.I rate this movie a 10/10 its a must see action/adventure film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I love em. since Starlog had an article about the 4. film on it's way (10 years ago) I've been looking forward to this...and it just broke my heart. I starts of In an unusual way in that we are not introduced to Indy through an unrelated self contained adventure, but it was a real good start. He was old but it worked. Then it took a turn for the worse and just spun off till' it ended with a flying saucer.. I don't care, an Indiana Jones film does not have aliens in it!! I mean just drop dead with that idea!At times the humor was silly to the point that it violated reality ie. Mutt swinging from tree to tree like Tarzan/ Marion driving into the tree/ the fencing on the driving cars.Janusz Kaminski did just not at all capture the old Douglas Slocombe look from the previous films. ""Not much cgi was used"" yeah right, it looked awful.The ultimate fate of Mac was just a copy of Elsa from the ending of ""Last crusade"". The cgi cartoonish end of Spalko was just as predictable as could be.The reuse of the grail theme for the ending was very unoriginal as it wasn't justified by the storyline. I could go on and on but this experience has made me tired. I really thought ""If anyone know how to bring a legend like this back it's Spielberg"" guess I was wrong.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1429,Kudosa,Omg Seriously !!,2,20 November 2008,"After 20 minutes I just couldn't watch any more. For a Lucas Speilburg movie this sucked Its badly acted, poorly written, and so boring. The visual effects team did a god job but nobody else did. Can they please just give up the return of the Star Wars movies was proof enough that Lucas's days are over, they were so reliant on effect that the whole feeling was lost. This feels like the same kind of thing. no doubt they will quickly do another two sequels for good measure or a new cartoon but Im all out of love for Indy now. But then I guess he is at the age where he just don't care about solid plot lines, great acting and epic scenery. Its truly all about money and box office clout just remake anything that was popular once and that will do. Shame on you George (bored) LucasTruly disappointing !",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1430,paul-michels-2,Better than the Temple of Doom and a great addition to the series.,8,31 May 2008,"Don't get me wrong, Crystal Skull has many flaws. But I've already seen it twice, and I loved it even more the second time. The first time coming out, I thought it was okay and a decent addition to the series. I went home and watched the Temple of Doom after already seeing the other ones. Temple of Doom wasn't one of my favorite movies, but I liked it a little bit better this next time I saw it. Anyway, finally seeing all three films together in such a long time and going to see the fourth movie again with my buddy who is a huge Indiana Jones fan, I found myself enjoying Crystal Skull even more. It has a great story, great characters, and Indy is just the same as ever, just maybe a bit older. I mean yeah the fridge, monkeys, and the Mac character are a little annoying but it mulls over the second time and you're already used to it, knowing the story that's about to unfold. Sure this movie isn't as brilliant as Raiders or the Last Crusade but it has the spirit and the rhythm and is a brilliant film for its genre. I think people go in expecting too much and that's the problem. I consider myself a bit more prepared seeing what Lucas did with Star Wars (though Revenge of the Sith wasn't bad) and figure it could have been much worse. Thank goodness for Spielberg's input and directing. Anyway, I highly recommend seeing this film. It is a bit more sci-fi than the others, but I also think Spielberg and Lucas are making homage to the B movie sci-fi pictures of the 50's. If you love the trilogy (which I'm guessing you do), you can also see the small homages to them as well. Definitely seeing Temple of Doom after so long, made me love Crystal Skull even more. It gives you that complete feeling coming out of the theater and you know that in your heart, Crystal Skull was better than Temple of Doom and a great summer movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1431,miketurnham,Disappointing!!!,3,22 May 2008,"I've not long returned from the cinema, having watched the forth instalment of the Indiana Jones saga and I feel like I've been on the receiving end of an Indy fist fight! I am gutted! This is probably (sad to say) going to be the biggest disappointment I have all year.There are so many flaws in this film that any entertainment value you may be able to muster, is completely overshadowed by the lack of expectations met.The biggest let down for me, is the performance by Ford, while he does well with the action scenes he was given to work with, the delivery of his lines are passionless and emotionally monotonous.The rest of the cast jostle for screen time and never get the opportunity to develop, especially Marion and Spalko. Which made the relationship between Marion and Indy feel rushed and insincere, and the rivalry between Indy and spalko is equally lack-lustre.I could have got on board with the story, (a brave decision, to go sci-fi, 50's b-movie) had it not been completely ruined with an awful ending, most likely selected by monkeys throwing there own faeces at a selection of alternate endings, mailed in by Buffy the vampire slayer fans.Then there's the use of CG. Well it was inevitable, and used in place of matte paintings, scale model scenery, mine car chases what have you, it would be welcome. But for some bizarre reason, the film is overrun by CG animals and insects. This completely takes away any aspect of fear or peril instilled by such scenes as the snake pit in raiders and the insects in doom.Overall this just didn't feel like an Indy film to me, even john Williams seems to have phoned in a bland soundtrack which was instantly forgettable.I would even go as far as saying the Star wars prequels didn't let me down this much. where I kind of appreciated that Star Wars is first and foremost a kids film series, Indy for me, while a part of my childhood, has matured with me over the years.As Indy says ""it ain't the years kid, its the mileage"", i sadly wont be getting a lot of mileage out of this one....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1432,cybermage,Great summer movie,10,24 May 2008,"Indy's back--with a vengeance. In my humble opinion Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull is classic Indy. A roller coaster ride of a movie with uncountable classic moments: Area 51, Indy thinking about the past in his study, the motorbike chase, the graveyard fights, finding the tomb, Indy and Marion meet for the first time in years, Indy finds out he has a son, the jungle car chase (an instant classic), and so much more. Some ""true fans"" (whoever they are) say that some scenes are way over the top (nuclear bomb/fridge, the three waterfalls), but I happen to disagree: Indy has always featured over-the-top action scenes. Skull simply is in line with the previous films. In other words: I don't get the hate some people have for Indy IV---it was classic entertainment, pure nostalgia. It delivers 100%.

Lost, Legendary city?? yeah thats passable for an Indie film but Space ships?? Come on!! But as soon as that city started to crumble all i could see was the mummy and their trying to escape this was then reinforced with the greedy character trying to grab gold. However Visually amazing it was, it's just no possible to substitute storyline, plot, themes with Special effects. It doesn't work.

I enjoyed this film as much as I did when I saw the original in the theaters when released, remembering it is a sequel to that film. It had adventure, intrigue, a few disgusting things and I have to say the Shia LeBouf was the most exciting young actor I have seen in 20 years. He held his own and maybe some day the hat will be passed...until then, Harrison still had it for me and the entire cast was brilliant. An Oscar contender?

Though containing good acting from all players, the special effects were only passable by today's standards. The action was nothing new, and nothing to sink your teeth into. The storyline's pacing progresses as if Lucas is trying to shove it down your throat and force you to accept it.Once a major Lucas fan, over the past decade he's making me begin to lump him in with the likes of Uwe Boll.

The older movies were mildly cheesy as well, and had their fair share of sci-fi folklore, and that's what this movie does. I know people were disappointed by the whole aliens thing, but to tell the truth, it had to be done to explain the mystery of the crystal skulls. Everything they said about them is true -- even with today's technology we don't know how they made them. And the fact that they popped up all over the world raised questions. The only part I didn't like was the very end, but other than that I was OK with the alien plot. It was deeper than that. All in all, though, it was great acting, classic Harrison Ford, Shia Lebouf did a great job -- although I don't know whether a spin off for Mutt Jones is a good idea -- but it was very entertaining and it stayed true to the attitude and attributes of the other Indiana Jones movies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I was thrilled to learn that the movie was being made and had a release date. I was also thrilled to learn that Karen Allen was to return.I have to admit, Indy's age was the hardest thing for me to get over. Even though I had seen Harrison Ford so much beforehand, it was jarring for me to see him older on the big screen. It wasn't until the action began that I started getting comfortable.I also had to get used to Indy in a different era. Instead of fighting Nazi's during the glamorous 40's, Indy was living in the nuclear era, dealing with the Russians and punks on motorcycles.While the beginning of the movie is a bit long, once the action began, I was on the edge of my seat with excitement.I really liked Shia and thought the idea that Indy had a son was great. Karen Allen looked fantastic and she and Harrison still had the old chemistry.The only problems I had with the movie was the fact that first, there were 2 swear words. I know it sounds prudish, but since there weren't any in the first movie, I felt it was unnecessary to have it in this one.The second involved the whole Alien theme through the movie, as well as it's outcome. It just didn't sit well with me.What I loved about the other Indy's was that even though the plots were fantastical, it was also based in some historical fact. The Alien plot was just plain corny.Don't let anyone fool you into thinking this is the worst movie ever. It's not. It's pure enjoyment. Lacking in all that fake CGI crap that your constantly being force fed. It's just plain old fashioned fun.I loved the outcome of the movie and felt it was a perfect ending. Go see the movie.

There are many unique challenges that face a film that resurrects a beloved cultural icon after 19 years, but the likes of Steven Spielberg & Co. showcase their immense talents by delivering a film that recaptures the magic.A 65-year old Harrison Ford slips back into the role of Indiana Jones like an old pair of jeans. Steven Spielberg is able to bring back his same exciting directorial style as he had in the first three films. And similarly, John Williams provides another brilliant score that is similar in its style and feel to the first films.David Koepp's script provides a wealth of wit and amusement, along with a touch of emotion. Lucas's story is clever mix of legend and fiction, even if the general plot line is reminiscent of the preceding Indy films.This film contains the benefits of modern technology with the use of digital effects......but still retains some amazing physical sets and stunt work, for which is a staple of the Indiana Jones series. What results from the blend is an impressive visual spectacle. It looks like an Indiana Jones made in 2008, but it still looks and feels like an Indiana Jones movie.I also feel compelled to add that this a lighthearted action/adventure film. The Indy films are based on the Saturday serials of the 30's and 40's that George Lucas loved as a kid. These movies encompass that innocent spirit. The Indiana Jones seres is escapist entertainment at its best.........'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is an excellently crafted film that reaches a similar level of quality set by its predecessors.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1441,loveuabhij,Steven's Worst!,1,26 May 2008,"I haven't seen any of the previous titles. But really didn't like this one. Lots of ideas are like copied from Treasure 2...But treasure 2 is much better and feels realistic. This one is like a kids' movie. Added some useless comedy. Doesn't seem anything realistic... It started up well and built some interesting ideas till Indiana meets Mutt. But once they are together, it has cut shorted lots of sequences and no realistic moves. The ideas of lost cities and archaeologist are always rocking and demand audiences. But still it greatly lacks originality and new idea. But the final plot if pretty nice. I liked the whole mechanism of sand and staircase. Never expected this one from Steven..",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1442,blueelecteenfilms,Indy is Back!,9,23 May 2008,"I have been hyped up for this movie ever since they revealed that it was in the making. Now that I have seen it, I am still reeling from the experience, and it is gradually sinking in how much I liked this movie. The cinematography and tone are unique from the previous Indy films, so please go into the theater without expecting another 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. The film opens with an excellent and suspenseful action sequence, though some of it will definitely raise eyebrows for being over-the-top. Nevertheless, this opening sequence is a *cough* blast. From then on, despite some longer sections of exposition and investigation, the action almost never stops. Some of the scenes are violent and intense, but they manage to maintain a lighter tone. I would compare this film to 'Last Crusade' in that regard. The dialog is usually light-hearted, and there is a lot more of it in this film than any of the previous installments. One downfall of this is a feeling of aimlessness or confusion that takes over, especially near the end of the movie. Harrison Ford recaptures his role quite well, but the character is portrayed as cautious and wise in contrast to the recklessness that he shows in ""Temple of Doom"". Shia LaBeouf plays a greaser-type young man, and he plays very well off of Harrison. Cate Blanchett's role as Irina Spalko is sinister and evil, but not explained very well and is not as deep as, say, Belloq from ""Raiders"". Karen Allen makes a pleasant, but not very emotionally stirring return as Indy's old flame Marion. It was a pleasure to see her on screen, since in my opinion she was the best Indy love interest of the original trilogy. The McGuffin itself, however, is pretty disappointing. The Crystal Skull is never fully explained, nor is it told why exactly it must be returned to Akator. The nature of the artifact is also very different from the three artifacts in the trilogy, and once you see the film you should understand why. The conclusion of the film was not very satisfying, but I have a suspicion that this is intended. After letting the experience sink in, I would rate the Indy films in this order:1 Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 The Last Crusade 3 Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 4 Temple of DoomNot the best, but not the worst. Go for a good time, but don't expect a classic or a deep plot.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1443,cyanidesyn,Unrealistic But...,9,24 May 2008,"bloody entertaining. i wish people would stop picking movies apart for their realism. It's Indiana Jones for Christ's sake! when were those movies ever realistic with their magic whips that do everything? it's an entertaining movie, it's a nice reminder of the good old days when action movies were fun and entertaining and could make jokes, like Demolition Man and the like. Movies are becoming too serious. I go to the movies to escape reality, not get depressed about real life issues. Granted some movies that are about real life issues are very very good...but sometimes i just need something to ENTERTAIN me. Brilliant movie despite the unrealism. ~~~~~POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW~~~~~ And honestly...if your complaining about the fridge...its a joke...when they used to tell people to hide in their fridges in case of nuclear attack...hell they used to say hide under a desk! yeah its unbelievable that he survived it (more the fridge crashing about rather than the radiation and stuff) but it was amusing, it was a joke, it wasn't meant to be real, accept it and enjoy the movie for what it is...ENTERTAINING AND LIGHTHEARTED!!! i wasn't disappointed one bit, in fact i was very surprised at how good it was :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1444,andrewdflint,Excellent Film,10,4 July 2010,"This film was great seeing back Harrison ford dressed up as Indiana Jones was simply amusing. I do not know why this movie is being criticized i mean according to meta critics and rotten tomatoes this movie received a 77% not bigger than raiders of the lost ark with 94% and the last crusade with 85% and the second with 74%. The movie is based on the mysterious Krystal skulls which truly exist and the aliens that appeared in the film is a theory and it also explains the reason why the Mayans disappeared so mysteriously from our planet leaving the Aztecs and Incas. the Mayans habituated in Mexico but they also habituated in the nazca paintings zone in Peru. Many of this buildings found in Peru are in fact Mayans. Another thing is that the legend of el Dorado has also three versions or theories: 1)the city of gold found in Peru as the movie shows. 2)the city of gold located inside the jungles of Cuba shown in the path to el Dorado movie and in the great video game uncharted:drakes fortune. 3)finally located in the jungles of Colombia according to the legend many of the gold was thrown to the rivers of the Magdalena to receive a blessing.

1445,dialed520,CG Nightmare Comes True,1,27 May 2008,"They did it to the SW franchise so I guess you can't be shocked that Lucas/Spielberg would ruin IJ4 in the same way. Not only was the CG terribly distracting and unnecessary, but the characters fell flat, even Marion Ravenwood and Indy couldn't find the same spark they had in the original. Ill focus on the CG, which is my major gripe.I hate CG when it isn't used when only absolutely necessary. If I wanted to watch a video game I'd turn on my PS3. Its lazy film-making, unauthentic, cheesy, annoying as hell, and insults your intelligence.My list of things that shouldn't have been in CG (*or in the flick at all):*prarie dogs - The first scene of the arrival at the warehouse / indy's intro - the inside of the warehouse - the magnetized gunpowder that flies in the air like a swarm of bugs - *a flying refrigerator - the entire jungle chase scene - *ants - *monkeys swinging with Mutt - the truck jumping on a tree, landing softly, then rebounding to smack ruskies - *three waterfall drops - *mayan magical jigsaw puzzle motorized stonehenge palace thing - *any sort of alien (hell since they're so lazy im surprised it wasn't E.T. that showed up)I give the lowest rating not because its the worst movie ever made, but because all they had to do was stay just a little bit true to the originals and they just couldn't. Lucas/Spielberg gave us a fantasy that feels like it was dreamed by a meth-head hyped up on a 3-day binge with too much money.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The comedy was spot on with every one liner hitting and causing a rumble of chuckles in the packed out cinema. The action was intense, Indy looked youthfull despite his ageing body and he can still certainly crack that whip good and hard. The ending was perfect, i could see it coming though but it was even better than i thought... don't want to give the game away but wowsers...I paid to see this twice and only got to see it the once.... it was worth every penny and then some.Thank you Mr Spielberg.

Hmmmmmm ummmm @#*% it! 2 more cause I can't give Indiana Jones a 3 :O( If i picture Dr Jones in my mind i see him on his own exploring some old dig-site or other historical place and after some exploring all of a sudden he rolls into adventure. Some other things that made the old movies marvelous. It was pure: Indy got into trouble he does some real quick thinking and solves the problem with something plain and simple but therefor genius. A couple of Mano a Mano fights. Action and adventure scenes with in between some dull research. Which makes it all look like it could have been possible. I place blame solely on Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. I take that back I should blame the horrible mental illness that they have both come down with over the past 10 years. Chew on this... If our athletes retire when they can no longer compete then why don't Spielberg and Lucas. I thank them for the wonderful classic films they made but what they have done to #1 SAGA's is painful. Please stop Steven and George and I promise to buy a copy of Star Wars 4,5,6 and Indy 1,2,3 once a year until I die.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1448,bubblecloudfilms,Just as Good as the Originals,9,4 January 2009,"***FEW SPOILERS*** Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an very wonderful and enjoyable movie. The plot is wonderful and the action is amazing. It has the same feeling as the originals and is just as good, if not better. Some people do not know, but George Lucus and Steven Spielberg wanted the movie to have a ""B"" Movie feel to it. The dialouge was excellent. The movie has a SciFi overtone and is played out nicely. The only element to this movie that I truly did not like was the villain. The villain was bland and boring and didn't scare you at all. People say things about the ending, but the ending is just fine and is very good. Over all the movie is excellent and is a great movie for popcorn and soda. This is my second favorite Indy flick only lower than the Temple Of Doom. People talk about how tame this one is, well, they are right, it was indeed tame, but I don't think they should have toned it down just so kids would drag their parents to see it. There is no movie that needs violence to be good. I love this movie and will watch it again and again. Maybe Spielberg will be smart enough to make one last Indy Film and let it be one last Hurrah.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1449,jcb-1972,Crystal Bull,2,28 May 2008,"I've stopped short of going as low as 1 out of 10 purely because Spielberg is the director and you have to respect that. But what a mess, they should have left this series well alone. I could see the other people in the cinema were bored throughout and I dozed off at one point myself (falling asleep during an Indy film??? not possible surely).The absurdity and unbelievability of the film have already been detailed by many other readers. This in itself would be partially forgivable if the pacing of the film was more adept, or the story itself more coherent. However, it is impossible to feel any empathy towards these characters (even the ""goodies""), so one very quickly loses interest.Save yourself the money, wait for it to come out on network TV (although the CGI will probably look more ridiculous on small screen, rendering this film completely unwatchable).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1451,martyst-1,The best of the 10+ blockbusters hiatus,10,22 May 2008,"I saw this movie last night and being that it was Indi Jones i went in with high expectations. After seeing Rocky Balboa, Rambo and Die Hard 4 make pretty big comebacks i was excited to see what Lucas and co could come up with. I was not disappointed! Indi 4 to me was just as good as the old ones, if not better, it is far and away the better of the old school movies reprisals.Harrison Ford is yet again awesome as Dr. Jones. He plays the character like he did in the originals, funny, grumpy, smart and inventive. Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams is a great counterpart to Harrison's Indi, showing much of the same qualities of Ford's original Jones. Cate Blanchett, Ray Winston, John Hurt and Karen Allen reprising her role of Marion Ravenwood all create plausible and interesting characters who help to keep the story moving.Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and David Koepp have created a new Indiana Jones, with much of the same feeling as the old Indiana Jones, but have not opted with excessive unbelievable stunts and effects that most blockbusters nowadays have.If you're a fan of Indiana Jones see it!

1452,horselovertomorrow,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,8,25 May 2008,"Okay so I did not expect so much negativity (about this movie), but I suppose people were expecting a 4th Indiana Jones. What that comment means is, another movie like the last 3. Same character, same style, same everything. Um one, different time period 1930s vs 1950s, that means this movie will be different. Secondly different actors means that the characters will be different, even Harrison Ford acted differently, I mean come on he's getting up there in years and while I am 22 and I didn't even see him in his hey day I think he's a great actor now. Give the poor guy some credit! I think he did an awesome job; and while most of the reviews I saw on here took that into account a few just bashed the hell out of the movie and forgot that entirely. I also thought that Shia Lebouf was good as well and that this movie may help him to get better roles and give other people reason to think he may be more than just a B-list actor. While I agree that Huxley was not the best character acting wise he was good for his role. The reason he wasn't as strong? His character isn't supposed to have a big role. The guy doesn't show up until the end and he is mostly a plot device to lead the others to the cave, I mean the actor is a great actor (his name escapes me at this moment) but his role (physically) in this movie just isn't that big. The villains I admit weren't that impressive but well, they were mostly in groups and one shouldn't expect a lot from mobs in movies,ever. Cate Blanchett wasn't that round (as a character) but I don't think she was meant to be, but I think she was very good. I also think her character was more complex than some may give her credit for. She wanted knowledge and power, and she got what she wished for. But she just..well go see the movie and you'll understand. As for the mom I thought she was great, yes she could have been a bit better acting wise but I think she did a good job interacting with the other characters and it was great that they brought back her characters. As for the CGI it can be good, it can be bad, it can be horrible. It's all a matter of viewpoint. My viewpoint? It was good in this movie, and realistic. Sure the fight scenes were a tiny bit too long in spots but hey it's an action/adventure movie, if people are looking for deep plot then go find another movie. If they want perfect fight scenes then go make your own movie or whine to your friends not some movie website.

1453,ZheMole,How could we have come to this?,1,14 November 2008,"Like many posts in here, I grew up with Indy. I remember being fascinated by Raiders, and pretending to be Indy with my little brother being the sidekick....lol. So, naturally, I was excited and cautious at the same. I wondered if this would be the send-off Indy deserved or another crap sandwich combo served up by Hollywood's elite.Well, I guess I would like fries with that.......I do not think that there is a word that could truly describe how utterly disappointed I am in the film. How? Why? My only guess is that Hollywood has TRULY ran out of ideas for a ""good"" Indy script. If that is the case, which it apparently is, then we are all screwed.I will go on to say that I do understand that times are different and things change. But we are talking about one of the BEST 80's heroes and movie series ever....I would have much rather never had another Indy film made than have this steaming pile.Here are my only two suggestions: 1. If you grew up with Indy-don't do it. Pop in Raiders or Last Crusade and just try to remember the good times. Be happy you haven't been tainted with this.....abomination.2. If you did not grow up with Indy....enjoy the film!

Yes, it has quite a few unrealistic sequences but is still a great movie. Shia Labouef did a great job in this movie and did a great job entering his name into one of the great movie series ever made. I will say I enjoyed Raiders and Last Crusade more than Crystal Skull but it was still good. Its not by any means amazing or incredible but its Indiana Jones and it was good to see him in action again. I will say this. I think it stops here. Thats enough for Indy.

1455,chrishogg2000,Very entertaining,6,23 May 2008,"The mixed reaction from critics to this film is understandable as i feel that there were many flaws in this movie. A lot has been made of the introduction of aliens into the indiana jones franchise and whilst i can see why some people would be annoyed by this i don't think it takes too much away from the film. there were times when the plot was a little far fetched but this is indiana jones, its not meant to be taken seriously, previous films had story lines including a lost ark with gods power and the holy grail, a story about aliens is almost a natural progression.What did annoy me slightly is that whilst i can cope with a far fetched plot i was a little taken aback by how much time they spent developing the plot and explaining it. i thought more time should have been spent developing the characters and their relationships, especially the relationship of harrison ford and shia la beouf. I think their interaction was the main strength of the movie and i thought there was a lot of potential for spielberg to develop that even further, maybe he's saving that for possible sequels.The action sequences were amazing, i particularly liked the bit with the atomic bomb i thought that was great as it really gave the audience the feeling of the times that indiana jones was living in, the fear of communists and the fear of spies was worked well into the story.Having said that i didn't like the character of ray winstone at all and thought that he was pretty pointless in the movie. i wont give away what the progression of his character is but it just ended up annoying me when revelations about his motives were made.Aside from that the acting in the film was very good and harrison ford especially seemed to revel in returning to his former role. It was also fantastic being a fan of scrubs to see neil flynn popping up in a small role.A very satisfying film, extremely entertaining and doesn't disappoint if you aren't looking to take it too seriously.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1456,therealmatman,Indy returns! but were we ready?,6,27 May 2008,"everyone who loved the first three films would have surely had high hopes for this next film to be something spectacular, but we may have been let down somewhat this time.a few rants about the film: 1. It is revealed very bluntly that mutt is Indy's son as Marion just blurts it out without any regard for what mutt or Indy might say 2. Mutt's character is stupidly plonked into the film just because he is played by shia lebouf (or whatever his name is). I have nothing against him, just he seems to be getting greedy for parts, and this is film that he could have done with staying out of really. Also at some points he is seen randomly crying for no reason! 3. Russians?! why can't we have Nazis again? 4. CGI rodents! 5. The whole grease/back to the future setting of the film, didn't give it much of an edge, just made it seem quite cheesy and pretentious. 6. Can't the guy make up his mind whether he's a baddie or a goodie, that really got on my nips! 7.NO NUKE IS SAFE FROM THE MIGHTY FRIDGE!?!?!?!? good things about the film: 1. The Indy character is still there as we all know and love 2. There were some reasonable chase scenes 3. The idea of the skulls was quite well thought out, with a lot of coverage of the story behind them. 4. There was not much CGI on key scenes, unlike the star wars prequels where every scene possible was force fed inedible amounts of CGIout of all these points made, i consider this film to not be what was expected at all but rather a subdued Indiana Jones film that seemed to be less well handled that the first three films. 6/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

In this movie, Indy is overwhelmed by the world he lives in.I thought the action was pretty good. Ford looks AMAZING for a 65 year old guy. Hell, he could give anybody a run for their money! The chase scene in the jungle was alright. I thought they used too much cgi. NOT too crazy about the whole shia and the monkeys thing.The aliens were great. It's a funny thing... Indy looks so far back into human history( because he's an archaeologist) that he finds out aliens have to do with everything! I was really surprised to see Indy and Marion get married.

It takes away from the classics plots and changes it into one with aliens and mediocre fight scenes. The stunts are so unbelievable that it is hard to watch. This not only is the worst Indy move, but possibly one of the worst movies ever. With quotes like,""Not outer space, but the space in between space."" you can't help but laugh in mockery. The whole movie doesn't really make sense, it turns out that the whole gang basically did what they did just to help some old guy?

I loved it first time around, but now I have several problems with it. Half of me is shouting for another one, the other half is screaming 'rape! rape! This is as bad as Phantom Menace!!' The whole Alien aspect feels both brilliantly set up and symbolic on one hand, but cheesy and a silly cop-out on the other. It is very good, but it just doesn't fit. It feels a bit like winning the lottery after years of buying tickets then being kicked in the balls by the bloke holding the massive cheque. Look, it was worth the 20 year wait to be made to feel like a kid again, with the nuclear bomb escape almost as daft and unlikely as Temple Of Doom's dinghy-cum-parachute escape. But the ending feels a lot like the joke is on us. You could have cut the atmosphere in the cinema with a knife, it was as if everyone was just going 'Eh?!'. It just makes you wonder what was in the scripts they rejected, including Darabont's. I mean, how could Spielburg, Lucas and Ford so willingly risk alienating (excuse the pun) their audience like this!? Perhaps I'll feel differently when i watch it on the telly in a few years; I've honestly never felt so thrilled yet disappointed at the same time!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1460,rory_holder,"A New Time, A New Discovery, A New Indy!",7,22 May 2008,"A chaotic warehouse escape, nuclear explosions, jungle swashbuckling, man-eating ants, monkey men (almost too literally), and an ancient amazonian temple spectacle that is almost too strange to conceive. These are the makings of the long-awaited Indiana Jones installment, and as strange and twisted as the story is, it delivers.Nineteen years have passed since we last saw our iconic archaeologist, and though looks have changed slightly and setting/time have changed quite a lot, Indy couldn't be any more Indy than he was before. After a narrow escape from a top-secret military compound in 1957 Nevada, Indy returns back to his normal life as a university professor at Marshall College, only to find out that he is on edge of losing his job. Into the story comes Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf), who has lost touch of his old friend and father-figure, professor Oxley (John Hurt). Indy, who's known Oxley since his own college years, agrees to go with Mutt to the Amazon to find him and discover the mysteries surrounding his obsession with the legend of the crystal skulls.The same look, style, and attitude is nostalgic to the previous films every time you see Indy on screen, whether he's in a close-call escape, fighting one-on-one with a soviet thug, arguing with a mistrusting Mac (Ray Winstone) or the giddy Marion (Karen Allen), or just simply being professor Henry Jones, Jr. Marion Ravenwood returns to the screen, bringing not only her debating charm, but a few new surprises for Indy, as well. Newcomers to the series are the greaser Mutt, the delusional Professor Oxley, the deceptive Mac, and of course, the mysterious and intimidating femme fatale Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), each with their own unique personality that has Indy spinning in a whirlwind of problems.There are plenty of action sequences (some FAR more ridiculous than others), but that is precisely what makes the adventure in any Indiana Jones film. That's what we want. And as for story, it's got the same mythical legend tale to tell that all the previous films had (as strange as it is). Many longtime Indy fans will also be very pleased at the numerous amounts of references are portrayed to the old films.Overall, the movie may seem a bit over-the-top, and in many parts it is. But when you finish watching it and think about it, it's got that same style of storytelling as the previous films, subtle as it may be. It's imperative to realize the time and setting of the film. The original trilogy was closely knit together time-wise, spanning only three years between all three films. Now we are reentering Indy's life nineteen years down the road, and much has changed about his life and the world around him. So naturally, for that reason alone, this Indy film is going to FEEL different, but it's definitely heartwarming to know that Indy himself hasn't changed a bit, and that's truly what makes these films so adventurous and enjoyable.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1461,David-5008,Indiana should've stayed in retirement,3,23 May 2008,"What a disappointment. I was actually really close to leaving the theater towards the end. It had none of the cleverness and intrigue of the past installments. Hokey is the word that comes to mind. It was even worse than Temple of Doom. Whereas all the movies were based in reality with touches of the supernatural (Ark of the Covenant, Kali worshipers, Chalice of Christ) this new movie just stepped over the line into the land of ridiculousness. Completely unsatisfying ending to an already unbelievable succession of events. In the past movies Indiana Jone's intelligence and moxie allow him to find his goal, but in this movie he's pulled along and things just happen on their own so that he ends up in the right place and the right time.I'd seriously go on bashing this film if I had time.Shia Labouf is good, but can't do much with the script he's been handed. That'll teach him to sign on before he sees the pages.Ugh. It had a few fun moments, and made me nostalgic for the other Indiana Jones movies, which is was counting on, but came nowhere close to being as much fun.I give it a 3 out of 10.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1462,ryankpersaud,Flawed but still entertaining,7,25 May 2008,"It's unfortunate that the Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is so deeply flawed. The acting, the script, the action, the music...everything is a little weaker than it was back in the day. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't entertain. The action is still superlative, especially the jungle chase scene. Suffice to say, it is a blast watching Indiana Jones escape from a US military base as Soviet forces chase after him. It's fun to see a massive jungle chase scene, complete with giants ants, sword fights, water falls, and lots of gunning. Another chase scene has Indiana and Mutt escaping from Soviet agents through University campuses. The action is still entertaining to watch. However, the film has no heart. None at all. It's not as funny as I thought as it would be, the characters never establish any real relationships, and they're all static personalities. George Lucas is a shell of the writer he once was and cannot capture genuine emotion without hammy dialogue. Spielberg's imagination can run free and wild, but his over does on CGI, which is usually pointless, (especially with CGI gophers and monkeys) dampens the movie's fun.However, it is a trip back down nostalgic road, complete with over the top action sequences and genuine summer fun.

OK, so I went to the cinema, no big expectations, and then suddenly BANG! Good action sequences, a bit over the top, but it is refreshing to see such crazy action. A plot involving aliens? Unusual for an Indy movie, but let's see where this leads us. Russians instead of Germans? Oh well, WW2 is over, so i guess they are the next best thing.As I keep watching, the story gets more interesting, it pulls me in, the acting is better than i expected, Indy still has the old spark, the new characters are pretty good, Indys son is amuzing and the chemistry works between him and his father. The classic Indy humor is back, every joke is a direct hit. And at this point I am realizing that I am really enjoying this movie! I think that this film is not only a worthy follow up to the previous movies, but it is a really good movie. It is different from the other ones though. But honestly, what did you expect? It's not a classical Indiana Jones film, but how could it be? I mean, The Last Crusade is really a while back, a lot has changed since then. I know there was a lot of CGI, but it gave this movie a unique feeling in the Indy franchise. it has made it more play-full and more crazy than the previous movies. And I liked it for just what it is!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1464,piratemath-1,I won't enjoy the original trilogy the same way I did before.,3,7 June 2008,"It was good to see Indy again, but not this way. I don't even know where to begin .. a storyline that seemed like it was rushing us through, the obscure scene/location changes, or the absolutely ridiculous plot. I would write a long critique on this film, but I'm simply too tired from seeing it to even bother. I just want to warn the die-hard Indiana Jones fans ... it's not worth it to go back, unless you think telepathic pan-dimensional generic looking Aliens with a giant UFO are a fantastic place for the IJ series to go.I didn't think Lucas could escape the epic failure of the recent Star Wars trilogy without learning any lessons about cutting production costs by using computer graphics imagery. I really thought somebody would have stepped in and told him to do this right.I don't even want my money back. I just want to forget.This movie isn't for die-hard Indiana Jones fans.This movie is for kids who don't know the original trilogy enough to be able to make a distinction between it and this cheap ride.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1465,spartanl36,"Welcome back, Indy!",10,24 May 2008,"The trio of Spielburg, Lucas, and Ford has once again made an excellent movie! This movie was excellent, definitely my 2nd favorite Indiana Jones movie at least. As always, Harrison Ford does an excellent job in playing Indy. In fact, all the parts in the movie were played very well. Shia Labeouf proved his worth as an upcoming star with flying colors. I thought that the movie was very well balanced between a good story and good action, what with tense and exciting moments far too numerous to keep track of. Some people will not like the way this Indy film goes off the beaten path, but you have to admit that there are only so many religious artifacts to go after, and I therefore welcomed everything with open arms, and got back exactly what I expected: A fantastic Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1466,fwigurski,Epic (Indiana) Movie,2,23 May 2008,"The worse sequel ever. Script is bad, CGI is awful, acting in bad, editing is bad... It is like parody of Indiana films. Absolutely no 'Indiana' magic. I've liked John Hurt, I think he was the only one trying... Thanks Lucas and Spielberg - I will never in my live go to premiere again, I will wait a week and read reviews, so I don't waste another 12.5$ for such a garbage.I expect this movie in few moths in a 4.99$ DVD bin next to Battlefield Earth.I'm so disappointed...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1467,scm1991,i liked it,7,30 May 2008,"obviously this Indiana Jones isn't going to be as good as the old ones, that just isn't going to happen, but if you like indie then i would advise seeing this film.its rather predictable and there were a few things which i thought were stupid.i liked the fact that it was based around area 51 and aliens, as i am interested in other life forms etc.i guessed that the whole film would be based around aliens from the beginning seen as the first part is in area 51...overall i thought it was a good film so i would say go and see it!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1468,Luke444-1,"Some genuine entertainment to be had, but an over the top story line and weak script may leave some Indy fans disappointed",5,23 May 2008,"OK lets cut to the chase: Indy's latest instalment has George Lucas written all over it. From the moment the first CGI rodent pops onto the screen, the parallelisms between Indiana Jones 4 and the Star Wars prequels inevitably start to creep to mind. This isn't to say that these special effects drench the film, but I do feel they undermine the grittiness and, dare I say it, believability of the series. Sure, Indiana Jones saw and did some pretty amazing and 'out there' stuff in his previous films, but the plot always just about managed to keep its feet on the ground so to speak - never going too far.And this is one of my main criticism with Indiana 4 - it goes too far. It seems that Spielberg and Lucas are no longer content with the likes of mysterious religious artefacts; we've moved on to aliens. Yes, I was half expecting Jar-Jar Binks to turn up amongst the extraterrestrials and flying saucers in the film's conclusion. Is this - science fiction - really what Indiana Jones is, or should be, about? Whilst I'm very much a Star Wars and sci- fi fan, it's a definite 'no' from me.My other problem is the script. I frequently found myself cringing at the less than imaginative lines and weak jokes. In fact it was often difficult to tell what we were supposed to find funny and what was supposed to be taken seriously. Tarzan-esquire vine-swinging and attacking monkeys certainly springs to mind.But it's not all doom and gloom. Harrison Ford returns and believably reincarnates the character of Indiana Jones and, as consolation to the dodgy script, the acting from all the cast is high quality. There are certainly a decent amount of action sequences that, for the most part at least, work well. However I do agree with other opinions on how we rarely truly feel Jones and co are in danger, resulting in many sequences being less about suspense and tension, and more about choreography. There are moments in the film, such as the exploring of the cave in which the crystal skull is found, that do offer a level of atmosphere and suspense - if they were only accompanied with a sharper, more witty script then I would feel a lot better about this film.Overall, how seriously you take Indiana Jones will no doubt play a big part in how much enjoyment you get from this. Fans will likely feel at least a twinge of disappointment, whilst casual action-adventure movie fans will find this a perfectly entertaining experience. I feel that I may be being too harsh on The Crystal Skull, but then again I consider myself an Indy fan, and ultimately I dared to expect something far more than what was on offer.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1469,ogan13,Indiana Jones doesn't meet expectations,6,22 May 2008,So for starters i felt like this movie seemed a little undeveloped. It could just be me but i felt that the aliens were out of place and had no real meaning. Sure they are a bases for the crystal skull mystery but in the movie they seemed to have more importance then that. Like at the end when then return the skull to the chamber. the aliens seemed as to have no point so why include them. Another thing was the Henry Jones the 3rd. It was a good use of plot lining but it seemed as if it wasn't quite the best thing. Something Lucas dreamed up one night when writing the script. Also why include the nuclear test. it did nothing for the viewer. It seemed as though this seen was a filler for a story that could have been more developed. For the most part it follows your normal Indiana Jones storyline. He got caught and escapes many times. He runs through the African fire ants. The fire ants seen was well done but out of place for this movie. As for the dungeons it seemed as thought they through them together. I wanted something like in the temple of doom. Where you must find the temple which is very hard. Unlike other Indiana Jones movies he doesn't chase after the the relic as much. He finds the skull part of the way through the movie. He then quickly escapes and goes for the temple to return it. For the most part the story was over after this. I thought this was a little like the Star Wars episode 3. Lucas has ether lost his true form or is trying new angles and i don't think they are working. He should go back to his roots and make films again.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1470,s_rade02,"Could have been good, but was messed up.",2,22 May 2008,"In the previous Indiana Jones films there were also some supernatural things like the lost arc and the holy grail, so I didn't have anything against the (SPOILERS FROM HERE!) aliens. What really messes this film up is the lack of realism. Yes I know, the previous ones weren't realistic either, but in those Indi wasn't sitting in a fridge next to an atomic explosion. Then his son somehow transforms into Tarzan and leads an army of monkeys out of nowhere. Finally his wife drives her truck down a cliff, lands on a big tree growing out of the cliff, which bends down, sets her off on the ground, snaps back and hits the evil Russians climbing down the wall! I mean did no one notice how ridiculous those scenes are? Every time Indi enters a tomb, there are some guys with poisoned arrows covered in paint, hiding in the walls for no apparent reason. It's just so stupid, sometimes I felt like watching Charlie's angels. (Yes that comparison is brutal, and it is meant to be).Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, the music still rocks, Harrison Ford is still doing a good job as Indi, and it could have been a really great movie. But it was ruined with all these ridiculously exaggerated action scenes, and I understand Sean Connery for not wanting any part in this. I didn't expect much after Lucas ruined Episode 1-3, but I was still disappointed. So sad the last Indi film had to be like this.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1471,marauder-15,Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of We Still Have All Your Money!,1,22 May 2008,"I will start with a line in Latin, which sums all peer reviews up nicely: De gustibus non est disputandum. This literally translates as ""there is no accounting for taste"". In other words an opinion is an opinion and one can't dispute another's. That said, this film was a let down on so many levels. Having waited several hours in line I found more enjoyment in spending time with my friends talking about what this movie might have been rather than the actual viewing. To start, Aliens: best left in a genre by itself. Communists: Not as funny or fun to beat up as Nazi's. Monkeys: unrealistic CGI. Aliens: poorly done, unrealistic CGI. Acting: mediocre, though not as bad as some people say. Plot: about as in depth as the movie Battlefield Earth. Action: it's there but not nearly as much as prior Indiana Jones films. Sound Track: It's there to sell a soundtrack for the record companies. John Williams, what the **** were you doing? Harrison Ford: did you seriously read the script? What the **** were you doing?Basically, I sum this film up as the Battlefield Earth of Indiana Jones movies. Hyped up and horrible upon completion. If Scientology buffs want to take over Hollywood, just say so and that way I can stop wasting my time and money.

BUT REMEMBER THIS IS AN INDIANA JONES MOVIE!!! I did NOT grow up watching his movies since I am not that old, but I still know that Indiana Jones movies are like that, they pull out feats that NO ONE CAN! They do all this stuff and its just pure action combined with fantasy! So if your expecting something that is completely real, go see something at a play. If you want fun, action, and adventure go see this movie! I highly recommend this movie, and just have fun and enjoy it!

1474,Namu_San,Entertaining movie but could've been a LOT better...,6,23 May 2008,"This is my very first review on IMDb. I've never felt the urge to write a review before, but now that I've watched ""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" I needed a place or some way to vent my emotions and write down my thoughts... So here they are: First of all let me explain that, like most users that commented on this movie, I am a big Indy fan. I watched all three of the previous movies multiple times and I loved them (well maybe Temple of Doom not that much...) but it was one of those classic franchises that I grew up with, and I've always been very much attached to. Hell, watching Indiana Jones as a kid made me want to be an archaeologist when I grew up. That dream never happened, however.The dream that Spielberg and Lucas made me want to believe in, a dream of reliving the good old times with an Indy movie that would bring back those adventurous feelings I had in my childhood...That one (sadly, and I think most users here feel the same) also didn't happen. I went to the cinema expecting much, and got out a little disappointed...a little empty inside, not nearly as enthusiastic as I expected myself to be. Maybe I expected too much, but this is Indiana Jones we're talking about after all, with movie legends and classic Indy team Spielberg and Lucas behind the wheel. It's a movie that HAS to deliver, because the fans expect it to. You can't just revive a classic movie franchise after 19 years of absence and don't make sure it's everything it has to be. Because that's what people expect and wish for. Anything less is bound to disappoint.Now, I have to be clear about this: It's not actually that bad of a movie. As a standalone adventure/action movie I guess it can be considered quite enjoyable. If this movie had a different title and different characters and Harrison Ford didn't star in it, and if I watched it without knowing it was directed by Spielberg, I would've enjoyed it a lot more. It actually started quite promising, and (apart from that awkward and seemingly unnecessary over the top atomic explosion w fridge scene) remained quite good to great. Some say the quality of the movie's first part is by far superior compared to the second part and I have to agree with this. For me, everything started to go rapidly downhill from the jeep/boat car chase through the jungle onwards, and ended with a conclusion that left me perplexed (in a bad way) and wondering just how much it really had to do with 'Indiana Jones', as it was seemingly very far removed from the original thoughts, style and feeling the franchise stood for.My conclusion: This movie will probably disappoint most old school Indiana Jones fans, and that's something that shouldn't have happened. All in all, I think it's quite an enjoyable adventure movie (especially the first part) but could've (and should've) been a LOT better. Personally I think it's better than ""Temple of Doom"", but I know there are a lot of fans out there who will disagree and say KOTCS is the worst of the bunch, and I will perfectly understand that opinion. 6 stars from me, 5 of them are for the first 60 - 70 minutes of the movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1475,fishytv,Generally fun,8,23 May 2008,"Fun summer popcorn film.Lots of places make no sense. I'll comment on the first one in the movie. It opens with four folks in a hot rod, and they 'race' with an Army officer's car, a 1950 Ford.Lucas has written many times that he was nuts about cars as a kid, which lead to American Graffiti.The hot rod was only show a few times, it had a 32 Ford grill with the V8 logo, but it was not a flat head Ford V8, it looked to be a Chevy small block, or perhaps an Olds. The stock 1950 Ford coupe might have had a V8, its hard to tell.But there is no way that the 50 Ford could keep up with the hot rod. Completely unbelievable.I'm all for willing suspension of disbelief in a movie like this, but it sure started out badly. There is no reason to make the scene so clearly false",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1476,xyberduke,A disappointment,2,23 May 2008,"I had high expectations for an Indiana Jones series directed by Steven. I simply fell asleep midway through the show.The storyline lacked substance and depth. It was predictable like those budget TV movies.The special effects were non-existent.The casting was horrible. Less Harrison Ford, the rest made me think that only a handful went for the auditions. Can't remember a worst casting than this.In summary, I believe this is a movie Steven would like to forget and it has successfully kill off any chance of another sequel if that was indeed the plan.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

For those that gave this less than a 5 rating, what are you comparing it to? There was action, humor and some great special effects. Yea, most of it was not close to what could happen in reality but so were the first three films. I was concerned seeing Harrison Ford on Conan. He seemed old and brittle but it didn't show in this movie. And who doesn't like Shia LeBoeuf? His resume is strong to very strong. I suggest you sort out the reviews and only read the best ones.

1478,iamdyer,"Why, Lucas??? Why? Why...? ...Why??? Please! Tell me!!! Why???! Why?!!! WHY???!!!!",1,24 May 2008,"There was a trailer beforehand of Kung Fu Panda somethingorother. The film then started with the Paramount mountain, formed from a gopher mound, and an unrealistic CG gopher poking it's head out of the mound. I actually didn't realise this was the film, and still thought I was watching a Disney trailer. This was my first sign that the film was going to be a filing cabinet full of soiled underwear.This complete cowpat of a film is truly a sign of the shifting zeitgeist of what is expected from cinema. At least from Lucas et al.There was so much wrong with this film, I don't even know where to start. Every scene was a howler. Story has now been replaced by technical ability with CGI. Character development is now abandoned in favour of a panicked attention-grabbing frenzy of disconnected scenes. Comedy comes from prat-falling CG chipmunks, rather than wit or a character's reaction to a situation (remember the German bad guy and Indy's reaction to the Arab on the windshield of the truck in 'Raiders'? Hilarious!). The bloated chase scene was incomprehensibly ludicrous. Fantastical CGI renderings paved the way for unrealistic feats of human acrobatics that would not have been out of place in the Matrix Reloaded car chase.Think of the scenes in Raiders where people are actually talking to each other for extended periods: Belloq and Indy in the Marrakesh bar; Indy and Sallah looking at the headpiece in the old man's house; Indy and Marcus talking about the ark with the CIA guys in his University. These are all great scenes. Classic scenes. They divide the action and drama nicely. They set the stage and peg the narrative so you know - without being patronised - what is going on. I didn't have a clue what was happening in Crystal Skull, and just as I was getting my bearings - an alien spaceship took off!!! I whispered to the guy next to me 'Please... make it stop.'.I really thought that Lucas would have learned a very sore lesson from the reaction to the re-hashed Star Wars movies. We don't want Midichlorians. We don't want CGI. We don't want prat-falling comedy robots and gophers. We want soul, scene, story, character, mis en scene, tension, performance, dialogue, good casting, solid character relationships.You will not get this from 'Crystal'.Which scene scared you more: Marion hanging 15 meters off the ground from the statue of Anubis in Raiders, or Marion driving (giggling) off a cliff into a tree (with no guarantee that she wasn't going snap the branches or miss the tree altogether) only to be let down gently into the water by the flexing tree, still giggling?This film has stretched tension and drama into the ludicrous and that's exactly what it ends up being. Ludicrous.When you come out of the cinema screen, turn around and look at the expressions of the people walking out behind you. I did, and it was a collective 'Has someone just farted?'High Points: Denholm Elliot's breathtaking performance.Low Points: Everything else.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1479,ddott,Waste of time and money,3,24 May 2008,"I am sorry but this has to rank as one of the worst films I have ever seen. To call it a far fetched, CGI overloaded, alien conspiracy film would be an understatement.For the first 30 mins, it was uncomfortably humorous but by the last third it was down right idiotic (there are FAR too many stupid scenes to list here).The mix in genres (adventure, comedy, science fiction, romance) so cloud the plot that by the end of the film you are trying to make sense of the film you just watched.Harrison Ford is no longer the swash buckling adventure hero but an old professor quite literally dragged back into the action. His young friend (wink wink) is irritating at best and pathetic at worst.How anyone can give this film anything over 5 stars is beyond me.If you like confused plots, unrealistic action sequences, poor character development then this is the film for you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1481,hysteria71,History Channel show/preview was better,3,25 May 2008,While it wasn't totally bad I snuck in to see Iron man after and that was much better! IJ4 should have been made 10 years ago. I have no problem with Harrison Ford but there were sooo many unbelievable stunts that seemed quite unnecessary. The plot was OK and I love the crystal skull storyline but to have them coming from dead aliens is a littler hard to swallow given the fact that they are all different and not functioning skulls. I felt there was way too much to overlook as far as believability goes. After IJ3 with Sean Connery this just didn't live up to the previous installments. The chases seemed to long as did the fight scenes. You think Indy at a later age would rely on his brain more then his brawn. It was almost hard to watch Karen Allen who looked much older then she probably is. If you do choose to still see it on the big screen don't expect much and plan on sneaking in to another movie.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1482,nosleepidiot,Not even close to the original trilogy.,1,25 May 2008,"Spielberg tried too hard to make another Raiders of the Lost Ark, which condemned this movie.I had so many expectations for this movie---and I'm not the typical Indiana Jones fan who has watched the original trilogy 100 times---but I walked away from the movie disappointed.1) The Jokes were OK. Some of them were funny, but most of them felt like they were forced. This movie was witless when compared to the original trilogy.2) The action was OK, but it felt like it was copied from the original trilogy. The car chase scenes and the truck chase scenes were clearly borrowed from ""Raiders"". The scene of Indiana Jones jumping into a car/truck and taking over after punching the henchmen in it, was repeated 20 times. The Final car chase scene took too long and was almost boring.3) OK, so I know the the movie has some scifi/fantasy in it, but it was over the top this time, and left people thinking ""what the...."" 4) Romance in the movie was bad. Indiana Jones is no longer the womanizer.5) some of the scenes showed Indiana Jones walk away from situation were it would take a superman to walk away from the physical punishment.Overall I felt like they took some scenes from the ""Raiders"", and then some from ""Last Crusade"" put them together and made a new movie.I voted the movie a 1/10 so I can bring the score down. I guess too many fanboys have already voted 10. In reality the movie was a 5/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1483,numa-iconia,"Good, Better the second time.",8,25 May 2008,"Well after reading all the bad comments I have to admit that I also came out of the movie not knowing if I liked or not. I'ts obvious that like me, all this people are super fans of Indiana Jones. But I give you a piece of advise, now that you know the plot, hated some scenes or some characters and know what to expect go and see it a second time. It worked for me. After seeing it two times I still have some elements that really bothered me:1. Mac, Indiana Jones ""friend"" pointless, confusing, and not really a friend. Makes you nostalgic about Indy's really good friends like Marcus or Salah. 2. Alien Plot..not bad but not for an Indiana Jones Movie..when he said ""...El Dorado"" I almost jump!, Nazca lines...wow!, but no...El Dorado with no gold replaced with aliens. 3. Harrison Ford was still great as Indiana ..you forget about the age in the first half of the movie but Marion who looked super old remind us that this movie is years apart of the others.. 4. The wedding scene..I would have ended it with the mountain scene ..If Lucas wanted a closure (like in Star Wars) or a family scene, It was enough with the ""junior "" comment to Mutt at the end of that scene. 5. The Tarzan scene with Mutt and that monkey (??)The fist time I had more buts, like music..less original unlike in the other three movies..or some boring scenes like the one in the tent.The main villain was not so bad...It was funny seeing her like she was part of Indy's friends like in the scene of ""bring me a piece of paper..""I actually liked the little details remembering the other movies like the Arc in the box, the Marcus Brody statue, the ""you have to get out of the library""..comment(in the other movies Indiana says that 70% of archeology is made in the library)..The motorcycle sequence when Mutt smiles every time with satisfaction while Indiana makes a face, just like his dad to him in the Last Cruzade.I missed the Nazis as the bad guys.Indiana would have never survived that blast.Beside this I liked the movie. You are In the movie from start to finish and in some sequences I remembered my childhood, I wanted one more movie, I wanted to go home and watch the other three once again and that, I think, is more than enough.

1484,Double_Nought_Spy,Extremely disappointed,3,26 May 2008,"Being a huge fan of the original Indiana Jones films I went to see this film with huge expectations, sadly I left the cinema feeling extremely disappointed and let down. I really did try to enjoy this film but everything from start to end was just - well not Indiana Jones in the sense of the original three films. The film had no edge to it whatsoever, it seemed like I was watching a slapstick comedy which was littered with corny scenes which did not get many laughs from the audience. The original films did have elements of comedy but they were subtle and not overdone e.g Indy shooting the swordsman in Raiders. The dialogue between the characters was clunky and uncomfortable, I felt myself cringing on more than one occasion.The film tried too hard to make references back to the original films in an attempt to please the audiences from the 80's, this in my opinion backfired due to the poor quality of the script. I felt the story was weak and lacking many surprises although the one surprise that was in there could be predicted early in the film. The 'bad' guys in the film had no depth and were totally nonthreatening, I didn't feel concerned throughout the film that Indy etc. were in any danger nor did I care.On a positive note the action sequences in the film looked good but I had already seen a lot of these in the original three films without the silly comedy.As I stated earlier, I really wanted to enjoy this film but it just did not happen. It was not the poorest film I have ever seen but it was the most disappointed I have been when leaving the cinema, this was obviously due to my massively high expectations and being a huge fan of the original films.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I have to say i had big expectations, because with all the technology existent, a great movie could have been made. But it just isn't.

1486,Spielberg_101,"Cheesy At Times, But a Good Flick That Fits",7,27 May 2008,"The newest installment of the Indiana Jones Saga has received mixed reviews from everyone everywhere across the country, and it usually follows the trend of either ""Brilliant!!"" or ""What in the world was Spielberg thinking?!!!"" And yet both comments are not necessarily wrong or right concerning this film. The film is both, in my mind, a brilliant movie that entertains the moviegoer and yet has me, at times, asking myself, ""What were they thinking?"" This question came to mind in a few sequences, namely the sequence in which a handsome greaser version of Shia LaBeouf is seen swinging through vines with some primate buddies in the cheesiest rendition of a Tarzan sequence I have seen yet in film. Honestly, what was that? The world may never know.The film, however, does entertain the audience and is definitely a fine film. The beauty of the scene in which Shia's character is revealed to be Indy and Marion's son is unsurpassed in it's hilarity. It is perfectly timed and classic. From then on the whole family drama that ensues, which is a favorite card to pull by Spielberg, is supremely satisfying. Whoever thought the devil may care Indy would be caught amongst family drama? It's pure fun, and it works.Some have concluded that the whole plot line surrounding aliens made the film completely ridiculous and a complete stranger to the original Indies. Not necessarily. The viewer must look at both the time period and the use in which the aliens fit into the plot and the myth surrounding them. First off, Indy is in the fifties, 1957 to be exact, and the hype of the world was focused on one question, ""Are we alone?"" How fitting to send Indy off on an adventure to answer this question in 1957. In comparison to the other Indy films, this is not as far off as people think. In the original films Dr. Jones was always finding himself adventuring after a symbol of deity. The Lost Ark, the Shankara Stones, and the Holy Grail were all godly artifacts. Same with the Crystal Skull. The tribe represented in the movies worshiped these as if they were gods. It all fits in the big scheme of things.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is definitely not the best Indiana Jones flick out there. It has it's cheesy moments and outlandish situations that leave us asking ""Why?"" However, it is a wonderfully woven tale that fits with the prior films and has us (or should I say me?) begging for a sequel.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1487,dkneib,"""Indy"" has run it's course...",4,28 May 2008,"Where ""Raiders"" and ""Grail"" were crisply written with a much better cast of good & bad guys, this episode left me flat. Forget about Ford's age...he did just fine...but his supporting cast was mediocre and unmemorable. No Denholm Elliott (understandably). No Sean Connery. No John Rhys-Davies. The only connection to past episodes was a resurrected Karen Allen with a relatively minor role. And the plot was...uh..well, let's just say that not even a pack of wild, swinging monkeys could save it! On a positive note, while Ford's acting and the special effects were fine, the best thing about it was that it wasn't ""Temple of Doom""! It's position at #4 in the series is still safe & secure!

1488,randykbh,Overrated,7,7 June 2008,"This overrated movie was not what I expected. First off, it's a Disney film. Why didn't they try keeping it as a PG movie, as are just about all other Disney films? It is rated PG-13, and rightfully so. But, they've got advertising aiming at kids. My wife and I went to Downtown Disney, and in the Lego store, they had a slew of Lego stuff pertaining to this movie. Aiming at very young kids. And this movie had foul language and a very gross man-eating ant scene that could make the very young kids that saw this movie waking up in the middle of the night screaming from nightmares. Second, space aliens? Oh my gosh. If I wanted to see a movie with aliens in it, I'd prefer movies like Star Wars. The previews I saw gave no indications to me that this was that kind of film.However, on a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 7. It did have some good things to it. One, it made me and my wife laugh. Two, they didn't go overboard with snakes. There was only one, in fact. And three, we enjoyed seeing Jim Broadbent (the school dean) in it. He's the guy who played Professor Kirke in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which happens to be my favorite movie. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull didn't come close to being a better movie. When it comes to the best Indiana Jones movie, that honor goes to The Last Crusade. We have that one on video. But, when it comes to this film, even though I gave it a 7, it won't be added to our DVD collection.Heard so much hype about this movie, and yet, I know of a number of people who were disappointed with it. It could have been worse. We could have paid full price on it. Instead, we were fortunate. We went during the bargain matinée.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1489,atiquealahi,not your best SPIELBERG!!!!!!!!!,2,31 May 2008,"Well i was really looking forward to watching this film. The other Indiana Jones film were incredible but i must say this was tantalising at times but overall a huge let down. TO think it hit record BOX OFFICE hits since pirates of the Caribbean.Spielberg i no you made E.T and yes it was a hit and 'no' Indiana Jones is not a sci fi marvel. you cannot mix the both. The film should of been called 'Indiana Jones and the kingdom of extra terrestrials'.Spielberg i usually love all your films but come on man the props that were used in the film were terrible. So unrealistic, what was the budget a fiver.What can i say about Harrison Ford. He was too old for the part. CUM ON slap on some hair colour, take a leaf out of Stallone's 'Rocky' or even 'Rambo'.To sum up, if you are looking for a classic to be murdered you have to watch 'INDIANA JONES'",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Harrison Ford is fantastic as Indiana Jones. a legend in the film industry. Shia labeouf lovely as always and brill acting. Karen Allen brill again. Cate Blanchett, the accent is really good. Jim Broadbent a little part but still good. Surprised to see that the character Marcus Brody was dead.

1491,pmcqueen1,A massive insult to the viewers,1,3 June 2008,"I've never seen a movie so full of MASSIVE inconsistencies. The magnetism that comes and goes. The refrigerator that survives a nuclear blast. The ants that do or don't eat people. The IMMACULATELY clean uniform of Blanchett. The corny over-the-top introduction of Indy's son. ""Mutt"" Williams? What was Indy's name?... Indiana. Who was he named after?.. The dog. BOOO!! Then there was the fact that the Russians were always behind them with NO explanation as to how they got through these perils with NO ropes, no help, and more. And, how about the ridiculous ending where the Fedora flies off the rack to land at ""Mutt's"" feet? Corny. It was HORRIBLE. If you can think at all, you will leave this film thinking: ""WTH?"". Terrible. Lucas has, once again, shown us why he caught lightning in bottle with Star Wars, and never again recaptured it. I never thought I'd see a movie in this series that was worse than Temple of Doom, but I did. Thank god I saw a matinée.truly a bad movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1492,Johnnybethewalrus,Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the could have been!,5,27 April 2010,"It was absolutely great to see Indiana again. It was always going to be an incredibly difficult undertaking to bring the aged character back, and please the fans, and Spielberg and Lucas predictably fell short. However I don't think the film deserved the harsh and overly critical reviews it received. Essentially the film has several very strong elements in the story and visual department. For a film set in the fifties, communism and aliens were a perfect direction to take in order to break away from the religious aspects done three times before. Communism was a huge threat for Americans in the fifties, and aliens were a huge subject that were commonly used in film as a way of expressing the anxiety surrounding communism. For me the alien based story was the breath of fresh air needed to re-launch the Indy movies. On the negative aspects, the film had some bad dialogue at points. Ford is a seasoned and capable actor, but even he seemed to be struggling with some of the clearly over the top and out of place lines. Some of these lines are so bad, that I wonder did Lucas write them himself, and insist they be put in. Bad dialogue similar to this appear at points in all the Star Wars prequels. The major let down in the movie were the action scenes. Indiana Jones was always full of actions scenes that were over the top, but at the same time seemed to contain vague plausibility. In this film they just became outright impossible, and as a result made skeptics of the viewers rather than exciting them.The jungle sword fighting and vine swinging is outright ridiculous. Blanchett was not a bad villain, but not necessarily a good one either. She seemed a bit too stereotypical. Obviously it could be argued that the villains in the previous films were very typical villains, but Blanchett could have had more 'character' in her character, so to speak. John Hurt's character wasn't particularly strong either, as was Ray Winston's. On the other hand Shia LaBeouf certainly didn't let himself down, and proved to be quite good in the film, perhaps reminiscent of the young Indy seen in the opening of The Last Crusade. Despite being a strong actor, he couldn't make this film great on his own. Essentially Spielberg and Lucas touched on all the elements needed to make this film of the year, and give it a place among the other Indy films. Yet they still managed to somehow mess it up through some idiotic scenes and dialogue that were not essential to the story, but somehow made it into the movie. The jungle sword fighting/swinging/chase/monkey marathon scene really really was bad. Even the waterfall wasn't as bad as the jungle chase. It wouldn't have made it into a Police Academy movie, and so has no place in a Indy movie. Im not a professional writer/movie maker, but scenes like the jungle chase make me think I could be. Obviously the standards can't be that high if that scene made the cut. Essentially the movie has its good aspects, some of which are very very good. But also its bad aspects, some of which are worse than riding a bicycle without a seat. These bad scenes cancel out a lot of the good. However I think the film contains enough Indy excitement to make it watchable. The is worthy of better than the savage reviews it received, and should be watched by Indy fans. I think people should have lowered their expectations when going to see the movie, because it was always going to be a near impossible undertaking to satisfy the matured Indy fans, while still being loyal to the previous films. I would give this movie 7 out of 10. That is a generous 7, some may say too generous, but the film has worthy aspects that deserve recognition. Worst scene, there are plenty to choose, but i'll stick with the jungle chase. Favourite scene, probably the fight between the greasers and the jocks in the diner. I thought that was hilarious and fitted nicely into the film. I hope that Indiana Jones 5 will be a vast improvement, but know better than to expect something amazing. George Lucas will live forever so we can expect fifty more Indian Jones movies, a hundred more Star Wars movies, and probably Physical Graffiti 3. But lets hope that instead he simply puts his name on one or two more Indy movies, and makes them exceptional rather then making a whole bunch of half assed money makers.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1493,fer-v,do they even know geography????,1,4 June 2008,"This is the worst film i have seen so far this year!! I was born in Peru, and I can tell you the Nazca lines are nowhere near Cuzco as they showed in the movie. Also, what's with the Mexican music?? Again they were not in Mexico, they were in Peru!!!!! Throughout the whole movie they kept on talking about Maya culture, and you could see Mayan pyramids. AGAIN WRONG!!!! Mayas are from Mexico. Incas are from Peru. I personally think this is almost an insult, they are showing to the whole world things that are not even true!!! It seems as they didn't even look up the right information and just threw whatever they thought was ""right"" into this movie. I'm surprised at how everyone seems to believe that every South American country is the same as Mexico!!!

1494,SuicidalSkydiver,Let-down of a movie.,6,9 June 2008,"I was frankly disappointed with how much Indy and Lucas sold out with this film. It was enjoyable to watch, but i really was disappointed with the key plot part of Aliens. As soon as it clicked what was in the box in 'Area 51' i groaned out loud. Why did they have to move so far away from what Indy used to be? The idea of aliens is just so out of place for Indy. It always used to be the ancient supernatural powers and legends, not this poor attempt at innovation. They should have stuck to the old Indy guns.Next thing, we're going to be seeing Nazis and tomb raiders in Star Wars",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1495,anwyyn,Indy comes through again!,10,16 June 2008,"I'll confess up-front that I wasn't expecting as much from this film as its three prequels. Harrison Ford is twenty years older, see, and I just couldn't imagine an Indy movie under those circumstances. But he did it, Indy did it, and the movie was an absolute wide-eyed riot! The action outdid itself in all its glory, all the humor of the chase scenes were fantastic, and overall Indy IV is one awesome come-back for Indy and Marion! See it ... you won't be disappointed. *I* wasn't, not in the least! :)On the other hand, I saw this film with my sister and her husband (we're all 50-ish). My sister's opinion and rating would likely be a shrug of the shoulders. Her husband wasn't in the least impressed. Silly people! ;)I've been an Indy action and humor fan from the beginning ... maybe that's a must to enjoy this movie?

1496,cjacobs1983,A New Appreciation,6,17 October 2008,"Upon first seeing the latest installment of the Indiana Jones series, I, like most everyone that I have later encountered, was very upset and disappointed. I went into the theater with all of the fond memories and respect that I had for the previous movies. Everything was going well and as intended until the ending. As I conversed with my friends at, what we considered at the time, the Epic FAIL of the movie, we discussed what titles would have been more appropriate. Indiana Jones VS Predator, Indiana Jones: Meets E.T., Indiana Jones VS Aliens. I groaned and grumbled as the day is long.When the movie came out on DVD I knew that I was going to buy it. In much of the same manner that I wound up buying the Star Wars Episode I-III. I needed to have the complete set. I bought the Delux 2 Disk set and while I watched the extra Features I came to appreciate the movie a whole lot more. Steven Spielberg mentioned that the first three were made to be like the Action Serials that he saw as a child. Since the movie is set in the 50's, the equivalent would be a B Rated Sci-Fi kind of picture. After he said that, I immediately saw and knew what he was talking about and came to a deeper understanding to what the movie is and how in a sense it is almost a parody/throwback/homage to those kinds of movies.When you go back and re-watch the original trilogy, they are campy, bad dialog, and over-the-top action that would never happen in real life. But we still love them to death. That's because we have grown up with them and they are as much a part of our lives as E.T, James Bond, and Mickey Mouse. We have put a rose colored filter on them and take them as more of a sentimental movie than what they really are. If you watch Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with that in mind, then you will not be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

But then, suddenly, when they meet each other and decide to kill each other their is no tree in the way, now they can drive at 100 km/t and stand on their cars, jumping from one car to the other without Any trouble! (probably because the trees decided that they didn't wanted to be in the way Any more and just moved away...)

The characters could have been fleshed out more, they were dull and uninteresting. During the movie I really couldn't have cared less if Indiana got the skull or the Russians. I mean, what exactly were the Russians planning on doing with the Crystal Skull (which is, for some reason, highly magnetic...even to non-magnetic metals.) Indiana only cracks his whip once and never gets into and gunfights (is this the same Indy?) And I am sure I am not the only one who was confused and irritated by Ray Winstone's character.

1504,capn_cobra,Stands For Everything I Expect From An Indiana Jones Film,10,7 January 2009,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade are indisputably my favourite movies of all time (Raiders holding the gold medal). And, shocker of shockers, I thoroughly enjoyed this new installment in the series!But gotta say, I wasn't at all surprised about the trashing this movie was given. The people who hate this movie can be broken down into three categories. 1) People who simply didn't enjoy it as a film (which is perfectly reasonable, no film is for everybody), 2) People whose expectations of how it 'had' to be were so high they could never possibly be satisfied, and 3) People who had made up their minds to hate it before even seeing it.Let me tell you what I went into this movie expecting: adventure, comedy-laced over-the- top action, exotic locations, ancient legends, hunting for treasure, greedy villains, chases, creepy critters, and plain old fun. Armed with these expectations and nothing else I had a great time - each one of them was satisfied to the full. Yes, the execution was different, but the essentials were all there!The supernatural element was still strongly present - griping that it was aliens instead of magic seems to me rather like a kid throwing a fit because his mum put raspberry jelly on his toast instead of blackberry. The presence of VFX didn't bother me in the least - much as I love the old-school special effects of the originals, I'm still having trouble figuring out why the CGI is such a problem for some people.And as for the fridge. It was iffy, it was over-the-top, it was extraordinarily unlikely - but hey, isn't that just what Indiana Jones is all about? And come on, it's not so ridiculous that half the discussion board needs to be devoted to it. You stopped being funny after the first couple topics.In summary, a departure from the originals but still a thoroughly enjoyable film. If it has to be EXACTLY what you imagined and nothing different, you will be disappointed. If all you want is a good time, you have picked a winner.My humble opinion is yours for the taking.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1505,hASEROT,Have people forgot how to have fun?,6,1 July 2009,"Well the movie has been out for well over a year now, and I'm writing my first full review on it, after letting everything regarding the initial hype wash out, and i can watch the film objectively - without any need for expectation. And my final comment on it is, i really like it - is it as good as the first 3, no. But is it still a fun Indy adventure, without a doubt.The whole supernatural vs sci-fi debate, well, i can understand where people get mixed feelings about it - but it all fits within the context of the time in which these films were meant to have taken place. in the 30s and early 40s - it was well documented that Adolf Hitler was eager to find such artifacts as the Ark of the Covenant, The Holy Grail, and the Spear of Destiny - even rumored to have constructed a black altar in which the grail cup would sit, once it was in his possession - so naturally, these would be the artifacts in which Indiana would be in charge of recovering before the Nazi's could retrieve them. The late 40s brought the dawn of the Nuclear age, and global concern over the threat of a cataclysmic war between Russia and the United States, and McCarthyism all were abundant during the early 50s - and with the spring of new threats, coinciding with new technology, people turned to the stars, and more science fiction approach to their villains, instead of something tangible and real. - but lets not also forget that these Indiana Jones were made to replicate the fun, campy, and B quality serials during the 20s and 30s - and should be taken as such... and if i may, i will borrow a quote from James Rolfe (the angry video game nerd) on his review of the movie, that sums up my feelings as well...""... It was good, I enjoyed it. It's probably the most hyped franchise I can think of besides Star Wars, and it's been 19 years since the last Indiana Jones flick, so naturally there is a lot of high expectations - and I think that's the problem with this movie. If your expecting it to blow you away the same way the original 3 did back in the 80s, then your going to be disappointed. If your in the mood to be entertained, then you'll be entertained.... There is also complaints about the film being silly - and I'll agree, there were some gags that were pretty dumb. But overall it was nowhere near as ridiculous as Temple of Doom. I'm not saying it wasn't a good movie, the last half hour was amazing, but overall, it's way more goofy than Crystal Skull. You have to remember the Indiana Jones series is based off of the old adventure serials - it's a glorified B movie. Just a bunch of action scenes strung together with a historical backdrop. If you take it to seriously, then your missing the whole point.... There can never be another Indiana Jones flick that lives up to the original trilogy and everyone's expectations - so stop reaching for it, and like Indy's father says to him in Last Crusade, just 'Let it go'""i couldn't have said it better myself.I could go into a huge history lesson about how the historical significance of the Crystal Skull story, Mayan Culture, and the events surrounding the Roswell and the second UFO crash site on the western part of the state of New Mexico (which bares more similarities to the events that Indy describes than the Roswell incident) and the Mitchel Hedge's Skull - and it's lack of significance (even mentioned by Indy in the movie) - and how it's no more realistic or unrealistic than the Ark, Sankara Stones, or the Holy Grail - but I'll leave you the reader, with that to look up when your curious - It could've done without a few of the goofier moments - but i think it'll be better received by future generations than the current ones who had to live with 19 years of hype.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

You think they wouldn't of used it on the others if they had the technology back then?

Not so much in this film. Events that would ordinarily kill or seriously harm anyone are easily survived by Indy and his gang, most of the time without even the need to straighten their hair. Laughable. Imagine going down falls the size of Niagara - then doing it two more times, all in a small craft, and surviving each fall without a scratch and without losing the coveted 'skull'.

And it seems like the the action was too over the top. I thought Ford and Allen were decent, but it seems like that was the only thing that kept that movie going. I like a little bit of the old nostalgia but it seemed like at times thy were trying too hard. I also thought using that whole Area 51/Roswell plot line was a little cheesy. The second half of the movie was very predictable and very formulated. You knew the traitor was going to get his with his greed and Blanchat's character was going to meet her end the skull.

Before I go further I would like to state that I consider myself outside of these 2 groups, I like to remain neutral when it comes to define what is good and what is not (For me although we have some standards, it depends a lot on the point of view) I imitate myself to give an honest opinion rather than a judgment. I've been a fan of the Indy films since I can remember (I was born on 87), I even watched part of the ""Adventures of Young Indiana Jones"" series, and I have to say I love them all, simply because they keep me entertained and most of the time we get to see some got action sequences and some funny lines from the characters. The 4th Indy installment is definitely the weakest of all, although many may criticize the stunts performed on the film we have to accept that these series haven't been characterized for being 100% realistic, so to me, except for a particular stunt involving a NUCLEAR BLAST which crossed over my ""I can accept this"" line, it's cool. Then we have this Mutt Williams character which I didn't particularly like, but hey! Maybe we needed some fresh blood on the movie. The sometimes present sometimes not magnetism of the Chrystal Skull bugged me, but then I found it as an interesting choice for an Indy film's mythological artifact. And pretty much goes on like this, it has a bad aspect s balanced by some funny or cool detail , so I'll have to rate this as a mediocre film that was supported by some of us based on mere sentimentalism and nostalgia.

1511,CowboysGuy2824,Indiana Jones is back!,9,18 May 2008,"When it comes to reviewing a movie like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the hardest thing to do is to keep expectations intact and not expect a film that will blow Raiders of the Lost Ark out of the water. It has no chance to beat that expectation, and the film will ultimately become a failure with that mindset. You have to look at this film as another one of the sequels, which isn't a knock at the The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade; on the contrary, they're great films, but this is the caliber you should expect from the fourth installment of a film that hasn't seen a new addition to the franchise since 1989.With this in mind, does the fourth Indiana Jones film succeed? The answer? An incredibly enthusiastic yes! After 19 years away, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford have recaptured that magic that has made the Indy trilogy so successful and added a worthy sequel that stands right in line with the two sequels. The little Indy quirks are here: the Paramount logo fading into a mountain-like object in the background, Jones's insane phobia of snakes, the flight paths on the background maps, and the numerous references to the first three films. However, and give George Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp a ton of credit for this, the film is not simply a tribute to the first three films, but an intriguing, fresh story that is unlike any of the other three. This isn't Rocky Balboa where we have the same general story but given a new spin on it. While some fans will be upset about the departure from the familiar, biblical territory the first ones covered, I found it to be great to see a new, original Indy flick instead of a rehashed homage to themes previously seen.Spielberg seems to have found that pitch perfect balance between action, humor, and humanity that made Raiders so special. This isn't a flat out comedy like Last Crusade seemingly was, though there is still plenty of humorous moments in this film (surprisingly, very few jokes and gags actually fall flat). This isn't two hours of non-stop action, as the film does take its time to establish the plot, detail the archaeological quests, and let us remember why we fell in love with these characters in the first place. In fact, the scenes with Marion Ravenwood and Indy together are gold. Don't get me wrong; a lot of the action is a blast. The car chase scene in the jungle is a great piece of film-making, and the first scene with Mutt Williams and Indy leave a lasting impression. Great action doesn't have to come in newer, advanced looking CGI extravaganzas, as Spielberg proves that traditional action set pieces are still the most entertaining kind there is.Now, about the cast. The star is aging, the sidekick is from Even Stevens, Karen Allen hasn't been in a big movie in God knows how many years, and, for some reason, people were worried about Cate Blanchett in here role. Well, let me put the concerns to rest: the entire cast is established pitch-perfect chemistry and everybody plays their parts incredibly well. Harrison Ford is, for the first time in a decade, having the time of his life and it shows in his excellent return to the famed American icon. It's no secret that he has been campaigning for this movie for years, and it shows in his strong performance. Karen Allen shares fantastic chemistry with both Shia LaBeouf and Ford, as she provides a lot of the necessary charm to the second act of the film. Blanchett uses a heavily over-the-top Russian accent, but she finds just the right note between creepy and intriguing to make her the best Indy villain since Belloq in Raiders. Ray Winstone does well enough in his role, as does John Hurt and Jim Broadbent.The major surprise, however, is indeed Shia LaBeouf. For some strange reason, people actually thought this guy would be the Jar Jar Binks of the Indy series, and they couldn't be more wrong. Remember the outstanding chemistry between Sean Connery and Ford in The Last Crusade? The chemistry between LaBeouf and Ford rivals that. I've believe that he's been a very good actor for the past few years (and one of the few redeeming factors of Transformers). He does a great job in this film. The entire cast is good.A strong story and great performances don't imply that this film isn't flawless. It isn't, but the flaws are few-and-far between and didn't hinder my overall enjoyment of the film. The first 20 minutes are somewhat slow; it takes a little while to get to Marshall College. These first twenty minute aren't necessarily boring; it is still entertaining, but it could have used probably 5 minutes of edits and pacing corrections. This is my biggest problem with the film, and once Indy returns to Marshall College, the film really kicks off and turns into the roller coaster ride that everyone has been hoping for.So, as you can see, I dug the film. I may have even loved it (repeat viewings should ensure this). It is the Indy film that you've been waiting for since it was announced, and the creative trio have proved that, with the right care and intentions, you can bring an American icon back from the dead and still have him own the competition. Rip-offs like The DaVinci Code and the National Treasure series try to be like these films, but even the fourth installment of these wonderful franchise just towers over its impersonators. This film will go down as a very strong entry into the quartet and fall somewhere in the middle of the two sequels when all is said and done. The Indy film that you've been dreading? Not even close.Indiana Jones is back.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1512,craigtuttondrum,The Biggest Disappointment Ever,4,3 December 2009,"I'm giving this a 4 for 4 reasons:- 1.Harrison Ford is Still Indiana Jones 2.The introduction of Indy & the music arrangement coupling his fedora placement is superb. Also some points in the following scenes up to the 'Fridge' were also well done; like his swing from the crates & the appearance of the Ark. 3.The classic fist-fighting done by Indy (with accompanying theme) on the Jeeps (NOT the Sword-wielding crap or vine swinging). 4.The Aztecs - good idea including them but should have been much more in the film than that brief scene.On a whole, I was SO excited about seeing this film that I failed to realise the effects that todays society & audience would have upon it's awful script. Lucas needs to quit, Spielberg can do better.I think that the only redeeming features for any real Indy fan are the references to the classic Indy films & the nostalgia associated with the costumes, characters & above all else the music.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1513,bryan-ross-molinelli,Indy As He Should Never Be Seen,3,8 December 2009,"Indiana Jones is a character that is best left in the '80s, where he belongs. I knew going into this fourth installment of the franchise that disappointments would abound, but couldn't anticipate how many. About forty minutes into Crystal Skull, I became convinced that in future discussions about this character and his movies, I would tactfully act as though Spielberg and Lucas' creation was still a trilogy, and nothing more. That conviction still stands.To get where I'm coming from, you have to - pardon the pun - do a little digging with me here. Let's take thirty seconds to remember what made the first three films so great. Raiders was both a fresh take on pulp-fiction adventure and an homage to actual adventure serials of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Temple was a slightly dogged sophomore effort that, despite some mood issues, solidified Jones as being a very dangerous yet likable character - no easy feat for a middle-aged man who supposedly teaches academic archeology in dark, stuffy universities. Crusade rounded out Indy's world by providing a delightful insight into his origins, ""humanizing"" him without sacrificing pacing and thrills. The unifying thread in all three of these original films is Jones' ability to take ostensibly dull archaeological pursuits (the Ark of the Covenant, the mystical stones, and the Holy Grail) and turn them into romping adventures that manage to suspend just enough disbelief to make them suspenseful and fun.Crystal Skull departs from this formula almost immediately. After an eyeroll-inducing fade-in with the trademark Paramount logo turning into a computer-generated molehill (really?) we get into something that feels more like a James Bond intro - Cate Blanchett backed by a bunch of no-names with a big Russian spy thing going on, Jones their captive, and lots of guns. What ensues is mostly primer for what we can assume will be a fairly enjoyable film. Instead we get a not so plausible premise - Crystal Skulls as archaeological boons - and boring banter between Shia Labeouf and Ford. We're thrust into South America, where Marion Ravenwood of Raiders fame, now much older and anything but sexy, is foisted on us for no particular reason. She's no longer Indiana's goddamn partner, that's for sure. Just as Aston Martins are often retired from and then re-introduced into Bond movies to whet hardcore fans' appetites, the writers of Crystal seem to treat Karen Allen as nothing more than Indy fan catnip.A string of poorly-executed CGI-embellished scenes lead us, eventually, to a conclusion so contrived a third-grader could have written it. The ending strips away the human side of archeology and just leaves you watching something that is not only visually unbelievable, but intellectually dishonest as well - two crimes the original series never committed, despite plenty of opportunities to do so. Any connection to actual archeology or human history is forfeited in this film, and the audience is simply expected to embrace the unlikely because it has been packaged as an Indiana Jones vehicle.This fourth Indy flick is not entirely bad - the Yale scenes are enjoyable, and overall the movie does feel very 1950s. Ford manages to pull off his part despite his age, which is laudable. And there are elements of the archeology that sync with reality. Unfortunately everything is tied together in a sloppy, made-for-money manner that pales in the faces of the films that came before it. Sometimes Hollywood big shots should just live by the old credo - ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" This is a movie that, while a big box office success, should have stayed buried to never see the light of day.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1514,green_blooded_hobgoblin,"Not atrocious, just a little disappointing",4,14 January 2011,"I arrived late to the franchise of Indiana Jones, but while growing up the characters and adventures inspired by them were a staple of playground games at school, and Henry 'Indiana' Jones Jr was the hero every kid wanted to play. So while I can't say I was there at the very beginning, I have grown up with the movies playing a part of my life even into adulthood. Which is why, upon seeing the fourth offering of a franchise which film-wise had ended in 1989, I had misgivings.It has its flaws. And some of them do seriously put a dampener on an otherwise enjoyable film. The lack of a solid plot jars and you do find yourself just taking it blindly in after a while rather than having to deal with the headache you'll get if you try and think about it too clearly. But having seen other things with far more convoluted plots, it really wasn't the biggest problem. Nor was the over-reliance on CGI or the recycled action sequences or even the inclusion of aliens (because c'mon Last Crusade had a 500-year old Knight and the Holy Grail. It's fair to allow Spielberg and Lucas some leeway when including such a 'modern-day' leap).For me personally, it was the characters that let the film down, and their complete lack of development. OK, we know Indiana Jones already; he's our protagonist, we understand his origins, motivation, etc. But he's been absent for nineteen years. There is a small scene with Jim Broadbent (who's appearance is welcomed but short) when some attempt is made to address the passage of time (the deaths of Marcus Brody and Jones Snr) but it feels thrown in and forced, leaving fans wondering exactly what Indy's been doing with himself for all these years; CIA missions being brought up once and never returned to, and how he feels about not being the young sprightly Indy we remember. John Hurt, much as I admire his work, also adds little to the movie. He plays 'Ox', the finder of the eponymous 'Crystal Skull', who spends every moment of screen time until ten minutes before the end playing the deluded lunatic for little real reason, wasting both his acting talent and the audience's time.And Cate Blanchett as the villain Irina Spalko. While she commands the Ukrainian accent with only a few slip-ups, there is no point in the film where Indy seems in any real danger. This idea may just be tinted by a rose-tinted view of the originals; but Major Toht from 'Raiders'? Scary. Mola Ram?! Downright EVIL. Now - Irina Spalko? Meh.Also, what about Mutt? As a 'sidekick' we learn very little other than some family fillers which leads up to the 'big twist' that everyone saw coming, and the fact he has problems at school. And by the end, nothing is different. Personally I would have preferred more screen time devoted to the relationship between Indy and Mutt (especially after *SPOILERS* it turns out that Indy's his father). The fact seems casually accepted with no real conflicts apart from the initial reaction, and it would have been interesting to see the comparisons between the old age of doing things 'Indy' and Mutt's more cock-sure left-first-ask-questions-later approach; which is exactly what Indy was like at Mutt's age.As much as it is easy to pick fun at this movie however, it does have its charms. While not a strong addition to the franchise, it's possessed of some sound acting from Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf given the material they've got to work with. Mutt is admittedly one of the more stronger elements of the story, and his tie-ins with the 'greaser' movement helps to cement the film in the 1950's time period. And yes, while Shia does seem to blame himself for the movies failings (and with a scene to your name involving a Tarzan-esque swinging through the trees with CGI monkeys, it's not looking good), with the script he's given he manages to come across as a believable rebellious young man who hasn't quite found his place in the world yet.There are enjoyable moments in the movie, (the barfight with the 'jock's and greasers and Indy on the motorcyle) and some painful ones (last twenty minutes with the random Mayans trying to kill the heroes, then the aliens ""from the space between spaces"") but overall it isn't awful. It's worth at least a watch once.If only to see Harrison Ford don once again the Fedora and bull-whip.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It wasn't anything like the others and if you want to make a sequel it should be similar. I couldn't believe they stooped so low. The aliens were ridiculous all of it was terrible except Harrison he was the same old Indy. Indy having a son really ruined things and I really wanted to see some light saber action to make this film better. Maybe a scene with Jaws in it would've made it better something just something needs to happen so people don't waste their time on this movie.

1516,fishbeef,"Any other franchises you want to destroy, Mr. Lucas?",2,27 May 2008,"Let's take a little trip back to about ten years ago when Star Wars Ep. I: The Phantom Menace was released. Many of us sat through the film, forcing a grin on our faces while trying very hard to like the plot, the acting, etc. Deep down, though, we knew it was terrible. Episode II came out and was somehow even worse than the first. By the time #3 was released, most of us had given up but we still went to the theaters, if not to see cinematic gold then to at least get some Mystery Science Theater 3000-style enjoyment out of the big, wooden, emotionless mess up on screen.Now we've got the new Indiana Jones movie, and knowing that George Lucas had major involvement in the film, including coming up with the story, I was more than a little nervous. However, I had faith in Spielberg that he could overcome even the worst plot (hell, he even made Temple of Doom, which was written by the people who wrote HOWARD THE DUCK, at least enjoyable if not fantastic) and work with Harrison Ford to make another decent Indy film. I was so very, very wrong.Where shall we start? Let's skip all of the absolutely ridiculous plot points for now (atomic bombs? Aliens? Reynold's Wrap-filled plastic skulls?) and the horrendous acting by EVERYBODY, because those have been commented on ad nauseum by many other reviewers. For me, the most destructive thing about this film was that, at its core, there was absolutely no emotion. None. Just like in the Star Wars prequels, it was completely impossible to care about anybody on screen because they were as one-dimensional as you can possibly get. Remember in the old Indy films, when somebody would be injured or get in trouble, and you actually felt a pang of concern for them? Most notably in Last Crusade, when Sean Connery gets shot near the end of the film, you WANT Indy to find that damned holy grail so he can save his father! This film had absolutely no heart at its center; every single frame of film felt static, like they were just going through the motions. Part of the fault for this was the extremely dumb script. No jokes worked. Lines that were meant to be serious just came off as cornball (""the space between spaces?"" Are you kidding me???). There is Indy fan-fiction on the internet that is fifty times more interesting than the script used for this film.And, what happened to Spielberg? It was like watching a first-time director! Scenes were poorly framed, badly lit, and completely uninteresting. Spielberg is usually good at making even the most formulaic story seem fresh and interesting. He can make a scene that should be obvious feel like it came out of nowhere. That was not the case here. Part of the problem was the sudden superhuman qualities of Indy. Being launched at 100 mph in a refrigerator after an atomic blast and walking away without a scratch? Falling down three Niagara-sized waterfalls in a boat and not falling out? Indiana always got by on his cleverness and a little bit of luck, not by being Superman. Once you realized that Indy CAN NEVER DIE, what's to be concerned about? This is only the tip of the iceberg that sank the once powerful Titanic of Indiana Jones. Sufficed to say that Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas should ALL retire from film-making. Don't even TRY to force Shia LeBouf on us as the heir to Indy. We're done. We've had more than enough.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I've had a complete reversal in my thought process.Initial thought process.. All bad reviews weren't written by Indy fans. They're critics that just don't ""get"" the franchise. Positive reviewers are the true fans.Current thought process. Exact inverse of the former.If you combined every negative element people have touched on in all the reviews on this site and on the net, it would only begin to describe what's wrong with this movie. There are so many intangibles that you just either get or you do not.This is the closest I can come to describing how this movie makes me feel. And it actually pains me to think there's a billionth of a percent chance that George Spielberg could read this and think this is simply based on laughable things such as ""fondness of a series"" rather than anything ""based in reality"". I actually love everything Indy related that came out between the time of Raiders and up until the most recent Indy video game. All of it. The Disneyland ride. The MGM stunt show.

Fans of Raiders that tolerate Last Crusade do. I am a fan of the franchise.

This wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it is not terrible either like a lot of people say it is. These are the people that say every movie is bad and don't understand why they are not using old techniques to shoot graphics and stunts. Of course they are going to use green screen and cgi now. Times have changed and the technology today is so much better than it was back then and this allow movies directors to make their movies whatever is it they want them to be. Why would George Lucas and Steven S. use the same technology they did on the older Indiana Jones movies? That would be insane!This movie was GREAT! Great story, great actors, and great plot. The plot about Aliens and the crystal skulls is a true story not that we have found the kingdom (yet) but the story behind this movie is true and has been studied for a very long time. The action sequences was fantastic and I was shocked that Harrison Ford gave such a good performance compared to some of his later movies. I love Harrison but as people get older they loose some stuff like energy but it looks like Harrison has been saving it for this movie because his performance was great in this movie.This is like comparing the old Star Wars to the new ones. Of course they don't have that classic film and never done before kind of background to them but the with new technology and how far the film industry has come despite the new movies of classic films such as Indiana Jones and Star Wars are still great movies and the people that write bad reviews are just afraid of change. I have friends like this who just say every movies is bad just because they can. Don't listen to these people, go out and see this movie for yourself! Make up your own mind!

1519,musicallover6,Indiana... Let it go. Just... let it go?,5,25 May 2008,"In the famous words of Henry Jones Sr. , I believe this movie sums up what he was possibly saying to Indiana 45 minutes through this film.I honestly don't think that the direction, the actors, or the settings screwed this movie. This movie could have had CGI in it as much as it did, and I still would have enjoyed it.The thing I want to talk about is the script. The script is why I give this movie 5 stars. The story is hokey, the dialog is hokey... the end is hokey. It has ""family"" written all over it. Indiana has gone from historical fantasy, to ... campy one-liners and laughs for family.I can't how annoyed I was by how many times Indiana said ""kid"" or ""friend"" , ""pal"", ""comrade"", ... the list can go on. Did anyone actually proof-read this thing? It was so amateur that it made me cry.There was no character development whatsoever. It was too rushed, leaving me with questions. Mainly on Oxley. His character drove me insane.That leaves me with the artifact to this film. With the story they chose, the artifact (Crystal Skull), and the ending... it was just too... un-realistic to me. Yet, you will have those that differ that the Knight in Last Crusade was hokey, and the Art of the Covenant was hokey in Raiders. I don't know, they had something about inner-strength and belief. ... Finding out aliens exist doesn't really give me any inner comfort or belief.All in all, the script is what is really left to blame. The first 45 minutes felt like an Indy movie. But as many say, once he entered that jungle, and met up with Marion... that's where it went downhill.I grew up with the Indy films. Unlike many fans, I'm not outright bashing ANY actors, directors, or CGI for that matter. I think the script was just horrible.

Some of the situations deviated entirely from the plausible: it's nice to know that we can jump in our fridge should we encounter a nuclear blast.The good: Harrison Ford proved that charisma doesn't fade with age and it was a treat to watch him put on the fedora and swing the bullwhip once more. Shia LaBeouf and Allen were clearly uninspired, but who can blame them when they had such a weak script? Which by the way, was brought to you by the guy who once wrote, ""you're the one who's out gobby, out of your mind!""The CGI with the aliens was so obvious that I almost forgot this was Indiana Jones and not a Pixar flick. But what I find most pathetic is that Lucas, Spielberg and Koepp had nearly twenty years to think of an ending and they simply recycled one that they already used twice in the series (mystical force kills villains, saves Indy).And it wasn't even a good ending to begin with.

1521,LongPantsTramp,Spielberg on autopilot,4,27 May 2008,"It's not that the fourth Indiana Jones movie doesn't have all the necessary ingredients for a successful sequel to one of the most worshiped trilogies out there. There is non-stop humor and adventure (although everything feels embarrassingly calculated), sure, and the whole UFO and Red Scare aspects of the film are intriguing and rather fitting for its 1950s setting.What's lacking, though, is any sense of heart or wonder that infested every frame of the previous films. Entering a 4000 year old secret temple has rarely been this dull. It would even be easy to forgive the 21st Century digital effects (CGI monkeys?!) that have no place in a genre where things are supposed to feel worn rather than synthetic, if it wasn't for a tired director trying to visualize an appallingly repetitive script (How many times did the Holy Grail or the Sankara stones have to be explained? Once, and then we got on with the damn story!). As sad as it is, this is Spielberg at his laziest, directing on autopilot ('The Lost World', anyone?). How is it possible that the master of set-pieces hasn't been able to create even a single memorable action sequence? Just think about the truck chase in 'Raiders' in comparison to the weird Tarzan vine-swinging in a blue-screen jungle and you'll understand.Cate Blanchett and Shia LeBeouf did a surprisingly good job with their hammy characters, but on the more important hand, Karen Allen and most notably Harrison Ford himself seemed really uncomfortable reprising their most famous roles. Any chemistry between the characters? Dream on.It's a virtually impossible task to try to analyze what makes a film magical, funny or suspenseful, and what prevents it from achieving any of the three. Perhaps they tried too hard to please every Indy fan on the planet or perhaps they didn't give a damn about quality, but the fact remains that 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' marks the death of a franchise as well as, symbolically, the death of summer blockbusters on the whole (rather convenient, considering that it was Lucas and Spielberg who gave birth to the whole blockbuster idea in the first place).However, instead of running around like a crazed fan-boy and blaming Lucas for raping my childhood, I am more determined to blame the modern film-goers who, in the spoiled little Michael Bay-oriented brains of theirs, mistakenly think that bigger is always better.

1522,Slainmonkey,All great trilogies don't come in 4's,1,11 December 2008,"While I was a very big fan of the first three films (yes even Temple of Doom), I didn't go into this film with high expectations as I've seen the declining quality of the films that both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have made of late. Also when I film series hits it's 4th installment it's rarely ever good. However Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is possibly one of the worst film sequels ever made, which is a statement I don't say lightly.Unlike other installments this particular film feels more geared to children, reason for this is that it's so mind numbingly stupid that it's literally condescending to the audience. While all other the other film in the series may have had some rather absurd moments they kept it all in the realm of being able to suspend disbelief, Crystal Skull however does not, the action scenes are just plain stupid and take you out of the film rather then draw you in. The most infamous scenes for this are the Nuke Fridge and Mutt vine swing....though there are plenty of others that are almost as guilty.This film also lacks the strong character element which the previous films would draw all their charm. Indiana Jones and Marion are nothing more then shadows of their former selves, lucking any of the dynamic they had in the first movie. Mutt Williams played by Shia LaBeouf who plays probably the least convincing 50's greaser in cinema history, who they try to attempt a humorous dynamic between him and Indy akin to Indy and his father in Last Crusade. However this comes over awkward and the humor falls flat in it's face. Kate Blanchett plays the ""so called"" evil Irina Spalko who would seem more at home terrorizing Rocky and Bullwinkle and last but certainly not least Professor Oxley which I could go on about all day....but I'll just say his probably one of the most annoying characters in film history.Above everything else the film was just poorly written, it's pace flows awkwardly, any time it ever touches on a good idea (such is being being investigated by the FBI for a potential connection with the Communist) that drop abruptly it before exploring it properly and the lousy often incoherent alien plot line which was not only poorly handled but out of character for the franchise. Then we have such unnecessary moments like the scene with poorly rendered CGI animals which come over more as embarrassing to watch then funny.To be fair there was one scene in the film which was actually good. A brief moment early on in the film where Indy and Mutt get chased around on a motorbike on the campus ground by the KGB and it's the only part in the film which make you feel like you are watching an Indiana Jones film. Sadly this scene doesn't last long and you are left having to endure the rest of this terrible film.While we all may like to see a sequel to some of our favourite films just to see our favourite characters back in action. However to be enjoyable the film needs to be good. Maybe they just got tried or waiting for Lucas to come up with an even halfway decent idea or maybe it was just a laps in judgment but this film was truly terrible and one of the worst sequels to any film ever made.

Consider this Spielberg's 'lost' Star Wars film, there are NUMEROUS indications the star wars myth is here, just look at Ray Winstone bare his flashlight like a light-saber. Watch the moment Dovchenko and Indy fall onto the glass circle, the rest of the scene is a star wars duel.2. To dig deeper, you have to really see how much fun they're having: a 'digging' creature emerges from the ground (archeologists dig), is run over by a flaming vehicle (humans destroy without knowing), with cheering white people (the audience), reflected in a mirror of a truck with hiding Soviet soldiers posing as US Army, a mirror bridges their connecting shot...I'll stop there.

I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan and this thing was the biggest piece of crap they could have possibly produced! It's like they all got together and said, how can we possibly ruin this series by making the worst film ever. If I could have, I would have demanded my money back. Just awful, purely awful, and that makes me incredibly sad. I waited through the entire credits hoping that I would see Harrison Ford come back on the screen and say, ""hey, we were just kidding, the real movie comes out later this summer!"". Seriously, if you are a fan, don't watch this film, it will ruing the entire series for you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1526,luceiiab,4th out of 4,4,29 May 2008,"Let me start out by saying that I've always been an Indy fan. Raiders was the first movie I ever saw (literally! Apparently it was so hot the summer it came out that my parents dragged the infant me to the theater roughly 6 times so we could sit in the AC) and a great love of the movies grew from there. I'm also a Spielberg and Lucas fan in general, but this film has me completely stymied. How can two people who've made something like half of the movies I've watched more than five times have made this? I wanted to like it; I really, truly did even though the trailers and what I knew about the plot made it look a little suspect. I went to the cinema tonight with a kind of cautious optimism. I hoped that my suspicions were unfounded and I would walk away with that wonderfully buoyant feeling you get after having just seen a really good film. Not the case I'm afraid to say. I and my companions came out more frustrated and disappointed than we had expected to be under the worst of circumstances.Let me say a few words about why: 1) the script was just atrocious. There was one, maybe two, scenes in the entire film that made sense from start to finish. Not to say that they were non-linear or terribly confusing, they just didn't seem to move the plot along and random things would happen that had absolutely no explanation either before or after (the random, masked, Peruvian martial arts experts) or they were just silly (the vines). The dialog wasn't stellar either. 2) the acting was about as good as could be expected, and Harrison Ford truly IS Indiana Jones, but poor John Hurt and Karen Allen. Hurt's character babbles unintelligibly through 90% of the film and Karen Allen has to play a woman that hardly resembles the beloved Marion of the first film. She does it credibly I suppose, and I think the fault lies more with the direction and script than with her. Cate Blanchett on the other hand had a pretty open slate to create her character on and this is what she gives us? It really is as ""Boris and Natasha"" as you've been told. I think she is a very fine actress indeed, but this performance was just disastrous. 3) The effects were almost laughable in places. I'd read so much about Spielberg saying they'd done it with a minimum of CGI and yet I saw a movie whose effects looked done completely on a computer, and not a very good one at that.On the upside, it's not two hours of my life that I want back. Yes the script was flimsy and the acting was so-so and I just couldn't get on board with the entire premise (why do I find it easier to accept that the Ark of the Covenant contains angels that melt a bunch of Nazis?) but there were certainly worse ways to have spent a Wed. evening.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1527,webb_sara,my comments on Indiana Jones 4: Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull,10,29 May 2008,"I have nothing but excellent things to say about Indiana Jones 4. Steven Spielberg has done it again!! I think Indiana Jones 4 is a wonderful movie that was well worth the wait. The acting was wonderful and Harrison Ford still has it in him to play Indiana Jones. Cate Blanchett was so convincing as the villainous Irina Spalko but it was Harrison Ford who carried the movie. It was also good to see Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood the role she made famous in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. There was action and adventure in every turn of the story and Shia LaBeouf was very convincing as Indy and Marion's son. Once again, it was well worth the wait.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1528,cbottomley,Should never have been made,2,23 May 2008,"How wrong could they have got this? Did Spielberg and Lucas lose track of what made the original a classic? Raiders had top notch action, stunts, humour. It ticked all the right boxes.This outing is way too much and way too far fetched. Ford is old and he needs to realise action films are for people that don't need a couple of hours of massage to move first. I thought he was going to spit out his false teeth at one point.The film seems to move in slow mo just to make it look like Ford is quick. The bike chase felt that they could've got off and run faster. This film is so bad even Shia doesn't pep it up. He tries to act and pulls it off every now and then. He comes across as though he was as bored as me.This is so bad don't even watch it when it goes to DVD. The end of this film is as laughable as Ford's performance.I kind of hope they make another with Shia as Indy just to try and redeem the embarrassment of this waste of 2 hours.DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1529,mpeg4v3,"Thank you once again Lucas, you just don't know when to quit destroying my childhood",5,22 May 2008,"I've never written a review here before. But for this movie, I need to.I can't understand our culture these days. Call it nostalgia, a yearning for better times, or what, but it seems every few months we get yet another continuation of a series of movies that have been gone for years. Star Wars, Die Hard, etc. It seems like we are obsessed with living in the past.No one seems to be more guilty of this than George Lucas. I just don't know what he was thinking when he came up with the premise for this movie and pushed it more and more.Now, I understand that this movie is supposed to be in a different era with an entirely different theme. The threat of communism, the sci-fi b-movies, the rebel without a cause feel. I also understand that mysticism and fantastical elements are a part of the Indiana Jones series, and I accept that. But they just went way, way too far this time.The entire premise of this movie just doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel like an Indiana Jones movie. It felt like someone instead was making a tribute movie to the Indiana Jones trilogy- which there wouldn't be anything wrong with, except for the fact this is supposed to be a continuation.Why I say the above: 1.) The science fiction elements were too much. I don't want to go into spoilers but the entire ending just felt far, far too unbelievable. Again, I know there is supposed to be a bit of the fantastic in these movies, but this was way, WAY too much. And that just made it not feel like an Indiana Jones movie at all, which is what mainly ruined it for me. If they had just kept it to a minimum, more in line with the first Raiders and Crusade where the sought after item was a relic of another time with powers no man should have, then sure it would have been treading over old ground again, but at least it would have actually felt more like an Indy movie than this.2.) CGI. I think there's just something about CGI that makes me instantly dislike it, because you can ALWAYS tell what's CGI and what isn't. This movie was touted as a return to the old school stunts of the first three with minimal CGI... which was just a flat out, utter lie. Even if the action stunts weren't CGI, all of the backdrops and what not were. It took me right out of the action. There was nothing old school about it. Even the creepy crawlers of this one didn't feel that scary because they were all CGI.3.) Unbelievability. Now, this has nothing to do with the science fiction; this is in regards to stuff like the wonderfully bad scene involving swinging from vines with the help of monkeys that everyone loves to mention. Not to mention a certain refrigerator scene at the beginning. The whole point of the series is realistic action and stunts, and there was nothing realistic about this.I place the blame for pretty much all of this on George Lucas. I went into this movie with very little expectations and somehow he managed to let even those down. You just know the only reason Spielberg and Ford agreed was because he wouldn't quit hounding them to make it. Way to go Lucas, rape my childhood some more.What's next, Back to the Future 4 with Marty battling aliens in a futuristic CGI Earth?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1530,malkovichmalkovich7,The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen.,1,10 December 2008,"I have heard it said that a movie has to be very, very bad to deserve a ""1"" on a 10-point scale. This deserved a ""1."" I think this was one of the easiest movies I've ever had to rate, and I'll tell you why: of all movies I have ever seen, I can think of very, very, very few, less than a tenth of one percent, that I would actually by much happier if I had never seen. If I had only seen the first Matrix film and remained unaware of the existence of others. Or if X3 had never been made. There are bad sequels, and then there are sequels that urinate on the legacy of the originals. This was one of the latter. I saw ""Manos, the Hands of Fate,"" and taking into account what it had to work with I appreciated it more than Indiana Jones IV. It was easily and by far the worst time I have ever had in a movie theater, ""bad dates"" included. It was basically bad at every moment, with the brief exception of the car chase through Yale. Essentially it was the worst movie ever, if you judge with intentions, ambition, budget, and personnel taken into account. Like, its no Ed Wood movie, but give Ed Wood the people in and behind this movie, and I bet he could have come up with something better. To imagine that they spent years holding the viewing public in suspense, rejecting script after script, until THIS one came along, well that just boggles the mind. Faith in critical reviews, which were positive across the board, is permanently shattered.I struggle to find the greatest benchmark of how bad this movie was, to this day. I actually have substantial debates on the subject, both internal and external. I was already having misgivings during the second scene; by the third my opinion was low, and from then on it was just a fading hope that something good or worth my time might happen. You be the judge: Script? ""Triple agent?"" Monkeys? Fridge? Mind Reading? Aliens? Cate Blanchett's character? Magnetic guides? Bulletproof Indy? Ripoff of the Mummy (itself an Indy ripoff)? ""Too bad about Dad and Marcus?"" I could go on and on. Any movie can be bad, but to be really bad, depends upon: 1) viewer's preparedness and determination to watch to the end, no matter what. Anything can be bad, and you can just turn it off. Unless... 2) viewers' expectations built up. How much? Check. 3) involvement of people you really like. 4) ambitions of the movie. As enumerated above. 5) level of failure. Worst Script Ever? Acting rarely believable? Silly graphics that make you wish computers had never been invented? Triple check.In a rather disjointed way, I think I have made a solid case for Indiana Jones IV being a movie, perhaps THE movie, that should not be seen. By anyone. Be warned that you may very well be a happier person for not having seen this movie, if you are so lucky.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Not at all like the Indiana Jones we grew up with.This felt like a big budget B-movie, with ridiculous and unbelievable action sequences and way over the top acting.Raiders was easily the best, but Temple of Doom and Last Crusade were even leaps and bounds better than this crap.The action in the first three movies were somewhat unbelievable at times, but it wasn't anything as unreal as Crystal Skulls. Some examples - Indy and his crew all go over three consecutive waterfalls (one giant one) yet all five of them are fine. Or that motorcycle chase..come on. Too many crazy stunts to point out. Or when Marion drives over the cliff right into the tree which bends them perfectly down into the river. That was a neat trick! Or how about when Shia Lebouf's character goes all Tarzan swinging on vines with his little monkey helpers and lands in the Russian Jeep. And what was with those ants from Jurassic Park? Also, how can I forget that Indy survived that nuclear bomb attack by stuffing himself in a fridge. Not only didn't he melt, but the bomb launched him three miles through the air, he landed and he was just fine. Ummm..okay sure. Let's go with it.And the acting, as I said, over the top. They were yelling when they should have just been talking. Like those scenes when Indy and Marion first see each other after all those years. It felt forced. It felt fake. It felt, again, like a B-movie. Cate Blanchete's Russian Femme Fatale character half reminded me of Doctor Evil. I was just waiting for her to stick her pinky on the corner of her lips and let out a five minute evil laugh. I think Spielberg and Lucas were so focused on making their theme park driven action sequences good, that they forgot to direct the actor's dialogue, or even write any good dialogue for their actors to say.Then there was that ending with the aliens. Aliens? It just didn't feel right for an Indy film. Just out of place. It wouldn't have surprised me if the alien started talking about how they told the Mayans that the world was going to end in 2012 when Planet X comes back. When that space ship started to take off, I thought maybe Indy would jump up in the space ship, punch out a few aliens and take over the controls so he can fly his new family around the galaxy. Harrison Ford could have revived his role of Hans Solo. I don't think George would have mind.I'm saddened by this attempt, given Lucas and Spielberg's talents. They had such an opportunity to do something great. Instead they fell flat. I laughed way too much during this movie at stuff that wasn't supposed to be funny.

Its been nearly 19 years since the Last Crusade and this film marks Harrison Ford's return to the title role. Harrison did a great reprising his role as Indiana Jones along with Karen Allen who returns Marion Ravenwood. While its good to see the return of Jones and Ravenwood, the film does not feature Marcus Brody because the actor who played him, Denholm Elliot, who passed away aw few years after the Last Crusade. Sallah does not appear in the film which is a little disappointing. The film does feature new characters such as George ''Mac'' McHale and Mutt Williams. These characters are a little annoying, especially Mutt Williams who is played by Shia LaBeouf. The plot has a good story but has some parts that are hard to believe such as the nuke fridge. Overall, it was good to see Harrison Ford return as Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1534,Luki_Dimension,Don't ask for the moon people,9,22 May 2008,"I'll be the first to admit that I was never a big fan of the Indiana Jones movies. I've only ever seen the 2nd one all the way through and never got round to watching the others despite wanting to. I'm glad I haven't though, because judging from other comments, it would have ruined this movie.The problem with bringing back old franchises is that people have immortalised them in their minds so any revival can never be seen as anything but awful. Star Wars, Knight Rider, Godzilla...need I go on? Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull does not have the greatest script, the greatest effects (the greatest loss to the movie world is this over-reliance on cgi over other effects), or perhaps the most believability (a refrigerator, waterfall surviving and Tarzan impressions to name a few), but despite this, it is great to watch. Its entertaining and keeps you interested despite its stupidity. It reminds me of movies from the earlier era's, before people cared so much about having 'realism' in movies.Do yourselves a favour - don't look at this expecting the next classic Indiana Jones movie that's just like the previous 3, and you will love it. The franchise has evolved - get OVER it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1535,ututman4,S for Satisfactory,7,9 June 2008,"As a fan of the Indiana Jones franchise, I was very much looking forward to this sequel. As a fan of the franchise, I was one of many to see it at a midnight release showing. As a fan of the franchise, I am glad to say that I was satisfied with the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.I give it a 7 out of 10. Light years behind Raiders, a continent behind the Crusades, and an Alaska ahead of the Temple of Doom.A lot of fans are disappointed in this new installment, and I can understand why. But what those folks need to understand is that while they have grown up, loving the original films as kids or young adults in the 80s, the franchise has stayed the same. Straight up, no holds barred, fun, over-the-top, adventure flick.Another thing people need to understand is that this film takes place in 50s America; the time of the Red Scare, nuclear war, Roswell, Area 51, and aliens in general. Those five elements are present in this film. That's WHY they are in there. They aren't in there just for no reason. There most certainly is a reason.Regardless, people tend to think aliens are far more far-fetched than the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant, which is odd. People should be willing to bet half their life savings that the chances of aliens existing are much higher than of things that grant eternal life or shoot lightning bolts at people and melt their faces.Everything shown in the film is in there for a reason. But I will say this.The entire flow of the film and the ending wasn't that good. Nonetheless, with those two asides, the film was exciting and refreshing and made you realize why you go to the movies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1536,figgy24-557-347720,"Not bad, not great.",6,17 November 2020,"Reading the other reviews I really don't understand why people have a problem with it being about aliens. Is it anymore unrealistic than an ark containing the power of God or a few rocks with lines on that allows a devil man to remove someone's heart without cutting their chest open or, that's right you guessed it, the search for a magic cup that grants eternal life but only if you want to live in a cave.This was an entertaining movie and a decent outing for Indi, no worse than The Temple of Doom, I'd say better. I would have scored it higher but it was slightly let down by poor CGI, slightly over the top action sequences and an underwhelming enemy.Don't be put off watching it by the morons giving it 1 out of 10, most TV movies don't even deserve that. Most people watching it will have watched the first 3 as kids, and when you're a kid films and TV shows seem great no matter how poor they are but when you watch them back as an adult nostalgia is quickly overcome with disappointment and this I think is what has happened with this installment of Indi. It's not a bad movie, just not as good as people remember Indi as a child but in reality it sits quite happily within the franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1537,PeteDead,"That's not fiction, That's Spielberg and Lucas calling you STUPID",1,30 May 2008,"It's true, to make a script like this, obviously producers see us as a big bunch of stupid morons. Indiana Jones was made of rolling stones, whip acts and maybe one or two ""c'mon"", supernatural scenes (ok, there's more, but you know what I mean), not making Indy a freaking roach. How the hell did he survived a nuclear explosion inside a fridge? I quote a friend who watched the movie with me: ""That just was the tip of the iceberg"", and that's true. The acting, the gophers, the cafeteria fight, the FBI (what the hell was the meaning of their appearance?), the Tijuana-like Nazca (why Hollywood thinks that every town crossing the Bravo River is just like Tijuana? I still don't get it), the monkey with the Fonzie hairdo (it was a Fonzie hairdo, right?) and the later swinging over the trees, the falls (ok, I'll give it a reasonable doubt) and the last 20 minutes of the movie. The list could be longer.Now, last years of cinema have made me wonder... Why is that Hollywood think we're stupid? Why using the same old clichés? Why making movies that explains everything that happens on screen, not letting the audience deduces for themselves what's going on? Or why making movies that are not explained at all, because the plot is crap and nothing really happens? Why trying to revive old sagas of successful movies with all this stuff? All I can think is they think we're stupid, boneheads, or just too lazy to think.I still wonder... Why they make us believe that Indy can survive a nuclear explosion?

There were a few in particular that are worth watching by themselves. The main trouble with the latest Indiana Jones movie is the script, which has many really badly written sequences and a plot that escapes believability. There are 2 scenes in particular where I didn't know exactly if I was watching Planet 9 from Outerspace or Tarzan. It is understandable but not accurate to compare the first 3 Indiana Jones films and say that the original had a few cheesy scenes and things that often escape believability too--this film really takes extra liberties in the area of far-fetched! To make matters worse, Karen Allen and Harrison Ford seemed to be going through the motions instead of bringing good character personality, although Ford did a better job.

1539,nl1025,Don't Buy The Hype - You'll Be Sorry,1,23 May 2008,"Nostalgia can only carry a horrible product so far. Eventually, any given thing is what it is, not what it was. And I can tell you all right now what Indiana Jones 4 is: a hammy, contrived, formulaic hack job full of liberal political undertones you've seen before.If you absolutely HAVE to see this film, do not read further. This review will still be here when you're ready to talk about it; and believe me, after you see this pile of **** you'll feel the need to get it off your chest as well. Now **** off, this is about to get ugly ***WARNING  Spoilers*** Still here? Great, lets do this.So the film begins with a 50's rock song and attempts to further immerse you in the time period with an incredibly gay highway race scene that sets the pace for the entire movie. While I believe the 50s' were a morally sturdier time, generally speaking, there's no excuse for the campy feeling Spielberg injected into it. Just because times were more conservative doesn't mean everyone was some kinda happy-go-lucky slapdick with a sharp haircut and a **** eating grin on their face, which is exactly what you get here. The movie never looks up.Shortly afterwards, the audience gets introduced to the bad guy: Irina Spalko played by Cate Blanchett. Its safe to say that I wouldn't even watch a porno with this stupid ***** in it after watching her ham it up for the better part of two hours. Watching her trying to pull that roll off was about as bad as I imagine Braveheart 2 would be if they tried to make a black guy play the struggling Scottish king. There HAD to be an actress from Eastern Europe who could've looked and sounded the part, Blanchett's performance was downright offensive. Think Kate Beckinsale in Van Helsing, complete with hilarious fake accent and bad body language; insults just don't do her turgid performance justice.Harrison Ford was great, as always. I can't blame him for the over-the-top lines he was forced to deliver because when he spoke, it was exactly like I remembered it. Not only is the man still good looking enough to play the lead role, but his fantastic voice hasn't changed a bit. It still holds every bit of the authority it did in the 80s', and for his part Harrison Ford definitely held up his end of the bargain. I was honestly shocked by the size and tone of the old man's arms, and would personally like to see him in more movies in the same way Sean Connery made the transition from young pretty boy to respectable elder. But enough fluff.The biggest noticeable difference between this movie and the previous three entries is the CGI. I used to be a huge fan of special effects, just like you, but this movie crossed a terrible threshold. It senselessly crammed CGI in where it wasn't needed in the form of unnecessary wildlife. The prairie dogs and monkeys immediately reminded me of the wolf in Day After Tomorrow. If you haven't seen DAT, I can honestly say you're a better person than me. Good for you. In that case you'll need another reference and it comes in the form of the Star Wars remakes which inexplicably infuse CGI into otherwise perfect sets. Same in Indiana Jones 4, it's horrible.But bad CGI and bad acting can be forgivable if the story is well written, which just wasn't the case here. The story is intolerably stupid and miserably formulaic. A ten year old could predict how each and every scene is going to end, there are no surprises or twists. The movie just goes from one corny sequence of unbelievable events to the next without bothering to build any tension or suspense. Combine that with the shameless political correctness and liberal undertones and you have a two hour long insult on your hands that you actually paid money to see. *buries face in hands* Think it can't get any worse? Think again, friend. Spielberg threatens the audience with a sequel in the form of Indy's son assuming his dad's role. That wouldn't be such a bad thing if the series was still as good as it was in the 80s'. Indeed, one of my Great Childhood Moments was watching some Hindu chump get lowered in the pit of lava while his beating heart caught fire in the hand of the evil shaman high priest in Temple of Doom. Indy 4 was completely devoid of any such marvelous moments. In fact I openly laughed out loud on several occasions that weren't intended to be funny, including the unveiling of that plastic piece of **** Crystal Skull that makes me chuckle just thinking about it.Look people, I saw this movie at the Alamo Draught House which serves beer while you watch, but even a nice buzz can't help this horrible attempt to cash in on us aging Indy fans. This film is awful, and I'm ashamed of myself for buying into the hype.

1540,visibledelight,"An insult to every Indy fan (and to everyone else, for that matter)",2,28 May 2008,"Rarely do I write reviews, but this time, I just couldn't help it.First of all, I have to say that I did not expect this movie to be anywhere close to the original trilogy; yes, times change and I was sure the magic of the previous Indys would surely not be recreated in any shape or form.That said, the first 5 MINUTES of this abomination were a slap in the face of every movie goer: the first damn thing you see in Crystal Skull is a CGI gopher - so much for using fake looking crap only where it's 'necessary' (is it really ever?) and so much for Spielberg's promises not to over-use such effects. The whole damn movie is a goddamn CGI effect, and trust me: it looks absolutely and unquestionably artificial and unbelievable! Just as I like the old Star Wars movies and their 'realistic' look much better than the jumping around in front of interchangeable blue screens in the new ones, I have to say that especially the gopher, the monkeys, most of the jungle scenes and the UFO at the end look so dramatically out of place that you cannot help but to get completely torn out of the movie experience and your Indy tomb raider archeology rocks mood.Now for the characters:Indy: Great, especially for his age. Mutt: Well, nothing ground-breaking, but OK in general. Good sidekick. Mutt's mother: Plain horrible - during the whole movie, all she does is smiling and grinning like she's on drugs - even when she's driving a damn car into a canyon! I'd have a good laugh, too! Oxley: If you ask me, the whole 'he's gone crazy' thing did not fit in and gets on your nerves faster than you can say 'Lucas sucks'. The Russian villain (I don't even know what her name was anymore): Never anywhere close to being a real threat. And her death - the most boring thing ever. That guy who's supposed to be Indy's friend, then a traitor, then a friend again just before becoming a traitor again: ...Plot holes, inconsistencies, ridiculous scenes and so on: Oh my god, I don't even know where to begin... Let's make a top five: 5.) Mutt plays Tarzan to catch up with a car race just to bring his newly made made monkey friends with him - of course to jump right into a car and knock out an evil Russian. 4.) Our heroes fall down a waterfall of gigantic measures in a car/boat not once, not twice, but three times - not a scratch. 3.) Mutt's mother drives a car down a canyon, knowing that she would land on a tree that gently bends and thus puts them safely on the ground. 2.) There's a nuclear test facility right next to a warehouse in which god knows which treasures are stored? 1.) Indy's survives a nuclear explosion by hiding in a fridge that gets blown away some hundred yards and then gets out of it completely unscathed - WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?I could go on and on, my main question is this: after almost 20 years, how could they have messed up so badly?

1541,marcin14,Successful Destruction of Indiana Jones Series,1,29 July 2008,"This movie is incredibly painful to watch. It has so many factual errors, boring lines, plain dumb and irritating action and bad acting that watching it is superbly uneasy and the only retreat might be simply falling asleep at the movies (I did). Above all, however, is the criminally idiotic script/story line that will definitely make the older fans of Indiana Jones wonder, ""Sometimes it might be OK to have a desire to destroy somebody's older work but why with such a viscousness this time?"" I completely understand previous comment authors pain from trying to write something about this movie to make the comment long enough for posting--there is simply nothing to write rather than summing up in one simple sentence, ""Dumb beyond disgust.""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1542,lexsilvertouch,Watch it on its own terms,7,23 May 2008,"There has been much negative response to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I think that generally there are two main reasons for this. One is rooted in the film, the other is rooted in the reviewers.The first problem is CGI. There is too much of it. I have no problem with its usage, but I take issue with gratuitous use. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but there are a couple of animals which show up in the film, one near the very beginning and another couple during jungle scenes, which are badly created and which are distracting because they are so un-Indiana Jonesish.The other problem is that people are unwilling to watch this film on its own terms. They just want to go in and watch Raiders of the Lost Ark. Well, my only response is that Raiders of the Lost Ark has been made. It's been done. This is not a 30's adventure serial in the vein of the past films. It is a 50s sci-fi serial, and the switch in genre is absolute. Try to make this film fit into a Raiders-shaped hole will not work. It is simply a different shape of film.That is not to say it is worse. It is not a worse film because it is a different genre, it is a mildly worse film because of a couple of slightly poor decisions on the part of the filmmakers. But even so, it is a good film and but for a few moments, particularly a few moments which could have done with a little more ambiguity towards the end, wholly enjoyable.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

That's all Indy was and that was what was so innocent and fun about it. We all know its fake, it doesn't NEED to look real. We don't NEED cgi aliens to cover the lousy story. (aliens imported from war of the worlds, stephen is consistent!), we NEED a good story, with a goal that we want indy to reach. That was also strange about this movie; indy couldn't give a damn about the skulls, just like the audience.summary; just a little door, push it, and it opens, secret halway, some bugs, couple of bad guys, whip, witty remarks, voila, no more, no less!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1545,CaptainBlastem123,Total abominable trash,1,24 May 2008,"To even think that this movie is anymore than trash compared to the other 3 Indiana Jones movies, is ridiculous. This movie is simply horrible. Here are 3 main examples as to why this movie does not belong with the other Indiana Jones movies: First, the use of CG. CG in any Indiana Jones movie is just completely out of place. The first 3 movies have a special charm to them. That being no cheap computer effects. They actually went to the desert to film a scene in the desert. They actually flew planes and drove prop vehicles off of cliffs. THAT is movie making. CG simply cheapens the quality of any movie. You can ALWAYS tell when something is generated on the computer. So why use it unless you simply have to? Secondly, the story. The first 3 movies followed a theme that was consistent mainly in the first and third movie. We had Nazis, and we had artifacts that came out of the Bible. (Ark of the Covenant, Holy Grail). These lost artifacts where at the end of a long and adventurous chase between Indy and the German army....Now that was an awesome theme! Instead what we have in the new movie, are Russians, and...Aliens? ALIENS? How did we go from Indiana Jones and the German army looking for lost biblical artifacts, to space aliens?? It's on the brink of comedy. I seriously cannot believe that they did this.Thirdly, they waited far too long to make this movie. A 19 year stretch to make a 4th movie promotes a gap that is far too wide. Why 19 years? The answer is simple. Right now we are in the midst of yet another stupid Hollywood craze. It's the season to make sequels to movies that don't need sequels. Die Hard 4 is a good example.All in all, its a badly written movie that has nothing to do with the other three. It's only purpose is to follow the current Hollywood fad. Which seems to be making comic book movies, and sequels to movies that really don't need them.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1546,smitastic,Time for a positive review,10,25 May 2008,"I don't know why all of these people are posting one negative review after the other. It seems no one on here has a positive review, I on the other hand do. I thought the movie was great and delivered in true Indy style. A lot people are saying this movie is not believable and far-fetched, yeah like the other ones weren't. Free falling in a raft out of an airplane, a man guarding cups for 700 years and a 3 ton boulder perfectly rolling down a tunnel after you, sorry folks but these are also far-fetched. This movie has all the familiar Indy traits with some new twists thrown in, it's a great movie. Most of the people leaving these negative reviews, would have said it sucked no matter what. It makes me wonder if they really even saw the movie in the first place.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1547,mreddie07,Terrible,1,23 May 2008,"I really love the work of Spielberg and his movies of my childhood: ET, Raiders, Back to Future, Jaws, etc are all incredible. I had such high hopes for this film having loved all three in the trilogy but this was a stinker. The first 35mins had promise but it dropped its charm fairly early and then seemed in such a rush to the end. In fact it dropped all dialogue by about the last 20mins and tried to keep impressing with overly fake CGI work. What made Crusade, Doom and Raiders special were the back stories behind the action, the story here wasn't up to scratch and didn't give the talented cast much to work with. Many of the final scenes drew groans from the theatre audience, if only Spielberg had gone with Darabont's script. Wait for the DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1548,conferenssi,Indy as I remember it !!,7,27 May 2008,"Now people will obviously complain about the unrealistic action scenes, the much spoken twist in the plot and possibly about the comic esquire villains as well.I personally enjoyed this flick a lot! It brought back memories from my childhood, when I was behind Indy all the way and just enjoyed the ride without analyzing the content too much.This is exactly what Spielberg provides. He gives you USA from the 50's with all the possible stereotypes. The well paced action scenes contain quite a bit of humor and, if you can just leave your adult cynicism behind when you enter the cinema, you will find yourself laughing hysterically from time to time! I'm not going to go into specifics with the plot but just remember that it most certainly is not more far fetched than in the first three movies.Cate Blanchett and Harrison Ford were excellent. Actually I have nothing bad to say about the cast.In the end, you just have to switch to another mental state if you are all grown up.

1549,tim-john-mead,Why would I give this 10?,10,20 August 2014,"I guess being some 19 years odd in the waiting, if not the making, this was a movie bound to be a let down. Yet somehow, despite this - and being a fourth movie(!) in a series - it wasn't. Yes, some of the acting was sketchy... and perhaps (for better or for worse) played with sheer joy of revisiting a role rather than a tight grip on a character (I'm thinking Karen Allen here). But you know what, her performance worked. All the performances worked. Some were better than others... but the characters worked. The adventure and escapism - despite some all-but-lifted ideas now and then - worked. The mere fact someone could make such naive escapism work *at all* for an... ahem... now much older audience, is remarkable in itself.So yes, the CGI in this movie, and many others, is probably motivated by the industry machine and keeping down of costs... and not look... I'd imagine. And yes, the frequency of use and choices made for CGI bugged me - but you know what, I got over that too. This movie was long overdue, totally ridiculous and thoroughly entertaining.

1550,tub_master_flex,my first walk-out in years,1,20 June 2008,"This movie now proudly holds the title of ""my first walk out in years"". I didn't think the movie could get worse after the first half hour, but I was wrong. The dialogue was boring, the plot was weak and misleading, the acting lacked enthusiasm, the actors themselves looked out of place, editing was overly noticeable, stunts easily predictable...etc, etc. Harrison Ford seemed stifled by his surroundings instead of smooth and comfortable like the old Indys. Shia Leboeuf was surprisingly the most enthusiastic and believable of the bunch. He wasn't playing the same innocent/insecure persona he usually plays in his previous movies which definitely left me with a better opinion of the man's acting ability. But regardless the writing and the story was so weak, his part seemed odd and not in agreement with the rest of the meandering storyline. Furthermore, some of the main elements used in the story are just plain weird and not typical of the original epic Indys- aliens and atomic bombs were some of the last things you would expect to see in the traditional Indiana Jones story. Nevertheless they were indeed there. I understand that the point of these elements is to emphasize the fact that Indiana Jones is older and living in a new era with new technology and new ideas. But that was dwelled upon so much that the effects this Indy ""renaissance"" had on the older characters' development was utterly ignored.This movie bored me. It's seemingly disrespectful attitude to the previous movies of the series was too much for to bear in the one hour I sat in the theater.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1551,bryan_jr2001,"The Phantom Menace of the franchise, but better than people say",7,29 September 2008,"I kept finding every reason known to mankind to keep from seeing this movie, but finally had an opportunity last night at the dollar theater and I'm glad I finally took the time to see it. This is the first time I've seen an Indy film in the theater, and honestly I don't think it will be the last.The first thing that got under my skin was that the first 10 minutes of the movie are kinda strange. It's almost as if Spielberg shot the first scenes first. The reason I say this is because when Indiana first speaks and has dialog, it doesn't sound like Indiana. He sounds different. The first time we see him amble along and interact physically with the cast, it's NOT Indiana. It's Harrison Ford trying to find the character within him that he hasn't played in almost twenty years.However, after the first initial scenes he starts getting into the old familiar groove, which brought a smile to my face.Shia LaBeouf does a pretty good job fitting in and for the most part I think he will do excellent in future movies, IF there are future movies.The overall storyline is very good in my opinion. Yes, it is a little rushed in most places. One thing that is missing in my opinion is the influx of computer generated special effects. This is a trend that I felt really hurt the franchise. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg should not resort to these things as often as they did. The one thing I always liked about these movies were the realistic chase scenes, other than the mine cart scene in Temple of Doom.This movie did have some effects in the main chase sequence that takes place in Peru. That, to me, was fake. It didn't look like they were actually driving on the side of a cliff and having a real chase scene, nonetheless, it still passes.It was also good to see Karen Allen back again. You can really see the old Indiana come to life when she enters the picture. I liked that a lot.I did not like Cate Blanchett's character, although I think her acting is superb in ever movie she makes. But her character in this didn't quite live up to the hype that previous villains have.Overall, I enjoyed the film. I don't want to be too critical because it was a decent effort. I think if they make two more movies, like they did with Star Wars to complete the six-part series, then this movie will go down as The Phantom Menace of the franchise.Favorite scenes: The river sequence is classic Indy material, the first meeting of Shia and Indy, and glimpses of the Ark and Connery.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1552,rkid_supernova87,Not for hardcore Indy fans,3,24 July 2019,"I followed the production of this film religiously, every press release was awaited with giddy anticipation. Steven Spielberg saying how he's making this for the fans, using very little CGI had me so giddy.....how unbelievably disappointed I was. Not even sure where to begin to be honest. If I was a young lad of 10 years old watching this before any other Indy film then yes, I'm sure I would of thoroughly enjoyed it. But being a hardcore fan of the original trilogy I just can't.
Positives; Harrison Ford is great. He looks great and does what he does as always. Legend. There's a few decent scenes (use the term decent lightly). I don't mind the Area 51 opening sequence when we are introduced to Indy and his subsequent escape. I rather enjoy the nuke town sequence (minus the silly prairie dogs and fridge scene). I like the tomb scenes also.
Negatives; I cannot forgive the acting skills of the rest of the main cast. Ray Winstone is usually good in his films. Not this. Kate Blanchett....just awful in this. Rubbish character and ridiculous accent. Shia Labouf....I usually don't mind him, but his character is his downfall in this and that's down to the writers. Karen Allen is not too bad in this although her character is not a touch on how strongly she came through in Raiders....again, the writers fault.
The story line is just ridiculous. Terrible macguffin this time around. Too far fetched....yes I know technically the Ark, Sankara stones and holy grail are far fetched in reality, but crystal skulls are just too far. Especially the story behind them in this film. Aliens in Indiana Jones = just no. No thanks.
The whole film is filled with awful CGI. I don't mind CGI in films such as the Marvel universe and films that must rely on it as there's no other way around it. But come on. Why do you need this much CGI in an Indy film that's meant to be like an old classic B movie adventure film? The ants, the nuke, the UFO, the prairie dogs, the monkeys, the whole car scene in the jungle....I could go on. I'm actually too angry to speak about it. End of.
Basically this film is made for kids who have never seen and Indiana Jones film before and have no interest in the previous 3 films. The last crusade is my favourite film of all time. How can the same people who made that (more or less) make this and try to sell it to us as a film for the fans!? I'm flummoxed.
Anyway, try to enjoy it for what it is. Not an Indy film per-say but a loosely based remake with the same lead character. I really wanted to like this, I still do....I try to re-watch it at times but it doesn't get any better and it's not a grower. Such a shame. Hope my children like it one day though.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1553,kid606,A crushing disappointment,4,25 May 2008,"Star Wars, Superman, Die Hard, Rocky, Rambo, Doctor Who... recent years have seen several TV and film franchises suddenly revived after a decade or more away, of which Indiana Jones and The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is the latest. What has marked them out is that though they have varied considerably in quality most have shown a surprising ability to recapture perfectly the 'feel' of earlier efforts. And for Indy IV - with Spielberg, Lucas, Ford and Karen Allen all on board - it seemed like this would be the case too.But it isn't. The first thing to say about Crystal Skull is that with it's espionage-based plot and abundant sci-fi elements the story just doesn't feel like something from an Indiana Jones movie. In past movies the 'mcguffin' which gets the plot moving has been simple - Indy has to find the Ark, Indy has to find the stones, Indy has to find the Grail. Here, Indy has to take a skull somewhere because it's something to do with some conquistador who may or may not have found El Dorado which may or may not be a civilisation based on alien technology. And yet, despite having by far the most complex backstory of any Indy movie, it feels like the smallest of them all. After a couple of action sequences set in the USA virtually the whole of the rest of the movie takes place in a perculiarly unconvincing jungle setting with none of the globe-hopping of previous entries. The plot is the most basic 'capture and escape' affair, with the pattern being repeated ad nauseum.One thing that has always stood out in the Indy series is the quality of the supporting cast, but here - despite some big names - it just doesn't gel. Cate Blanchett's character comes across as little more than a female amalgamation of Belloq and Donovan, and meets a similar fate to those two. Ray Winston does what he can with a character who - despite ample screen time - really doesn't go anywhere or do anything besides keep switching sides whenever the plot needs nudging along a bit. John Hurt is reduced to sitting in the back of a jeep mumbling, essentially acting as the human equivalent of the Grail diary or the headpiece from the Staff of Ra. Shia LaBeouf's Mutt is effectively a junior Indy but without any of the charm or charisma - and thus rendered useless as since the last movie we've had a TV series which presented a young Indiana Jones who DID have those qualities. Only Karen Allen - returning as Marion - comes out of the whole affair well. There's certainly no-one who stands out as being as entertaining as Sallah, Marcus, Short-Round or Henry Jones Sr.What of Harrison Ford himself? He does his best but he looks and acts his age. From our first glimpse of Indy it's clear that this is now an old man, and it's an impression that never quite leaves us as Ford is nowhere near as physical in the role as he was before, leaving many of the biggest action sequences to LaBeouf. An attempt is made to make up for this by introducing some very OTT slapstick, but this again jars with our expectations of the series. Certainly physical comedy has always had a part to play in Indy movies but not to anything like this extent.Overall it's a passably entertaining romp but right from the off it just fails to recapture the feel of the old movies. It's more like a Roger Moore-era Bond movie - fun and silly but not doing much to enhance the dignity of it's slightly more serious forebears.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1554,Mr_Leizar,Same old Indy... New Adventure. What more could you want?,7,22 May 2008,"So, I just got back from seein' Indy 4... and I have to say, its not nearly as bad as alotta people make it out to be... I liked it. And I'm a HUGE fan of the original films, especially Raiders of the Lost Ark, which stands as one of the greatest movies of all time, in my opinion. Is it better than the previous films? No. It's not better nor is it even on par with the original trilogy, but it does fit quite nicely into the series... Even with Shia Lebouf (who i actually sorta liked in this movie, much to my surprise), and the loads of CG effects, it just feels like another great Indy adventure. I was worried it would lack that certain Indy feel, in the way the new Star Wars movies lacked that old school Star Wars charm. But it didn't. It was actually quite decent. Not spectacular. But decent. There is one scene that really brought the movie down for me personally... One ridiculous, horrible abomination of a scene... And, I'm sure anyone who's seen the movie knows exactly what I'm getting at... Shia swinging through the vines like Tarzan with a pack of terribly cartoonish CG monkeys. I had to shake my head with embarrasament during that part... >_< I wish they would have just left that scene out, 'cause it wasn't necessary at all... it served no purpose what-so-ever, other than to add goofiness to an otherwise awesome action/chase scene. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???!Another thing that was somewhat of a weak point for me was the main villains. The Russians. They just didn't feel very menacing or much of a real threat when compared to the Nazi's in Raiders and The Last Crusade.Overall, Indy 4 was an enjoyable movie. If you go into the movie NOT expecting the second coming of Christ, but rather a good adventure with a sci-fi twist with everyones favorite badass Archaeologist, you just might like it.

Thankfully he didn't so much as even want to hold hands, let alone kiss like the idiot teens we were so clichély do. I also think it was boring enough to let everyone have their minds wander and have realizations like I did. I sure know the guy I was with did, he's gay now too.

I was kinda afraid that, after the sh!tload of bad reviews (including some completely absurd ones) it had, I would realize that I suffered from the ""Phantom Menace syndrome"" when I saw it in theater - meaning that I would like it a lot less on second viewing... And after watching it last night, I can say that to some extend I was right. Oh, I still like it and want to see it again, but I was struck by some problems it has that I completely ignored the first time I watched it (like the very odd lighting in some scenes, or the rather forgettable John Williams score - I can't believe I just associated John Williams with forgettable, but it's true!). And then there's the things I already found cringe-worthy then, like Karen Allen's bad performance, the monkeys scene or the totally unnecessary (spoiler ahead) CGI alien close-up at the end... (end spoiler)But in spite of all that, I still like it. It's a very fun thrill-ride, not to be taken too seriously, a thousand times better than the Mummy movies (to which many people compared it for some reason). Harrison Ford is brilliant, and Shia is great fun to watch. Great chemistry between them.In other words it's flawed and kind of a mess, but it's an enjoyable one.

I kept expecting Joel and the robots to show up at the bottom of the screen and scream some ""Mitchell"" quotes at the characters.The best explanation I can give for this movie, is that I honestly felt for the first 2/3 of the movie, that I was watching Indiana Jones...play Indiana Jones.I thought that after discovering the arc, that Indiana Jones had gained some notoriety, and was starring in a bad 1950's pulp movie. However, the fake film never ended...and the hackneyed lines kept coming, and the horrible story kept rolling...and the out of shape actors did the same.If you'd like to watch Fonzie jump the shark for 2 hours, and you are really starved for something to do...then watch Indiana Jones' new movie!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1558,obannon987,Still Got The Goods,8,21 May 2008,"Let me just say that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is absolutely fantastic. It definitely was worth the wait. Its light enough that non-Indy fans will be able to enjoy, and yet is still ingrained in the previous films that those who do know the films will smile at the passing references made. ...he's just as macho as he was as in the previous films...anyway ""its not the age its the mileage. The chase scenes and fight scenes are great as is the ""gross-out animal moment"". I would however argue that Ray Winstone's character was not very necessary except in being Indy's old buddy from between 1938 and 1957 (The years between the Last Crusade and Crystal Skull). There were also a few lines of the dialogue in the beginning that I just felt weren't completely in his character...But the film definitely keeps some of the ""conventions"" of the Indy films, while still showing some maturity and growth of the characters, that influences their actions to be all the more logical and wise. Certainly this is true on the part of Indy. The thing to remember when watching it is that its meant to be a fun film. You don't watch Indiana Jones expecting a thought provoking look into the wonderful world of archeology. You come wanting to see swashbuckling adventure, imaginative situations, fun and interesting character relationships, and overall a film about a seemingly average college professor and his journeys across the globe for various artifacts. Thats really why I love Indiana Jones so much. You have to remember-he is a normal guy.

1560,FaLLeN_AnGeL189,Back to Basics,7,23 May 2008,"This fourth installment of the Indy franchise was a roller-coaster of fun and mixed emotions.I very much enjoyed the movie. They stood by their mission statement of not giving into the CGI pressure of today's film making but still delivered a great film. Just goes to show you can still make great films the old fashioned way.Ford, even 19 years on from The Last Crusade only needed to step into Indy's shoes and once more to became the character the world fell in love with all those years ago. Spot on.Shia LaBeouf proves again why he's Hollywood's 'IT' boy and shines as Mutt Williams. He helps drive the storyline and adds much to the humour and banter between himself and Indy, which is reminiscent of The Last Crusade. (Alarm bells for me) Our Cate, although a fantastic actress in her own right left me slightly 'meh' about her performance of Russian agent Irina Spalko. Her accent seemed (to me, though I am NO Russian, so I may be wrong, but IMHO) to jump from Russian to Australian whenever she'd say Indy's name. I think because of the level of anticipation I had for her was so high that she simply fell short. But good job.The action sequences were mind-blowing. They had 'Spielberg' stamped all over them. One of my favourites was the car chase through the Amazon and the motocylce chase. Very action packed and full of laughs, well done.Overall I felt the story lacked compared to the original Indy films in terms of mythology (by that I mean I'm not familiar with it and was left slightly confused, kind of thing you may need to see more than once to fully grasp) as well as the plot twists- namely Mac.In the end I found the movie a great thrill ride and is definitely one to watch for this year.Em",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This movie was clearly made to entertain the fan base just before Mr. Ford went into retirement. Sure it doesn't compare to the originals, but if you can accept that its great entertainment. I liked how they touched on certain topics from the late 40's to 50's, made it seem like the time and place.

What's worse is they are cgi.But this pales in comparison to the scene where digital monkey's help out one of the characters after he's swung through the trees with them. Lies are being told about this film having a minimum of cgi. The film is absolutely loaded with it.Some people are in a severe state of denial about this entry in the series, but in their hearts they know it's a massive letdown. I wanted it to be great but i knew it couldn't be as film-making has been severely damaged by lazy cgi and political correctness. That's why Indy doesn't use a gun in this one, and if you blink you'll think he doesn't even carry one. The soviets have guns but it's like the A-team where no one is hurt by them.The edge has long gone as Lucas & Spielberg play it completely safe. Digital ants are not scary. The blood and thunder action is replaced by cartoonish set-pieces that are mostly laughable, like the sword fighting scene that makes you hang your head in dismay.Harrison Ford is still good but is saddled with too many people on his adventures. Overall i blame Lucas, the guy needs to stop stamping his vomit inducing cuteness on everything he touches. This is Indy for Christ's sake, it needed balls!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1563,jmglez,Forgettable,6,28 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not a bad movie, but it is a forgettable one.It seems many people is happy with this because there is action and Indy is in it. Good for them, but I expected something more.There are plenty action flicks around, some are good, some are bad and some are just correct. The difference between them is not the lack of action, chasing scenes or use of CGI. The difference is the story and the characters. In this movie, the story is not interesting (and a little lame sometimes) and the characters seem to move from one scene to another just because the script says so. They don't react with astonishment when the situation requires so, or fear (heroes have fear, they are heroes because they can overcome it) in frighten situations, etc. I'm not saying the acting is bad, I think it is a problem of the script.Indy is OK, Ford seems to do his best with the story, but there is no much one can do with it. My favorite scene of the movie (it is a transition one and it doesn't deserve a spoiler warning) occurs in a bar, with LeBouf and Ford sitting at a table. Both characters show how tough they are (and in this case, for once, Indy wins), and no action is needed for that.In addition, the amount of ridiculous CGI scenes and unbelievable stunts don't help to improve the experience.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1564,iain_inkster-1,Discordant effort,6,15 September 2008,"I'm not sure what kind of taste this movie was made to satisfy. Certainly not whatever tastes enjoyed the first three movies. It was like listening to someone play a familiar tune on the piano whilst getting every single chord wrong.Some people reflect on this movie saying ""well, at least it was better than Temple of Doom"".This point of view baffles me.Surely the mere existence of the bridge scene in Temple, sets Temple in a different league from Indy4, in terms of overall quality and fun or whatnot. That example alone should explain my confusion at the ""better-than-temple"" remark.What's even more baffling is that people who liked this movie accuse those who didn't like it of being insatiable. ""This movie was fun!"" they say. ""You guys just don't know how to enjoy yourself"". Sometimes they accuse dislikers of nitpicking. What??? Was the nuke scene a ""nit""?To comment, good or bad, on such a major scene can never, ever be described as ""nit-picking"". That's why I have this theory: most people who go out of their way to defend this movie actually loathed it, but they can't bear to admit to themselves the dreadful truth, that an Indy movie has been ballsed-up dramatically. So they come up with irrational accusations, such as that nuke-critics are ""nitpicking"".If the projector breaks down, and you don't enjoy yourself, is that your fault? Because, like a broken projector, I felt this movie go wrong, in spite of my will to enjoy it. This movie hits the audience over the head with what it doesn't do. It sets itself up and then then there are no payoffs. At every turn one can feel the conspicuously bad writing. The movie started strongly, with a desert-road car-race between an army truck and some teenagers. But it was peppered with those little misdirections that foreshadow the crap to come. CGI prairie-dogs. They were okay. But, they were eerily foreboding the broken promise to use CGI only when necessary.The first ""jarring"" moment is when the race is not brought to any conclusion and is then discarded as irrelevant -- already the movie is starting to feel a little clumsy, like a first draft.The warehouse action scene was good strong, action. I could find flaws with it (for there were flaws with it) but that would play into the hands of those who are determined to brand dislikers of the movie ""nitpickers"".Okay, so we're past the warehouse. Nuke scene. It's not just implausible. It cuts the nose off the whole movie. Let's imagine the nuke scene had been placed at the END of the movie. At least then, we'd have thought ""God! It's the end of the series and Indy may actually truly die!"". It would be impossible for this scene to NOT be entertaining. Also, by putting the nuke scene at the start, it more or less declares Indy to be hyper-robust and nearly immortal, and so later action scenes such as fist-fights lose all their gravity. To survive a nuke at the end of the movie would have been a great series closure -- he's survived this unfamiliar technology in the most daring resourceful way possible. But that brings me on to another gross flaw in this movie. It gets all the hard things right(pulling off an older Indy, choreography, some physical action, etc), and gets all the easy things conspicuously wrong. For example, I thought it would have been the obvious choice to put the nuke scene at the end.But here's another example.There's a scene in which Indy and Mutt walk into a tomb, walk about for about ten minute, then walk out, with no challenge whatsoever. God! How easy it would have been! to spice up the scene with a comedic booby-trap sequence or something. Instead we got a painfully disengaging overwrought verbal exposition about crystal skulls.Also buttock-clenchingly bad was the fake indoorsy look of some of the jungle and tomb sets. I don't know if the sets were truly bad or if the photography just brought out the worst in them, but I noticed, without trying to notice. Note that I also noticed this in a jungle scene in Temple, but I would extend the same criticism to that also. But Temple had so many redeeming features that it's not worth criticising.The sound-track felt like driving around in an aeroplane that never truly lifted off the ground. It seems to build up to the Indy melody, but also falls short to breaking out into it. The action follows the same pattern. There were only two truly impressive action scenes in this movie: The fist-fight among the ants, the bike chase........and maybe Indy swinging from the lamp....and even these had problems which could easily have been removed. The final one-third of the movie(post-waterfall) left me speechless. There was no more movie after that, only moving picture. It consists of characters walking from one room to another, and that's about it. ""Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease, something happen!"", I was begging, for the sake of the audience. ""Just cut our losses and finish with a decent set piece. Maybe a gun-fight amongst the temple ruins? Something adequately Indy-ish? Then let's get out of here, safe in the knowledge that what we saw was oddly okay rather than oddly dreadful"".Instead, Indy was pretty much written out of the story here.It ran out of steam and disappeared in a puff of CGI.Like a rushed essay at the end of an exam.Conclusion? Disengaging and buttock-clenchingly discordant, with just enough decent action to make it worthwhile.~Iain",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1565,snakeeye-5,Sorry Indy......You're finished!!!,2,18 June 2008,"When I heard that this film was given the green light I was very eager to see what would lay in store for Indy this time round. When Spielberg was saying that they had rejected many scripts because they were waiting for that one special piece of writing that would allow them to make an Indy film that the fans deserved, I really did believe him. I thought that after nineteen years the script they must have settled on would undoubtedly be magical. Pffft....how naive was I? Terrible plot, too many characters leading to lack of development, awful dialogue, desperate introduction of a young sidekick, an overdose on nostalgia, no jaw dropping stunts, far too much CGI, far too many clichés, embarrassing attempts at humour which don't pay off and the biggest mistake of all - allowing the world of Indiana Jones to cross over from fiction to science-fiction.This is your typical mainstream Hollywood rubbish.

I am however a big fan of Spielberg, Lucas, and Indiana Jones. Having this review coming out of a Indy fan, I can easily say that this was a very entertaining movie, and it gave me one of the most fun times I've ever had in a theater.It gave me a chance to actually see my favorite Movie Hero on the big screen. I can fully understand why some people were disappointed, and I think the reason for the disappointment was the anticipation. If you see this and expect it to be as good as Raiders, Doom, or Crusade, of course one is going to be disappointed, thats because the Indiana Jones trilogy (in my opinion) is the best trilogy ever made.Call me an optimist or whatever, but I gave Skull a 10 out of 10, then again I also gave the rest of the trilogy a 10. If your a Jones fan that just wants to be entertained and have a good time, you are going to love Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

Unconvincing bad guys in the form of Russians with no character development, physically impossible action effects with crappy CGI (even for 2008), silly sci-fi theme and creatures. Are audiences happy nowadays to be spoon-fed garbage nonsense as long as it is sufficiently action-packed?? Producers seem to think they can get away with anything now (starting in the mid-2000s) as long as there is enough computer generated effects.

Firstly, Dr.Jones in is the middle of a nuclear bomb testing site and survives, how? By climbing in a fridge, yes a fridge - oh don't worry, it's lined with lead so it's safe.The sheer blast (which you see) of the bomb, blows up the whole street, fake people, houses, cars, everything. The fridge, in which he jumped inside in the last few valuable seconds he had before the blast, was absolutely cannoned across the testing site. No man could survive a blast, OK your thinking, I'm being picky, no I'm seriously not, even my girlfriend turned to me and said.""That's just plain stupid"" It looks ridiculous, I'd be embarrassed to have made a film with this scene in seriously.Nevermind the Aliens!! WTF?? That had to be to cheesiest thing I've ever seen in any movie. A stupid cartoon alien (CGI - which was terrible in my opinion) blasting off into space in a HUGE stupid UFO....Seriously.George Lucas + Aliens = Starwars on smack.I'd give it a proper review but I seriously can't take this film seriously.Harrison and Shia however, were awesome, two very talented actors as we all know. It's just a shame that they had to throw in aliens and so much CGI. Other than that, it had the potential to be something very special.P.S Extreme cheese ball moment at the end when the doors fly open with the wind and Indi's hat falls at the feet of Mutt....oh dear.

1569,jsbgaarder,its just OK.,6,14 November 2016,"I know that I've missed Indiana Jones, more than I thought. But I was afraid that ""Crystal Skull rich"" would be a disappointing experience, measured against the three classics from the 1980s. Fortunately, I can announce that my worries proved to be completely unfounded.The film surpasses my expectations by a wide margin! This is classic Spielberg entertainment, brimming with action, humor and charm. Indy meets!Hunting new tax The year is 1957, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is approached by the young rebel Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). He needs help to find her mother and fill her uncle, who has disappeared in South America.Fill uncle, an old friend of Indy, was looking for a crystal skull and a legendary city of gold. Thus, the pursuit of a new tax in time, but bad Communists are after them, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett).Indy in the nuclear age It took only three minutes of the film before I understood that everything was right. The right feeling seated immediately, and the first half hour is absolutely stunning, with perhaps some of the best moments throughout the Indy saga!It has a lovely drive, with the good old mood, although the period details is another. Indy in the nuclear age is quite a sight! Spielberg & Co. shows that they are still able to make glittering adventure of the highest quality.nostalgic soar Photographer Janusz Kaminski has filmed colorful tableaux with nostalgic flavor. John Williams has composed great and sweeping adventure music based on familiar themes. Michael Kahn has edited the film and created a great rhythm of the narrative.Midway limping albeit slightly. The pace drops, and dialog not the story forward well enough. But this persists fortunately not long enough to ruin. And the finale is a demonstration of how to create a truly cinematic adventure!Perfect Harrison Ford Some thought maybe that 65-year-old Harrison Ford is too old to play Indiana Jones? Forget it! He tackles the role perfectly, and also has received Shia LaBeouf to conquer.LaBeouf is a great match for Ford and they form a tandem with a huge potential. Indiana Jones is the seasoned veteran, Mutt the impatient whippersnapper. Otherwise, it's fun to see Cate Blanchett as head of the Communist villains, and the film also has some other pleasant surprises up its sleeve.unbeatable charm ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is just going to be a super success. The film is inconceivable good when it is good and there is the almost the whole way. It is simply a horrible pleasant reunion with an old hero.Movie Heroes come and go, but Indy has an unbeatable charm that the others do not have. It signaled overt that there are opportunities for more adventure",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1570,uncle_jimbo,Complete Disaster.,3,23 May 2008,"This is a film that I have to question why it was made. I don't question why a fourth Indiana Jones film was made, I question why *this film* as it is was made. Indiana Jones is a very special franchise, and this film was never going to live up to that. One couldn't have expected anything else. But the fact that THIS is the new Indiana Jones movie is unbelievable.The first three tell extraordinary stories and make them seem plausible. That's what was special, you watched those movies and thought that this could actually happen, that it could be real. You experienced the adventure. Take that away and you get this movie. This time, you experience being in a movie theater for two hours wondering what you're watching. You just have to wonder. Why this script, after reportedly rejecting so many others?There was no suspension of disbelief at any point in the whole movie. None. The script plays out like a bad action movie that takes itself seriously. The humor is forced, it's like they figured out that the originals were funny and they tried to replicate it. The homages scattered throughout the film seem tacked on and over-deliberate. The clichéd performances, including the truly dreadful performance by Shia LaBeouf kill the already poor dialog. It doesn't seem at any point natural or real, or even vaguely believable.Not only is this a bad Indiana Jones film, this is a bad film. Period.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1571,JonTid,not an Indiana film,5,21 May 2008,"first of I have to say that this was a good film but was certainly not an Indiana Jones film. Even though he is a good actor, Harrison Ford is far far to old to be in it, it was like looking at your grandfather who was young and fit once, getting punched repeatedly by some Russian. The whole plot to the film was far to futuristic and not at all like the other three movies as a lot of unnecessary CGI was used which made it feel unbelievable whereas the old films you could really believe what was happening. The ending was predictable and dreadful and Ray WInstone's character got on your nerves almost as much as Jar Jar Binks. overall I think the film by itself was good but should in no means be credited as part of the three masterpieces created before it. A good way to think what it was like is it was the same feeling you got from Star Wars Episode 1, good but not a good Star Wars film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1572,micksutton-1,Bitterly disappointed,3,22 May 2008,"WARNING  CONTAINS SPOILERSI have been a life long Indiana Jones fan, I can cast my mind back and remember seeing ""Raiders"" for one of my early birthdays and then seeing 'Temple of doom"" and ""last crusade"" at the cinema. So you can imagine my trepidation when I heard that the new film was coming to fruition, after all this was going to be an addition to one of the best Trilogies of all times, as well as the resurfacing of one of the (If not the best..) cinematic heroes of all time.To the best of my ability I had avoided all reviews, trailers etc so I could walk into the cinema with an open mind. However after sitting through ""Crystal skull"" I feel as though Lucas and Spielberg have stolen a piece of my childhoodMy open mind did extend to the fact that this was going to be an older Indiana who would be older and as such calmer, more reflective. However this ""open mind"" did not extend to the ""slap stick"" routines of him falling over, which although they occurred in the previous films did not transfer over, as this is supposed to be less rash and more contemplative Dr Jones. As a standalones the cast members are either recently established or veterans of the game, Shia LaBeouf (Who I thought was incredible in Transformers) had no chemistry at all with Harrison Ford. Much the same can be said for Karren Allens character, admittedly the film is trying to suggest that both characters have mellowed in their old age, but it was such a waste if you can cast your mind back to the Marion of Raiders, who was such a match for Indy. There was no inkling of that dynamism at all, in fact the only reason she appeared to be there was for the sub plot of father and son meeting each other. Ray Winstone, what can I say, Nill by mouth, Scum, Love honour and obey A gem of an actor, but reduced to a confused character, there was no development at all, was he good, was he bad, who cares, I didn't at the end.Raiders centred on the Ark of the Covenant, Temple of doom, the evil Kali god, Last Crusade centres on the Holy Grail and Crystal skull centres on AliensAliens.!!! Bit of a jump there Steven (Or is it George.!!), as I said I had deliberately avoided reading anything Re Crystal skull so it did come as a bit of a surprise when the plot was revealed, it did not work.!!!, previous dealings had revolved around the paranormal or religious texts, although on the previous outings they have all had supernatural endings, they were executed in a such a manner that the viewer was watching in awe, however in this particular outing I found myself watching is disbelief at such a poor close (Not taking into account the outrageous rip offs from The Mummy and from the original Tomb Raider game on the Play Station 1).I could be mistaken, but I have a strong suspicion that George Lucas may have tampered a little too much, there were definite ""director"" elements of Parts 1,2 and 3 of the Star Wars saga in Crystal Skull, which did not transfer across. An instance of this being the scene were Harrison Ford climbs into the lead lined fridge, which protects him from the atomic explosion and then his subsequent landing.!!! I cringed, as did my entire row in the cinema. I am aware that Lucas was involved in the previous trilogy, however if his involvement had ended with R2-D2 being part of the carvings in another underground temple, (As in Raiders) Crystal skull may have been passable as a film as opposed to soul destroying inept All in all, bitterly disappointing, I would not voluntarily watch this again, never mind buy it on DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1573,jgoodburn,Worse than Mission to Mars,4,4 June 2008,"I was bored. My wife was bored. We were both Indy fans, and were really eager to see this film. Unfortunately, this was the biggest letdown since ""Mission to Mars"", which had a stronger script and much better cinematography, and that was still a yawn. This film is akin to suffering through watching someone over-the-shoulder play an early-'80s Japanese video-game, only in that scenario, you at least want to have a try at the game.The dialogue was weak, the action was filmed mostly in front of a green-screen, which may be why the acting seemed flat. There was no passion or chemistry between the actors, little character development, and an entire history of Indiana's wife and child are explained in a single argument that lasts an intolerable 10 minutes. Within seconds of the argument being over but unresolved, they are suddenly and inexplicably best friends again. Indy's wife also seemed strangely happy and disconnected from the reality of life-threatening situations. Since this was the 1950's, it is impossible that she was on Lorazepam.There is the cliché quicksand scene, and if you look real closely, it seems they wearing a burlap bag when they are extracted. Their clothes aren't even dirty or wrinkled. Amazing.And then there is the classic Spielberg-ish ""cutesy"" groundhogs and monkeys that are fine for the kids, but are distracting and annoying.Ultimately, I cannot feel that I can ""believe"" this film, which is a shame, because I really wanted to get into it. Go see this film with the kids, because it is more of a cartoon for them. If you are a fan of the first three, you will be disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1574,XXCentury,1.4 hrs of cheese and authentic stupidity.,1,28 May 2008,"IT'S THE GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENT I've had in a movie this year, or for the past 3 years.Even the Pirates' and Star Wars' sequels, though rather loath, were still better than this! Come on, even the ""Temple Of Doom"" was a masterpiece if compared to this. I give it ""1"" - i.e. above zero - only because Cate Blanchett was superb.The only thing this movie can boast is a complete absence of writing. We've got 1.4 hours of cheese and authentic stupidity, with one of the worst examples of directing I've ever seen.Spielberg went out of his mind with his obsession about the Rosewell thing. That could somehow get along in ""Taken"", but putting it into an Indiana Jones film is a crime against good taste.""The Last Crusade"" remains unbeaten, the best one of the Indiana Jones franchise, and the only other Spielberg's adventure film besides ""Jurassic Park I"" that really shows some artistic highs.So, to sum it all up, we have got some kind of prequel to ""Taken"", totally lowered down to a teenage junk like ""Transformers"", which could be titled as ""Indiana Jones and the Mummy and Mummy Returns, the National Treasure II, and the skulls of the Aliens"".But those films were A LOT better...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1575,M_Robber,"Wanted a blend between Raiders and Crusade, ended up with a cocktail worse than Doom.",5,23 May 2008,"In anticipation of this film I read a number of articles and excited myself by guessing at what everyone's favourite archaeologist would be up to this time, and where his adventures would lead him. After watching the film, I almost wish he'd stayed home.I went in hoping to watch an Indiana Jones film, but five minutes in it was starting to look more like a hybrid of National Treasure and Close Encounters. Not a good mix. I'm sure many would argue that with all the supernatural stuff Indy got involved in during the previous films, aliens are an acceptable leap. The Nazis were after the occult, the Commies are after advanced technology. Indy goes from pre-World War, to the early Cold War. The shift does not sit well with me - Bond was the Cold War spy, not Indie. Everyone may argue that aliens fit into the supernatural plots of the previous films, but that's because the term supernatural is way too vague. Indy films are about the OCCULT, and aliens to not fit into that term. So Lucas and Spielberg wanted to make Indy deal with crystal skulls? Fine! But give me Mayan prophecies, give me Atlantis on steroids, anything but aliens. Indy films are focused on the occult, and that this one isn't really spoils it.Unfortunately, the poorly chosen plot is not the film's only problem. From the action packed get-go, there's never the same sense of excitement as in the old films. The characters go from one sticky situation to the next, as they of course should in an Indie film, but they only seem to be in any real danger once or twice. Those situations, where we wince in sympathy as we did when the spiked ceiling came down in Doom, or Indy walked blindly over a precipice in Crusade, all have one thing in common. No CGI. Not that CGI shouldn't have been used, but it's a muscle flexed too often that leads the characters into downright embarrassing sequences, prime among them is a Tarzan-like monkey-aided assault on a jeep. The film just does not have the same sense of peril for the characters that a good Indy film should have.That being said, there are good aspects to the film as well. Ford glides seamlessly into the role of Indie once again, and the chemistry between him and Allen (Marion) flares up as bright as ever as soon as they meet. LaBeouf does it well as Mutt, a good sidekick who isn't too intrusive (except for an embarrassing monkey-related incident), and I can easily see him donning Indy's hat. There are many good one-liners, and while some of the comedic aspects flop, most can elicit a chuckle or two.All in all it's a relatively entertaining film, but it just isn't worthy of its predecessors, even Doom. I find it such a shame that this is how Ford will exit the franchise, because even though LaBeouf may be a good replacement, it just won't be the same.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

So imagine my anticipation of the fourth film, which I have finally seen not so long ago!I'm not going to verbosely describe my impressions of ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", suffice it to say that I liked it and found it thoroughly enjoyable. You can just look at my vote and not read any further. And if you haven't seen the new Indiana Jones movie, go and see it, especially if you liked the previous three installments of the adventures of everyone's favourite archaeologist.I just have a few nitpicks: I think Spielberg and Co used a tad too much CGI (oh, so damn green screen backgrounds!) and it didn't look great, especially compared to other Spielberg's movies, felt rushed a bit, I would've preferred more practical effects and scenes; no offence to Ray Whinstone, but what was the point of his character at all, betray Indy a couple of times?; and that nuclear blast, though I understand the idea behind it, I still think that was too much.But don't listen to my nagging, see it and make up your own mind.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1579,outside_centre13,Liked it....but can't seemed to love it,8,29 May 2008,"I'm not really for all of the negative comments made made other users. I entered the film feeling optimistic, as I am a huge Indy fan, and I have to say the first half of the film was well done. The second half did become a little less realistic and confusing, yet this notion is apparent in the first three. For instance in Raiders a man's face melts and another man explodes due to the ""power of god"". In temple a man's heart is ripped out and he continues to live. In Crusades the villain drinks some water from the wrong cup and ages rapidly before being thrown across the room, due to some weird force. All of these unrealistic traits appear in the earlier films and also in the new one and people seem to hate these new less traits. This I do not understand and it annoys me as well. I certainly wouldn't give the film 10/10, due to these new ideas. I know I have been saying how it matches the other films, yet the idea of aliens and such is a little too far. Lucas appears to think that Aliens would be a good idea after all of the other films focus on religion in some way. There are so many other plots they could have used instead of using an idea as far-fetched as Aliens. Due to this problem I can't love this film like I love the others. However if you watch the film from a film-making point of view the film is well done. Good FX, good camera work (obviously) and also mainly good acting from most of the cast. La Beuf does stand out as his role is a very different to his other roles in films like Transformers and Disturbia.

1581,twistedcol-1,Indiana Jones and the ultimate disappointment!,2,24 May 2008,"OK, its been two days now since i saw this film and for those two days i have been thinking hard, and re-watching the originals trying to articulate why this film which i had been looking forward to like no other film is so unbelievably bad. I loved the originals and am a huge Spielberg fan, which i suppose makes this film twice as depressing. I think it will be easier to address the mountain of reasons this film is so bad by separating them into four points. So with a heavy heart and a deep breath, here goes.1. STORYThe story is terrible.Aliens? Who in gods name thought it was a good idea to cross Indian Jones with the x files? It doesn't work, it doesn't feel right. And at the finale(and bear in mind i went opening night, these were people who really wanted to watch this film) people were laughing in disbelief at the out of place, over the top cgi mess of a flying saucer that popped out of the ground and flew away. And a few actually walked out!! Hes an archaeologist, we want him looking for something old and from this planet, it doesn't really matter what, its the adventure and the character interaction that matters and this was lacking.2.CHARACTERS AND DIALOGUE.Worst character and worst acting goes to Miss Blanchett. Possibly the worst and most misjudged baddie ever, complemented by the worst accent ever, a strange mix of polish Australian i think! In the previous films the baddies and co stars have been largely unknown, maybe there is something to be said for this. Generally an uninspired character with no depth. Indy. I wanted so badly for him to be able to still pull this off but alas he did seem just too old. And a bit feeble at times. But it wasn't just the age i don't think ford really got the character right. At times he did but at times he seemed like a bad caricature of himself. His dialogue didn't help. Clunky and lazy at best. The sly humour of the original films a distant memory. Mutt. This character committed the biggest crime of all, Spielberg and Lucas desperate to try to establish him as the new Indy thrust him upon the film with such heavy handedness that at times Indy feels like the co star in his own film. He is a crap annoying character Mr Lucas so scrap any plans you have. Your creativity peaked 30 years ago then dropped off pretty sharply. The rest of the co stars just had no depth whatsoever and were hampered by bad dialogue and worse directing. How Spielberg looked at the dailies and liked what he saw is beyond me. I was excited when i heard Karen Allen was back but she was terrible. And the scenes between her and Indy were very unnatural and forced3.C.G.II believed Spielberg when he said ""we will only use cgi when something cannot physically be done"" Which i suppose in a way is true. But he neglected to mention that the action would be so pathetically and laughably over the top that there would be shoddy cgi splashed all over the place because none of it could be physically be done! One scene sticks in my mind like a computer generated turd! The character of mutt and the polish/Australian baddie standing on separate vehicles which are racing through a rain forest decide to have a sword fight! Then at some point mutt ends up with one foot on one vehicle and one on the other for about five minutes.....while still engaged in the sword fight! WTF?????? Then a little while later they amazingly out do the awfulness of this scene by having mutt get back into the convoy he has been separated from by swinging Tarzan style from vine to vine with an army of monkeys. Laugh/cry, Laugh/cry I couldn't decide. When we didn't have cgi, i personally think that the lack of technology acted as an unintentional yardstick for film makers. Unintentional but reliable. If it went too far you couldn't physically do it. And that was that. But that was a good thing. If it cant be done then maybe it shouldn't be done, maybe you've got carried away and its time to reign in your imagination. One thing that stuck in my mind throughout this debacle was that the simple but brilliant motorbike chase in last crusade was better than any of this cgi mess being served up to me. When will people realise that cgi doesn't look real and takes all the excitement out of action sequences?4.OVERALL Spielbergs deft hand and instincts for fun and comic moments are gone. Sure he can still make good dramas and political message films, but we are saturated with directors who fill that quota. Spielberg was the great entertainer, making popcorn movies of the highest calibre. When i picture my childhood i see his films. And i suppose in a way going to see this film i was secretly hoping that it would be a return to form and maybe lead to a return of his making these kind of films. God knows we need some fun in this world! But sadly this is not the case. I would have been disappointed if it had been an average film, but for it to be this awful is difficult to comprehend.Maybe I'm being to harsh and you have or will enjoy the film, and if so more power to you. But if you are a fan of the originals and you are going to see it my advice to you is this, Have one of the original films and an alcoholic drink of your choice at the ready for when you get home. Trust me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1582,bass_boast,"Another Fun, Entertaining Indiana Jones Adventure!",10,24 May 2008,"After being brought up on the 3 previous films, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade, I was hesitant about seeing this new film. However, my doubts were soon proved wrong with a typical, highly eventful start to the film. I felt it lacked the sharp story telling evident at the start of Raiders of the Lost Ark but still had a very good and more importantly, highly entertaining beginning. The film only picked up from there.After the thickening of the plot with the introduction of a new character, the witty and knife-armed Mutt Williams played by the fantastic Shia LeBeouf, and a mysterious letter, a series of events unfold in typical Indy fashion. From an exhilarating car chase through the university to a 50's milkshake bar brawl which reminded me of the first Back to the Future film! It had the fun, comic elements that have stood out in past Indiana Jones films and also had the expected but brilliant Russian bad girl who was reminiscent of her German counterpart in the previous film.George Lucas has always said in any interview I've seen him in that he is happy if he can get a bunch of people in a room and have those people be entertained by what he creates, he is a happy man. I can say without doubt I was thoroughly entertained by this motion picture. All in all a classic Indiana Jones film, fans will not be disappointed!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

But I think this movie is pure fun from beginning to end. I never felt bored. The fact I had to get up to go to the bathroom killed me because I had to miss some of the film. I think the backlash is because people had specific expectations and the movie did not meet their preconceived notions.I didn't ready any articles pre-movie and went in with an open mind. I found the movie absolutely delightful. Action-packed and fun-filled for 2 hours.The movie wasn't perfect, but the fun moments made up for the flaws. There are plenty of jewels of scenes.Enjoy Indiana Jones for what it is: A fun movie that's willing to laugh at itself and give into the ridiculousness in all the best ways.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1584,macejones69,"19 years, worth the wait.",9,25 May 2008,"19 years have come and gone and finally we see a new Indiana Jones movie. Was it worth the wait? Honestly? YES. What a great film this turned out to be. Finally a film that lived up to expectations. Harrison Ford was excellent, still rolling out his funny and witty punchlines as in the originals. Newcomers to the film franchise Cate Blanchett, Shia Lebeuf and Ray Winstone gave strong performances and were a joy to watch. The storyline was very well written and never was there a dull moment in the film. However my favourite Indiana Jones movie will always be 'Raiders of the lost ark', but Crystal Skull fits in at second place. I cant help wondering is this the last we will see of Indiana Jones? I really hope not. What a Brilliant series of films which will stay in my movie collection till the day I die.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1585,ollirrap,Indiana Jones and the Pooly Orchestrated Film,4,29 May 2008,"I was pumped by the commercials and I had my fingers crossed that the movie would rise to expectations, especially since I was intrigued from reading more of the backstory to Indy's life previously. I was encouraged that Ford was playing the appropriately aged character which would introduce a new facet (possibly realism) to Indy's exploits. I was wrong. Spielberg and Lucas have continued to push me into being a grumpy old man. This comment from a review of the movie I read today sums up this feeling, ""... for those of you that feel that the new Star Wars Movies robbed your childhood, expect some molestations from Uncles' George and Steven..."" The story, the acting, the effects...all completely over the top and plastic. There was no character in the characters, including Indy. As for Marion, the banter is almost there in the beginning, like they filmed a run through. Then her character disappeared into a wide-smiling idiot who was infatuated with Indy. It was like seeing Carrie Fisher now, compared to slave Leah. As for the Mutt character. I agree with some reviews that the actor, whatever his name, comes off as very likable. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY HE WAS COMPLETELY WRONG FOR THE PART! He plays a greaser supposedly running from mainstream society. He sucks in that part. They play up his switchblade, but he never uses it. And the epitome of cross promotion, they continue to focus on his Harley for the first half of the film, even flying it to South America only to be left at a grave site when they are captured by the Soviets. I kept thinking, ""wasn't that motorcycle important for some reason?"" I was very frustrated the entire film with thoughts of how scenes and plot points could have worked with just a tweak. It was mostly poorly contrived cheap gags and mindless action without Indy tension. In the other movies, events and artifacts were there for reasons and it FELT as if you were solving the riddles with Indy. In this one, you are lead by a leash through the plot with an occasional unexplained event (i.e. scary little blowgun fighters at a gravesite, which are there just for action and have no explained context). What I always liked about the Indy movies is that they SEEMED epic in scope. The vision was wide and were able to take you to new places, even Temple of Doom. This installment had a cloistered feel to it, like you felt you were on the greenscreen soundstage with the actors. Finally, even with the supernatural overtones in the previous movies, I could suspend my disbelief and indulge in the story. I just watched all of the previous three in the last week and still had this feeling and even picked up on little things that I never noticed previously that added more realism (i.e. Indy and Marcus briefly discussing international agreements on artifact recovery in the beginning of Raiders). This movie along with its forced story never allowed my disbelief to be harnessed because the BANG was intentionally or unintentionally delivered in the beginning of the movie. SPOILER - the crystal skulls are of aliens! I don't have an issue with this, but done very poorly in a franchise that thrived on suspense, mystery, and tension. Bad casting, bad acting, bad writing, bad CGI, bad rising action, bad believability, bad memories. I want to cry...like they murdered my grandpa. Overall, this movie had great potential with everything that it contained, but its orchestration completely fell short in becoming more than the sum of its parts. Not the worst movie, but disappointing.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1586,modelmode,Unfortunately... Horrible.,3,22 May 2008,"I love Indiana Jones. I love Harrison Ford. I wish to god this movie had not been made. I wish someone had the courage to speak up and tell George and Steven that this script was crap, but they did'nt. Thats what it boils down to, a really bad script. The cast gave it their all but, the mess they had to work with brought them down. The dialogue was so stilted as to be laughable. The plot twists were'nt actually twists at all, considering each one was telegraphed. I hope there is another movie, I really do. It just can't end on this sour note. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you. Rent this one when it's on the cheap shelf, or don't see it at all. You won't miss anything.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1587,Heidelbach50,Certainly not the best Indy....,5,24 May 2008,"Having awaited this movie ever since it was announced a year ago, I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth. This movie reminded me of how much Lucus has lost it, and Spielberg's insatiable obsession with aliens. I always viewed the Indy films for what they were: a part-time professor toiling the world for ancient artifacts and being chased by Nazis. I never ever imagined that Indy would be paired up with sci-fi alien creatures. That's probably the part of this movie that upset me most was seeing the classic Indy premise being taken over by modern day sci-fi adventure saga. As for the plot itself, sorry guys I don't even think Indy could survive a nuclear blast. That was probably the most retarded thing I have ever seen since the introduction of Jar Jar Binks in Phantom Menance as a lead character. There were some decent fight scenes, but I needed to see more of the classic Indy complete with whip and gun. The whip had a minor cameo in the beginning but was not seen again. The jungle scene was contrived, as Shia Lebeouf was doing vine tricks that a human couldn't possibly do. As for Lucus losing it creatively, one only has to look at the first two modern day Star Wars movies. I thought if anyone could redeem those travesties, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. This is just another example of how the creators of classic, original, ahead of their times movies should leave well enough alone.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1588,tromnick,Story Way too Out There,5,28 May 2008,"5 Stars for the entertaining action...it was quite refreshing...although cheesy in parts, but cheesy in only an Indiana Jones-type of way, which is OK in my book.It loses the other 5 stars on everything else. The movie was constant motion, there was no time to take a breath and try to understand what was going on. Plus they kept throwing different twists to the storyline one after the other, amidst the constant action...it was just overstimulating, and hard to absorb everything. Times when they would talk about what they were doing went straight over my head, it was too fast...it missed that certain intellectual level of why they were out in the first place.And on that end, the other three were based off of archaeological truth to some point...the stones, the ark, the grail, all of those existed. The crystal skull may not even exist and I wouldn't necessarily put it in the subject of ""archeology"".The story lost its purpose...I had no idea why they were doing what they were doing, and the fact that the bad guys were Commies also lost meaning. The special effects near the end were just unnecessary and unbelievable.And more than all that, it just began to lose its identity as ""Indiana Jones"" like the other three the longer it went along. The beginning was great, but there was less and less of Indy as the story went along, and that was disappointing...we were missing the witty one-liners that Indy would spit out every 5 minutes, especially in the midst of fighting.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie for the action. The car chase scene was great. But as it ended, I couldn't help but have an empty, unsatisfied feeling that left me wanting more, or wanting something different than what I got. maybe if they made it 10 years earlier it would've been better...I think they just waited too long for this one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1589,RickDeckard83,"Thanks George, Thanks Steven, Thanks Harrison!",10,26 May 2008,"Indy is back! The movie is simply great, one of the most entertaining adventure of the last 10 years. Harrison Ford is still in good shape and when I saw Indy's shadow at the beginning, I was very excited. After 5 minutes, I knew that the great atmosphere of the three previous films was back. Shia La Bouef is good as Indy's son and it was a pleasure to see Karen Allen on the screen again. Cate Blanchett is a good villain and Ray Winstone wasn't bad as Mac. I really enjoyed the movie and the sci-fi plot. I really don't understand people complaining about some scenes like the one with the monkeys or the one with the falls. It's Indiana Jones!

1590,Mattjackson666,"Indiana returns, an honest review",7,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones returns after a lengthy 19 years providing a decent movie which just about delivers the goods. The only problem with the latest Indy, is it lacks the sharpness and speed which the other movies thrived on. The real issues with this movie don't come from Harrisons age, UFO's or annoying characters but a slight lack of originality and pace. At the core however this is an Indiana Jones movie and there are certainly moments when that shines through. Having said that there are unfortunately moments which are fairly cringe worthy or unnecessarily over the top. Overall the movie is fairly good and will satisfy most of it's audience. It is the weak script and surprisingly Spielberg which have let slip on this movie. You can't honestly say that it has taken almost two decades to come up with this story. I hope that Indy returns in the near future to give a movie kingdom of the crystal skull unfortunately failed to give. Disappointing but not a disaster.

1591,Lucius_Inhuman,Indiana Jones and the close encounters of the lame kind,2,27 May 2008,"I think everyone has been dying to see this since the rumours were confirmed, I certainly was. So in I go, drink in hand and snuggled into the seat for the big show.It started off well with the familiar titles that were last used in the Indy films, nice I thought. Sadly from there on it kind of lost it. In the previous movies you always suspending belief for the fact that the way they told the tales sucked you in. With this one sadly all I found was a bunch of information shoved into the first 10-15mins that I'd never even considered Indy would have been involved in, and it got worse from there on.Visually it was an Indiana film, but I found myself thinking that i'd almost seen some of it before in the second 'The Mummy' film. It was all nice and polished with some stunning CGI and all that, but as quite a few people have seemed to say, its just the plot was so thin any one of us could have probably put our bit into it and come up with something ... better? As an overview to the film i'll tell you the bit that stuck in my mind the most when i left the cinema which to me sums it up. I was impressed by the bit with all the ants because of the reflections they had managed to render on each and everyone of them to move. That was it. Such a good cast as well. But such bad one liners and Indy now pretty much being the destroyer of the witt and heroics of the previous, and it had nothing to do with his age.Compair it to C3PO saying 'i'm beside myself' in Episode 2.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1592,bfalcon-1,Review,6,24 May 2008,"Indiana Jones is back. As much as I was excited to see Harrison Ford swing across the screen in his fedora, I was also very disappointed. 1. The story was so over the top and that it made me cringe. Aliens, really. We waited around for 19 years and aliens is the best that they could do. As soon as the UFO caused the Mayan temple collapse in on it's self, I was done. I understand that there is a supernatural element to the Jones movies, but this went to a place that seemed so unlike the others. 2. I have seen the end of times and his name is Shia Labeuf. This kid annoyed me. If this guy ends up picking up the mantle and continuing his own adventures, then they have lost a fan. He does not even come close to Ford. The swinging from the vines bit was ridiculous. I understand that they may want to have the draw of a younger crowd, but they can do better. 3. CGI. They reason why previous films were so great was how sparse the CGI was. And now it looked like reality was sparse. I know that CGI was not around in abundance back when the first three were made, but come on. This film had so much crappy CGI that it took me out of the film. I guess Lucas has a thing for shitty CGI.I am not saying this movie is bad. But it does not live up to the Indiana Jones franchise in the least. It quickly became, in my eyes, the worst of the series. And to those that say that this is just like Raiders of the Lost Ark, I say nuts to you. This was anything but. This movie had no pacing, no character development, and a terrible story. But it was enjoyable. It was a fun movie no doubt, but as far as Indiana Jones is concerned, it does not make the cut.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

In fact, I found it to be enjoyable.I think by now nearly everyone knows how the movie ends - I'm speaking about the big reveal behind the crystal skull. That's right at the center of most people's grievances with this film. The only way I can respond to those gripes is to ask if they've seen any of the previous films, which were filled with superstition and magic on an equally implausible level. I thought this movie was fun to watch, and while it certainly wasn't my favorite in the series, I thought having the Russian communists acting as surrogate Nazis for the ""bad guys"" in the film was effective and fun.I think the funniest part about this movie is that the internet at large has formed a vigilante mob against anyone who said this film is anything but an abomination. That's really too bad, because the film was a fun adventure movie that brought back a lot of happy memories from the previous three.

1594,greatwhitejawahunter,Run Fat Indy Run,6,16 June 2008,"I went to the midnight showing of Indy 4. But before I did, to kill time I went with some friends to see ""Run Fatboy Run"" starring Simon Pegg. In ""Fatboy"" a man named Dennis who, five years after leaving his pregnant girlfriend at the altar, decides to become a more prominent part of her -- and their son's -- lives again by competing against her new boyfriend in a London marathon. I hope you don't feel spoiled by me telling you that in the end Dennis completes the marathon and wins back the respect of his son, and the heart of his ex-girlfriend. When I saw ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" a few hours later this movie was still fresh in my mind. Now, onto Indy: The aliens in Indy didn't bother me, really. I wish they weren't computer animated, and that they would have made a puppet or had a really skinny guy in an alien costume, like in the X-Files. That would have been fun. But before I talk about what really struck me as disturbing about Indy 4, I'm going to say what I did like about it, for the record: I thought the Russians made great bad guys. They looked almost just like the Nazis. The uniforms were a different color and they spoke Russian instead of German. I'm guessing the average Indy fan can't understand a lick of either language so who cares, right? Other than that they were practically interchangeable. It occurred to me that by setting the movie in South America during the 1950s they could have easily brought back some Nazis because that's where all the Nazis were at that time. But they probably wouldn't have been able to show up out of nowhere and point their machine guns at Indy like the plot required the Russians to do a dozen times or so.I thought it was a nice touch that the villain was a product of the Soviet mind control and telepathy experiments.The quicksand scene may have been the single greatest scene of Harrison Ford's career.I liked that they brought Marion back almost thirty years later. She wasn't the Marion we remember, though. I would have liked it even more if she would have gotten into a drinking contest with the Russians.I liked that Indy survived a nuclear explosion in a lead refrigerator. I know a lot of people complained about this, but really, how else are you going to survive a nuclear explosion? And it's even more plausible than . . . well, I'll get to that later.The flesh eating ants were cool.Now I am going to talk about what really disturbed me about Indy 4, and I'm going to talk about some plot points in detail, so if you haven't seen Indy yet don't say you weren't warned.About three quarters of the way through the movie we discover that Shia Labeouf is really Marion and Indy's love child. You see, Indy and Marion were about to get married, but Indy left her at the alter while she was pregnant. At the end of the movie, Indy wins her back and they get married.Wait a second! I had just seen a movie a few hours earlier where the exact same thing happens! It was called ""Run Fatboy Run."" Is this what Hollywood is teaching us these days? That in the end it really doesn't matter if you are a chubby English bloke or Indiana Jones himself, you can still leave your pregnant girlfriend at the alter, but you will be able to win her affection again? Now what is really more realistic? That these lessons Hollywood is teaching us about how to treat your fiancé are true? Or that in order to survive a nuclear blast simply insert oneself into a lead refrigerator? If a nuclear blast is like hell, with fire and dead and melting things and all that, I suppose one could say that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1595,dbrandstatter,"I loved it, but it was sad at the same time",10,21 May 2008,"I have to admit to be one of the guys who waited for this film for almost 15 years, since the first rumors came up that there will be another Indy movie. I love the character of Indy, and I love the films. Since weeks I just could not believe that I'm actually going to see Indy 4, my most anticipated film of all times. This is is the only film I so much hoped it would be produced, and a dream came true today. This is a film which was made for true fans of Indy, and Mr. Spielberg kept his promise to do this just for the fans. I don't know if the movie appeals to anyone who has not seen the other parts, because there are so many little sidekicks to the other films. The story worked out, and my friends and I had great time watching the film. The showdown was a bit short, I could not believe the film is already over when the credits started. It is generally just sad how people age and time goes on. I think this is also one of the messages of the film. I mean, Harrison still was great, but he got older. It was very sad that Marcus (Denholm Elliot) and Sean Connery as Indy's father were dead. It just felt like... this is Indy's last adventure before retirement. It was very good to see how the character developed, but it left me with a sad but somehow... satisfied feeling. In my opinion, there were a bit too many elements from the other movies, which sometimes felt just a bit like a rip off, but there were also many new elements which were just fantastic and good to see.Finally I want to say, thanks, Steven for doing this film, thanks John for doing a wonderful job by composing the fantastic music of Indy. And Harrisson, you ARE Indiana Jones, without you the character would have never been who he is today. I hope there will be a 5th Indiana Jones. Please do it. Use less CGI.

I love the Indiana Jones films because of the magical mystery ride it takes you on and will suspend belief to a large extent; however, when Indiana Jones is coming face to face with E.T. it is a bit too much. My favourite part of the movie is the 3 minute scene with the janitor from Scrubs in it and that was only because i was excited he was in it. If this was the first Indiana Jones film you had seen you would not want to see the first 3 in fear they were anything like this.

1598,Pearl623,Not as bad as so many think,7,9 June 2008,"While this movie was certainly no ""Last Crusade"" (my absolute favorite), I'm not going to jump all over it like so many others have. Sure, once they got into the temple and things started getting all alien-y, it was weird and disappointing. But I thought otherwise it was a pretty good Indiana Jones movie. Sure, Indy survives a nuclear blast in a refrigerator ... he's Indy! He does crazy, impossible stuff like that. He shoots bazooka's out of moving vehicles and swings on whips. It's what makes his character so amazing. Who else is going to do stuff like that? (Besides maybe 007) I thought the dry humor from the first 3 was definitely still there and the relationship between Indy and Mutt was pretty good. I loved that Indiana called Mutt ""Junior"" at the end. All the throwbacks to the earlier movies (the Ark in the warehouse, the photos of characters who have passed on, Indy mentioning that Mutt's grandpa would be laughing, etc.) were great! I expected to be disappointed in Shia, but he was very good. The character was likable and his performance was believable. He made sense as Henry Jones III. And he did outrageous things too. Of course Indy's son is going to swing on vines like a monkey. It was fun! I even liked that they got married at the end, but I'm a sucker for those kinds of things. It made me laugh that Mutt almost put the hat on, but then Indy took it from him, as if to say, ""Maybe I'm not done with that yet."" I'm sure others will disagree with me, but I'd even go see another sequel with this crew.Now, granted, there were things I didn't like. The nuclear scene didn't really need to be there. Where was all the whip work? I read that Harrison Ford was taking things from people's hands on the set! Why not use that?? The CIA/double/triple agent guy was just irritating. And the aliens ... that's where the movie lost me. Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie. You need flesh and blood enemies. Russians? Fine. But let's just leave it at that.All in all, I thought it was a good movie. Kudos to Harrison Ford for still making me believe he's Indiana Jones, even in his sixties, and looking pretty good for doing too.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

All the cast is perfect, especially H. Ford as Indy. The story and script are okay (with some actually surprising good ideas), the humor hits its target (us) almost each time it is used as one-liners and punchlines, the badies die hard, and the action scenes (almost all of them pursuits) are extremely well made.

1600,hamble,"Time to hang up the whip, Indy",5,22 May 2008,"Saw the new Indy film last night, and in two words: disappointing to poor. Don't want to give anything away, because you'll probably go and see it anyway, but suffice to say it was not up to par. Now I grant you, trying to follow one of the finest trilogies in history 9 years later is never going to be easy, but somehow I thought it would be better than this. There are a few flashes of pure Indy gold, but overall the film feels rushed: the side characters are either not fleshed out enough or just plain annoying; the locations are never given enough time to establish themselves; the set pieces range from ridiculous to mundane with some good in between, and some of the drama and dialogue scenes are clichéd and / or bordering on tedious nostalgia. But basically over all that, the story and characters are just not as compelling, interesting or grounded as any of the previous films. Harrison is good despite his age  LaBeouf shows potential but is underused  Ray Winstone is plain annoying, and I won't give away the rest of the cast, apart from Cate Blanchet, who plays the villain with absolutely no personality or joy at all.To sum up then: Starts off pretty well, though when I saw gophers witnessing some of the action I was immediately worried. Takes a turn for the utterly ridiculous. Comes back down to a better place with an excellent car / motorbike chase. Then it takes off, barely lets up, and becomes more and more ridiculous as it trundles on to an anti-climactic ending.

They're both just obvious cash grabs for fools like us who were hoping for more of the same. As many have mentioned, 3 big scenes are just groaners that ruin the entire experience: 1) Mutt swinging like Tarzan with the monkeys with super-human quickness. Blech. 2) Marion driving (with confidence) over a cliff onto a welcoming tree only to be softly laid into the river. Ugh. 3) Indy surviving the nuclear blast in the lead-lined fridge. Double ugh.Three strikes and you're out. After those individual scenes I was just angry and didn't care what happened the rest of the way.

Who will forget quotes like ""That car belonged to my brother-in-law""? or scenes like the one where IJ, bored, shoots the swordsman without a word? Those movies were exceptional because of a perfect mix between action and humor, and the plots were strong and without any holes. Moreover, the characters were true and well described: think of Sean Connery wonderful role! All the action scenes were ""realistic"" even if we actually know that they could not be: the secret, I think, was Spielberg ability to shave the impossible without falling into unreality. But we all know that after Father (first film) and Son (third one) there was no possibility to increase the level of the mystery but calling the Holy Spirit!

I know it's a movie and it's fiction, but we are talking about archeology, a university teacher that know a lot about history and different cultures; so Peruvias with Mexican accent and dancing mariachi music are are a big mistake. In general the movie is fun, the traditional ""I have a bad feeling about this"", funny scenes, good visual effects.

1604,Rickety-Cricket,Really wanted to like this (some mild spoilers),5,23 May 2008,"I went into this movie hoping that the critics were just being overly harsh and losing sight of the feel of the original Indy films. Sadly, I was wrong. I blame the failure of this movie on the laziness of Spielberg and Lucas. The acting alone was simply unacceptable. Film isn't that expensive, if an actor doesn't deliver a line perfectly, do another take. The dialog made it feel like I was watching a high school play. This worsened once Karen Allen came on the scene. After playing such a bold and vivacious character in Raiders, we see her now reduced to a giggling, dreamy-eyed airhead (ugh, the steering wheel scene). While it was never a mystery (to us) that Mutt was Indy's kid, you would think that a guy who can read a 5,000 year old dead Myan language could have figured that out a little sooner. And poor Kate Blanchett and her tragic Bullwinkle Russian accent. John Hurt was just a major waste of a seasoned actor. And Harrison Ford... I have to give him credit for getting back into shape at 62 but you can't hide the fact that he is still a 62 year old man. The magic just wasn't there. And would it kill them to use the whip once in a while? While I know the previous Indy movies utilized a lot of impossible scenarios (face melting ghosts, life-raft parachutes, heart extracting cult leaders, immortal knights), I really feel like they stepped over the line on this one; The monkey vines, the waterfalls, the refrigerator, the sword-fighting, the siafu ants (which do actually live in the Amazon jungle), the snake rope. I won't even go into the skull. It just felt like everyone was having a little too much fun making this movie and they lost sight of what made the other movies great (and what makes any movie great, for that matter). The directors and actors are supposed to be the ones at work. We're the ones who are supposed to be having fun. Looking around at the dull faces in the audience it's obvious that the only people enjoying themselves were on screen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1605,zhouston,Average and disappointing considering the previous productions,5,28 July 2008,"Average at best. Nothing but a special effects film with a weak story line that cannot be saved by Ford. Karen Allen is weak and shows she is not a very good actress. The kid needs to take acting lessons. He was not believable in his role. I am surprised that Spielberg would direct this picture considering his reputation. This picture was made purely to satisfy the fans of the series and fill bank accounts of people who don't care about the quality of what they're making. It should of been left well enough alone. Harrison, don't try to pretend your a young man anymore. Stick to parts that suit your talents and your age. This picture only goes to prove you can't or at least shouldn't go back just for the sake of doing so.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1606,fenomenalnite,Good return of Indiana Jones,7,25 May 2008,"Attention.There are minor spoilers here.Honestly i am very big fan of the old 3 movies,because i like adventure movies and and i also such big fan of Spielberg,Lucas,John William,whole crew.I didn't came too excited in the cinema.I knew that its impossible to compare the old 3 movies with this one.When i go out of the cinema,hmm i wasn't very much satisfied.Its not the movie i have seen,but is a good movie.Indiana has so many fans and all came so damn excited about this movie.Thats the problem of all,they want this to be the best Indiana Jones and has so high and nearly impossible expectations.I heard Lucas sayed that this movie will be like Phantom Menace.But when you go in cinema just to enjoy a film for 2 hours,this is a very good choice. Harrison Ford is old,but he still feels like the old Indiana Jones.He even shows sense of humor in many scenes.The only thing i don't like in him was that he wasn't much like a human being in this movie.He does many impossible things that i haven't expected from him to do.I like him in the old movies,because he was really smart,but normal smart.In this movie i feel that he knows like 100 languages,dead languages like maya's.Which is no way he could know them.Also for a 64 year old he is really active and does many impossible things......surviving nuclear explosion.....WTF.OK all my huge respect to Spielberg,but thats just insane.Thats one of the most unrealistic scenes i have ever seen in my life.I like the story honestly,nowadays is really hard to come with a good and original adventure story.i myself try to wright adventure and fantasy stuff and so know how really hard is.Many ppl don't like the idea of aliens in the movie,that its not typical for him.Well i like that.Many ppl forgot that 19 years are gone,so if they come with simple adventure story,it will fail hugely.Look at pirates of the Caribbean.IT has fantasy elements.I doubt that without it,it would have the same success.Well i wish tho to see more aliens in the movie,they show for what like 5 min?!.I can comment a lot more,but i don't want all ppl who read to be bored:).My final conclusion is that this is the weakest from all 3 movies,but still a good adventure movie,who has everything.Good story,music,acting,directing,action,humor,some romance,adventure.So if someone want to see good entertaining movie for 2 hours,there is no better choice then this:)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1607,poopdog94,"Thank you George Lucus, for I have never seen a movie before in my life.",2,29 May 2008,"I would like to thank Mr. Lucus for a number of things in this movie.The first thing I noticed was the total lack of plot depth. Because he involved my tired-after-work mind so little, I was able to leave the theater less disappointed than if I had any emotional, intellectual, or even adventurous connection to this film.Another thing I want to thank Mr. Lucus for is the ease with which I was able to follow the plot. There is certainly not enough intellect in my, or the average movie-goer's, mind to put together the simple story points without an outburst from any of the characters, seemingly taking turns blurting out exactly what they're going to do next.So thank you George, I may not have been able to handle anything with surprises or anything requiring thought.I would like to thank Harrison Ford at this point for being able to read and decipher an ancient dead language in 30 seconds and from opening a journal to one page.And for studying Mayan too. I don't think a single person on earth, let alone a ""part-time"" (really funny stuff, George) History/Archaeology professor, knows Mayan right off the bat or can understand exactly what a fluent person is saying right off the bat. I know it's just a movie, but seriously, I would have more approval of C3-P0 showing up and translating than that. Also, Mayans were not in the Amazon, that one ""lost"" tribe was. They didn't speak Mayan, this was even stated during the movie. Good try trying to slip it by though, the average movie goer is probably pleased.Thank you for hiring people with no aiming guns experience. I know that during the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies, you were pretty good at hiring people who were bad shots, but this kind of pushed it. A lot kind of pushed it. Like 5 people 5 feet away, fully automatic Indy/friends never get shot once pushed it. Even the rock slinging Amazonians were better shots. But thank you anyway, I'm glad all characters involved will be able to make another sequel.Thank you Mister Lucus for revisiting so much material from the previous Indiana Jones movies that you had very little new material to write. Of course, I shouldn't be the one thanking you, you should be thanking yourself seeing as you wrote it. Pat on the back time! Again,thank you for everything George. You've done wonders in the past decade to ruin your reputation and the films you did in the past. You've also supported the ever more true statement that there hasn't been a new idea in 30 years. As long as people pay attention to you and you're rich!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1608,joeferris001,Mildly entertaining but not worthy of bearing the Indiana Jones name,5,21 November 2008,"First of all, I'm a great fan of the Indiana Jones franchise and love the adventures and characters of the three initial movies. However the fourth title seems to lack the charisma of the original trilogy and generally failed to intrigue and excite me. So let's start with the 'stunts', they are just too outrageous, even for an Indiana Jones movie. Just a few examples are surviving a nuclear explosion in a refrigerator, Shia Lebouf (he did well considering the plot) instantaneously befriending a group of Amazonian monkeys, swinging vine to vine catching up with a fast moving set of trucks. Not to mention rafting down a gigantic waterfall in a 1950s boat/car thing, surviving unharmed of course. So OK, we accept a certain degree of stupidity and ridiculousness when it comes to Indiana Jones stunts but really I think this is taking it a little too far. Secondly I thought the acting was surprisingly poor. Harrison Ford seemed awkward and false during some speaking parts. He just doesn't seem the Indiana Jones he did in the originals. Sure it's been almost 20 years since the last movie and Ford isn't what he was simply due to age. What also didn't help was Spielberg's persistence in trying to remind us that this is an IJ film, what with a glimpse at the Ark of the Covenant, the return of Karen Allen, etc etc. So now to the big disappointment, the plot. It's poor. The story just isn't great at all. The mystery and historical reference isn't there like the original films. Im pretty good with my history and am pretty sure there was no historical myth about a kingdom of the crystal skull. Please correct me if i'm wrong. Even though the trilogy has elements of supernatural beings, they are somehow believable and acceptable. Alien flying saucers buried amongst ancient ruins in Peru, to me, is not. So in conclusion the movie is worth a watch but if you are a fan of the original three and are expecting a sequel mirroring the calibre of the last crusade or the temple of doom even, you'll be just as disappointed as I was.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1609,ktsixx,$$$$$$$$$$$$$ = a poor film!!!!,2,26 May 2008,"I was unsure about going to see this film originally as i wasn't sure it could be pulled off, but when thinking about Spielberg, Lucas and Ford all being a part of it, i thought it can only be good at worst.The characters were good, both old and new, and the acting was decent.I cannot believe that after 20 years, the script for this film was the best that crossed the desks of the fore mentioned.I have lost respect for Spielberg, and wish Lucas would broaden his work away from sci-fi. As for Mr Ford, i can't believe he was prepared to take out that lovely diamond earing, to shoot this film.Scripts might not come as often as they used to for Mr Ford, but to accept this script and be paid for acting the role, that I now think should have been buried 20 years ago, only makes me believe that he has sold out.At least Stallones comeback was controlled by his own penmanship.

1610,dynastydood2,There was a spaceship....,3,24 May 2008,"Wow. It may all be summed up in one slightly sarcastic albeit truthful statement: there was an alien spaceship in this movie. I greatly enjoyed the original trilogy (the third especially) even though they are of a generation before my own. However, I am truly disgusted with the blatant commercialized tone and presentation of this extreme disappointment. This film was entirely unnecessary and merely attempted to force visual references from the original trilogy down the audience's throat. Marion's character was not needed, Shia LeBeouf was essentially a marketing tool to target the younger customer, and above all the plot was more random than George Lucas tanning nude in the middle of Park Avenue in December. This series is dead, for Mr. Lucas is indeed the franchise undertaker. I don't understand how this film could have possibly received good reviews. People got up and left it was so ludicrous. As far as I'm concerned, this film does not exist. It utterly pales in comparison to the wittiness and true adventurous feel of the originals, for that's what made them great even for a modern audience. I should have seen it coming with the Burger King kids toys and the Indy hats being sold at Blockbuster. Wow, what a gross slap in the face. Here Mr Lucas, take my $11 dollars and have a tan on me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1611,craigtutton58,It could have been so much better,4,23 May 2008,"I only got into Indiana Jones when the trilogy had already been made, shortly after the Last Crusade hit the screens, so the anticipation I felt for this movie was very much new but very exciting. I've never felt so much anticipation for a movie before, and i've never been to see a movie on the day of its release because I just couldn't wait to see it, but in this case I really, honestly thought it was going to be a fantastic sequel to a fantastic movie creation. It would seem that my expectations may have been a bit too high.I'm not saying it's awful, or that it was a waste of time going to see it. But I believe it was the least creative and exciting, and above all the least 'Indiana Jones' out of all of them. I think it started well, I liked the trademark paramount logo transformation into the mud-hill, i liked the car race even though it had an Elvis track playing, i thought it brought more suspense to when that Indy theme will kick in. I think the best part though, and personally the best part in the movie, was the introduction of Indiana Jones. The music was well-crafted to fit the mood and camera shots as he was thrown from the car, and that faint build-up Indy theme when he placed on his fedora really made it a great scene, and really got me hyped up for the rest of the movie.I really liked the shot of the hangar and the resonance of the end of Raiders of the lost ark, with the raiders theme and similar lighting and look to the original shot it really made a great moment. I also liked Indy's escape through the hangar and the flash of the Ark of the covenant in it's broken box. Thing is, there wasn't much else after this point that i enjoyed.It just didn't feel very much like an Indiana Jones movie. I don't blame Spielberg or Lucas at all, i give full credit to 2 of the greatest film makers ever for creating and maintaining such an eligible franchise. I just felt a sigh of disappointment and disbelief in some parts; the fridge protection/landing from the atomic bomb, the jungle sword-fight, the monkey/shia swinging, the 3 waterfall plunge survival, the spaceship...Im not saying don't see it. Everyone should see it, and interpret it differently. Hopefully when i watch it again it will grow on me. But for now, I think that the fourth instalment to everyone's favourite hero was a let-down.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1612,sc-psyched,Hugely Watchable,10,23 May 2008,"The main reason I've elected to give this 10 instead of, say, 8 or 9, is because it kept me occupied for the entire 2 or so hours without my even looking at my watch. In most films these days I find I start wondering when it's going to end pretty early in, but I was entertained to the very last with the latest Spielberg/Lucas offering.Perhaps I enjoyed it so much is because it is most definitely an Indy film; I found for example with the new Star Wars films that they'd lost something of the feel of the originals. It's a big, bold adventure, packed with ancient artefacts and lost cities.And in true Indy style it's laced with elements of comedy and the supernatural - but this time, these are taken to the extreme and this is my only real criticism.As far as rankings go I'd put it below Raiders and the Last Crusade but above the Temple of Doom. They're all compulsively watchable however. I'm unsure whether to recommend it to Indy fans especially in case they'd be disappointed but as a fan of the series myself I think I can appreciate even more the references to the predecessors. Best new film I've seen in quite some time.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1613,FionnMatthew,"A good Indy film, which suffers from George Lucas.",7,22 May 2008,"It's good enough to sit with the older Indy movies.There were some problems, but thankfully they were NOTHING to do with Ford being ""too old."" In fact, his being older was a real treat - the stuff they've done with his character has a lot of resonance with Connery's character in THE LAST CRUSADE, and this was deliberate. This Indy is older, wiser, a little more relaxed, a little more grim, a little less ambivalent, but he's the SAME character, and the progression is logical, truthful and well carried off.In fact, the triumph of the film is that they haven't ruined this character (which Lucas has done to some of the characters from Star Wars). He's just as great and enigmatic as ever, albeit different. And this makes the film a lot of fun, despite its flaws.The flaws are really one flaw, which manifest themselves several ways. It's George Lucas. He needs to retire.For example: The conceit of the film, The Crystal Skulls, leads into the central mystery of this film - which ends up being an ""aliens lived among the Mayans and were worshiped as gods"" story. First off, it's clichéd. The inclusion of Roswell is handled well, but it's hard not to wince at what is one of the most overused mytho-plot devices in cinematic history.But the overall effect is that everything is demystified, which is the opposite effect to that of the first three movies. Instead of the unsettling mystery of the forces of the Ark, we are left with the filled-in orderliness of post-X-Files alienology, where even though we are not given an explanation for everything, everything SEEMS as if it can and could have one. And it all seems so out of place. It's certainly an Indy movie. It feels like one. But bang smack in the middle of it are bits out of ET, or Flight of the Navigator, or Close Encounters. And besides all of this it's cheesy and obvious, in a way that the first three movies just weren't.And there's the hyper-realized action sequences that Lucas has become so fond of. One of the lovely things about the first three films, and also about the original Star Wars trilogy, is that there was a sense of what was possible, and what was not: a context which made certain feats really cool or amazing, such as when Indy levered himself under the truck in the RAIDERS. Indy was forever getting hurt, or almost not making it, and we had an appreciation for the possibility of what he was doing. The knocks and jerks he experienced while doing things gave us a nice tactile feedback on that intuition.And certain scenes really have that. The scene where Indy and Mutt flee on a motorcycle, or the scene where Spoiler: they go over the waterfalls, or the scene with the ants: these all have the feel of those scenes - they're not completely unbelievable - they're just wild.But remember the pod-racing on Tatooine in Episode 1? Or the vehicle-jumping on Coruscant in Episode 2? Remember how things happened so impossibly fast that the abilities of the characters were completely unbelievable, and the sense of reality and risk that makes a good action sequence really spectacular was completely lost in them. When a hero becomes too powerful, his every action becomes banal. CG characters can do just about anything. There's little enough exciting about watching them do it.Well, sadly, Lucas has gotten his claws into certain action sequences here. Namely, Indy surviving a direct atomic bomb hit by getting inside a lead lined fridge, and being thrown several kilometres and also a too fast, too spectacular jungle-side jeep fight, involving three vehicles, and superhuman fencing abilities by Mutt, which is very reminiscent of the banality of the pod-racing or vehicle hopping of the Star Wars Prequels, and a sequence where Mutt vine-swings in order to catch up to the racing vehicles, which feels like a ""young Anakinism"" and destroys the credibility of the action. Later, the scene where the Mayan city is swallowed up looks great, but is also too huge for an Indy movie to contain. There's too much going on here. It's too operatic for this franchise, which grew out of matinée adventures. It has the feel of the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie, too - where the scale of the thing got out of hand, and the spirit of the picture was lost for a second.But for all that, the film is not ruined. TEMPLE, for me, was not great in terms of plot, structure, or subject matter, and yet INDY made it good, and the certain Indy tropes. I think that this film is much more the quintessential INDY film than TEMPLE, actually, and the classic touches, probably courtesy more of Spielberg/Ford than of Lucas, really carry the Lucasian hysterics. Like, for instance, the Spoiler: perfect physical comedy in the milkshake bar, where Mutt provokes a fight between the Jocks and Greasers as a diversion, or the really great crypt scenes, the intriguing new creepy-crawly set pieces, the return of the lovely Karen Allen, the welcome addition of Broadbent, who fits right in, the return to the university campus, little references to the old movies (and to Han Solo - see if you can spot it!) and overall the excellent handling of Indy's character, where we see believable, humorous and poignant changes, but we also see the same man, with the same charisma and sense of humour.I had a lot of fun watching this movie. It's no LAST CRUSADE, but it holds its own against TEMPLE, I think, and more than makes up for its weaknesses. It could have been even better, though, if they'd only tied the old fool, Lucas, down.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1614,slashandthrash-1,incredibly disappointing,4,22 May 2008,"I wanted so badly to enjoy this film, and out of the entire running time i really did enjoy about 40 minutes of it.It had great exploration, some decent action scenes, and Harrison Ford did an awesome job of reprising his role as Indiana despite his age, making Indy older and wiser but still just as kickass as he's always been.However, aside from this, the film fell flat. Casting Shia LeBouf was a terrible mistake. The character of Mutt was a good idea, but the role could have been better cast in my opinion.The film takes some really large leaps into territory that fans of the series probably are not going to like very much. The Russians were great, the quest was enjoyable (save for a few action scenes that had me burying my face in my palms in embarrassment, mostly all of them involving Shia), but the finale is where the movie turns into a self destructive mess.The huge fault of this movie is the incredibly lame CGI finale. CGI kills most movies, period.****SPOILERS**** the movie would even have been great if the alien skeletons never combined. the combining of the skeletons into one live alien was the final nail in the coffin. The CGI was terrible and I felt like I was watching ReBoot or some other computer animated kids show. completely unnecessary.*******END SPOILERS******overall, its an OK movie to just go and mindlessly enjoy, but if you're a real Indy fan consider the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a spit in the face.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1615,m_haeri,Way better than its ancestors...,8,8 November 2008,"I think this movie was great and the visual effects, the plot line, the characters and direction was way better than previous sets. Its not that people always expect more from a sequel, some people cannot let new things come to their mind, if they see a movie and shape the characters and the story in their mind they cannot let new ones come trough. Thats what if you take a look to the users rating you will this movie gets the wroth one, it really doesn't deserve this. I know Lucas and Spielberg got somehow fictional in this story and this against previous installments of Indiana Jones which goes deep in the ancient world, but we cannot destroy the whole movie and overlook the greatness of Cate Blanchet and Ford performance because a spaceship comes out of the ground and goes to fourth dimension of another space.Totally the movie lacks some of the basics of original Indiana Jones but in lots of other aspects it beats them.If you enjoyed previous Indies and have an open mind to accept new ideas you will certainly enjoy this one.

Oh wait, you've screwed them BOTH already.It had maybe 1 or 2 redeeming factors, but boy did it suck a big one. I've never seen a more inconsistent movie in my life - good scene, terrible scene, good scene, ridiculous scene, bad scene, tedious scene, the ""wait, I've seen this 3 times in this movie already"" scene, the even more tedious scene, a decent scene...Not to mention the fact it was the most formulaic, cookie-cutter movie I have ever seen.

1617,aubin306,"Starts strong and then, thats it",4,27 May 2008,"While waiting to see this movie I tried to tell myself not to be disappointed and to give this film a chance, yes everythings a bit older and the title sounds stupid but hey it still might be entertaining. The first 30min or so of this movie is great. i though it was great to bring back the warehouse and the chase scene was good. Even the nuclear blast was cool, but after that it all goes downhill. What i always like about the Indiana Jones movies (which came out before i was even born) was that they were realistic. The action wasn't over done, the fights were just flat out punching biting and head butting, and even though you may or may not believe in the grail or the ark the movies made you believe that they could and to stay the heck away from them if you do. I get the whole alien thing its clever cause that was heavy in the 50s but I think they went to far, 3 waterfalls, come on. Harrison Ford wasn't in it enough, Shia was surprisingly good, as was his character (no overkill), and Blanchett played the evil Russian lady well.

1618,divpip,Really? That's what you spent 20 years doing?,5,22 May 2008,"The moment the first sensual blast of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull reached my quivering body, I felt a brief stab of disappointment. There I was expecting some classic Raiders style silhouette opening, putting Indy right back where he belongs in the search for some minor lost artefact before the main feature; instead I got Elvis Presley. Okay, so I get it - Lucas and Spielberg want us to know straightaway that we're no longer in the 30's. Fair enough, that's something I could have brushed off. But for a lengthy opening sequence during which we followed a quartet of young lovers, screaming 50's from their car to their clothes to their hair, which didn't even feature Jones himself - the film started pretty badly. One whip crack could have done it. The shadow of a fedora. But no - nothing. What's more - bland titles, and nothing remotely John Williams-esquire. Was a blast of the main theme and a red-yellow gradient, bubble-written INDIANA JONES title too much to ask? Evidently.Without giving away too many spoilers, I wouldn't be able to do justice to this film. As the convoy of military vehicles pulled into Area 51, I winced slightly. Indy's seen supernatural before - the Ark that could melt faces, a mystical chalice and a walkway hidden in stone - but the suggestion of aliens? Surely not. I remembered who I was dealing with, the greatest pair of creative minds in history, and felt comforted that Indy would not be making encounters of the third (or perhaps higher) kind...Instead, he was up against Cate Blanchette with a dodgy haircut and a cringe-worthy ""Ukrainian"" accent (which slipped up every time she tried to say 'Jones', something that occurred all too often). Equally Ray Winstone brought nothing to the film other than needless confusion and a pack of poorly-written, poorly-delivered lines. La Boeuf, one saving grace, possibly shone brighter than Ford himself who, while stepping back into the shoes of Indiana Jones nicely, had matured perhaps a little too much. Arguably the most pleasant casting call was that of Jim Broadbent, a perfect replacement for the Marcus Broady figure.Despite my complaining, there were certain fields where the film excelled itself. The stunts were as ever sterling (if perhaps overplayed); the score almost made me feel back at home; and the cinematography, costume and sets were by-and-large stunning. By half-time though, the evidence of an extra-terrestrial conclusion was mounting. A mysterious box with a Roswell stamp; a lengthy skull with pointed eyes made of some unearthly composite; suggestions of supreme knowledge well before its time... The film gets a 5 on the basis that it was mostly entertaining. There were moments that made my heart melt slightly: a perfect, self collapsing stone mechanisms; some classic father-son dialogue about college; a reminder of Indy's fear of snakes. All in all however, I felt perhaps the crew's efforts to remind us that this was still Indiana Jones might have taken up too much of their attention, leaving much to be desired from the weaker dialogue, most of the acting, and the plot, which (as I hid my face in hands and began to sob) boldly went where no Jones had ever gone before, and God willing, will never go again. Top 10 Moments to look-out for: 1) Shia la Boeuf's Tarzan impression; 2) The ugliest vicar in the history of time; 3) John Hurt being used to full potential (you won't spot this one); 4) All the reminders that Sean Connery didn't want to be a part of the film; 5) Indiana Jones surviving a pointless nuclear bomb blast in an apparently- cushioned, seatbelt-fitted fridge; 6) The Jones family plus riding the Niagra Fall of log flumes with relatively mild discomfort; 7) One too many references to the Jones family tree; 8) The hybrid car-boat with mounted machine gun that refuses to budge an inch, regardless of how many times Cate Blanchette and her unnamed stooge ram it; 9) All the CG monkeys, ants and ruddy, ruddy gophers, and... 10) The spaceship that rises out of the ground right at the end. You think I'm kidding...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1619,navdev,The final evolution of Indiana Jones,10,23 May 2008,"There is an extremely touching line towards the end of 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' that says 'So much time is wasted waiting'. While this is in regards to Indiana's own personal journey through the course of all four films it also echoes Steven Spielberg's, George Lucas' and Harrison Ford's endurance over 19 years in making this film. And indeed - this is an amazing film worth waiting for.'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' is not simply a good Indiana Jones film; it is a very good film. It demonstrates such a marvellous amalgamated homage to the different film genres of the 60s along with developing the key character of Indiana Jones. More importantly as the film begins we realise just how alone Indiana is after all, and as the film progress he is blessed with an encounter with a particular familiar face which enables him to embrace that wasted time. It is a beautiful completion to an iconic character that the world holds dear.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It was as if I was watching a ""Die Hard"" or ""Mission Impossible"" movie. However, maybe this was supposed to be one of those poor comedies because throughout the whole movie I was laughing at the silliness of the film's creators. I know it's easy to ruin a great succession of movies like the previous three about Indi, but to do it on such a scale, well, that requires a great skill. Now, back to the movie, so I can comment on the thing that was most amusing to me. The communists were made to look like some stupid and crazy people, who couldn't prevent Indi and his fellows from escaping any time they wanted to do so. Finally, the greatest idea of the movie was that even the aliens hate those ""damn communists"" and kill them.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The spirit was there, the actors were having fun, and I've been a fan of Indy since the day I was born. I loved it. My friend loved it. The people in the movie theater loved it. Cate Blanchett rocked the Russian accent and kicked some major ass. It was also nice to see Karen Allen again, and Harrison's Indy was just unchanged. Yeah, he's old, and I think Lucas realizes there are going to be no more Indy movies. But, I thought it was an awesome send-off. Don't down on it.

1623,foxfire12,A great movie...for some,7,23 May 2008,"This movie will entice a lot of viewers to immediately leap up and say ""it was terrible!"" Why? Well, Indy is Indy. He can still kick butt and be the hero. It's still got action and great fight scenes. It even has a lot of humor, which lightens the mood nicely. However, as so many people here have already commented, the movie is going to upset a lot of people. I'm a young fan compared to many die hard ones, but I understand where those ""older"" fans are coming from.The issues revolve mainly around the Sci-Fi elements (especially at the end), the CGI effects and the fact it was ""lacking"" a certain ""Indiana Jones"" feeling to it. You have to remember! Indiana Jones is classified as supernatural and science fiction! It isn't just action/adventure! The alien bit may be pushing it a bit (I think the ending was a bit trippy myself) but it isn't breaking any story laws here. The crystal skull legends DO include aliens as a ""theory,"" even as a crackpot one. They didn't just make it up randomly. As for the CGI, that would be Lucas' and Spielberg's creative choice, not the fans'. The places that I saw any real CGI were in the very beginning (Prairie dogs?) and at the very end. It really wasn't as bad as it seemed. Also, as for the Indiana Jones ""feeling,"" I felt perfectly fine with it. The acting is a bit different as well as the flow of the plot, but hey, THIS IS TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE LAST ONE. People change, peoples' minds change...everything changes. Actors adapt their skills and movie makers have different styles. Any movies made now or later will NOT be mirror each other exactly because of the time gap. There's no use complaining about it. It can't be helped.As for my opinion, the movie was great. It wasn't perfect, but it was still fun to watch and Indy was still Indiana Jones. I really enjoyed Mutt's character and I can't WAIT to see them interact more, if they do make more movies.For older fans, I can only say bite the bullet and accept that times have changed. Go ahead and see it anyway. Who knows? You might be surprised.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I chose later on to see the film again, just to make sure my opinion wasn't blurred by the hour and amount time I had been awake, I was less confused, less tired, but still disappointed.""How could they do this to us?"" I thought. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are master craftsman, how could they deliver this thin story with poor effects. After the Star Wars prequel fiasco I was a little worried about George's involvement, but he was the producer and I falsely believed that Steven could avoid his movie killing grip.I could go on about the bad, but me being me and that I would never let a saga go incomplete in my movie collection, so I purchased the BLU-RAY version. That is where that genius of this film is revealed, gone was the confused and disappointed feeling. I realized unlike the other films which endured because of their playability in a movie theatre, this film plays better at home. I enjoyed this film and I dare say it is the best BLU-RAY in my collection. I came to the conclusion, in the theatre I was on ""information overload"" too much new information, in a world most of us know thru and thru. However at home I was able to take it all in. pause and rewind if need be.This movie is great and in ten years it will receive it's due.Steven, George, good work.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1625,maxipad505,so stupid it's no longer entertaining,1,25 May 2008,"The biggest problem with this movie isn't that it's stupid, because i can go to a movie and enjoy it if there are good action sequences and it's fun to watch. The problem i have with this movie is that it's so stupid that it's impossible to even delude yourself into taking it at face value and enjoying it. It literally brings retarded to new levels. I feel as though Spielberg took the respect i have for him and shot it point blank. He's gonna have to turn out another Schindler's list or something real quick or he's dead to me as a director. I had read somewhere that part of the reason this film took 19 years to come out was that they were searching for the best storyline possible. And after seeing this piece of garbage, i'm absolutely astounded by the stupidity of that. The script has more plot holes then a piece of swiss cheese, and so much of it is just so far off from the physical realm of reality, i feel as though it's insulting to the intelligence of the American people. For example, you can't survive a nuclear blast by hiding inside a refrigerator, and you can't stop a magnetic field's pull by putting a Pancho over it. You could hear Sir Issac Newton turning angrily in his grave the entire movie. And these errors were so huge i honestly couldn't see past them. In short this movie is a piece of crap and you'd be doing the film industry an enormous disservice by patronizing it with your 8 dollars.Also, casting Shia LaBeouf as a tough guy was such a poor decision, but characteristic of this movie as a whole.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1626,mattroffe,Like watching your grandma die.. but with a good theme tune.,2,23 May 2008,"Indiana Jones..an icon, anyone over the age of 30 will remember the first 3 movies first time around and more than likely millions more since have fallen for the great adventure, the cliffhanger peril and the lovable charm of indiana jones and his many adventures. Those who waited so patiently for this 4th installment like myself have probably been counting the days until our hero returned to the screen with his dry humour dogged determination and unstoppable passion for finding the worlds most wanted treasures. What a crying shame then that our famous whip cracking icon finds himself in a world of CGI, lost in a pointless plot with depth-less characters chasing an artifact that quite frankly looks like its made of plastic and stuffed with cling film.. Personally this is the movie disappointment of the decade. This movie seems to be more aimed at new viewers that know nothing of indiana jones. The insane amount of CGI, the pointless situations our main character finds himself in seem to be more out of an excuse to just add another action sequence rather than adding to the story. Typical of recent movies. Those newcomers will no doubt be lost by what would have been a welcome return or Marion Ravenwood. But for us old timers what ruined this was the stupidity of what both indy and Marion could achieve. Yes Indy has always been a stretch of the imagination but in the past it has been believable, the characters had a sense of oooo i might just die doing this.. not anymore. Diving off cliffs in a car, surviving a nuclear bomb.. its just stupid..Worst of all was the utterly pointless and meaningless plot. Like someone else mentioned it took minutes before to know our hero's goal. The Ark, The Grail, who honestly who has seen this film gives a monkeys about the plastic cling film filled skull. If we wanted aliens we would watch the utter tosh that is AVP... Even poor Harrison Ford couldn't save this movie from sinking into the pits of one of the worst sequels ever made. Given that it was made again with Lucas and Spielberg in the saddle i am dumbfounded and what they have produced.If they plan a 5th. please save indy from this criminal insult to the series.If you are 8 go watch it. If you are an Indy fan do yourself a favour and remember the good old days for what they were. this was like watching your grandma die of cancer with only one plus.. the theme tune.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1627,rick-900,What a waste of a perfect opportunity...and Harrison Ford,1,23 May 2008,"I really can't understand how people and critics can give this movie more than one star. In my opinion, it was awful-absolutely terrible-such a complete disappointment. I am a huge fan of the original Indy film-Raiders of the Lost Ark (I was 12 when it came out in the 80's and what a phenomenon it was) and this one isn't even close to being in the same league-shouldn't even be associated with the original.Firstly, the premise or ""McGuffin"" has no business being associated with the character of Indiana Jones; number 1. The whole allure to this character is archeology-the search for ancient artifacts tied to religion or the occult bearing the mysterious and possibly the supernatural; (SPOILER DON""T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON""T WANT TO BE GIVEN A HUGE HINT)not Star Wars. Number 2; yes, there were unbelievable elements to raiders i.e., his paper thin escapes, etc. but they were all palatable in Raiders. We could all swallow it. In this one you couldn't swallow any of it. It was so utterly far-fetched and unbelievable that it was borderline insulting. Also, Raiders was an action drama adventure with elements of comedy ingeniously placed throughout. The journey was the adventure and the climax was spectacular-well worth the journey. This one is more attempting at comedy-no dramatic elements and the adventure or journey was ridiculous. This is not even worthy of being called a comedy either. The jokes were corny, dialog absurd. This was more of a mockery. Everything within it was was incredibly forced; contrived.The side characters were a joke including the main villain and the ""traitor"". Not believable at all. And what was most disappointing was the unreal mockery they made of the reunion between Marion and Indiana. It was hard to even watch. And the Mutt character was unbearable, especially when he goes from a grossly stereotypical and utterly clichéd ""50's Greaser"" to expert fencing artist and ""TARZAN?!?!"" It was laughable. I felt myself wanting to leave the theater several times. It was like watching a train wreck but instead of feeling sad-you feel angry at what a slap in the face this movie was.So to sum it up this installment (which again shouldn't even be associated with ""Raiders"")was terrible; a mockery of one of the best movies in film history. Not only is it the worst of the series but quite possibly the worst Spielberg film ever. I'd watch ""1941"" a million times before ever seeing this garbage. It is such an incredible shame that pride (with Lucas) got in the way seizing a perfect opportunity to reinvent and further perfect (i.e. like James Bond-no wonder it has had such longevity) an excellent fictional hero. He should have listened to those around him about this ridiculous McGuffin; he should have more seriously considered the Fran Darabount or M. Night Shaymalan scripts. Harrison Ford's age had nothing at all to do with it. He did the best he could with the shabby material. I hope I am in as good shape when I am his age. What a let down.

1628,liveatfivemail,Indiana's 'Skull' Sequel the worst ever!,1,12 April 2009,"This movie was just awful, it's very sad to see how Spielberg along with Lucas have simply sold out to the wonderful world of Disney. This latest Indiana film is not only laughable, it's one of the most poorly edited action-style films I have ever seen. By the way, bringing back Karen Allen was a mistake...on her own behalf. Her acting was best left for her remaining retirement years. The director didn't help her either especially when we see her sitting on the ground holding nothing but a steering-wheel. Was I watching Indian Jones or the Roadrunner hour? To think how impressed I was the day I first saw 'Raiders' in 1981. From the first jungle scene, thru the excavating scenes in the desert, I felt like I could conquer the world with a whip and a hat. 27 years later, I'm watching something short of a 'Play Station' game, way short.Sorry I even saw it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It started out great, and it has a few good action sequences, but it is so far removed from what Indiana Jones used to be like. Two things that should reveal to any and everyone how bad this movie is.....and don't worry, neither of these gives anything away (I put spoiler alert simply because the second one may be considered a spoiler, though the information was in the New York Times):1) A scene in which Shia Labeouf's character swings on vines through the Amazon with a group of monkeys and 2) George Lucas originally wanted the movie to be called ""Indiana Jones and the Space Invaders from Mars""Just a big disappointment.

I loved the trilogy because each movie was so unique and different from anything in Hollywood. But when I saw ""Kingdom,"" I was truly disappointed. ""Kingdom"" used every cliché in the book. Here are some examples. 1. The magical artifact repels danger. (bugs, natives, etc...) 2. The good guys barely escape from the Russians, right when you think they are safe, the Russians find them again. It happened 3 times. The third time was the ULTIMATE cliché. Once again you think they are safe, they have the skull, they're in the room, but the Russians come and take it. She puts the skull on. All the Russians end up dying. 3. In a river, ""OH NO!!! A WATER FALL!"" They fall. Even though they fell two more times which made it a little less predictable, it made it more unbelievable. 4. How many times have you seen a movie where the main character finds out he has a son (who is normally a supporting character? Okay, I guess I can deal with clichés. What about predictability? I was practically mouthing out the words while watching ""kingdom"" because it was that predictable. The second I heard Mutt say he was good with a knife, I knew he would fight Cate Blanchet. At Comic-Con there was a video shown where spieldberg said ""I'm making this movie for you guys. The last three were written the way I wanted. You deserve this."" Perhaps his taste in movies is a lot better than ""ours."" Me being an animator, I was able to point out so many graphics flaws. But at least it's a step up from the previous movie's graphics right? Maybe so, but since technology has changed so much since ""The Last Crusade,"" I felt like Spieldberg and Lucas used effects as an excuse for a bad story-line. Of course I will buy this movie, come on, it's still Indiana Jones. A lot of people didn't like the new Star Wars movies because they were so different from the original.

1631,leoj1234,Overrall a good movie,9,30 May 2008,"I was not yet alive when the first 3 movies came out but I have since watched them a lot and enjoyed and enjoyed them tremendously. I'll agree with most people: Temple of Doom was the darker and Raiders was arguably the best. I was filled with anticipation as I walked into the theater to see this movie, I had already read reviews on here and wanted to see for myself. You have your many folks that enjoyed this and some that didn't. I thought it was an excellent movie, arguably surpassing The Last Crusade, definitely passing ToD and ranking up there with Raiders. One thing is certain in my opinion: Indys' still got it, the acting was tremendous from everybody. But I was somewhat confused about the whole alien plot and the only part that aggravated me was the ""flying saucer"" rising from the ground at the end. Then I realized..hey..this is not longer 1930's Indy its 1950's. And I've been told in this time period this whole space thing was a big ordeal..and if Lucas was setting out to make it that way, then I applaud him...I also enjoyed the ""I have a bad feeling about this line"". It all depends upon a matter of perception: the reality of it is this movie is doing great at the box office and pleases many people, for those of you that are to stuck in the past to enjoy this, going into the theater with a ""how bad is this going to be compared to the other ones"" attitude, then I can see why you wouldn't enjoy this film, I personally thought it was great. 9/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This film just crosses the boundary of unbelievable/entertaining to unbelievable/ridiculous. Aliens? REALLY?! I felt pretty disgusted after watching this movie. It basically spit on history and archeology. 2) Shia?! I personally don't like him, and I find his personality pretty annoying...but that's just my opinion.

1633,bcalum2000,One of the worst movies my skull has ever seen,2,25 May 2008,"I gave it two more stars than it deserves simply because of Indy's hat and John Williams's score. To be fair, there are places - especially in the first half - that made me smile and laugh. But there were many more that made me cringe and laugh for a different reason entirely.Let's start with Sean Connery's character being dead. What was all that eternal life nonsense we heard about (and saw) at the end of the last film? Realism was never a part of any Indiana Jones films. But COME ON. Give the audience some credit! I don't understand the point of the first little race with the Elvis music. After that, there's a nuclear blast (but the fridge is fine... OK, I'll take that for now.) The jungle chase? Straddling two jeeps during a sword fight (hey Mom, slow the damn jeep down a little maybe), and then swinging on vines like Tarzan to catch up to the speeding vehicles... I actually feel insulted by Lucas (uh, again). Sometimes less is more. Certainly here it would have been.While we're at it, what was the point of adding the FBI story in? They weren't used ever again after the beginning. Or the motorcycle greaser persona, for that matter? None of this even speaks to the ""been there, done that"" and Indy's stupidity for trusting a confessed traitor who just moments before was holding a gun to his head.Harrison acts well enough and at times flashes his old demeanor, but it seemed to me that his constant monotone was much drier and more boring than ever before.The plot was ludicrous, there was absolutely no attempt at a riddle (hey, at least Crusade TRIED, even if they were incredibly lame), the jokes were tired, and mostly I felt insulted. I understand that summer blockbusters are supposed to be mindless fun. But there should be some element of believability within the universe the film creates... right? Ending it the way they did with him taking the hat back was almost as good as and-then-he-woke-up. OK, I admit the ""I have a bad feeling about this"" was a fun shout-out to Star Wars, just as the scene at Area 51 had several subtle LOST references (and there's one Spaceballs line in there too, about not doing it for money... doing it for a $$$$load of money!""). And in the end, I'm glad I saw it, because hey, it's Indy.

1634,Sompeetalay,Indy's back !,10,21 May 2008,"Since I've always been a fan of Indiana Jones as well, I went to a midnight screening yesterday in Belgium. The movie did deliver what I expected it to be.Since Lucas and Spielberg did everything to keep the story under wraps this time, I won't tell you any big spoilers. And rest assured, there will be a couple of surprises left for you. We all know Indy will be looking for the Crystal Skull but the Kingdom is just as exciting and legendary as the McGuffin itself. The story is interesting and takes us to some of the most typical Indiana Jones locations.The story takes place in 1957 during the Cold War. It feels a bit funny so see Indy walking between souped-up 'American Graffiti' cars (he might even bump into Bob Falfa) and have him listen so Elvis songs but the fifties are so well depicted in the movie that you'll get used to it in a few moments. Nineteen years have passed since Indy found the Holy Grail and some (important) things have happened such as World War II for instance.Indy has indeed grown older. He does not only carry the mileage, he's carrying the years as well. But what can we expect? Indy is a man of flesh and blood and he grows older like anyone else. He's now 58 in the movie. Ford's jacket still fits like before and he still fights and uses the whip like in the other movies. You'll find plenty of reoccurring classical Indy aspects such as the Paramount Logo (fantastic!), the melee fight between Indy and a tall adversary, the giant heap of animals, the secretive tombs and the mystical aspect. This time it just depends in what god you truly believe like Indiana said.The other characters have their role in the movie and when you have a look at the cast, it is no surprise that they deliver very well. Shia LaBeouf is no mere sidekick and the Russians actually speak Russian most of the time. You'll get introduced to new (and old) characters but without any problem they seem to fit in the world of Indiana. The movie has some really exciting scenes and also nice inside information. When Indy talks about his past with Pancho Villa, we can see that adventure in 'The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'.So I'm really hooked up for a next screening as soon as possible. Show us your best Indiana grin and you'll enjoy this movie! Don't let the bad reviews influence you. There will always be people who look for the negative in everything. This is an absolute feel good movie. I assure you that's exactly how you will feel after watching it (again and again).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1635,darkpawt,this was brutally bad,3,1 June 2008,"I went to this under the impression that it would at least partially resemble the original trilogy. And I was right. It ""partially"" resembled it. Lucas appears to only be successful at one thing now: taking his previous work and destroying the fond memories of them with their fans, by making a sequel/prequel that disrupts the quality of all the previous work. The one thing that was good about it was that there wasn't a LOT of apparent CGI, and they used a lot of the original style. Actually, there was another good thing...yet another quality performance from Shia.The whole CGI thing with the kingdom was a bit much, really. And to summarize what they could have put on the DVD as a deleted scene, without giving out much of a spoiler, is that they could have taken out everything from the point they leave it at the end, to right after all the spinning ends. Cut that whole 5 minutes out, and the film rating would go up by 3 stars. It was acceptable, though at points DRAGGY, up to there. At that point, I rolled my eyes. Ford should have slapped Lucas with the script after reading that part. I am very glad that this was all that was left in after their ""compromise"", as I can just imagine how bad it would have been if they left in everything else.In summary, I'm not sure if I'll just pick up the original box set of the trilogy or actually wait for the 4-pack. When the trilogy box set came out, I held off buying it because of the rumor of the fourth one, and I wanted them all in one set. In hindsight, that was probably a mistake. It's debatable whether this film is worth buying or not. Maybe I'll buy the trilogy box set and wait for this one to be a single in the $4.99 bin at WalMart. :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It entertained me, but  it could've done much better. Worst in the series, but i was satisfied  and felt i had gotten my money's worth.  It would've impressed me had the dialog done anywhere near to what it  should have been at. It was like i was watching a training video  for archaeologists at times.  Entertaining, but lacked girth.

I'd read lots of bad reviews, but I really liked it. It will be interesting to see how long it takes me to stop humming the Indiana Jones theme. The special effects are excellent. Lots of fighting. There are only a few surprises, but probably the most fun was watching the characters interact with each other as the story unfolds. The fighting was good. Good sound, good photography. I thought it was interesting how they gave everything a soft, almost glowing look. I look forward to adding it to my collection.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1638,Markanator05,Indy 4....Indy Sore,6,24 May 2008,"I'll preface by saying this about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls, it was entertaining. But that's about it.This latest Jones adventure just felt like a summer action movie with no flair of flavor. To me, this new Indy movie was supposed to bring the series back to the lime light. Instead, we get George Lucas writing a script based off of Star Wars and too unrealistic and supernatural even for Indiana Jones himself.Harrison Ford is once again spot on with the role of Dr. Henry Jones but not even a semi-retired actor can save this movie. Cate Blanchett is not nearly the bad guy she is made out to be, I just feel that she's not cut out to play the role of a psycho mad Russian woman, but that's just me. Shia Lebeouf is probably the best part of the movie but even Steven Spielberg wants to make his character too 50ish and give him the ""Fonz"" persona. He is a good young actor though and he will do the series proud.We do learn that Mutt is Indy's love child with Marion Ravenwood who makes a come back in this film as well, albeit fatter and not as pretty. This sets up the next movie (if there is one) with Shia being the lead. Which would be an excellent idea.All in all, this movie was a HUGE let down due to all the CGI, stupid effects, lousing casting, and sorry story. Georgie Boy Lucas needs to stop living in space and come back down to earth. Aliens? Really, George? That was the best you could come up with?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1639,michaelscot,Loved the Movie,10,23 May 2008,I saw the new Indy film last night and I thought it was awesome. Good special effects and of course Harrison Ford as Indy. Looking at the other reviews where certain people trashed the film and called it terrible I totally disagree. I knew what to expect when I saw it and that was escapism and adventure and some good one liners from the lead stars. I would definitely go and see it again and also get the DVD when it comes out. When the movie started last night the audience cheered and clapped and that is the first time I have ever seen that at the cinema. At the end the audience also clapped so I think it went down very well indeed.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1640,sdfriars,over the top...,5,22 May 2008,"To say that I was sorely disappointed would be an understatement. I felt the same way coming out of this as i did coming out of The Phantom Menace. I was bummed out. I had many questions running through my mind. I was upset. First off, Harrison Ford was great and Shai Labouf was surprisingly good. Labouf was my biggest fear going into the movie and he turned out to be the least of my worries. Over all (with the exception of Karen Allen and her Hillary pantsuit) the acting was top-notch. No problems there. ***SPOILERS*** The plot was flimsy and the action was unbelievable and over the top. Indy gets tossed like two miles by a nuclear blast inside a 1950's lead-lined refrigerator and casually walks out? How many times could Indy and his friends get shot at point-blank by elite Russian soldiers and not even get scratched? Everything about the entire waterfall scene made me look away from the screen because it was sooo unbelievable, not to mention that they were all bone-dry and full of vitality the very next scene. The vine-swinging George of the Jungle scene? Give me a break. I was led to believe that this film was going to have very minimal CGI in it. That was a load of crap. As far as the plot goes, lame. I didn't mind the presence of aliens at all but the plot itself was flimsy at best. It had no flow to it and it seemed very forced. The ending was the epitome of anti-climatic and a bit of a cop out too. This movie could have been great. It certainly had the potential. It was kind of like listening to a great album that was just turned up way too loud.I also think that being 32 years old and growing up on the original trilogy has a major influence on my opinion. If I saw Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as a ten year old apart from the original trilogy, I'm sure that I would enjoy it more and be less critical.Last but not least, George Lucas has lost it. I'm starting to doubt if he even made A New Hope or Raiders of the Lost Ark. Everything he has done since then has gotten progressively worse. Is he the most overrated filmmaker of all time?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1641,katieellalawrence,Irina Spalko and Fragile Masculinity,4,9 April 2021,"I found Cate Blanchett's character to be tremendously empowered and I thought it was unfortunate that she was portrayed exclusively as a villain. In the Indiana Jones movie series women who disagree with or contradict Indy are considered threatening, dangerous, or even evil. However, I thought Irina Spalko's dedication to the discovery of the Crystal Skull and the attainment of more knowledge were inspiring and compelling. Her characterization as a maniac and villain are arguably a reflection of Indiana's fragile masculinity.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1642,bonnie_wright_13,Indy Reminds Me of Me,10,23 May 2008,"I saw it twice yesterday and loved it. Here are a few of my impressions. I could identify with three of the characters at various parts. I enjoyed the opening scene with the mound when they used Hound Dog with a prairie dog and then had Elvis. The mountain reminded me of Close Encounters of A Third Kind. I think Spielberg had something to do with that. Did you know that a friend of mine showed me the actual mountain that was used? Every time I see that I am reminded of who told me that. Spielberg wanted for us to have fun with the movie. I know that I sure did. I have seen it three times as of this writing. The desert street race had to have come from Lucas, since he likes that sort of thing. I was reminded of Back to the Future. Then at the diner, which was named Arnie's reminded me of how Lucas went to USC, he seems to keep on using red and yellow in his movies. Then I was reminded of Happy Days with the Fonz and then of course of Marlon Brando whom Mutt did his acting of. There are so many interesting things for me to watch for. I was three years old in 1957, so I can relate to some of the things I have seen. I remember the song on the TV and almost could sing right along, for I had heard thatThen I seemed to keep on seeing references to even the X-Files, and that new movie has not even come out yet. But of course Indy did use the X before. I was reminded of that when I saw Indy's dad in a photograph on Indy's desk. It was for a second. I wonder if it was him they were referring to with the wind? It may just have been. I remember seeing that movie with Sean back then when it first came out. Or also a hint of The Last Crusade and reference to the wind.I saw the first showing of the day yesterday, but had enough time to look in a comic book to know what was going to happen, so I really did enjoy the entire thing, so much that I watched it again, then went back to Barnes and Nobel and read more from another book. (and a few others too) And I was not even in a library either. Indy said get out of the library in that very movie (I just remembered that) I had wanted to see what Lucas was meaning about a certain part, so I did find it.""The idea was, the aliens came here hundreds of thousands of years ago and set up the human race"" Lucas says. ""Then we came up with a twist: The aliens didn't come from outer space but from another dimension. It's an anti-gravity issue to get them from dimension to dimension, or at least that's the theory. Then I combined that with the Nazca Indians. The idea was this whole cult was built around these aliens that existed in this lost city on the Amazon, which was called at one point El Dorado, the City of Gold. But the gold they were talking about is the knowledge that these aliens created the human race.""The Complete Making of Indiana Jones: The Definitive Story Behind All Four FilmsI particularly wanted to read that part carefully, then I wrote it down and wanted to share that with the board. It was around page 235 http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780345501295There is so much more treasure for me to find. I am anxious for the movie to come out on DVD so I can watch it more slowly and add my own commentary.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1643,cosmopolit76,It's almost too embarrassing to watch,3,2 July 2008,"Most of the time while watching this movie you will sit in your chair in disbelief and wonder what the once dynamic duo Spielberg/Lucas where thinking shooting this crap. My expectations of the movie were on the low side of the scale but it turned out I should have avoided seeing this at all. The whole idea with the crystal sculls/alien story is not the problem i think. The crystal sculls exist, not in alien form, but human crystal skulls were found in maya temples. And even with todays laser technology it is not possible to craft something like this (they are carved against their natural axis, what is theoretical impossible)The maya tale is that if you bring the 13 sculls together they save the world from a catastrophe taken place in 2012. (maya calender ends there) So a connection to aliens bringing the sculls to earth is not complete made up out of thin air. What's wrong with movie is the stupid over the top action and the reaction of the characters to the events. Indy and his sidekick ending their motorcycle chase in the library by sliding like 50 meters on the floor. Well, this must be happening all the time, because a student is not wondering at all, but asking Indy about some school stuff. I guess this is supposed to be funny, but sadly it's just stupid. Or Indy escaped some Russian guys in the beginning of the movie, hiding behind a rock. Do they make any effort to look for Indy? Nope. Good thing after this movie is, we now know Indy can survive anything without a scratch. The guy from ""Unbreakable"" is nothing comparing to Indy. Some scenes are so bad I was just thinking ""Please make it stop, I can't take anymore. ""Sword Fight"" scene, ""Tarzan"" Scene, ""Waterfall"" scene and the list goes on. I wonder why CGI scenes are getting worse these days and look completely unnatural, it was all looking good in the early 90's with T2 and Jurassic Park. Oh, I forgot the ""I just found an anaconda to pull Indy out of the mud"" scene. Come on... The acting was a mix, some characters were played decent, others were a joke. Ford was o.k., the old Indy charisma is gone, but he is still probably better than any other actor in this role would be. Well, there is also some good in this movie, but not a lot.Some settings were nice and brought back some of the old Indy feeling. There were some references to the old movies and some of them were funny. The same goes for some one liners. The sound and music are still a blast, it's just nice to hear the Indy theme, while seeing a plan flying over a map. This prevents the movie from giving him just one star. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1644,greg-1083,YES! Another Great Adventure From Indiana Jones,6,11 June 2008,"YES this is another great adventure from Indiana Jones.Harrison Ford is simple the greatest hero and leading man of the past 30 years and this movie cements that even at his age of 65, he still jumps, runs and punches with the same energy as the past three movies and he's joined by a new rising star in Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams who has some great action scenes as well and let me tell you the action is top notch and it's classic action with break neck set piece after set piece.The plot is classic Indy with the mystery of the Crystal Skull but with a new twist that some may like and others will not but the simple fact is they don't make movies like this anymore so go see it in the cinema while you can because it will be the greatest adventure you will go on this year.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1645,thewolfmann04,No wonder Sean Connery didn't want to return for this,1,25 May 2008,"The previews are over. The Lucasfilm logo flashes across the screen. You get excited because you are going to watch Harrison Ford (who is pushing 66 by the way) play in one of the greatest roles ever created for the last time. Your still excited even after the first scene in which Indiana Jones singled handedly taken out 2 dozen Russians, but as the movie continues you start to wonder why this movie doesn't have the same feel. You shrug it off because, ""hey, it's 2008 not the 1980's, movie-making has changed a bit and because of the fact that it's Indiana Jones, the other three haven't disappointed you, so neither will this one."" As the movie gets half way through, you start realizing that this isn't what you've been waiting to see for the last 17 years. The action is as good as you could ever imagine but the story is nothing close to what it should be. By the time the movie is over you are in anguish and disappointment because of the fact that it wasn't Harrison Ford who let you down, but it is Steven Spielberg and George Lucas who have stolen your money from you and are going to cause you to lose sleep. This movie had a lot of great qualities to it, but its flaws will lead to you the point of aggravation that you will be throwing you $8 tub of popcorn and screaming obscenities when your grandmother is sitting next to you. There are three main things that have ruined this film, and I've sure most will agree. 1) Cate Blanchett. The Oscar winner, who in my mind has never been good in a role, disappoints us yet again. Not to mention the fact that SHE is the arch villain. Seriously?? 2) The CGI (Computer Generated Imaging.) The quality and quantity is absolutely god AWFUL. 3) This is the most important of all, and one word will sum it up for anyone who is considering seeing this film, despite what anyone tell you. This movie is about...... ""Aliens"" enough said",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1646,carrolltrevor,Indy without a heart,4,24 May 2008,"I must say I love the first and third installments of the Indy films they are action films with a heart. People we care about because they come across as real people who can be hurt and who have a real relationships and pasts that matter. This film was full of action, unrealistic action sequences and run ins and info about old friends but where was the heart? Another words the first movies where about people looking for objects and the objects and action never became more important then the people in the story. Indy 4 was unsuccessful in being anything other then what my fellow movie goers said it was, just another action movie. I had hoped it would be much more then that. I own the other films I will not be purchasing this one on DVD or blue ray.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1647,tamo_one,an average film but what did we expect?,1,28 May 2008,"My basic problems with this film were several plot flow and dialogue problems. As for the acting, Harrison Ford was good and so was his son. The mother was terrible and so was Kate Blanchett as a Russian! The worst part of the movie was the car chase through the jungle. The son landed in the vines with the monkeys and then started swinging in the trees with them. At that point I had lost respect for the movie and redemption was futile. Spielberg and George Lucas should be embarrassed for some of these plot points in the movie.While this movie does not by any means rate a 1, I have been forced to give it such a low score because I think IMDb is being manipulated by the marketing companies in Hollywood who are putting in thousands of 10 votes. This is not fair because I like the IMDb rating and if this continues it will render the rating system useless. Luckily at this stage its only being done for blockbuster movies. May you make back your money investors.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1648,Megalomania22,2008 Summer Block Buster,8,23 May 2008,"The long awaited return of Indiana Jones has finally come. After a 19 year hiatus, Director Steven Spielberg resurrects the legendary hero, Indiana Jones, in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Spielberg's three previous Indiana Jones films have made over $1.3 Billion world wide. Additionally, the 1981 great-grandfather Raiders of the Lost Ark was rated # 60 on the AFI (American Film Institute) list in 1996 and #66 on the 2007 list.Harrison Ford, who has played the lead role of ""Indiana"" since the original, is joined by Indiana Jones new comer Shia LaBeouf (Mutt Williams.) (If you remember, Henry Jones Jr. took his nickname ""Indiana"" from the family dog) Karen Allen, who appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), also returns as the feisty Marion Ravenwood. Additionally, The lovely Cate Blanchett endears us with her overly-heavy Russian accent creating a formidable femme fatale in Irina Spalko. But that's not all, the renowned actor John Hurt, and the memorable Jim Broadbent also joins the cast. Certainly Spielberg has spared no expense in uniting a cast of well-seasoned, award winning actors.Previously our swashbuckling hero, Indiana Jones, has faced his arch nemesis the Nazi's in a race against time and evil. Historically, it can be no coincidence that Spielberg and Executive Producer/Writer George Lucas created a film series based upon the fight between good and evil. As I am typing this, a real race for 13 Crystal Skulls is in full swing. According to believers in the ancient Mayan calendars, the world will end on December 21, 2012. It is said that only the uniting of the 13 crystal skulls can prevent this cataclysmic event from taking place. Additionally, with another cold war seemingly on the horizon for the United States, Spielberg has replaced the Nazi enemy's with Soviets.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is no ordinary sequel; Spielberg and Lucas have mastered the art of recreating a film with fresh new dynamics while tactfully taking a trip down that memorable Indiana Jones lane. Again we have a film that contains extraordinary cinematography, heart-stopping action, and a magnetic story. In comparison to other sequel films, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull stands alone to present us a time piece that contains historical, political, and scientific value, while still supplying its viewer's with limitless entertainment and breathtaking aesthetics In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the action has moved to the middle of the Cold War, with Indiana 19 years older. The last movie was set in 1938 before WWII and this one in 1957, which nicely accounts for an older Harrison Ford. The story begins with a captured Indiana Jones being escorted to Area 51, where ten years earlier he was called in to do an archaeological examination. Though the film portrays this ""secret area"" to be in Nevada, there is clear reference to the infamous incident in Roswell, New Mexico. (If you remember, in Roswell, New Mexico, on July 7, 1947, conspiracy theorists believe the US Government retrieved and then hid an alien spacecraft that had crash-landed in a farmer's field) As the prologue moves along, Indiana Jones escapes the ""secret area"" after a huge explosion. (*wink, wink*) The depth of the adventure gains momentum as Dr. Henry Jones Jr. ""Indiana"" returns to the University where he teaches. Soon after, he is fired and meets the ""Rebel Without A Cause"" Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf). The action ensues after Mutt gives Indiana Jones a letter from his mother ""Marion Ravenwood."" Rest assured from this point forward I would only be giving away the goods on this sequential masterpiece by Spielberg and Lucas. My friends, Spielberg has crafted a cinematic magnum opus that not only revisits the vital elements of the Indiana Jones adventures; he has also included subtle overtures to his ""other"" cinematic masterpieces E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (1982) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).There is no doubt; Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is ""THE"" best film in this summer's block buster series. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford have recaptured the magic that made its 1981 predecessor AFI worthy an astounding achievement for this fourth installment of the swashbuckling adventure film series. We must cordially thank Spielberg and Lucas for creating a film that resurrects an American Icon at a time when heroes are so greatly needed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1649,rboss-2,very disappointing,4,31 May 2008,"For the record, I thought it was ****.* CGI was annoying.* Harrison Ford DID seem too old to me. The comments about his age during the movie just backed up the movie-going public's thoughts.*Cate Blanchett character (with that crap haircut) was awful. Well and truly overacted that part. Indy defenders will prob defend Cate by saying that all villains are played over the top. In past Indy movies, that is not the case. Not menacing at all, she actually looked like a foolish clown.*Karen Allen did not seem to really fit into the movie. I know she was great in Raiders, but she seemed like she was having TOO much fun. There was simply no chemistry between Harrison and Karen.*John Hurt must have thought he was acting in ""Midnight Express"" all over again. Very weird part.* The alien **** was also very weird.* The young fellow in the movie was irritating. I could see the twist involving him a MILE away, and I usually fall for twists every time.* Ending was very George Lucas-like.* I hate movies where an actor overdoes an Aussie accent.Very disappointing.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Its hard to tell which of Spielbergs newer movies is worse this one or War of the Worlds, but I guess I would rather watch this one.

1655,mattvinnacombe,Indiana Jones and the Complete Lack of Anything Even Resembling a Sensible Story,4,29 May 2008,"This year seems to have been the year of the comeback for iconic characters in movies. Sylvester Stallone very successfully brought new life into his two most prolific characters with Rocky Balboa and John Rambo. Live Free or Die Hard was a good movie but did not live up to the previously set standards of the trilogy that came before it. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a complete failure at even coming close to the magic of the earlier films and, in fact, was a very big disappointment. All involved in this film should be ashamed with the work they have done. There were mistakes throughout, very poorly written dialog and no flow or reason behind anything that happened in the entire movie. So the writing, editing and direction were not very good to say the least. Most of the acting wasn't very good either. Mr. Ford seems to have forgotten how to play a character that he used to play so effortlessly and all supporting players accept Shia LeBeouf were either horrible, forgettable, or just very boring. The music and a few specific scenes were the only things that seemed like the Indiana of old. To most people the name Spielberg is synonymous with the word blockbuster and will be so in this case but not deservedly so. How he could direct such garbage is something I will never be able to understand. George Lucas, in my mind, is the father of modern movies and modern movie technology, but did he even look at this script? My thought is he hired some kids and said ""I need a story for the new Indiana Jones movie and I want aliens, groundhogs, lots of monkeys and big explosions that have nothing to do with anything else going on in the story actually don;t write one story just write several different scenes that have no meaning and will throw them all together and make sure the dialog is awful"". When the script was turned in for review the children asked ""aren't ya even gonna read it""? Lucas replied ""as long as there are aliens, groundhogs, lots of monkeys and explosions and other nonsense that means absolutely nothing i don't need to read it"".This, much like the Star Wars prequels, was a let down but much more so. In looking back on the new trilogy of Star Wars films I realize that had we not been familiar with the original trilogy we probably would have liked them much more. In the case of this movie the only thing it has going for it is the fact that it is in the company of such great films as the original Indy flicks. If this was the first of the series I can all but assure you it would be the only. It would be considered a National Treasure rip-off, or worse, the new Mummy but with more over the top sequences and much worse lines and more wooden acting. Just be glad that this, if we're lucky, is the last of a great legendary series and not the only. Many people are saying the reason for any backlash of this movie is due to the fact that it isn't Raiders of the Lost Ark. This seems like a silly thing to say. Maybe that is why they enjoyed this mess of a film because much like their comment and opinion it was complete silliness. Obviously this is not Raiders of the Lost Ark but neither were the two other Indiana adventures and they were both well made movies with stories that had meaning and heart and a clear flowing plot. The new film had none of that. It was nice seeing Indy again but I just wish the circumstances were different.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

OK, even if we deserve this awful bomb from what we did, it killed at least 300,000 people in my country. Don't make it an entertainment!! It's disgusting!! And also, you can not survive in a few miles from the explosion (10% survival in 3 mile), even if you are a die hard Indiana Jones. It's ridiculous.

He does not know anything about an atomic bomb, and he even said that mushroom cloud looks pretty. I was shocked. I explained that is far from ""pretty"", and that kills many people at once.

Usually when they have really old and classic movies remade 20 years later it usually ends up being bad. However, this movie was actually pretty good. Now I know what the director was trying to do with this movie. With some bad CG effects such as those golfors (bad spelling) or chipmunks or whatever and the impossible stunts that could never happen. Also the really fake punching noises. He was trying to make the movie seem like it was in the past. A classic movie. Very original. Or at least that's what I think because with today's technolgy and sound effects he could've done much better than that. Anyways the movie was good and it was enteraining from beginning to end however I didn't really like it as much as the others. Something about the movie didn't get me interested.

This is why it pains me so much to only give this film a three... and that's being generous.Now, the original three films were by no means realistic, but they seem like documentaries compared to the scenarios Indy and the gang face in ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" I won't elaborate at the risk of spoiling the plot, but the terms ""arms race"" and ""Tarzan"" come to mind in describing why I nearly walked out of this film. The dialogue, never the highlights of any Lucas film, had me laughing at it, not with it, a problem I didn't have with the other films.The other films in the Indiana Jones series made due with little computer effects and used many real life stunts; most of that magic is lost with the inevitable CGI effects Spielberg and Lucas throw at the audience.The beautiful cinematography is all that is preventing me from giving ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" an even lower score. It, unfortunately, is the only part of the movie that perfectly captures the feeling of the original films.Throughout the movie, I was constantly reminded of the episode of ""South Park"" in which the kids tried to protect ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""

First off, they tried to make him funny, which really doesn't work for an ""Indiana Jones"" movie. Second, trying to tie in aliens was really a bad idea if Spielberg was trying to finish off Indiana Jones. If it wasn't an Indy movie, I would have enjoyed it much more but aliens and Dr. Jones do not mix. The only thing that reminded me of the old Indiana Jones was the action. The action in this film was smart and actions are the only good time to make a funny. There are some classic Indy scenes that I enjoyed too such as the grave-robbing scene and inside the final pyramid.Overall, it was a good film, but it left me empty and wanting the old Indiana Jones...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1661,arachnophobic,"Well, what'd you expect?",7,1 June 2008,"Well, having finally convinced myself to see this movie, I must admit that I don't understand all the 1-star ratings. OK, so it's not Raiders, but if anyone was seriously expecting it to be, they might want to get a CAT-scan and drop the frequent acid-trips. This is not a bad Indy-film, and in my honest opinion it is superiour to Temple of Doom, if not by a lot, then at least by a few inches. Yes, it might seem extraordinarily far-fetched, but as someone else commented, all the films are ludicrous, and to me extra-dimensional beings are a tad more realistic than The Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail, not to mention all the heart-pulling-out from ToD. KotCS, while not the timeless classic that Raiders is and will always be, is a solid movie, that made the one blunder of trying to live up to its predecessors - the stunts are far fetched, as is the plot, but that's what I love about the Indy-films. They don't take themselves too seriously. A lot of people are comparing it to the Star Wars prequels in terms of suckiness which it does not in any way deserve. If Lucas fecked up royally with Eps. one, two and three, he might not be back on the right track with Indy 4, but at least he seems to want to get there. While we are all missing Brody in this picture, I really liked John Hurt who came along rather unexpectedly, I made certain not to read any spoilers before watching the film, Shia LaBeouf did well as the young and spunky sidekick, Kate Blanchett never disappoints, it was nice seeing Karen Allen returning as Marion and Ford is impeccable as always. I even like the ""old-couple-chemistry"" between Ford and Allen.The major drawbacks are the somewhat convoluted story and the immense hype. Also, I thought some of the fighting-scenes looked a bit sloppy, with Ford looking more like he was sparring than kicking arse, but his age taken into consideration, he did extremely well in the stunt-department.So, to summarise: A good movie, worthy of the admission-price, but not Raiders. Entertaining, funny and very much Indiana Jones. 7/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1662,labxrat92,If your an Indie fan DO NOT WATCH,5,22 May 2008,"George Lucas.... Master of the trilogy, he should of stayed that way.The new Indiana Jones has yet again showed us that George Lucas must never again be allowed behind a pen ever again. When comparing the story/ script to earlier films by Lucas this completely mediocre. Gone are the witty one liners, gone are Indie's sceptic attitude, and gone is a story that even rouses an eyebrow. As far as I am concerned Indiana Jones died after leaving the sanctuary of the holy grail On the direction of the film, it does have some incredible action, Mutt's sword fight comes to mind. Spielberg not at his best but still way above average.In conclusion, watch this film if you are willing to be disappointed if you're an idie fan, if not you'll probably have a good time. I myself hated this film, and have decided never again to watch a George Lucas film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1663,LightningLad,The Ark Knight Returns,9,12 June 2008,"SOME SPOILERS, DETAILS OF SCENES DESCRIBED ""There's always a space between, in popular songs and grade B movies""  Dr. Benway speaking in The Naked Lunch by William Burroughs A compelling adventure tale about a hero approaching his last days, past his prime and his time but nevertheless through trials finding his place in the world. Just as the previous movies of two decades ago mixed in many themes from films, serials, pulp novels and comics strips of the thirties and forties and matched them with real world events, so does this film contain real world reference and cultural themes matched with high-flying adventure, ""the stuff that dreams are made of."" The original movies highlighted how the seemingly trivial matinée heroes of early film were a young culture's clumsy but genuine mythical figures. With their superhuman abilities they conquered some of the apparent and some of the almost-subliminal fears of an America in its innocence. Since it is now 1957 for the aging Indiana Jones, later on the American scene, the themes of fifties culture  atomic apocalyptic fear, television, the miraculous kitchen appliances of commercials, cold war communist paranoia, suburbs, the nuclear family, flying saucers, spacemen, rock and roll - all find their place in Jones' dreamlike cinematic landscape. He may not have a place here, as hauntingly illustrated in the now infamous nuclear blast site scene.As befits heroic epic, especially one based on primitive storytelling forms, the human drama is all in bold strokes. It is the tests the hero faces that mirror our true struggles in life. Like in the other films, like the serials themselves, the plot is very simple, with a couple of objects being sought and possession of at least one of the objects reversed several times between the heroes and the villains. There is a chase, and this one is done very well. It is not done to outdo the previous movies' chase, nor is it a by rote retreading. It contains many clever moments as Jones and his party fight members of the Red Army only to come to a stop upon a giant hill full of red army ants, rendered in very lifelike CGI with maybe a 5% unreality gap. Since the scene as it plays out would have been impossible without CGI, the use of this technology that is barely out of the stage that animatronics were in circa the original King Kong, is eminently forgivable. For one of the first times I can remember, the characters seem to actually occupy physical space with the computer creations. The CGI will likely one day make this film look as dated as its influences do to us now, but this may actually give it more poignancy. We'll see. I really say that on behalf of those more critical of effects because for myself, if I am into a story, I really don't care. If I'm not into a story, effects don't make a difference one way or the other. In this case I was very into it. There is a moment of sublime irony as Cate Blanchett's Colonel Spalko, who elsewhere in the film, in true movie-Red form, expresses admiration for creatures with a hive mind, is almost done in by the ants acting as a group.Direction and cinematography, strangely for a movie partly based on light entertainment, is the most mature and layered I have seen yet from Spielberg and his faithfuls. Many of the angles and the way they are lit evoke the feel of classic films without being direct rip-offs; in fact in comparison some parts of Raiders of the Lost Ark look almost embarrassingly derivative. But they were younger then. When you are young, you are enthusiastic to be like your heroes.The key enjoyment here comes from star Harrison Ford, who put on his hat to once again evoke one of his heroic signature roles. Again this is more mature and individual, there are not the obvious nods to Bogart and Wayne of the earlier movies. He plays an older and wiser Professor Jones, who with time has become more pedantic, more rambling yet even more seasoned, more resourceful, and usually less excitable than in his younger years. The movie completes the picture of this character that is partly wish fulfillment and partly a flesh and blood human complete with some of the foibles and vulnerabilities of ourselves. Ford tackles it with gusto, throwing in his trademark references to reality that made characters like Han Solo seem so dimensional long ago. For instance, in the first scene he has been captured by the Russians and carried in the trunk of a car from somewhere in Mexico into Nevada. And so, for the entire opening scene, Jones' voice is weaker than it will be later, like a man who is very thirsty. And yes, it reminds us that he is older, even as the voice's growing power as the film develops shows how he is gathering his strength for what may be one last grand adventure. It is this sort of attention to detail that has helped Ford make a career of selling fantasies. It is a fantasy world with certain laws like our own world, the real world around us. Some laws can be broken; others are irrevocable  such as the passage of time and its effects.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1665,redsox9,Indiana Jones delivers!,7,24 May 2008,"What is the matter with people these days? I found this movie truly enjoyable considering how critical I am about films. Plot is far fetched? It moves to slow? Unbelievable. This film was a true breath of fresh air from all the spin offs that we have been smothered with since Indiana was first set upon us from the same creators as ""Crystal Skull"". Entertaining to say the least this film is full of nostalgia from great films long ago and cinematically spectacular. Never have I seen a film that had nailed the feel the original Indy series has bestowed upon us. Spielberg has truly shined here. Harrison Ford is at his best and Shia leaves nothing to be desired as Mutt Williams. Even the Banter between Indy and Marion hearkens back to what many of the cheap copies of Indys wake severely lack. Let's be 15 or 16 for once and enjoy what the movie experience really is about. Fun. We can throw caution to the wind here, the movie is well done. How far fetched can aliens be if the original Indy had God in a box?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

George, please do us a favor and stick to special effects and STAY AWAY from writing! Just as he created the ridiculous follow ups to the classic Star Wars series, he has taken Indian Jones series and made a mess. It is rare that I can sum up a movie in one word -- this movie was simply ""dumb."" The original films always had a sense of a ""wink"" to the audience which made for fun within the action but this film was absurd comedy that at times even became pure parody.

If you don't like having your intelligence insulted and require substance, good story lines and characters with depth, you will hate this piece of crap. All I've been hearing is, ""Well, it's not SUPPOSED to be 100% REALISTIC."" and ""There were implausible scenes in the first movie too!"" These are the folks that just don't GET IT. There's a BIG difference between a giant rolling boulder coming down on Indy and a kid dressed like Fonzie swinging through the jungle like Tarzan with help from his little forest monkeys... God, I can't even finish that thought, it's so distressing. The fact that this is the best Lucas & Spielberg had to offer is borderline offensive. This movie should be rated G.

That said, I was pleasantly surprised at Indy's latest outing. This particular film has our hero searching South America for the lost city of Akator to return the titular Crystal Skull. I myself would have preferred that the artifacts origins were less ridiculous but it is a perfectly forgivable mistake once the action starts. Kudos to Ford for kicking more ass than action stars a quarter of his age. This paragraph is probably going to be the one that puts me in friction with most of the other people on this board. I really don't care. I thought the action scenes were very well choreographed and despite the general consensus, I didn't think the CGI was overdone at all.Maybe it's just me, but I didn't feel that a man being carried off by a thousand CGI fire-ants was any more implausible than a guys claymation face being melted off.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1670,JosHall87,Truth,7,10 October 2008,"Here's the thing with this film...I'd like to point out my dismay at some of the comments made. Many people care to point out all of the bad qualities of Indy 4 but none point out the good. I'd like to agree with most and say that a Lucas inspired ending was not the best one. The drawbacks in my personal opinion are this: the film doesn't have the ""dirty old fashioned"" feeling to it. As with most films today, it relies heavily on CGI. Some of the ideas are very far fetched. Examples include swinging from trees, sword fights on moving trucks and nuclear refrigerators. This was definitely the weakest of the 4 Indys but wasn't by any means a bad film. The bottom line is this: The witty humor is still there. The action is still there. The directing, music, and acting is still there. Isn't that what an Indy film is?

I'm glad to say that this film contains all those elements that are great chases,great quotes,interesting characters,excellent and well designed plot and other many elements that fans can remember from Raiders of the lost ark, temple of doom and the last crusade. This time the movie is set on late 50's, making Indiana's world different from before,because of that he can be older, but he is the same Indy we expect to see, with old and new friends, new enemies,unbelievable action scenes a new treasure to find.Many people make bad commentaries about this film because people often expect to a realistic and logic movie...but hey! is Indiana Jones and everybody had fun with those films (i'm wrong""-no!) because those are adventures are based on the great mysteries that had happened throughout history and it is great to see them as a great adventure and not as a logical and boring thing.

1672,pekara2323,"Good, not great.",7,22 May 2008,"I was able to catch the midnight showing last night and I must say that I could have waited. The movie was not horrible as I have read in other posts, but the one thing that I was hoping for, did not come to pass. I wanted to feel like a kid again when I saw this movie and it fell short in that area. I grew up with the original movies and for those that have not seen them, they are the real Indiana Jones.Now, there are elements from the other Indy films present, but the problem is that there is nothing original to this film with the exception of Harrison Ford being older. The whole movie seemed like it was just made to pay homage to the original 3, along with stealing the killer ants sequence directly from The Mummy.I do have to admit, Harrison Ford was great and only showed his age when he was asked to. He looks great for 65 and the outfit still does fit.Shia Lebouf was a positive addition to the film although it felt as though they tried too hard to set up the new Young Indiana Jones adventures to come. He did a nice job and provided one of the best action sequences of the film while sword fighting with Cate Blanchette. On the other hand the Tarzan vine swinging was one of the weaker moments and had Lucas' fingerprints all over it. George, just let Mr. Spielberg do his thing and stop trying so hard to ruin your franchises.The overall action was well shot and sequenced. I liked the addition of the nuclear bomb escape, but c'mon in a refrigerator...that was weak. The motorcycle chase scene was especially well done.I would recommend this film to anyone who can go into it without expecting to see the magic that the original 3 movies had. I would rate this as the 4th best in the series and hopefully if they do a movie with Shia (Henry Jones III)they incorporate a little more originality.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1673,Greentonic,13 heads are better than 12...? Yeah.,6,25 May 2008,"Despite the intense criticism online, I still walked into that theater with high hopes that the critics had been punked into watching a different version of the movie. I walked out thinking about what I had for dinner. Although not nearly as memorable, Indy and the Crystal Skull is still worth viewing, fluctuating between the good and the-No, Some parts were just dumb.The good! One would think 'surely there's SOMETHING good about this film? Its Indy after all!' Indeed! All things considered, the acting is pretty good from all of the cast. Ford's still got it and makes a cute couple with Allen. Like said by many, Shia LaBeouf is decent as the hair-combing sidekick and doesn't take away from the action. Allen is less spunky and more annoying in a motherly way but the less picky viewers will let that pass. My entire packed theater roared with laughter many times during the funny parts that make the series so great. And, best of all, you finally get to find out where the ark and all those other boxes are being kept.The bad- The movie just doesn't have the same mystique and sense of awe inspired by Raiders. Honestly, it begins with a gopher and ends in a cute 50's church so what can one expect? But more blatantly is the shift of focus from authentic, colorful, world wide influences and dusty history book based plots to a sci-fi theme, complete with anorexic aliens, X-file style. The action will catch you off guard, going from fast paced and exciting to suddenly cartoony. A leather-clad George of the Jungle scene? The infamous waterfall chase that seems to be screaming for a theme park ride based off of it? What were they thinking?New characters- rather disappointing. A story is only as good as its villain and Communists are the new Nazis in this latest installment. However, Nazis are forever and the commies just come off outdated, like watching a really old 007 after seeing Casino Royale. Cate Blanchett tries her best at playing Stalin's ""fair haired girl"" but the character just doesn't come off THAT evil, minus the 'wicked' haircut. (sorry, couldn't resist). The new tag-along Mac is...wait, how was he a threat again? Hm.Creativity is brain-melting low. Instead of many ingenious booby traps you get quick sand (wow!) A giant seesaw! Extras from Apocalypto with blow guns!Not to mention, the scene with the disappearing step-pyramid amid a swirling cloud of debris and ultimately being covered forever seemed to have burrowed generously from the The Mummy Returns. Also, more indirectly, the idea of using a sacred artifact to form a protective bubble around man eating bugs...once again, the dawning of the feeling that you've seen this somewhere before.Well, at least in the end the Jones family played lost and found service to martian men living in style in El dorado. Sheesh, no wonder they didn't want the plot in print before the release.In the end, the movie isn't as bad as a summary of the plot would make it sound.

I don't see how a 65 year old man could beat a 30+ year old Russian military-machine? and I mean beat him with bare fists, there were no crocodiles, propellers or stone crushers to get him out of the trouble.another thing that bugged me were those generic characters ""Irena"" and ""Mac"". the only thing they had to memorize is either ""Dr. Jones"" or ""Jonesey"" in various tones...this movie broke my heart.

1675,gfcpatton,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the Battlefield Earth of the Franchise,1,22 May 2008,"I was 8 years old when the last Indiana Jones movie was in the theater (Last Crusade), and I wish I had seen it on the big screen. So I was very excited to hear of the newest one coming out because now I would get to see my favorite movie character of all time on the silver screen.I waited in line for over 7 hours with some family and friends so we could get good seats. I now realize it wouldn't have mattered if we were last in line because the movie was so terrible.To begin with, John Williams REALLY dropped the ball (either by his choice or by instruction of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg) with the score. There were hardly any orchestrated songs like in the other 3 films, and the Indy Theme was practically non-existent. Too much relying on period-related songs, Elvis, etc. Not to say that they shouldn't have been used, but John Williams really could have made a kick ass score.There was way too much CGI/green screen. It was pretty obvious by the head shots and different action sequences. I understand new technology is available now and the film will look different/better than the last 3 in terms of crispness and color, etc. However, I think more faithfulness to the last should have been observed to make this newest installment feel like it fit. Also, the CGI Alien, CGI Monkeys, CGI Ants, CGI Prairie Dogs, etc were a bit much. Also, on a side note: the Ants were REALLY unbelievable as far as carrying someone whole and alive into a ant hill with no problem AND that they can be squished and have about 10 times as much goo come out of their bodies.The story line was very over the top; nuclear bomb being survived inside a refrigerator (maybe survive the blast, but survive being thrown around inside of one a half mile away and landing REALLY hard???), monkeys swinging with Shea/Mutt (and not attacking him), but then attacking the Commies, falling over a waterfall 3 times and none of the good guys being hurt, Area 51 as the place where ""Top Men"" are researching the Lost Ark (from Raiders) but also the Roswell Incident of 1947 has been filed away there, a la alien bodies,and the nostalgia was OK to include, but stop already - we get that Marcus Brody and Henry Jones, Sr are dead - please stop showing pictures of them and statues on campus that they heads come off of and hit Commies when they smash into them. Also, the whole Crystal Skull thing being turned into something about Aliens and Alien skulls and culminating into a very badly done CGI alien burning up the bad guy at the end before they fly off in the saucer (X-Files anyone?) was VERY bad, in my opinion. Not to mention the supporting characters, such as ""Ox"", felt like a lot of dead weight and very a bit over the top - it made feel embarrassed watching it.The acting was fairly decent. Shea and Harrison did a good job (despite the whole Tarzan performance by Shea). Karen Allen seemed way too forced and rusty. The Commies were believable at times, and then at others way over the top in the way they were stereo-typed and made to seem really dumb. Colonel Doctor/Professor Spalko as the main villain(ess) was crappy - she had a sword, (this isn't Pirates), she kept switching between a Russian and British accent, and her costume looked really stupid - it was not believable as a real uniform as the Nazi ones were in the other films.The sound effects were very good - included the Wilhelm scream/yell, the wet leather punch sound, and some decent bullet ricochet sounds.Misc: Indy hardly used his whip, no believable Romance (wedding at the end seem really cheesy), movie moved way to fast - no character development on new characters or re-introduction of past characters per se. Hardly any action sequences (fighting) - biggest one wasn't even with Indy - was with Mutt against the Spalko, and that was WAY over the top unbelievable.I gave this movie 1 star since I couldn't give a 0. It was a major let down for all the hype played into it. It did not live up to the past 3 films (Harrison didn't even have his shirt unbuttoned in this one). It was very slow in most parts, and the dialogue was tedious, the Macguffin was a joke, and the ending to tie it all together was very anti-climactic.The best part of this film was the period pieces, costumes, cars, sets, music were believable and were spot on.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1678,bcbrown3,Very Enjoyable,7,23 May 2008,"First things first. I found the movie to be very entertaining. It had the same style of humor as the earlier movies, the same completely over the top action sequences and story lines, and the same cheesy one liners. I particularly liked the way they poked fun at themselves regarding Harrison Ford's age. My only criticisms would be that Blanchett is not particularly threatening as the villain, and Lucas did in fact go a little overboard with the foreshadowing of Shia as taking over the franchise. Overall I'd say that while it is not as good as Raiders or Last Crusade, this was definitely superior to Temple of Doom.OK that aside, the comments of other reviewers on here are simply astounding to me. Complaints about aliens, surviving a nuclear blast in a refrigerator, and surviving a fall over a waterfall in a car are all valid arguments when critiquing the realism of the movie. However, and this is the crucial point here, we are talking about Indiana freaking Jones! Since when has this series ever been known for its gritty realism? The first movie featured the search for the ark of the covenant, an artifact that there is zero evidence of its existence. When the ark is found and opened its power proceeds to melt the faces of Indy's captors.The second movie featured a man who's heart had been pulled out of his chest living for some time thereafter, and a voodoo priest working with evil spirits to use stones to steal the souls of children.The third movie featured a 12th century crusader guarding the holy grail (here again no evidence that such an object actually existed) in the 1930s, that cup giving everlasting life and healing gunshot wounds, and a fake cup killing a man and turning him into dust. And all 3 featured Jones fighting off waves of attackers, avoiding automatic gunfire, etc.So to those who complain about the fourth movie for its lack of realism I ask you, have you actually seen the earlier films? Hasn't this franchise always been about absurd story lines and over the top action sequences? What on earth made you go into this movie expecting this one to be different? What kind of person goes to a movie like this and makes a mental checklist of times that the protagonist would have died in real life? I'm all for darker more realistic portrayals of life in some cases, but that is not what this particular series has ever striven for.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

From the outset when Indiana survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, albeit 'lead-lined' to the extra-dimensional staring contest between Indiana and an alien skull, we just couldn't stop laughing. The movie was a blast. I still can't believe how ridiculous it was! Unfortunately, too many people have have completely missed the point of the entire Indiana Jones series. None of them are meant to be taken even slightly seriously! The earlier movies barely make sense! In the first he fights Nazis trying to find the arc in order the bring about world domination, the second is about a cult of stone worshipers who rip people's hearts out and burn them alive and the third involves Indiana finding the holy grail! Aliens are hardly a diversion from the previous three's supernatural plots.This was one of the best slap-stick, action movies I've ever seen. Kudos to Spielberg and Lucas!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1683,weeyellowbloke,"Tries hard, but ultimately misses",5,23 May 2008,"After so many butcherings of classic movie franchises in recent years I found myself highly skeptical about this film. As a result I avoided any details on it and kept my expectations low. Unfortunately they were not low enough and I still left the cinema disappointed because no matter how low my expectations I still had the original trilogy buzzing in the back of my mind.Firstly the good points. Harrison Ford can still pull off the character of Indiana Jones. In spite of the age the hero we know and love is still there and still brings most of the energy and smiles to the film. Shia LaBoeuf was nowhere near as irritating as I thought he'd be and puts in a decent performance developing some believable chemistry with Ford and Karen Allen is pleasant surprise. The action scenes are slightly hit and miss, but are mainly decent and there are a few laughs to be had along the way.Now for the bad points, the main one of which is the script, which is frankly appalling. Yes it has one or two good lines but after 20 years there should be something more than that. Firstly the opening is underwhelming. You'd expect after such a big build up Dr Jones would be introduced back into our lives with some form of action or drama, but instead he is just plonked in front of camera with little ceremony. Secondly many of the characters felt completely undeveloped and it was very hard to have any feelings towards them. Ray Winstones character of Mac was completely one-dimensional, flat and unnecessary, so much so that his 'emotional' death at the end was met by nothing more than a shrug by the other characters. Cate Blanchett was just hamming it up with a ridiculous Ukranian accent and never felt like much of a threat or even particularly evil and John Hurt had so little to work with as the gibbering Professor Oxley I felt sorry for him. Thirdly most of the danger faced by Indy and his crew seemed to be met with nothing more than mild inconvenience. A nuclear explosion is not the problem if you have a fridge, three gigantic waterfalls just seemed to get them a bit wet and quicksand just seemed to be an everyday annoyance. In short there was none of the tension seen in the previous films such as 'The Last Crusade' when you don't know what traps await, but you've just seen a guy get his head chopped of by it. And finally the general plot. Thinking about it the alien story might have worked if handled better. It has the right balance of history, mystery and paranormal, but where it went wrong was being so in-your-face about it, you could see the conclusion before it had even started. Come on guys, leave a bit up to the viewers imagination, maybe leave the end as bit inconclusive as to whether it was aliens or not rather than having a bloody great spaceship rise out the ground, and was there any need for them to be inter-dimensional rather than from space? In conclusion well done to Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf putting in decent performances and making the most of what you had to work with, but in the end this wasn't a good movie let alone a good Indiana Jones movie. Spielberg seems to have tried his hardest to keep the film above the water and in line with the original trilogy so I can forgive him, but stay away from CGI please. As for Lucas, seriously if you don't stop then the film going public is going to take out a court order against you to never touch a pen, typewriter or any film making equipment on penalty of torture.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1684,mortweb,"Great film until the end (***MAJOR SPOILER***)(Do not read if not seen the movie yet, please !!!)",4,24 May 2008,"The end was unnecessary, why put an alien in it, why couldn't there be like the Mayan kings in that chamber instead of the alien. It would have been more likely, but i respect that Indiana Jones in the first place where to be seen as supernatural on some ways, but not that supernatural. I hope if there is a fifth that the story will be different and do not have with the alien. The part with the fridge was totally unlikely, how survive a nuclear attack, it's impossible. I hope if there is a fifth that it will be some kind of better story with more characterization and a more reliable plot than in this one. There is not existing aliens, but i respect that it's just fictional and will be used in other films in the future, but i think it's a cliché that have been used up a long time ago.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1685,snwbluebyyou,Enjoyable Fun,7,26 May 2008,"This movie was exactly what I expected it to be.An Indiana Jones movie filled with all kinds of unbelievable gags, factual, and technical errors. In true Indiana Jones fashion it was campy and cheesy.But really, who cares? It was entertaining great fun and a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon with the wife.Spielberg and Lucas did not try to reinvent Indy or make any kind of historically accurate film, they pretty much kept the status quo on the franchise.If you want a factual film, watch a documentary on the History channel, if you want a good laugh and forget about the seriousness of real life, go see this fourth installment of the Indy franchise.When it comes out on DVD we will add it to the collection.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1686,bdphill,Lucas is trying to figure out how bad he can make movies and people will still go...,1,22 May 2008,"I don't think I will be giving away any of the plot because there actually is no plot.I'll start off by saying that the previous three Indiana Jones movies are my favorite movies of all time. When I heard about the fourth one I was excited but thought they should have left it alone because the third one ended the trilogy so perfectly. However, I went to this movie with enthusiam and I really really wanted to like it. Afterwards I figured out that was impossible.I thought the movie would be cheapened by Shia's character or the fact that Indy's character would be about 20 years older. Those were actually some of the very few things that were actually good about this movie. Shia gave a good performance and I actually liked his character. They also did a good job of transitioning to an older Indiana.But the movie just got ridiculous. It started alright as he is escaping the Russians which had invaded a warehouse in Area 51. However, once he escaped they threw in a completely pointless scene. Which, and wait til you hear this one, is that Indiana stumbles upon a mock town set up in Nevada to judge the effects of an Atomic Bomb at, of course, the time of the test. So in order to escape, he jumps into a refrigerator, which they point out is lead lined (will that really help), right before the explosion hits. He is then tossed a few miles in this, outside of the blast area. The door stays closed, he isn't injured while being thrown in this thing at all and feels no ill effects of radiation... YUP.The middle was alright, with some cool chase scenes, decent dialogue, and a cool jungle chase scene with vehicle to vehicle fighting. Indiana did very little of the fighting, and none of it if you exclude hand to hand combat. One of the few bright spots was Shia doing the fighting instead of Indiana.But everything else was terrible. There was an incredibly boring part where they find the skull. Let me summarize that. They find the ruins it is hidden in. They walk through the ruins. They find the skull. And it only got worse from there.After the cool chase scene in the Jungle they escape gigantic ants by a really creepy guy holding the skull in front of them. Then they drive the car (which is also a boat... yeah, I know) off a cliff, but their landing (which is of course in a river) is cushioned by a huge tree that they hit and bends them down to place them gently in the water (Seriously). They then fall off 3 massive water falls, the 5 characters, in this car/boat (that has a jagged glass windshield at this point), and land in the car safely the first two times, and then just each in the water safely after the third one (Seriously, Im gonna say that a lot).Oh! Then they find the entrance to the temple / city thing they are looking for. I couldn't have imagined anything less cool. After simply walking through this they get out the other side to find the city but realize they are being chased by some native people (which aren't explained at all). And how do they survive this, the creepy guy points the skull at them, gee they didn't do this before. Then they get to the middle of the city and break off some things to drain the middle structure of the sand that is in it, then have to quickly run down a circular stair cast that is going away as they run (Which is why Disney should be suing since this was stolen from National Treasure).OK, at this point you're thinking ""well this hasn't been that good, but they've reached the temple, the movie can be saved because here comes the cool part! Here comes the action and the interesting plot that brings it all together."" That couldn't be more incorrect.Here's how I will summarize that part to give it all the credit it deserves. Indiana (and group) walk, yes I said walk (nothing else), through the temple. Creepy guy who doesn't talk carries skull and points it at a door (gee they didn't do the pointing the skull thing before). Indiana holds it up to the door, it opens. Yup, there's your big ACTION / ADVENTURE.AND THEN... They find a room of 13 ALIENS, made completely OUT OF CRYSTAL, but aren't alive. The Russians walk, take the skull and the woman places it on the NECK OF THE LAST ALIEN. The room then STARTS SPINNING UNCONTROLLABLE. Indiana and his group dive out. The aliens then JOIN TO CREATE ONE LIVE ALIEN and use their mind powers to EVAPORATE THE Russian WOMAN. Then Indiana (and group) run out of the temple. No, no real action unless you consider him begging his friend that has betrayed him twice to come with and not to waste time taking treasure action (he dies, just like the mummy, lawsuit?). After they get out by sitting in a WATER CANNON THAT BLASTS THEM OUT they witness the city TURN INTO A FLYING SAUCER THAT ZIPS AWAY! Yup! It really is that ridiculous. They then play some incredibly lame thing about how the gift was knowledge in writing that is on the same level as Anakin's reasoning for going to the dark side in Star Wars Ep 3. After that Indiana marries, yes marries, Marion (girl from the first one) because Shia's character is really their kid. And then they do another lame transition of how he is going to be the next Indiana Jones by Indy's hat being blown almost into his hands by the wind right before Harrison Ford snatches it and walks out.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1687,grimmsister,Entertaining like always,8,26 May 2008,"I read some reviews and I feel I should comment on this one as well. I was surprised about the fact that some people were disappointed. This is certainly an Indiana Jones movie as it is supposed to be. It has all the Jones-ingredients to make it work and I felt the same when I saw the other movies for the first time. Of course it's over the top, not realistic and full of action! I love to see Harrison Ford 20 years later in his old shoes and hat. Cate Blanchett is enjoying her role as evil Russian/Ukrainian genius. I hope that there will be more of it. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg proved again that doctor Henry Jones Jr. is some kind of a teacher!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1688,Paese,Nearly average one !,7,2 October 2008,"Just agree with almost all of the comments that contain the opinion that it was disappointing for the true Indiana Jones fan-community.When i watched the movie there was always this hope that it could get a very good one, but the last 10 minutes really knocked me down in my chair.I just think and create my own version of the movie without the last 10 minutes and imagine for myself another ending like this.. then it actually is a wonderful movie ! Ford acts great (like the old Indy !) and through the whole movie you have often the feeling like you had in the old ones !so Mr. Lucas please republish a DVD-Version with a Special Cut concerning an other ending like this and most of the pundits will love you again :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1689,Boges15,Just Enjoy that Indy's Back,7,9 June 2008,"I don't think there was any way this film could live up to the expectations that its predecessors set. The way people, myself included, feel about the previous three films will undoubtedly cloud our judgment on what the film itself actually was suppose to be about. I was expecting so much from this film before I saw. But after I saw it, I realized that I didn't care about its flaws. Whatever those flaws may be, it was just exciting to see Indiana on the big screen. Maybe it was because I had never seen Indiana on the big screen before, since I was 7 when the Last Crusade came out. For the first time in a while I was thrilled to be watching a movie with good action and old tricks that made me laugh relating them back to the original films. I think people need to stop being critical of this film, stating that it ruined the Indy franchise. After such a long absence and seeing sub-par movies put out left and right these days, it was good to see the American hero return to the big screen probably for the last time. Ignore all the negative comments and reviews of the film, just enjoy seeing Indy back on the big screen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1690,SullyT1313,Very Disappointing,4,25 May 2008,"This movie goes down as one of my biggest letdowns in all my movie experiences. This movie is on the same level as Spiderman 3, The Godfather part III, and Rocky Five.Most of the stunts and action sequences where ruined by mediocre CGI at best. The scene where Mutt becomes Tarzan and swings from the trees is just ridiculous. And the involvement of the monkeys completely removed me from the movie.The alien plot crossed the line in my opinion. I can go along with the contents of the Ark taking the souls of all who look upon it, I'll play along with a man pulling a still beating heart out of a another guy, even a Knight staying in a tiny room for a few hundred years guarding the cup of Christ. But aliens just seem too far-fetched. It seems like the writers stole the idea from Stargate SG-1.The worst parts of the movie where the unnecessary additions to the stunts. A person cannot survive an atomic blast by hiding in a led lined refrigerator. After the chase scene they could have driven the amphibious vehicle off the cliff into the river, but they had to have them land in a tree that bent like rubber and just troll off into the water.There where some good scenes that gave the movie the Indiana Jones feel such as the warehouse scene and the sand pit scene but I personally missed the scenes in where there in a booby trapped temple, cave, or building not enough of the classic Indiana Jones style.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1691,some_guy1989,Why not look at it for what it is?(maybe spoilers),8,2 June 2008,"While yes I agree there are some outrageous scenes, but let me think hmm what type of movie is this? It is an action/adventure movie therefore it aims to entertain an keep you at the edge of you're seat. I remember the scene in the 2nd Indy where they landed unharmed after jumping out of a plane using nothing but a life boat, or a tiny rock managing to jam a tank's gun. Most people saying that it is a bad movie are mainly complaining about these outrageous scenes but I respect it for what it is, a fun action movie that reminds me of the good old days. I laughed when it wanted me to and was at the edge of my seat during action sequences. Indy is older now, but he still kicks ass. There are ruins explored,guns and fisticuffs scenes, Indy showing his wit, Isn't that what we wanted from this movie? Speaking of old, I'd like to commend Ford's ability to still be able to play this character and doing it well for his age. Although I was disappointed at the lack of things getting whipped.Overall, its a fun movie to watch. Get the stick out of your ass and just enjoy it for what it is. Don't expect some Schindler's List story, or Die Hard explosions. It's Indy in the 50's, and he still kicks ass.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1692,sophie-watts-1,What a joke....,1,23 May 2008,"I grew up watching Indiana Jones and this movie is one of the worst pieces of film I have ever seen. And it has a rating of over 8 stars? I get the stinking suspicion the studio must hire some poor intern to make up yahoo names and vote over and over again giving this a ten. First off - he survives a nuclear blast in a fridge? yeah, right - then five people fall from waterfalls without a scratch? Cate Blanchett's accent is horrible and the monkey swinging scene with the man eating ants - what a piece of CRUD this movie was. Just a shame to the entire Indie series -- and pretty obvious the kid was going to be Indy's with Maryanne!

1693,west_5050,"Haters - Stop crying, grow up, and just enjoy the film for what it is!",8,29 May 2008,"I really enjoyed this film!!! It has all the aspects of an Indiana Jones movie; action, humour, history, and adventures across many locales! The action is non stop and fits the story well. Harrison Ford comes back into his role as our favourite archaeologist perfectly, its as if those 19 years had never passed! I had a huge grin on my face all the way through this movie, I was so glad to see Indiana Jones back on screen! I have some thoughts for those who seem to have a problem with this movie (the minority). I think the reason so many people seem to have made small issues into big problems is because when they saw the original trilogy they were a lot younger and have fond childhood memories of the films.This, in turn, affects how they watch the films now in their adulthood. They enjoy the films because they have enjoyed them since childhood. Now they have grown older and perhaps more critical and cynical of EVERYTHING it seems. In short, some people appear to have lost the ability to just get lost in a movie and enjoy the ride for what it is.Some people complain that the plot was too unrealistic... a crystal skull as the remains of an alien corpse, Indy in a refrigerator, a UFO stored underneath the temple...But let me ask you, how is this any more unrealistic than, say, an ancient ark which holds spirits that can melt your face off, or hanging on to an underwater submarine for a lengthy amount of time before it docks (Raiders of the Lost Ark)? Or jumping out of an aeroplane in a rubber boat, having your heart ripped out leaving no scar and staying alive, drinking blood and going crazy, and stones that can give life/death to a village (Temple of Doom)? Or a cup that can give/take life, a Knight that has been waiting thousands of years in a room but doesn't look a day over 70, or drinking from a false Grail can suddenly turn you into a zombie (Last Crusade)? To us, these were all magnificent and magical aspects of the films, and our adult minds have failed to see the fact that these too are unrealistic, because we enjoyed them so much as children.I'm sure if you watched crystal skull in the 80's, you would have enjoyed it, and not had so many problems with it now.Likewise, if Raiders or Temple or Crusade were released in 2008, would the modern adult critical minds pan the film for being unrealistic??? ""The part where the Nazi's faces melted off was ridiculous"" or ""It was too far fetched when he becomes a zombie after drinking from the false grail"" etc.I watched the original films as a child, enjoyed them, and enjoyed crystal skull as well (some may say that i am still a child or at least very young at 19). You have to watch and appreciate these films as an adventure film and an escape from reality.I personally loved the movie, its not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, no, but it never was going to be (for the reasons i explained above, plus the fact that people have an annoying habit of just slamming a movie that may venture slightly away from an original formula). I would place this film below The Last Crusade and above The Temple of Doom. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull had fun, humour, lots of action, and Indiana Jones... we had the explosive beginning, the calm back at Marshall college, the introduction of the treasure or idol, the enemy, and the race to get the treasure first... with plenty of Indiana Jones style sequences thrown in for good measure... Is that not what the old films were also about? as I have said before, some people seem to have lost the ability to enjoy a movie for what it is, and instead have grown into obsessed critical viewers who cant wait to see how they can ruin a movie with their itchy trigger happy typing fingers...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1694,Jaedyn_Conley,"A word about the music,...",9,26 May 2008,"I know most people will be focusing on the story and direction, acting and visuals for their reviews but I am a film composer and teacher, specializing in the area of music for film. For me a lot of the experience of going to see the Indiana (and Star Wars) films is to take in what delightful surprises John Williams has created for us.On this particular occasion I was slightly disappointed and if there is any reason that I might detract from the films rating it would be because of the liberal re-use and recycling of pre- existing music from previous Indiana installments. To me, it gave the film a slightly lazy and under-achieved quality, the music seemingly like an after-thought. This is of course, based off of one single solitary viewing but it just didn't seem to dig as deep as the scores from the previous movie. It is understandable that a lot of the leitmotif would be revisited in this film, but overall I was disappointed by the seeming lack of fresh, new themes and material.Even the incidental music seemed a bit cliché and formulaic, and for me this really dampened the experience.Perhaps my qualifications disqualify me because I am more acutely aware of what is transpiring musically than most people in the theater, but I think that in this particular case rather than anchoring the film to the established spirit and theme of the Indiana Jones myth the music actually defeats the spirit of the film by the use of oppositional aesthetic subtleties. Why dare to be daring and bring Indiana into a new era and age and then use a dusty and aged underscore? Granted I haven't had any opportunity to study the score (and believe me I will) but it seems to me the film fails on this level. I have noticed in recent films John Williams seems tired and out of ideas, and for as a Williams fan I find that idea rather distressing. Williams' music of late seems very static, angular, and clunky- not moving around as much and not possessing the edge it used to. Perhaps John Williams' best recent score would be the scores from the ""Harry Potter"" series which has an edge to it similar to the brilliance displayed in the early Star Wars and Indian Jones work. In fact, I have often commented that the Harry Potter music seems to me like stuff that was written for Star Wars that was either never used or discarded and kept in some notebook of ideas somewhere waiting for a time when Williams needed ideas.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a fine installment in the series, and the emergence of Indiana into a new decade and age was a graceful feat executed with finesse and aplomb. Overall it is a fine achievement worthy of the Indiana Jones franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1695,edmundashton,Utterly disappointing,2,25 May 2008,"I had been looking forward to this film for quite some time and went to see it last night. The opening 6 or 7 minutes were well done, reminiscent of the previous films style. However with the arrival of Cate Blanchett's character the entire movie took a down turn. Her portrayal of a Russian agent was pitiful from the start and didn't even slightly measure up to previous villains.Around about 25 minutes into the film I was so close to walking out when Indy survives a nuclear bomb by hiding in a fridge - unbelievable! All the essence of the other films was lost and the constant references to the previous films started to grate quite heavily.George Lucas' obsession with special effects took the film to a new low and the lack of even a plausible storyline completely ruined the franchise for me.Ford and Winstone were terrible. thats not to say they are not fantastic actors but the script made them work too hard without any possibility of success. The reference to Han Solo with ""Ive got a bad feeling about this"" was completely uncalled for and the idea that a man of Indiana Jone's credentials would leave a pregnant woman at the alter in 1930s America is just not right.The only real bright spark from this film is Shia LaBeouf's character who is a breath of fresh air apart from the fact that his name is Henry Jones the third and is shocked to find out that Indy is his father. I mean come on what the hell is all that about. The ending leaves the franchise open for a sort of sequel with LaBeouf at the helm. All I can hope for is that Hollywood will not destroy the Indy series anymore and let sleeping dogs lie from now on. I predict great things for LaBeouf in the future but this is not one of them.To sum up, if you love the first three films then do not watch this as it will be just a great big let down to the fans.Spielberg and Lucas will be laughing at us all the way to the bank.Nuff Said!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Iam also curious what Frank Darabount's (spelling?) script was like. It must of been better than this? Grrrrr. Im soooo angry that i witnessed this bastard of a movie. Please, someone STOP Lucus from continuing to rape his old creations. FOR the love of all cinema STOP LUCUS. He has become a monster. So...what else can is say? Raiders i give a 10. Temple of Doom i give a 7. Last Crusade i give a 7. Crystal Skull...a 1. (for what I've seen this summer so far: Iron Man a 8. Speed Racer a 5.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1698,stacysouthworth,Falls a little short,7,27 May 2008,"Overall, this movie wasn't as bad as everyone seems to think it was. I came away a little disappointed, not because of the story or plot, but because of the overall feeling of the movie. I miss the little ""mini"" adventure that Indiana usually goes through at the beginning of his movies- Raiders of the Lost Ark- Indiana's adventure in obtaining the golden idol, Temple of Doom- The club scene in China with the diamond, Last Crusade- The Cross of Coronado. Those scenes, while not having much to do with the rest of the movie, give you a little shot of adventure before the real one begins. I also was a little disappointed in Harrison Ford. I think he may have lost a little of his Indiana Jones persona in the last 20 years. He seemed to be a grumpier version of Sean Connery's character in Last Crusade, but less funny. I missed his little ""Indiana Jones-isms"" like the great facial expressions he had in his previous movies. He seemed to be enjoying being Indiana in previous movies. In this one, he seemed like he was going through the motions. Especially when you see the fight with the big Russian in this movie. In previous movies, Indiana always seems to be having fun fighting the big, buff German or Tuggie (?). In Crystal Skull, he didn't seem to be in the mood. I wasn't disappointed in anyone else. I knew that Shia Lebeouf would do a pretty good job. Karen Allen was lacking a little in her performance, but she was okay. It was hard for me to be afraid for Indiana when the Russians were around, though. In previous movies, you developed a dislike for the Nazis, but the Russians were far from terrifying. Cate Blanchett was okay as a villain, but I didn't get a fear vibe from her. I almost thought it would be smarter for Indy to join forces with her to get through the jungle instead of fighting from vehicle to vehicle. I mean, they had the big machine that ate through trees and made a freeway through the jungle, right? As far as the movie being believable, I didn't have a problem with the story. Indiana Jones is always running into strange adventures. This was just another adventure. Aliens or not, it was an okay story. The humor fell a little short sometimes, though. Overall, it was a fairly entertaining movie and I will probably buy it when it comes out on DVD, just to complete my Indiana Jones collection, but I won't go see it again in the theater.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1699,angel091582,I enjoyed the movie,10,23 May 2008,The movie was great!!!!!!!!!! It had been a long time since I had see the Indy movies but I was very glad I went to see this one. I think that this was a bit different but good. I really like Shia LaBeauf he is a very good actor. He has come a long way and I feel that his part in the movie was great. One of the reasons why I went to see the movie was because of Shia. Harrison Ford also did a great comeback as Indy. I would recommend this movie to everyone.This movie had a lot of action and would keep you on your toes.I think that the plot of the film was good. I don't want to spoil the movie so I will not discuss the plot. I just think that the plot was very interesting and original.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1700,melissasview,"It's really good, folks!",8,22 May 2008,"This movie is really good, folks! It never takes itself too seriously and is very entertaining.It goes out of its way to acknowledge Indy's age, which gives an opportunity for new humor and a new perspective for Indy. Don't worry about Harrison Ford still playing an action hero. It is expertly handled. They make it credible by playing up his years of experience and quick-witted intelligence.There are many laughs throughout and tons of action. It starts slow, but is fast-paced to the end after that. The writing and cast are great. Shia LaBouf is nothing like Jar-Jar Binks. The relationship between his character and Harrison Ford's character provides a lot of humor derived from their contrast in age and know-how in times of adventure.If you are looking for an old-fashioned, fun experience at the movies, then go get in line for this one!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1701,sschevelleofdarkness,"If you're a true fan of Indiana Jones or action movies, go see this film.",10,25 May 2008,"Really all that needs to be said about this movie is that it is an Indiana Jones movie. To say that its a ""good"" Indiana Jones Movie would be redundant. I'm tired of seeing what people have to say about this movie in reviews and posts. If you don't like it, why come to its IMDb page? Also, why argue over it? If you are a fan of the originals and didn't like this movie, you're a moron. This feels just like the old movies in every way and continues the story in true Indy fashion, with action and humor mixed in a way that few movies have been able to duplicate. The stunt work and CGI looked believable and I give all due respect for Mr. Ford for being in better shape than most people are at any point in their lives. The only small gripes I'd have with the movie would be killing off Henry Jones Sr. along with Marcus. Sean Connery isn't dead he just declined to be in the movie, they could have just said he was elsewhere, maybe a retirement home or left him out of the movie completely. Sallah wasn't in the movie either but they didn't say he was dead so what gives? Another thing is the alien in the movie, he looked about as cliché' as an alien could look, at least E.T.'s design took some imagination. The villain's death also took a little too long in comparison to the other films in my opinion.But finally we can say, if this is the final film, that the Indy saga has a true happy ending and the story comes full circle as it strangely never did before. It all came together to be one of the best films to come out this decade and I hope all the true Indiana Jones fans go to see it and can take their children to see it.

Should have stopped at the last Indiana movie and should NOT have gone to see this...Please, please no more sequels like this...What a waste of time! If it weren't for Harisson Ford and Kate Blanchet (both of which I can't believe they willingly singed on for this...)

1703,eduardovictory,"Not The Best of The Indiana Jones Pictures, But Still A Fun Film",8,25 July 2008,"Okay, this movie is fun. When I went into the theater, I wasn't expecting another Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom or Last Crusade. I was kind of expecting this movie to suck, but it didn't. The movie was entertaining. It certainly wasn't better than Raiders of the Lost Ark, but I thought it was on the same level as Temple of Doom and Last Crusade. The over-the-top action sequences are what this series is all about. I remember the scene from Raiders where Indy is in the Nazi hideout after he has clung to the submarine and is trying to pull on the knocked out officer's clothes and he is discovered by another. Indy proceeds to punch him and his hat flies off his head. In Temple of Doom, the Maja Raja(I hope I spelled that correctly)is stabbing and burning Indy with a Voo-do doll for Pete's sake. Last Crusade has the Indy and Elsa swimming in Petroleum.Crystal Skull is not a perfect film, I didn't like the hazy look that all of Spielberg's recent films have(We can thank Janusz Kaminski for that), it didn't have the look of the previous films. But, the action was great.What I did like about the film is that it's cheesy, just like the 50's sci-fi films of the day, for example, the very ""so-so"" received fridge sequence. I thought it was classic Indiana Jones, he gets into a situation in which he's in way over his head and finds a crazy solution(Remember the scene where the tank goes over the cliff in Last Crusade?). Also, I loved the Hangar 51 sequence, that was the scene that really established the return of Indiana Jones. Overall, it was a great film, I really enjoyed it and hope there isn't another Indiana Jones film on the way, but I'm sure 19 years from now, this is going to be seen as a classic, just like the first three Indiana Jones pictures.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

When I finally got myself a ticket to watch the avant premiere I was like a kid in a candy store. The first impression was that it wasn't that bad, Harrisson Ford did his bit like he did in the first three movies, the humor in this movie was somewhat the same as in the hree previous movies. So far so good. BUT when ""young Indy"" (old Indy's son) was slinging from one three to another with some monkeys next to him, I knew, that this movie would not be as good as I thought. When they talked about aliens, the first thing I said to myself was: ""I hope there won't be no UFO's in this flick"". My words weren't out of my mouth yet, or, yes indeed, a huge UFO came out of the ground with a ET like being behind the wheels. I'm sorry Steven Spielberg, maybe you like aliens, but do NOT, I repeat, do NOT put these creatures in an Indiana JOnes movie please !!! You've ruined THE chance to make an awesome movie like ""national treasure"" or like the previous three Indiana Jones movies.Now I know why Sean Connery didn't want anything to do with this movie, it really really really SUCKS !!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Wtf?? You have disappointed me a lot Conclusion: It's a film to forget, and for the lovers of Indiana this must be forgotten, to not make dirty those trilogies.

1706,sbrumbelow-1,Enjoyable,8,29 May 2008,"This movie, to say non the least, was very enjoyable. It has some of the aspects that the originals had, but does not quite match up to the power of the first. But, that doesn't mean its bad. I see everyone shunning this movie like its the black plague. There is no reason for people to question or dissect this movie through the IMDb boards. Pointing out plot holes and so on. Why? This is not one of those movies to watch extensively and question every mistake they made in it. The movie was made to be watched and to be just enjoyable. If you watch the other ones there are an equal amount of plot holes and mistakes.The movie did have some bad dialogue from here and there, but is forgettable. The action scenes are very excellent. The chase scenes in the movie were phenomenal. The chemistry between Indy and mutt is great. The ending is very well, like the very first indy. CGI is used from here to there, but not extensively. Not so mysterious as the others, but mysterious to say the least.The kind of disappointment came to many with POTC 2, Many people I know hated it. But as they watched a second time, or on DVD, they loved it, and enjoyed it. The same will happen with this movie.

The 1st and 3rd movies, Raiders and Crusade, were arguably the best in the series. The 2nd was a little out there, but enjoyable and well put together. It was the characters, writing and action scenes that really put the Raiders and Crusade at the top. At least the action scenes in Raiders and Crusade were believable and somewhat realistic, the scenes in Skulls were a disappointment. Too much CGI and ridiculous action sequences that remind me of B-rate movies. The writing was somewhat intelligent, but towards the end of the movie I was ready to walk out without watching the ending. The 1st and 3rd movies conjured up historical artifacts long lost and still to this day not known where they are. The 2nd and 4th movies conjured up ancient conspiracies or fictional societies that stretch reality too far, which is what made Indiana Jones movies so good in the first place. Although it was a stretch from reality, the guy still made it out and in memorable fashion.

I anticipated this movie more than any movie I've ever seen before, and sadly I was disappointed beyond belief. If any long time fan is looking for an Indy sequel that does justice to the Indy of old, don't come looking here.The movie could stand alone and be a decent film, but it is no where close to classic Indiana Jones. Parts of this movie really shine and got me pumped up like watching the old films but then other parts went so over the top, it brought the movie way down.Harrison Ford's age has no effect on the movie at all. If you ask me, the 65 year old is still at the top of his game. But the ridiculous special effects and pointless, over-the-top scenes really brought this film down. Personally, if they release a directors cut and delete the outrageous parts this movie could fit with the other Jones films.

How could this have happened? This is probably the biggest disappointment of my life.The movie isn't all bad. About half of it is classic Indiana Jones. Some great shots. Some great action scenes.But it is all ruined by several factors. For one, an extreme excess of cg. Highlight below to see some of the worst offenses. At the beginning of the movie you see a whole group of cg prairie dogs watching the rocket sled. The flying fridge is cg. Another prairie dog is cg. Some of the action scenes are just loaded with cg. The worst cg in the film was the monkeys. Mutt Williams ends up in the jungle vines when he sees one real monkey. Then suddenly we see a whole troop of cg monkeys that start jumping and swinging on vines, so Mutt starts to do the same. It's awful. Then the monkeys start attacking the bad guys. Harrison Ford is still Indiana Jones, but he is given some bad dialog throughout. Ford does an impressive job with the action scenes and plays the role as well as he can, so it's not his fault that his character is so poorly written. Of all the characters in the movie, Indy gets the most character development, but that's not saying very much.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1711,schultzm84,Worth the wait? Not quite,1,22 May 2008,"I went to the midnight showing of Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (I still can't believe that was the best name they could come up with) and I left both tired and disappointed. While there were great moments of nostalgia and classic Indy one liners that I'm sure brought smiles to the faces of everyone in the house, the movie was seriously lacking in plot, character development and the quality pacing that made the first movie so special. What was really upsetting to me was the apparent lack of effort put into the script. There were obvious rehashes from many movies including the Mummy, The Jungle Book, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jumanji (yes, that's right, Jumanji) that made me wonder aloud. ""It really took them 19 years to write this movie?"" The action in the movie never wanes and no one would say that this movie is dull, but the fact that there was very little interaction between the characters or thoughtful dialogue as there was in the first and third movies really detracted from the overall quality of the film. The tendency of the movie to rush reminded me very much of the difference between the first Jurassic Park and the third Jurassic Park. The not-so-subtle shift from detail in the first to over-the-top special effects in the third was painfully evident in this movie as well.Overall, this is an entertaining film, but when you're using the Indiana Jones and Spielberg and Harrison Ford brands, its not unreasonable to expect more than a fun summer movie (that's what Get Smart will be for). I expected this movie to at least justify bringing a beloved character out of retirement after so many years, and on that point, it fell far short.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1712,peteray,Why George why?,3,30 May 2008,"When it comes to Indiana Jones I have as much of a hard time choosing my favourite one as i do choosing my all time top five films. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have made my decision a hell of a lot easier! Believe me Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not on the same level as the other three. Now don't get me wrong i thought the first 2/3rds was the classic Indy that i have grown up with but the second Cate Blanchet rolled out that alien corpse i felt my heart shatter. Then i thought ""Steve why the hell have you made another alien movie!"". When i go and see War of the Worlds i expect to see aliens but not in an Indy movie.The only conclusion i have come to as to why this amazing flaw has been made is that the title Indiana Jones was merely put in front of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull because everyone loves Indiana Jones, a sci-fi audience is much smaller. I fell for it so i suppose it worked. Whether it's a money making venture or truly a bad judgement I don't know. I came out of that cinema feeling deflated, heartbroken and ripped off. Honestly i don't think that movie fits the trade descriptions act. You have to ask yourself though... were aliens implied in a single trailer?These are the reasons I ask ""why George why?"". And if you're wandering: Last Crusade, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, Wolf Creek then Kingdon of the Crystal Skull If I'm honest tomorrow i will feel different about the top two.

1713,wwwme23-1,Why????,1,22 May 2008,"Let me first say that I came into this movie thinking that it would not live up to the previous movies in the trilogy. However, I did not expect for this movie to completely ruin a franchise of movies. From the beginning, this movie was doomed. The opening camera shot was of a gopher that was very similar to the one in Caddyshack. This detail was irrelevant and unnecessary. Spielberg plugged in many ridiculous things like this. For example the monkeys which aided Shia LaBeauf ward off the KGB woman scientist.Just Ridiculous!!!! It flat out didn't make sense. As for the rest of the movie it was also atrocious. The bullets could not find a target. Automatic guns would go through a round of bullets and come nowhere near hitting Indiana Jones. Ford even acted with slow and delayed reflexes in the beginning. Still bullets could not hit him.Next, the plot made no sense. It often took many meaningless turns towards nothingness. Did SPielberg just need to add extra footage because it was not long enough? One such example was when he found himself in the fake town which was getting destroyed. He was able to survive a nuclear bomb being dropped on him. Not only did he do this he did it in a refrigerator. This refrigerator luckily was spit out of the bombs path and cast just outside the radius of the blast. When Harrison Ford left the safety of the refrigerator, he was unscathed. Not a single mark. GOing over 3 waterfalls, Skidding on the floor for 30 seconds after falling off of a motorcycle, and lastly after the blast.Shia LeBeauf is one of the worst actors ever! Just horrendous! He came into the movie playing a tough guy who rode a motorcycle. I couldn't take him seriously, its still Shia LeBeauf. He tried to fight with a switch blade knife and i was still unable to take him seriously. The guy just looked like such a punk. He cannot act and almost all of his line were unbelievably unnecessary and stupid.Overall: Horrible acting, Bad action sequences, Horrendous plot (was there one?), and so many flaws.It definitely deserves the one, and if you think otherwise watch the movie and you will shortly know what I am talking about.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1714,atlfrog,Old Indiana Jones...,7,24 May 2008,"OK so, I have been waiting for this movie for about 19years and 8 months or so and I was real excited about showing up to the movie theater and seeing this film. Sitting through the two hours of chases, explosions, gag lines, etc. I will give this movie a solid 7/10 and this is why.First off, anyone expecting this movie to be anything like the original three are completely missing the point of the film. The story takes place 19 or so years after the the last movie. This is not only a different decade, but in fact a different Indiana Jones. You find out he was in the military with a high ranking job and several medals. You are slightly lead to believe that he has settled down a bit and his course of action has completely changed. From a realistic point of view an archaeologist goes to sites to discover new cultures and what not and from what I have gathered his real adventures kind of ended with the last crusade and now he is kind of thrown back into it all again. I know that during the film he has explored and found other great artifacts and it also mentions he has spied on the ""Reds"" while in the military, but there is no real emphasis on any real adventures like the last three movies. What we have to remember after finding the ark, holy grail and the Sankara stones (I can't spell at all), how can you top all of that. I got the feeling that Indiana Jones has now become a professional teacher and ""normal"" archaeologist. That's the feeling I get (If there are more books coming out maybe you can prove me wrong! HINT HINT).Secondly, the CGI with the stupid prairie dogs I could have done without. George Lucas likes to add these little stupid distractions and all I wanted to do was scream at the screen. Also, the CGI with the monkeys I also could have done without. What the heck? It made me lose interest in the important things in the movie which was the car chase.Thirdly, although the nuclear explosion was awesome and quite believable, Indy not being hurt from being tossed 1 to 2 miles bugged me. There was no other debris around him and he felt no ill effects from the radiation. If I was tossed that far in a metal box, I think I would be at least limping or had a broken arm. It was a nuclear explosion! Also, the Tarzan swinging Mutt (Henry Jones III) Williams completely irked me. This scene was so stupid, you might as well put a jet pack on his back and call him rocket man. Some may think that this was a cute scene, but listen, I like to see you swing from limb from limb and make it into a moving car that is speeding along a cliff.Other than that the movie would have scored higher, besides the few complaints I have, if it wasn't a generic screen play. I could guess what would happen next in almost every scene. But the action, the great acting, and the fact that I am a die hard Indiana Jones fan would definitely not score lower than a 7/10. If you go into this movie with no expectations to try to top the first three, then you will love the movie for what it is. If you have high expectations than your missing the point and are ""sh*t"" out of luck. I believe that there should be three Indiana Jones while he is young, and three with him old, but that's just me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

If B rated sci fis are your thing, then don't let me stop you. However, this is not the Indy's of the past, but a very blatant attempt to cash in on a franchise with a horrid script with more holes than swiss cheese.I'll put it another way if you need to.

1717,dylan-t_438,just as good as the originals,9,25 May 2008,"some people have been complaining that this episode in the Indiana Jones saga has been the worst in the series, which very well may be true, but it would not be by a long shot. some people have said the believability of this movie is too low for it to be enjoyable, i guess they forgot about the previous films with hearts being ripped out of chests and the holy grail bringing never ending life, and a messcherschmit sliding through a tunnel past Indy and henry, and the sheer number of times he has avoided death. my point is there is nothing in this movie that is less believable than something from a previous film (bar Indy surviving a nuclear blast, I won't say how). Lastly to the ones out there who accuse the writers of putting in lame jokes and bad one liners and say that it is a shame that they didn't stick to the true humor of the original three, you must be absolutely insane. If you have even seen raiders of the lost ark you know that the only humor in it is lame by todays standards but it is still funny. Spielberg probably decided it was best to stick to that version of the script instead of having it revised by the fellow who wrote 40 year old virgin and super bad,it wouldn't have been worth it just to appeal to todays audience. my point is that you have to go into this movie expecting it to be cheesy, you have to go in willing to forget the laws of physics for a while, you've done it before and you will be happy you did it for this movie as well. If you accomplish going into this movie ready to enjoy it and not looking for a laugh out loud funny movie that is also the most action packed movie of the century and also makes you cry, then you should be able to enjoy it.

1719,rjwardrop,sort of disappointed,6,23 May 2008,"it is now one day since i saw this film and my feeling of disappointment seems to grow with each passing hour. now before everyone starts saying I'm wrong and that i must be seeing raiders through rose tinted spectacles i know there are problems with the first 3 films ( i think raiders best crusade second best with temple not far behind), my problem with the fourth film is that it did not really feel like an Indy film i think i would of enjoyed it more if the characters had been someone else its just that the whole way through it i felt it did not really fit with the first three films i am not sure why could it be the baddies were Russians not Nazis(probably not as temple has thuggee cultists instead of Nazis). could it be Indy's sidekick mutt (surely not as annoying as short round). i think one of the reasons is that the George Lucas love of green screen can be seen through the film which looks like most of it was shot on sound stages and ruined the whole car chase sword fight in the jungle bit for me this scene fell well short of raiders truck in the dessert battle which as far as i know was mostly real stunt work. in fact the action scene that impressed me most was the bike chase through the university with the very very funny moment in the library to me that felt like a classic Indy moment. i felt sad at the loss of denholm elliot i do like the way they added his presence into the film . i think my main problem is i was quite happy with the trilogy and was quite happy going about my life knowing that it ended with the last crusade kingdom of skulls is not a bad film but it is not an Indy film n.b in the warehouse at start why when they shot at Indy were the bullets not magnetised to the crate??? surly would of been a better scene if when they all fired at Indy the bullets shot back at the crate behind them killing them as they passed:)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1720,c-n-turner,Indiana Jones - Big Deal,10,29 May 2008,"Indiana Jones is a big deal. The franchise is a very important one for movie fans. I, like many of you, consider it to be my favorite franchise, with Raiders of the Lost Ark being my favorite movie of all time. 19 years is a long time to wait for the next installment, and so we can't help but develop some expectations.That, however, is the problem. Expectations. with the disappointments that were the Star Wars prequels and the recently rebooted franchises like Batman and James Bond getting a more realistic approach, a lot of us seem to have forgotten what the old Indy flicks were really like.I'm tired of hearing people complain about how UNREALISTIC this movie is. UNREALISTIC? REALLY? Have you forgotten Indy hitching a ride on the outside of a submarine? Did you forget Driving alongside a burning airplane in a small tunnel? Or perhaps you have let slip the memories of EVERY action sequence from the Temple of Doom? From jumping from a plane in a rubber raft and sledding down a mountain, to dangling mere inches from a pool of lava and returning unscathed even though the cage's previous occupant burst into flames within ten feet of the lava. And let's not forget the mine cart chase.When Temple of Doom came out, people complained that it was too over the top and radically different from Raiders. When Last Crusade premiered, people complained at how toned down and how similar it was to Raiders. What do you want? Yet another historical Christian relic? the wrath of yet another god? Yes, Indy escapes a nuke. Yes, Mutt swings with the monkeys. Yes, there's an alien. And now people are complaining that the Crystal Skull is too UNREALISTIC and radically different from the other films.Well my friends, different is good. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is over-the-top fun and excitement with enough changes and excitement to keep it fresh and original, while containing enough of the whip-cracking nostalgia and deep dark tomb raiding to remind us all why we loved the last three pictures in the first place. And let me tell you, ol' Harrison Ford's still got it. He's the real reason for seeing the movie anyways, isn't he. To see him become our favorite archaeologist one more time is well worth the price of admission. Who really cares what other-worldly situations he finds himself in. The truth is we all still want to be him. Does he act exactly the way he did before? No. He acts exactly the way he would twenty years older, with a few of the qualities and mannerisms of Henry Jones Sr. showing through. One of my favorite parts of the movie was his reaction to seeing Marion for the first time. Also, a hilarious reminder of how much he hates snakes, which involves a sand pit and no ropes around to grab onto. And Indy, of course, still trusts all the wrong people.Look, if you want a better movie, go make one. Stop complaining about your expectations and disappointments and just enjoy Crystal Skull for what it is. Fun, and Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1721,ckeller-10,"Not ""Raiders"", but still Indy",6,22 May 2008,"I must say that I really tried to not have high expectations for this film. After all, how the hell are you going to top ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ? Answer? You cant!! Still this latest film has its moments even though the original magic of the previous films is missing. It seems as though Spielberg and Lucas were simply looking to have some fun and not take themselves too seriously, which shows, much to this fans dismay. Without giving away plot details I will say that while all of the films deal with a supernatural element, and that was expected, the Macguffin here was waaaaaaaay over the top! It just did'not fit! This doesn't even feel like an Indy sequel but rather a made for cable movie you might catch on the Disney channel. Harsh I know but this lifelong Indy fan ( I saw Raiders in the theater when I was seven) was bummed after walking out of this one. I read that Lucas' intent was to make a 50's B-movie like Attack of the Goofy-ass Alien Monster or some such nonsense, and boy did they succeed!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1722,maxgillman,Fits right in to the series,9,25 May 2008,"This latest installment of Indiana Jones was extremely fun. It had all the elements of the previous Indiana Jones movies. One element that the other three exploited well and that this one also achieved was the touching on the nature of the times. The 1950s-60s era was known as the atomic age as well as the greaser age and the movie used these topics to tie in little pieces of the plot quite nicely. Like Raiders and Co. used World War II as the centerpiece, KCS focused on the Cold War, making the story more interesting and the action for exciting. Some of the movie's lines were humorously cheesy, but looking back on the other three movies one realizes that those films had arguably an equally corny script but captured audiences based on the time period in which the film was made. This latest script hasn't flown with some of the general modern audience, but that is to be anticipated when the expectations were so over the top. Spielburg and crew perfectly blended all the qualities of a Jones movie into this one. All the sweet Indy-movie quirks are back; crazy and unsurvivable feats pulled off, snakes, insane sidekicks, bugs, the uber-whip, the indestructibility of the hat.....etc. Oh yeah, and the off-the-hook supernatural stuff that we love. The movie was exactly where it needed to be. Had it been made along with the other three and not 20 years later I'm sure many of the current skeptics views would change on this particular film.Ill admit that there are few parts of the movie that I didn't like, and thought were unnecessary, but in all Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an enjoyable thrill ride that puts proper closure to Harrison Ford's lovable character, and maybe opens the doors for a new one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1723,martyncolton999,Dear oh dear,1,2 June 2008,"Dear oh dear. Where do I begin? I am a huge fan of the original Indiana Jones Trilogy and so my excitement since finding out this was being made has been huge, my disappointment after watching it equally huge.I had read quite a lot about the film before going to see it, How great Cate Blanchett Russian accent was, how Indy still looked great after so long, how Spielberg and Lucas and had wanted to to stay in keeping with the original films in both terms of plot and style. None of this was true, the acting was terrible (Ray Winstone please stick to British gangster flicks, its all you are good for), the special effects looked like some kind of computer game gone wrong. Theplot was a mix of tomb raider meets any of the carry on films meets close encounters dressed up with the famous hat and whip. I know the first 3 films had there unreal moments with the arc and and the 1000 year old knights, but temples turning into trans dimensional alien spaceships, come on, this is Indiana Jones.Spielberg and Lucas have done them self an injustice releasing this. Harrison Ford looks like he was in it for one last bumper pay Day, the Russian accent was OK in places but in others she sounded like a Candian/Polish hybrid. Karen Allen should have given up acting after the first film.OK so I have skimmed over the bad points now to the good. Shia LeBouef was probably the highlight of the film, but he does not play the muscle well and should stick to the slightly nerdier character like his role in Transformers.There is one scene in the film when Lebouef's character Mutt gets catapulted into the treetops, he the starts swinging through the trees with an army of monkeys. At this point the cinema started to empty, and if I had not paid £15 to take my wife out for her birthday I would have joined them.To write such a bad review is sad because I really wanted to love this film. If you have nowhere to take your ten year old son on a rainy afternoon then this is ideal, but to be honest I doubt he will understand it.George, Steven, Harrison leave it alone now, for Indy's sake.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1724,thisissparta32,Unbelievably BAD!,1,23 May 2008,"My friend and I were completely shocked at how unbelievably bad this movie was. It was sooooo bad that we rushed home to have a drink and watch Temple of Doom in an effort to get the horrid memory of Crystal Skull out of our heads! And my opinion had nothing to do with the hype or the fact that I saw the originals when I was a kid. Spielberg and Lucas have really lost touch with reality if they think this is a good movie. It was bad on every level. And to top it all off, the crystal skull looked like a rubber Alien (the movie) head stuffed with cellophane. At one point they dropped it in some water and u could see the water inside the skull. Shocking! Sorry, guys.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1725,zak_moondust,"Without a doubt, the best adventure in the last 19 years.",10,25 May 2008,"Indiana Jones is back, and taking the adventure throne back from recent imitators like National Treasure and Pirates of the Caribbean.For starters, the action set pieces are nothing short of amazing. Without spoiling anything, I can say that Indy visits a wide variety of locations and manages to destroy all of them with the trademark everyman plausibility that we love from the character. The cast is surprisingly small, but the new characters are all very well developed, from Cate Blanchett's villainous Irina Spalko to Shia LaBeouf's spunky and likable Mutt Williams. Returning characters don't really need to be developed; we already know who they are, no need to refresh our memories.The story is everything one would probably expect: Indy chases an object around the world, racing against rival archaeologists as well as rival government forces. Russian Communists step up to fill the boots of the German Nazis, which works just fine. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull impresses on so many levels. The musical score is epic as ever, the special effects never get in the way of the AMAZING stunt work (a certain action sequence, involving trucks, swords, rocket launchers, and large bugs is quite possibly the most exciting action sequence in the entire series), and the story, involving the titular crystal skull, works perfectly. Indy, it feels so good to have you back. Just please, don't make us wait 19 more years for the next adventure!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1726,ddeadboyclub,It wouldn't have surprised me.........(may contain spoilers),2,24 May 2008,Let me say first that I love all the Indy films and was pretty excited to see this one. But whew- was I wrong! Maybe I'm a little harsh but having two of the greatest film makers of our generation coming up with this regurgitation of a film is inexcusable. I know its a fantasy film but please have a little realism so that I can be drawn in. Indy surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge thats thrown a mile away? Monkeys attacking the bad guys only? Bullet ants carrying away a grown man? Ohh let me not forget Indy and Mutt (ha ha both dog names- what did it take 15 years to think of that?) talking about the Mitchell-hedges skull but when they get into the tomb all the skulls are the same. Wtf? I wouldn't been surprised if JAR JAR BINKS came in looking for some screen time. OHH THE HUMANITY!!! Please don't tarnish the Wild One film having Shia riding in looking like Brando.

Let me say this may contain spoilers...But @ this point almost all of these will, and a great deal of the reviews are all so close w/ ratings...The Start: It starts out w/ that same Indy WANT, same cinematic grainy 1980's film feel. Then the hat comes out! YESS Awesome!! It builds it up for you to say, "" HELL YES!!"", and up until the traveling starts to S. America it leaves you wanting a little more action and less talking.The Middle: Don't get me wrong I know Harrison Ford is up there in yrs, but I just couldn't shake the feeling of, I miss the young Indy! The esquepades, the lines, the moves! It just didn't have the same feel. It was like he was being led on a leash the whole time. It had some good action, the regular ""kill all the bad guys in a crazy way"" (Rocket Burn!!!) and the narrow escapes, but I still couldn't get used to the new digital filming in this movie and the CG. I didn't like it. I miss the grainy old style film, WHICH is possible w/ the new dig. cameras as well, they just chose not to. It always had a sound-stage feel to it, which made it not believable in my book. The fight scenes were over the top and the CGI took away from the picture and wasn't necessary!! (rant:Why do they ruin such good movies w/ worthless CG!) The end: It was okay... I expected the idea, and I am sure many of use believe that the elongated heads of the past Meso-American peoples in their worship to their gods, are of course ALIEN worshipers! I expected it! Does it look like Indiana Jones may have a new squire in his mits? Will his son take over the father's crazy antics? Only Lucas and Speilburg knows! If so, I want the old feel back, but the Red Commies don't match up to the Blood thirsty Nazi in my book.. and I miss them, (the villains NOT the MOVEMENT!) Over all I did expect more!

So, I had a great expectation to see this movie, I even bought the ticket one week in advance.The film started and I thought: OK... not bad but maybe things will improve soon. At the end, I felt quite disappointed. Here are my main points: - the plot is predictable and has lots of errors (e.g. the natives seemed to be hibernating endlessly, just waiting for people to arrive and then kill them? Does this make any sense? How about the gift from the aliens? What was it? - some actors/actresses have bad performances, even Harrison Ford on some scenes - the mighty Steven Spielberg failed to give an interesting, overtaking movie, just fast CGI sequences, some of them with few reality credibility. There is no climax and the way the movie ends (a wedding???) looks more like a cheap novel than anything else.I would expect a more impressive story, that could be read at several levels, for kids and adults, like the incredibles. But no, this is a movie just for teenagers and of course fans that accept everything.At the end, I felt like I just wasted my money, it would be better if this movie was not made, but of course, the big bucks must arrive...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1729,dukeslighthouse,what can you say?,2,23 May 2008,"** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS** I love the Indy series, and I love many of Spielberg's films, so I'm not one of those guys who's out there to trash this movie just to trash it, as Lucas would like you to think. I truly went in hoping to view a good, fun film. I wasn't expecting another classic Raiders. Not even a Last Crusade. My expectations were fair. Not high. Not low. Just fair. Even so, I was left disappointed.I know the people involved in this film might say that I just ""didn't get it"" or ""nothing they could make would be good enough"". I think that's a cop out. I just wanted a good film. Period. This 4th installment had a different tone/style than the previous three. Okay, fine. I'll live with that, but it just flat out didn't work. It had no heart, no central theme, no spark between any of the characters. I mean, NOTHING. It was just a garbled collection of big stunts and zany one liners. Indy's character itself was so far detached from anything we've seen before that it just lost me from the get go. I found myself asking, who is this guy? And I'm sorry, but when people start swinging through the jungle like Tarzan w/ a squadron of cute monkeys (who seem to hate the villains as much as we're supposed to...) you've just lost a good part of your audience. Well, at least you lost me. I'm not three years old and I don't need to be spoon fed crap like that. Whatever happened to making films that would entertain people of all ages? Now this is not to say there aren't enjoyable parts in the film. It certainly looked great. For the money they spent, they'd damn well hit at least SOME high notes, but overall, it completely failed to engage me in any way. The script was terrible and the direction (which stems from the script, which I think we all know Spielberg and Ford didn't love) was misguided. It brought us characters we love, and made them into clowns. See for yourself if you don't believe me.All in all, though the powers that be had to comprise on what this Indy should be to get the film made at all (thanks to Lucas, who seems to love alienating his fans and tainting his classics), they simply came up with a film that was entirely misguided to begin with. Despite their best efforts, they couldn't cover that up. Sadly, I hear a lot of younger kids complaining afterwards, putting much of the blame on Harrison Ford himself. He's too old, they said. Wrong! He was not the problem. His direction was the problem. The lines he was given were the problem. The same goes for all the cast. They just didn't have much to work with. Who's to say where the blame should fall. Probably on a few different people's shoulders, but if you don't have a good script to begin with, you're certainly starting things off in a tough spot.

1730,jonneal16,Indiana 4 has still got it.,3,23 May 2008,"I have a great admiration for the Indy franchise, even if at sometimes we question the events in the films, we have got to take into account what these films stood for, and are still standing for.Lucas and Spielberg set out to simply entertain an audience, thrill them, and make them want to be that character. They did it for me, even with this film. Indy 4 is a perfect example of strictly ENTERTAINMENT movie making. They're not trying to make you focus on story, or plot, because we already know what its going to be. In every film he's out to find an artifact/treasure hunting, and this one's no different. It's just another Indy adventure. Remember that.In retrospect, just think about the other Indy films, and seriously compare this one to them. Really compare it. Will you find it to be much different? NO. We just have to remember that this one's made 19 years later, when technology is at it's peak. The movie business is changing for better, or worse. But you still get the feeling of old fashion tricks, and you get it.I'm not knocking anybody, and certainly not those who hated this film. There were elements in the film that needed changing definitely. The scenes with the monkey's, the atomic bomb and the fridge, and the boat scenes with the waterfalls. They could have made it a little more realistic/not over the top. And the dialogue, not the story, could have been better.However, I am still blown away by the adventures of Indy. Nothing can compare the movie experience of Indiana Jones, especially in a theater. I don't care who you are. If you've grown up with the franchise as I have, and can appreciate the pure adventure part of Indiana Jones. You will definitely be more than satisfied with Crystal Skull.And, be nice to Steven and George.

Did anyone els find it strange that the characters were able to talk normally in high speed car chases when they should of been shouting. Did anyone else think that at least one of the thousands of shots fired at indie, one would of hit him? And what a terrible, terrible antagonist. All she did was put on a scary face and say as many one liners as Indie. The action scenes were stolen from other films, like the ants. Does the Mummy come to mind? Or the waterfalls, overused and in this case, boring. Somehow Indies son, Yes, Son, manages to outrun a jeep by vine swinging with monkeys and I haven't even touched upon the aliens or the nuclear explosion.Granted, it captured the look and theme of its era but thats not what we wanted. The jump from historical artifacts to aliens is not what we wanted. So I'm just going to pretend this film never happened.

Harrison Ford got back into character and it was nice to see Karen Allen again. the other supporting actors also did a fantastic job. I enjoyed the references to the previous three films such as the arc, Marcus's statue, how Indy was helped by a monkey again, and the picture of his father. the ending was my favorite part and one of the best moments in any of the films when Mutt almost put on the hat.

IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, THERE IS STILL ONLY 3 INDIANA JONES FILMS. It is pure garbage, the action is so ridiculous that it is more annoying than entertaining. It is as if they had no script and made up for it by coming up with all these actions scenes that look like your watching a video game with all the CGI. Lucas and Spielberg lost what was brilliant about the original three and have given us a sloppy mess with terrible (and at times excruciating) dialog. Not even the great Harrison Ford could save this script (ie ""They weren't you baby"" and ""Their treasure was knowledge""). No actor can get any credit because they have nothing to work with. And the sets and outfits don't pass for the period, they look more like costumes then actual 50's style clothing.When it comes down to it the film is far inferior to the others and ends up being another unnecessary sequel that most viewers will not consider it as being a part of the originals.

Needless to say, I was up to my ears with excitement for this film, right away I knew it would not be the same, but I could not foresee just how bad it really was going to be.The films opening was so different from the originals, in all of the first three films Indy is off on some crazy adventure at the beginning. Crystal Skull begins with a car ""race"" to Elvis's ""Hound dog"", the chase has NOTHING to do with the rest of the film. so right off the bat I knew I was not seeing just another Jones film.Cate Blanchette played a very boring villain (fitting to the other characters in the film) I honestly did not care if she lived or died compared to other villains such as Belloch whose head I wanted to explode (and it did!). Mutt Williams was also just awful. I loved Shia in Transformers but he was awful in this film, and when I found out how he is related to Dr. Jones, I almost died. Karen Allen had an OK performance, and Ford carried the movie.Other complaints include the car chase, the sword fight between Mutt and Irina, the giant ants, the nuclear explosion (and how Indy survives) and the whole FBI investigating Indy deal. But most of all, was the magnetic field that things created in the film. I loved how lights 50 feet in the air would be pulled towards the skull, yet the guns on the backs of the soldiers carrying it were not affected at all... c'mon Spielberg! With weak characters, a horrible plot, and sequences that were just laughable, this is defiantly the worst of the 4 films and does not even deserve the title of Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1738,BrianJMcGrath,Is there such a thing as TOO over-the-top?,7,22 May 2008,"I've loved Indiana Jones since the beginning. Not since the beginning of the franchise, because I was not yet born--but the beginning of my life. The first movie my parents took me to see was Temple of Doom (I was 2), and the rest, as they say, is history. I loved everything about these movies. The fun, the tongue-in-cheekiness, the stories, the characters, and of course, the action!Everybody loves Raiders for its breakneck pace and flawless storytelling. Temple of Doom doesn't get as much love, many criticizing Kate Capshaw's character and the dark tone; although I LOVE the film. Most fondly remember the Last Crusade for many reasons: the father-son relationship, the humor, and the compelling plot devices. And while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has received generally favorable nods, I can't quite echo the sentiments of these people in relation to the rest of the series.Don't get me wrong, it IS a fun movie. I especially enjoyed the first half or so. The action was a bit more low-key (although not much) than the rest of the movie, the stunt-work was more impressive, and it generally had more of a sense of fun. Once the chase really sets in is where I lost a little interest.The latter half of the movie had its moments, but the humor wasn't quite there, and the plot wasn't well-enough-developed for my taste, although I appreciated George's concept. One scene, in particular, REALLY miffed me, and well, let's just say you never would have guessed that Shia LaBeouf could be Tarzan-reincarnate. Oh, and the river scene was TOO much, as well. I also didn't appreciate the amount of CGI used, even after Spielberg said he would use as little as possible. CGI groundhogs and monkeys? As GOB Bluth would say, ""COME ON!""The movie does have a lot of redeeming qualities, and it is well worth your two hours and $10. But as one reviewer has stated, I never felt that Indy was in any REAL danger, and the humor just isn't quite there.

It would be impossible to make a film better or equal to Raiders or even Last Crusade and anyone who is expecting that is expecting too much. Little CGI is used intentionally to make it appear as if it was shot shortly after Last Crusade and it worked out nicely. It was fun, humorous and entertaining, exactly what you would expect. The acting was superb on all counts, even Shia, who many critics thought looked out of place. The action was very similar to the other Indiana Jones flicks. It may seem a little outlandish at times and works out in Indy's favor, but thats what we were expecting and its entertaining to say the very least.

I believe Lucas and Spielberg wrote the script in some fast food greasy lost-in-time restaurant, thinking about how much money they could get instead of creating an intelligent adventure story. I fell asleep in the theater... The bad: - Ridiculous jungle-tarzan scene -The Russian Irina: was a very poor character and has nothing of psychic. -Professor Ox: I know he was nuts, but, can you create a more interesting crazy old man? -Damn boring action scenes -The whole script was very confusing and lazy. -when Indiana Jones realizes he is a father. This scene is so shallow and emptyThe good -Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones -Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood -The beginning, when you can see a glimpse of the ark -The ending, when the movie ends, ha ha -Karen AllenWell, that's all!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1741,rreeman,"Dear Mr Spielberg, you are better than this!",1,29 November 2008,"This isn't so much a review as a plea to several people behind this film.To David Koepp:you have enough credits to your name to suggest you know a thing or two more about screen writing than I do but I sensed there was a little something missing from your script...RESEARCH1. Gunpowder is not magnetic 2. Lead is not magnetic 3. Pancho Villa was Mexican and would not have known an Incan dialect. I won't even mention the fridge.Perhaps you decided that the story you'd been handed by Mr. Lucas & Mr. Nathanson was so ridiculous that there was no reason for you not to play around with history and/or the laws of physics. If so, I understand and appreciate what you were trying to do. Which leads me...To George Lucas:by the time the aliens show up the intelligent viewer has concluded either that this film was made in a separate dimension where history followed an alternate course, the geography of central and south America became entirely scrambled and the physical properties of base metals and compounds are different to our own ORthat some time after completing Return Of The Jedi you suffered a nasty bang on the head leaving you mentally impaired.Despite being open to possibility, I'm not entirely convinced of the former. Also, the fact that it's easier to find artistic integrity and lasting appeal in the scribblings of a retard than in your recent works leads me to believe it's not the latter.So what happened?Yours Sincerely, Richard ReemanR.S.V.P.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1742,keh208,Why does everyone hate this film?,8,29 December 2008,"Indy 4 is a perfectly good film, the acting is spot on, the direction while not ground-breaking, is certainly acceptable, and considering the gap between it and its prequels I was pleasantly surprised.After reading many reviews the main issue that people seem to take with the film is its plot, but if you look at the other Indy films: The Holy Grail; the cup that Jesus himself drank out of giving whoever drinks from it the power of immortality, or the Ark of the Covenant melting Nazis alive, or even voodoo rituals allowing the removal of somebody's heart without surgery: COME ON PEOPLE aliens are right up Indy's street.After considering this it became clear that people don't have a problem with this movie, the problem is that before they even saw the film they decided it wasn't going to be as good as the other Indy movies, so they picked every little hole in the film they could find: the plot is unbelievable, the stunts are too over the top etc.The fact of the matter is, if you genuinely don't like this film the chances are you don't like Indiana Jones in the first place, but if you liked the predecessors you should love this film if you see it with an open mind!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1743,unregistered-coward,This was the best script they had after 19 years?,6,26 May 2008,"Indy 4. I wouldn't go so far as to describe the movie as putrid, that right is reserved for movies like Alien 4. This movie just wasn't good. You could have taken Harrision Ford out and substituted Chuck Norris for a FireWalker II.It just didn't have a pace to it, we seemed to be frantically moving from one scenario to another trying to set up callbacks to previous Indy movies. And while we had the occasional hard to swallow plot device in the previous movies (Indy on the sub, Indy jumps from the plane), they still had a bit of believability to them. This movie just took us into the realm of truly unreasonable.Five words could sum the movie upRefrigerator Tarzan Niagara Ants Greys",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1744,pihoosunn,This should of never been made,1,25 May 2008,"I have only given this a star due to the fact of Cate Blanchett as I felt so sorry for her starring in this... I don't know how to describe it, if it was the money for her kudos but what actress of her calibre would put themselves thru this?As far as 'spoilers' for this movie it was an insult to anyone's intellect that George 'I have ruined Star Wars and now Indiana Jones' Lucas, David 'I haven't written anything good since Panic Room' Koepp and Steven 'Disillusioned by grandeur's of his own ego' Spielberg, could ever conceive this would be enjoyed by anyone but themselves is beyond me and it makes me think what was so wrong with Frank Darabont's script that they would choose this of that.Now as far as Harrison Ford he looks plastic and happy to be in his character but not with the script. John Hurt was wasted, Ray Winestone I don't even know what he was doing in this, Shia LaBeouf who has absolutely no talent like Orlando Bloom, and that whole son thing was like putting your finger in already leaking dam & Karen Allen who should have stayed in retirement or oblivion.The story of the Alien with the Mayans I thought was a good concept but the whole story and script need a lot of work. I am sad to say they should of left this one on the shelf and thought maybe we don't need another Indy film, but any money that Lucas and Spielberg make of this I hope every cent of it doesn't make them happy as it made me as I keep hitting my head on the seat in front of me in disgust at how people can ruin a franchise with the stoke of a pen. Even the one lines in it where disgusting, can some explain to me the gopher thing please.John William's score was very uneventful like most of them lately he has done, milking the Raiders theme all the way thru it, because you can't come up with any thing new doesn't make it a score.All in all this is a terrible movie worthy of Uwe Boll, I will never ever talk or watch this Indiana Jones film, I will stick to the first trilogy of films and I will be content with that.God Help us all if they make any more including Shia LaBeouf as the lead like George Lucas has threatened us with.And Sean Connery please give yourself a pat on the back for never appearing or associating yourself with this film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

How many Indy movies can you have the plot circle around a religious artifact? It was refreshing to see something new for a change. As far as Roswell and the alien plot it fit perfect for the time 1957.When you think about it no Indy movie has had a real deep story,it's always been about the action and thrills. As soon as the lights went down and the familiar theme song started I was in bliss. And the way Indy was introduced in the movie was brilliant. I went to this movie hoping to escape for two hours and I loved every minute of Indiana Jones and The Kingdom Of The Crystal Scull.Grab some popcorn and enjoy the ride!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1746,spacecowboy1992,i don't see why it was so bad,8,21 June 2008,this movie was just as i would have expected and better it did not have a feeble Harison Ford struggling to walk let alone handle an action scene or have more crappy cgi than Micheal bay could ever dream of. What i saw was a trip into the past taken back to when i was five years old finding mum and dads old Indy video tapes and being amazed swept up in the magic of it all. By far it is no raiders but it still very much Indy i know. Most critics are saying the movie was a failure because of its alien plot. I was not bothered at all by it i felt it was handled tastefuly and also this more is one of Shia LaBeouf better than in the failures that were transformers and irobot and disturbia this movie deserves at least a 7 or an 8,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1747,sigovorin,"Less than expected, goofier than needed",4,22 May 2008,"I don't think this movie is on the same tier as the previous ones. The story seemed desperate for attention, resulting in Jones' long lost love and son, a betrayal of a good friend, a retraction of that betrayal, a reenactment of the same betrayal, and finally, the death (or enlightening?) of the double-betrayer. Most everything having to do with animals was excessive and cheesy, the least cheesy interjection of animals was the snake (each movie HAS to have at least one.) The Prairie Dogs (or whatever they are) could have been nixed entirely since they were just a cheap gimmick, and the monkeys and ants are just too far over the edge.The main story line could have been acceptable, but i find few redeeming qualities in the ""They're just aliens that crystallize when one is missing"" argument.This movie had so much potential, especially with Cate Blanchett as the antagonist. I feel that the movie did not live up to my expectations as an enjoyable movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1748,leo-405,Much like the Holy Grail.... Indy should have been laid to rest.,1,22 May 2008,"I went to see Indiana Jones at an advanced screening (at 1 minute past midnight on its UK release day). I would happily admit I was already sceptical as to resurrecting a film series that had been left alone for 19 years.However few things would have prepared me for what I would be submitted to over the next couple of hours. It had all the elements of Indy, but was somehow lacking hugely. I won't divulge the plot, but ask that people consider how much they need to see this film.It started out well, humour, stunts.... a beautifully shot opening scene. However after that Spielburg took us on a tour of disconnected strands, loosely tied together by relying on flimsy use of Indy iconography. Harrison is no-longer the young, rugged hero, and instead Shia la Boef, (who actually does well in his character and is one of the best elements of the film) steals the show and the parts where Indy should step up.I only wish that the end of Last Crusade, when they ride off into the sun-set, marked the end of Indy. I shall simply have to ignore the fact that a forth film exists, the original three were so, so good.The tomb of Indy should be left alone, for that way danger lies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1749,ijones-1,Kicked in the teeth,1,18 June 2008,"Why did I allow myself to get excited about this movie? I had already been brutally let down by Lucas when he vomited out the Star Wars prequels, but still I felt Indiana Jones 4 could bring back the magic of the previous fabulous movies.Sadly there were only glimpses of the old magic. Indy getting chased over the crates at the start of the movie was the highlight, a nice big stunt with no use of CGI that I could see. Yes Indy looked old but he made up for it by poking fun at himself when missing a jump. His humour brought back all his charm and charisma for that short second.The rest of the film was very very poor. I really didn't like the plot and the script.Harrison Ford looked very feeble which was quite depressing but redeemed himself occasionally with good humour.Shia LaBouf was OK I thought. I see others have more of a problem with him.Karen Allen is back as Marion but tended to annoy more then add value to the film. the worst being a stupid scene where she suicidally drives a car off a cliff with everyone screaming at her to stop but she ploughs on with a big silly grin on her face. The escape from that scene was ludicrous as anyone who has watched the film will tell you.Ray Winstone playing Mac was also a character that annoys. Why Indy would want to save him at the end only Lucas would know.I guess my main gripes are; Poor quest compared to the older film with a silly Sci-Fi ending.Ridiculously unbelievable stunts and escapes that insult your intelligence. try and keep one foot in reality please.Obcene over use of CGI.So in conclusion this wont meet the standard I need to even consider this to be part of the Indy series. They are my favourite films of all time and I can't believe this is the best Lucas and Spielberg could come up with. The IMDb score is too high and does those two too much credit, thus my 1 score.Shame on you both.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1751,bp-68,B-movie? - Practical alchemy! -> How to turn junk into gold!,5,31 May 2008,"Fortunately I have not expected too much of this film, although there was some hope to see a solid, professionally made Blockbuster movie with some entertainment quality. However, even assuming a shallow plot in the first place it must be seen as a piece of art to hammer so much loosely interconnected ideas together with the appearance of an electronically enhanced living-room size set and get so many people pay for their tickets. Or is it just a sign that customers are more attracted by the gloom of successful namer, rather than quality. In the end one might say this is a great demonstration of how the American advertisement industry can turn junk into gold.Just for the ""non-believers"": This film was rather a social event, but all the 9 people that have seen it only had one comment: crap - nothing else - no plot (no we are not going to space, we are going to the space in between), no interesting scenes, no great or even convincing acting, no big jokes (rather than the unrealistic decisions and physics together with the flaws in lighting as well as the poor settings and background acting - which was exceptionally bad BTW), not even interesting special effects. Even placing the Russians as the big environmental killers (which they are) next to the nature and peace loving Americans is even politically questionable.

1752,roqueslaurence,"He is back, and in GREAT form!",1,26 May 2008,"I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull at the midnight showing and boy was it good. The original feel was back, but with a twist of 50's and sci-fi. I enjoyed this film immensely. It was like all the Indiana Jones movies combined with with this new era involved all giving it some serious originality. Hats off to Harrison, Steven, George, and the rest of the gang.I will welcome this new installment in my Indy collection gladly.Please don't listen to the haters of this film, they know not of what they speak. GO SEE THIS FILM! Indy IV = 10/10As for the realism of the Indy 4, well it isn't realisticBut when have any Indiana Jones film been realistic? And what would be the fun in a realistic Indy film? People who thought the ""mutt swinging with monkeys"" scene was weird are clearly to stupid to comprehend the comedy about it. They were grease-monkeys!! And Mutt Williams was a greaserwhich were often called grease-monkeys! I thought that scene was very funny. The people who hate this film are only attention seeking dimwits. They went into the theaters and got something they didn't expect. Something original. It still has the old school Indy feel to it, but with a bit of freshness. The Aliens? well, was the ""wrath of god/ghosts"" coming out of the Ark in the first Indy any less weird? Or was the rail cart race at the end of Temple any less realistic than most scenes in this film? What about the knight in the last Crusade who stayed alive for 500 years? How about heads melting and exploding in the first Indy. Or the Hearts being ripped out in the second. How about seagulls taking down a Nazi jet fighter. (don't get me wrong, I love those scenes) I'm a hardcore Indiana Jones fan, and have been since I was a little kid. I love all of them and have seen them countless times. And have been waiting for this movie for years. When I finally got to see it I thought is was totally awesome, the humor and self irony of some scenes were right on! Indiana Jones has aged like a good wine. And the movie builds on that. making him more clumsy than the previous films, which only adds to the comedy. The movie now takes place in the 50's which is the era of American drag racing, milkshakes and hot rods. And let's not forget ""war of the worlds"", ""The day the earth stood still"" ""Invasion of the Body snatchers"". It was the era of science fiction, monster movies and nuclear fear, which makes the nuclear test area scene and the alien twist on the series so much more likable. And it does this while still maintaining the original look and feel of an Indiana Jones movie. Now, it seems the critics love this movie, we just need these whiney complainers to shut up and just enjoy the film! When Temple of Doom came out this was all the same, people didn't think Indiana Jones worked in a sort of ""horror"" environmentand Indy 4...people don't think the sci-fi mix works. People eventually started liking TOD and I know a TON of people LOVE this new film but there are still the jerks who are simple minded so let me say, more and more people/fans will come to love this Indiana Jones adventure though the years.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

And it even has a flying saucer!!! The action, locations, actors, the jokes are great but the alien stuff just ruined it for me... Oh. And the Nazis have been replaced by communists.

I didn't think the Russians worked as well as the Nazis in being the bad guys, but what else are you going to do when it's set in the late 50's?Shia was great BTW.

1755,Alx21,A great adventure movie.... but not a great Indiana Jones movie,7,25 May 2008,"This movie is quite good, better than ""Temple of Doom"" I think, but it cannot be compare to the magic of ""Last Crusade"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".It is very disappointing that, after almost 10 years working on the story, the screenplay doesn't seem perfect. It almost looks like a first draft but not a final work. I will be very curious to have a look at Frank Darabont's Indiana Jones 4 screenplay, just to compare...Good : - Harrison Ford IS still Indy (and it is so great to see him back) - The warehouse sequence is great as well as the motorbike chase (they are the two action sequence where the MAGIC is really back) - The meeting between Mutt and Indy - The ""professor"" Jones scenes - The Henry Jones Sr and Marcus Brody ""cameo"" - The rock n' roll songs - In fact, the whole ""USA"" first part of the movie is quite good - Marion is back :) - The snake and the quicksand scene - The sword fight - Shia LaBeouf is a great choice - The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski is stunning - The movie is quite entertaining Bad : - CGI animals (ants, monkeys...) - The Russian are not very frightening (bring the Nazi back !! even if we are the 50's) - It seems quite easy to find the Crystal Skull - There is NO suspense, once Indy has the skull we are not really afraid of what might happen if the Russian take it, if fact the skull doesn't seem powerful whereas the Lost Ark was quite scary... and it's just a box !! - The ""Mummy""like ants scene - Poor John Hurt as a stupid silly character - Karen Allen is overacting - Indiana is not the main character in the jungle sequence (who cares of Mutt, we want to see Indy), and doesn't get very much solo screen time - Mac is better as a good guy (as a Sallah like character) - The 3 waterfalls - I don't want to see the alien... I want to imagine them... the less we see the better (remember the end of Raiders) - The music is not the best of John Williams works - Where is the whip ? - Henry Jones Jr is rarely called ""Indiana"" or ""Indy"" :( - The last third is quite boring...Nevertheless, I know Mr Steven Spielberg can do better and I am really waiting for an INDIANA JONES 5 (2011 ??) for this... but not a Shia LaBeouf movie, the main character must be Harrison Ford :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1756,alexandersapphiredestiny,Indy's Back!,8,21 May 2008,"A lot of people are going to walk away from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and absolutely hate it. Why? I'm not sure. It was utterly predictable and cheesetastic. Had it not have been, then everyone who worked on it would have failed. That is the beauty of Indiana Jones, and other films like it. It is meant to be predictable, but more importantly it is meant to be fun and exciting.Cate Blanchett had a superb Russian accent; and I was enthralled with the sword fight between her and Shia LaBeouf. It was so awesome! They did an excellent job with the visual effects and keeping them quite near the same as they were twenty-seven years ago, when Raiders of the Lost Ark was released.I do not think that it was the best Indiana Jones films, but it was definitely exciting and well worth (just two days shy of) a nineteen-year wait. My personal favourite is the Last Crusade.Shia LaBeouf once again proved himself to be an excellent actor. He is definitely one of the few superior actors of this generation.It was great to see the famous hat back in action. It was equally exciting to hear Jones's famous one-liners again: ""Sister"", ""I've got a bad feeling about this.""The concept of the Crystal Skulls was outstanding. I loved that they took the legendary tale of the Skulls and elaborated on it more and twisted it ever so slightly.All in all, it was basically amazing! Only the true Indiana Jones fans will walk away with a warm, fuzzy feeling that has been missing for nearly two decades. It is safe to say, that I am very excited for the fifth and final chapter in the Indiana Jones saga. Hopefully, there won't be another twenty year gap for that, though, otherwise Harrison Ford WILL be 80 years old.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1757,carmengonzalezh,A little more respect,4,25 May 2008,"The expectations about the fourth movie of the series were high and they were frustrated. Many of moviegoers complain about the locations, the poor quality of the special effects and many other things. I want to refer us to another thing that is more important to me, as a Latinamerican History teacher: the inaccurate history data.The worst was, by far, when professor Jones said that in Pancho Villa's army were people that spoke Quechua. I know that for many US citizens Latin America is an homogeneous cultural area. That is probably the reason why the writers of this story thought that Maya could possibly had lived and built a city in the Amazon rain forest, thousand kilometers far away, and many centuries ago, from the place and time where and when Maya lived; that Quechua people could had been fought in Mexican Revolution and that Belice existed before 1981, when this British colony in Guatemala territory declared its independence.I didn't expect that Mr. Lukas or Mr. Spielberg lectured us about Latin America history. I think they had other things may be more important to do. Although, I hoped they showed, as the last one did in Schindler's list, the same respect about the history of the rest of the world. I think that wasn't too much to expect, considering that there are 562 millions of Latino people living in 20 countries bellow Río Grande, and 45.5 million of Hispano people living in the USA.I hope you don't think that I am a spoiler (I am not) because I had spoken my mind.

1758,Harkers007,Welcome Back Dr. Jones,6,23 May 2008,"Well... all I can say is... WOW! This Indiana Jones Film is easily one of the best in the franchise. I love it from start to finish. Harrison Ford still proves that he is the right man for the job, certainly he's a little older, a little wiser... but he is still the same kick ass action hero he always was and always will be! Firstly. I love Indys introduction, its absolutely perfect as he has been greatly missed for 19 years. The only problem I have with Harrison is that his line delivery sounds like that of a video game character, though., I'm glad to say, his presence and charm pulls it off. I really do not think the writing is weak at all, yeah it has its moments but who cares, this is not meant to have a deep meaning, this is meant to be a light hearted, action adventure movie, and it certainly lives up to expectations. For Example. In CRUSADE. I didn't care about the quest for the holy grail, I just watched it for the entertainment and how Indy got to it. The same goes for this SKULL.. I'm going to be completely honest here, i just watch Indiana Jones to be entertained, its not like Bond where I think the character should have real emotional depth, but I have to admit that I did love the moments in the previous three when Indy did show some humanity. Nothing else I can say really. Great Music... I love how Williams reused the 'Flight from Peru' Track from Raiders. I'm beginning to warm greatly to the score since I have seen it in action. Great moments of humour, most notably Indy tripping over the dummy's in the Nuclear Test Centre and his quip ""Yeahh sure don't wait for me!!"" as he is running after the jeep. I loved the whole Fridge scene, though it did look like an out of control TARDIS flying through the sky, The Quicksand Scene was rather amusing as was the whole call the snake a rope charade. The Only problem I had with it was that I felt that it was over to soon, It needed to be longer. Anywhay...Great Action and Supporting Actors, nothing else I can say really - I Loved INDY IV.

It looks as if they wanted to make this movie so CGI that it took away from the story oh that's right what story. What I'm trying say is movies can be better even action. But this is just one movie that you love or you hate. By the way I do not hate Indy films but they need to stop making them or it's going to hurt what the movies stand for fun. On top of that I hope this is the last one. So all and all it was OK but not my cup of tea.

It wasn't supposed to be a comedy movie and it sucked big time in that area too, due to weak plot and over-acting. The action was repetitive, unnecessarily stretched and unrealistic to the point that it seemed even worse than a animated movie with lots of special effects and situations of perils and near death experiences in which the actors showed no expression of fear or excitement to move the audience. Everything about this movie was so unsatisfying, even worse it's hateful, Simply put I'm too angry at losing my money, my valuable time and hopes on a experience which will take me some time to get over with....

AWW. thats fine. what happens next? mutt stars SWINGING ON VINES TARZAN STYLE! and what else? ALL THE EFFING MONKEYS ARE SWINGING WITH HIM!! so mutt skillfully swings his way back to the cars that are going 60 or so MPH and jumping onto it to get the skull back from the lady. and he does with ease because he has help FROM ALL THE GD MONKEYS WHO HAVE JUMPED ON THE CAR AS WELL TO ATTACK THE WOMAN...the characters were not very good. Anne was a bit off and seemed to fall for Jones' one-liner pret-ty fast for leaving her pregnant at the alter and never hearing from him.At the beginning in the warehouse Jones throws the gunpowder and it flies off like a hound to the crate. any magnetic force that powerful would have been noticeable by all the metal equipment the soviets had. if it can draw metal from that distance in the air they would have felt themselves being pulled towards it. NTM the powder would not have flown above the crates but would have been drawn directly to the box at an angle from Indy's hand. when they get it open every now and then something gets stuck to the box and is pried of with relative ease considering THE MAGNET CAN PULL TRACE METAL IN GUNPOWDER FROM HUNDREDS OF YARDS.IJ:KCS overall was unreal even for a movie. the acting and directing was good but Lucas ultimately ruined it as bad as he did for starwars. Though the movie had its moments most was garbage compared to the other 3 movies. Lucas should have remembered that indiana Jones is about archeology and mythology, not about flying saucers and aliens.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1763,jona100-1,Not everyone is going to get it,10,7 June 2008,"To be fair Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was not the best of the series. It was not the best film that I have seen this year. It wasn't even in the top five best films I have seen this year. However, as a life long fan of Indiana Jones I can give it its due. In fact even though it wasn't the best film I have seen this year, it was probably the funnest and most enjoyable film I have seen this year. Is that because I am a die hard Indy fan? Probably so. I can quote almost every line from the first 3 films, and I have fond memories of watching these films with my father. The best thing about this film? Indiana Jones. You can beat that not with all of the Iron Man in Hollywood. Ford comes shinning through and every minuet of this film is fun to watch. At the end of the film I over heard tow high school age girls talking. ""I just don't get it, what's all the talk about"". Well to be honest I don't think a lot of people will get it. But I think this one was made for the fans and if you didn't like, you probably wouldn't get it either.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1764,justin-long519,Close but no cigar,5,20 May 2008,"(Spoilers) Halfway through this movie I thought, hey this could compete with Last Crusade for 3rd place in the series. The movie is just not that great though. A lot of potential exists but the movie falls flat in the last act. The good stuff: Harrison Ford pretty much pulled off Indiana Jones again, he's obviously much older but doesn't take away from the movie. Shia is a welcome addition to the series, I would not be opposed to Indy 5 with him taking over the role and Harrison doing the Sean Connery thing like Lucas proposed. Karen Allen almost saves this movie. When she enters the screen a huge smile lit up my face just like hers and for the next 20 mins she steals the scenes...then she disappears for 10 mins through the action sequence and inexplicably just returns out of nowhere. She and Ford have some really great chemistry that really went underused. The movie looks really good, thank you Mr. Spielberg. He does the best he can with what he was given. The stunt action is REALLY good, I'm not a fan of CGI so when it popped up in a few action scenes I was obviously very disappointed. Some old school indy stuff is there to make me feel at home: indy getting interrupted in class, the plane/map travel effect, the hat, the whip, the archaeological intrigue, the score, the action sequencing The bad stuff: Hurt as Oxley is a waste. I understand there needed to be a connection to bring Indy, Shia and Karen together again but he was a major disappointment for me. He stayed around too long in that dumb ""insane"" character. Cate Blanchett for once was not stellar. She was good but not great, too much emphasis on keeping that Russian accent going, it got distracting. Ray Winstone is not that great either. The Ugly: The story is really stupid....ALIENS??? mind reading??? I didn't mind switching from Nazis to Russians in the cold war. I actually thought that was a good idea because it makes the timeline from last crusade-crystal skulls more believable. the Alien story is just laughable really. I would have preferred they kept it more ""mystical"" or ""spiritual"" than trying to provide an answer to an ancient mystery. the script is cringe worthy at parts, not that indy ever had amazing insightful dialog, it was just never horrible. I blame George Lucas for that.In short, it is definitely an Indiana Jones movie...just not a good one. Parts of it are great just for nostalgic reasons. If you were to take this as a stand alone movie or if we were to look at this 20 years from now, it will be a laughable affair and poorly remembered in the series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1765,zach-chastaine,A True Blockbuster! Dr.Jones Is Still Very Much Alive!,10,27 May 2008,"My fellow skeptics and critics! This here is a gem which you all are going to have to see.Like many, I went into the theater afraid that I was about to watch the Indiana Jones title be run into the ground. Being a big skeptic and a critic myself, I was afraid about what I was about to see. What I saw instead was hands down the best movie of 2008. Movies like this do not exist anymore, this was a blockbuster! This proved to me that the magic of Indiana Jones has not and will never die.Mystery, action, car chases, jungles, deserts, gun-fights, fist-fights, sword-fights, whips, a thirsty villain, motorcycles, insects, mummies, spies, crypts! This movie really had it all.The style was phenomenal, using special effects only when the shot could be done no other way, even bringing back techniques that haven't been seen for a while with the age of new movie magic. The acting was simply superb. Each character had so much depth and was so distinct. It was easy to see how solid the writing for this movie was. I was especially impressed with Shia LaBeouf, who was even more unique and entertaining than I have ever seen him before.The action in this film was an art form. None of this pansy stylized wire fighting junk, Indiana Jones actually brawls with his adversaries. No ultra-stylized-Kung-Fu-matrix-guns-mantis-kick could compare to the hardcore knuckle-dusting of this masterpiece. Certain parts could be described as a ""Ballet of Thrills!"". Some people have called the action in this movie ""unrealistic"" and ""too-long"", but then why go into a movie at all if you want it to be realistic? If you want realistic go outside the theater and ride a bike, and please don't review movies if you cant give it a fair chance. The story of this film was seriously a little off the beaten trail. It's really something that hasn't been done before (all the more reason you should see this movie), and I almost didn't like it because it was just so different and unique. I didn't know what to think of Dr.Jone's adventure into the ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" because it has literally never been done before in this manner as far as I know. But in the end I thought that it all worked out just fine. In fact I thought that it was the most unique of his adventures because it was a new twist that the Indiana Jones series hasn't really tapped. Probably because people would be too advert to it. Yet we can't forget that Dr.Jones has gone after the ""Holy Grail"",making this new adventure seem anything but far-fetched. The storyline is really up to the viewer to decide what they think. Personally I thought it was very clever and loved it.As it boils down this was a beautiful movie with superb content, Spielberg and Lucas have brought back this legendary hero in a way that most people didn't think could be done. Harrison Ford is anything but old. The end result has been wonderful.Frankly I think if you don't at least see this movie, you're doing yourself a massive injustice.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1766,icccerider,Indy??,4,20 May 2008,"As a true fan of the series....This is the worst one of the bunch.The old Indy films had real stunts and little CGI. It made it more Indy to me. This film has so much CGI in it, it kind of blows. I mean its a fun film, but its a disspointment to the series. There is a fight somewhere in the movie that looks exactly like a scene from a video game. For $200 million dollars the CGI should look way better.Overall the film had bad CGI, cheesy jokes, and Phantom Menace stlye fail plastered all over it. But no matter what I say or what you the reader may read you will still see it and it will still make millions upon millions upon millions.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1767,yo_hannes1,Indy swings back into our hearts,10,23 May 2008,"The overwhelming action sequences, the comic relief, ""McGuffin"" and even the cheesy one-liners are there, Indy is back! People change, and age, so does Indy. Indy ages like a bottle of wine, that means in a good way. Ford is still agile, charming, hard-boiled and he is still Indiana Jones.The cast in this movie is amazing. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen is still as good as it was in Raiders. Lets not forget the rising star Shia LaBeouf. He is extraordinary, and adds a lot to the film and he works perfectly together with Karen Allen and Ford. Ray Winstone and John Hurt is doing what they can do with there characters, and they succeed. Lets not forget the knowledge-thirsty villain played by Kate Blanchet. She is doing a great job making her character as ""evil Russian"" as possible, and she make good partners with the wig and the accent.The ""McGuffin"" is a little bit different than the Christian symbols we know from Raiders and Last Crusade. Could be compared to the Sankara Stones, that say that everyone hasn't heard of them, the same with the crystal skulls. As long as it stays ""Indy-style"" I love it, and it does stay that way. The story also holds many nice surprises and perfectly executed scenes, including big explosions, intense car-chasing, thrilling sword fights and...monkeys.I loved this movie and it lived up to my expectations, from the cheesy one-liners to the awesome action-sequences. It is well worth the wait, and I hope for another movie of this caliber. If you haven't seen the movie yet, do so. I will watch it at least one more time in the theaters.10/10",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1768,brazilian_dan,Spielberg and Lucas: noted CGI fanatics,2,31 May 2008,"Well, here's another negative review, but let me get to the point. Sure, the other three previous movies boasted a few special effects here and there, but looked realistic enough when they had to. I couldn't help but compare the appearance of those man-eating ants to the bugs in ""Temple of Doom"". Why has there been an exaggerated use of CGI?? Things look phony and absurd!! Now don't get me wrong, the Indy franchise is all about the absurd, this I know. And that's what made the series fun. But I keep thinking at how much more genius Spielberg and Lucas were when they had so little to work with at the time those movies were made. It forced them to put on their thinking caps and figure out how to make certain scenes work because of limited resources they had available at the time. Thanks to CGI, everyone's lazy now. I'm not against this technique, in movies that call for such. But they totally blew it in this one, and it got me thinking. As a director, how much do you demand from your actors to act through a difficult scene which is hard to shoot because of certain elements contained in that same scene, whereas if you put in a little CGI, you've just spared the actor, say, from being covered by real live ants? Please, just an example, but do you catch my drift? How much is everyone involved willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of creating a work of art? They could've done without this installment, really.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1769,Trifcta,Calm Down People,9,24 May 2008,"This is nowhere near the disaster of 'The Phantom Menace', as some are saying. This movie isn't even bad in the vein of 'Spiderman 3'. It's...not bad. I think most of the people who have already seen it (and sweet God people, the film has been out for two days) need to take a step back and look at how harsh they are being.I am bewildered in an era where a movie like this is getting heat from the public (not even the critics guys; they thought it was fine), while the public is accepting true trash like National Treasure 2, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Transformers. How those became popular is beyond me.So what's got everyone all upset here? Shia swung on vines with some monkeys for all of five seconds? Cry me a river. There were aliens at the end? That's cheesy, but an arc belching spirits and blowing up people's heads is okay? Mind-controlling blood in TOD is okay? Every Indiana Jones movie has a culminating sequence with the extraordinary, that let's face it, usually is cheesy.You are all ignoring the return of Harrison; as great in the role as he was back in 1981. He still has that magic charm. You're ignoring Cate Blanchett's great turn as the villain, Karen Allen's welcome return as Marion Ravenwood, and Shia not being obnoxious in the slightest. You're ignoring two hours of a hell of an entertaining movie for flaws that accumulate maybe five minutes of screen time. they are there, but they are not all consuming.Was this the second coming? No. But this is a damn fine, welcome return of a classic series. I'll take Indy over Rambo, Rocky, or Superman anyday.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1770,mgandara,Where was Indy?,5,23 May 2008,"Apparently expecting to see Indiana Jones in an Indiana Jones movie was too much to ask.I knew things were going to be different, I couldn't really expect the same man to show up 20 years later like nothing had happened. But I hoped the core of the character, the reason I liked Indy so much, would still be intact.My favorite part of the original movies was Indy's humanity. He would spend each movie getting beat up over the course of the adventure leaving audiences amazed that he was still standing. All the while, the movies kept reminding us that he was an ordinary man caught up in an extraordinary adventure. He was not super-human. He was equipped with his trademark tools, his knowledge, and his recklessness all packed onto a fairly athletic frame. But at the end of the day, he was still just an average guy. He bled. He got dirty. He screamed with fear in his voice that made you believe in the danger.This may come across as being nit-picky, but I feel a huge part of the iconic image of Indy isn't just his trademark hat, whip and jacket. It's also the blood, sweat and the DIRT on his clothes.Where was the DIRT? I have never seen Indy look so clean. His shirt and pants always had clean pressed look to them. This is such a simple thing to keep track, but for some reason it was completely overlooked. At the start of every new scene, no matter what happened in the previous scene, Indy would walk out with a clean outfit fresh off the wardrobe rack. It felt like Harrison was simply wearing a costume rather than clothes that a character lived in. It's such a trivial thing, but it's something that can take me out of the moment of the movie. It causes me to no longer be able to suspend disbelief.As a sequel, this movie essentially has the rules of the world already established for it. There are some strange supernatural elements in this world, but the characters are human and vulnerable and that must be acknowledged. Not acknowledging the established rules of the world pulls me right out of the movie. I've read other reviews that complain about the Alien element, the excessive use of CGI and how it cheapens the suspense of the action, the one-liners that rarely work, Mutt's name and how he somehow is Tarzan, the underdeveloped characters and the general sense that there was no reason for this movie to exist. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the very thing that took me out of movie early on.The nuclear blast. How does Indy survive? Oh, he just climbs into a lead lined fridge, shuts the door and waits for the blast to launch him clear of the site. The fridge for some reason, launched like a projectile out of the town. And not only that, it was the only fridge to get launched from the town. All the other fridges stayed put for some reason. It also just happened to be on a trajectory that shot past the bad guys as they try to escape in their car. The car of course is crushed by the shock-wave, but the fridge which was at ground zero sailed through the air with no problem. Indy emerges from the fridge perfectly fine. Let's ignore the fact that the fridge didn't get destroyed from the blast and just assume it somehow flew. The landing? How did the landing not kill him? How did the landing not even injure him? Suspension of disbelief. This happened early in the movie, but it was asking a lot from audiences considering Indy spent the three previous movies getting nothing but beat up.The rules had changed. The old Indy is gone. Heck, he spends most of the movie getting called anything but ""Indy."" What we have in his place is a pale shadow of the once great character. The costume is there, too bad the man never showed up to actually wear it.In the end, we are left with a movie that abandons the core elements of it's character. It refuses to be the same old movies of the past and at the same time doesn't take any bold steps into the future.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1771,philipdobson,Indy still rocks,9,26 May 2008,OK first off i gotta say this movie was not as bad as everyone has been saying. now it wasn't perfect but its been nineteen years since Harrison ford has done the Indy role but he still pulls it off very well. my biggest complaint is the thought of Shea lebouf possibly taking over the Indy role. it makes my spine shiver with fear of how possible upcoming Indy movies may turn out. but this one was good yes it has some ridiculous points but so did the other ones nobody can do what Indy does and thats what makes him cool he does it but then he screws up sometimes so stop complaining that he survived a nuclear blast in a lead lined refrigerator but if you ask me its kinda creative in an out of the box kinda way. its a movie its not there to feed the reality bug in us its there to feed the imagination. so just take it as a movie do you honestly think any of the movies out there reflect any part of reality? i think it was a great movie and extremely entertaining i give it a 9/10,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This movie delivered on every level, funny, entertaining and with the inevitable possibility of there being more. The lines in this movie were entertaining catchy and down right almost flawless. This shows the perfection Speilburg has attained in writing dialog. If you were looking for a suspense type realistic movie, get net flix and quit complaining. Shia is becoming increasingly good at what he does, and Harrison Ford always delivers his old school flare movies are loosing. People judge to much and don't realise there at a movie to be entertained. Especially with Indianna Jones. Since when has Indianna Jones been realalistic? The Holy Grail? Voodoo temples?

I didn't really like the whole alien thing, I mean leave that to Mulder and Sculley, although there's nothing wrong with having the commies as bad guys i still preferred the Nazis.The whole idea of Indy's son was pretty stupid if you ask me and the cgi wasn't the best. Although this film is watchable and in some parts really feels like an Indy movie stupid things like the boat/car landing on the tree and mutt swinging with all those monkeys really wasn't very clever and was completely pointless. Where I come from big budget movies (even if they are bad) usually get a ""that was amazing"" or ""that was the best movie ever"" but this time guys were cursing like crazy they thought it was that bad.

1774,Souzouteki,Disappointing compared to the others,6,4 November 2008,"Disappointing compared to the others.I just watched the whole series yesterday and today, and I was really into the first three. The action was great, the characters were fun, the ""quest"" was fun too.When I watched the Kingdom of The Crystal Skulls, I got bored. There was lots of action yeah, that's good, but I felt that it wasn't action like we'd seen in previous films, you know the Indiana Action that makes an Indiana Jones.I think the main problem for me was that Indy did pretty much nothing. In the previous films he was the one that had things in hand ""don't step there, follow me, this is the ancient relic.."" No, here it was Shia doing most of the talking and action, what? I mean the whole scene (which lasts quite long) in the jungle, Indy is just driving the Jeep. Sit a moment and think if that was in one of the previous films, would Marcus or what ever have grabbed a sword and started fighting with the main villain? No, it would've been Indy who would have used his wit and imagination to get closer to the goal and grab that skull.Yeah they were bringing in new blood with Shia, but I want to watch Indiana Jones to see Indy use his wit and what not to overcome the situations. It's like Jack Sparrow, if he doesn't come in and use his wit to get through the situations, then the Pirates of the Caribbean series become much less attractive. Oh and final thoughts, when they get married, at the end. The part where the wind suddenly blows, and you know it. Oh yes you do, you know it will happen right from the start. Indiana's mythic hat flies like a feather in the wind, where does it land? Indiana's head of course! I'm fooling with ya, at Shia's feet. At least Indy grabs it and puts it on his head just before he attempts to put it on, that saved it for me. But still, so predictable, and it's certainly not something I'm looking forward to. Shia was great in Transformers and all, but I'd rather it be the end of Indiana Jones than see him become Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

During the 50's the idea of aliens were a huge thing. People were like obsessed because of this idea. Indy 4 took place in the 50's. I can't believe that anyone who gives this a bottom score is so closed minded. It's a movie for God's sake! No one said Indy has to be grounded! If the Ark of the Covenant could incinerate anyone who see this, than this movie fits in with the other three Indy movies.God people, get a life it's a movie. It's a fun ride with old friends. If you are so frickin narrow minded, don't ruin this for the rest of us.A lot of hard work went into this movie.

Watch this movie it doesn't disappoint. There are always going to be haters to something as waited for as this i was as apprehensive but the whole cast were fantastic and maybe in the future there maybe a follow up on the cards.

If I had not watched a special on the Sci-Fi channel about The legend of the Crystal Skulls, I would have found it rather ridiculous.But I have no agreement held with anything about the making of the movie, the plot, the traditional action scenes of an Indiana Jones movie, or the CGI. Critics made this movie sound like it should never have gotten the faintest brain power of a thought.The carry overs from the previous movies made it nostalgic. The new stroylines and twists made it exciting. The action scenes made it dramatic, and the storyline in general added mystery.Don't listen to the critics. If you like Indiana Jones movies, this is a very well-done sequel. Harrison Ford doesn't look a day over 40 and Cate Blanchett does a wonderful Russian man-eater.I would have liked to see the whip some more too, but I guess you can't have everything in this world.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Indiana Jones has transformed from the everyman professor to a super hero who can do anything and knows almost everything, losing much of the allure of the character. In addition, there are just too many cutesy lines and it really detracts from it.The costuming and sets were weak too.

I grew up watching Indiana Jones and expected allot from this movie and I have to say it delivered, it was funny at the right points and the action was amazing, Spielberg definitely to advantage of the CGI but no complaints here. And as for the ending, I mean what els could he have done? All the previous Indys were supernatural or biblical so I think this story is very justified, simply Indiana Jones in a new age.

1780,kpd-2001,The Critics Were Right,5,23 May 2008,"The first three Indiana Jones were classics--we are all aware of that. Going into this film amid weeks of anticipation and excitement, I (as well as any other Indy fan) knew not to expect another Raiders of the Lost Ark or Last Crusade--but after a 19 year layoff we could have expected a better end result. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull fails to capture the excitement, energy, and humor found in the first three epic films. The plot is extremely thin and does not make a whole lot of sense. The characters are dull and bland and some stunts are so unrealistic that it is almost comical to watch this at times. The few good things I did like about this particular film were that it was great to see one of the best actors in history back in the familiar Indiana Jones costume and that he pulled it off quite well for his age. Also, Shia LaBeouf is a talented young actor who helps this move along at a decent pace. There is a plethora of other material I think they could have developed this movie about rather than the crystal skull and the typical alien backdrop present in many of today's movies. I give this a 5/10 only for Harrison Ford still pulling off a good Indiana Jones character.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Add to this a script that would have been rejected by even the makers of the 'Spy Kid' movies and you have a true recipe for disaster.At first, I thought the over-the-top action scenes were just a way to pay homage to silent films or at least some kind of inside joke. Sadly, I soon began to realize the joke was on me. The film makers actually thought this train wreck unfolding on the screen in front of me was ""entertainment"".The parallels that will be made between this movie and the Phantom Menace will be endless. No doubt fans of both franchises will debate about which film let them down the most. As for my opinion, at least the Phantom Menace had the lightsaber scenes. What did this film have? Shia LaBeouf swinging on some vine like Tarzan with his monkey friends. Oh yeah, that was really cool. I mean come oneven a Disney production would have left that scene on the cutting room floor.Come to think of itmaybe this film really is supposed to be a joke. Maybe this is all some kind of sick, twisted Lucas/Spielberg experiment. I can just see them now, sitting on some remote island sipping martinis and laughing about how gullible and stupid the American public is for actually paying money to see this inexcusable pile of garbage.My prediction is that this film will make a load of money but still be considered a cinematic failure. It won't happen at first. People will not be able accept or grasp that the film they just saw could have actually been that bad, that Spielberg could have allowed such a thing to happen or that an Indiana Jones movie could sink to such lows.However, once the dust settles, once the charm of seeing Indiana Jones back again wears off, the true quality of this film will become apparent.

1783,germanicelander,Embarrassing Trash,1,22 May 2008,"This movie is a jumbled mess. If I was Spielberg I would have insisted my name be removed from this embarrassment. This movie is more like a parody of an Indiana Jones movie. It starts off like a normal movie, but with each scene turns progressively into farce. There were parts of this movie when the entire audience reacted to what was on screen with stunned silence at how stupid things were getting. You can tell this movie was made with the video game in mind. One thing that surprised me greatly is how bad the special effects were done in many of the sequences. Some sequences look great, others more closely resemble a B-movie horror flick. Worse, a theme is not developed, it is simply stated out loud by one of the characters near the end. A more apt title might have been Indiana Jones and the 'deus ex machina'.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1784,speckd02,holy grail...proved Jesus' existence,3,25 May 2008,"it was a campy family reunion with a story about aliens and communists. the convoluted plot involved Russians trying to use alien skulls to obtain knowledge and use it as a weapon.what i don't understand besides the horribly unbelievable action such as the nuclear blast the jungle scene and the space ship ending, why does Spielberg prove in one film the existence of Christ as humanities savior and in the next? they found the holy grail it saved Indy's dad. Christ is/was real and was god's son. i'm not Christian but why not go with it in the next film? instead we have to see a story about Mayans Aztecs ancient pyramids and aliens. the aliens apparently gave humanity civilization and taught humans language, agriculture, and other knowledge.aliens... come on ancient Mayan pyramids, cool. crystal skulls holding powers, cool. but crystal alien skulls that taught humans everything, wow. anyone who liked this movie is someone i would never converse with, ever.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1785,deathroadeshfwf,He's Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but missing something HIS WHIP,8,27 May 2008,"What is with all the these people slagging off the New Indi Film. From all the remade films like Rambo, Rocky Balboa, Terminator 3 etc Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull stands out. Its amazing return of a film icon that everyone loves. From start to finish it was brilliant, don't buy it on fake dvds or wait till it comes out. You've got to see the film at the cinema to get the effect of indi. However something was missing but i don't know what, maybe due to the not so convincing ending to the film. OK its not better than the other three due to the time difference between this film and the last but its still good. Other than that its the typical Indiana film with his one liners, his comedy banter with other characters, the over the top stunts and CGI, and evil baddies, some weird tribes and animals, the camera shots that are used, and obviously the gibberish archaeology stuff Indi comes out with. t i have to agree with a fellow reviewers, there wasn't many whip scenes. If you've grown up with Indiana Jones then you'll love it, but if you haven't you still like it. But get the others out of DVD and watch them.Mr Ford as still got as an Actor, even if Indi is ageing he would probably WHIP (no pun intended) Rocky balboa in acting. Mr Ford fitted straight back into his role. But the person who stood out for me was Indi's side kick Shia LaBeouf, his acting skills on this film shows hes one for the future. Hes the comedy character in this film, which he plays well. One character that didn't impress me was Ray Winstones, i thought we would have had a more active role, and a more stronger significants in the film. The writing for his character was poor. Kate Blanchet is good as always.All i can say is HE'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and still going strong",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1786,daringdanny,"A truly, badly, dreadful film",1,22 May 2008,"I am at a loss for words as to how people have managed to rate this steaming pile so highly! It doesn't deserve to use the name Indiana Jones as it has little or no relation to the other films, other than dragging a clearly aged Harrison Ford and Karen Allen out to reprise their roles. To say the plot was weak is an understatement, it makes little or no sense, not you would think a drawback for an Indiana Jones film, but somehow what could have been fun becomes a trial. My main problem however is lucas' infatuation with poor special effects, having already made a fist of the Star Wars films he (and Spielberg) turn their attention to this franchise. It just doesn't work! The charm of the original films is the old-style stunts and the old Hollywood charms of B-movie classics. This now looks like a bad version of The Mummy. I dearly wanted to like this film, however, this was impossible...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1787,witte013,Indiana Jones and the Great Silliness of It All,9,31 May 2008,"*****SPOILERS GALORE*****This is a silly, silly film. And, maybe surprising to all those who have left negative reviews here, it is just as silly as the previous three Indiana Jones films. Bash a film for having a bad script, bad direction, wooden acting, over-used CGI, etc. (none of which I found in this fourth Indy flick). But bashing an Indiana Jones film for being silly is, well, silly. Let's break down the silliness in this one: Indy surviving a nuclear blast by hiding inside a fridge - Indy and Mutt on a motorcycle being chased by KGB agents in a car and ending up sliding across the floor of the university's library - Mutt using vines to sling his way through the rain forest accompanied by monkeys - crystal skulls being actual skulls from inter-dimensional beings who, in a turn that would make Erich von Däniken proud, were once revered as gods - Indy and his team plunging down three waterfalls in an amphibious car and ending up with nothing worse than wet clothes - Mutt pulling Indy and Marion out of quicksand using a snake - a big bad Russian being dragged into an ant hill by thousands of ants - KGB paranormal researcher whose thirst for knowledge causes her ultimate, and gruesome, demise I could go on. Which brings us to the first three films: Indy taking an idol from a heavily booby-trapped temple, chased by a huge boulder, only to be met by a large and angry tribe who proceed to chase him, and he survives, unscathed - Indy hitching a ride on top of a German submarine that actually submerges and he doesn't drown  Indy and Marion trapped in a chamber with thousands of snakes and neither of them gets so much as nipped by any of them - Nazis melting when the Ark of the Covenant is opened and angry spirits are unleashed - Indy and his companions surviving a fall from the third floor of a nightclub - Indy and his companions jumping out of an airplane in a rubber boat which takes them sliding down a mountain into a river where they plunge down a waterfall - the whole mine car chase sequence  Indy cutting a rope bridge in half, sending a bunch of Thugees to a watery and crocodile-infested grave but surviving it himself  big, bad Thugee cult leader Mola Ram, who can take people's hearts out with his bare hands without killing them  the entire opening sequence of The Last Crusade, in which young Indy is being chased all across a circus train  a German airplane following Indy and his dad into a tunnel  a knight who has been guarding a room full of cups for centuries  greedy American businessman aging and dying in the space of mere seconds after drinking from the wrong cup I could go on.The point is: this is a silly film. All Indiana Jones films are silly. And I wouldn't expect them to be otherwise. What I did expect I got: a roller-coaster-ride of a film that is fun, exciting, entertaining, funny, thrilling, chock-full of great set-pieces, with an interesting story with heavy paranormal and supernatural overtones. The only flaw of this film: it's not Raiders of the Lost Ark. But the same should be said of Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade. I for one am looking forward to future Indiana Jones adventures. Here's to hoping for a lot more silliness.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1788,pigeo000,the characters were there but the idea missed,4,26 May 2008,"Loved the writing between characters and the one liners, it was classic indiana jones and it was cheesy but awesome what i expected.what i didn't expect and enjoy is the presence of cgi. not at any point did i believe the film was shot on location anywhere, it really took away from the whole indiana jones archoligist explorer experience. Personally it made me feel like i was watching sin city at some points.The story, yeah i kind of understood it but so many holes in it, and it didn't connect well maybe it was well over my head, but in the same sense i was to distracted with the cgi to really care. yes the effects were awesome but whatever happened to old fashoned stunts and actually sets.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I don't know why everyone thinks Raiders of the Lost Ark stands out over all of them, I would put it third in the list.Nonetheless, Indiana Jones 4 is terrible movie and a disgrace to the Indiana Jones franchise! Whoever thinks the film is good obviously isn't a proper fan, I am so disappointed that Harrisson Ford signed up to such a dreadful storyline and acted in some of the most terrible scenes in history!! Harrisson Fords age shouldn't of even been an issue in the film, he looked fine apart from the grey hair they could of got rid off. To turn Indiana Jones into a sci-fi film is a complete joke! Lucas and Spielberg have gone from some of the best film producers in the world to the worse and should of retired a long time ago! Just before they made the new Star Wars films and Wr of the Worlds another disaster! I found myself sat in disgusted at what I've watched more then humor, such as Indy surviving an nuclear explosion by sitting in a fridge! and watching shia swing from the trees with his monkey friends to save the day! You'd think a 4 year old wrote the script! The film gets 2/10. Ray Winstone was terrible in it too!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1790,Eyesonlyhackr,"Indiana Jones is meant to entertain, so stop freaking out",8,24 May 2008,"Okay so I've been reading through all of these comments, and here's the deal: Since when has an Indiana Jones movie not been outrageously over the top? Be it nuclear explosions and refrigerators or Indy moving a GIANT stone tablet all by himself, or any of the hundreds of neat-yet-impossible tricks he does with that whip of his, they're all over the top and meant to entertain. There is almost NO basis in fact, and WHO CARES. You all enjoyed the last three, but you expect this one to be realistic and plausible because everyone's been swept up in the idea that what happens on screen has to be able to happen in real life.I pose a question to those of you who say the most recent addition is more outrageous than those before it: Which is more likely to happen? Alien's discovered in tombs in South America OR A Thuggie(sp)priest ripping a man's heart out of his chest with his bare hands, and the man still being alive and talking? I think that just about proves my point.You all need to quit freaking out and digging into everything, and take the movie at face value, which is what it's intended for. It was made to entertain, it's not a documentary: it's 100% FICTION. It took an idea based in fact, and made it something extraordinary and entertaining.

1791,Captain_Subtext,Indiana Jones satire,5,20 July 2008,"There are two ways you can view this movie, first as an Indiana Jones movie and second as a new movie altogether. As an Indiana Jones movie, it's disappointing, it seems as if Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Lucas decided to celebrate the fact that they made Raiders by making every scene in Crystal Skull so over the top that it became absolutely ridiculous. As a new Indiana Jones movie, I give it 4 out of 10 stars.But, as a new movie altogether it's quite entertaining, and better than other adventure movies of the last years such as National Treasure. If you look at it as a new vehicle for Ford I can give it a 6 out of 10 stars.So altogether, not terrible, but certainly bad. It has nothing to do with the old Indiana, Ford is on fire though.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1792,mandi_lou89,Decent.,7,24 May 2008,"I just got done watching this ""New Indy Movie"" and left the theatre somewhat perplexed.The cinematography and the acting and the action scenes and the plot layout were excellent and followed the format of ROTLA and the Last Crusade. Harrison Ford hid his age very well and Karen Allen gave an excellent performance that kept the character of ""Marion"" very well intact from the first Indy movie *Spoiler* The movie is fine and dandy and is a true Indiana Jones movie up until the point when the digitally created alien appears. After that the movie becomes too saturated with Sci-Fi and modern film technology. The spaceship that comes out of the temple completely and utterly destroys the movie's semblance of the original Indiana Jones films.I gave this movie a 7 because I was ready to call friends and recommend the movie to them as the second greatest Indy film until the last 15 minutes. After that, I will say that the movie was just decent...hence the title of this post.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I could not possibly recommend anybody to go see this movie, on top of being boring, its story line is so stupid. The whole entire time I felt as if I was on some type of theme park ride that just was not getting exciting.The beginning starts out okay, however the introduction I felt was just to rapid and didn't let you warm up to the new feeling of Indie. With a couple of exciting chases and escapes the beginning was satisfactory.After a fun jungle scene the film completely falls apart with no story to help recover it. By this time your feeling the length of the movie and you want it to end. The ending is definitely the worst, it was just so stupid and I really couldn't believe that Spielberg and Lucas messed up that bad.So this movie hardly makes it to the rental list. However if you really want to see a good movie go see The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1794,DarthProject,"Indy in the 1950s, yet in full Indiana Jones style",10,27 June 2008,"With ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", undiscussed geniuses Spielberg, Lucas and the other classic Indy filmmakers accomplished the challenge of realizing an Indy movie of the 1950s in all senses, yet enclosing the complete Indiana Jones style.The light sparkling adventure style is all there, as well as the multiple references to the older movies - even more than ever, since the return of Marion from ""Raiders"". Indy's father isn't in the movie because Sean Connery retired from acting, and Marcus Brody isn't too because the actor passed away - both characters are already dead in the movie, but they get the appropriate references. There are narrative connections with ""Raiders"", stylistic connections with ""The Last Crusade"" and ""The Temple of Doom"", the movie also quotes an episode of the ""Young Indiana Jones"" TV series. Hence Indy4 is really the film which ties all the saga. There are even the classical references to other Lucas/Spielberg movies, this time very interesting.The peculiarity of this movie is that we are in the 50s, so instead of Nazi we got Russians (Cate Blanchett is too sexy and fun with short black hair and a USSR suit), and the movie encapsulates all the essential topics that historical period, including cold war and McCarthyism (not by case one of the new characters is called Mac). Even more important, there's also a slight shift in genre. It's sad that most of the audience considers this out of Indy style, but it's exactly this fact that is in full Indiana Jones spirit: the new movie is not only set in the 50s but also partly filmed like a 50s B-movie, just as the old movies were not only set in the 30s but also filmed like 30s adventures. There's a shift in a more ""modern"" direction, a bit more mystery, and, to say one, if Indy was partly based on Humphrey Bogart, thew new young character, Mutt, is quite a reference to Marlon Brando. Yet, just as in the tradition of the older movies, you get an adventure revolving around an artifact, which is important for the religion of an ancient civilization; and the main characters tie together when facing enemies, tombs, horrible animals and other perils.The Indy/50s style fusion is everywhere, from the set production (traditional archaeological sites and university, but also Harley-Davidson motorbikes and diners) to the photography (intentionally a bit in lighter tone); from the special effects (real sets and stunt-men, but digital for determinate scenes, just as the revolutionary visual effects in the ""Raiders"" finale) to the music: to classical themes like Marion's and the one of Indy's father, Williams adds new themes for the Russians and the Crystal Skull, and scherzos in the chasing scenes in style similar to ""The Last Crusade"".As for Indy's physical limits due to his older age, Spielberg chose a right compromise between realism and the traditional Indy cartoon-like style: if in the beginning you see lots of Indy action but also auto-irony, as the movie progresses part of the acrobatic action is moved to other characters, and for the tombs Indy uses more brain than muscles - Ford, to use his words, wanted to show that Indy is not only an action hero. Though, that it's not too evident and it doesn't slow the rhythm, because you are involved by the action and tying of the group of main characters, which is sustained by a familiar chemistry between the actors. Small jewel is the character of Prof. Oxley, played by the great John Hurt.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I definitely share the same opinion. Indiana Jones' first three films were full with adventures, excitement and funny dialogs and so the fourth one! I've been waiting this with great hopes and it was good the see again the main topics(frightening of snakes, love, evil characters with plans for leading the world(Cate Blanchett made an outstanding role)), old characteristics and extreme actions. I really enjoyed it. The only thing I didn't like was the ""new boy"", I think no one is good instead Harrison Ford, he's the best in this film, he's the biggest reason why we love this film, isn't he?:)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1796,TehRaven,Great film,10,13 May 2008,"A fantastic film from start to finish. I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening over the weekend and I was amazed at to how the team was able to make yet another Indy film. I must say I had my doubts but they were swiftly brushed to one side.Fantastic action sequences and tense moments really drove home the action portion of the film, whereas the sentimental emotional scenes really got me.In my opinion this is probably my second favourite Indy film, which it should hold in some high regard as the previous three are firm favourites in my movie library.Absolutely sublime from start to finish",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1797,emrecan-2,"If the adventure has a name, it is Indiana Jones:)",10,25 May 2008,"First of all let me tell you that I am a huge fan of the previous films. Although I think that Raiders is the ultimate Jones flick, Temple and Grail are also great sequels in their own rights.I guess the major problem with today's world of cinema is expectations. The previous movies set a very high standard both for the series itself and the whole adventure movies genre. Still today, we can see the impact of Indiana Jones at movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy Series and the National Treasure flicks (The last two were just bad imitations of them, to be sincere) It has been 19 years since the Last Crusade and the expectations were heightened enormously because every Indy fan shot their own Indy movie in their minds for years. I am perfectly sure that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were thinking the exact same thing while preparing the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but the same thing goes for the previous sequels that are the Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade. They knew that it would be impossible to top Raiders so they always tried new things - the second movie being really dark and frenzy and the third being really humorous compared to Raiders.Spoilers - I guess the major problem of the community with the movie was the alien based McGuffin and the overuse of CGI. Let me first state that I loved the alien plot because it is really a fresh area for Indy movies. Also by setting the movie in 1957, the filmmakers moved into a whole new era, the popular period of the alien b-movies. The movie, in my terms, provided a decent amount of ""archeological research"" like the previous ones and successfully transformed the 30s serial based theme to 50s. And come on, all Indy movies included a lot of CGI - just remember the final scene of Raiders. I agree that Mutt playing the Tarzan wasn't the greatest idea but all the scenes involving CGI were pretty good actually.I won't talk about the quality of the crew because they are all in top form. Spielberg once again proves that he can become the ultimate blockbuster king when he just wants to. You can sense all of filmmakers' joy while watching the movie.Overall, I can say that I was quite entertained by the Skull. The most important thing about it that it has the ""soul"" of the previous films which in today's cinema, many sequels can not succeed in. The people who gave this one bad points will love it when they give it a second chance, I am sure. It's pure fun and great escapism. Enjoy the ride!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1798,anontalk,Get it Right!!,5,23 May 2008,"I think the movie was OK, if you learn to suspend all belief and be completely swallowed by the film.I was disappointed though within the first 10/15 mins of the film where Indy is teaching and he mentions ""Skara Brae"" and he says ""on the West coast of Scotland""...!! Get it right people, I am not sure how much researcher/scriptwriters get paid but surely they can afford for someone to type placenames into Google and get basic facts right!! Skara Brae is in fact on Orkney which is an island off the North coast of Scotland....this disappointed me and set me up to doubt all and any facts that were spoken in the film. (legends, places, myths etc) C'mon Indy I thought you were supposed to be an archaeologist!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1799,rab67-2,Indiana Jones and the Dumb Script,1,11 May 2009,"I lost confidence in this film when (hunting for a highly magnetic object) Indy announced: ""The metal in this gunpowder should point the way!"". Unfortunately this was in the ninth minute, and it went downhill after that.Yes, Indy is back. It is now 1957 (Back when Belize was still British Honduras, by the way) and Commies have replaced Nazis as the villains of choice.It's good to see Ford again, but the film lurches from one mind numbingly unbelievable escape to another, so it is difficult to feel any concern for the characters as you know the next dumb set piece is around the corner.The worst has to be the flying fridge, where Indy ducks into to escape a nuclear explosion. The blast blows the fridge through the air faster that the actual blast wave, which it overtakes, before landing in the desert miles away. Indy then exits the fridge in good shape, rather than in a bloody pulp, so I guess American refrigerators have better crumple zones and airbags than I gave then credit for.Indy must be an incredibly bad judge of character if he spent all those years with Mac, without noticing his lust for money.I seem to remember that Spielberg had taken great pains to use the same film stock and lenses as the original films to ensure the same look. But what about acres of CGI? Was that in the original films? No? That was a waste of time then.I am glad I rented this film, as it saved me money compared with a visit to the cinema or buying the DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1800,Menno-Dreischor,"Mildly entertaining, but shallow film",6,26 May 2008,"After 19 years Indy is back, but not in great form. As a number of reviews have already noted the film relies heavily on over-the-top action sequences rather than a good story. The fact that after watching the movie you mostly remember references to the old movies and the in-jokes rather than the plot or any of the new characters is not a good thing. Unlike with the previous movies there is no sense of discovery at the end of this film.Although Harrison Ford is in good form, despite his advanced years, most of the other characters are hardly developed. John Hurt's character, Oxly, is underused and there is no indication of a long lasting relationship between Indy and Oxly other than a statement by Indy. Shia LaBeouf does a good enough job at playing Indy's son Henry III, but sadly enough the undiscovered son subplot is used solely as a setup for a number of jokes, rather than characterization. Karen Allen, in the role of Marion Ravenwood, is given little to do and her marriage to Indy at the end of the movie seems to come out of the blue as their relationship is hardly developed in this film. The antagonists in the film are the Russian's although they could just as well have been the Belgians as hardly any motivation is given for their quest for the Golden City. Also Cate Blanchet's villain is not very menacing. She's supposed to have psychic powers, but these fail with the first character she meets, namely Indy. Her psychic abilities are subsequently not used in any way throughout the rest of the story.Some of the action sequences are good, particularly the chase on the motor bike, which brings back some good memories. Many of the action sequences lack tension though, while some are plain ridiculous. The fact that Indy and the other characters have become superhuman in this installment doesn't help either. After Indy survives an atomic bomb blast at the start of the film it becomes hard to imagine that he could be hurt by anything. All in all I was mildly entertained, but hardly moved. It was nice to see Indy in action again, but with a little more characterization and a little less exposition it would have been more enjoyable.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1801,paka1121,"Oh well, better luck next time...",2,22 May 2008,"I went to see the movie at midnight because I was SO excited. I was expecting to be amazed and blown away. I had read everything I could on the up coming movie and was pleased by all I read. I mean Spielberg, Lucus and enough money to run a small country, how could they screw it up? But they managed to find a way! Harrison Ford, did well. He looked great, acted great and still had that playful grin that makes most girls go weak at the knees. I thought Shia LaBeouf was also pretty good, he was the young blood the movie needed. But Karen Allen, for all the money that she was getting from this movie, I think she could have spent a little more on her looks. In Raiders, she's beautiful! But in this film she looks like some soccer mom who didn't get any sleep the night before. Botox, cover up, select hair products and a few weeks at the gym, were all that were required to make her look an acceptable version of the sex symbol in the white dress she use to be. But all and all the actors did well for the script that was handed to them. Unfortunately the script is what was horrible. Aliens, really?! I mean I was fine with the whole crystal skull strangeness. I was ready to believe that they could twist the skull into some really neat old legend. But then this skull comes out with a raised forehead and I was half expecting Sigouney Weaver to jump out of the background at any moment. I stopped taking the movie seriously and began to laugh at that and in the part that Shia becomes the next George of the Jungle, by swinging on jungle vines with his new monkey friends. But that's the best they could come up with? There weren't any other really cool old mysteries to put on film, so they had to go with creatures from outer space? The ending was the worst part though. As soon as the new Jones family walked into a room with 13 crystal alien skeletons, I knew someone somewhere needed to be fired and seriously reconsider his life's calling. Then in the final moments with a space ship that looked like it belonged in an episode of the X-Files, the entire film fell apart. Now I really did enjoy some bits and pieces, which were the only redeeming qualities. I liked the call backs to other Indy movies, and the brand of action and comedy that can only be found in Lucas films. And it was great to see Harrison Ford on screen again for the role that he was made for. I just wish the rest of the movie had done as well.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1802,cazmaster,You have to see it,8,20 May 2008,"You have to see it. Why? Because its Indiana Jones and it is always worth it.Harrison Ford was spectacular throughout the movie and the Indiana Jones ""feeling"" permeated the movie with plenty of allusions to prior installments to keep the hardcore fans reminiscing. Shia LaBeouf worked surprisingly well in his role and the interaction between his character and Indiana were great. It gave the movie a lot of the funness that ""Last Crusade"" had with the interaction with Sean Connery.One of the surprising disappointments of the movie was Cate Blanchett. Her acting was not up to its normal par and she felt forced. Her character lacked the motivating energy that it should have had and the final scenes with her were only bearable by the fact it is a typical Indiana Jones ending.The premise seemed a little out of place - if I can say so given the Ark of the Covenant and Holy Grail that were in prior movies but somehow it lacked the architectural realism that I expected.Having spilled out my ""bad"" comments I want to finish by saying I will surely buy and enjoy watching it again in the future. It truly felt great to watch and is a must see for Indiana Jones fans and non-fans (do they exist?).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1803,mtv500,very old hat,4,21 May 2008,"I am sure it must have been four or five years ago when I heard that another Indy film was going to be made, so naturally I was brimming with anticipation on the way into the cinema.Perhaps I was expecting too much, the hype and fanfare this film has received is rarely lived up to, but in all honesty it was just a bit pants.There were good elements and Harrison Ford did little wrong, despite his advancing years. Actually, one of the best elements of the film was the acceptance of an ageing Indiana. Unlike Die Hard 4, where John MacClean seemed to forget he was about 92 and performed some impressive acrobatics on the wing of a jet plane, Indy looked world weary and a bit knackered. However, this promised to make the unfolding spectacle all the more intriguing. I was looking forward to Indy using his wisdom to 'old man' the villains, in a similar way to Teddy Sheringham's brilliance in his last few seasons, where he could befuddle a stupid 19 year old full-back just by raising his left eyebrow. Sadly this was an opportunity missed.The action was fun and moved along at a good enough pace, there was some half decent tongue in cheek humour, but it all just went nowhere, and the action and the humour just wasn't enough to redeem it. The real person to blame here is George Lucas, who has written a dreadful story about tin foil skulls and ridiculous standard-image alien super beings that could have been farted out by The Mummy returns' production team tea lady. Lucas and Spielberg may have invented all of these clichés with the original trilogy, but it seems that they have become tragic parodies of themselves. The script, in places, is awful. At the climax, when the aliens have had their crystal head replaced on their crystal shoulders and are spinning off in there 1950s B-movie spaceship, Indy asks John Hurt ""Where are they going? Space?"", to which John Hurt replies ""No, they are going to the spaces between space"", to loud sounds of guffaws and vomiting from the cinema screen I was in. (He was explaining that they weren't actually from space but from another dimension). Indiana also tells his young protégé, Mutt, that the treasure that had all along been mentioned was actually knowledge. Another sickener, and even more so when you remember (as I do) that knowledge as treasure was the whole concept behind classic Indy rip-off MacGyver:Lost treasure of Atlantis. Now is it me, or is something amiss when classic franchises begin to rip off their own rip-offs. (I know it's probably me ... but MacGyver- Brian Blessed now he is an actor).Spielberg is not innocent either. Cate Blanchett's villain rather than frightening is at worst annoying, with some sort of odd 1950s Russian communist bob haircut, which is far more distracting than it needs to be, is played like a cross between Edna Mode from the incredibles and whoever Missi Pyle was in Stormbreaker (Another crap film that took my money). John Hurt is made to say some awful guff, (see above) and Ray Winstone is also disappointing. These are three of the most distinguished actors in film today. With so much talent at his disposal I think Spielberg should have done a little better.I get what this movie was trying to do, recapture the old camp 80s action magic. It just doesn't succeed for two reasons: a) It's not the 80s anymore, times have moved on. b) It is not as exciting, funny, or anywhere near as good as any of those original films.Maybe I had too long to think about this movie, maybe so had George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

However, due to my incredible computer skills I was able to obtain the entire trilogy. I watched them within two days and have come to like the series and the concept immensely. So, because of sleep insomnia that I developed in college living with a retard from Walnutport, PA, I bought tickets for a midnight showing of the movie ahead of time and sold two of the tickets to my friends for $8.50 a piece. So we left to the movies at 11:15 pm on a Wednesday night and it was slightly raining. We made a pit stop at Stop & Shop and picked up some candy. Then we went to the movies and parked in a vacant row. We went to theater one and decided that it was too jammed up with a bunch of rowdy people. So we went to the second theater. The movie started and two hours and change later it finished. The overall synopsis of the movie was that constantly throughout the movie there were many inconsistencies dealing with the laws of physics and realistic portraits of the world, more specifically the Amazon (region not river). However, the main heroic image of Indiana Jones was portrayed in slightly a comic manner, but in such a way where it retains the attention of the laymen audience over the entire duration. Overall, Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones and delivers a performance that won't leave you disappointed. The Russians are once again negatively portrayed in this movie. Even after many years of relentless abuse, Hollywood continues to brutalize the Russian image with messages of hate and socialism. The special effects are absolutely amazing. For example the physics of centrifugal force is displayed very vividly and in copious detail. The images involving this centrifugal force will blow your mind. Prepare for after shock comrades. There was a large disappointment of young, gorgeous women in the cast of characters in the movie. This movie doesn't follow the trend as in the other three movies. I blame the media for this catastrophe. They constantly attempt to highlight a woman's inner beauty, while we all know that in reality outer physical beauty is virtually all that counts in life. As I visualize the movie in my head after having a vanilla milkshake that I'm sure had a hidden strawberry in the bottom, I became fixated on one particular scene, the specifics of which I will not disclose. But during which one character wildly resembles his unevolved self while partaking in activities with his ""primateprial"" brethren (Walls). It brought in a sense of inconceivability or absurdity to the movie above the level of acceptability of the other questionable scenes. P.S. And by the way, there is no reward for staying after the credits, unless you have a strong passionate desire to discover who is this movie's ""Second Second Assistant Director"" (No joke). Leave five minutes early and go get a milk shake from McDonalds and tell them ""No strawberries."" Tell the lady at the window to keep the change, even though you will receive the penny you did not ask for.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1805,kingconnelly,Epic masterpiece,10,22 May 2008,"I am very tempted to say that this is the best Indy film yet, although its hard because I am in love with all of them.Im going to keep this short and simple.Way more than a blockbuster, this movie is a beautifully relevant myth of our times.Not only does it have a heavy and thought provoking plot, but it is very entertaining and action filled along the way.The acting couldn't be better, truly. Even Shia; he did very well, which I have to admit was not expected.I was honestly thinking this movie was gonna be a silly Hollywood redux of the classic indy mythology, but boy was I wrong, It really is in a league of its own, the whole movie had me so excited and involved. My expectations were totally blown out of the water.And let me tell you, there is much more than meets the eye with this one, very brilliant symbolic overtones throughout the whole movie. The deeply symbolic and almost spiritual nature of the movie left me awestruck at the shear magnitude of this film.Harrison Ford proved how talented of an actor he is, he totally played Indiana in sync with his previous performances, and even evolved and elaborated his character in a very pleasing way.I have been watching indiana jones before I could even read, and he has been a very large infulence on me, being a hero I often imitated as a child, I was truly ecstatic to see this wonderful myth unfold to be exactly what it is, an epic masterpiece. Im totally in love with these films, and the latest one is top tier to say the least. Absolutely fantastic, I hope that this is not the end of the Indy mythology but a new beginning, shia has a very promising persona that I wouldn't have believed unless I saw it myself. Thank you George and Steven, your are wonderful mythmakers of our time, and please KEEP THEM COMING!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1806,bpl2202,Save your money,1,22 May 2008,"I will give this movie a 2 only for the action scenes. The story line was like a science project that was created the night before the science fair. Please do not expect to see a good movie, like raiders of the lost ark. That movie at least had good special effects. Not to mention Cate Blanchet who had the worst fake Russian accent I have ever heard. There are so many cheesy parts in this film I felt like I was drowning in a lake of cheddar. I feel sorry for Harrison ford he was good in this film like every other film he has been in. This movie was put out for one purpose money making and thats it. Other people in the theater walked out some of them were really angry. This is why people download movies because the money they spend simply is not justified. Like I said the acting was not good except Harrison ford. The story line was just pathetic and the special effects were lousy (the green screen is so obvious). Don't waste your time SAVE YOUR MONEY",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1807,the-e-wing,Should have been left as a trilogy.,3,22 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a stab to the heart of anyone who considers themselves to be an Indiana Jones fan. All I have to say about this movie is that it would have been smarter to have never made it. In my opinion, this movie is an atrocity to all who have enjoyed the Indiana Jones trilogy. Yes, it should still be considered a trilogy, because in no way should this movie be included. Other than the fact that if you like Indiana Jones you probably will hate this movie, I thought that it could be a decent movie for people who have never experienced the real thing or even know about the legendary Indiana Jones. The movie provides a unique story with a lot of action and adventure that is capable of entertaining. But, and this is a big BUT, if you like Indiana Jones, don't pay to go see this movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1808,tylert_1,Ups And Downs,6,22 May 2008,"I am completely and utterly obsessed with the Indiana Jones franchise. I've watched the films countless times since I was a child.I almost want to hurt George Lucas because of the last fifteen minutes of this movie. Last time I checked, Indiana Jones movies didn't have flying saucers and aliens tie up a climax as well as loose ends with the idea of ""oh...well...its aliens and stuff i guess we aren't supposed to understand what the point of anything that just happened was"" Im honestly heartbroken. The entire movie was exceptional, with the exception of where the plot device took us....aliens and flying saucers. It killed me. Im going to go cry...Nonetheless, ill still buy the film. Chances are, however, that the DVD player will always mysteriously turn off about 15 minutes before this film is over.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1809,kittygomiaou,Very disappointing is an understatement.,3,22 May 2008,"This was such a disappointment coming from Spielberg and such a talented cast.Where to start? There is only so-much fantasy and unrealistic elements the audience can handle. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a perfect example of how an action movie can cross the line.1. Indiana Jones forgets his knife at home? REALLY? 2. NO hero survives falling from THREE giant waterfalls and having kilotons of surging water falling onto their head. Especially not grandpa Indy.3. What's with the boat car? 4. Ohhh... the digital look! ARGH! 5. ..... A fridge protects from a nuclear blast? 6. ""The space between spaces""? What? 7. Crystal skeletons... Isn't crystal one of the most fragile substances there is? And it certainly ISN'T known for its flexibility OR strength.8. Are metallic objects only magnetic when thrown into the air? 9. This ""crystal skull"" looked a lot like a plastic skull filled with cellophane wrap.10. The ending felt a little too X-filesy (ie. flying saucer emerging from the ground?) 11. What happened to this idea of a portal to another dimension? 12. Where did the monkeys come from? 13. Mutt swinging through vines... a little too Tarzan-like, perhaps.14. The relationship between Indy and Marion wad clearly under-developed.15. The acting was simply appalling (through no fault of a usually decent cast, it appears) 16. ""Their treasure wasn't gold... it was knowledge"" is an over-recycled theme.17. The car chase through the jungle was too long and too over-the-top.18. Any person with a basic understand of physics would be offended by the idea of Indiana Jones being motionlessly sitting at the front of a rocket-sled stopping brutally from moving hundreds of miles an hour.19. The dialogue was embarrassingly corny.20. The title mentions a kingdom. The film mentions no king OR kingdom whatsoever. Except in the title.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1810,chinesetakout,I didn't love it,6,22 May 2008,"I agreed with the people who thought that the intro, where Indiana gets blasted out of a house in a fridge and tossed about WAS RIDICULOUS AND COMPLETELY UNBELIEVABLE. INDIANA JONES HIMSELF understanding that Harrison ford is older now and not as limber as he used to be is important in understanding his character as Indiana Jones. he still had his youthful charm but he looked uncomfortable most of the time, especially when fighting, he just looked like an old man, at one point i wanted some one to throw him a walker instead of his whip. i loved him though so nothing against him.EVIL ANTAGONIST Moving on to the new evil character. Blanchet does what I can only assume was her best job whilst sporting the most idiotic hairstyle, and boring nonspecific uniform. Not to mention her attempt at the Russian accent was simply offensive. SHIA i adored him in this movie, he was the embodiment of a slick young Indiana Jones i could see him following in his fathers footsteps and he was so hot riding his motorcycle around.ACTION AND HUMOR I REALIZE that avid Indiana Jones watchers want and expect lots of seamless humor and action, but that was just not achieved here with the insanely busy CGI screen jungle car fight, thats not to say however that it was not sort of cool in its own way. I simply am arguing that it was so extreme that it seemed more that superhuman to the point of being, again, unbelievable. i thought most of the humor was good though, it was just the action i had a problem with.STRANGE TRADER SIDEKICK GUY I was sad that Marcus was gone, and that psychotic quadruple agent was crazy. If this movie did anything right my be it was brining back the original actress who played Marion. My soul shouted with joy when I saw her properly aged face and body! Thank you! I was slightly put off by her crazy moments during the life threatening action sequences where she would momentarily loose character and laugh or smile. ALEINS I don't think that it was wise to be so alienish, although i feel that aliens were the next rational step, i was more shocked that they were actually shown in full (and alive) confirming their existence instead of hinting or suggesting it. i would rather have seen more religious or God related stuff, i mean each Indiana Jones movie was either about something to do with god or it was highly religious, this one was kind of out there. OVERALL What i think made this movie disappointing was the fact that most of us were expecting so much out of the famed sequel, but honestly, if your going to mess with gold, you better make something that is at least as good. plus there is the debate on whether or not this movie was trying too hard to follow in the footsteps of the older Indiana Jones movies or whether it was trying to sidestep the older movies to be more modern.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1811,icomandthearmiesofrohan,Its a big let down but i have good reasons...,3,22 May 2008,"This film for the first hour was OK, but one reason was the new characters, no depth or we don't know who they are at all, and one is out of his mind until the end of the film were we don't care about him anyways. The ending was the biggest let down, it was a mix of ""E.T."" and ""Mission to Mars"" but twice as fake. The title of ""Crystal Skull"" is a bit off as it is, but the skull becoming an alien skull, and a big UFO taking off at the end with ""Indiana"" saying a very cheesy line of ""Thier gift was knowledge"" makes you want to laugh but, you cant because you cant believe it got so fake, boring, and phony. And his son ""Mud"" who is annoying as an actor, was not annoying at all, but couldn't be anything but dull, the acting on his part is about as exciting as paint drying. There were to many fake looking scenes that you never actually are sucked into the plot. Im sorry Steven, ever since ""War of the Worlds"" i have not understood what you see or think when making these films. I know Lucas must have tweaked with something because this film is just like the last 3 star wars films, with aliens, pointless characters and all.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1812,robbie873,How Could You George?,3,22 May 2008,"I will not go deep into a critical (and well-deserved) analysis of this film; plenty of other reviews have already said more than I could fit here. But I would like to point out one glaring revelation.Frank Darabont penned an early draft for this film in 2002, which Spielberg loved and lauded as the best he'd seen since Raiders. George Lucas, in his infinite wisdom, declined that script, and moved forward with his own vision, fully realized in this blow to many American childhoods.For the record, Frank Darabont has recently written scripts for The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Mist. He has doctored scripts such as Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report. Needless to say, his record shines with an Oscar-like glow.George Lucas, on the other hand, has recently written and directed the three Star Wars prequels. I feel that statement speaks for itself.Ford, Spielberg, you should have pounced on that Darabont script as if your lives depended on it. I was not expecting a ""Second Coming,"" as Lucas said, with this Indiana, but I was also not expecting an utter destruction of everything holy within the Indiana Jones universe, a job that the finale of this movie did quickly and neatly.Mr. Lucas, it is time to face the facts: you no longer should be allowed to revisit your own masterpieces. Leave the writing to the experts, for you sir have fallen from grace. Sad but true.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I have been an Indy fan since I was a very young kid, and this film just did what I had hoped it would not do. Once again, it goes to show what Hollywood can do to destroy a good character for making money. Reviews that have said the movie ""feels like the other three Indy movies"" must have been written by people taking crazy pills. The story was insanely awful, and very little of the movie is actually believable and/or entertaining. Everything from the beginning of the film to the end was painfully hard to watch. After attending a midnight screening of this movie, I was wishing that I had stayed home and gotten more sleep before work the next morning and that my image of Indy would go back to what it once was. If you are a big fan of the first Indy movies, then stay far far away from this pile of garbage.

More like 65 old senior citizen leads ridiculous adventure...,5,22 May 2008,"I've seen all the Indiana Jones movies since I was little and honestly loved each one of them. I was pumped up to see this movie and saw it at a prescreening show on Tuesday. It was a free show with free beer and it was still an awful movie. I can't tell you how much of a disappointment this movie was.It starts off with Harrison Ford who is definitely looking his age, surviving a nuclear blast by jumping into a refrigerator and getting blasted a mile away...he just gets up and is fine, Nuclear Blast!? No big deal. Then the usual adventure movie jumping around stuff; typical Indiana Jones style which was cool. He meets his greaser son Shia LaBeouf. LOL, I can't believe they tried pushing Shia LaBeouf as a greaser, it was just so cheesy and it did not fit at all.Skip to the end...the Crystal Skull is an alien skull which is also obvious from the beginning, but Indiana Jones must have dementia since his last movies because even he couldn't figure out that it was an alien skull.

The chase scenes are a ride worth taking. And there are explosions worthy of the kid in all of us.The cast does a great job. The newbies fit in wonderfully and those that came back have done a great job developing their characters for this next chapter. And they did a good job of tying up loose character ends from previous films.I hear people complaining of plot holes and the cheese factor, but that's how Indy has always been. I'm glad the franchise hasn't changed it's gooey, swiss-cheese heart.I highly recommend it and can't wait to see it again.

1816,mastermaximant,Indy Fan's won't be disappointed,10,24 May 2008,The movie is a compilation of all the Indy movies combined. It follows closely to Raiders and Crusade but not so much the Temple of doom. I saw it twice and the second time I felt the movie was better as I understood the story more. All of the acting is great and Cate Blanchett's Irina is my new favorite Indy villain. I really don't understand all the bad reviews. It is not nearly as CGI as the new star wars series and they don't stray from the original series which I felt hurt star wars. If your not big on Indy then you may not get the supernatural aspects of the movie. It's not as far fetched as the Wrath of the Ark or the healing of the Grail. In fact I feel this may be more in the realm of reality then those.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1817,MsPiggy77,"Indy, my friend",9,24 May 2008,"First of all, it makes me so very sad reading all this negative comments. I agree that this is indeed not a very good movie, and i was, like more people, slightly disappointed too. But still, i am an Indy fan and i can and will not speak negative of my greatest hero! All those people who call them selves 'Indy fans' and hate this movie, be ashamed to rate it with one star, it doesn't deserve it!The movie is indeed a bit over the top, i agree with that. But hey! isn't that what the other 3 films made it so much fun? I hear people complaining about the waterfalls, the fridge scene and the monkey swinging scene. But when you look back at the other films, i mean, jumping out of an airplane in a rubber boat, grabbing someones heart out of his chest and the bloke is even still alive, falling down with a tank of a cliff, and even tell the tale, a 700 year old knight in a cave, an ark which contains what, sand and ghosts? Running from a big marble in a cave, a German plane flying into a tunnel, passing a car without burning the Joneses? Come on, admit it, we loved this! And we still do!Spielberg tried to bring this back, but the biggest problem is, it's 2008. Much has changed in movie making world and they give us bigger, better and more over the top movies all the time. It's very hard to compete with that. Also, i agree this film is made too late. We are still remembering Indy in the 30's, chasing Nazi's. But it's the late 50's now and we must understand that time does not stand still. The world has changed. Yes, the Russians are now the bad guys, what did you expect, more Nazi's? And yes, there was much ado about nuclear testing and aliens in the 50's, so why not use this for an Indy movie? I think it was not a bad idea at all. But we have to remember that it is 20 YEARS LATER! And sadly, some of us find that hard to accept, cause honestly, we were all hoping on another 30's style movie.I compare this movie with 'Doom'. After the giant success of 'Raiders', this movie was a bit of a pain and totally smashed by the critics. No Nazi's, weird voodoo stuff, an irritating Chinese boy, a more irritating Mrs Spielberg, ripping out hearts and chilled monkey brains(?). But through the years it got many fans (including myself, this was my first Indy). So i think this is going to happen to 'Skull' as well. Which is good, cause if Mr Spielberg makes an Indy 5, that one must be really great then. But please, do not wait 19 years again.. Oh, and loose the aliens too please.. It was fun for once, but don't do it again.Indy, i give you a 7 out of 10 for 'Skull' because, no, 'Skull' is sadly not what i expected, but you're still my hero and i forgive you.*puts Temple Of Doom in laptop, for the 100st time*",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

ALIENS VS PREDATOR! I know, I know...you're thinking ""That can't be possible!"" but it's true. The acting was terrible (yes I'm talking to you Harrison), the action sequences were ridiculous, and the story horrendous. Yes, some of the effects were cool, but this is 2008 and this is a huge motion picture with a huge budget to accompany it so that's to be expected.

1819,ask-the-unicorn,A unicorn's perspective on this most excellent film,9,22 May 2008,"This is a most difficult film to review, and even though I am a talented and experienced film reviewer with many years of practice in my diary, this is the first time I am writing a film review on the INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY for everyone to see so I am a little nervous! I will begin with a few preliminary thoughts:1. There are no unicorns in this film! How disappointing. I really do feel that Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg are neglecting wonderful character and story opportunities by ignoring our fine species.2. I wonder if Indy will be less afraid of Our Snake Friends now that one of them has saved his life? I hope so.3. Young Mr. Shia LaBeouf sure is dreamy!! Gosh, he can crack my whip any time!4. Oooowwweeeee! FIRE ANTS FIRE ANTS FIRE ANTS EW EW EW GROSS!!! Now some thoughts with SPOILERS! Be careful, there are SPOILERS ahead!!! Right here in fact there are some spoilers: Some people at the cinema were very upset with this film. You may be, too. It all depends, I do indeed think, on whether or not you can accept SPACE ALIENS in an Indiana Jones film.I personally am quite fond of space aliens as a film and literature subject so I was quite OK with this.However, even if you are not predisposed to liking space aliens as I am, I do think they are a wonderful subject for this film.You see, just as the first three Indiana Jones films were an homage to the adventure films and matinée serials of the ""1930s"" and ""1940s"", so this film is an homage to the Cold War-influenced films of the 1950s! The aliens in Cold War films were meant to be symbols of COMMUNISTS whom are also known as RUSSIANS and whom we did not like during the Cold War (because we were at a cold war with them during the time period). Just as Cate Blanchett's most lovely Russian character is hoping to use mind control to sneak up on Americans and change the way they think to the Russian way, so were people afraid that aliens were secretly infiltrating society! Indeed in this movie, the aliens were a COLLECTIVE MIND which is awesome because you can totally be telepathic and talk to each other in secret but which is also similar to Communism where everyone thinks the same.I think that we should be grateful to America and to Russia for having a Cold War and thus giving us new and interesting subjects for film!

1820,awilder_53,John Williams was the most consistent roll-player in Indy.,7,22 May 2008,"First off, let me start out by saying that I am a huge Indiana Jones fan. I have been for as long as I can remember. This means that I am obviously biased and loved the movie. But, for this review I will try and remain unbiased.For starters, I've heard many people complain, ""Oh, this story isn't even based on facts like the other Indy movies. It changes too much...blah blah."" OK, first of all it IS an actual myth. No one knows a lot about it (the Crystal Skull) or it's origin, which just left room for Lucas and Spielberg to take a little creative license and go in any direction with this movie as they pleased. And secondly, not all Indy's movies were about timeless artifacts that everyone knows about. What about the Temple of Doom? Is the Sankara Stone really that prominent an artifact? I don't think so. Keep your mind open and you'll enjoy this movie.Okay, obviously, Harrison Ford has still got it. The man in the Fedora is still the Indy he once was, just with a few more gray hairs. He's one of the greatest actors of our time, and he brought Indy back to the big-screen in a huge way, and was very VERY good throughout the entire movie. And might I add, he did most of his own stunts. Impressive. He may be 19 years older but he's just as good as ever. I must say, the duo between Shia and Harrison in the film was great. I was pleasantly surprised by how well LeBeouf actually did. I never got sick of him, shockingly enough.A few of my biggest disappointments were how far-fetched some of the scenes were, some of the dialog, and the over-use of special effects. The scene where Indy survives a nuclear explosion in a refrigerator...I mean, c'mon, that's just laughable. Who thought of that? Oh, and what about the scene where ""Mutt"" gets caught in the canopy above and decides he's George of the Jungle and swings from vine to vine across the forest? My jaw dropped when I saw that; just ridiculous. Although the acting was all around good, some of the dialog was just terrible. I don't know who told Lucas and Spielberg that it sounded good, because they must've been deaf to believe such a thing! I was disappointed mainly because I was expecting a sequel to the other three Indiana Jones movies, but this was completely different. And the snake/quicksand scene, yes it was funny, but God that thing was so fake it made me laugh more at how stupid it looked rather than laughing at the humorous dialogue. Another thing...When Indy and Mutt are conversing later in the film after they found out about the ""big news"", it was just corny. I think the point was for it to be humorous, but that attempt sadly failed. Although the dialogue wasn't always the best, Harrison Ford and Shia LeBeouf did pull it off quite remarkably. The same can't be said for Karen Allen, who I felt was a little sketchy in her acting, too happy, and too quick to jump back in a relationship...C'mon, that was even more far-fetched than the aliens! No woman would do that! ha ha. BUT Karen's smiling face and tough girl routine wasn't always bad. When she first entered the scene I loved her. The waterfall scene was one of my favorites. --Very funny! It was funny and a pleasant reunion, but smiling during battle where your beloved son and the man you are infatuated with are fighting over cars for their lives is just annoying. You can be serious sometimes Karen, I promise.And Cate Blanchett's character was just annoying. I didn't feel she was intimidating at all and I don't understand why Indy was ever scared of her at all...Maybe he wasn't. Maybe it was just the mass amounts of KGB constantly surrounding her, but she was not intimidating at all. More like a fly buzzing around your ear. It just won't leave you alone. I just wish Indy's nemesis appeared more worthy of his time.The over-use of technology was sickening. I would rather have the melted wax head from Raiders rather than obviously fake gophers, monstrous ants, and swinging monkeys being flung into trees in this movie...Come one here, give us a break. You guys are better than that. I was praying before this movie was released that Lucas wouldn't attempt to do with it what he did to Star Wars 1-3...And that's the over-use of CGI...Which unfortunately did happen in this movie. I was half expecting Darth Vader to appear at any moment. I just felt Lucas and Spielberg are talented enough to not have to rely on CGI and special effects. Shame, shame you two.Overall, most of my disappointment came from the behind the scenes crew. The movie was enjoyable, action-packed, and funny. I liked the change of scenery from the 30's and 40's to the late 50's. And aliens...Area 51...Roswell...Yup, it's all in there. It may not sound like a good plot to surround your story by, but I felt that it all intertwined well, and I liked the story and the fact that it had to do with big issues and controversy's of that time. No fear, the aliens come in peace; they were nowhere near being the worst part of the film.Lastly...Please PLEASE do not let there be a Henry Jones III spin-off with Shia LeBeouf. If Indy passes the hat to the ""greaser"" I'd just throw a fit. I would hate, absolutely HATE to see Shia take over this franchise. If it ain't Indy, it ain't worth it. So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed and will continue hoping that the scene where Indy takes his hat from Mutt before he can put it on at the end of the movie symbolizes just that...The end.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1821,virtualpepe,Fantastic :),10,22 May 2008,"After reading more reviews today and seeing the flick last nite, i really canot see what people are complaining about. The latest installment in the Indy franchise was fantastic from start to finish. Just let me get this out of the way... Like Star Wars I am a big fan of the Indy series... Indy 4 was never going to be just like the previous movies and just like the preqels to Star Wars. I went into Indy expecting things to have changed. Movies made in the 80s just have a different feel to them. I am sure you can imagine what i am trying to say.While watching the movie is does stretch believability but really what are people expecting. I always like to leave the brain with the usher and just enjoy what is being shown.Harrison Ford being 65 did a fantastic job reprising one of his roles he had made his own. While there are rumours of a fifth, and i am not gonna be surprised if it gets made, and Ford can still pull off Indy then i say go for it.John Williams again weaves his magic with the films score and you will definitely pick up some tunes that appeared in the earlier movies. It is amazing that this soundtrack brings back so many feelings and excitement.Karen Allen did a great job bring back Marion and Shia did a good job as well. I was a little sceptical about Shia but I think he did a great job and will do a good job going on if you catch my drift.I stayed away from most of the hype and really didn't try to analyse anything before seeing the movie.

1822,teenagecobain-1,Absolutely Atrocious,2,23 May 2008,"I'd preface my comments by saying, like all the naysayers out there, that I've been a fan of Indiana Jones all my life, since the first time I saw Raiders years ago, but truly that doesn't matter here. What matters is that this film DOES NOT FEEL LIKE AN INDY FILM. Sure it's got fast-paced action spectacle, wise-cracks, etc, but the characters and the entire atmosphere of the trilogy, a pantheon of attitude, integrity, and realism, is lot in KoCS in a haze of tremendous amounts of over the top CGI (a gigantic flying saucer?), pathetic sound-stage masking, a general abandonment on Spielberg's part of any of his classic film-making techniques, and under-developed characters that denigrate a truly epic and engrossing series of films. Indiana Jones doesn't act like Indy (not Harrison Ford's fault, but the fault of the direction and the screenplay), walking through every fight scene, only using his whip twice, solving puzzles with ""National Treasure"" like ridiculousness, and gleefully reuniting with Marion (who has none of the feistyness or attitude of Raiders, instead reverting to nonstop grinning and almost sexist stereotypes) in scenes oddly reminiscent of the pathetic romantic comedies Indy films always served as the exact antithesis of. Unfathomably ludicrous stunts, like Shia's characters Tarzan-like jungle swinging with an army of poorly rendered CGI monkeys, or Marion's apparently intentional jump of a army vehicle into the saving arms of a gigantic seemingly elastic tree, and Indy surviving a nuclear explosion in a refrigerator detract further from any hope of this much anticipated film getting back on track (after a decent first 20 minutes) and the general lack of cohesion in the plot (characters literally appear in locations) quickly becomes genuinely unnerving. What's left at the end of the 2 hour plus running time is a popcorn-flick that is a sad portrait of what blockbusters have become, and a tired, silly parody of a series of classic films that will be forever marred by its addition.I can only hope, in my heart of hearts, that for Indy's sake, no sequel or spin-off results from a film critics across the country (much to the dismay of fans all over the world) have inexplicably labeled decent. As an Indy fan that would've been hard to disappoint here (to me, almost any Indy is good Indy), George Lucas and Steven Spielberg truly couldn't have disappointed me (or the booing midnight crowd in Novi, MI) more. Save your money.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1823,mwmorgan1956,Be Careful What You Wish For....,7,22 May 2008,"You may end up wishing you had wished for something else. There's no question that this is a good movie. It's produced by George Lucas and directed by Stephen Spielberg after all, so how bad can it be? But if you're looking for the same degree of entertainment in the first three Indy movies, you're likely to be disappointed. You might be tempted to believe that Lucas and Spielberg are getting lazy in their late middle age. The movie opens in 1957, the setting made obvious by a radio playing Elvis' 'Hound Dog.' In the first few minutes, we meet a curvaceous, dark-haired, but rather sterile, Soviet officer, Irina Spalko, (Cate Blanchett) and her henchmen blasting their way into military base with kidnappees Indy (Harrison Ford) and George ""Mac"" McHale (Ray Winstone) in tow. They are looking for an alien mummy that Indy recovered years before, and which the US government subsequently seized and hid in the same cavernous hanger where the 'Lost Ark' had been stored, (alluded to by a glimpse of the ark in a broken crate.) Mac turns out to be a double agent, selling his services to the highest bidder; the Russians. He turns on Indy just as our hero gets the drop on the Ruskies. After a chase scene with trucks, bullets, and broken crates flying around, Indy escapes sans alien mummy. Good for Indy! Right? Wrong! Enter two FBI agents who believe Indy helped, albeit under duress, enemies of the US capture highly classified alien technology. Later, Indy is teaching a college archeology class when the dean pulls him out and tells him he has been suspended. Suddenly, his career and reputation hang by a thread. Angry, but helpless to fight his plight, Indy almost goes job hunting in Europe, but is stopped by a Harley-riding greaser named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) who gives Indy a letter written in a strange ancient language. Their meeting is interrupted by more Soviet spies. Their escape sets them adventuring in South America to figure out what the letter means, with Spalko and her goon squad close behind. Another brief capture reveals Mutt as Indy's son by none other than old flame Marion Ravenwood, played by the aging but still ruggedly lovely Karen Allen, who also joins the party, if only for the chance to strangle Indy for leaving her stranded at the altar while pregnant. Professor Oxley (John Hurt), who penned the cryptic letter and is in possession of an oddly shaped crystal skull whose psychic power has driven him mad, also joins the party. After a fiery jungle escape, they find the answer to the mystery in a labyrinthine jungle temple. The aliens turn out to be from another dimension, not just another planet, and the temple contains their crystalline skeletons, one of which is missing ALL TOGETHER NOW its skull! Inside the temple, Spalko's shows up, revealing her belief that the skull can control people's minds over a great distance. She has been sent to collect it and turn it into a weapon which the Soviets will use against the world. Indy and crew must thwart Spalko's plot and return the skull to its alien skeleton. A chase scene with the Russians in a de-roofed truck and Indy's gang in a battered Russian amphibious vehicle is fun and exciting, with the skull changing possession every few seconds like a football being constantly fumbled and recovered in a hopelessly mucked offensive play against an equally inept defense. And you'll love the bit where (a very phobic) Indy must grab onto a long, slithery live snake and use it like a rope to pull himself free of a gas pocket sand trap that is sucking him down like quicksand. From the beginning, Ford and LaBeouf display a chemistry that sparkles with tension and affection, and the bits between them are funny and touching without interfering in the main plot. Allen, still very much a hottie despite her age, reprises her role as Indy's feisty and contrary love interest. Hurt is lovable as the brilliant but insane Professor Oxley, mumbling incoherently and making hand gestures that only Indy can translate into puzzle-solving clues. Blanchett is delightfully wicked as the evil Spalko, but Winstone is rather stale as Mac McHale. For all its good points, this movie just doesn't work as well as I would have liked. The plot, centered on an alien civilization from another dimension, complete with spinning flying saucer spaceship, is more befitting an episode of The X Files than a Lucas/Spielberg/Ford big-budget spectacular. And while the action scenes are many, they are relatively short, apparently to make time for plot exposition and explanatory dialog. This may have been done deliberately, to lighten the physical load on the fit-but-aging Ford and Allen. But the trade-off feels too much like a trade-down, leaving us wanting more and feeling cheated when the scenes end too soon. This movie promises much, and indeed delivers on much of its potential. But Lucas and Spielberg didn't take it as far as they could have, and we are left feeling that the movie, though well thought out, isn't complete. I think after all George and Stephen have accomplished in their long and storied careers, we have the right to expect better of them. They are the film industry's best. They could have done so much more with Crystal Skull than they did, but they let their imaginations run out too soon. This installment of the Indy series will be the huge summer blockbuster it was intended to be, and it's certainly one of the most fun movies you are likely to see this year. But don't buy your tickets having talked yourself into believing that it's a 'great' movie. Maybe we couldn't have wished for more, but in the end, we are left still wishing.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1825,paul-christou,Why wasn't Frank Darabont's original script used!!!,4,22 May 2008,"What a major, major disappointment. They have been trying to actively make this movie for the past 10 years with many script revisions. Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile) submitted a script for Indiana Jones that I myself read about 2-3 years ago. Why in the world did they not use his script or something similar to it? Frank's script was actually quite good and involved Indy searching for Noah's Ark. The script reunited Indy with Marion and involved Indy globetrotting the world in search of his son who was kidnapped. It involved Indy searching for clues on his son's whereabouts. Also, there were supernatural elements involving Noah's Ark but they were subtle and mysterious. Now, guys...doesn't THAT sound like a better script than the garbage that was thrust upon us with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Seriously, the disappointment I feel is so immense right now that I just wanna slap George Lucas. This is the Jar Jar Binks of the Indiana Jones films. George Lucas may have had talent in the 80's, but not anymore. He has completely lost it. An important thing to me when I watch a film is BELIEVEABILTY within the context of the film. Now, unbelievable events in a film are OK with me, as long as the story sets them up that way. Crystal Skull did not do that. There are so many unbelievable scenes that are out of context that it totally takes you out of the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I mean come on...Indy survives a nuclear blast in a lead refrigerator. Who thought this scene was a good idea? It insults the intelligence of moviegoers...it is an unbelievable event that DOES NOT BELONG in the movie. It's was one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever witnessed. It should have been a deleted scene on the upcoming INDY 4 DVD (wait...strike that...it should have never been put on film). Don't get me started on the Mutt Tarzan scene when our boy Mutt swings in the trees like Tarzan along with his CGI monkey pals. ***END SPOILER***I knew this movie was in trouble from the first frame showing those damn CGI prairie dogs. George Lucas...please retire. You have ruined the Star Wars legacy and now you have ruined Indiana Jones.Oh...and if you think this is coming from someone who hates Indiana Jones movies...Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie of ALL TIME...I saw it 12 times IN THEATRES and over 200 times on DVD. This movie was not made for the fans...it was made by and for George Lucas' ego. Steven Spielberg...you are better than this.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1826,zbwest89,Disappointment on so many levels.,2,22 May 2008,"I am a die hard Indiana Jones fan. I want to start out by saying that. I went to the fourth film, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", expecting to see whit, action, and genuine intrigue. I expected a great script delivered effortlessly by an all-star cast all amidst a fresh and captivating plot.I saw nothing of the sort. Installment number four in the Indy series came complete with a half-baked script full of attempted one-liners, CGI all over the place, and a plot that left, and still leaves me, at a loss for words. The all-star cast was probably the only thing that could have salvaged the film, but even Ford and Blanchett fell through the the gaping holes in the script. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the textbook definition of a sequel that rides the coat-tails of it's predecessors. I thought that I was having deja vue in the theater, when in reality, entire scenes from the previous three movies were seemingly recreated in the fourth. There was a truck chase scene in the woods, there was a warehouse full of boxes, there was a scene in which Indy was teaching students at a college... among others. Not only were these scenes present, but I had trouble at times figuring out if I was indeed watching the new film or one of the older ones.The first three Indiana Jones movies worked because they all teeter-tottered on the line of reality and fiction. There was always a supernatural something or other (the arc, the grail, the shankara stones), but at the same time there was a groundingly realistic side to the film. This line between reality and myth/legend/sci-fi, when see-sawed upon, correctly, works in a film because the viewer can really believe that the outlandish and unbelievable events could maybe actually happen. Crystal Skull has a VERY overdeveloped sci-fi foundation in it's plot, and as such this viewer left the theater thinking one word, hokey.Save your money, save your time, and save your image of Indiana Jones. Don't go see this film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1827,lamona,"Disbelief, suspended.",6,22 May 2008,"It's not the Indy of old, that's for sure, but c'mon, you have to expect that. My bone to pick is the geographical and cultural inaccuracies. First of all, Nazca is PERUVIAN, not Mexican, so there's no reason why there should be Mexican guitar music playing when Indy and Mutt arrive in the southern Peruvian city. Sure, they to temper it by throwing in faint quena touches, but it's Mexican music, no doubt. Look, I know it's a movie and fiction and blah blah blah, but doesn't Hollywood feel any sort of cultural responsibility, both to those cultures and to the American public? It seems hokey and wrong to lump Central and South American cultures into one. But oh yeah, it's Hollywood we're talking about...Also, since when does it storm Kansas-tornado-style in a desert-bound region? If that's the kind of weather near Nazca, those lines (which are actually amazing and I'm glad they got exposure with this film) would've been washed out long ago.And finally: Why are Peruvians speaking Maya? I guess perhaps in the Amazon...but, erm, seems kind of a stretch. All of this seems inconsequential for a blockbuster, but kind of important on a franchise based on archeology, no?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1829,desgres,*We needed Spielberg to be more selfish & less fearful*,6,23 May 2008,"Watched the movie last night at the local cinema and have had time to sleep on it & I can help but feel this movie has been made out of fear, fear that everyone was getting too old and needed to do something,On a comic-con web cast Spielberg stated 'I'm making this movie for you guys' and we all thought GREAT!, now I realise how risky this can be , making a movie to just please an audience can tear out the heart(Mola Ram reference).Spielberg & Lucas are the masters at their craft. Can anyone remember seeing Raiders in the theatres, granted I was much ,much younger, but there was a balance of Adventure,Horror,Comedy,Action & Story which gave us so much pleasure.Raiders was a film regulators nightmare, but so much pleasure for us, remember seeing Forrestals face peeling from the spikes in the first 5 minutes, spiders over backs & melting faces when the Ark opened, FANTASTIC.Remember in the next film how Indy was so dapper & daring , with the white tux ""Last night one of your boys tried to take him etc,etc"" Again Spielberg pushed the boundaries so much so that the virtually all of the UK have never actually seen Mola Ram slide his hand inside the guys chest, due to being chopped for UK audiences.The new movie is GOOD , trouble is it's not GREAT, the movies before were masterpieces where this movie is more of an interpretation that has predicted the objections films regulators will have & took the steps beforehand, playing it safe , I cant believe some of the dialogue in the new movie. Indy at one point cried ""Someone is going to get hurt!"" while on the back of the bike ! , this is not the Indy I know , Indy to me is the smart ass who is incredibly likable, knows his history and almost becomes the narrator at the necessary parts explaining to his companions (and us) what the story is. We then become enthralled as Indy carries out his quests.There wasn't enough of this in the new movie, It became the 'Popcorn' movie, a movie just for us just as Spielberg promised, what we really craved was Spielberg movie that he was more selfish with, his kind of movie. Forget how comfortable we are , get back to frightening us and giving comic relief, the old biblical stories are great , fear of God stuff. Go as gory as need be and than have the fights with the regulators to get it on screens. I hope this wont be Indy's last outing , I don't buy the 'too old' crap, as Harrison is the old guy but who can still crack it.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1830,in_full_voice,Nowhere near as bad as fan boys say it is,7,23 May 2008,"OK people. Let's get one thing settled. Comments about over the top stunts and setups should be taken with a grain of salt. All of the Indy movie set pieces are over the top, that's what makes them Indy movies.I thought the latest entry was a very competent addition to the original trilogy. Not as good as Raiders, but as good as The Last Crusade and miles ahead of Temple of Doom. The action set pieces were as breathtaking as the originals, and the fact that they were filmed in camera as opposed to in the computer was refreshing. It's sad that the people who bash KOTCS for having dull stunts are also moaning and whining because they aren't as exciting as todays stunt pieces. (which rely heavily on CGI and MTV style editing. The fact that Spielberg extends his shots goes to show how well thought out the chases are. He doesn't rely on snapshot editing to induce a false sense of excitement.Those who claim to be lifelong fans, and complain about Indy surviving impossible situations must have forgotten about hanging onto a submarine while it takes what would be two days to reach it's destination, skydiving/cliff diving in a raft, and beating a truckful (and tankful) of armed Nazis with only a six shot revolver, a rock and his fists.The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, is popcorn entertainment. Escapist fun, and a nod to the 50's sci-fi movies as much as the originals were nods to the Republic serials. Nothing more. It isn't a documentary, it' a MOVIE! Yes it has flaws, like lack of characterization for a man of Hurt's caliber, and the monkeys. (could have been handled better) but so do the first three movies.So I urge anyone who has a sense of humor, sense of adventure, and a sense of fun to go out and enjoy the movie, and don't let people who have preconceived notions of what should have been filmed dissuade you.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1831,crikawibig,Complete waste of time,1,23 May 2008,"At first, like every other Spielberg fan, I was excited to see this movie. I was immediately disappointed. There was absolutely NO CHARACTER OR STORY DEVELOPMENT in this movie. We first see Indy being released from the trunk of a car at Area 51. We aren't told how he was kidnapped by the Russians. We also are not given any background on ANY of the characters. To the best of my knowledge, none of these characters or relationships were covered in the movies or the Young Indy series. The only background info we have is from Raiders with regard to his relationship with Marion. I can't imagine what Lucas and Spielberg were thinking. It had potential. The problem is, we were just given the outline of the movie.

1832,wickedoz-1,Disappointing,4,23 May 2008,"Can't believe some people have given this movie a 10, they must work for Paramount because this movie is nowhere near a ten. If this was the 1st Indiana movie made, i think it would have been the last. Don't really want to write any more about it but apparently i have to write at least ten lines. Which is a waste of time like the movie. Whoever came up with the idea that you have to write 10 lines of text to make a ""comment"" should be shot. It no longer becomes a comment but instead becomes a speech. But, thems the rules, so here goes. I think this movie was just a $190 million nostalgic trip for Spielberg and Lucas with one reference after another to b movies and the news of the times (1957). From Tarzan, nuclear sites, aliens, Roswell to the Wild One and Marlon Brando. Even for an Indiana movie the level of implausibility goes over the top.

Once again George Lucas managed to rape an ancient successful movie franchise..The mutilation of Indiana Jones is really mind-blowing. If you thought the three new Star Wars movies were pieces of crap, you'll poop yourself laughing watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull..I can rant on about how much Hollywood surprises me year after year, one box office hit more horrible then the other, but chances are when you're reading this, you're already on that same level with me. Therefore here's a little list to exactly this movie is blood boiling bad..*Spoiler Alert* *1: Indiana Jones moving as an old hunchbacked man (except for when his stunt-double or CGI kicks in): -1 *2: Russians instead of Nazi's: -2 *3: Full platoon of Russians in the middle of the United States, and breaking into a ""high-security"" base (guarded by only 2 or 3 American soldiers) without getting caught or stopped or attacked in Any way: -2 From here on out the movie kinda gets going, although I did regress to my summer of 2007 trauma, when Shia ""Transformers"" LeBeouf was introduced.. Just when I got over this sudden head-ache, there it was.. The absolute slaying of Indiana Jones..*4: Aliens... -1000 :| The female Russian officer even pulls out a real alien head, from the Roswell alien, supposedly stolen from the warehouse in the intro of the movie...I can't even comment on the ending.

Whats wrong with a good old fashioned antique? Extra-terrestrials? In Indiana Jones? Come off it! Ridiculous!The comedy was farcical.

Yet, I could still hear people in the cinema laughing (Just because they knew they were meant to I guess)The action finally got going half way through with a jungle car chase which lifted my spirits! But honestly, i was never even remotely tense!Other points: -Characters scenes were recycled and clichéd such as the typical greedy guy who would rather try and take all the treasure than save himself... did they really have to follow the same old clichéd stereotypes? -At the start, when they were all at the military base, the set, background, cars and uniforms all looked like they were fake props.

1837,jpielak-1,Not worth the years of deliberating on the screenplay.,2,23 May 2008,"I'm a huge fan of Indiana Jones. 37 years old, loved Ark, and I think Crusade even better. Crystal was years in the making, debating over the screenplay...I only assumed this would come out as a piece of art, something to eclipse the others in the series and prepare the handoff to the next Jones. But it didn't come close. The key problems in my opinion: 1. Harrison Ford has gotten old and tired, which mainly were evident in his facial expressiveness and dialogue. The eyes weren't bright, he carried a fairly consistent scowl or frown throughout, and any attempt at humor didn't match physically. His energy level wasn't there, and the voice reflected it..very monotone, hardly 'engaged' with his peers on screen. This was more of the stiff Jack Ryan than the charismatic Indiana or Han.2. Karen Allen (Marion) and Ray Winstone (Mac) seemed like forced characters...like the story came first, and they plugged the people in. The original movies felt like the story moved around the characters. Did it have to be Marion? Another dusted off character that had a lot of screen time, but had absolutely no dynamic presence whatsoever. No chemistry at all, and that kiss was awkward. Would have been better off creating an old fling with a better back story than 'we were a good fit' Mac played the greedy traitor. Carried a lot of screen time as well. Flat and completely typical. No contribution.3. The reward was too outlandish and complicated to pull the audience in. We wanted a good story, not to turn up the volume on the prize and find a good opp for some CGI. Crystal skeletons,look into the eyes, cmon.4. Many details were assumed or blown off. Shia (Mutt) used terms like 'PO'd' in the 50's. After the chase through the school, Indiana and Mutt go to Jones' home..wouldn't the bad guys have been waiting there? The movie is riddled with these kinds of gaps..I would have expected more polish.It was a fun movie for the family, but not worthy of sitting next to the others in the collection.

Now that I saw it I consider this film a complete FIASCO.I don't know why Lucas decided to go and film such a bad story. The only thing right was the acting. Poor Harrison, he did his best, but with such a storyline there was no way to save the movie.A big Boooo for you Lucas!!Once, I read a comment that portrait National Treasure as the poor man's version of Indiana Jones. IJ4 film creates the contrary effect. I felt more excitement, mystery and action in National Treasure than here!!*********ATTENTION: Following Plot and Spoilers************* Here are the main reasons that made me dislike this film:a) Indiana Jones survives an Atomic explosion by just jumping and hiding inside a fridge, which, in turn, is thrown miles away by the blast. No bad injuries, no radiation problems for him (I prefer the snakes' pit. ) b) Pancho Villa spoke Quechua? My goodness!! In this film the story writer decides to mix Mayan, Quechua and Spanish to translate other prehispanic languages. Bad History speaking!! c) When they look for the skull in the grave yard, they only fight 2 guardians whose job is to prevent people from entering that sacred place. One of the guards decides to run away when Indy shows him his gun. As simple as that!! Without any complications.d) All Indy's friends survive after falling from 3 different waterfalls, each one as big as Niagara Falls. They just get wet but remain seated inside the vehicle that transported them!! No one is lost or injured, the crystal skull remains intact. For me, this part was the worst of all.e) In this movie, it was very easy for them to get into the sacred temple. They just showed the skull to anyone in their path and everything went smooth. (It was like a VIP pass). No hiding traps, no big riddles, no big challenges of any kind.f) Did anyone see the floor of the main chamber where the other aliens are sitting? It was a representation of the Aztec's Sun Calendar Aztec's culture in Peru?

1840,Nimayea,Finally Indy's back!!,9,23 May 2008,"Indiana Jones 4... ¿Was the wait worth it? Yes! ¿Is a Master Piece? No. ¿Is it good? Oh yeah! Really good!! However, thanks to the fact that Steven Spielberg has us used to closer to perfection as possible (with a few exceptions, of course), i feel that it could have been better. As we expected, we couldn't demand that Indy made all those stunts that he did on his other adventures. Apart of being obvious that at that age he just can't do it, it would be disrespectful to the character and above all, to the audience. So far, so good, now, it wouldn't be good also that he got a gorgeous under 30 year old woman as a ""Jones girl"" because it would be bad taste as well. Adventure and excitement is what this movie has a lot (as it should be in any Indy Movie), even though certain things go a little bit off reality (like Die Hard 4.0), but is a part of any Indy movie. Another point to note here is Dr. Jones' sidekick in this adventure. Anyone who hated Shia LeBeouf in Transformers raise your hand please...ME!!!.Well, I'm sorry to tell you all that he's back on the screen. Although in this movie, his character is just ""digestible"" at certain point. What leads us to the final point. The plot. I'm not gonna tell you what is all about, but let's just say that here is where opinions break. Personnaly I think that after the other three movies and what is already done and seen in other movies as ""National Treasure"" and ""The Mummy"" and their sequels, you just couldn't ask anything more ""innovative"" than this (although they could just made up another story completely out of nothing, not based on something real, but, again, it wouldn't be Indiana Jones if it wasn't based on a history thing). I thought it was good, not as ""classic"" as the others 3, but good overall. So, if you are a fan of the previous Indiana Jones Trilogy, you just can't miss this one!! And if you want to have a good time with a movie that is not flooded with exaggerated special effects and is set at the time where they were no cell phones, nor Internet(to search for everything you need to know about the Crystal Skull, etc) I really recommend it!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1841,svinnacombe,Good to see Indy again....but a plot that falls way short of the mark,5,23 May 2008,"I reached a movie buff conclusion after the 2nd set of Star wars films. It's simply not possible to top an iconic, legendary film or series. The original can't be beat, and is next to impossible to match. Doesn't matter who directs, stars, the effects, etc - can't be done. Being sure of this in advance made the Crystal Skull easier for me to take - but I still have to be critical - because they let us down on the simple stuff. My other movie buff observation is - its ALWAYS the writing first. The STORY. The other stuff flows from that, making the film better or worse. In Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the writing failed us. The story does not hold together well and the dialog rings intermittently false throughout the film. I wanted to love the movie - but I was disappointed. When I heard they were all waiting for the ""right"" script to make another Indy film - that sounded good. But it appears that wasn't really true. I have to assume they all just decided the timing was ""right"" and it would be fun to get the old group together to do a flick - because the script was poor. The movie is more like an attempt at what an Idiana Jones adventure SHOULD look like - but with no real substance. A series of Indiana like dangerous situations and exploits strung together loosely with some attempts at humor thrown in. But no clear beginning to end plot. No disaster to avert, no one to rescue. Nothing in particular to root for... The actors seemed a bit uncomfortable to me - even Harrison Ford himself. Indy's love interest from Raiders (Marian) was underutilized and apparently a bit rusty in the acting department. She seemed to be just ""thrown in"" to add a nostalgic romantic element. The young Mutt character was well cast and did a good job with what he had to work with. The story arc regarding Indys age, his old love and young Mutt is dealt with - but could have been a better, more solid part of a more well written story. I'm glad I saw the film. I enjoyed seeing Indy again, but my hope that I'd be wanting to go again didn't pan out. It's worth only one visit - and that just to see some Indiana JonesLIKE adventures - in a story that doesn't make much sense. Sorry to break bad news to anyone who reads fan reviews - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. George - you should have fussed over the writing a bit more and Harrison - I'd have waited longer for the right script. This was a weak effort and it didn't need to be. Mr Lucas and Mr Spielberg -you surprised me on this one - and let us all down on the story. Just my opinion :) Scott (an Indy Fan).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1842,darren-rossiter-1,Great Fun,8,23 May 2008,This movie was great fun. Sure there are unbelievable stunts and actions sequences. But that is no different than the previous three movies; which some people seem to have forgotten. The stunts were every bit as entertaining as they were unbelievable.I'll even agree that some of the actors seemed to be having a bit too much fun when their lives were in peril but this isn't high drama. Its a fun escapist adventure movie meant to appeal to the whole family. On that account it strongly succeeds.Others complain that Indy is not so strong and independent as he was in the previous films. I guess they weren't happy with the passage of time for Harrison Ford and the move to the 1950's showing him aging gracefully. Harrison once again did a great job in the clothes of Indiana Jones. Maybe those complaining would have been happier if a new actor was cast to play Indiana Jones and again set the movie back in the 1930's. But I'm sure they would complain about this also.I will gladly add this movie to my trilogy when it becomes available on disc.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1843,zach_bogner,What happened?,4,1 June 2008,"Indiana Jones is a legacy. The first three movies are great, and I was expecting a lot when I went to the movies. But when the movie was over, I was in total shock. It was a complete disappointment, and it sorta sucked. Granted, the acting was very good. Even though he's a lot older, Harrison Ford was awesome, and didn't let me down there. Shia Labeouf was pretty good too, and he's probably gonna be really famous someday.So up to there the movie was OK. But the scrip was terrible. Everything in it was unrealistic. Hiding in a fridge will not protect you from a fatal bomb. Especially if the fridge is flung into the sky and travels at least a mile. If you ride a motorcycle into a college library, you're gonna get arrested. If you are supposed to grab onto a snake and your son swings it around about 20 times, it's going to bite you. If your dad's car is about to be pushed off a cliff while you're hanging from a vine, you will most likely not be able to catch up by pretending you're Tarzan, and a tribe of monkeys will most definitely not follow you and attack the enemy. Even if your vehicle is designed for water, it's not going to keep floating after it goes down 2 waterfalls, and you're probably not going to survive 3 waterfalls, especially if the last one looks like its 5 times the size of the other 2. And you can't get rid of magnetic fields by putting a burlap sack on the magnetic thing.But the worst part of all is the aliens (big spoiler). Spielberg tried to turn Indiana Jones into E.T. Huh? Indy and aliens don't fit too well together. The last third of the movie is terrible. If there were really aliens, it isn't very likely that they would be made entirely of crystal. Or that they could magically hide a spaceship under a Mayan village and nobody would notice it. And Oxley explained where the aliens went by telling us that they went into ""the space between spaces"". What? In general, this can be an okay movie if you ignore the unrealistic stuff (and the aliens) and just focus on the action. If you don't do that, you're in for a disappointment.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1844,PuppyBearSF,Don't waste your money! Jumps shark in first 10 minutes!,3,23 May 2008,"I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it but I must warn them all the same. The story is wholly unbelievable. In the first 10 minutes there are: Aliens. Surviving atomic blasts inside a refrigerator. The refrigerator being blasted miles, landing, and rolling without being crushed or opening.Even Cate Blanchett's superb acting couldn't save this piece of crap.The story takes every easy, melodramatic, kitschy opportunity it can find. There is no real emotional storyline. Just gag after gag.There is too much reliance on action sequences and FX. The falls are supposed to be on Amazon but are actually the Igauzu Falls on the Parana River. Indy identifies killer ants as ""siafu"" which are only found in Africa and Asia, not the jungles of Brazil or Peru. Completely unbelievable and lacking real drama.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1845,kcballer1986,Another Great Indy Flick,9,24 May 2008,"The film starts off with a bang and never falls down from there. Sure two scenes needed to be taken out or re-done (tarzen and the final alien bit), but other than that this was another great Indiana Jones movie with possibly one of the greatest action sequences ever in the jungle chase scene.What I don't get is the criticism for this film. Someone compared it to Phantom? What? That film relied only on CGI sequences and terrible new characters, this one didn't even suffer from dialogue problems which for the most part was actually not half bad. The acting was good, although Cate sometimes pushes the envelope, but wow is Shia making something of himself.Now where this film gets the most props is in the action department. Spielberg truly is a master of directing action scenes as they are quickly edited, but still establish a mini-story in each shot before they transfer to the situation in another moment. Two of the scenes in here, the area 51 scene and the jungle chase scene actually might be the some of the greatest action scenes ever crafted. They have that awesome Indy style flowing through them, as well as an old-fashion feel, just with newer technology.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1846,cenawm23,Dr. Jones,10,24 May 2008,When i first saw previews for this movie i expected a less exhilarating adventure considering Harrison's age but i was wrong. when i went and saw this movie all i could say was WOW!

1848,nick-haywood,Indiana Jones and the Waste of Money,3,24 May 2008,"Right, I'm a long time Indie fan, loved the whole series from Raiders through to Last Crusade, so when I first heard about a fourth Indie film is was pretty happy... but then, having seen how old Harrison Ford is, I was also pretty dubious that he'd still be able to make an action film to the level that we've come to expect from Indiana Jones.And guess what? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull falls way, way short of any of the previous films.Without revealing any of the ludicrous plot, here's a quick run down of what, to my mind, are the films main flaws: The pacing, frankly, is so slow you have to wonder if Spielberg wasn't on serious amounts of Valium. Right from the start the whole film just drags... the action sequences in particular aren't anywhere near the fast paced non-stop stuff we've come to expect from and Indiana Jones film, let alone anything more recent.One example is the car chase through the jungle, which one hopes will be akin to the superb truck fight in Raiders or the tank/truck/horse sequence in Last Crusade, but there's less fists thrown here than at a CND love-in... and the set-up for the very brief set pieces is so obvious that you can guess what's going to happen way before the film eventually gets to showing you.Speaking of getting to the point ahead of the film, I guessed the ending within the first five minutes, as anyone with half a brain will too. The entire film is littered with supposed 'hints' but Spielberg sure as hell isn't M. Night Shyamalan... so his plot devices stick out like a pork chop at a bar mitzvah. And worse than that, they're often only in the movie to justify some bit later on... such as Shia LaBeouf's character, despite being a prep-school drop-out moulding himself as James Dean, he still mastered fencing... a fact we're told early on, and then of course he puts his skills to use against Kate Blanchett's evil Irina Spalko.Actually, I say Spalko is evil, purely because she's not on Indie's side, so she must be the baddie, but I've not seen a more two-dimensional baddie outside of a Disney cartoon. Even her musclebound henchman comes across as being no worse than any office worker with a Sunday morning hangover... and of course they all meet a gruesome, unfortunate demise.Indie himself is well, less like Indie than River Phoenix's portrayal of a young Indie in Last Crusade... he just sounds tired and old, besides looking tired and old. And Karen Allen, who is easily recognisable in her reprise as Marion from Raiders, is showing her age too...The music score is at best non-existent and at worst, which is most of the time, completely unsuitable to what little action is taking place on the screen. Where's the score timed perfectly to match the horse's hoofs as it prances down the hill in Last Crusade? Where's the stirring the march as Indie pulls on his last reserves to finish the job? We all know music in a film sequence makes the scene all the more exciting, but Spielberg has missed all of that this time around. He might as well have had Blue Danube playing most of the time.. perhaps he even did... as time sure as hell seemed to take a long time to pass as Blanchett and LaBeouf laboriously swung swords.I'm left wondering if Spielberg was thinking that Indie fans might be slipping into the same old age that is claiming Harrsion Ford and perhaps we're not as able to keep up with the pace of a fast action film... and maybe we can't always figure out plots as well as we used to? It certainly seems that way as Indie, (both the character AND the film) plodded along to an unsurprising and completely unbelievable 'climax'. Throughout the entire film we're spoon-fed information, just in case we hadn't sussed it... and in case THAT fails, we're normally shown what's coming up as well, just to be on the safe side... watch the car chase sequence along the cliff, you'll see what I mean.To be fair to Spielberg, the crappy editing might've thrown a few slow-witted viewers off the plot for perhaps 30 seconds or so, but with this many holes in the plot and the heavy smattering of stupidly obvious plot devices, it's hard to see how anyone can have been wondering what was going on, other than where the hell an entertaining Indiana Jones film had gone...In short, having just taken the family to see this, I've certainly wasted my £28.... I'd probably even feel hard done by if I'd saved this for rental... but at least having seen it now, I won't waste my cash buying it on DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1849,basedontheparameters,It was A LOT BETTER than people say,10,24 May 2008,"I think it's a wonderful film, a LOT better than the second Indy. I think people aren't judging this one fairly. The ending wasn't believable, but is the Lost Ark believable? The Sankara stones? The Holy Grail? The ghost? I DON'T THINK SO. It was funny and I think it was an excellent movie. It's certainly got a new film feel, and I think a lot of you people have a problem with that. Harrison Ford was as good as ever, it was nice to see Marion again, Shia did a good job as Henry Jones junior junior. The only thing I didn't like was how patronizing Indy was towards Ox. It wasn't made in the 80's, so what? It'll still be the first one I'll get on DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1850,wickedboi79,I want the two hours of my life back!!!,1,24 May 2008,"I grew up watching the Indiana Jones films. Everyone one of them were wonderful, smart, and original. The newest installment to the franchise is none of the above. Of course, going in I was expecting to see an older Harrison Ford, but I did not prepare myself for such horrible writing followed up by some really bad acting. I couldn't figure out what Cate Blanchett (who I love)was doing in this awful mess and looking like a drag queen on top of it all. The only descent performance was Karen Allen who made the most of what she was given. As far as a plot, it was like Indiana Jones meets The X-Files. What were these people thinking?! By the time I got to see Shia LeBeouf swinging from vines with a troop of monkeys-that help him battle the ""bad guys"" I was too done. They should have just left the series alone. With the cost of going to see a film these days, I really hope people stay away from this one.

1851,gmmgamespot,Indiana Jones 4 brings the fun back,9,24 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is just plain fun. A VERY interesting and, um, UNIQUE plot makes this one different. I think this movie is meant to make you have fun, not complain about a nuclear blast that Indiana survives. This movie wasn't made to be absolutely realistic, plus you can't go into a Jones movie expecting it to be realistic. I found the really long and awesome action scenes to be very fun, even though the plot has some holes, like Marion Ravenwood coming back. I realized she barely had any lines the entire movie. I thought all the characters were that way. Except for Indy, of course. Shia Labeouf, actually did have a pretty big part, along with Blanchett's character. I probably would've given this movie a ten if it weren't for the VERY confusing and just plain weird ending. Overall, just go to the theater and have some fun! This is not perfect, of course, but just ease up and have some movie fun.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1852,gamingbattle,"Don't listen to the negative nellies, INDY IS BACK! (SPOILERS)",9,24 May 2008,"SPOILER ALERT If you were to believe some, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a subpar entry into the Indy series at best, and ""Phantom Menace Redux"" at worst. This is just simply not the case. It is a fun movie which, while not up to the standards of Raiders or Crusade, is better then Temple of Doom and just about every single Indy imitation ever made.In the 19 years since we've last seen Indy, time has passed in his life too, entering the 1950s, when Elvis jammed, Greasers rode and A-Bombs blasted. With this, the Nazis of yesteryear are replaced by Reds. And like how the original 3 movies were send-ups of the B-movies of the 30's, this movie is a sendup of the B-movies of the 50's. This may be jarring for some people to see the gods that created the Ark replaced by Aliens straight out of CE3K, but it fits the 50's B-movie background perfectly.The acting in the movie is top-notch, Harrison Ford and Shia Lebouf have great chemistry as Indy and (SPOILER) his previously unknown son, Mutt. Karen Allen is a welcome return as Marion, who even in her relatively limited screen time is able to once again prove that she was the best ""Jones Girl"". Blanchett is able to somehow use the most ridiculous Russian accent ever and make it work, and the rest of the main cast is able to hold their own as well.If there is one complaint about Indy IV, it is that it has portions that are unbelievable even for a Indy film. Escaping a A-Bomb by jumping into a fridge, for example, or going down three straight waterfalls. Still, these provide good laughs, and are in many ways true to the 50's B-movie that they are paying homage to.So Indy is back, and let's hope he returns again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1853,monikee-1,Disappointed,4,24 May 2008,"We were very excited about this film, both my husband and I being huge fans of the original Indiana Jones movies. This movie was horrible. It was like they were trying to take the magic and the style of the originals and update it, which I don't think quite worked out. I caught myself checking my watch periodically to see when this might be over with. The whole alien thing was way too out there even for Spielberg. While the special effects and cinematography were excellent the content was less than great. Overall I would recommend this as a rental. On the upside Harrison Ford looks the best he has in years.

Great actors but with a bad script. I really give this movie an opportunity but it disappoint me in a very high level.The beginning is good, the middle is the worst and the finale is bad.

Old Characters returned and I give credit to the makers to try to bring a new freshness in Shia Leabouf, but his character just didn't work for him. The fact that this movie was set in 1957 it seemed too 21st century to me. The whole thing was just too weird to excite the young audience going to watch the film.

Of course, the original Raiders of the Lost Ark was the best and I think most Indy fans agree that Temple of Doom stunk. I certainly had my reservations about no. 4 to be sure, however, Crystal Skull felt like a classic Indy flick and I would say it was as almost as enjoyable as no. 1 and certainly as good as no. 3. My wife and I and our children are all Indy fans and we all thoroughly enjoyed this one.

Why was Karen Allen in this movie? Well I guess Karen had to show up so that the camera man could make use of his soft focus lens. I really wish they would have excluded George Lucas's fantasy land of digital effects that stood out like sore thumbs. As I was watching I kept thinking about the old films and how the script, actors, story, lighting, and clothes, had more of a natural organic feel. Really difficult to focus on the story and characters by the artificial digital appearance. Shooting an entire film in digital is definitely noticeable George. I felt like I was watching a video game with poor comedy one liners thrown in every scene. Digital technology is still not quite there and noticeable and you're more likely to pull a better performance by leaving the green screen out.What a let down.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1859,bpd69-1,"Everybody Relax, it's a fun film. Just Enjoy it!",8,24 May 2008,"Well, I just got back from the movie and I have to say that I LOVED IT!!! But by deciding to love it, I had to block a few things from my memory. SPOILERS ARE ON THE WAY just to let you know. First, things I loved: I thought the intro and the warehouse scene was fantastic as well as the nuclear bomb scene, it was very cool and I thought a great opener to the film. One of my favorite parts! Indy, acts the same, looks a little older, but pulled it off without a problem. I don't think he did anything that was out of character for a 60 year old Indy. The action scenes were awesome and the CGI during these points wasn't too exaggerated, except maybe the part where Shia is standing on both cars and plants are hitting him in the crotch. Speaking of Shia, he did a great job and the motorcycle chase scene was also very cool. I think that was my second favorite part and the fight that leads up to it. I thought the monkey scene was fun too. I liked the change Spielberg made to have music like Elvis and others, playing at certain parts of the film. It was very un-Indy-like, but worked for me and the story. The car chase scenes and quicksand scene were funny and both were my third and fourth favorite parts. It was good to have Marion back and the relationship between her and Indy was rushed, but enjoyable and she could have had more screen time, but she did a great job. The editing, sets and other actors were great. The music and sound was fantastic and all the elements of classic Indy were present. I thought Cate Blanchett was pretty good looking. The ending was awesome and well done too. Now, the things I didn't really like. The list is shorter than things I liked which is good: First off, what the hell is this crystal skull and who cares about it! Although it looks freaking awesome. It might have just been me, but I was so confused, the McGuffin really bothered me. So if you posses it you have control over its power which is psychic abilities? Wouldn't the Russians have rather had that A-Bomb and dropped it in Washington DC since they were already in the US. All the McGuffins in the series have some things we don't understand and like in Temple of Doom, nobody really cares about it, but in this installment it plays such a key spot that you can't avoid it. If someone could explain the McGuffin to me better I could love to hear about it. Next point, what is the deal with taking the skull to the temple and sticking it up on that skeleton. What did we accomplish and how does that give anyone psychic powers, it looks like it just exploded and flew away to me. Now my number one problem with this movie, that almost ruined it for me....., I love Sci-Fi almost as much as Indy movies so I was very excited for that element to be in this film. Having said that WHY DID WE HAVE TO SEE THE ALIEN??? Lucas should have seen Signs and realized that movie was ruined for the same reason. In the other Indy films we don't see God, Shiva or Christ. We just see their power. So why did we have to see an alien that looks so flipping fake and really pointless to the story. Now why exactly did the alien kill off Spalko? Was it because aliens are capitalists? I mean, she's the one who got the skull ""restored"" and then the alien kills her off! Very confusing. Was it just because she was the bad gal? These are key points for any film, especially an Indy one that had serious issues. Now to end on a happy note, I am going to go see it again next week and hopefully I will understand it much better. There were many times that I could feel my pulse racing as I watched this film and it felt sooooo good to see Indiana back in action. It made me a little sad that we hadn't seen more of him over the past 20 years. It was a good movie and I enjoyed almost all of it. And I would recommend it to anyone, plus the moment I walked out of the theater, I wanted to go in and see it again. Now to all of you...can someone better explain this skull to me and exactly what was going on at the end. I am sure that if I understood this part better I would enjoy this movie much more. I had a very very good time!!! -Bvance PS: Could someone also explain what the Russians found at the warehouse. I know it was an alien corpse, but how did that help them at all? Was it just so they knew crystal skulls really existed? I might have missed that key point.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1860,asafrash,The Indie Movie Of Indy Movies,1,25 May 2008,"Sometimes for fun i imagine how cool it would be if there was a machine that could delete a very specific memory in my brain, that way i could use the machine take all the best movies ever made and just delete the part in my mind that remembers these movies only to watch them all over again and have a real pure experience of what movie magic is all about. In the case of Crystal Skull i would gladly use the machine and write myself a note saying ""Danger:Do Not Watch! , Will Kill Beloved Indy Franchise"", this pretty much sums up what i feel about Crystal Skull.I will not go into the specifics of why this movie is so bad because frankly it doesn't work in any level, trust me , ITS BAD!.

If i could go back in time and talk to Spielberg on the day they decided to make this movie i would have quoted Henry Jones in the end of Grail when Indy was trying to reach the grail and was about to fall into the pit saying ""Steven...just let it go"" Seth",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1861,salgadoboyz,Almost Speechless,10,25 May 2008,"To really enjoy this amazing film, you need to be a fan of the series. There has been a lot of mixed reviews, they love it and hate it. Really it's Indy meets the new technology. And the overall look is gorgeous. And the storyline, is...well as good as it gets. Some people think its stupid, others think it's amazing. And some thought it was a necessity. I was one of them. This story separates the film from the rest but yet still, it is a true Indy film. And as for the cast, Ford, Allen, and LaBeouf pulled it off. Visual Effects were incredible, not too cheesy at all. And Ford can easily be said that he still kicks a**. Which just made the film even better. Indy 5? Maybe, but I know Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is being saved in the classics cabinet.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1862,lauda7,disappointed,2,25 May 2008,"I have grown up with Indiana Jones movies and they have always been inspiring and adventurous until now. I was super disappointed with the latest film which I just saw yesterday. I thought this new Indy film would be another amazing, authentic(as to the original Indy films), creative story which I could get immersed in and that would leave me wanting the story/adventure to continue. However I left the theater thinking I am glad this movie is over. I also felt I had just watched Indy meets X-Files. I am big fan of the X-Files too but I think it was a big mistake to mix the two. Tell me about far off worlds and ancient history on this earth, that is authentic Indy...not far off worlds in space and alien beings who never existed. The characters were weak and the dialog was boring. I love that the original three Indy films were to some extent shot on location and based on some reality at least in the look and feel of the film. I was sad that this film sold out to CG...you know sometimes just because you have the power of CG does not mean you need it in a film. CG is too easy to fall back on for filmmakers. To those people who have not yet seen this movie I would say, don't expect anything near the original three Indy flicks. Save ur cash for X-Files movie which is also coming out this year and is SUPPOSED to be about aliens.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1863,h-jendrian,One point for the hat and one for theme,2,25 May 2008,"Even 24 hours after I have seen this movie I am still bitterly disappointed. The magic is gone, the action is gone, the good dialogues are gone and the logic, well, the logic probably got lost somehwhere in Area 51.Summarising the movie: Indi gets captured, escapes, gets captured again, manages to escape a 2nd time ... just before he is captured again and so on. Shortly before the end he manages to escape into ""Close encounters of the third kind"" or was it ""war of the worlds"" ...Bottom line, this movie is like a severe car accident. It looks bad, you should not stare, but somehow you can not keep your eyes away.Anyways, lesson learned: If there is an Indi V - maybe in 2027 - I will wait for the free TV premiere ...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1864,loverlys1,Ick ick ick,2,25 May 2008,"Here's the thing... it was like watching a bad movie full of B movie acting.1. I thought for the first part of the movie it was like Harrison Ford wasn't sure if he was awake or dreaming and was just really cold and stumbling around for his acting props, which I think is highly unlike him. I wanted to pinch him awake and ask him to please start acting and get off autopilot... I mean it was as bad as Steven Segal on SNL forgetting his lines.2. How they ever ever ever managed to get the amazingly talented Cate Blanchett to even set foot in this film is beyond me, but whoever managed it deserves a promotion and a raise. Sadly though, she acted horribly and lost her accent on more than one occasion. I will say they didn't give her a very good character, so its not completely her fault, but yeesh... what a way to dumb yourself down. Maybe next time she will run like hell instead of taking parts like this that make her seem like a horrible actor with no talent. And whats with the blocky haircut...its just so stereotypically bad. 3. The son thing and the alien thing is so OVERUSED/PREDICTABLE and it makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I mean really.. could they not have taken all this time since the last movie and come up with something more clever and less predictable and yesterday? As soon as both story lines hit in the movie, I could have just thrown up my toenails.4. I am hugely disappointed. I even considered begging for my money back and then agreeing to seek therapy the next time I get all excited about a film that we've been waiting for for years upon years! Egads. It was almost as tragic as the Star Wars movies and I have always been a huge Star Wars fan, but after the 1st one in recent times that came out, they just got stupider from there and lost their focus of what they were all about.5. The story line sucked. That's just the honest truth about it. I mean the rope swinging almost just made me walk out of the theater and the prairie dogs didn't help. Come on Spielberg... we expect so much more out of you than contrived dribble like that.Its sad. I have never been so disgusted and let down and frustrated and just sad as I was the night we watched this movie. I am still trying to find some small redeeming factor that will make me smile about it, but have of yet been unable. That is why I give this a 2/10 and Cate, if you ever read this (which I know you won't), please don't ever stoop to this level again... you are far to gifted to play a character that is just this supremely poorly written! Think twice and fire your agent after this one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1865,jonathandevin,The Crystal Skull is a poor follow-up to a brilliant trilogy,1,25 May 2008,"I've grown up watching the Jones movies, and always thought that the great thing about them was that as far as adventure movies go, they were intelligent and truly mystifying. The strong writing and acting intensified the impact of the plot. Up till now anyway.Not only is the Crystal Skull the worst of the four, it is the worst movie I have ever seen--the only film to dislodge Zoolander from that all-time-worst position. Little to nothing worked with this film, and Harrison Ford's icon status couldn't save it from coming across as a Nationsl Treasure-like flop.First it had the problem of surpassing the brilliance of The Last Crusade which was a smash with rock-solid duel roles of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. But the Crystal Skull was totally predictable after 10 minutes. Shia LeBeouf's character, a James Dean wannabe, was so poorly written that he never had a chance to look like anything but a dork.Speaking of The Last Crusade, didn't Jones drink from the Holy Grail thus giving him eternal life? Was he ever really in danger in The Crystal Skull? The darkest point was Cate Blanchett's role as the Romulan-looking KGB mind doctor. Okay, the Temple of Doom was scary as hell, but Cate in her janitor scrubs and boots fails to cause any reaction other than an occasional chuckle. Her casting was really a mistake.The skull itself looked like it had been purchased from WalMart--completely unexpected considering that this is a Spielberg film. The digital effects were top-grade though, particularly at the end.I feel like my hero of a big brother turned out to be a bench-warmer rather than a starting quarterback. Like I just found a dead roach between layers of my chocolate cake. Like I want to sue Malco for wasting two hours of my life.Save yourselves while you can.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1866,dheim-1,This is not a serious movie - Spielberg has lost it,2,25 May 2008,"I was a huge fan of Raiders and thought it was a very serious and mysterious action movie. Most of the action scenes in Raiders were great scenes that were possible. In Crystal Skull it is an absolute joke and it does not help in the fact that the writers try to add humor(that is not really funny) into every scene where someone is getting shot at, blown-up, etc. There is a balance there and Spielberg lost it a long time ago. I would have much rather seen a more serious and educated movie(like Raiders) instead of this action-comedy movie. This movie was getting an 8.8 rating(2 days ago with decent sample size) which is extremely high for IMDb, but you can tell it is dropping fast as it is down to a 7.7 and falling. I think I am different from most of society in that movies like this and War of the Worlds are just not that good anymore and thankful that the stupid one liners are not being used in more serious movies like No Country for Old Men, Blood Diamond, etc.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1867,Zimbardo_no1,so bad,2,26 May 2008,"so after all the hype and being a big fan of all 3 Indy movies i decided to go to the cinema last night, which is rare for me i only ever usually go to the cinema to see the big summer blockbusters but god do i wish i saved my money, from the very first scene with the rubbish cgi prairie dog i sensed this was going to be a disaster. casting shia lebouf as mutt was a bad move too, i genuinely like him but he's not believable as a tough bad boy greaser or as indys sidekick and why on earth did Marian ravenwood have to brought back in? everything she did annoyed me. the story wasn't great but i went along with it, i wish i'd left then cos the ending absolutely blew any chance of me liking this film out of the water.anyway i feel better after that i just hope Spielberg has something up his sleeve after this shambles maybe directing jurassic park 4 might help but something original would be better...thundercats movie would be awesome!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1868,xboxbillsoasis,Fits into the Indy series very well.,9,26 May 2008,"Well, first off let me say that I have heard a lot of bad things about this movie....its not being treated fairly at all. People say that the plot is weak and the action is to over the top. both are not true at all!! I'll start with the plot. it takes place in the 1950's. it had to because of the age of Indy!! Ford is in his 60's and its 19 years from the last crusade. And when you think of the 1950's one of its biggest themes was aliens and area 51 so, of course thats were they were going with it! And 2nd its Lucas and Spielburg...they have made there careers off of aliens! This film was for the fans and hey, for themselves too! They love Aliens and Indy, so they mixed them...so what get over it!! and back to the action!! I have seen countless reviews....TO over the top!! no one could survive that!! No.....thats why its Indy! So, in raiders of the last ark when indy swims across the ocean with a sub that is believable....no, and it does't matter! or in temple of doom when he jumps out of a crashing airplane with a air filled raft...lands softly and slides down a mountain....oh yeah, that could happen. there are parts of every film that are unreal...thats what makes it Indy. This was not my favorite Indiana Jones but, it stills is one of my favorite movies. i would put it in third place....just above Temple of doom but before Raiders of the lost ark and the last crusade. I will buy it as soon as it comes out!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1869,evertl,Too far-fetched???!!!! Come on!!! SPOILER DEBATE!,8,25 May 2008,"Surely all who thought the film was far-fetched (especially related to the waterfall stunts and ending), should take a deep breath and remember the whole point of cinema's aim (and Mr's Lucas, Spielberg and Ford) to ENTERTAIN!!!! On the topic of stunts, yes, I do concur they're impossible to survive in reality, but we've always been forgiving in the Indy series relating to stunts. Why start criticising now?I must admit the Tarzan sequence annoyed me, but it's a small price to pay to include some entertainment for the young ones (as are the rodents, which kinda grew on me in retrospect) to appreciate.As far as the whole 'alien' debate goes, a poignant point raaised is that whereas the previous flicks were based in the late 30's and 40's, hence reflecting the Saturday serial shows which Lucas and Spielberg grew up watching, this one is ibviously set in the Atomic age of the 50's during which sci-fi had become one of the most prolific, iconic and representative genres of the time. The choice therefore to include the 'beings' is to mirror this mood of cinema at the time.The fact that the aliens were still mysterious at the end, was a great touch; no attempt was made to address the mystery, hence leaving it subtly where it belongs. The WHOLE POINT of the City of Gold, was KNOWLEDGE; hence the 'alien' motif was PERFECT since aliens are a global debate of misunderstanding and beliefs.Anyone familiar with the Indy franchise should appreciate the fact that it's never run on fact: (1) The Ark (and its powers) are debatable; (2)People continuing to live after their heart's been removed (with miraculous wound healing); (3) Eternal life after drinking from the Grail? Thumbs up all around! Now where's my hat?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1870,sunnymac55,Uncle Steven reaches out to your childhood & leaves you feeling molested.,1,26 May 2008,"Being a child of the 70's I was raised on Spielberg films, Jaws, Close Encounters, ET and the original Indiana Jones movies. For sheer bang for bucks appeal these movies gave it in spades. They had pace, they had character and they made you glad you had seen them on the big screen in the company of others who were also enjoying a director who knew how to turn out blockbusters. Today's cinema experience is a fleecing experience. After paying to park, pay for a ticket, something to eat & drink and not forgetting that nobody goes to a movie like this on their own you start to realise why you don't go so often nowadays. If there was a reason to buy into the cinema experience it was Indiana Jones 4. Well, my advice is take your hard earned cash and rent the first 3 movies & watch them at home on your own ridiculously large TV. Forget about the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, hopefully after time the memory will fade and with a little counselling you'll be able to lead a normal life. Unfortunately, Spielberg & Lucas have fallen victims to their own success. After churning out blockbusters for a decade they were able to make films without somebody saying, 'hang on... this movie sucks.' Just so it's totally clear, THIS MOVIE SUCKS.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1871,chrisglancy,One of the most upseting movie experiences ever- The death of old school live action entertainment,1,26 May 2008,"I am writing as a lifelong Indiana Jones fan. My brother and I went to our local cinema and even booked tickets online to make sure we were the first to see the film. I have to confess that when I heard they were making a new Indy movie I expressed grave reservations, I did this because Last Crusade was one of my all time favourite films which put a fitting end to three of the greatest action/ horror/ adventure movies of all time.As a kid I remember walking down the stairs one morning to find my older brother watching Radiers of the Lost Ark, I was about 8 years old and my brother about 12 (supposed target audience of the new movie). The movie had a 'dark' almost horror like theme that scared the hell out of us and made Indy unclear as a hero. Indy and his assistant ventured into a temple of booby traps and tarantulas only to betrayed by an excellent villain. I mention this because all the Indy movies had an element of real 'danger' created by feasible situations, real unanswered archaeological questions and excellent characters.The problem with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is that it totally abandons the heritage, formula and sense of impending doom that made the original films so special. As with other 80's Spielberg films like 'The Goonies' the original films had a grainy Technicolor 'vintage' feel that was great. The new ones are highly digital looking with a similarity to Star Wars Episode 1.The script is absolutely awful hamming up Indiana Jones to an imaginary new audience of unintelligent kids. I expected more from Lucas and believed the movie would have been a way to make up for the mass disappointment he caused with the recent Star Wars films. Lines are all spoken one after the other spelling out the plot and reminding you of what is happening, as would happen in a pantomime or school play. Spielberg should have done what he did with Tranformers, a movie that totally satisfied all those which had supported the franchise as kids by not hamming things up into a kiddie type film (who are now paying audience members in their 20's-30's).The worst thing about the movie as with other big movies in Hollywood is the propensity to over use CGI. The other films were 90% live action with great stunts. For example in Last crusade you have a 'real' Train fight, Tunnel of rats on fire, Speedboat chase, Castle Escape, Bike Chase, Zepplein, dog fight, Tank Fight, Tasks. This is non stop vintage and believable action that keeps you on the edge of your seat as you genuinely believe Indy is a mortal character that could bite the bullet at any point. Crystal Skull feels like a poor mans Van Helsing/ The Mummy by trying to imitate visual effects (the ants) that have been used all most ten years before in other movies.In the new one he manages to dispel the elements of nuclear physics by simply hiding in a fridge to escape a nuclear blast. I guess in the Cold War people would not have been so concerned about the Cuban Missile Crisis if they had known that people could survive the most powerful blast, not to mention radiation by hiding in a fridge.As a fan of Shia LeBouf I found him to be completely out of place in the movie, as well as hammed up as an almost unbelievable bad version of the Fonz. River Phoenix perfectly captured the mannerisms and devil may care attitude of how a Young Indiana should be in Indy III. There was an unforgivable scene with him swinging through the trees like Tarzan effortlessly with hundreds of CGI monkeys. Shia should have studied River Phoenex's masterclass of how to play a young Indy type character.Harrsion Ford is a legend, but in this film Indy is played totally different without his angry ""We are going to die!"", ""NO TICKET!"" attitude that he pulled of so brilliantly in the other films.Another thing that really annoyed me is that the film chops and changes too quickly without giving time for the characters to develop. They literally walk into a tomb, find the crystal skull and walk out again. In the others the treasure was always booby trapped.The saddest thing about this film is that it will still turnover a massive amount of revenue purely on the strength of the legendary status given to the movie by legions of movie fans who helped to build the franchise now in their 20's, 30's and 40's with kids. It however betrays this audience in favor of appealing to young unintelligent children that in reality simply don't care about Indiana Jones when they have already seen similar CGI heavy movies with poor scripts as in The Mummy, Van Helsing Tomb Radier etc.I don't want to spoil the film but the end of the movie is an absolute disgrace. I could talk about how bad this movie is and how upset I feel about it but quite frankly I don't want to waste any more of my time talking about it.So So So So So Disappointed.If you are a true fan of the original three movies there is no way you can like this new abomination of an Indiana Jones Movie.Its so upsetting because Hollywood is falling into the trap of the quick buck. But in 20 years time you will NOT be looking back at this withe the great fondness you did with the others.A true Turkey of a movie",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1872,jtperri,Excellent throwback adventure! Watch without an agenda!,9,26 May 2008,"We went to the midnight showing of the new INDIANA JONES on Wednesday. Now, I am a fan from way back (I was 12 when the first one came out) and it's hard not to have huge expectations. My wife is from an entirely different generation and went in with no agenda at all. She loved it from start to finish while I couldn't fairly judge it because I was too busy waiting for it to go south. I slept on it and then we went back the next day and saw it again. Here's the deal... RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a great film, nearly impossible to top. Interestingly enough, I thoroughly enjoyed the second movie, TEMPLE OF DOOM, just as much (I was 15 and still full of imagination at that point.) By the time THE LAST CRUSADE rolled around, I was 20 years old and much less able to see things with child-like wonder. The third film wasn't as ""magical"" to me when I saw it in theaters. Recently, I re-watched all 3 and found that I loved them all- for very different reasons. RAIDERS will always be a great adventure film- lightning in a bottle. The other 2 are great adventures. The common thread is Indy- and if you love him, you love the films... all 4 of them. The second time I saw CRYSTAL SKULL, I didn't compare it to anything that came before. After all, it's an entirely different pop culture throwback- while the first 3 are take-offs on the movie serials of the 1930s and 1940s, the new one is a representation of the sci-fi B movies of the 1950s and, as such, it works perfectly. There are certainly a couple of moments where you shake your head (Lucas' tribute to TARZAN) but then you notice that the 8-year-olds in the audience are loving those parts. Harrison Ford turns in a virtuoso performance. He has refined Indy's character to reflect all the previous experiences we have witnessed. Indy has become like his own father in many ways (wise, experienced, confident and calm) and learned from his father's failings as well (when dealing with the younger Mutt, he is understanding, attentive and ""cool."") Mutt's character is a welcome addition as is the return of Marion Ravenwood- Shia LaBoeuf and Karen Allen are both truly excellent. The supporting cast turn in solid performances as well. There are touches of humor and mystery throughout and the motorcycle chase and the grave-yard scene are on par with any of the action sequences from the first 3 films. All-in-all it was great to see old friends again and, for a little over 2 hours, to be 12-years-old again!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1873,fromgoodtta,We have been waiting for the last 19 years,5,26 May 2008,"IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL THAT DOESN'T WATCH THE MOVIE YET:If you love Indiana Jones (and with love I mean one that watched the 3 movies many times and that knows the best lines by heart)DON'T GO TO WATCH KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL!!!I'm not saying that just because of the useless waste of money for the ticket but much more because of your memories of the myth, of the hero: the kingdom of the Kristal skull will spoil these marvelous memories that made us dream for all our youth and beyond.Indiana Jones is the very reason why I love so much movies. The last Crusade was the first movie I watched in a cinema when I was 9 and it just blown my mind. I must admit that in this 4th installment Harrison Ford did a great job (for what he could do with the script he had) and that also Shia LaBeouf was good (in the beginning I thought that Indy with a son was a mistake but it turned out to be one of the few good ideas). Also some scene felt like Indy style, like the one at the warehouse or the motorbike chase and even the one with the giant ants (and no, they didn't copy from The Mummy, It's ""The Mummy"" (1999) that copy from Indiana Jones).But in the end the problem was that I waited 19 years to have more of the trilogy that I will never get tired of, more magical adventures, more ancient tricks, more funny lines and arguments, more of a hero that never has a plan but that always managed somehow and most of all, I wanted more of the whip.But in this ""sequel"" there was nearly no sign of any of it (Where in the world was the whip?!). Instead Mr. Lucas has offered us a nuclear-bomb proved fridge, a monkey-rope sequence, a fantastic cast that had to portray simplistic characters with ridiculous lines, a plot with black holes everywhere, but most of all a great ending with Aliens, and with that I don't mean that there is a simple reference to aliens, but that there are actual alive aliens, WITH AN ACTUL FLYING SAUCER!!!!!!So, Thank you George, thank you for having share with us your wonderful ideas After all WE HAVE BEEN WAITNG JUST FOR THE LAST 19 YEARS!!!!!

1874,sixmilefalls,"OK movie, but not great.",5,26 May 2008,"(((SPOILERS))) As a fan of the Indiana Jones movies, I did find this film somewhat entertaining, but it seemed that every few minutes something on screen happened that would take me out of the story.First, the stunt doubles that were used in some of the action sequences, and especially the motorcycle chase, were not a good match for Harrison Ford, or were not shot or edited well enough to sell the gags to the audience.Second, the crystal skull looked really cheap and not believable. The skull Was obviously made from clear hard acrylic. The way the actors sometimes held the skull, and when they threw it around, showed that it was very light weight. I am surprised that a skull made from smoked glass or some other heavier material was not used instead. The skull was a character in the movie with several close-ups and extreme close-ups, and it surprises me that the filmmakers would think that a clear plastic skull would play well for the audience. Maybe they planned to enhance the skull with CGI effects in post production, and ran out of time.Third, like many fans of action movies, I know how guns work. In some of the scenes in the warehouse, the bad buys were pointing Thompson machine guns at Indy that were not even cocked.Finally, the story just got unbelievable and just plain goofy a few times along the way. An atom bomb drops next to Indy and he is saved by hiding in a refrigerator. Indy and gang go over waterfalls higher than Niagra Falls three times in an amphibious vehicle. And the alien plot twist turns the movie from a period action film into a Si-Fi cartoon.This was not a bad movie, but it would have been a great movie if it were not for the goofs and whole alien thing.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1875,HoTea,Spielberg loves children,6,26 May 2008,"To the people who were disappointed by this fourth episode of Indiana Jones, let me remind you something about the new ""improved"" Spielberg : he hass clearly dedicated his ""art"" to the new generation, with a use of modern graphic treatment (the Industrial Light and Magic trade mark - see the new Star Wars episodes). Of course, the old fans will probably not appreciate this new episode for what it is, because they expect something a bit like the old ones. But take a minute and imagine how this new Indiana Jones adventure might look to the youngest generation : probably magic and cult.I don't consider myself part of the ""new spectator's generation"", not because I'm old, just because I'm a great fan of the first Indiana Jones adventures. So, like most of the fans, I was expecting something like the first three. We were clearly wrong. Spielberg mixed ""too much humour"" and ""new magic brand"" to create a all new ""Indy touch"". See the scene when Indy escapes nuclear strike by hidding in a fridge : of course it's not possible (or extremely unlikely), but Spielberg did'nt want to be realistic here : he wanted to be funny, and even ridiculous and ""too much"". The now famous ""Alien end"" is another magical and unrealistic element of the movie. For the ones who loved the first three Indiana Jones, this storyline is a big joke, but for the youngest who don't know the Indiana Jones trilogy, it will certainly be a moment they won't forget.As a conclusion, I'd say : forgive Spielberg, he loves children.Why 6/10 then ? Because even if you make a movie for children, doesn't mean you have to make bad car chase scenes with enormous mistakes (at some point, Jones' car is behind the enemy truck... few seconds later he's jumped ahead of them...)

Unless he is locked up to realise his crimes against humanity he may well start remaking Lawrence of Arabia with aliens, back to the future with aliens, the bourne identity with aliens or god forbid Indiana Jones with Aliens....err too late!!My biggest problem is that with such a great crew on board, is this really the best they could come up with?

What on earth is happening to people...So many people have actually come to accept terrible CGI as part of the cinematic experience but it doesn't have to be that way. Simply put, great acting a good story is all we need...this film has neither...and this is why I have felt so strongly and I feel too many people don't speak up.

1877,mereel_9-1,"Its the Years, Honey, not the Mileage",5,2 June 2008,"There's a phrase from where I am, I don't know if it is known in the rest of the world, it says ""Is not the same The Three Musketeers than Twenty Years After"". I think it can explain this movie very well, in all his areas.I remember when I went to see The Last crusade to the Theatre, I was about 8 years old and I can't remember other experience so wonderful like the one I have with that movie. Movies this days don't have that magic. and when I hear that a New Indiana Jones movie was planed I had as much as joy as fear that this great hero gets hit by this digital era. And I wasn't mistaken. Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull is, in general terms, a disaster. The historic errors of the Peruvian civilization and Mexican History are pathetic. I can't believe that in this era, with this powerful tool that is the Internet, and with the power Spielberg and Lucas have, that they cannot expend a few day investigating what are they trying to show. Mexican music as background for Peru? Chickens in the airport?(Which, by the way, doesn't exist an airport in Nasca).The Own Spielberg has said that he is no longer the director he was when he begins, its a real pity. Raiders, Close Encounters, ET. This are but a few examples that Spielberg Was a great director, visionary. I really expect his comeback with this movie but really is pathetic. John Williams is the master of themes for movies and the trilogy of the Dr. Jones's Adventures has the best pieces of music heard in the celluloid. Unfortunaly here has nothing new. The only pieces that makes me feel the magic is, of course, the Raider's March and the bits when can be hear the Ark's Theme and the Father and Son theme from Last crusade.The action scenes are over the top, even for a Indiana Jones Movie, and the characters has that problem Spielberg's characters have: They are Annoying. The humor is, in my opinion, forced in the plot. I really get out of the Theatre with a bad taste in me.

The starting was over-the-top and so was the finale, in a bad way. I felt betrayed and my intelligence insulted with what Lucas came up with, he should be just retire with his vast bank account and do us all a favor and never make another movie ever again.This movie should be lost and stricken from the history books. Lucas and Spielberg have effectively killed the Indiana Jones franchise by adding poor lines, cheesy action and a horrible, laughable plot.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1879,earncorp,"A fun popcorn film, but more of a parody.",6,26 May 2008,"First of all, this film is going to make longtime Indy fans very upset. So, if you have not seen this movie, keep your expectations very, very low. So here goes.The good: A lot more fun, but not better than Last Crusade. More ancient temples, underground catacombs and classic Indy action. The dialogue between Indy and Mutt was great. Shia's performance was excellent.Classic Indy style situations.Great jungle chase scene. I actually liked the monkey scene.The bad: Some scenes just seemed very out of place like the abandoned test town, the very first shot with the groundhog, the wedding,Indy's interrogation by government agents. These scenes have Phantom Menace written all over them. The music was hardly noticeable, and possibly lifted from earlier films.The ugly. Aliens in an Indy film? Absolutely terrible.Indy surviving a nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge.A variety of other over the top action sequences. The best thing about Raiders was that the action was believable.Unlike the original trilogy, this movie did not have a good flow that built to a powerful ending. It just seemed like they pieced together a bunch of scenes. The movie had very little tension or challenging situations.Overall, a basic popcorn flick that seemed like a parody of the original trilogy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1880,natbuddy4,Thoughts on new indy,4,26 May 2008,"Overall, this movie was a let down. i was expecting it to be amazing and it was pretty terrible. SHIA LABEOUF WAS AMAZINGLY HOT in this. but my favorite of the four is still raiders. Harrison Ford was not looking as old as i expected him to look. At the beginning= movie was slow and boring. didn't get me excited middle- pretty good. Shia is a very talented actor. monkey part was a little weird tho. ending= weird and disturbing(not the word I'm looking for but whatever. What was with the weird alien stuff?? I am still glad that they decided to make a fourth installment. It was entertaining for many people, even though they may not have liked the movie as a whole. I still love Harrison ford- amazing actor. Shia Labeouf said on Jimmy Kimmel that after reading sites like IMDb, he thinks everyone hates him. EVERYONE LOVES HIM.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1881,pussbut,not worth the money,3,26 May 2008,"If I had gone to see this movie without my friends, (I didn't drive) I would have left the show after watching Indy survive a bomb blast in a 1950s era 'fridge, get thrown a mile or more, bounce several times (which the 'fridge survived, the door didn't even pop open) get out, stretch and walk away. C'mon, I know this series goes over the top, but that was so stupid even the two kids with us said it was dumb, and that scene started the movie. From there it got even more lame. Sorry, I loved the original movies, even though they were pretty campy and Indy had supernatural powers of survival. But the beatings he endures, the amount of gunfire directed at him and the idea that you can survive not one, but three waterfalls, in a boat laced with bullet holes and walk away? and on and on and on. and Aliens?? Couldn't it have been a city of gold that a German general needed to restart the Nazi machine? I cannot recommend it! When an 8 year old BOY says it was stupid and his 13 year old brother agrees Indy is in trouble. Production and acting were fine, but plot was weak and Hollywood really needs to send its writers to school on the laws of physics. Don't get me started on the stupid ants, which didn't move the story along at all, or the car chase through a jungle, ever been to a jungle? you cannot drive through them. And why was the Harley toted along to the jungle never to be seen. Again, it didn't move the plot along, why include it in the airplane scenes, DID Harley Davidson pay to have it in a certain number of scenes? I know, ITs a movie, but even movies in the Indy world need to be at least a little believable. He didn't even figure anything out, he just solved a riddle and depended on another person to have done all the work.

1882,budgie_kangaroo,Good Entertainment,8,28 May 2008,"I enjoyed this movie for solid entertainment but have to say at the outset that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" remains my personal favourite of the four. I thought Harrison Ford has stood up well to the test of time as Indiana Jones and Cate Blanchett played her part with gusto. I really liked the Russian accent in an amusing sort of way.I don't think having the story set in the fifties and not the thirties detracted from the film. The fifties are sufficiently far removed from the present to make things interesting seen from a 2008 perspective. Also Harrison Ford has aged twenty years from the last Indiana Jones film , so seeing him now in the nineteen fifties makes the film more plausible.Steven Spielberg has often been reported as saying the Indiana Jones films were influenced by the movie serial adventures of his childhood , but never referred specifically to any particular one. The 1948 adventure serial ""Congo Bill"" could well have been the spark that set Spielberg onto his Indiana Jones action masterpieces and is one of my all time favourite films. You will be giving yourself a big treat if you check ""Congo Bill"" out!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1883,onaraighl,Egregious,1,27 May 2008,"This is a terrible, dull, pretentious film. Were the Indiana Jones films always this bad? Perhaps they were, and it was only our childhood naivety that made them exciting.The script is so unbelievably wooden. How did Lucas manage to make his squillions? At the start, when the bad guys requisition the ""alien"", Indy says ""Russians"", leaving us in no doubt that the bad guys with funny accents and clownish behaviour are, err, Russian.The plot is absurd (in a bad way). Aliens and communists? Maybe this was a good premise for a comic book in the 1950s, but now it is just ridiculous. And the ridicule is heightened, not diminished, by the special effects.I guess the Indy franchise was always about cultural imperialism, and I never noticed; I just laughed at the blonde eating the monkeys' brains. Now it really shows. The ""primitive"" people are savages that blow poison darts at the handsome white heroes. And again, the alien plot depends on the idea that ancient south Americans developed agriculture and irrigation with the help of aliens. Because of course, it would be impossible for any non-white civilization to do this unaided.The movie itself and the characterization are so awfully stereotyped and predictable. I'm not spoiling much by saying that the corrupt spy with his thirst for gold dies in an extraordinarily superficially ironic way. (Incidently, this character's most important purpose in the film is to appear every now and then and say ""Jonesey"" in a ""cute"" British accent.) This film is possibly worse than Pearl Harbour. I don't know. Suffice to say, the Russian communists who complain about their negative portrayal in this film have little to worry about. This is an egregious shocker.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1884,artfulend,What a shame,4,27 May 2008,"How could they do this to my all time hero!!! You have to wonder how the big names involved could make such a bad movie, perhaps with the exception of Mr Lucas, who's been there before with a certain 'other trilogy', and seems to make a habit of it these days. Did they actually go back and watch the originals before starting this? In a nutshell, the filmmakers seemed more interested in stringing together a series of action sequences without questioning their relevance to the story. Many people criticised the slower sections, but I actually think more of this was required to add gravitas to the mix; to provide the cement without which the wall falls down...and yes, the wall most definitely fell down. Furthermore, while suspending reality was always a requirement with the original films (how did Indy ever get inside that Nazi submarine...it's left to the viewer's imagination) this seems to have been exaggerated out of all proportions (the fridge, the Tarzan moves, the truck landing on the tree, the three waterfalls). Gone is the grittiness (as someone else said 'the balls'), the emotion, the sheer grunt that keeps the originals alive. In summary, this is less of a 'movie' and more of a 'themed roller-coaster'. It's worthy of a smile or laugh, but won't make you rush out to see it again or buy the DVD; it left me feeling cold and uninvolved. Needless to say, I'll be wearing my Indy hat at half mast.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

After the circus that was Star Wars Episodes I-III, I don't know how I could have had high expectations for this.But, somehow, I did.And I am defeated.In my mind, I see Harrison Ford sitting on that ridiculous flying refrigerator in front of a blue screen, Lucas yapping in his nasal in the background, Spielberg thinking, ""Dear God, what have I gotten myself into?"", Cate Blanchett crying softly in the dressing room as Shia LeBeouf smugly attempts to take her out for drinks after a day of filming.And I am bereaved.They could have played it safe. They could have just whipped up a little homage to the first three movies instead of trying to outdo them and instead falling on their faces. They shove the body of the first three films neck-to-neck into the last hour and a half, but they forget the soul.I just can't come to grips with this. When you're in a theater, and people are laughing AT the movie and not with it, you know something has gone wrong. You know you have been dealt a blow when your beloved archaeologist has become a laughingstock.Oh Indy...People worried Ford would be too old. In the end, it is Lucas (who has clearly gone absolutely bonkers) and Spielberg who are too old, a phenomenon clearly unrelated to age.Where is John Rhys-Davies? Where is Denholm Elliott? This is no homage. It is merely a mockery, a parody.It is not a ""bad"" film, but neither is it a good one--it makes even National Treasure look decent, and considering expectations, it is a dire punch to the breadbasket, calling into question not just loopy Lucas but Hollywood in its entirety, which I fear died long ago, and its rotting carcass now howls at us from the grave. Someone drive a stake through the heart of this undead beast! Spare us the agony. My ears bleed, and it makes nocturnal rises from the grave to eat the brains of our children.How can this happen in a benevolent universe?

1889,corcutt007-1,Dear George & Steven...What were you thinking?,4,27 May 2008,"Dear George & Steven:What Were You Thinking?My first experience with a ""blockbuster"" movie was Raiders of the Lost Ark, the original Indiana Jones movie. I was exactly 11 years old, and it was my first time waiting on a really long line by myself to see a film. I saw the film at the now defunct Dutchess Mall, and I remember saying to myself as the line inched forward, ""This better be good.""It was.Since then, I've watched it, beginning to end, at least 150 times. This past weekend, I went to see the new Indiana Jones movie, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, hoping it would be good.It wasn't.Like Temple of Doom, this was another Indy movie that shouldn't have been made.Initially, in the post-FX haze that accompanies such movies, I found myself defending the film, saying that while it wasn't this or that, it was entertaining. It was entertaining. But unfortunately, Lucas and Spielberg set the bar so high with films 1 & 3 that merely entertaining isn't good enough. Sh-t, Shoot 'Em Up was entertaining; but it still sucked.Once the adrenaline rush wore off, however, I woke up yesterday morning wishing they hadn't made the film and knowing exactly why I hadn't liked it. Without spoiling the plot for you, I'd like to tell you exactly why Crystal Skull was bad and how it could have been better:* The stakes were never high enough. In fact, it wasn't clear at all why the crystal skull was so important. What was needed was another short scene with Cate Blanchett's character in the U.S.S.R., conferring with Stalin on her experiments. Maybe show her engaging in a mind- reading/mind-control experiment and then explaining to Stalin what she could do with the crystal skull, and how they had to capture Indiana Jones (one of the world's experts) to find it. The bottom line is, I needed to be worried that the Soviets might actually capture the thing, and I never was. (By contrast, in Raiders it's literally a tug-of-war to the very end as to who will get the Ark.)* The entire father-son and Indy-Marian subplot was hokey and contrived. More importantly, these things lowered Indiana Jones's lone wolf status, making him like every other American guy. Great. Now my last image of Jones is going to be him married to Marion and playing Daddy, not battling Nazis.* There is a total lack of inevitability in the scenes in Crystal Skull. When you watch Raiders closely, one thing you see is the Aristotelean concept of inevitability in plot. Character Action A inevitably, inexorably leads to or causes Event B. In this new film, what you have instead are a pastiche of scenes that seem to have been created around set devices, traps, gimmicks and suchnot because the previous scenes made them inevitable. Another film I felt this way about was the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie.* The digital effects. I'm sorry, folks, but in what is supposed to be a live-action film, I can tell the difference. Digital effects are great with animated films like Bee Movie and the like. But in films that center around an action-based character getting himself in and out of jams, the digital stuff only draws attention to itself, jarring people like me out of the film. When you watch Raiders closely, you'll see there are only 2 shots in the entire film that look slightly fakethe Jeep-off-the-cliff shot and the melting-faces shot. But because everything else up to that point has been real, the eye forgives them.A scene in Raiders where you see the virtues of live-action over digital effects is in the wide shot of the great dig at Tannis. Those guys wielding pickaxes in the background are flesh- and-blood people, not digitally rendered quasi-humans, cut and pasted 10,000 times into the frame and mindlessly performing the same actions. Each of those extras in Raiders brought a tiny bit of individualism to his little character; I can imagine that each of them invented a tiny backstory for their characters, explaining why they swung their pickaxes a certain way or shoveled out dirt. The result is a beautiful shot that looks real.Finally, the main thing I don't understand is why Lucas and Spielberg felt compelled to make Crystal Skull at all. There's nothing particularly unique about the plot, and the legion of writers they went through to come up with a decent script shows in the final product, which is little more than two hours of interesting, humorous stunts. All I can say is, thank God they made Raiders. That film is a masterpiece and will, in my opinion, go down as one of the best movies ever made.http://www.orcutt.net/weblog",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1891,kinderbrause,Still in tears .... and not the good kind,1,27 May 2008,"I love the Indy Trilogy, watched it a dozen times and couldn't wait for this one. I tried not to be spoiled, didn't read the reviews or watched the trailers, so that I would be able to form my own opinion on this movie. I even tried not to expect too much. The only expectation I had, was that it had to be less disappointing than Episode 1. But my disappointment concerning movies hit a new low. I really really tried to like it, but they made it impossible to. I thought setting the new movie into the 50s was actually a good idea. I could relate to Nevada, Area 51, even the Roswell aliens. I could even overlook Indy surviving a nuclear blast in a fridge - ridiculous as it was.But why was it not possible to let Indy search for a Crystal Skull, that may or may not be of alien nature, being chased by the Russians, only to find it at the end of the movie and the Skull being destroyed or locked away in Area 51? That would have been a plot in the sense of the first movies. But my wildest imaginations couldn't prepare me for Aliens and flying saucers in a Indy movie. That's as if God had appeared and congratulated Indy for finding his lost Ark at the end of Raiders.But it wasn't only the ridiculous plot. I remember reading an Interview where Spielberg and Lucas stated they tried to work with stunt teams and would only use CGI if there wasn't any other way. But that doesn't justify computer animated gophers, that you expect to start talking any minute or Ted-look-alike monkeys. Or a car chase that would have made the Wachowski brothers proud. The set of the Maya City with the fading stairs seemed like the leftovers of ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" and the ants like a cheap rip off from ""The Mummy"".Humour was created through nostalgic in-jokes but it lacked the original wit that excelled the first three parts. Unbearable over-the-top CGI action sequences were extended to a length that there wasn't any time left to pay tribute to the characters, their relationships or even dialog lasting longer than three sentences.And did I really need to know that Indy is actually the father of Tarzan? That he is not only a Doctor/Professor and an adventurer but a Colonel, an agent and a Double-Agent as well? That Marian has grown so tough that she borders on insanity with her hysterical laughter whenever danger is ahead?It's just a loud CGI-action movie without the heart and soul from the former Indy movies. Even a sense of adventure is missing.But at least Indy seems to have retired. Let’s just hope that Lucas and Spielberg won’t reunite again for Henry Jones Junior III – the new Trilogy.

As entertaining as Indy 4 was in parts, I felt the story was not up to Steven's best efforts. As I watched the film, I found myself seeing bits and pieces from other movies such as, The Mummy, National Treasure, and maybe a little Back to the Future. Its as though his writers sold out to the studio executives who pieced together parts of other successful films to make this one. Please....stop listening to those execs...they are not the creative force that make movies Great!!! Just cheaper to produce and often times less appealing to the audience.Lets be honest. The reason the first 3 Indy films were successful was that they were creative and created memorable characters we could all get behind. Some may not like the 2nd due to the graphic heart pulling events (pardon the pun) but it was unique. I hope Steven will go back and bring us one more Indy movie that is fresh, unique and interesting.

1893,NukingTheFridge,"Good, but lacking fridge.",4,27 May 2008,"I give this movie a solid ""4"" of 10 for entertainment value, because it was nice to see my good friend Harry Ford back on the screen and the film reeked of the magic of George and Steven Spielberg. Yet... I can't help but feel it was lacking one vital ingredient: fridge!Early on in production I heard about the Doomtown sequence and I got all excited. I imagined a film comprised of fridge interludes and perhaps a couple mine chases involving fridges as well. Remember classic Indy Jones film ""Temple of Doom,"" in which Short Round and Willie run from the bad guys on the mines in the temple of doom? I wanted more of that, but with fridge.Granted, there is one really good fridge sequence early on in the film. John Williams described it as the ultimate scene of the fridge genre, and I agree with him. Indy Jones clears out a freezer and plops himself inside to blast off for a nuclear explosion. Prairie dogs also make a cameo appearance which I found cute and appealing and reminded me of Drew Barrymore in ""E.T."" which makes me laugh for nostalgia. But the fridge came and left and wasn't given much room to expand as a character. I think George should have stopped liposuctioning the growth on his neck and spent more time developing the fridge as a main character. The dirt bike chase with Shia and Harry Ford on the campus in Michigan was boring. Imagine how more exciting it would have been if they had been driving a fridge with wheels? And Harry Ford could have made a loving reference to his late father and then Shia could have said, ""Whatever you do, don't pop the trunk!"" And then we could have cut to a classic Indy Jones facial reaction as he realizes what the truth is, and reaches down and opens the fridge and out pops the great Sir Sean Connery in a fridge cameo. He could have said, ""Junior?!"" and then died. And that would have solved the case of the missing Connery which was a BIG distraction for me here, because he came and left with Marcus Brody from ""JAWS"" without any real explanation. Harry Ford saying ""I miss dad"" isn't the same as having dad trapped in a fridge on wheels, now, is it?For me, the good things are:Prairie dogs - CGI - Fridge explosion - Fridge radiation - Cate Blanchett's Beatles haircut - John Hurt talking about the gibberishBut the negatives were:My good pal Harry Ford (he's too old isn't he?) - Not enough fridge - No Sean Connery in a fridge on wheels in summer time with Mark Brody - No Richard Dreyfuss ""JAWS"" cameo (take advantage of him before he dies Steven!)This was overall a solid ""4"" of 10 but definitely not a 5 or 7 grade!Maybe the next film will have more fridge for us to enjoy.

In the first couple of minutes of the movie we see russians. We hear russians. It is so obvious that these people are russians. They even speak like those russians we all know from seeing James Bond or any cold-war movie.But still Indiana Jones first line of the movie is ""Russians!"", just to make sure that even the dumb kid sitting in the back row gets it.It gets worse. Five minutes later, about ten minutes in, Indy escapes from the warehouse where ""top men"" are ""investigating"" the ark seen from the first movie.We all know when first entering the warehouse (cue John Williams ark-score) that the ark is stored inside somewhere, so is it REALLY necessary to remind us by showing an open crate with the ark clearly visible inside? Heard of subtlety? To be fair the first 25 minutes or so of this movie is decent. But then it's all downhill from there. From the scene where they get to Peru accompanied by Mexican music (!), the story drags on and on. All the excitement one could expect is simply not there.

1896,mcpuma80,An Epic Failure,2,27 May 2008,"I am a huge Indiana Jones fan, like most reviewers here. I grew up watching the first 3 movies and rank The Last Crusade as my all-time favorite movie. When I heard the rumors that this movie was in production as far back as 5 years ago, I just shook my head. When I finally saw it coming this year, I contemplated not seeing it out of respect to the other movies (of course, curiosity will always get the better of me). If there was a sacred cow that shouldn't have been touched, it was this franchise.Nonetheless, I ended up seeing it this weekend. I put my cynical biases aside and was legitimately excited to see it. If Live Free or Die Hard was entertaining, and Revenge of the Sith was entertaining, why not this? Well...I'll tell you why this is the 2nd worst movie I've ever seen in my life.1. Harrison Ford is old.Yes, it happens. Actors age. Unfortunately, seeing Ford painfully deliver his Indy lines with a slight slur was like watching a favorite relative get Alzheimer's. He IS NOT the same actor. He is especially not young enough to play this character. This should have been Reason #1 for Lucas and Spielberg NOT to make this movie. Get ready for Blade Runner 2 movie fans...2. The Plot was embarrassing.Aliens? Wow, so you mean to tell me Lucas and Spielberg sat there and wrote up the plot, consisting of such gems as a flying saucer coming out of the ground and an alien frying Kate Blanchett's brains? And they actually thought, ""Wow, what a great idea!""? And Harrison Ford read this script and was OK with this? An unbelievable failure on all levels.That's just the main plot. Nevermind scenes like Shia Lebouf swinging around the jungle with monkeys, like Tarzan. Or throwing in scenes like Shia fencing while doing a split between 2 fast moving vehicles (John Woo style). And let's not forget the cherry on top...Indy jumping into a Fridge and being blown miles(?) away by a nuclear bomb, yet somehow surviving the violent explosion/subsequent crash and extreme radiation. If I was with people, I would have walked out of the movie at that point. And that was only 20 minutes in!! 3. Karen Allen is insane.She nearly died from an extreme drug problem and it shows in this film. She wears a psychotic grin on her face the entire movie. The scene where they go over the cliff in the rapids and end up on shore was telling. Indy finds her holding the wheel of the vehicle they were in still smiling, pretending to drive. Sadly, I think Allen thought she still was driving. Dragging her into this movie was a catastrophe, dragging her character back into this story taints Raiders of the Lost Ark's story. You figure Lucas would have learned his lesson from messing with the original Star Wars, but apparently not.4. This movie never should have been made.Much like Rambo, Live Free or Die Hard, Rocky 6, Jurassic Park 3, The Phantom Menace, etc, film makers just don't know when to leave well enough alone. You cannot ever improve upon The Last Crusade. You can't ever top Return of the Jedi. Rocky 5 was a bomb. Why would Rocky 6 be any better YEARS later? Sadly, I would not be surprised to see Indy 5 next year with Shia as the lead character.

George Lucas has once again ruined a perfectly good film by using too much CGI to hide a terrible script. I believe some great scripts were put forward (one by the shaw-shank redemption script writer) which George vetoed in favour of one which is just so poor it leaves you feeling so dissatisfied at the end i was in disbelief. Indiana Jones in not about Aliens! Why George, Why?... i think its time to retire.On a serious note, Harrison ford does a fairly decent job but his age was showing in the stunt scenes.

Too many of the effects were borrowed from other franchises and the script rated barely worth the paperwork.It's not so much an Indiana Jones movie and to be honest if Lucas and Spielberg had created a new set of characters, it would have worked better than trying to add this to the splendid original trilogy.Am I being cynical or was the inclusion of Mutt/ Junior purely a precursor for spin offs.Personally I couldn't work out if it was Lara Croft in a Mummy film playing Indiana Jones or Rick O'Connell in a Tomb Raider film playing Indiana Jones.One has to wonder which franchise Lucas and or Spielberg will resurrect next.

You cannot watch this movie and suspend disbelief. It isn't good enough for you to forget you're watching a movie.The teenage character is hokey and ridiculous. The opening ""situation"" shown in the movie is hokey and ridiculous.Jones movies were always cheezy, but that isn't what Im talking about. I knew I was buying ""cheezy"". This is just plain BAD.This film is not even worth renting.

1900,josh-1191,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Impossible Special Effects,3,28 May 2008,"Compared to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, King Kong is believable and Meet the Spartans would be considered a serious movie.Naturally, for a movie which stars Harrison Ford, is co-written by George Lucas and is directed Steven Spielberg, you would expect a really good film to continue the Indiana Jones legacy. What you get though is ET meets Star Wars with a dash of archaeology thrown in.This film actually comes close to Armageddon's record for most impossible scenes in one film. What with the ridiculous man eating ants, Indy escaping from the epicentre of a nuclear blast in a lead fridge, the sword fight on two moving cars, and five people not only surviving three huge waterfalls, but staying in the same boat for two of them! Wait there's more, the crystal skull is magnetic and yet it attracts gold. Also the magnetic force only attracts objects when there is some tense cinematic reason for doing so Not only that, but for some super, all knowing, inter-dimensional, powerful alien/s, they sure were astronomically stupid to let some mere mortal go and nick their precious skull.And please, for the love of all thats good and real, don't even attempt to give me a reason why Dr Jones, Jr. doesn't get sucked into the vortex that would have been created when the flying saucer takes off, or why the physical force of the Amazon river rushing into the hole that is subsequently created doesn't cause Indy and Co to go on one big cliff-slide into the water below.When there are so many physical impossibilities in a movie the plot really does need to be amazing to rescue the film. Unfortunately this is not the case for this one, the plot is lame, and everybody with a brain bigger than a peanut would guess the many predictable twists. Also, for a series of films where the villain is always destroyed at the end of the film by the artifact that they were trying to get, you could have at least let Indy get the bad guy (girl) in the end for a change.To sum up, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull does nothing to deserve the title of a 'good' film and it was a complete waste of time to go and watch it. Average acting, a predictable script and impossible, over the top special effects completely spoil this movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1901,eamonnc81,Truly disappointing,5,28 May 2008,"I recently read in a newspaper review that any nostalgic child from the 80's will love this film,this comment could not be more far from the truth. I grew up loving the Indy movies but i felt this time out it lacked what its predecessors had in abundance, adventure. It's not that this Indy film is bad it is just that hype can sometimes disappoint you.I would have thought that when you have a nineteen year gap since Indy was last on the big screen, this would have been plenty of time to construct the ultimate tribute to this character.Unforutunately i felt Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Lucas decided to cash in on the world's most famous archaeologist. Ford is at his usual best and despite his age he still holds up well.But Ford's best efforts can not undo the weak storyline. A brief glimpse of some of the older characters and plots is welcome, but all in all while watching this movie i felt that it was aimed towards todays child and not the legions of Indy fans around the world(most likely for merchandising reasons).

1906,starfoxii,Not just a bad Indiana Jones movie... just a bad movie in its own right,1,28 May 2008,"***Spoiler alert, whole comment*** OK, so I just finished watching this movie at the theater and have been trying to figure out exactly what bothered me about it since I got home. After mulling it over, I think I figured it out. At first I thought it was the pointless nuked fridge scene, or the pointless cgi groundhogs, or the pointless cgi monkeys that attack the ""bad guys"" for no apparent reason at all, or the pointless and ludicrous ""car gently landing on tree over cliff"" scene. Then I realized that while all of those bothered me, and I mean really bothered me, that the fundamental problem was much worse. The movie had a plot that was also, essentially, pointless.The whole time, the crystal skull artifact is kept away from the Russians so that Indiana Jones and his posse can return it to the crystal skeleton body that it originally came from. The problem is that this is also exactly what the Russians want to do, and while Indy himself has no real motivation to stop them decides to jump into the conflict anyway. Sure, he might be slightly concerned over the Rocky and Bullwinkel style Natasha's plan to use the skull for psychic warfare, but it seems unlikely; this plot element is further ignored later when the female Commie totally abandons this original plan and instead seeks intellectual godhood. So basically at the end of the movie Jones could've helped to find the city and return the skull with minimal to no risk, restored his friend's mental health, rescued his old lover and ultimately annihilate the Russian baddies. And to make matters worse, if he decided not to get involved at all and instead went to hang out on the beach, the results would have been EXACTLY THE SAME. His friend would've regained his sanity, his old lover escaped, and the Russians would still die. Sure, it might've taken a little longer without the help of Dr. Jones but it would've happened eventually; and if it didn't, then everything still would turn out OK right? In Raiders the Ark had to be recovered to save the world and bring back a precious artifact, in Temple a village had to be saved from starvation and sacrifice and in Crusade Indy had to stop an evil man from becoming immortal and eventually save his father's life with that same artifact. What was the driving force motivating him this time around then? Curiosity? Apparently, when that question is asked in the movie, Indy replies ""because the skull told me to return it"". Are you kidding? 9 tenths of the movie is over, the characters have finally escaped and this is what is supposed to pull the plot together and further the action? Curiosity and an adventurous spirit would've been a better device, and that would have been weak enough. It is an example of really, really bad writing.Short and sweet, the movie suffers from bad writing both on a scene to scene level but on the overarching story level as well. Indiana Jones has no business messing with aliens, it just feels wrong and like Spielberg and Lucas were once again satisfying an alien fetish. Ludicrous CGI stunts were not only put in without developing characters or the story at all, but they weren't even done well. As a movie in its own right this film is awful. As an Indiana Jones film, this movie is unforgivable.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1907,peterbarrett250,An Indy Too Far,3,29 May 2008,"A new Indiana Jones film is just the thing to while away a couple of hours on a wet weekend afternoon  pure mindless entertainment, enjoyed with a bucket of popcorn and forgotten the minute its over.Well they certainly managed the mindless alright, but the entertainment is less in evidence. There was scarcely a peep from the audience throughout: no laughter, no squeals of excitement, no involuntary jumps. I've noticed a similar reaction to many sequels to things like Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Matrix, Shrek. People enjoy the originals and, however turgid and bloated the follow-ups become, continue to pack the cinemas, presumably looking to recapture the magic of the originals.The dead hand of George Lucas, who wrote the 'story', is particularly in evidence here: a powerful object must be protected from the evil ones and returned to its rightful pace underground, two characters turn out to be father and son, a spaceship takes off at the end taking the aliens back from whence they came  honestly, George, where do you get your ideas from? Of course there's plenty of chases and stunt work, but CGI sucks the danger and excitement out of the whole enterprise  we may as well be watching a cartoon. The dialogue clunks throughout  you can almost feel the audience anticipating a funny line, but nothing comes. The plot is both overly complex and stupid. In these sequels the general rule is: the worse the plot, the longer the cast spend explaining it to each other.There's an array of acting talent here but the cast are given nothing interesting to do. Ray Winstone  is he a double agent, a treble agent? Anybody care? Harrison Ford dials in his performance, his mind obviously on some half-finished table. Cate Blanchett does the job is a modern day Rosa Klebb with a silly haircut but are we really supposed to be scared of this woman and her commie cannon fodder? Shia LaBeouf enters as The Wild One but is soon transformed into The Dull One.Of course Steven Spielberg must take his share of the blame. He is a great director but if he has an Achilles heel it is his attempts at humour; Exhibit A: 1941 Exhibit B: Always Exhibit C: The Terminal. The prosecution rests. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is attempting to be tongue-in-cheek. So its not serious, but then neither is it funny. So it ends up being pretty much nothing at all.All of course ends happily and Indy can go back to the real love his life: woodwork. Oh sorry, I mean Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) - full marks for at least including a heroine with wrinkles though. If you've got this far and want a laugh, just look at the rictus grin on Harrison Ford's face. Extensive CGI would have been required to make this look genuine, or maybe Spielberg could have waved a pay check from behind the camera.It takes as much skill to produce mindless entertainment as it does to produce the winner of the Palm D'Or in Cannes, but there's precious little skill on show here.Pete Barrett www.whositof.com",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Now spend half the movie budget on marketing rather than the movie itself and you have a winner.Franchise films have moved on into true franchises now, just crank out the same old tasteless yet familiar paste, and the drones flock in. The McIndy has a new flavor, hurry in!The movies won't get better until everyone stops paying money to go to see the bad ones, especially sequels you know are going to suck.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1909,wiegerp,"George Orwell was right, ignorance is strength.",10,29 May 2008,"i am amazed, how many people can think that this movie is one of the best ever. I am horrified by the ignorance that you have to the rest of the world. I can agree that an Indiana Movie is and contains magical realism, that's why it's called fiction. I can agree on a fake skull. Do you really find it interesting about Aliens, skulls, even Peru. Please, you think that is great, imagine how we think about your constant wars to ""biochemical weaponry"" imagine how we feel about your magical realism of a perfect country. Do you think Peruvians have a international flight from Nazca (who by American Stupidity is located somewhere in Cuzco). Please, that really show's the same stupid reason you decide to invade a country. That's the same reason why their is so much disagreement about ethnic groups to you. It is because they can outstand the ignorance created by the American's. I cannot believe how you can handle to have the best universities of the world when at the end (the most developed country) produces a movie in which they think that everybody speaks in Qechua. I'm sorry but George Orwell is right. Your ignorance is strengh. Your lack of international conscience is absolutely amazing. You speak about changing the world, by establishing an open economy when Americans cannot even dare to sign a greenhouse agreement. Do you think that it is better to look for biochemical weapons? spend 47 billion dollars. I believe American Government is wrong. The best and most effective weapon is ignorance. You talk about the greatness of the united nations? did you actually know that it follows the same pattern of the league of nations in the following years of WW1. However, being myself a educated man i risk to say that this movie is absolutely American Comedy. It is an americanist ignorance and just for your lack of information, i would like to establish some facts: 1. Peru has Peruvian music, please don't dare put Mexican Music, we think it's good but next time try to introduce Marinera will you? 2. I am Peruvian, i don't speak Quechua (native language) and i know English far better than many of you can and would ever understand. 3. Peru Nazca Lines are in the Coast, no in the sierra (which is the andean part, like the alps) yeah. Do you see big alps near Nazca Lines? no, i think not. 4. Peru has a magical culture, yes, there are theories about aliens, but these are theories. Don't ever think of agreeing to them. We have recently adopted Machupichu as one of the world's wonders. Please do not downfall the prestige they have given us. Would you actually think that the conference of the Al-cue could happen in Peru if we only spoke Quechua? 5. To finish my argument, if you are planning to film something in the jungle do not include the sounds of many native birds in India will you? we have our own sounds and the own animals, this has really made the film boring. Anyway, i cannot bare American Ignorance to the world, just answer this question before you leave, how many of the United States people know where Irak is? how many people know why the 2nd World War started. Please do not tell me it was Pearl Harbour. Thank you very much, ladies and gentleman.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

A true disappointment. A terrible script, one unbelievable escape after another, inaccurate characters, child-like performances (save Cate Blanchett & Shia LaBeouf), & painful one-liners. This movie was NOT made for the fans as Spielberg had said. Rather, it was made for the stars of the movie. A Hollywood high school reunion. The only good thing about going to see this movie was the fantastic parking spot I found. Which makes me wonder...

Sadly I was proved right.Good effort Harrison Ford, and cast, shame about the shockingly self-indulgent plot line.

I loved it for a variety of reasons. #1 Spielberg let the main characters in the film be (and look)their age with grace and humour, and without apologizing for it. #2 Harrison, although taking awhile, really got into his stride in the film. I love the number of stunts that you can tell he has done himself, and the fun he allows poked at himself and his character. You can tell he is having the time of his life, and it is infectious! #3 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY The entire film is a wonderful homage to the fifties, from the settings, the topics, the pitfalls and the lighting, Spielberg has created a wonderful parody of everything fifties. Just as the first Indy was a nod to the serials of the forties, this movie is wonderfully crafted around the following decade. I went back to see the film a second time just to concentrate on that aspect of the movie. Is this Indy as good as the original? How could it possibly be? Is it a good movie on its own merit, though?

1914,tykeoni,Great but does lack some,9,30 May 2008,"For a while now i have been listening to people complain on how Indiana Jones 4 sucked. Now i am not trying to be rude and rag on others opinions but frankly this movie was great. the thing is a lot of people don't like it just because of its sci-fi quality and i find that a bad basis to judge the movie. This is just a small change in the Indiana Jones adventure and i find it a good one. if the fans of the previous Jones movies have noticed, all of them revolve around religious symbols. With this new movie based on an other worldly object on not a religious artifact, it prevents the Jones series from being too repetitive and for that i applaud it. Another weird reason people seem to be ragging on the movie, which i find unnecessary, is the fact of the ""excess"" use of CGI. I never really noticed the over use of CGI and the only moments i can remember seeing CGI was during the monkey swinging and the killer swarm of ants. other than that i saw no problems. i, funny enough, was too busy watching the movie to even take notice of apparent ""excessive"" use of CGI. all i have to say is people like this should have just tried to enjoy the movie instead of trying to find fault in its excessive visual quality. And the last part of my criticism of the criticizers is the fact of people not liking the movie because of the introduction of aliens into the movie. this addition to me is completely reasonable, you just have to think about it. First off the movie takes place in the 1950s. In other words, during the time of the Roswell aliens conspiracy and the beginning of the alien visitor craze. the 1950s was a time of the supernatural and the fear of nuclear weapons (new unknown technology). this was a perfect theme for this time. Also, if you never heard of this before, there have been tons of speculation that the crystal skulls found in South America (yes they do exist; some are fake but a few are real) cannot be made by humans. with the skulls containing certain light tunnels that make the eyes, mouth and nose glow in the light and the fact its so smooth not even machines of today can make it many people think that aliens made these skulls and left them behind after there visit to earth. this may seem weird but it is a real speculation. Because of these facts from the present and the past it gives good reason of why this movie is based on crystal skulls and aliens. Now people have a right to there opinions. all i am trying to do is give others a chance to understand the certain things that made them think the movie sucked. the movie was great and i honestly think that if you liked the first three you will like this one. its full of adventure, humor and drama. it gives a new edge to the Jones universe and i liked it. i hope those that watched to movie enjoyed it and for those who didn't, well i hope this changes your mind.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1915,joseph-greer,I LOVE Indy!!! I HATE this movie!!!,2,31 May 2008,"If you're a true Indy fan, pass on this film and keep the dream alive.The beauty of almost any Spielberg-directed film lies in the story. E.T., The Color Purple, Saving Private Ryan, Close Encounters, Empire of the Sun, and Schindler's List are examples of riveting original stories that held your attention in a vice grip. Not so with this film. If I could give it a theme, it would be ""You gotta be kidding me!"".Spielberg and Lucas should be ashamed of this film and the main reason is a weak story. It's predictable, mundane, ridiculous, and the characters were without soul.One reason we loved Indy so much was his resourcefulness and ability to survive through wit and cunning. In this movie, he survives simply because the writer decides he should. Drop 300 feet from a waterfall in a car and survive, is far-fetched. Do it three times and survive?? That's a joke. Climb into a refrigerator to survive an atomic blast... maybe. Do it less than a mile from ground zero? That's a joke.Find a highly magnetic artifact that draws metal objects from across the room... maybe. Have gun wielding Russians transport it and their guns don't get stuck to it?

1916,charliemrph,Indiana Jones legacy,6,31 May 2008,"I walked into theater expecting to come out humming the Indiana Jones theme, like I always do when I finish watching the first three. Instead, I came out scratching my head, with a confused expression in my face. All I can think of is... all this waiting... for this?True, we all have grown up, and our perspective of things have changed. Yes, CGI is the way to go nowadays. Of course! This movie was made to make big bucks. Nevertheless, once the movie was over, I was left with the feeling that something was missing... besides the whip.DEPTH. Indiana Jones 4 is missing depth in the story. Indiana Jones was never about how visually impressive the scenes can be, no matter how real CGI can look. It was about a struggle between right and wrong; good versus evil, with a clear story line that even a 12 year old could understand. It's true that the first three movies had some level of illogical or even fantastical scenes, but they were acceptable. The monkey-rope scene, the sword fighting scene, and even the waterfall scenes are just WAY too much. Lucas and Spielberg put a whole of a more effort into realistic scenes in the first three movies, that I was expecting the same in the last one. The pace in the first three movies was slower, and they took their time to take you into the story. You could appreciate the plot, the REAL scenery... the moment. All that was gone when most of the scenes, if not all, in the last one were shot up- close. Emphasis in key moments was missing, such like in Raiders of the Lost ark, when Indy and Marcus are informed that the Nazis are looking for the Well of Souls, or the story about the Sankara stones in Temple of Doom. I still think that Lucas and Spielberg could have found a better way to shoot this movie.Bigger, faster, better is not always good.The movie itself is OK. Fighting scenes could have been a little more creative. They could have use MUCH less CGI and more real scenery and physically plausible things.I am a 29 year-old fan of Indiana Jones. I have already lost count of how many times I have watched the first 3 movies, and I don't think I am going to stop watching them any time soon.

Back to the movie; I was able to overlook the superhero traits Indy seems to have, the thing that ruined my evening was the absolute lack off storytelling, there wasn't a satisfying plot, most of the theories Lucas presents are theories from Erick Von danniken who believed that interstellar travelers of mars or a tenth planet which is now gone in our solar system(near Pluto i believe), gave us knowledge of irrigation, architecture and what not.

The plot was very interesting and is based on semi-true ideas including the Nazca Lines, and the crystal skulls. The movie altogether was very exciting including the car chase scene which had you up on your seats the whole time. This movie destroys Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom. Indiana Jones and The Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the best over all and then the Last crusade but this beats The Temple Of Doom by a mile. The special effects were top notch and I am sure It will get some Academy Award nominations including John Williams Music on the movie. I recommend seeing the movie the plot was interesting but it will keep you very excited through out the movie. I gave it a 9/10 for it's great story.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1920,bin_me,"An over-indulgent movie, but good nonetheless.",6,2 June 2008,"The problem with this film is that it leans too heavily on the three highly superior, previous Indiana Jones movies. The film relies on its devoted audience to pick up on certain jokes, which unless traced back to the three originals, are bland and unnecessary to newer audiences. Unfortunately, it does not stand by itself as a strong storyline .Whereas the first three films do not rely on each other for support (except some small, humorous blink-and-you'll-miss-'em jokes thrown in, such as the reference to the Ark of the Covenant from Raiders in the tomb in Venice in the Last Crusade), this fourth addition is littered with references: Marion Ravenwood returns as the love interest of Indy, which is nice if a little awkward and dull for younger-viewers. Disappointingly, through no fault of Karen Allen, seemingly due to a poor script (which I shall complain about later) she is given so little to do except drive a car around and giggle at inappropriate moments, such as when driving over a cliff and happening to land on a tree which releases them perfectly into a river. Where are the genius scenes of dialogue which made the first three films so great? Nowhere to be seen. Instead, the audience is expected to string the pieces together. For younger viewers: who the hell is Marion Ravenwood? And why does Indy refer to Abner's little girl? Who is Abner? etc etc.Also, a ridiculous reference to Star Wars (a bored Lucas desperately reminiscing about his franchise?): ""I've got a bad feeling about this..."" Anyway, the love interest is weak unless supported by Raiders; the significance of the warehouse at the beginning and the brief shot of the Ark of the Covenant is much less interesting without, again, Raiders to support it. (And it annoyed me how they ruined the reverence and awe-inspiring power of the Ark by leaving it disregarded in the remnants of a shattered wooden box, they should have left it alone).Moving on: the storyline. A weak quest to return a skull to some Aztec/ Mayan/ Southern American ancient city- something to do with El Dorado. I had this horrible feeling when we were first shown this alien hand frozen in the warehouse... but I dismissed it and hoped it would be explained as something else. Then Cate Blanchett, the villain, again dampened by a poor script and storyline, who should have been far more threatening and camp to succeed, opened a zip-bag revealing... a dead alien! Please, another explanation No such luck.The story, apparently themed around the science-fiction era of the 1950s- with Roswell, along with Communism, decided to focus on Aliens. A disappointing ending: a circle of crystal skeletons of aliens which came to life... Blanchett died in a CGI-ed way, with her eyes burning up and eventually her whole body aflame. Ironically, the similar deaths of Belloq, Toht and the Nazi general in Raiders, although without CGI, were far more effective. Then the space-ship appeared out of the ancient ruins and flied away. Meanwhile, Indy and family watched happily close by, unscathed, making some cheesy comments about ""Junior"" and ""Dad"".CGI. Just because you can does NOT mean you should. The first three films were so much more realistic, enjoyable and fun due to their lack of CGI. All the stunts were REAL. One can actually imagine running away from a boulder. Its possible. Its iconic. Its genius. It is extremely hard to imagine a spaceship whip out of some ancient ruins, causing a whirlpool of rocks and debris and vanishing... or aliens, or a teenager swinging through the jungle with an army of monkeys. And don't even get me started on Indy's escape from an Atomic Bomb test explosion... in a fridge.Apparently Spielberg, Lucas and Ford waited until the perfect script came along. They should have waited a bit longer. There were no genius scenes of dialogue, no such snappy banter. Instead the film was littered with action, over the top CGI indulgences, and occasionally people spoke to explain the story. A good film MUST have a GOOD PLOT AND SCRIPT TO SUCCEED. CGI IS NOT THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHINGThere are some good points. Shia LaBoef is likable and funny as Mutt Williams, the rogue (except when he becomes bloody Tarzan). There is one excellent scene in a bar, when Mutt starts a fight to help him and Indy escape some KGB agents, and all of a sudden there is a divide in the room between the greasers and the preppy jocks. Excellent. Then a great motorbike chase, where they skid through a university library, and Indy is asked calmly about an essay by a pupil amongst the chaos. Yes,although I said before her character's involvement was weak, Karen Allen returning as Marion was indeed fun.As for John Hurt, Jim Broadbent and Ray Winstone's characters: not very big parts to be honest. John Hurt was subjected to humiliation by being written as an irritating, insane character who just repeated things and looked mad. As such a brilliant talent, it was shame he was not used for greater things. Broadbent was good in the scenes he was involved in, limited to Marshall College. And Winstone was slightly annoying, a bit of an unnecessary character who cropped up everywhere and kept switching sides confusingly.I'll end it there as I have unexpectedly written far too much. However, do go and see this film, its not a complete failure. Just don't expect the genius plot, script and essence of the first three. That is long gone I'm afraid.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1921,phyllo2,sucked,4,2 June 2008,Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked. BIG TIME.Characters weren't played well. Story blew. Scenes were lame. As soon as I heard the title of this I knew we were in for another Temple of Doom. Ebert is obviously payed off but lost his credibility when he started taking bribes from movie makers years ago for good reviews so I wasn't surprised when he said he liked all 4 Indiana's. I don't know what Lucas and Spielberg were thinking. Maybe Lucas can't get passed the cardinal sin of sequels either. We constantly see the second and third movies in a series copy the exact plot line as the first jammed with over the top action to out do the first. I guess I cant blame them - just look at the money this Indy made despite the lameness.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1922,ah6912,Dumb,2,2 June 2008,"If you want to enjoy this movie, then you are going to have to turn off your logic. You are also going to have to turn off you ability to judge stupidity. The movie 'jumps the shark' when the bouf kid starts swinging on vines through the jungle and catches up to speeding vehicles.Additionally as others have stated the movie lacks a soul, has poor acting and is extremely contrived. I think the characters and events were selected firs then the plot was forced to fit. The kid was the best part of the movie and he is usually terrible (transformers). The only good thing about it is a couple of good one line.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1923,danr01,Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Phantom Menace,4,3 June 2008,"(Ahh it's 1998 George Lucas's mind has yet to be taken over by aliens, the new 'Star Wars' film's just around the corner and life's great!)Then you wake up.Urggg! what a mess this film is!I thought I was going to see an 'Indiana Jones' film, not an 'Indiana Jones' cartoon. If I wanted to watch cute little CGI animals I would of rented 'Toy Story' or ""Monsters Inc' or something, something that at least had a story that made sense. It's as if Spielberg was aiming the film at 8 year olds, where as the originals could be enjoyed by everyone.I can't believe, reading through some of the comments here on IMDb that some people are defending this piece of ****. They say ah, lighten up man they're just movies, go in with low expectations, just because you cant have a good time doesn't mean it's a bad film. If your going into a film with low expectations, why the hell are you going in, you've just payed for it?And anyway these aren't just movies. They haven't lasted so long because they're just movies. They haven't gripped audiences new and old and become part of popular culture for no reason. Were 'the Beatles' just a band?! no! Great art stands the test of time. So to with the original 'Indiana Jones' films, don't think they're anything less just because they're 'popcorn action films'. It's films like these that make getting through the day to day slog just that bit easier, and deserve more respect.Some people are giving this film 10 stars?? Now I don't have a problem if you enjoyed it but, come on, no one can say it's perfect!! if you give this a 10 what do you give 'The Godfather""? But then, if you look at the early reviews of the 'Phantom menace' you will find plenty of positive reviews claiming it's awesomeness, but they soon started to dry up.If you're like me, reading through IMDb and dismayed by peoples willingness to be force fed this sort of rubbish over and over, please take five minutes to write an honest review of your own and give this film the mark it deserves. If you like it so be it, just don't give it a **** 10!Is it the worst film of all time? no. Is it the most disappointing film I have ever seen? yes, (and that includes the 'Phantom Menace'). I didn't even have a problem with the alien premise as such either - it's just the lame beat you over the head way it was implemented. It's only saving grace is that it doesn't really effect the originals in the way that the Star Wars prequels do.... Also, I just don't understand some of Spielbergs comments before the films release - he said he was making it in the same spirit as his earlier films as he didn't want it to seem out of place,..... why then does it look like a **** computer game. He said he made this film for the fans, well now we know what he thinks of the fans, and he's busy scraping us of the sole of his shoe.This is my first and last review on IMDb - no offence intended to anyone, I just need to get I few things of my chest.The 4(out of 10) stars go to a fine cast making the most of a dire script, the fist 20 minutes, and an odd laugh(the intentional ones anyway). The rest is a mess and you're fooling yourself if you think otherwise!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1924,seamus-68,Indiana Jones and the Debacle of the Crystal Numbskulls,1,3 June 2008,"I knew it was going to be bad. I just didn't expect it to be UNFORGIVABLY TERRIBLE.It breaks my heart, really. The Indiana Jones trilogy is like scripture to me. They are among my favorite movies; I consider them to be works of sheer brilliance. I even went to college intending to study Archaeology. The fact that this impeccable mythos has now been disgraced with this latest, putrid addition to the Indiana Jones franchise literally pains me.Why, Spielberg, why? I mean, I knew that George Lucas had lost his mind. I saw the Star Wars prequels. I knew that he had, apparently, abandoned all sense of taste, artistry, and drama. I knew that he had it in him to ruin a good thing.But Steven, I thought you knew better. I figured that you wouldn't let George ruin this one, that you'd be the voice of reason that would save Indiana Jones from the embarrassing fate that befell Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Darth Vader. I guess I was wrong.It seems that George Lucas is hell-bent on destroying everything beautiful that he's ever created. What's next, a soulless, shamelessly merchandized sequel to American Graffiti? I wonder if he beats his children.I expected that it would be Shia LeBeouf who would ruin this movie. Ever since I was subjected to Keanu Reeves' Constantine, I've had nothing but distaste for Shia, whose vast repertoire encompasses both the whiny, obnoxious motormouth as well as the back-talking, disagreeable jerk. It would be safe to say that Shia LeBeouf is probably my least favorite actor of all time. When I first beheld the poorly-Photoshopped Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull poster that featured Harrison Ford and Shia LeBeouf standing next to each other, smiling like a pair of chumps, I wept inside.However, I was wrong. It wasn't Shia LeBeouf who ruined this movie. He actually did a decent job, as far as acting in bad movies goes.I'm blaming Lucas. The credits say ""Story by George Lucas,"" and I know that he's metamorphosed into a talentless dork in his old age, so I'm blaming him. I'm also blaming Spielburg for not slapping some sense into him and agreeing to direct this amateurish, big-budget fiasco.The movie starts out terribly, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth right off the bat. It plays like an outlandish rip off of the Hills Have Eyes. And if there's one thing an Indiana Jones flick shouldn't do, it's retread ground previously covered by the Hills Have Eyes.I eventually started digging the movie when it got political, taking jabs at the repression of the 50s and the idiocy of the McCarthyist establishment. I started digging it a lot more when the greasers and jocks began brawling at the diner. There's something truly archetypical and unabashedly American about a gang war between leather jacket clad rockers and letterman jacket clad conformists. It reminded me of high school. I loved it.The film maintained this momentum from the brawl with a motorcycle chase and a trip to South America. However, it soon began to slow down, fizzling out in a puddle of unoriginal mediocrity and ultimately stewing in its own ridiculousness. The film shortly transformed into a tired, second rate knock-off of King Kong, Pirates of the Caribbean, Apocalypto, and Independence Day.In no time at all I found myself watching, slack-jawed, as Shia LeBeouf swung across poorly rendered CGI vines with a pack of digitally rendered monkeys.It was at this point that I wanted to slit George Lucas' fat throat.Later, I found myself observing what was possibly the most generic, contrived, and thoroughly unoriginal computer graphic alien ascend into space in a UFO.It was at this point that I wanted to burn the script to this atrocious movie in front of Steven Spielberg's face.Indiana Jones movies are supposed to be about history and mythology, not about science fiction clichés. I really don't know what the hell these guys were thinking. To boot, this film espouses the Eurocentric fallacy perpetuated by UFO geeks for decades: namely, that non-Western cultures (Egyptians, Aztecs, Incas, etc.) were too primitive to have built monuments such as the pyramids and the ziggurats, ergo these structures were actually built under the supervision of extra-terrestrial aliens. This hypothesis has always been a crock of bull, a symptom of the sad fact that imperialists over the centuries opted to burn libraries rather than learn from other cultures. There are a multitude of superior myths that could've been used to far better results in an Indy flick than this hackneyed and ultimately racist drivel.And, in what was perhaps the ultimate sacrilege of the film, Indy gets married at the end. There are two men in the world of film who are never supposed to get married: namely James Bond and Indiana Jones. These characters thrive as archetypical rakes who have a different love interest in every subsequent movie. To tie one of them down is to castrate the character and destroy his mystique. Essentially, this is exactly what happened to Indiana Jones.The plot of this movie reads like it was written by a fifth grader. Indeed, a fifth grader could've done a better job. I could've too, for that matter. Either Spielberg and Lucas are so over-confident that they think they can film fecal matter and it will sell millions, or they are surrounded by an army of yes-men who are too nerdy to advise their idols on matters of good taste and continuity.Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Skip this one; it will only break your heart.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1925,avalonia-1,It could have been better,5,3 June 2008,"After all these troubles regarding the screenplay for Indy 4 I was expecting something very ""out of this world"", but not in the sense of the sentence! When rumors started that aliens will be part of this Indiana Jones movie, and were confirmed by this magnetic ""roswell-box"" in the trailer, my jaw was dropping: an archaeologist making a ""close encounter of the first kind""? In the very last scenes, I expected Agent Fox Moulder from the X-Files to appear. Was that the essence of 19 years in the making? I don't know what Frank Darabount's screenplay was about, but since dear Mr. ""I know Best"" Lucas rejected it, it must have been far more better. The movie was entertaining, but it lacks what the first three movies had. I left the cinema with twisted feelings, after all these fuzz I expected more, much more. There is not much left of the old Spielberg movie-making: new images, excitement, characters, scenery etc. It looks more like ""we have to do this now and fast"". And what I do not understand are the goofs. For a talented filmmaker like Spielberg, and all the people involved in post production, why are the mustard and Ketchup bottles upright after they fell down on the table? And many more. In all Spielberg movies are a lot of goofs. Why? Are they dreaming? Doesn't the continuity sleeps all the time? Is the Cutter blind? So many CGI, so much money, and the can't keep the Bootles Up? Or down? Dear Mr. Lucas, dear Mr. Spielberg, between 1975 and 1989 you enjoyed us with your movies. Your fame and ""fortune and glory"" were paid by our admission to the movies, why are you ignoring us? The Star Wars prequel was a disaster for the all of us. And now Indiana Jones?

1927,chadzy-1,Am I in the right cinema?,6,11 June 2008,"I can't just go along with everybody else and say that this movie was great, but I can't say that it was awful. After seeing this movie, it was good to see that it still retained the basic elements of Indiana Jones, there were myths, lots of adventure and of course, the trusty old whip.The one thing that seemed out of place were the aliens. In fact, once during in the movie, I turned to my friend and asked whether we were in the right cinema because the first half -> three quarters of the movie seemed like Indiana Jones, but then out of nowhere, aliens appeared. It seemed way out the regular, generic model of Indiana Jones. I will have to quote my friend on this ""the old movies were about a myth that turned out to be real in some corner of the world, but this one almost questioned our whole reality"".If it turned out that it was just a tribe of South Americans, rather than supreme aliens, this movie would have been very different.--- To sum up, even though this was a great film, anyone who has seen an Indiana Jones film before may be disappointed, just be ready for wormholes, aliens, UFOs and just about anything extraterrestrial.

1928,Derelict_Frog,Just terrible,1,7 June 2008,"I expected the film to follow suit and be excellent, as with the other Indy films; not only was it not as good as the others but it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Not wanting to give any plot information away to those who want to see it (my advice however is just to not bother) I can point out myriad continuity errors and the violations of the laws of physics in this film almost reached the levels of 'The Core'. The dialogue was corny, the CGI at times just did not fit in and the acting was not ship-shape (especially the Russian accents), as I'd expect from an Indy film.But the worst problem with the film was the addition of aliens. It didn't fit in with the traditional religious / cultish theme of the Indy films, and if it were meant to be a change, it wasn't a very good one. Subsequently this led to a loss of charm, which the other Indy films had. It was also less credible, which although all the Indy films are meant to be slightly surreal and imaginative, they were exactly on the boundary between absurd and enjoyable, and this film pushed that boundary with the addition of aliens and 'ninja-zombie' natives.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I purchased a ticket knowing that the movie wasn't going to be sophisticated, but would at least be entertaining. I left the movie feeling like I needed therapy! I can suspend my disbelief just fine, but there were so many ridiculous holes in this movie that I found myself laughing out loud way too often. I grew up loving Indiana Jones, but I can't love this movie. A good place to start is by reading all of the mistakes that were made in making the movie.

Yes the previous IJ movies had some ""supernatural"" aspects to them but not on the completely ridiculous scale as this movie.I am a huge Harrison Ford fan and his acting along with Shia LaBeouf were the only saving grace to this movie.I am glad I went to a matinée for this movie....and yet I still want my $4.50 back....If you must see it - wait till its out on video...in a redbox b/c its not really even worth the $1 to rent.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Anyone except for my own. I loved this movie. From start to finish I thought it stayed with the Original Trilogy, and added a new frontier with the Indy Series. I have been a long time follower with the Indy Trilogy, from Raiders to the Crusade, and now KOTCS. The plot is simply amazing, and for that time frame (1950's) makes perfect sense. I mean sure surviving a Atomic Blast kinda pushes the envelope, but ripping someone's heart out is OK? What do people expect from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. First off, Lucas Produced, and Steven Directed! Lets not forget that. It seems that Lucas cant catch a break no matter where he goes. I personally feel this movie took Indy to new heights. Each movie of the Series spoke of a different religion/ culture / civilization. As soon as the topic of E.T. are involved its automatically a bad thing? From the start it had me in suspense, and had many references to prior Trilogy Events which I thought was amazing. the characters had so much depth to them, and making Indy older, wiser, but still arrogant, thick skulled person we have grown to love. What do people want? Another Raiders or Temple of Doom? Its not going to happen, and personally I am glad it didn't happen. I don't want to watch a Indy movie where they try and do the same thing all over again, and again, and again. All in all, People are never satisfied, no matter what.

I think the obsession with CGI has reached new lows with this film, just because you can does not mean you should throw everything at the screen. Having just re watched the first three films and then going to see this you would not think the same people were involved.Go and see it but be warned this is not like the Indiana Jones you know from the first three movies, for me it was a disappointing as the HULK and Batman & Robin. Lucas and Spielberg you owe us a good movie to make up for this rubbish. I am still amazed that it is so bad, I know it was a 50's inspired movie supposed to be a bit different to watch, I got all those references including Shia as Marlon Brando but nothing makes up for the second half, and as for the tracking devices, were they really just brake light bulbs from a car !

Spielberg and Lucas have made more money than can be spent in a 1000 life times, so it can't be about making more money, CAN IT?? someone please help me figure this one out, its beyond me. Ford, Stevens, Capra,and especially Wilder and Lean ( who knew how to deliver the epic )have to be rolling in their graves about this pure grab for the money. No need to go into great detail regarding all the failures here,the numerous comments on this site have summed it all up. I'll just comment on the most silly, unbelievable, unrealistic stunts that completely had me in total disbelieve.The jungle chase: 100 mph for a 100 miles smother than driving down a newly paved HWY in a Rolls Royce??? If this was a return glimpse of the truck chase in Raiders, you guys fell far from the mark.

1939,pvynrtczbx3,Complete rubbish!,1,9 July 2008,"Sure enough like most people i was really looking forward to the fourth, long awaited Indiana Jones sequel.However what i expected and what i saw could not be any more different - it was completely rubbish!!! why? well this film is far too personal / emotionally orientated 1) Indiana Jones discovers that the women who he divorced/separated from was pregnant when he left her 2) he has a son 3) Indiana Jones loses his job as a teacher 4) Indiana Jones get married 5)Indiana Jones discovers alien life. The 4th instalment was lacklustre and did not have the passion and usual thrills, spills, enemies or treasure of the previous three.also unlike the Sanskrit stones or moses commandments or the holy grail which had to be recovered in the first three Indiana Jones the thing at stake here is some psychic telepathic weapon (So dull!) one more thing is that Harrison Ford looks too old and too ragged in this movie, he really needs to hang up his hat!!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The beauty of Indy is that he gets out of real-world scrapes through sheer guts and luck, but some of the stuff we're expected to believe here is heart-breakingly stupid.

I'm no fan boy, I'm no Indy geek, but I GET the heart of the previous three movies, I felt and loved everything Indy did and went through. Here, unfortunately, were treated to a pathetic plot, weak enemies, a revolting over use of CG (don't believe the hype folks, there's buckets of the stuff), and an ending that beggars belief.

There is no point in hiding, if someone drops an atomic bomb near you, you'll be dead if you are lucky.

1942,Voldo890,Spielberg & Co did an excellent job!,7,15 July 2008,"This certainly is an underrated movie. Many have claimed that ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" has ruined the old movies and that it sucks compared to them. I beg to differ.This movie is much like the old ones and that might actually be the reason why so many dislike it. It's style and concept is no different from them and I guess that's why people think TKotCS is bad. Because it is very much like an old movie, but with improved effects. Everything is still there; the humor, the excitement and the charm.Right at the start of the movie when Indy lifts up his at and the old melody began to play, I started to smile and I didn't stop smiling until the movie was over. I knew that I was not going to be disappointed, and I was totally right. The tempo verifies a lot, sometimes it's going really fast and sometimes it's pretty slow. But it evens out almost perfectly. The use of CGI is very smooth and they don't use too much of it.The actors are absolutely fantastic. Harrison Ford is just like the old Indiana Jones we know. Cate Blanchett proves once more that she is one of the finest actresses alive today. It would not surprise me if the Academy Award members gave her attention for this role. John Hurt does an interesting interpretation of his character as well.But of off course there is a little negative side to the movie. The characters are just too many. We have Indy, Mutt, Irina, Marion, Mac and Ox. Plus all the communists and hooligans and whatever they are, (no offense).And some have complained about the story being too unnatural. Well what did you expect? It's Indiana Jones for Christ's sake. It would be unnatural if it wasn't unnatural.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I would like to see a bit of a new direction taken if the series continues...move Harrison Ford into the position of father/trainer/mentor (as Sean Connery's example) and Shia LeBeuf into budding archaeologist/adventurer position...thus creating the next generation. Ford can still do adventuring but leave the heavy athletics to LeBeuf. And how much fun would it be to have a sequence wherein Connery, Ford and LeBeuf interact.

I heard the original script dealt with the real (or fake) crystal skulls. They could have made them look the same and still said they were alien. All of the other films were based on real myths so why did this one just go Hollywood. Watch the History's channel episode of crystal skulls. This movie was done poorly and I think its because the people who made it are already so rich they just don't have to try anymore. (like Quentin Tarantino).

Steven Spielberg and George Lucas must have lost their heads. Hard to believe that these people gave us the original trilogy! But I think they have depleted all their creativity in making all those great movies like ET, STAR WARS, etc. They have nothing left in their brain. Otherwise STAR WARS prequel and WAR OF THE WORLDS couldn't have come onto this earth. We know it, they don't. Indy became the helpless victim of their lost heads.

1952,calando55,"Entertaining, visual arresting, but doesn't measure up to the previous installments",6,14 October 2008,"Well one of the faults is the obvious, they shouldn't have waited almost twenty years to add another installment to the legendary Indiana Jones Saga. Which I think everyone who sees it feels that Spielberg and Lucas really have gotten old and lost touch with visual storytelling.Money and fame shouldn't suggest to stop trying and put as much as effort as you did before. It's the reason why Lucas and Spielberg became famous is because they put effort into development through post production.This Indiana Jones, although still maintained the comic-book feel in the cinematography and production design, still can not make up for the lack of approach. The first three films were going for the old serial films of the late 40's and this one feels like Rebel Without A Cause trying to be Indiana Jones.Plus Lucas being all hard up on CGI shows poorly in this film, the CGI in this film makes Terminator 2 still be outstanding. ILM who has changed the world of special effects forever, is sloppy and cheesy in this film, and this being Spielberg's most expensive film to date with a budget of $125 million and it being ILM they could have done a much better job with the visual effects. Pablo Helmen the films visual effects supervisor should not be one at all. he should be doing video games its what the CGI looked like.However, the film is still a marvelous piece of visual art and landscape, one of the only things that still is here from the previous films. it is a very entertaining film, with great action sequences. The writing of the film is done by well known David Keopp who wrote the Jurassic Parks, and Spider-Man. although not a bad writer and this film is not that poorly written it still feels like they're trying to put nostalgia from the 50's and trying too hard to make in the same universe as the last three films.The only other thing that was odd about the film is that you also feel that Spielberg is trying too hard to be who he was in 1980, by trying to reconnect with his old routes with aliens. the alien in this film feels and looks to much like Close Encounters.The thing about the last three films is they all have to do with either religious beliefs or religious artifacts, something i was felt gave Indiana Jones more soul and heart to Indiana Jones' goals and conflicts. And just when this one feels like its going to be the same thing, its about aliens. Spielberg i think should drop the alien theme or if not, only make the film about aliens. Indiana Jones is not about alien artifacts and has not ever. I respect the concept but its not for this franchise.In the end, its not necessarily a bad film, just it shows that Spielberg and Lucas are just too old now.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1953,bodawaywindrider,For all the Indy haters out there,9,18 October 2008,"OK, maybe as a 41 year old who loved the original Indy films I may be a bit biased, but I loved this film. maybe it is a nostalgia thing. From the moment the classic theme started I was hooked. Harrison Ford WAS still Indy, and I was on the edge of my seat wondering what trick was up next. Yes there were some over the top elements,like the fridge, but as my husband and I sat watching we both were yelling ""Get in the fridge"". The one liners, as always, were on point, and the characters were believable, yet over the top as always. There was always a certain ""characterization"" to the characters in the films, almost ""cartoonish"" but not quite. That feeling was definitely still there. Indy was always about the next crazy feat, the next absurd situation, the next quick verbal crack, and they got this one right. Maybe I am still a 41 year old yearning for my youth, but as I told my husband I am actually sorry we didn't pay to watch this one on the big screen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1954,mandgarten,Kingdom of the Complete Failure,3,20 November 2008,"Steven Spielberg used to be my favourite director when I was a teenager, back in the simple, glorious Eighties. His films were exciting and possessed a unique magic that was wonderfully emphasized by John Williams' music. Watching them was an adventure - like visiting a mysterious old-fashioned fairground. Unfortunately, those days are gone. ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" isn't just terribly disappointing from a cinematic perspective, it's an insult to the preceding episodes. In the beginning we see the Paramount logo turn into a pile of dirt. Out pops a CGI gopher (whatever happened to animal trainers?) that's just migrated from Narnia. What a sad and appropriate omen for what's to followAt first many ingredients seem familiar: jungles, deserts, nasty insects, ancient tombs, hair-raising chases, gallons of water, the greedy villain being killed by supernatural powers. Yet gone are emotion, romance, a sense of wonder, love of detail, exotic locations, character credibility - and a good story. One can argue about the overdose of CGI and the miscasting of a crucial character, but it's impossible to present one logical argument in favour of the story. George Lucas' notion to integrate themes of science-fiction B-movies just kills the film. Why amputate the leg of a winning horse? How about combining Indy and the MGM musical in the fifth installment? Try retelling the storyline to someone who hasn't seen the movie. There's absolutely no sense in this ludicrous, disconnected potpourri: Area 51, conquistadors, extra-dimensional aliens, KGB, Maya, rock 'n' roll, an El-Dorado-like-city, blacklisting, nuclear tests, brainwashing, African ants, saucers, the Nazca glyphs If only the same amount of creativity would've gone into the development of the characters.The only part who receives a proper introduction and some depth turns out to be the Jar Jar Binks of the movie - Indy's son Fonzie Sorry, Mutt. I don't mind the idea of Indy and Marion having a son, but Shia LaBeouf sharing a family tree with Ford and Connery? The boy simply lacks the charisma to fill these shoes and appears to be utterly uninteresting. Also quite a disadvantage that he's asked to star in two of the most ridiculous action sequences ever. Ladies and gentlemen, the fencing lord of the digital apes and his amazing pain resistant testicles.Cate Blanchett's Colonel Spalko (or ""Ninotchka on crack"") seems as if she's about to go to a Halloween party. Her entire appearance happens to be cartoonish and exaggerated. One-dimensional cartoons are hardly threatening  or were you ever scared of Big Bad Pete? By the way, the stereotype portrayal of the ""evil Russians"" is a dispensable relic of an ugly era and in my eyes politically questionable. Karen Allen's given a rather curious introduction - she simply appears from out of nowhere in the middle of the film. Her few scenes with Ford are charming and add a much needed warmth. But then she gets into a jeep, puts on a knowingly ""we're indestructible"" grin and looks like her own stand-in throughout the rest of the film. Blame the director.John Hurt obviously got the part that was originally intended for Sean Connery. Oxley, a man who's gone mad because he was exposed to too much wisdom. Not a bad idea, which would've worked if the character displayed at least some dignity, but Oxley looks too much like a senile bum suffering from severe delirium tremens. Then there's quadruple agent Mac, a jolly Cockney version of Sallah, who's actually more mysterious than the crystal skull. His only function is to trigger irrelevant minor plot twists and yell ""Jonesey"" from time to time - until his weird and inexplicable departure into ""the space between spaces"". Ray Winstone would've deserved a bone with more meat. And finally Harrison Ford who delivers a fine performance that suits both his age and the role. In fact, he's the only element that holds the movie together.The first half of Indy 4 is tolerable - apart from a minor catastrophe involving a fridge and an atom bomb. The turning point is the jungle chase. Here it starts to drown in a maelstrom of absurd and illogical action sequences that are taking place in a ""more-real-than-reality-itself"" green screen environment. The Betty Ford Clinic should consider opening a new ward for CGI addicted directors The film's already in a state of rigor mortis when the wedding ceremony takes place - which would've been a beautiful way to end the series.What a wasted chance - and an awful shame that today's children and teenagers are being robbed of the movie magic that I experienced when I was young. Back then it would've never occurred to me that my memories would become such a rare treasure.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1955,slapshot2929,Indian Jones- Skull,8,10 November 2008,"Review: Indiana Jones has been an original action movie for the past 20 years, and a movie that I grew up watching and enjoying the theme park rides at Disney World as a child. I feel that this movie did not get the reward that is should have had. The first thing that I want to say about this film is that I thought thought that the graphics were amazing and did not look fake at all. I also thought that the story line followed the original series that I grew up on and did not loose its originality. This movie was suppose to be corny at points and a bit silly, just like the original one and I am glad that they did not take away from that. Everything about this movie was worth the money, it had great characters, great directors, and great producers.

1956,aroll605,Strangely not so good,4,30 November 2008,"Impossible to compare to previous movies of Indiana Jones. Ford is too old for all the tricks that he did and since when we have aliens involved? Did suddenly George Lucas ran out of imagination? Ford's jokes are expected and not so funny, events trivial and not surprising, very few elements of suspense. The storyline is somewhat interesting but the ending was illogical and unsatisfying, more like of an excuse to just end the movie and get some box office money. That's too bad. Let's not forget the fridge scene, when Indiana saved himself from a Nuclear explosion just hiding in one and flying for about a mile in the air, landing and surviving without a scratch. Quite a disappointment but, not a bad time killer.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1957,antiantagonist,"Good acting, Poor Directing, Poor Story",2,23 May 2008,"Every actor nailed their characters, and any actor from previous films felt as if they defined the role very well.Unfortunately the pacing of the plot and cinematography were extremely stale. Throughout the film there would either be weird overhead lighting that made the characters all look like they were getting baked or very even lighting that would highlight nothing. These two types of lighting would make sense in certain scenes but in many others would not. The overhead lighting seemed more of a callback to particular scenes from the previous films, but without any of the accompanying thought that went with them. This film seemed averse to having close-ups. While this allowed the whole gang to stay on camera more often it meant that each actor was left with less space to characterize themselves.The plot film was like a fan fiction for the first half, with Indy narrowly escaping several incidents (the scale of which) do make any sense in relation to any previous films. This break made the difference between Indy 'surviving by the skin of his teeth' and being led through half the story in a fashion normally left for annoying deus ex machina endings. The thematic choices also break from previous films, going from noir/pulp undertones to over the top action while the creeping dread, mysticism, and cultural conflict get replaced with confusing sci-fi. The sci-fi aspect is a bold undertaking, that with the proper considerations could have made an exciting part of the series, but in this case fell short. The story could have also benefited from the conflict of uneasy noir (representing the feeling that the world was about to end from 1930s/WWII) with a theme representing the new decade, such as hope for a better tomorrow, or overbearing danger from the cold war. These themes actually seemed to be at roll call at the shooting of certain scenes, but skipped school for the rest of the day.In comparison to other revivals and remakes in the last 2 years this has a been a bust. By itself it's just boring. Save your money, or go see something else.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1958,cc_rider_1,Very Indy!,10,19 December 2008,"I always found the first 3 films to be excellent, with perhaps the third one the weakest.Now we all got older, and so did Indy.When I first heard of the new film being made, I wasn't sure that it was a good idea. However I find it to be very true to the first three. And it is a really entertaining chapter in the Indy story.Its well played no doubt. Spielberg and the actors does their job well.Lucas managed to expand Indy from a Bond character to a more tired yet wiser character. Instead of romance there is a father-son relationship thats in focus. I even find that this film explored that relationship better than Connery/Ford did in Crusaders. The characters evolve more in this film.I was quite happy that Lucas turned away from the religious supernatural themes and instead gave us aliens.The action is really well executed and has that Indy quality and feeling to it. If someone get irritated of the logic of the action, then one must remember that this is the same Indy that jumped in a cole wagon, survived going under a military truck in high speed, flew a raft... the list goes on. And thats the Indy action I loved as a kid, and thats the Indy action the audience still get.The music also has that Indy quality, and it still gives the film that great feeling it did in the other films.I think that this film deserves its own place in the Indy saga.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

1960,Hobnob1979,What a disappointment,4,29 May 2008,"First of all, I have to admit that some of the special effects looked amazing, particularly the door-opening sequence that led to the Crystal Skull chamber and the swirling of rocks that were submerged under a deluge of river water. CGI has come a long way and Indy showcased some of the best examples of its progress. But that's the only(but worthy) good point of this pretty awful film. The other three Indy's weren't just about action - it was the witty script, the banter between characters and the sense of adventure which made the series the Legend it is today. And this film has very little of it. Ray Winstone in particular was dreadful. I don't know exactly what the screenwriter wanted to make of his character - a lovable rogue, Indy's best buddy through thick and thin, a cockney gangster even? In the end all I heard him say was ""Jonesy!"" ""Jonesy!"" ""Jonesy!"" ""Jonesy!"". He had no chemistry with Harrison Ford at all which was obvious from the very first ""joke"" about Mac betting Indy 500 pounds they'd get out alive. Flat as a pancake. He for me was the second most important character behind Shia LaBoeuf, but his dialogue, and the way Winstone handled it, were truly abysmal. John Hurt was given sod-all to do in this film, except say ""Henry Jones Junior"" a thousand times. And I'm sorry, but Karen Allen should never have come back - she was embarrassingly bad in this film. Again, the bad script didn't help but her overall handling of it was poor.On the upside, both Harrison Ford and Shia LaBoeuf were likable and some of the best scenes came from the interplay between them. Cate Blanchett was by far the most rounded character even if her dodgy accent took some getting used to. She looked like she was enjoying her role and some of the interplay between her and Indy was very entertaining. Overall though, the banter between the main characters was at times forced and mostly embarrassingly bad. What a shame.I have to mention the music too, which must be one of John William's laziest efforts. Ripping off original music from the first three films, not to mention Star Wars, Minority Report and Harry Potter, there is not one tune which I could associate with Indy IV. Terrible.And lastly, the story/story telling. I've heard there were problems with the script and story and it really does show. There was no build up of excitement or suspense - the viewer was just thrust from one scene into another without knowing why they were going there. Why on earth were capoeira-fighting Mayans(if that's what they were) hiding in the ruins? What was the relevance of Mutt's bike? He looked like he cared for it in England, then he looked like he cared for it on the plane, but then once it had been captured by the Russians, it was completely ignored. I don't mind if the Crystal Skulls are from aliens flying in UFOs, but don't just spring it upon the viewers 10 minutes from the end!!! When John Hurt, mysteriously brought back to his old self after returning the crystal skull, said they were inter-dimensional beings I burst out laughing - what tosh! Was that Spielberg's idea or Lucas's? Gold's not magnetic...so why was it attracted to the crystal skull? Not my question but Shia LaBeouf's question. Good question.It's a film symptomatic of today's modern blockbusters ignoring the script and direction and focusing on the action. It's certainly come a long way from the first big blockbuster, Jaws.

In the last 10 years, his movies looks like bad cartoons,no story,no acting,no nothing....! Maybe he should forget about CGI for a while and go back to making movies with some content which looks more convincing. The forth Indy was so pathetic that I couldn't watch it till the end, Spielberg just managed to ruin the magic of the first three Indys and it's a pity.

1964,Luinsereg,A fine one,9,18 June 2009,"I really think that this is exactly the same kind of film than the original trilogy. And this is how any of those films would have been made nowadays. It is almost perfect in its style. I'm not a big fan of action films in general but the extra element of Indiana Jones films make me love these. This one is not an exception, maybe not better, but surely neither so worse. Arqueologic- supernatural things, action, and Indy. Even the plot is the logical at that time, (remember Indiana Jones and Star Wars were always a tribute to the old serials and B-side movies), the adaptation to Indy's age is really well done.Let me remember that the Know-it-all dudes with glasses who now consider Star Wars or Raiders masterpieces of the genre. Were the same ones that back in 1977 an later said that those films were trash. And that is basically what happens now. It is true that those films brought a new and fresh style, but after the first one, second or fourth is the same point.Of course you may not like the film or the whole saga, but I think it is just an emotional matter if you love the first three and not this one.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1965,Wil-movies,Is This a Video Game??,1,24 May 2008,"I felt like I was watching a video game, where the little guy you control loses his life, disappears with a ""poof"", and reappears alive and well to fight on to the next level. That's OK for a video game, but not for an Indy movie.I think all those scores of ""10"" came in from the movie crew at first, trying to save this film long enough so folks would pay to see it. Now the real people are voting, and the average vote will keep going down as more of us tell you what this film is really like.In the other films we could imagine that Indy was smart and quick enough to survive all that came at him, but no longer. Any human being (let alone our old, tired, Indy) would have been killed many times over in this film, but we are expected to believe that Indy could survive all of these things without dying - no way, Jose! It is all too unbelievable, just like a video game, and that disappoints his fans who grew to admire him in the other films. In this film he dies (or should have) many times over, and just keeps jumping up to do it all again in the next scene.I feel sorry for Ford - he appears to be sick, hardly able to get through this film. I predict we will soon learn that he is sick in real life. I think Lucas just tried to do him one last favor by putting him in this movie to make some money for his old age, but Ford is too far gone to really act any more in this kind of film.He no longer does things alone and relies on himself, as he did in the other films - now other people have to think for him, tell him what to do, drive for him, protect him, do things for him. He should have hung up the hat and whip while he could leave us with the great memories from his other films. All he does now is yell to the other characters to be careful, because things are dangerous out there. How sad.Did you notice that they dubbed in someone else's voice at times when Ford could not say the lines correctly (especially near the beginning of the film)?? You can hear the background echo, the noise level, and other things change when someone else's voice was inserted in post-production to say the lines better than Ford can do now.In the old films good-old-Indy would disbelieve things until he saw them for himself. Now he just accepts things that others have told him, with no sense of wonder as he discovers things for himself. He just plods along with an expression on his face that says, ""I sure hope this scene is over soon, so I can sit down."" Where are all the things that made him unique, magical, funny, and believable before in the other Indy movies? All gone...... Now they hope you will just enjoy the special effects and not notice that they had to drag and push Ford around through this (hopefully, please) last Indy movie. No snappy dialog. Very little new music. Nothing but a rehash of the old gags. Rest in peace, Indiana Jones.This fish is dead, and it smells. Bury it, please, and move on.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1966,LorenSKMiller,Does not rise to the level of Raiders.,4,13 September 2009,"First off, I would like to say that this movie was generally fun to watch. The first movie I truly loved in my entire life, was Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I saw in 1981 in the theater when I was four or five years old, and I love it just as much today. There was something about this movie in certain scenes which had the same ambiance as Raiders, and to me the ambiance of a film is very important. I do not mind the fact that Harrison Ford is old, any more than I cared that Sean Connery was REALLY old in the Last Crusade. I happen to like Shia LeBeouf, and I also think Cate Blanchett was great, and also extremely sexy. But then I always love Cate. Just the same, there are too many flaws in this film. Basically, these are the result of excess on the part of Spielberg. Overuse of CGI is my main complaint. Another reviewer said that ""implausible action scenes kill this movie"". Well, I wholeheartedly agree, and this is precisely because of the overuse of CGI. Approximately the last half of the entire movie was nothing but a computer-generated cartoon, which not only produces ridiculous action scenes that have no feel of realism, but destroys most of the ambiance. I also feel that the admixture of the supernatural idiom with space aliens is just not classy and subtle in the way that the presentation of the supernatural is portrayed in both Raiders and the Last Crusade. Those two films will always be classics, and I don't believe the other two Indiana Jones films will. This was a squandered opportunity on the part of Spielberg, because he tried to do too much, and because of his obsession with a new technological toy: CGI. Also gone is the brilliant, subtle cinematography of the earlier Indiana Jones films which makes the viewer feel like they're flipping through the pages of an early to mid 20th century comic book. With something as spectacular as the Indiana Jones films, Spielberg should have been careful to preserve their legacy, and unfortunately this film does not rise to the level of the first and the third in the series.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1967,Slobozela,Enjoyed it...,10,27 September 2009,"This was not a movie that i expected to enjoy.I figured it was only going to be a waste of time simply because Indy was far too old for this kind of action. I was wrong. It was pleasant to watch it and the dialogues reminded me of the other movies in the series.It's fast paced but doesn't really keep you on the edge.You know how it's going to end, there's no mystery there.Although the woman playing Indy's wife seems like she's not fit for this movie.She plays a very dull and uninteresting character, even though her character could've have brought something special, being the main female character.I am looking forward for the next Indiana Jones film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Today i was in cinema and i am simply shocked what they done to my beloved doctor Jones. Harrison Ford is still good, but he has nothing to play. No epic adventure, no real enemy, dialogs are very weak. Its just instant action, without any real sense. Other actors try to do their best, but lets face it - Sean Connery, Denholm Elliot and John-Rhys Davies which were excellent in Last Crusade simply cannot be beaten.

The action scenes are embarrassing to watch and downright boring,the story(?)flat and unappealing,I felt insulted and somewhat violated by what I was seeing...Thank Goodness the theater was dark.

Everything, every single thing worked in this film. I loved every minute. You can't compare an Indiana Jones film to Casablanca, it's not meant to make you a better person, it's meant to make you forget about life for a few hours. It does that very well. From the filming style to the end. People who say they don't like it when in to see something Indy never was. They are also all wrong. As a student of American film I give this film both thumbs up.

1973,topher-neville-773-542020,Truly Amazing! - loved it!,7,17 August 2010,"For the 'reviewers' who do nothing but find fault with the film, all I can say is that it is a real shame that some people couldn't tell a quality film from a bad one if it squared up and kicked them in the behind.Purely by coincidence, I went to see Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull at the very same Curzon cinema where I had seen the first movie in my hometown in England. It was truly amazing to see the tie-up between the two movies, where Hangar 51 turns out to be the Warehouse full of crates where the Ark is taken to at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I even remembered sitting in the cinema in 1981/2 and my cousin saying to me that the ending had meant there would be another film to come, a sequel. I wasn't so sure and he just didn't know that the link would be made long after we had both grown up, my cousin being married with children of his own nearly 30 years later! This film really transported me back to the state that I was in when I saw the first Indiana Jones films, a hypnotic state of sheer wonder that I can only thank the Directors for. The atmosphere created by this beautifully made film really did that golden age of film in the early 80's justice. Leaving the cinema was the same as it had been when the experience of going really was something magical when I was a boy and it left me speechless when I left and saw the world outside. What I experienced can only be described as actual time travel. I'm not kidding, but it really did seem like Back to the Future when I left the cinema - lights everywhere, more road-markings and spaced out looking cars (a new VW Beetle in white drove past) I could not believe my eyes. Invariably the effect wore off the next morning, as it always did when I was young. Now it seems like everyone who hates the film are acting like some of the spoilt kids I knew in 1981, whose parents gave them everything but they still wanted more.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Nothing better than a 12:01am screening that has people squirming to leave throughout. I actually heard 2 people almost in unison say ""wow, that sucked"" as they got up to leave.The film has a hard time getting started, and becomes a hackneyed imitation of itself - like watching a movie version of the Indiana Jones Stunt show or heaven forbid, The Mummy.

The mystery of the crystal skulls in real life is so much more interesting than what the writer/directors gave us. I was truly disappointed with the ending. I hope to see more Indiana Jones movies in the future, but without aliens. I did enjoy most of the movie, but it did not keep me in suspense or shock me. There was something that was lost between the first two movies and this last sequel. I don't think that the amount of time dimished the glory of Indiana Jones.

1976,theotherchister,uninspired update / sequel,1,30 October 2010,"The third sequel, coming after almost 2 decades was disappointing, even after a couple of years that feeling of being robbed coming out of the cinema lingers. It's so bad on so many levels, the over use of CGI fussing over the uninspired set pieces, the sub-par plot (going by matinée action adventure plots)... the lukewarm Russian bad-guys (even Cate Blanchett couldn't do anything make things more interesting), the buddy's betrayal sub-plot, the lazy use of the whole Roswell / Alien have walked amongst us since the dawn of man conspiracy are just a few things that contribute to this mess of a film. and did I mention Harrison Ford didn't look at like he wanted to be there for pretty much the entire film...But worst of all is the entire 'handing over the franchise' plot with the 00's no.1 'handing over the franchise' go-to guy Shia LaBeouf is just plain sad and central to this being a really really bad film rather than simply just the worse entry in the series (which it is)... I imagine now that they've 'done' Wall Street, sequels where John McClane hands over the ""cop trapped in building must fight bad guy alone"" mantle to his long lost cop-son & where John Rambo finally meets his long lost (Operation Iraqi Freedom vet maybe?) son and hands over the ""wronged hero soldier"" mantle is just a couple of producer's pitch away?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1977,tyler7685,Easily better than Temple of Doom.,8,30 July 2014,Not as good as the original Raiders of course and it is a bit bloated with modern special effects but In retrospect I think it is probably my second favourite of the series. It is a fun ride and feels very much the same as the other installments of the series. This film fell victim to the modern nostalgic complaining movie fans who always have unrealistic expectations. If Temple of Doom came out today everyone would hate it. George Lucas' films in recent times seem to received with a much higher level of criticism than sequels to other franchises. It is certainly much better than the 6 of 10 rating that it has been voted. I hope they find the time to make a 5th Indiana and also look forward to the upcoming Star Wars trilogy.,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1978,ashpd24,"May not be as good as the originals, but it's still highly entertaining",8,3 May 2011,"I've never truly understood what people dislike about this movie. It seems people have some kind of double standard that says the original trilogy is allowed to be as over the top and unrealistic as it wants, yet this new movie can't even have half of that and it must be ultra realistic. The nostalgia filter is what it is, if this movie was released around the time the other movies came out, it would've been an instant hit. This movie isn't even half as goofy as Temple of Doom. So let's see, ripping guys hearts out of their chest and magic is par for the course, but a few nuclear-hardened fridges aren't. Sigh. There's no good reason why anyone dislikes the movie, just the usual ""blah blah blah nuked fridges blah blah blah"" nothing else. I for one found it a highly entertaining ride and while of course it won't be as good as the original trilogy, what can be expected? Those movies are classics, and when it first came out, Temple of Doom wasn't an instant success either. It had to do with time, and it's more fondly remembered now. All I'm saying is people shouldn't be ""stop having fun guys"" and should actually try to enjoy movies. They shouldn't cry over a few over the top elements and might not be bitter all the time about it. These films are intended to be a throwback to the old adventure serials, not some highly realistic biography. Enjoy them for what they are - fun.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1979,The_Creative_Consultant,What happened to Lucas and Spielberg?,1,26 May 2008,"There is no suspense and excitement like in the Raiders of the lost ark. When Indy goes in to a cave we know that there would be deadly traps. Or another deadly scene that makes you have at least one nightmare about it. This suspense of fear and excitement was in temple of doom and the last crusade as well. The Last Crusade was a bit more comedy but still on an respectable level.This felt more like a bad National Treasure Copy (grandpa style). I actually brought my whole family to see the return of Indiana Jones. And we all agreed that this was certainly not the Indy that we learned to know in the past.The only good thing about this film is the first twenty minutes. After that it's going downhill straight into nothingness. Even that they could have done much better. I have never written a comment ever about a film cause I always respected the writers, producers and directors for at least try something. Especially George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.But this I have to say was far below my expectations. The main thing is centered around light hearted entertainment that probably will sell a lot of tickets to a younger audience. Nowdays everything is about what do moviegoers want? They let a bunch of people See a movie then they take notes to See what makes them laugh. After that take the best parts from and try to recreate it to satisfy the audience.

1980,nem0519,Too much CGI and bad fight scenes,3,26 May 2008,"My title says it all for me. Everything went south when the jungle fight began and from that point forward I was detached from the movie. Too much George Lucas,CGI, and children driven for Indiana Jones!The only positive thing about it was the Harrison Ford, and the beginning of the movie. Harrison Ford was the classic Indiana Jones and played it to perfection as always. Other things that brought the movie down for me was that it was extremely predictable. I understand that they have beat the religious aspect of Indian Jones quest like a dead horse, but the alien deal was quite disappointing.I really think they could have introduced all of the main characters, and especially the new Mutt Jones better. The other problem with Mutt Jones is that his character was poorly developed and I really felt we did not get to know him well.I always felt that Indiana Jones was slightly more realistic as in the physics and somewhat historic part of the movie. However this one was extremely cheesy and unbelievable. I really felt I was watching a Disney movie more than anything else.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1981,ozz_soad,Dr. Jones is Back!,8,4 June 2008,"After years of talk and speculation about whether or not another entry in the Indiana Jones saga would ever be realized, it happens. To my surprise, before even seeing it myself, I heard a lot of negative comments about the film. Needless to say, I was a little worried. When I went to see it with my own eyes, my fears quickly vanished once the movie started.This is all Indiana Jones. This is what I've been waiting for. Admittedly, it is not my favorite in the series, I'd still put Raiders and Crusade ahead of it, but it's still a hell of a fun movie.The biggest complaint I hear about is the Crystal Skull and how the film explains the origin as well as the finale of it all. How exactly are the things that happen in this movie more ridiculous than an Ark shooting lightening and killing all the Nazi's surrounding it, or Thuggee's ripping hearts out of people and they still live, or the Holy Grail saving the life of Henry Jones Sr., not to mention the dozen other things that could never happen in real life? My answer to that question is - who cares? These movies are fun. I see flaws in every single one of them, this one is no different. They're all 2 hour long adventures to escape into. None of them were ever meant to be Oscar caliber films, they're supposed to reflect the cheesy matinée serials Lucas and Spielberg grew up with, this one in particular reflects that of 1950's Sci-Fi flicks. I have to say they did a fine job.And to say Indiana Jones himself lacked enthusiasm and charm found in the previous films is just plain wrong. I haven't seen Ford shine this much in 19 years. I loved every second he was on screen.As long as you're looking for a fun ride and nothing else, you'll love this movie, because let's be honest, that's all these moves are supposed to be.I for one can't wait to see it again and look forward to watching it over and over again along with the others in the series for years to come.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1982,adamcareyuk_1679,Lets get to the point!!,4,27 April 2011,"Lets set things straight, if you have ever seen an Indy film before your going to watch this regardless of any review you read. Why, because it's Indiana Jones and the something of something and it deserves to be watched due to the previous films. If you have been born under a rock and have never seen any of the previous films I suggest you start with the 1st and working your way through, the reason being is simple enough...If you have seen the previous films this WILL NOT ruin your perception of the Indiana Jones films, yes you will hate it, personally when in the cinema, my friend and I said ""if there's any bloody spaceships were going home"" we thought we got away with it when we saw the space bridge transportable type thingy whatever it was, but then noooo here comes a spaceship. This is not an Indiana film, cannot be classed as one and will never be watched with my eyes again. I really thought it was that bad.If you haven't seen them, well lets say for instance you enjoyed it...good :) go watch the other films and be even more amazed by a good good classic film and think wow, they don't make em like that anymore. But if you don't like it, give the originals a chance, if anything they deserve a watch. Any film thats tried to emulate this genre has failed miserably. It has something that most movies these days lack, everything!! I agree with a lot of what people have wrote in terms of there bad reviews so I don't need to go into most of that.I just hope that not 1 person in the world would watch the Kingdom of the Crystal (Cough) and not give the originals a bash.

1983,thaitom03-56-905229,Failed resurrection of a legend,5,18 December 2012,"This movie was not only eagerly anticipated by die-hard Indy fans, but also those who were too young to witness the theatrical debuts of the first three flicks. For almost two decades after the release of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", the intrepid archaeologist grew into a legend that was kept alive by TV screenings, DVDs and even a string of Indy-themed computer games. No wonder the audiences rushed into theaters in 2008 to see the latest installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".But what a let-down it was, what a disappointment! With such tremendous advances in movie making since ""Last Crusade"" we (rightfully!) expected nothing short of a mind-blowing, nail-biting adventure. What we were served instead was a lukewarm, pulled-by-the-hair, incoherent spectacle that mainly seemed to thrive on three things: mindless over-use of CGIs, long and boring intermissions and – aliens! Why oh why did it have to be aliens?! We could deal with divine forces locked in a mystical Biblical treasure chest, an evil Indian deity possessing people, and even a crusader knight that had been sitting it out idly in a secluded cave for a few hundred years. But aliens? Why oh why did it have to be aliens? Honestly, a vivid imagination could have come up with dozens of purposes for the title's crystal skull. Why didn't Steven Spielberg recognize how lame the alien angle would appear to even the most undiscerning viewer? I mean, the movie started out promising enough. Why were the Russians after the skull? Why did it attract metal? What was its mysterious power? But as soon as Indy escaped the nuclear test blast by locking himself in an old, lead-lined refrigerator it somehow dawned on me that we all would be pulled by the leg, foolish and all too willing enough to shell out a few bucks on watching the failed resurrection of a legend.We are then introduced to Shia LaBeouf (a miscasting, in my opinion), whose only purpose is to later turn out to be Indy's son so the title character (well played by Harrison Ford despite his age, by the way) can stumble– by pure chance, of course – into his erstwhile crush and mother of his son, Marion (Karen Allen). After a well-executed but belief-defying vehicle chase through the jungle (how did the Russians manage to get all those heavy tree-cutting machines into the middle of the rain forest?), the group of misfits is confronted by a horde of ancient, loin cloth-wearing and spear-wielding indians bursting out of temple walls, behind which they supposedly were immured for centuries. Supernatural beings they are not, though, because Indy and party mow them down like grass. We then finally learn why the crystal skull must be united with its 12 companions: so a long-buried alien spaceship can at last take off by utterly annihilating and swallowing the entire mountain-ringed valley in the process. And dumbfounded we stumbled out of the theater into the real world, asking ourselves, ""Why oh why did it have to be aliens?"" and ""Where is the next DVD rental store to pick up all three of the original Indy flicks?"" and ""Could I have spent my money for this movie ticket more wisely?""",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1984,anton-lipasti,An unnecessarily hated sequel,7,1 January 2013,"This has got to be the most underrated sequel ever. I guess the audiences today don't appreciate the tone of Indiana Jones, since this movie truly delivers the very essence of Indy. It's fast-paced, funny and has an interesting treasure for the heroes to hunt for. Sure, the story doesn't hold up as much as it could, but it's far away from the weird structure of the Temple of doom. And the goofy parts (such as the monkeys) that many have complained about are just pure Indiana Jones. And I hate Shia LaBeouf as much as anyone, but I think that he's totally tolerable here and Indy and him actually make for an amusing pair. And the thing that's been complained the most about - the aliens - really, what's the big deal? The Indiana Jones movies have always been about the supernatural objects. Be it some holy spirits, voodoo or eternal youth (not to mention the guy who was hundreds of years old), they have always served a very important part in the movies. So why the hell can't it be the extra-terrestials? They have always had a huge part in Spielberg films and adventure films in general. Why not Indiana Jones? It only makes sense. This film has the right feel to it and it does certainly not ruin the memory of Indy, it isn't even the worst one.

This movie is a combination of bad CGI and typical green screen emotion from the players.What ever happened to stunt men? Witless and flat, with no real sense of adventure or peril, Crystal Skull left me confused and borderline bitter. If i was forced to fine a bright side it would have to be Shia LaBeouf. No, plot?

I have a few choice phrases to offer up to illustrate the pile that this movie is:Atomic bomb proof refrigerator, pandimmensional beings (aliens), cheesy greaser v. jock brawl. and the pièce de résistance Shia Labeouf the Spider Monkey. There really is no reason to watch this movie and taint your opinion of Indiana Jones, unless you're watching it along with the RiffTrax or want to understand the jokes in South Park's season 12 Ep. 8 ""The China Problem"".Literally, no other reasons are sufficient.

Then, at Cuzco (Peru), they show a terrible city - again, Google Maps, folks - where La Cucaracha is being played in the background.

1988,taarva,This is an Adventure,10,16 June 2015,"One thing I do not understand. Several complaints that this movie has too much CBI. And that several of the scenes are excessive. So what ??? This is a movie. It is only to entertain. Everything mustn't be realistic all the time. And especially in the case of movies. This movie is as good as the first and I give it 10. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg should be very proud of this film.This is clearly the best Indiana Jones movie. Lots of action, humor and great story. think it's great that Marion has got a major role in this and that Shia LaBeouf has good interaction with Harrison Ford.

1989,Cattus_99,"All through the movie I kept saying ""are you kidding?""",1,25 May 2008,"I have always been a big fan of the Indy movies and I am a SciFi nut. I also read Ebert's reviews to understand his criticism and analysis. So that sets the stage.This movie is, unfortunately, dreck, ca-ca, poo, crud, call it what you will. It is an insult to the intelligence of each and every movie-goer. And for a Lucas-Spielberg movie to be so is quite beyond belief.Let me highlight the lows and then I will get into some specifics.The dialog seems little more than to act as a narration to explain what happened, what is currently happening and what will happen in the near future. It does not develop the characters or the plot.The plot is crude and unconvincing. The characters move through their lines with little humor and false emotion. Although I don't expect academy awards ranking here I do expect for than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" acting. (If you've seen this you know dreck.) The chase scenes are too long and not always relevant. There is no suspense, anxiety, or real fear displayed by the actors or felt by the audience. There were so many times in the movie that Indy should have been killed by the Russians since he had done his part, but he wasn't.There is none of the excellent humor that set a foundation for the tongue-in-cheek performances in Raiders and to a lesser extent the following two sequels.The improbability factor in much of the movie is astounding and the inclusion of useless scenes in also excessive  I will give details: Climbing into a refrigerator will not protect you from being smashed and hurled hundreds of yards or more and crashing to the ground. When it crashes at 100 miles per hours you crash as though there was no refrigerator around you since, the last time I checked, there is no padding in one of these. And let's not even discuss the heat and radiation of the blast (lead will only protect so much). Ants cannot carry whole people away into their nest, nor do they possess tablespoons of goo in their bodies.Remember those house-sized rocks revolving at great speed around the spaceship as it took off? They would not just stop and drop when the ""magnetic"" field was gone, they would fly off and destroy all around them including all the observers who were just yards away.What the hell was the purpose of the motorcycle in the airplane? How long did that last.When Mutt was looking for Indy, he seemed not to know what he looked like. Wasn't it a tremendous coincidence that he happened to first choose the right person? And that he was on that side of the train and that the train could be stopped for him to get off (not explained was that?) After the initial contact with the FBI, they disappeared from the movie. There were more Russians than FBI on American soil after that scene.Is gunpowder magnetic? I think not. If the Cadaver in the warehouse was so magnetic that it would attract the gunpowder, why wasn't all the metal in the warehouse and being carried by the troops attracted similarly. Why was it that only those metal items the camera was focusing on where attracted. In fact, later in the movie, this magnetic field could be stopped by a cloth covering  as if! An amphibious vehicle of the kind the main characters were riding in is not inherently a floating device. Like most ships, if water gets inside or they turn over (capsize) they will sink like a stone. Clearly, there were no sailors on board this cast or crew. For all the occupants to survive not one but three falls over falls the last of which looked like Niagara Falls is so comical as to be ridiculous. (btw, I know I overused that word). Why not make them a bit smaller and give the cast some trouble with the cascades so that we are anxious for their safety. When things are so absurd, the audience must suspend disbelief so greatly that at no time is it fearful for their survival.Mutt already had the skull, why did he risk death by continuing to sword fight? What's with the attacks by the natives? These occurred twice and neither was well explained, although the fear factor with them was probably the best in the movie.At the end the scene with Mac going crazy trying to gather the gold (and then dying) was so predictable, having been played out hundreds of times in other movies. Couldn't they have done something a bit different? Could Mutt really swing with the monkeys so as to catch up with speeding vehicles? Just where did he learn this skill while looking in mirrors and combing his hair? When Indy blew into the wrong end of the blowgun, the native shouldn't have died since the wrong end pierced him. In fact the wrong end isn't sharp at all or it would be impossible to discharge.Would the army place a highly secret and very important warehouse in close proximity to a nuclear test site? Not unless they wanted to destroy everything in that warehouse, which was unlikely. And while we are at it wouldn't these highly trained Russians know that a nuclear test was being conducted? Well, I have asked more questions here than can be explained in a lifetime of Indy movies. And I haven't asked them all. All I have to add is - I want my two hours back please!!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1990,kamealex,Sad about ending (No spoiler ahead!),5,27 May 2008,"It's strange. But it's been commented that the whole film has unnecessary parts with lots of CGI for an Indy adventure. It's something that frightened us since the announcement of the film and it's really true. Fortunately, there are so many action scenes where intelligent hero actions and typical adventure film lucky strikes make the film being so funny, and makes us remember the first trilogy.The film starts with a cool non-new-generation action scene. And it's so cool, seriously!! But the 2 last scenes make the film go hell.Everything is OK but the very ending of the film.

In order to prevent powerful mysterious antiquities fall into the wrong hands, two people break through many obstacles, started the most thrilling adventure journey.In fact, Indiana Jones series is the ""The Mummy"" these adventure of the ancestor, actually, we can see a lot of Indiana Jones shadow in ""The Mummy"".

1992,trottta,A movie in which Indiana Jones actually leaves his hat behind,3,5 March 2019,"Oh well, where to begin? The ludicrous CGI mole in the very start is a warning of what is yet to come.There's an emblematic scene that pretty much sums up my point: Indy causes a brawl in a cafe to escape some KGB thugs. He places his hat on some random kid's head and gets away with Mutts on a motorcyle. Yes, he LEAVES THE HAT BEHIND. Just like that. Remember he almost lost his arm for his hat in the second movie? Good thing it inexplicably shows up again, later on. You might argue that it could have been a (very slightly) different hat. Well, if you really have to make Indiana Jones lose his hat in a scene, then you better make him wear a top hat or a sombrero.Another exemple: Mutts brings his motorcycle from England to Peru, just for one scene. He arrives in front of a mental hospital, parks the bike and leaves it there. The bike never appears again. Yes, he flew to Peru, actually brought his very special motorcycle on the plane with him, and left it there, on another country.Oh, by the way, people play mexican music in Peru, in case you don't know.What I mean is, George Lucas once again managed to ruin what he built in past years, by delivering an awfully thin plot line and a very sloppy script. All plot twists are not surprising at all, you can see them all coming.You will get a few good action scenes (with not so good motivations for the bad guys) and some fan service references to the previous movies. Although if you think you'll see awesome traps and challenging puzzles, guess again.So there you have it, a terrible movie that turned to one of the easiest plot resorts: extraterrestrials. This would work just as well if it was Brendan Fraser or Nicolas Cage instead of Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I admit that some of the stunts were unbelievable(swinging in jungle, fridge escape) but just as they are done with cgi we forget that jumping out a plane in a rubber dingy can be done for real with no cgi? It was good to see Jones back and 20 years can build a lot of anticipation up and it worked for me.

1994,vdishwasherv,Shockingly Bad,4,29 May 2008,"OK so im no huge indiana jones fan but after enjoying the previous 3 movies this was a must see. You get the feeling from the opening of this movie that somehow this is going to be a huge disappointment its hard to explain, it just feels very weak and extremely lackluster but the rest of the movie follows the same pattern. I think the main problem is the story, well because there is not much of one, the movie drags along and when it really starts to drag its helped out by an action sequence. Also it gets more and more comical as it goes along, not in a good way though. At one point I thought the scary movie production team had stepped in the help out. I thought at some points I was watching an indie spoof. Harrison did his very best, shia was poor as for John Hurt such a great actor playing a character who utters about 12 words was just baffling. I found the special effects to be over the top and just plain silly. The list goes on and on really, I mean I cant believe lucas and Spielberg came together to produce such trash, by the end of he movie you just feel embarrassed for them.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1995,suckerman_see,shed a tear,4,24 May 2008,"I watched the other 3 twice each in preparation for this. Crystal Skull is so bad i'm in the depths of depression. The film plays like a Disney ride from one end to the other. Indy's resilience and everyman qualities make him a hero but it reaches absurdity in so many places. I won't add spoilers by naming specific scenes but how many brushes with death can you have before it seems A) too incredible believe and B) boring to watch? Characters in an Indy film haven't needed to be deep or explored, I mean we all know Nazis / Stalin's Commies are bad. They write themselves and just use our opinions cultivated from years of film-watching. Our baddie here was not one of our good old boo-hissable baddies. She was nothing. There are flashes of the old Indy and nods to the previous 3 but that only makes it hurt more.The dialogue is stunted and I don't know if this is due to poor writing or that the actors knew how crap this project was and couldn't put their heart into it. All but the most ardent Star Wars fan knows that Lucas is a greedy fool, making absolute sh1te of once iconic films but surely now Spielberg is emulating him (remember War Of The Worlds?).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1996,dyingstars02,Disappointing,6,22 May 2008,"I will be honest: I made the very critical mistake of walking into this movie with high expectations. And how could I not? We're talking about Indiana Jones, a series of movies that redefined the action-adventure genre for the 80s era of film. So of course I was expecting more of the same: a movie that would raise the bar and set the standard for the next generation.I won't get into the meat and potatoes of the plot except to say that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull takes place in the middle of the Cold War. The Soviets are vying for an upper hand in the conflict and, much like the Nazis of the previous films, have turned to mythical artifacts to do so. Our hero, now a war veteran and tenured professor, gets thrust in the middle of the search as he endeavors to find his fellow professor and save the day, complete with his usual gaggle of colorful sidekicks and love interest.As I said before, my expectations were high, and what I got was a huge disappointment that had me leaving the theater disenchanted with the whole franchise. I will admit, however, that there were definitely some highlights. Harrison Ford's re-emergence on celluloid complete with whip and fedora was definitely a breath of fresh air, the musical score was flawless, and nostalgia definitely made its mark throughout the entire length of the film. The banter between characters is also classic Indy, complete with humor, wit, and the frequent tip of the hat to previous films. Unfortunately,that's where the fun of the movie ends.Where the prior films focused solely on religious artifacts as the crux of the story, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull takes a slightly different approach, and the entire film is crawling with camp and ridiculousness that's over the top even for an Indy film. While there were some well-written and implemented moments that strove to redeem the film from its absurdity here and there, the second half quickly degenerated into a mess of chase scenes and action clips that had me rolling my eyes and wondering what had become of my childhood hero. What sealed the film's fate in my eyes was the climax at the end, in which Indy overlooks the lost city as, well... you'll see. By that point, the film didn't even remotely feel like it had a place in the series.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is summer popcorn fare, but no more than that. It adds nothing to a series of otherwise timeless films and, as many franchises seem to be nowadays, seems solely focused on draining our wallets of ticket prices while offering truly nothing masterful in return. I wouldn't say I regret spending the money, but this was definitely a movie best left for a rental. Rather than remember my hero battling the Reds while dodging nuclear explosions with a refrigerator and exploring other-worldly artifacts, I think I'll turn to much finer films and look on him in his prime: unearthing Arks, battling heart-stealing cultists, and discovering the secret of eternal life.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1997,Vigilant_One,absolutely hilarious,8,26 May 2008,"Despite all the negative comments and feedbacks from avid Indiana Jone's fans,I find this movie totally entertaining. the directors and producers of this movie managed to maintained the slick ,witty screenplays,trademarks moves,stunts did in the old-fashioned way. although i'm a great fan of Indiana Jones flicks,maybe i'm not too in depth of pin pointing the weaknesses and errors in this flick. prof ox was a great side character and it did add more humor to this movie.overall, this is one of d best Indiana Jones movies i've ever seen. the movie managed to keep afloat with the humor element from each character and the actors played their characters very well indeed.a light,fun movie that is not to be taken too seriously.that's what Indiana Jones movie is all about.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
1998,ewcarden,Absolute Crap,2,23 May 2008,"This movie was so absolutely ridiculous. The only thing worse than the plot for this movie was Cate Blanchett's horribly fake Russian accent. I don't know how Spielberg and Lucas could have thought this storyline was any good. This is supposed to be Indiana Jones, not E.T. They have clearly lost touch with their former abilities to make good movies. I will admit that Harrison Ford did a very good job as an old decrepit Indiana Jones, but that was the only redeeming quality of this film. Trust me, for this film, that is not enough to make it any good. The action sequences were absolutely unrealistic. While the action sequences in previous Indiana Jones movies were unbelievable and unrealistic, these were over the top. To make matters worse, far too much CGI was used.

1999,bechjo33,"I haven't been this disappointed at a theater since ... well, ever, really.",3,23 May 2008,"This is the first time, in my 5 or 6 years as an IMDb member, that I have ever drafted a review comment. The fact that I have finally done so means this was either an incredible movie, or it was extremely, inexplicably disappointing. Proceed... I almost went into this movie with high expectations. It's a good thing I didn't, because I likely would have ended up in tears, looking for anything to hang myself with as the movie struggled on in the background. I heard a few negative reviews - including a scathing one from a friend who's taste in movies I trust inherently - which luckily got me back into reality. The movie was horrible. I use ""horrible"" only because I cannot come up with a word that will truly be suitable enough. It's almost as if you have to see the movie just to understand how bad it is. I don't even know where to start. I could go through the movie chronologically, picking apart all the painful, unbelievable, gaudy, lackluster, insignificant, and otherwise insulting parts of the film, but that would take way too long. I'll just name a few, and then I will surely get frustrated and give up: First: ""Indy"" has apparently become Neo from The Matrix. By that I mean he has clearly gained the ability to dodge, or otherwise be completely unaffected by, bullets. He runs on top of boxes and beams while 20-ish Russians fire automatics at him and ultimately miss. Later in the movie, Indy jumps into 3 men with guns, somehow avoiding injury. You know how Die Hard 4 took Bruce Willis and turned him into a super hero? This film takes it the extra yard. I can already see the next movie: Indiana Jones: The Matrix, Redux.com (yes, I said "".com,"" because I bet Lucas and Spielberg would tack that on if it got them at least 1 more dollar, jackasses). Second: There are so many scenes that are completely unnecessary. For instance, we see an atomic bomb test. Indy finds a way to escape harm by cleverly hiding from the blast. But seriously, what was the point of this scene? I am assuming this is one of the Plumbbob tests that took place in 1957? George and Steven, am I right? Are you guys listening? If you are listening - you know, while I have your attention - can I have my money back? Also, are we supposed to assume that Indy will eventually die from thyroid cancer, due do his extreme exposure to radiation? And while you're at it, explain the damn gophers and monkeys, which were apparently your supporting cast throughout the film. Third: Actually, I was going to explain the horror that is the supporting cast (since the gopher/monkey comment got me thinking about it) but I won't bother. Lets just say the villains are utterly irrelevant and lack any physical presence whatsoever. They are not intimidating, they are not dark...ugh, I hate typing about this movie. Finally: (Remember, this is not really my final critique, I just got sick of critiquing) This entire movie is a never-ending string of cheesy one-liners. I turned to my friend about 1/2 way through the movie and said, ""Wow, this movie is nothing but punch lines,"" and immediately thereafter Shia Labeouf (who is completely forgettable, by the way) said, ""Well, you're going nowhere fast."" Wow, really? Shoot me in the face. The worst part of this movie: It very possibly ruined the first three movies for me. What I mean is that I don't know if I will ever be able to watch Raiders, Doom, or Crusade without inevitably thinking about this pathetic excuse for a story. What is pathetic is that even if you pretend the first three movies don't exist, this STILL fails as a fun action movie! I have never hated a director as much as I hate Spielberg right now. Spielberg, who has clearly lost his youthful imagination and is now merely following the crowd, content in knowing that if people like me are dumb enough to see his movies because of his prior accolades, he will always make money and avoid foreclosure on God-knows-how-many homes he has. One note on the CGI (because I know it's become a huge debate on this site): It DOES destroy the movie because the movie relies on it. It's as if the director, writers, and producers said, ""You know, if we have tons of CGI and special effects, we don't have to have a good story line, memorable characters, or clever dialogue."" I'm not even THAT picky. So when I see an overhead shot of a cemetery, and I can realize that I am looking at a scaled model of a graveyard (Think Beetlejuice. Yes, THAT type of scaled model), then that is a horrible graphic. I wanted to laugh at this point, but I was already far too upset with the fact that the series has been ruined. With any luck, this movie will be forgotten and we can all go back to enjoying the real Indiana Jones movies. And if IMDb has ever needed a reason to get rid of annoying users, they now have that reason. Anybody saying this is as good as ANY of the prior movies is, as Walter Sobchak would put it, out of their element. If you honestly can even compare this to the prior three movies without wanting to gauge your eyeballs out, then God forbid your inability to distinguish between art and crap. OK, I'm done. I'm so upset, and none of this has even described 1/2 my frustration.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Indy fan - but not a fan of this film. It's so sad because I was really looking forward to this. Thanks again Lucas for ruining another film. Don't worry though.

2001,mtilds-1,"poor, disappointing, sloppy",3,26 May 2008,"After watching this latest Indiana Jones film I found it very disappointing. Without giving anything away: The movie was poorly done because you can actually see where they did the green screening and blue screening to tell that it was fake background from the action scene. This really spoiled the whole thing for me cause it seem this is the cheese thing I would expect from the Univ. Studios tour, But Univ. studios has the excuse that they only have 20 min to put it together to show you how it works. The story: Really HOAKIE. Not what you would expect from the Indiana Jones story line Maybe the X files but then they are about those types of stories. Too many side kicks I really didn't see the need for so many side kicks. Where were they going with this? the story was predictable. I mean some of it was SO obvious that make me want to puke my popcorn. I did find out that they did all the filming in 79 days from an interview with Harrison Ford and he had 1 day off. Well it really shows up in this film that they rushed the whole thing and I don't see why?My advice is to wait for this movie to be on Free Cable to make it worth your while.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

2003,olyscott8,Tomb Raider meets National Treasure meets X-Files!,3,29 May 2008,"I know many like this movie and many are on on the fence. I mean no disrespect to any body with this review as we all have our own opinions and the world would be a boring placed if we all liked the same things.......But this time you're all wrong...it sucked!!! ;0) Indy movies should be in the realm of the semi-believable, and as soon as I knew we were in Area 51 looking for an alien body my heart sank! The Ark is fabulous McGuffin and the Stones in Temple of Doom where so understated they worked a treat and the Holy Grail was an inspired choice. Crystal Skulls on the other hand turned this fourth instalment into a cheap, National Treasure meets Tomb Raider meets X-Files and the whole aliens teaching the Mayan's how to plow a field plot line and draw pictures on mountains does the Mayan's an incredible injustice.Add to all this some terrible and stupidly conceived comedy moments. CGI Prarie Dogs with cartoon emotions, Mutt turning into Tarzan, CGI monkeys that are magnetically attracted to Russian baddies. The whole Atomic bomb testing and hiding in a fridge nonsense, the constant jabbering about the Skulls every 15 minutes just in case we've forgotten what this was all about. Even the action scenes felt so over-the-top with too much crammed in there just because we can in these CGI infested days. Mutt's sword fight was just laughable, as he manages to balance between two jeeps, perry and attack and get hit in the nuts by plants while travelling at 90mph. The falling down Niagra Falls there times and everyone survives and the Skull is still in one piece. Then there's the whole space ship taking off at the end? I was just clutching my head saying to myself ""Please don't let this be a big flying saucer, Please don't let this be a big flying saucer"" but alas it was! For the past few years we were told this would be a film for Indy fans, 30-40 year olds would be the people that this movie was aimed at. How could Lucas' and Spielberg's aim be as bad as the gun totting Russian's in this movie. Lucas has treaded this ground before with his abysmal attempt at reviving the Star War franchise, which he admits he wrote for himself and not the fans, and this all smacks of the same badly written, poor dialogue and non-essential craziness he had in those films. Is Spielberg responsible for the alien angle, as he does seems to have soft spot for the bug eyed other worlders? I can't put into words how disappointed I was when I left the theatre last night. I had a mix of emotions from stunned to anger. I'd love to see the rejected scripts and hope that these were as bad as the Lucas/Koepp's. After reading a few non-spoiler reviews of this movie before I saw it I was open minded and wanted to love this movie as much as I did the previous outings but as I now read more and more reviews I get the feeling there is some brainwashing going on out there. I can't believe true Indy fans would look at this film and say ""Yeah it has a real Indy feel"" because it fails almost everywhere. I say almost because I thought Mr Ford was brilliant and his age wasn't a factor or distraction at all. Shia also performed well when not swinging on vines, fencing or combing his hair. On the other hand Karen Allen felt like she'd been out of the acting loop for a while and her character wasn't in keeping with her gutsy, head strong performance as Marion in the first movie. Ray Winstone was a caricature and yeah Indy movies have these but they've been done better. Cate Blanchett's Irina Spalko was very one dimensional compared to previous villains, Belloq or Walter Donovan. There were a few glimmers of true Indy during the search for the Skull but not enough to make this a film I would happily watch again let alone multiple times.Like the new Star Wars movies this fourth Indy outing will never have room on my DVD shelf and is another poor second-cousin-twice-removed to a series of classic movies I still love to watch over and over.Lucas and Spielberg should be ashamed...very ashamed!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Does he have some kind of magic dust he sprinkles on the reel (er... DVD) after the movie is made that drains all the dialog and plot from it and replaces it with absolutely horrible CGI-induced scenes? I mean, you'd think George Lucas would've learned from the Star Wars prequels that childish humor, flashy CG, and bad writing can make the most die-hard fans loathe the franchise for the rest of their lives.It's getting to a point where I honestly think Mr. Lucas is TRYING to make bad movies so that he loses popularity and can go back to a normal life. It must've been all those years of constant Star Wars & Indy fan mail that drove him to this.Let us all hope, to some higher power, that either of these two men do NOT get their hands anywhere near The Hobbit movie.George Lucas should retire. He has far too much power in the wrong hands. I fear he may be the downfall of the movie industry if he keeps introducing Jar-Jar-like characters and corny story lines.

2006,agf119,One of the most depressing cinematic experiences of my life,2,12 June 2014,"As per the summary line... this was without a doubt the most depressing cinematic experience of my life. I am probably one of the biggest Indiana Jones fans you will ever find. After getting a perfect seat at the midnight showing, it was up to Mr. Lucas to deliver. As you probably guessed, this wasn't the case. I remember cringing minutes into the movie; that small part of me kept hoping and hoping that it was going to transform into the movie I wanted it to be. The next memory I have is walking to my car followed by several disappointed movie goers dressed as Henry Jones Sr., Sallah, etc. After six years, and as Henry Jones Sr. would put it... ""Our situation has not improved."" When this movie is on TV I convince myself that George Lucas made this movie as bad as he did because he did not want fans harassing him anymore. I pray that this is the case as no conscious human being would make a movie this bad. In summary... digging up Karen Allen from a 15 year retirement, witnessing monkeys swinging from trees and following suit, and last but certainly not least climbing into your everyday appliances to protect yourself from a nuke are cinematic ingredients for disaster. If you have yet to sit through this movie you have been warned. For true Indy fans, let's keep pretending our adventure closed in 1989...",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2007,pleiasolo,Awesome!!!!,9,25 May 2008,"I just don't get why people are trashing this film. This is Indiana Jones, and he still has it. Harrison still looks incredible. Lucas and Spielberg did not ruin the franchise. They added to it. I liked that Indy showed his age. After all, it was 1957. I liked that Indy had his limits, and he knew them.Sure, a couple of things are dumb, like Mutt playing Tarzan through the jungle, but it worked for me.It was Indy getting the mysterious clues and solving them as usual. The action was great. Yes, I would have like to have seen him use the whip more, but we must remember that he didn't use it much in ""Last Crusade"" either.This is a fun film that takes us back to the days of serial films. There is nothing wrong with this movie. Sure, it doesn't require deep thought, but it does deliver on fun and adventure. And it sure was wonderful to see Harrison back in that leather hat. Oh, and did I mention he still looks luscious???",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2008,bigmo-3,Should have left well enough alone,5,23 May 2008,"Was it the worst film ever made? No. Was it the worst of a once venerable series? Yes.I'd gone to the theater last night with school boy enthusiasm, but after the series of disappointments that made up the new Star Wars trilogy, I was also ready for a let down.The action sequences for the most part were good and captured the original spirit of the first three films. However, as soon as the world Roswell came into play, my spirits were dropped.It begs the question: Can Steven Spielberg make a movie that doesn't involve World War II or aliens? I mean, honestly. I'm sure there are those that would argue that the presence of an alien species is no more fanciful than finding the Arc of the Covenant or the Holy Grail, or that having Nazis melt on screen is on the same level as Soviet spies being sucked into an alternate plane of existence. I disagree.The use of CGI for some action sequences was also disappointing. The march of giant ants felt on the same level as the attacking scarabs from The Mummy. Having Mutt basically aided by small monkeys was also laughable and lame.There were moments throughout the film where the script became lifted and I would hope that there was a chance for my concerns to be assuaged. Then Indy was telepathically linked to an alien skull. There were also moments were the dialog was so forced and stale it was depressing.Would I want to spend money to see it in the theater again? No.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2009,joelevans84,Analysis - Pros and Cons (SPOILERS),8,23 May 2008,"I really enjoyed it! Perhaps it didn't meet every one of my expectations, but then neither did the two previous sequels to Raiders, which is still, and will always be, the king. The original is the perfect Indy adventure; the prototype and the undiluted source from which the three other films extend. Temple of Doom was too dark, Last Crusade was too light, and now Crystal Skulls is too flashy. I guess it's also too sci-fi (not for ME, mind, but probably for a lot of people).Much wailing and gnashing of teeth has followed the inclusion of aliens in the plot, and I can understand why. Again in comparison to the previous flicks it seems a rather wild departure from Doctor Jones' bread and butter. But when you consider the context it does kinda make sense. I admit that UFOs in an Indiana Jones movie is a bit confronting, but when you think about it, it's an unexpected and unique twist that does help keep the old McGruffin fresh.We've all gotta cut the grand giants of movie legend some slack and bring our expectations to a more reasonable level. Not in the dirt, but perhaps just a little lower than the stratosphere. I know it's not easy, not with all the years and history and hype, but maybe just try to go into these things with less rigidity and more of an open mind. I endeavoured to do so with this movie and had a ball. I will do the same with the upcoming Star Trek reboot.Older Indy isn't the same as the old Indy, but he's still Indy, and I'll definitely be going to the cinema a second time.Because you know... when the old movies came out I was just too damn young.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Glad I did not pay to see this rubbish.The movie has no plot, storyline... nothingI can't believe Ford accepted the script... that guy is amazing, I can't understand why on earth he accepted to join this mess. All the other Indiana movies were amazing, but people watching this last one, will probably remember the whole saga as a complete disappointment.No more Lucas or Spielberg, it is time for new people to come in and do proper movies again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Perhaps many people thinks atomic bomb was worked for the World War II. But I don't think so. It was just a mass murder and a human subject use in Japan. The atomic bomb killed just the ordinary people... old people, students, women and kids, not troops. I mean it was really sad and terrible tragedy. Just a overkill and genocide.I love Indy movies.

2012,jonnormand,Meh,6,28 May 2008,"OK lets get this out the way right off the bat. Too many ""professional' reviews I see critique a movie based purely on its artistic merits. The problem is movies can not be grouped into one single genre. Some movies are designed to be artistic from a visual, audio, and plot standpoint. Some movies are designed to make you think  ponder the point of the movie and even make you go out and take about the movie with others. Then there are movies that are designed for a big tub of popcorn: the summer blockbuster. The purebred entertainment movie. Sadly KOTCS falls much closer to movies like Armageddon, The Rock, Transformers, etc then the Gold Standard that is Raiders of the Lost Ark. Don't get me wrong. Its better then those movies but its much closer to them then the original. My measurement would be if Raiders was on one end of the spectrum as really good, Last Crusade is halfway between Raiders and Armageddon, The Rock, Transformers. KOTCS would fall smack in between Last Crusade and those other summer blockbusters. Again not bad but nothing that will stand out 10 years down the road. If the point of a summer blockbuster was to entertain, KOTCS did succeed in that. However there was one jarring aspect of the movie that threw it off balance about 10 minutes into the film. What I'm about to say will not give anything away. Because unless you are as dense as a neutron star you get where the movie is going, again, 10 minutes in. This is Indiana Jones with aliens. Let that sink in a few seconds. . .Yes. Indiana with aliens. Now our culture has lived with 3 Indiana Jones movies since 1981. They have dealt with mysticism, the paranormal, God, faith, and a whole host of other topics. We know what Indiana is. What he deals with. Throwing aliens into the mix is like having a Harry Potter movie based in New York where he works at Mcdonalds with Jay and Silent Bob. Different yes, but there is that WTF surreal moment when you think this doesn't fit the profile of the character or his world. It's a tetris piece that does not fit. . .at all. Speaking of tetris. One other aspect that did distract was the reuse of tried and true scenes. We all know them, and you will too when you see the movie. Lucas simply opened up the Indiana Jones plot action devices bag, poured them onto the table, picked up a few, blew the dust off them and plugged them into the story. In a few cases he twisted then turned the device around to make it slightly different then the original use but its there. Heck, see if you can spot the big rolling ball plot device in the movie. Different but there. Now on one hand this could be seen as an homage to its predecessors, which I'm perfectly fine with. However some of them are so obvious as to distract from the movie. At one point there was definitely a ""Oh come on"" moment for me. Homage's are a fine thing, when not overdone. KOTCS overdid it, and then some.What Lucas DID get right was to go Central\South American in terms of the culture used. I grew up with the animated series The Mysterious Cities of Gold. The series made me really read up on the Mayans, the Aztec, the Incans, the Olmec , etc. These civilizations were rich, savage, and surprisingly technologically advanced. They also were mysterious. For a long time the theory of alien support has been thrown out there. Unfortunately Lucas ran with the idea, which again does not fit in the Indiana Jones ""universe"". Again the movie was entertaining which at the end of the day is what is most important. So on a scale of 1-10 I'm going to give KotCS a 6. It's a meh movie. Not bad. Not great. Just meh.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2013,JLDFilms,Ignore Everyone's WORTHLESS Hate Comments/Reviews.,10,24 May 2008,"This film is excellent. The only reason everyone hated it was because of Aliens and CGI, which is really pathetic if you ask me. If you can overlook Aliens and CGI, then maybe you'll enjoy it more, but I doubt it because everyone's ignorant. I'm sick of everyone saying that Lucas ruined your childhood. It's a movie for God's sake! Your parents dying a horrible death while your five years old is something that would have ruined your childhood. Having to live with a step family that beat you to death every night would have ruined your childhood. Getting sexually abused by your drunk parents would have ruined your childhood.

2014,garagestunt6,A good soild adventure film,7,9 June 2008,"Warning major spiolers: A lot of people give this movie a hard time because of the legend Indiana jones four has built up over the last 20 years. I have just seen the movie a second time (having seen it the first time 2 weeks ago). Now indy is my idol and the reason why I'm a writer and I have to say that a lot of the things that buged me about this film the first time didn't bug me the second time. As a matter of fact the film does have a great start and a great middle while the third Act does wane a bit. I'm made my piece with the Alien plot line and figured that it actually makes sense, this is susposed to be a really great TV show (since indy is based off of serials from the 30's) bringing aliens into the picture isn't that bad of an idea. Ford settles back into the closet nicely and the CGI does not take over the film and there are a lot of soild set pieces. However Marion Ravenwood feels like she in the way, there is one joke too many, and I could care less that Mutt WIlliams is Indy Son. Those problems aside this is a good adventure film and I enjoyed it much more the second time around. No this isn't the best indy film or even the second best, it does compair to Temple of Doom which was the worst film in the series while still being a cool movie (kind of like Jedi). Kingdom of the Crystal skulls might be the new holding of that trophy, it might be the weakest of the series but it remains a cool film none the less and maybe it's best selling point is the fact that it still feels like a good old fashion jones picture.7 out of ten",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2015,briansallot70,Not the worst and not the best,6,25 May 2008,"I went into this film to see an Indiana Jones film and to be honest that is what I got.I think a lot of people who have reviewed this film so badly is because of the action sequences in other films being so fast with quick cuts and unbelievable human abilities portrayed by the characters. This all started with Matrix (which is a very good film) but since then so many films use that style(even though The Matrix is based in a virtual world).Indiana Jones action is slower not as quickly edited and without slow motion added to every other punch. I found the film rather refreshing, a return to old school film making.I will be honest and admit that the Alien plot seems very out of place for an Indy film and that I would agree with other posters.Harrison Ford was fantastic as always, Shia was good in his role and even Karen Allen did a great job with what time she had on the screen.I rate this film above Temple of Doom but below Raiders and Last Crusade.

2016,AR5,Thanks for nothing...,1,23 May 2008,"This movie turned out to be just as I predicted, just another example of modern Hollywood's thinking (if you want to call it that) that it is necessary to replace plot with unbelievable special effects or events.I'm a huge fan of Harrison Ford, and I can't for the life of me figure out why he'd want to be part of something that ruins one of the best movie franchises. To me, this is worse than what Star Wars Episode 1 did to the Star Wars franchise. I knew this was probably the way it was going to be, but I had to see it on the big screen, just in case.There is no excuse for this kind of movie making! Stop giving Hollywood breaks, and making excuses, we should hold them to higher standards and show it with our pocket books.Here's a note to Lucas and Spielberg, you should have the cg effects out and made the movie like you did the first 3, that way, you'd have less of a chance of screwing up the movie.I have nothing positive to say about this ""movie"".

2017,bitskob,Extremely Disappointed,5,24 May 2008,"It was a decent, mediocre movie. Shia LaBeouf was by far the worst sidekick/partner (Sallah, Short Round, Indy's Dad, Marcus Brody) in the series. He could have been completely removed from the movie and it wouldn't have suffered at all because he added nothing; no humor, no emotion, just a few lame stunts and fights. Cate Blanchett's character was not intimidating nor a bad guy that one can love to hate, just a very bland antagonist. Harrison Ford was solid, but couldn't carry the weak plot and weak cast. Of all of the recent continuations of old franchises such as Rambo, this was by far the weakest offering I have seen.In essence, save this one for the rental pile.***SPOILERS BELOW*** The film starts out with a promise as they begin with a visit to the warehouse which we last saw as the Government's holding spot for the Ark, however it goes downhill from there. We learn that the premise of the movie is starts with Area 51/Roswell new Mexico and just takes on an alien quest. While the other films involved the powers of God and black magic, presenting aliens into the series just strayed too far from the original concepts.The thousands of year old warriors crawling out of the walls and then being easily struck down by gunfire was laughable. John hurt played a brilliant mind reduced to a simpleton by the skull, and the ending was similar to Lost Ark in that the bad guys where done in by their own arrogance and are turned to dust, only it was far less appealing than the power of God destroying evil. John Hurt's insight into the alien vanishing is that they went to the ""space between spaces"" which is meaningless drivel not insight. After that, Marion and Indy get married. It's a nice way to bring the series full circle and to a close.In the end, I want my $8.00 backs.

2021,Kosmicfreak,My least favorite Indiana Jones Film (May contain a spoiler),6,23 May 2008,"It's not a horrible film, but I didn't like it. The plot is a little too thin for me, and the explanation sequences really bothered me a lot. For the first Indy films, when Harrison Ford explained something, he only explained it once. In Raiders he explained what the Ark was, and really not too much else. In this movie, there is a least five of those sequences, and after two, I was a bit sick of them. I do agree with several of the other reviewers on here about Spielberg CGI statements, because there is far too much of it, and it's blatantly obvious. This definitely didn't allow me to enjoy the action sequences as much, for two reasons. One, is that several of the action sequences are in fact way too ridiculous and adding CGI to those sequences, definitely doesn't help. The other is the fact that no person could accomplish some of those scenes. I mean that's what I love about real Stuntmen, someone had to do it, so it had to of happened somehow. Anyhow, the plot wasn't amazing, and with 19 years in the works, that should have been good. Lucas has never been that great with dialogue, but after nineteen years, it should have been better. I didn't really like Karen Allen's performance, and her character in this movie is really only in it, because she was in Raiders. There is no really good reason why she is back, accept that Lucas thought, hey we should bring someone besides Harrison Ford back. The fact that Indiana Jones was almost a god in his inability to get injured and kick people's asses at retirement age, didn't really help. He never once was injured for more than like 2 seconds, even in Raiders he bled and was getting beaten up constantly and just used his ingenuity to win his battles. Now apparently at 60+ he's in better shape then ever before. See it if you want, don't expect it to be great, and I honestly wouldn't recommend seeing it in theaters. It's just not worth the money, unless the only reason you are spending it, is to see an Indy movie on the big screen. But personally, I'd rather find someone with a projector and watch any of the other ones, even if I had to pay 10 bucks.-KosmicFreak Quoting my friend on this one.While discussing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull -Hey what was your favorite part of the movie? -The Dark Knight Trailer",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Enter Mutt Williams, he shows up on his bike doing his best Brando impersonation and tells Indy that his old friend and colleague has disappeared while looking for an ancient treasure, but.. he did leave a letter passed onto him through Mutt's mom Mary. After some swift action Indy has no choice but to help his old friend out and try clear his name at the same time, along with Mutt they head to the Jungle in search of some answers. The Skull itself is some what the McGuffin, the context in which it is found is very intriguing and the characters they encounter along the way are strange and dangerous giving Indy and his side-kick Mutt a good opportunity to show us what they are made of. The Russians are popping up every stop of the way and it seems they both have a common goal, to return the Skull to its place of origin and obtain the power that the legend tells of, the Russians want it to rule the world, Indy wants it in the name of History.The Highlights are defiantly the action sequences, CGI is defiantly its basis but its still great fun and the scope is arguable bigger than any of the Indy films before.

I have always wanted an Indiana Jones sequel, and I consider myself a huge Indy fan, fan not fanatic, and it wasn't until 2000 when I discovered IMDb and learned that a sequel was a real possibility. For the last 8 years I have been logging on to and becoming a member of this site as well as the raider.net and of course IMDb in search of knowledge about the movie's production. Everyday logging on to see what was new, first the script was going to be done by M. Night Shamylan, then by Jeff Nathanson, the by Frank Something and they were all rejected, then they got the script but Spielberg was busy, then Lucas was busy, then......... on and on and on for eight... long... years. For myself and many of us, this wasn't just a movie, but a journey, of the possibility for talented individuals to come together as a collective and make a great film. But over time it seems people lose touch and now on to my review.....The beginning was great, I actually got goosebumps and somewhat teary eyed, the action sequence was superb, great shots of the stunts as well as what I felt was great movement by Harrison Ford to show the audience that he can still move around like a young man, something as simple as climbing up and down boxes like that has to be a mission for most 65 year old. !!!SPOILER!!! When they find the box and open it up kind of killed it for me because I really did not want an alien theme, but it was kind of cool how realistic it looked.!!!SPOILER!!! After that though I kind of forgot about this theme and focused on the film, it made me sad when they described what Indy has been up to for the last 19 years, made me real angry thinking they had all these great stories they could have used and made some great films with and it really aggravated me thinking how many Indy adventures we had missed!!!The movie moves along well the scenes at the school were cool, it was just like Raiders and (Third?? to) Last Crusade minus Marcus Brody. I really did enjoy the humor and the scenes, We meet Mutt, I was never a fan of Lebeef joining the cast but like many others I had learned to live with it.We go to Peru, great scenes, funny dialog, good times, made it worth the waitTHEN IT WENT ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH SPOILERFirst of all I didn't even want that kid in the movie and as I spent almost 10 months trying to accept the stupid kid then they go and make him his SON Get the hell outer here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Karen Allen fine great idea, Mutt being HER kid, fine I can live with that, but being his SON!!! ABSOLUTELY NOT! SPOILER FINISHEDThe subsequent action sequence made me somewhat consider and forget the above, but not really, not even close to Raiders counterpart, Indy under the truck scene, Temples mine cart, and Crusades Tank scene. NOT EVEN CLOSE. I felt that in the whole movie that was the scene that was missing, the kind of action scene where you go WOW, that was realistic AND Absolutely INCREDIBLE.Then they go and kill it AGAIN SPOILER BEGINS:Extra Terrestrials!!!!! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!!! My Heart dropped down to China and I consider it the one of the worst moments of my life! After 8 excruciating years they go an put the two things I literally PRAYED for in the Movie was one of the most disappointing moments of my life!!! SPOILER ENDSIm not trying to knock the movie, since I was 2 years old when Crusade came out in 89' I HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH FUN AT THE MOVIES LIKE I DID FOR THIS ONE, but I have to be honest I didn't like those two themes. To me this movie will have to be an acquired taste that I have yet to acquire. I am going to go see it more times and enjoy the ride. It really was one of the FUNNEST TIMES AT THE MOVIES, and I recommend that you go see it but for my long journey I feel they could have done better and hopefully I will learn to love it, Do I want 5 to happen?? HELL FREAKIN YEAH if only so that they can redeem themselves.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2026,siliconfiles,"Shia sucks, Ford's too old, and the villains are unscarry",1,4 November 2010,"I'll start right off by saying, and I think I speak for the majority here (keyword: majority), please do not under any circumstances cast Shia LaBeouf. This is becoming irritable to watch; such a third rate actor being cast in first rate roles.. and it has been discussed over and over again. Please, if anyone can relay this who may be, by the string of everyone's luck, a friend of George Lucas... to hint a tiny bit at the casting, and to remind him never to submerge Indy into a painful science-fiction film with cameos from The Fourth Kind, flying refrigerators, and Tarzan's friends; all can be great for Indy's future.I have one of the best suggestions for casting someone to keep the legend going. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who is a true Indiana Jones fan owes it to themselves to look up Anthony Ingruber (link here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bba_wPdLxp4). If you are a true fan, you really need to watch this quick clip and you will know who can continue as the real, true son of Ford's character.If you saw the link, I think the question has been answered. This kid looks more like Ford than River Phoenix, not to mention LaBeouf who is as believable playing Indy's son as Jaden Smith would be (Will Smith's son). Let's be real and stop allowing this travesty being committed to one of America's greatest film heroes and archaeologist. We need to cast Anthony Ingruber alongside Ford, and the greatest part is Ford does not have to be part of the entire film since Mr. Ingruber would make any true fan believe we are witnessing a younger Ford. This is how much the kid looks like Ford. It's uncanny.We all know Indiana Jones 4 is one of the greatest smears on the trilogy, and thanks to LaBeouf, swinging monkeys, flying fridge's and the UFO's, we can thank George for really creating the cheapest continuation anyone could only fathom in a nightmare (with his kind of money, talent, and cast... and this is what we got??) Well, I think I said enough. I'd like to know what everyone thinks of my choice for Indy's son.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

OK, so I watched for the simple entertainment value.Stunts/action --- most good, but others: the audience reaction of ""yeah, right"" or ""come on"" says it all. and others still...... were Spielberg and Bruckheimer having regular meetings and comparing notes?

2029,moontabin,Was not worth the popcorn or ticket price.,2,25 May 2008,"I went into this movie with high expectations. Harrison Ford generally doesn't let me down. But lets face it, he had the good times and they are gone. In this installment of Indiana Jones, we discover that 20 years have pasted and Indy is abducted by.... no not Nazis,.. Russians and taken to Area 51 which is apparently run by incompetent idiots. In the end, we are supposed to believe that Indy can still use his whip to swing and try to land on a car and fall back to another vehicle instead and not break his hip. That is in the first few minutes. Then it gets a little more toony when he survives a nuclear test bomb in a lead filled refrigerator as it is hurled miles away by the impact of the blast. Next time I find myself in a nuclear blast I guess I know how to survive. The movie wasn't all bad, the banter with the angsty rebel Mutt was sometimes funny, but in the end I go to see an Indy film to see Indiana Jones take the Nazis and spank them. Not to see an alien crystal skull that looks like complete garbage and watch a bunch of special effects and things that could never ever happen in any reality being done, unless it is in a movie like Forbidden Kingdom. I remember a time when people used to do this crazy job call stuntman where you actually did some stunts and made things look real. I love Harrison Ford, I love Indiana Jones but this movie was not worth watching at all.

To me, the movie just a try-hard. You could just see the amount of effort George Lucas had to rake his brain to make up a reasonable story line, which to me was over the top.In my Opion, the movie's loss was due to time. I mean the last movie was made 19 years ago. You can't just bring someone out of a 19 year coma and expect them to function properly.Never the less, the movie kept you hooked. I went to see the movie with friends who hadn't seen the 3 before and they loved it, but as being an Idiana fan i felt quite disappointed with the results.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Would I still watch it? YES!!! Why? First of all, Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones. Second of all, Steven Spielberg directed it. And lastly, an old flame is back! Hello to Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Black :) And there is the snake... An Indy movie would not be complete without one.All in all. Great story and entertaining screenplay. Satisfying opening sequence where Indy makes his escape from Russians led by Irina Spalko (played by Cate Blanchett who can take on any role she wants and successfully gets away with it)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

This movie follows in the same tone. The first half is definitely the best half but the whole ride is a fun one.There isn't really a feeling of suspense and you have to forgive the movie for this, as well as some of the unrealistic chase scenes. The dialogue is great and so is Harrison Ford.I just got out of the midnight showing and I'm going again tomorrow!

2033,rob_elmhirst,An absolute stale mess!!!!,5,27 May 2008,"There is one moment I'd like to draw attention to that sums up this entire experience for me: In the jungle chase sequence when Spalko and the Indy clan clash 'duck' vehicles there is a moment when Spalko gets molested by an army of monkeys. After a brief but notable tussle with one particular hairy simian she throws it from the vehicle. All focus instantly pulls away from the main action of the characters to hang it's suspense of whether the poor, mishandled monkey falls to its death or not, which I can tell you disappointedly after an elaborate and pointless display of cartoonish acrobatics doesn't. Memo to audience: please retain one boo-hiss from the Cate Blachett Russian meanie, the chimp from the Golden compass did survive.Now I'm an animal lover as much as anyone but in quick flashback to Raiders, you have the cutest little monkey on the planet - nazi salute and all- who helps in the capture of marian (bad monkey), but grieves with indy at her loss (reformed good monkey), killed off to the immortal words of ""bad dates"". It's classic.My point is Spielberg used to have some balls. He knew how to play with his audience to keep em on the edge of their seats. That monkey in crystal skull was never gona die, you knew it before she threw it and all in the name of family entertainment I'd like to ponder? Lucas film wouldn't want kids crying home to their parents about a fallen monkey. Hell, blow-torched nazi faces and torsos bitten in two by giant sharks was fine with a ' PG' Spielberg back in the 70s / 80's. If your gona pull away from the main action it has to be for a dam good reason- if the monkey had died it would have at least added incentive to cheer for Indy against Spalko but what was the point other than to showcase ILM????I don't lay the main blame squarely at the limp directorial abilities of Spielberg or Lucas. These two creative forces in Hollywood have always, always been at there very best when they've restrained from painting you the full picture in a scene. With the mantle CGI brings of anything and everything is possible I believe all the magic is destroyed when I see films like crystal skull. Some genius at ILM must have thought hey we can make the monkey grab the branch to save it's life just before it falls, lets do that cause it will look good. With the montra of 'lets do it cause we can' you see what a cancer CGI really is to mainstream cinema.....OK (deep breath) let's go for it then- exhibit A: a 65 year old man scrabbles into a lead lined fridge- get blasted into orbit, returns to earth and just steps out of the dented,destroyed casing unscratched to have greetings and salutations with gordon the gofer!! It's ridiculous. In Temple of Doom Indy falls 300 ft out of a plane with a rubber dingy, then propels over a 1000 ft cliff and then has a water rapids adventure all in quick succession. The likelihood is that the man would have died many times over with a carcass left unfit for picky vultures but dam it I'm more than willing to suspend disbelief in the name of entertainment and say the dingy cushioned the blows here, forward on to 2008 and come on people, come on!!!!! The most disappointing thing is not that it all looks so fake (though admittedly that is still a major problem) it's the fact that it's all used so illogically. A lad swinging through the jungle with a tribe of ginger monkeys (Have I mentioned I loved the monkeys) to guide him is if anything else seriously out of tone with the rest of the movie. I'm sure kids loved it the same as they probably love the star wars prequels (quick shudder) but the whole dam point of doing another film should have been to meet the lines of the original fans, same with star wars. Cashing in with a new generation to sell a few extra lego sets is a sell out.A long time ago two men with beards made mainstream cinema intelligent, imaginative, entertaining, passionate and daring. This film represents the coffin nail for everything Hollywood cinema stands for today. Shame.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2034,jgiannantoni05,Ultimately unnecessary. Distant fourth. Frustrating.,3,24 May 2008,"Here is the tale of the tape on Indy 4: Positives: 1. Fine or sufficient acting from all actors. No one turned in a notably poor performance in terms of acting (IMHO). Kinda surprised me.2. Pretty good action scenes. But see below.3. Nice 1957 elements thrown in. I was feeling 1957.4. Competent directing from Spielberg. Though Spielberg is not off the hook completely I suppose.5. Nice nods to the old movies and even Young Indy Chronicles.Negatives: 1. The script. Oozed of George Lucas's poor touch (despite Koepp). Painful exposition, etc. The script is what really keeps this movie from being not seen as unnecessary. So frustrating because the movie has the raw elements for a movie much closer in quality to Last Crusade and Temple. Instead, there is chasm b/w Last Crusade/Temple and Crystal Skull. Just like Die Hard 4 pretty much.2. Too much CGI. What is Lucas's major malfunction with CGI? These Indy movies stem from adventure serials, so why inundate the viewer with so much modern CGI? It hurts the suspense, hurts the serial-feel...it just pushes me out of the film. The jungle chase was really hampered by the CGI. I actually liked some of the earlier action scenes more.3. Too much unrealism (similar to #2). CGI monkey's attacking Soviets in a moving jeep? Surviving a nuclear explosion while flying in a refrigerator that conveniently lands right at the edge of the explosion? Etc. Some parts of the chase sequences really stretched things also. I'm tolerant of much unrealism in the Indy films, but even this movie takes me to my hard-to-reach limit. I liked the giant ants though for some reason.4. Soviets not threatening enough. How many times did Jones & crew escape from the Soviets? How stupid were the Soviets' tracking abilities? I liked Spalko a tiny bit more than I thought I would. But overall, the Soviets were too incompetent, too pushover, too lenient.5. Ending insufficient. I was confused and unmoved by the ending. Lacked suspense. Just anti-climatic.6. Indy too much a softy. I'm fine with Indy toning down his edginess some. But Indy wasn't written any edginess. He felt too much like Mr. Rogers.7. Too many characters, thus characters undeveloped. Marion, Mutt, McHale and Oxley just undeveloped. And Spalko.Overall: Ultimately unnecessary. Distant fourth. Sadly frustrating b/c could have been a closer fourth if not for what appears to be George Lucas's influence. Ford could have ended his career with a higher quality film, and that's sad to me. The SW prequel Lucas is the culprit here once again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2035,mcvermunt,Indy is back - or is he?,4,19 May 2008,"When I received word that a fourth Indiana Jones movie was in the making, I couldn't be more thrilled. Highly anticipating the film, I felt extremely fortunate being invited to go see the premiere.The very first few seconds of the film made my toes curl in my shoes. What's this? I couldn't believe it, I frowned and wondered why Steven Spielberg chose particularly this to kick it off. Oh well, fortunately the scene continued and came down to business after only a few minutes. So my hopes were up again, I was getting ready for it to really begin and then... I got disappointed again.As the first act evolved, continuity flaws appeared so much in my face that they really started annoying me and put a real pressure on the entertainment level which the scenes so eagerly tries to bring across. And so, really, the entire movie continues. The makers try so hard to be entertaining in any way, that the efforts simply become too obvious and then cause a contrary effect. Some wits and jokes are really good and even reach the level of the other Indy movies, but far too often -especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie- they are simply too easy and they made me feel kind of stupid watching them.Then when the action rolls out, Spielberg shifts to a higher gear. Hopes are up again, you feel like now you'll get to what you came for. Alas, this action element is not satisfying either. For the same reason as the humour: there is too much 'trying' to give the audience its action scenes, and so it goes completely over the top. With as ultimate climax the big finale. It is just embarrassing.The positive points are that scenes are shot with clear craftsmanship and the acting is OK considering the storyline, however both can really not save this movie from making you feel conned when you walk out.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2036,vox_voy,"Indiana Jones - Nowhere near the best, but still a fun movie",5,25 May 2008,"***I have tried to keep this review clean of spoilers, but I have marked it for spoilers just in case.*** First off: the next person who refers to this film as ""corny"" or ""campy"" in a negative sense gets an Indy punch to the face. I'm tired of hearing people say that...apparently they either haven't seen the originals or don't remember them because I distinctly remember those being corny too (and I watch them...all the time even now.) The good news is that it didn't suck! Everything after the first (horrible) 10 minutes or so is awesome, all the way to the end excluding a certain portion at the end that people who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about. There was that certain aspect of the plot line that was completely and utterly ludicrous - not because it was bad per se, but because it was a bit awkward and did not cleanly fit into the movie. You also have to take into consideration that it has been a very long time since the last Jones movie was made, both Spielberg and Lucas have changed a lot for better, or for worse (for horribly worse in Lucas's case) so it's not going be completely ""just like old times."" They don't do things the same as they did years ago so it's going to be a little different. But not in a bad way if you don't view it as a bad way.KotCS was like a puzzle: You always get off to a rocky start, but after that you just know how it's going to fit together and it's wonderful but once you hit the end, there's a single piece missing. This piece is that awkward part of the plot line - instead of leaving that piece missing it was like they took a piece from a totally different puzzle and then just took a hammer and forced it into place. It was awkward, strange, and hurt the movie more than helped. I am also convinced that most of this idea for that aspect of the plot was dreamed up by a certain George Lucas seeing as all of his recent stuff is awkward and unwieldy and doesn't quite fit together.I'd say that this is definitely the weakest Jones movie but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's not like the Episodes versus the Original Trilogy, it's just a bit weaker as a film. I don't even really consider this a fourth movie in the trilogy - you shouldn't either. Consider it as an off-shoot, not an actual part of the series because it is too different to be.Harrison Ford was wonderful, it was just like he was back into the old movies and I loved his interaction with Shia LaBeouf who was just awesome and adorable as Mutt. It was sheer delight when Karen Allen showed up midway through the film, only to start bickering with Indiana just like old times. The interaction between Ford, Allen, and LaBeouf were incredibly enjoyable as well.I do wish the whip were there more than like, once, and the CGI had been left completely out. Prairie dogs? The sequence at the end? No thanks. And that scene in the beginning with the fridge made me want to punch myself in the stomach. Thank god Neil Flynn showed up in some huge horn-rims as an FBI agent to make me feel better after that horror of a random script addition. I also wish some of the characters got a little more fleshed out. They make sideways remarks about Indy's past several times, yet never delve into them. Mutt has a few good scenes dealing with his affection and worry for Ox and his mother, but not really...and after that scene where semi-catatonic Ox ignores him and upsets him, he largely seems to pretend Ox doesn't exist for the rest of the film, even when he ""wakes up."" Overall I liked it, I'd give it 3 out of 5 which is probably .5 points lower than what I consider Temple of Doom.DO see it, but DO NOT expect another Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Heck, don't even expect Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which was formerly the weakest of the series.Just go in, have fun, and relive the nostalgia.Also...Harrison Ford is still incredibly attractive, IMHO. I've literally had a crush on him since I was old enough to like the opposite sex and even before that adored him. I'm not about to stop now no matter how old he is.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

It almost seems like Indy meets E.T. meet 3rd Encounters meet Mummy.At least one thing you expect from Lucas/Spielberg was good CGI but that was also below par (I guess to look like the previous 3 movies).Thank goodness Lucas used the latest tech in Star Wars Prequels.You have to watch it because it is an Indy movie but do not go with high hopes.

Good old Harrison definitely still has what it takes, hell, by the look of it he could keep on going for another 20 years!

2041,trevt24,"Harrison is still Indy, the rest, not so much.",5,22 May 2014,"Well, like a lot of the other reviewers on here, I grew up a huge Indiana Jones fan, so the idea that he was coming back to the big screen was exciting. But I feel let down. In the 'making of crystal skull' documentary, Spielberg and Lucas talk a great deal about bringing back the original look and feel of the movie, but I couldn't tell from watching it. Way too much CGI, especially considering how Spielberg took pride in the authenticity of Raiders during the 'making of' documentary, where almost everything had been done in real life with very limited special effects, now we have what appears to be the vast majority of crystal skull in some kind of cgi. Even the beginning scene where in every movie they've transformed the paramount mountain into some kind of mountain scene, in raiders it was a great looking, mysterious mountain in the jungle, now we have a cgi gopher mound with cgi gophers. That right there could pretty much sum up the difference between the first and the last movie. It really just didn't seem like Spielberg and Lucas even tried in this one. In certain instances, it felt more like an Indiana Jones parody than an actual Indiana jones film. Harrison Ford did a surprisingly good job of transitioning Indy into an older Indy, which I thought would be more weird than it was. There was still scenes where, more due to the writing maybe, he fell out of character, and turned into some kind of cautious indy, or where, during the quicksand scene, he forgets about the danger of the situation and has a teaching moment with Mutt about the differences between wet quick sand and dry quick sand. With Marion, I really liked seeing her back in the indy films, I just wish it would have been more believable. Just watching how she performed in Raiders, and then watching this one, and it's a night and day difference in regards to how believable her lines were and the situations she was in were. The driving off a cliff onto a tree that very magically bends just right to set them nicely down into the water, all the while having a 'told you so' smile on her face was probably the worst. You didn't see anything that comical come out of her in Raiders. Shia was decent as mutt, I really don't have much to complain about there other than some of the ridiculous scenes he had to act through (swinging CGI monkeys that for some reason attack the bad guys and the sword fight while straddling two cars scene) Last but not least is the ALIENS. oh wait, INTERDIMENSIONALS that look just like ALIENS. The movies have done a great job of using religious/paranormal type McGuffins without going over the top. Science Fiction does not belong in these movies. Trying to turn a 1930's serial adventure flick into a 1950's B movie was a terrible idea. Just because it was based in the 50's doesn't mean you change the whole formula to the movie. It was still fun to see Indiana Jones back in action again, and there were some good scenes in it that make it worth watching at least once. but overall, waaay too much CGI, over the top action scenes that are way too unbelievable, and way way WAAAY too much aliens.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2042,pliga,Indiana Jones and the Cash Grabber,2,22 May 2014,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, released in 2008, is a follow up to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, taking place 19 years after it (even though Indiana Jones looked like it was 40 years). The movie continues the adventures of Indiana Jones, using the same formula as the others: Indiana is racing against Russians or Nazis to get some mystic artifact, teaming up with a woman from his past, only this time, the artifact is a forgotten alien city that was poorly explained to the audience and that creates a all confusing plot.The Indiana Jones saga was beautifully closed 25 years ago with The Last Crusade. However, for some reason, probably financial, the producers decided to make another one. The movie started going downhill when they casted 70-year-old Harrison Ford to play Indiana, a character who is always running and jumping. Second of all, the premise that there is a ancient alien city with infinite knowledge is not convincing, also because it was not well explained. I watched the movie lots of times and the definition of the city is still a little bit of a blur to me.All in all, what I am trying to say is that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was an unnecessary addition to the great trilogy that were the first three Indiana Jones, as it was based on a flawed premise and the plot was poorly developed. The movie is just a cash-grabber.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

He also used a line from ""The Last Crusade"" trying to create a ""Star Trek""(speaking of plagiarizing Paramount) moment & it fell flat as Kansas. It's high school drama (I did like ""The Beaver"" from ""Chronicles of Narnia"" showing up though). It's not an issue of struggling for a quality plot, Harrison Ford was ""out of whack"" with the universe (""That wasn't our Captain Kirk that beamed up, Mr. Scott. I have no idea who that is.""). None of this necessarily ""sunk"" the movie completely. It's enjoyable & a quality work in spite of it all as far as general action/adventure. It doesn't have to be a work of genius. I'm suspecting a Russian influence in this possibly though (We liked the line from ""Hunt For Red October"". Sounded cool. It's ""heavy"". Makes us look deep. Watch more of it), but I'm wondering if you're grasping for something at a sub-conscious level thinking that it looks like ""nouveau"" art or it's an agenda that you believe is ingenious & impossible to out- maneuver and you're only making asses of yourselves. Let's see here: ""You plagiarized, Paramount. (""No we didn't. 'Hunt for Red October' is a Paramount production. Nyah, nyah).""Curses, foiled again by Hollywood's wizkids. Teach us uppity riff-raff to take ya on, um, but, uh...speaking of agendae. Was it something deeper, Captain?""A Craig Ferguson moment: ""Look, if we want to plagiarize from our own stuff, we'll jolly well do it!""""Um, yes, but you're missing the bloomin' point, Stephen""Okay, without being mysterious (Interview): Stephen, it's a major f*ckup in the movie. Obviously, audiences forgave it & wouldn't comment. That's more being courteous over a weird faux pas & going ""whatever"". ""Hunt for Red October"" was 17 years old. 1960 to ""Star Wars"" essentially (not the same though, grumble, grumble). IIIIIIIIIII noticed it. It's not clear why it was there though. It may have been legal plagiarizing, but that's it's only defense. It ""amateurized"" the movie. Robert P.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2044,coqui2k,Indiana Jones is still a Trilogy,6,25 May 2008,"I have been a real big fan of the previous Indiana Jones but this is by far the worst Indy ever. I feel Lucas has destroyed another of his franchises. I feel he put to many Corny sequences like the fridge, monkeys ,and Indy failing to use his whip hardly. The plot is horrible and they used to much CGI (Colorful Gay Images). I believe the alien storyline was a little absurd. Why not concrete on something like the fountain of youth or something somewhat plausible. This entry is totally bogus and it not be called Indiana Jones. It should be called National Treasure the Alien Case. Totally the Indiana Jones movies to me are still a trilogy to me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2045,tjtrumpet-1,Waste of money,1,27 May 2008,"Most if not all of this will be a SPOILER to those who haven't yet seen this movie.Poor production values. It's obvious when a scene switches from an outdoor set to an indoor set, as in one of the opening scenes in front of the warehouse.Obvious CGI scenes.Weak script. Where's the adventure? Where's the plot development? Indy went right to finding the crystal skull with practically nothing getting in his way.All sorts of small twists and turns with no explanation of why they're there.Predictable that Mutt was his son, but it was nice to see Karen Allen back on film.No ""big"" scenes. Almost everything was a close-up or 2 & 3 person shot. part of the allure of Indy films is the big outdoor scenes - this movie had very, very few.Continuity problems - Mutt pulls out a camera in the wedding scene....then we never see the camera again.A car chase/fight scene that presumably goes on for several miles...all thru flat terrain and in a straight line thru cleared jungle...in a jungle that previously needed to be cleared by a bulldozer (earlier in the scene). yeah.....right.When Mutt throws the snake away - a snake the previously had been moving and coiling - was completely limp.Caves with great interior lighting. Lighters that just went over 3 waterfalls yet still ignite on the first try. Mutt doesn't get the least bit dusty climbing thru caves, yet Indy's clothes are covered in dust. Karen Allen's dry hair after being raised from a cave by rushing water. Indy getting out of a refrigerator that didn't have an inside handle, then steps into nuclear fallout...and lives? Yes I know this is all fantasy, but believable fantasy has at least the premise of reality.I could go on, but I kept sitting there saying to myself ""what a waste of $4.75"" (went to a first show of the day / special price deal).The only thing I really enjoyed, besides seeing Karen Allen again, was when the crate containing the Ark was clipped open. Yes, extremely predictable, but a nice ""tip of the hat"" to the original. Would have been better had Indy seen it and given some kind of reaction like ""Hmmm...gotta come back here soon...."" No, I wasn't expecting this to be like the previous 3 - I was expecting it to be better, and a bigger adventure.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2046,mcat0,Indian Jones and the Kingdom of the Adolescent Screenplay,1,29 April 2009,"Very bad, lame and BORING. Who approved this crap? Did anybody bother to read the script? Is Harrison Ford broke? The first ten minutes were mildly entertaining. When Shia LaBeouf arrives as Brando, it quickly goes on its downhill spiral. There are implausible action scenes (the motorcycle chase scene inside the university library was a 'spellbinder', ending with a student casually asking a research question to Dr. Jones.), miraculous escapes (not one but three enormous waterfall tumbles?), archaeological mumbo jumbo (Mayans in Peru?) and a ""plot"" you would need a search warrant to find. The movie often tries to be too cute with its in-joke references to past Indiana Jones' movies. Har-de-har-har. I agree with most other reviewers. Like the post trilogy ""Star Wars"" films, this one is also one colossal disappointment. Anything from George Lucas deserves a ""Z"" cautionary rating warning ZZZZZ. His scripts give new meaning to contrived, over the top, and witless.

2047,zepedamail,Revenge of the IMDb cry babies,10,24 May 2008,"Back in the day, they was no such thing, as the IMDb/Internet cry babies bashing a really great movie. What has the world become... It seems, a bunch of goofs that can't seem to put their SideKicks away. Please grow up and give Spielberg and Lucas a break. A true Indy fan would appreciate this movie. These Indy bashers have No film sense what so ever. I don't care what you guys say, this was an amazing film like all of the others. This is a summer movie in the tradition of the other Indy films. Maybe it is a generational thing. I just don't know about the the harsh reviews that I am seeing here. This movie tips its hat to the serials of the 30s, 40s, 50s; and should be taken in that context. A retelling of current an past myths. No one should not take these things so serious. This is a really fun summer movie.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2048,theinfamouspaw,Good--but so close to great it hurts,7,22 May 2008,"I liked it. I didn't love it, like we all wanted to, but I liked it. The odd thing is that they got all the personal interactions and characters pitch perfect, just right, and the action scenes were what I found lacking--which is the exact opposite of what I expected. Actually, the action scenes for the first half were just right as well, with a few exceptions. I am NOT one of those whiny fan boys who was complaining about CGI before we were given any reason to worry about it, but unfortunately the CGI was indeed a detriment. The things that were happening on screen were no more implausible or outlandish than things from previous Indy movies, but aesthetically they didn't look right, and--more importantly--they didn't feel dangerous. They could have done the same crazy, ridiculous things, but had they used more practical effects it would have been more effective. **spoilers** For instance, the Mutt Williams=George of the Jungle sequence. Had they had him swing from an actual vine onto a tree branch, struggle with his balance, then swing to another branch, it would have felt dangerous. But having him swing around like an animated Tarzan took me completely out of the movie. Also, the jeep chase, which I had been really jazzed about, started out great, then turned into a cartoon. **end spoilers** Anyway, it's obvious I'm a fan of the grittier aspects of the series, so naturally I was disappointed that there was really only one stomp ass, throw down fight between Indy and a Rusky. It was a great scene, though, and pretty much the only scene I really loved in the last half of the movie. The characters were great. I have been very vocal in my doubts about Shia LaBeouf, but not only was he a passable side kick, I might go as far as to say I liked him in this. Certainly, he could not by any stretch carry a movie like this by himself, but as a sidekick, he's one of Indy's best. ***spoilers*** Also, the scene in which they reveal that he's Indy's son was done very well. I dreaded some sappy, overwrought soap opera moment, but they mercifully presented the information quickly, and with a lot of humor ***end spoilers*** So anyway, long story short, it was good, not great. It did not so much satisfy me as whet my appetite for one more--one more with less CGI, and more of Harrison Ford punching people.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2049,Blade_Trinity_Vampire_Hu,Great movie!,8,24 May 2008,"First off, I knew going into this movie that it would not be as good as the previous movies. I knew it had been quite some time between the third and fourth film. There may have been some things within the movie I would have changed, like giving Marion longer screen time. But just the fact she was in it was enough for me. What the youngest generation doesn't realize is that this movie takes place in the 50s and so the CGI will not be state of the art like Star Wars or Transformers. Spielburg and Lucas made it that way on purpose. I think that giving Indiana an arch like him finding out about his son through Marion was fairly decent and definitely interesting, not to mention funny as hell as father and son try to create a bond between them throughout the remainder of the movie. I believe the humor was to appeal to the younger audience because remember, Indiana Jones first came out in '81 and a lot of the kids today weren't around. We grew up with Indiana Jones and so we would know what to expect with the 4th film. The younger generation won't and those that say the CGI was crap and therefore hate the film need to get a reality check because this movie takes place in the 50s and will not be like Terminator. All in all, I would recommend this movie to ANY Indiana Jones fan simply for the thrill of the enjoyment of seeing Harrison Ford on scene again.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2050,smash128,Very enjoyable,9,8 June 2008,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was very enjoyable experience to me as I went and saw it. I grew up watching the Indy films, I believe the first one I saw was Raiders of the Lost Ark back when I was five, that was fifteen years ago and I enjoyed it. Later on I saw Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade and liked them just as much as the first. So what I did I think of number 4, it was great, multiple odes to the first three such as mentioning Marcus Brody and Indy's father, Marion Ravenwood returning, also showing the place where the Ark was kept along with the Ark making a cameo appearance. I believe dare I say it, was better then Temple of Doom. Don't get me wrong the original three were the best, but compared to Raiders and Crusade, Temple of Doom was the weakest, perhaps because there was no Indy fighting Nazis like in 1 and 3, but thats just me. All in all an excellent film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2051,thehopeconspiracy,"Go in with the proper expectations, come out VERY happy!",9,20 May 2008,"I won't go into great detail like some of the reviews, but I did want to put in a few words about the preview screening I saw last night! I did not expect to be seeing the movie until the midnight openings but was contacted last minute about attending a preview screening of the movie last night. To say I have been waiting for this movie for years is an understatement, I watch the DVD's regularly and if any of the three are on TV I will watch with commercials. Now when it comes to this movie, I beforehand set the proper expectations. It's been many years since the last and movies with similar styles (National Treasure,etc..) have come out since. All I can say is that when I walked out of the theater, I was a happy person! It was awkward to see an Indiana Jones movie 'for the first time' and not know every move and event that was coming next. From the opening title to the credits, I was caught up in the moment just like I am when viewing the prior movies. The cast did their job in performing very convincingly each of their characters. The movie was funny, sad, action packed, and ultimately it kept me interested the whole time. I did the best I could to know as little prior to viewing the movie and other then the obvious leaks, it helped me to enjoy the moment. Whether a fifth movie will be made, who knows but all I know is that I am excited. At the same time I am sad because what myself and everyone else have been waiting for has arrived. In the end to everyone who will be seeing the movie in a day or two, be excited! The movie will have you on the edge of your seat like the first three and I can say without a doubt TRUE INDY fans will LOVE IT!No it's not the best movie of all time, but it does the series justice! I will go out on limb after first viewing and put this as either my second or third favorite out of the floor .... it is for you to guess what comes before and after it :)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Steven was brilliant as always. George found great story. It's perfect movie for older and younger audience. This is the kind of movie where you can find a lot of fun, great music, epic tale and some pictures that you will never forget.

2053,xfilmknight,Better to have watched and hated than to never have watched at all,6,27 November 2014,"There are two different perspectives to consider when reviewing the film. There is the point of a view of the fans who have grown up loving the Indiana Jones Franchise, whether it be as a person of the generation watching it at its original release in theaters or watching them subsequently as a child at home raised to adore the legendary hero. They are the die hard fans who were anxiously waiting after hearing the first rumblings of the possible reemergence of the rugged hero putting his hat on one last time. And then the vantage point of the everyday movie goer. People that have either never seen the original films or those that have not taken into the Indiana Jones cult phenomenon. Regardless of which category you fall into, unfortunately you will be heavily disappointed. Lists can be made of everything wrong with the movie. To point out a few...Rustic cinematography style failing to capture the original feel; Terrible dialogue; Aliens; Magnets that only work whenever the scene calls for it; Over the top obvious stunt double usage; Surviving a nuclear blast by a refrigerator; Ridiculous scenes that make you say things like, What? Really? Why?; Abundant amount of visually unappealing and corny CGI; Awkward and cheesy usage of comic relief scenes; Cliché after cliché; And I'm sure many others that all would agree to...Notice though that unlike many others I did not say Shia LaBeouf. I am not necessarily a fan nor a hater of his but personally I don't care about his personal life and his shenanigans and will not say he's a problem in the movie just for the sake of saying it. Let's not blame the actor on this one, he may have played the character but George Lucas created him and with him or without him this movie still blows. Being an Indiana Jones fan I can say that this movie is a huge grade A piece of sh!t. However, I still watched it a couple times and will not say that they should never have made this movie to begin with. Being a fan of the franchise the film was undeniably and unequivocally disappointing. The entire film is a montage of the previous films within the franchise. Bits and pieces of what was loved before redone in various ways to tug the heart strings of the fans. The Indiana Jones-isms that we can all remember. Pulling his hat above his eyes to sleep, genius knowledge the archaeological field, pointing and counting, correcting himself after discovering the real meaning behind riddled messages, his fear of snakes, the shadowed webs in hidden chambers, secret latches opening doors, and many others. Was it over the top? Yes. Was it becoming corny? Yes. Was there a lack of creativity? Yes. But at the end of the day as fans of the movie you could not help but at least get nostalgic from the previous films. The moment the hat was thrown to the ground and the iconic figure came to screen, you felt goosebumps crawling up and down your arms. Throughout the film you were saying to yourself, ""I know exactly where that is from and why that is in the movie."" You started to see Indiana Jones turn into his father portrayed by Sean Connery in the previous film. Started to see all the idiosyncrasies of the original Henry Jones Sr transfer into Indiana. You said to yourself, ""Indy's father called him, 'Junior' and now Indy is calling his, 'Son'."" There were many moments throughout the film that made you make comparisons or think of the previous movies. And it's those moments that make the movie at the very least worth watching. It's those moments that make you smile and remember why you wanted to watch the movie to begin with. Unfortunately it's also those moments that make you say ""WTF"" at the end because it only reminds you that much more of how much you love the franchise. If you're a fan of the franchise, regardless of what others say including myself, watch the movie. Make your own decision about it. You'll probably hate it but watch it anyways. It'll give you flickers of happiness. It'll bring back memories. Watch it just to say you've seen the entire franchise. Watch it just to prove to others how much of a fan you are with you're ability to point out everything wrong with it. Watch it so you can join the hate with other Indy fans. No matter the reason watch the movie. You'll be disappointed. You'll hate it. But you'll still be glad you watched it. If you are not familiar with Indiana Jones the movie objectively is definitely watchable. For fans there were moments that were great due to its ability to recreate nostalgic feelings, but these moments will be new to you and will create the same feelings that the fans have gotten when first watching the films. Objectively there is an ""OK"" story line, solid action sequences, good use of humor here and there, and a steady pace throughout the film. If you haven't seen the other films within the franchise, I highly encourage you watch those first. If you are not a fan after watching the original franchise films there is no way in hell you will be a fan of ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" Flat out won't happen. You will not be converted by watching this film. If for whatever reason you hated the original franchise movies, you will turn this off within the first 15 minutes. But let's be honest, if you are not a fan of the original franchise you are not even reading this review because you are not a screen junkie or movie fanatic or whatever else you want to call it. If you love movies, you love Indiana Jones. Period.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2054,jwillie00,Have fun with it,10,24 May 2008,"I absolutely loved Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I didn't go into the movie theater to critique this movie and tear it apart, I went into the theater to have fun and enjoy a movie. It had everything I wanted. A lot of people are bashing this movie because of the contents and subject it dealt with, but they didn't make this movie for what everyone wanted they made it to coincide with the 50's. Just ask yourself what were the biggest events in the 50's and what was on everyone's mind, then i think you can understand why they went with the story they went with.If your going to see this movie to nitpick every aspect of it, then don't bother your going to hate it no matter what. But, if your going to go see it and just watch a movie for fun, you will.Life is to short people, don't over analysis everything. Have fun and enjoy something once in a while.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2055,RidetoGondor,Entertaining but not quite the old Indiana Jones,6,26 May 2008,"Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is certainly an entertaining movie but it does NOT feel like an Indiana Jones movie if you compare it to the first three (yes, I'm including Temple of Doom in that count). The actors are fairly solid in the roles but the lack of characterization and the weak screenplay drags the movie down.As our hero Harrison Ford mumbles a couple of lines but he is in excellent form for his age. The biggest problem is he doesn't get enough screen time, probably due to the fact that there are five/six ""good guys"" on screen together at all times from the middle of the film on. From about the middle of the film on, Indy just becomes one of the group and follows John Hurt's character around instead of being the active hero and using his plethora of historical knowledge to decipher clues and figure out what to do next as he did in the earlier movies.Marion, while nice to see Karen Allen again, only has about ten good minutes of real screen time before the film completely sets her in as a background character.Poor Ray Winstone plays such a badly written character that the movie would be better off without his character, period. Shia LeBouf is a nice sidekick for Indiana and does well with his acting but going back to Indiana not having enough screen time, it felt like he took too much away from Harrison Ford; putting him in the background instead of Marion for a few scenes might have helped. John Hurt's character is interesting to watch... but no one really knows who he is! Since Marion is back in the film, why not make him her father, Abner? That would have opened up a great opportunity for character development.The main bad guy is Soviet Irina Spalko, played by Cate Blanchett. Blanchett can do no wrong, no matter how ridiculous the role, and the only flaw about her performance is how she slips into an English accent whenever she says ""Dr. Jones."" Unlike the villains in the other films, Cate and her posse never pose a serious threat. There just isn't that sense of underlying menace that the other films had, and a film without a real antagonist always suffers. When Spalko meets her demise it just feels wrong since Spalko just doesn't seem that bad.The CGI isn't as bad as expected from all the whining on the IMDb message board but there are certainly some scenes that are completely ridiculous like Tarzan Mutt and the CGI prairie dogs in the beginning that detract from the setting of the movie. Would it really have been that hard to use trained prairie dogs instead of CGI ones? That would have kept the comedy but made it at least bit more realistic.Now to examine the biggest storyline issue that plagues The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from beginning to end.A lot of people dislike the alien angle in the storyline, and I agree. It feels a bit TOO supernatural for an Indiana Jones movie. The other three movies involved objects and ideas based in established world religions with a controlled touch of the supernatural that usually surfaced towards the end. While belief in the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail is well documented in the Christian faith, and it is entirely plausible that as in all religions Mola Ram and his cult devoted to the goddess Kali have taken their belief and rituals to a dark extreme over stones that appear to have magical qualities, the real quartz skulls found in Mexico in the early 1920s are not genuine objects worshiped by Mayas nor featured in their pantheon and rituals as suggested in the movie. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull suggests that Mayan deities are in fact aliens that showed the Mayans farming, etc., and the Mayas began to bind their own heads so they would resemble their deities, etc. (By the way, the Mayas lived in central America, not South America, so why is Indy going to Peru and Brazil instead of Central America? Someone did sloppy research and confused the Mayas with the Incas. Way to check the facts!)That takes a lot away in my opinion as Indiana Jones movies were always based in true archeology despite the more supernatural twists taken towards the end of the movies. Yes, psychics in the last century claim that the skulls have supernatural powers and, it is possible that Stalin was interested in those supposed supernatural qualities of the skulls, but none of this is based in ancient history. Part of the greatness of Indiana Jones is the history behind the stories, and the background storyline in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, while involving a conquistador, just doesn't have the interest or logic behind it that the other three did.As opposed to searching for an object like in the first and second movies or deciphering why the cult in the second movie is obsessed with the stones, Indiana Jones doesn't seem to be doing much other than following a crazed old man (John Hurt's character) with his supernatural alien skull that almost always reveals the next step in the journey as opposed to Indiana Jones himself figuring out the next step himself like in the other movies. And that, ladies and gentleman, isn't all that interesting to watch in my humble opinion.Conclusion: If you are the average moviegoer, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is worth watching in the theater as it is an exciting spectacle to watch and won't make you use your brain too much. If you are a die-hard Indy fan, however, prepare to be disappointed as this movie lacks the characterization and storyline that made the other three so special.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2056,JBR152,Indy is back and so is all the fun that made the originals what they are today!,8,22 May 2008,"I just got back from a midnight showing of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and decided to give my input. Like most people, I grew up with Indiana Jones. To this day, Raiders is easily in my top 5 films ever made. I love Temple of Doom, and thought Last Crusade was a hell of a time. Ever since I saw the shot of Indy and his gang riding off into the sunset, I knew I wanted another adventure.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is that adventure and I loved every minute of it. As we all know, the story takes place in 1957. The Nazis have been replaced with the Russians and Indiana Jones is 20 years older. Marion Ravenwood returns and rebellious greaser, Mutt Williams joins them. This time they are after a Crystal Skull that has mysterious powers just like the three previous artifacts that Indy discovered.The opening scene is incredible, as we return to the warehouse last seen at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Here we see Indiana Jones for the first time since Last Crusade. He is older. Wiser. More mature. But the man can still use his whip. The thing with Crystal Skull that I really loved was that this is a different Indy. If you go in to this movie expecting to see some crazy stunts like in the previous films then you won't be satisfied. Indiana has settled down. He is in his 60's. We know what he is capable of. We know how tough he is. They didn't have to show him be the tough as nails archaeologist that we came to love because we are so familiar with him. What Spielberg did this time around was have an Indy that is more in the role of Henry Jones Sr from Last Crusade.In a way, we have watched Indiana grow up over the course of the four films. We've seen him as the young hero and now we see him as the older hero. Spielberg said that he was making this movie for the fans. He didn't come out to make this better than Raiders. He came out to bring us Indy one last time. To show that just like all of us, Indy has grown up with the times, but he still has it in him for one last adventure.Shia Labeouf was great as Mutt. I honestly wouldn't mind seeing a spin off with just him. Marion is always great and the chemistry between her and Indy is perfect. Irina plays the villain role very well, but she is no Belloq.For all the complaining about the CG and the impossible sequences, again, this was Spielberg and the crew having fun. They weren't trying to win an Oscar. They just wanted to bring back Indiana Jones. Throughout the whole film, Harrison Ford seemed like he was having a blast and so was I, and isn't that what movies are all about? The entire alien angle was done very well. This is the 1950's. Everyone was talking about aliens, and little green men, and the race to space around this era. It was nice to see Indy go after something different this time around.All in all, even though it didn't feel like the original three, it was a great addition. As long as you come in just wanting to have a fun time at the movies, then you will love this movie. The action sequences are amazing, the story is very original, and Indiana Jones is back!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2057,JacktheBear,"I Wanted to like it, I really did! (Spoilers)",3,24 May 2008,"First off, two things about this movie I can give a positive review. 1) It looked good, Kaminski and the ILM guys really made a pretty looking film. 2) Cate Blanchete and Karen Allen were great. That's right the ladies rocked the house!All other parts of this film were a painful exercise of sad failure. I went and saw this film this weekend, and wanted to like it. I really wanted to like it; but it fell so far below the line of acceptable film-making, it was laughable. I completely agree with George Lucas's statement that people will dislike it, because of expectations. The only problem is; it didn't fail my expectations of an Indiana Jones movie; it failed my expectations of a Spielberg movie . . . and a GOOD movie. I know they did this as fun and a chance to revisit a beloved institution, but everyone involved half-assed it so much, that the failure was STAGGERING!The mythology they attempted to investigate and uncover is so poorly investigated (""The crystal skulls were made by aliens!"" ""Really? That's silly"" ""No Really"" ""Oh, OK."" that is the plot! Didn't Indy, and EVERYONE take pause when someone talked about the REALLY unbelievable?I, again, wanted to like it. There were parts I did like, but those grew few as the film wore on. The sets looked like they were shot on sound stages, and the story feel apart in a mess of epic proportions in the last 15 minutes.I was always a defender of George Lucas, I liked the Star Wars prequels, they were by no means to the level of the original trilogy, but there were some good points and great Sci-Fi moments, but this film fell so far behind what most consider to be a good film, that I was sad for all involved.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2058,kingsandpriests,Very Good,6,27 May 2008,"Okay, so Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull wasn't great, but it also wasn't the disaster that people are making it out to be. Let's face it, any movie that people have been waiting on for almost 20 years is going to be a disappointment in some ways. Yes, there were many times throughout the movie where I laughed at the implausibility of a stunt or thought that something was extremely corny, but then I remembered that the Indiana Jones movies have never been realistic. After watching this one in theaters, I went back and watched the first three on DVD. I was surprised at all the campy action and corny special effects that I had forgotten about. Somehow, I just overlooked those things. Everyone talks about how bad the latest Indy movie is, but it makes me wonder if they any of those people are truly Indy fans at all. Go back and review the first three and you'll see that ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" delivers just as much as the others. In my book, slightly better than ""Temple of Doom"" which was just as outlandish and unrealistic.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2059,clawdagon,"Just like ""More American Graffiti/Godfather III/Jaws 3""!",1,23 May 2008,"Fans,I thought I was lucky; I got a prime seat in a great theater with a digital projector to see the fourth installment.It came on and I loved the opening sequence establishing the time period with teenagers in a hot-rod trying to out-race a US (later to be revealed as Russian) army convoy in the desert. Indy's glorious first appearance being tossed out of the car truck was great.It went down-hill from there with Cate Blanchett as the main Russian heavy. She's not ""Irma Bunt"" the villain from ""From Russia with Love"" who exuded menace and evil. Blanchett's character was too one-dimensional; I liked her better as Bob Dylan in ""I'm Not There"".Gunpowder is magnetic? The fight scene lacked the cohesiveness of the first three movies, what's with the rocket sled? If the Russian enemy researched the surroundings and knew the area why did they drive into an atomic test site ready for detonation?The cycle chase with Indy and Mud needed some editing; it had some good parts but went on too long. Indy's exchange with the archeology student in the library was badly executed; it should have elicited roars of laughter instead of a chuckle. The scene at Nazca lacked any suspense or drama; I was noticing how uncomfortable I was in my seat which is a bad sign. The natives were not particularly frightening enough as the scene dragged on.The main action sequence was jumbled and incoherent with characters hopping in and out of cars, driving close to the cliff's edge and had no excitement. It must be fun to drop over three waterfalls and not receive any injuries. Marion revealing that Mud was Indy's son was clumsily revealed with Indy not convincingly upset or surprisedThere was a major visual mistake in the throne room with the blue-screen elements. I saw the wall break off and reveal the ""outer void"" or ""next dimension"" before that scene occurred with the room started to spin.I walked out feeling very under-whelmed and disappointed, seeing ""Ironman"" by contrast was incredibly entertaining and fun.There was no desire to see the film again like I did after seeing the first ""Star Wars"" or ""Lost Ark"".Spielberg definitely dropped the ball on this on like he did on ""1941""!BTW, not automatically praising the film does not make me mentally deficient or stupid, I like the ""Indiana Jones"" movies but I'm not a true believer.Claw",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2060,uniqueduck,Self-Aware Yes...Entertaining...Yes...Classic...Not Really,8,26 May 2008,"I watched the other three films afresh before watching this one. The original have an instant classic quality. They are intentionally made to look dated like the serials of old. This film is set after WWII and toward the end of the 1950's. Someone noted that this is wrong and that it set Indy out of his time. I think that theme should have been explored. When indy was being chased through the test site neighborhood I couldn't help but think how strange it was to see the rugged leather hero in the bright 1950's. Indy has become an anarchism himself. It's also odd to see the first 1/4-1/2 of the movie based in the US. Furthermore, the first and third films (fan favorites) are grounded in historical events and religious artifacts. Things, places, and people that are familiar yet exotic. Fantasy grounded in accepted reality. The story and mythos used here is not as grounded nor as well known to most of the audience.Over all this film is a satisfactory return of a film icon. The son and marriage angle were handled as best as possible. Although this sort of thing always seems contrived. If there is to be a sequel any idea George Lucas has expressed should be avoided. The concept of the Son of Indiana Jones trilogy is a waste of time. It would have to take place in the 60's-70's and I can't see it working at all.I suspect Indy has one more adventure left in him but the fantastical nature of the this film leaves little room for another mystical artifact. It would have to be either a return of the Ark plot (bad idea) or a return to history with the magic on the periphery until the the end. As with the earlier films. In the earlier adventures the fantastic was always sensed but remained to be seen. Hinted at but not known. Here we get the idea in the first 20 minutes. No mystery. A good motivation for a final film is that the now older and domesticated Indy is having a hard time adjusting. Just as he snuck out his office window to go on high adventures I could see him jumping up for one last quest. The ultimate quest...the ultimate find. However, it can't be something His father and Marcus spent their lives looking for because that's been done.I was satisfied and greatly enjoyed this film. I acknowledge it's faults. I think we all need to accept the fact that we will never be able to reclaim the glory of our icons or the films in which they appear. Our childhood is gone and the era of their creation has passed. Heroes age and adventures retire. We need to be great full for any sequel that comes close to the glory of our memories.

2061,william_wallace6,Story drags down movie,6,18 May 2008,"I just got back from a sneak peak of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and I was thoroughly disappointed. I am huge fan of the original trilogy, don't get me wrong. But the worst thing about this movie is what made the others so good; story. In my opinion, the story does not fit well with the original trilogy and is badly written. Shia is very good; except for one ridiculous scene. Shooting this movie ""the old fashioned way"" with little to no cgi is a lie; there is plenty of over-the-top cgi so thank you Lucas. Overall I think I am going to be in the minority here mainly due to the fact that people will have ""fun"" so will automatically love the movie.

But it entertained me for the two and a half or three hours that I was sitting in the theater. The whole ""there's aliens in South America"" thing was just ridiculous. My absolute favorite Indiana Jones movie was The Last Crusade, by far. This one, although it was good, just wasn't as fulfilling as as the previous three. I couldn't believe that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had sunk so low as to include aliens in an Indiana Jones movie. But, the music was good, as they'd again hired John Williams to do the score(who's never done a bad score). So the bottom line is that I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it as just too weird to even be considered for its realism.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2063,solidusr4s,Indiana Jones back to the origins of Civilization,9,28 November 2008,"Well first of all I've always been a fan of Indiana Jones series and the stories about the holy bible (except temple of Doom that was kinda lame)like the ark of the covenant and the holy grail.But the story of Crystal Kingdom and Aka tosh existed thousands year before the holy bible was written. I understand that fans of the Indiana Jones are bashing this movie because i think lack of knowledge of the story. Well I can ramble about the story but this is a short indication.The story about the crystal kingdom is Fake but well written( This is not the story of Indiana Jones movie) it begins thousands of years before the first civilization was created "" the ancient Sumerians "". There was belief that the ancient Sumerians knowledge came from the Gods of the Sky or should I say ALIENS that was the same to say about the Mayans.Those to civilizations were some of the examples that we owe our future technology and knowledge from like Schools, Building constructions, and Time/Calender etc. Well continuing about the story I really loved the story 'because the Sumerians and Mayans are a obsession for me'.Indiana Jones is looking for a friend with the help of hormone d controlled teenager Mud. In search of their friend. They stumble on a treasure that their friend/step dad was looking for. While their quest still continues they'll have lots of confrontations with old friends and the persistent Russians looking for KNOWLEDGE. Well I know the movie had some flaws like "" the snake pulling, vine swinging "" I know they were over the top but this doesn't mean this was a bad movie. It was a fun popcorn flick with real facts that you can learn from not everything of course hehe.

2064,Tribad,Written and directed by Michael Bay.,1,1 June 2008,"This is probably the most useful comment you're likely to read, because it sums up the majority of the comments in a single phrase: Avoid this awful piece of s**t! IJ4 was so incredibly bad, that I can't even begin to describe it, though others have tried and failed before me. It simply has to be seen to be believed, and therein lies the problem, because the less people who see this bad scripted cgi-travesty of a Disney theme park-ride, the better.George Lucas and Steven Spielberg should be sentenced to death for this crime against humanity. Shame on you.At least the perfect trilogy is still intact..thank god!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2065,naboof11,Indiana Jones and the Perilous Writing of George Lucas,6,22 May 2008,"I should warn this will contain spoilers, and that it may be biased as I am an Indy purist, but I will be fair, rampant fanboyism notwithstanding.The Indiana Jones movies are, to me, some of the best American cinema. While the material presented in the films is clearly not Citizen Kane, Indy has been an American hero icon since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rugged, gruff, goofy, and lovable, Harrison Ford as Indiana is one of the best heroes ever produced. The development and production values have always been top-notch as well, with the best Hollywood director and great writer combining to make a fantastic movie series. Spielberg and Lucas brought the adventure of 1930s serials back into American cinema in the 80s like no one else could. Indy is the essential American hero. Not a super-human with unbelievable powers, but an average academic who loves archeology and has a penchant for ending up in wild situations. No director/writer/actor combo has ever come close to besting Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford in terms of pure, fun adventure.And that's why it's so hard to admit that IJatKotCS is the Indy movie I feared. It would be an act of hardship to top the first films, but IJatKotCS manages to take Indy to the limit and shatter the concepts of what an Indiana Jones film is. As my title suggests, I blame Lucas, because he has apparently lost the ability to make stories that inspire greatness and instead now makes stories which inspire absurdity. Not that the premise of an adventurous professor who finds artifacts and then chases down Nazis isn't absurd already, but that is a lovable and expected absurdity, a staple of the Indy trademark. This new absurdity is more devious; why, George, did you have to add aliens? Star Wars is one thing, but Indiana Jones? Honestly, George, you have gone too far. The fact that Ford, Labeouf, and supporting cast make up for your misplaced writing with classic Indy flair only barely covers the fact that you have replaced much of what we loved about Indy with impossible stunts, improbable situations, and aliens! There is a breaking point and the finale of IJatKotCS was it. Yes, Lucas, writer, somehow managed to convince Spielberg and Ford to add elements to IJatKotCS that I thought were reserved for Star Wars or Close Encounters. I had heard that there were aliens in the first drafts of this new script, but George had ""subdued"" his original vision. Well, George, if you consider what you created for this finale subtle, then I can only imagine your original script.I should mention that although the movie suffers from this addition, the movie is not terrible. Far from it. The acting is fantastic: Ford returns as Indy, and instantly proves he still has it. Labeouf proves a surprisingly welcome addition, and the supporting cast is well-played. The first hour of the movie is enjoyable, and Spielberg manages to capture the wonder of the first three films for a brief, sparkling moment. He also captures the era as well- it's not the 1930s anymore. And, of course, Williams' score is more than enough to bring nostalgia to the entire affair. But then, just as the movie begins to seem like a worthy addition, there is a stark and violent detachment from normal Indy parameters.After the first hour the plot begins to fade into crazy stunts and extraterrestrial menaces. Ford and Labeouf hold it together as best they can, but when the script calls for a vine-swinging episode and a sword-fight on speeding DUKWs there is really little they can do. And we cannot forget the alien menace, which at first does seem subdued, until Lucas' true colors show and he begins to have Indy seeing invaders up-close. And the grand finale is out of the X-Files.I find myself under the impression of having just been slapped across the face by Lucas. The Indy I know deals mostly with Biblical artifacts and curses, or material under the blanket of ancient religions. Sure, there has always been supernatural material in Indiana Jones, but it was always in an ancient, mummy type package. Indy finds the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, and sacred Hindu stones. Indy visits locations in the ancient world while solving ancient mysteries. Indy deals with archeology, not Mars. Sadly, not anymore.I respect the decision to base the movie 19 years since Crusade. I respect Lucas bringing in a Soviet enemy. I even respect Lucas' wish to base this installment on the serials of the 1950s, which dealt largely with aliens. But to shamelessly incorporate material that has no basis in an Indy movie is too much to bear. Lucas should have taken the hint from the latest Star Wars movies: more is not always better. More stunts, more creatures, and more aliens do not bring back the Indiana Jones of old. Nostalgia dies hard at the end of this film.Nevertheless, Ford still has Indy-style. Spielberg directs a mean movie, and the writing is good for the first half. But the ending is hard to watch if you consider yourself an Indy purist, someone who believes Indy fights ancient cults while discovering artifacts. With so many other avenues Lucas could have taken with this latest Indiana, adding ET is a hard move to justify.I say to fans of the first three to go see this movie for Ford, Spielberg, Labeouf, the music of Williams, and the fedora. See it for that classic Indy swagger this has, albeit in sparing amount. But be warned Lucas has once again proved himself to be unable to control his urge to feverishly add unwanted material to his former masterpieces. IJatKotCS lodges itself in fourth place in the Indy legacy, and I will try hard to forget the final images of the alien menace- although I fear doing so will be a truly out-of-this-world task.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2066,scott7278,"Good Entertainment, Not So Good Sequel",7,25 May 2008,"The chief flaw of this movie is the utter failure to keep the fundamental character of Indiana Jones consistent with the first three movies. The most you could accuse Jones of was seeking fortune and glory (as Willie did in Temple of Doom), but never power.In 1936, he goes looking for the Ark of the Covenant. His goal was not to be the first to unleash its power, but to get it away from the Nazis and into the hands of people who will properly research it.In 1938, he goes looking for the Holy Grail, once again to keep it out of the hands of the Nazis. He let Elsa know that he was nothing like her, that he wouldn't have done anything to get it. He never craved the power that the cup offered, and he was not the one who tried to cross the seal.This basic character trait was even revealed in the Last Crusade as far back as 1912, when as a young man he was concerned about getting the Cross of Coronado into a museum.However, by 1957 Indiana Jones has apparently changed, and forgotten the events of the past. In keeping in character with the original trilogy, he might have used the crystal skull to find the artifacts and try to decipher the mystery, but he would never have gone into the room where the so-called power was waiting to be given. Seeking power has always been met with disastrous consequences in Indiana's world.His goal would have been to get the artifacts into a museum, and get the crystal skull as far away as possible so that there would be no way for the Soviets to succeed in their mission. I expected the Soviets to capture him on the way out, and force him to accompany them into the room, ala Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was simply out of character for him to enter that room without coercion, especially when he knew of their determination. This would have been like him opening the Ark in the first movie -- it was simply not possible.The movie itself deviates from the first three in that it moved from the supernatural into science fiction. The entire time, I thought we were going to be thrown for a loop, that the aliens were actually demonic and that it wasn't a good thing to use the crystal skull to open the door in the first place. As the key, Indiana could have also used it to close them in (he would have to shut it anyway), experiencing the destructive power they were desiring to receive.I hoped beyond hope that we were going to see a final scene with the familiar pulsating bass sound, where we see the Ark of the Covenant begin to glow and burn out of its box, as a symbolic representation of good versus evil.Instead, we got Close Encounters of the Third Kind II: Indiana Jones Edition. It didn't make me hate the movie, but I wish that Lucas and Spielberg would have remembered which movie they were making.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

2068,TedMoseby,The difference between plausibility and absurdity,1,4 June 2008,"After just seeing this movie, I will say whole heartedly that I did not hate it. But, very sadly, I did not like Indy 4 either. After reflecting about it, it comes down to the difference between plausibility and absurdity. For me, the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail are plausible and historical items one would really believe Dr. Jones would seek. Even the stones in Temple were plausible. All of these artifacts had this spiritual aspect to them. Even if one would doubt the existence of the stones in Temple, they were important to the villagers and for Jones to get them back for their spiritual value. The Ark and the Grail speak for themselves in terms of spiritual relevance (even if one is agnostic or atheist I think they could appreciate their historically spiritual significance). Now the Crystal Skull by itself seemed plausible at the beginning at the movie. But it was the end of the movie, along with other scenes, that stretched plausibility into absurdity.Right off the bat, we are supposed to believe that a small Russian army is operating in the United States at the beginning of the movie. Moreover, they were easily able to breach Area 51. I was willing to go along with this, but it struck me as absurd. I thought the Russian special force was the only thing I would have to suspend by belief on, which I was perfectly willing to do. But then came the nuclear bomb that Dr Jones survived. Why was this scene in the movie? Yes is was during 1957, but I would hope viewers would know nuclear testing was going on. What did this have to do with the Crystal Skull? Other scenes, like the dead alien and the scene where Mutt goes Tarzan with CGI monkeys threw plausibility out the window. I am still not sure how Russians were able to procure a dead alien corpse. And what did that have to do with the Skull? I sat in my chair just shaking my head that these great minds of cinema(especially Spielberg) thought these would be a great movie scenes. Finally, the extra dimensional aliens? I was hoping that part might be left ambiguous. Going back to the theme of spirituality, I had hopped that the skull might have that same occultish/spiritual power that the artifacts in the other movies possessed. Instead of exploring the mythology of mind control, Indy 4 delved into the absurd, with all the crystal aliens gathering in their spaceship to go to another dimension. We were left to wonder if the mind powers of the skull were true, and we were treated to a sci fi ending. Like I said before, I did not hate this movie. But this excursion into the absurd will forever put this film at the bottom of the Indy movies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2069,lisarose13317,Everything we could have hoped for...and more.,10,23 May 2008,"For a sequel to be this good--let alone a sequel released nearly two decades after the previous installment--is an incredible achievement, and one that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull pulls off nearly perfectly. Spielberg and Lucas are pushing the nostalgia factor to the hilt--references to old characters and classic lines abound, and as I've sure you've heard, Marion Ravenwood is back in a brilliant performance--but the world of Indiana Jones has also changed, and grown. It's the fifties now, with all the cultural details that implies, and the movie briefly touches on the idea that maybe, just maybe, the world is ready to leave Jones behind.Then that action starts, and we know that, on some level, we will always need Indiana Jones. What can I say? This just feels like an Indiana Jones movie, and there's really no higher praise than that. Harrison Ford reprises his character with all his usual brilliance; Cate Blanchett is the best villain the series has ever seen; and Shia LaBeouf is full of the same charm and talent that has been making him a star lately. The action is as good as anything we've ever seen, and the special effects, while spectacular, are used in (for lack of a better term) good taste. In other words, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull feels like it was filmed just a few years after the other three, but reaps all the benefits of new technology.If you had any interest at all in the original trilogy, this is a must see.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

Action packed, humor, and a touch of romance. So when I found out the movie was coming out, I was super excited especially since they kept Harrison Ford. I've always been a fan of Harrison Ford but was a bit worried that maybe he was a bit too old for this movie, since Indiana Jones was always known to be an action packed archaeologist. This movie was a huge disappointment to me. More drama than archeology. More action than common sense. This movie had a huge budget but even a bigger disappointment. The ending had to be probably the worst I've seen. Not just for this franchise but in any movie.

2071,rickandinger,At least it didn't have Hayden Christensen,6,23 May 2008,"I won't include any plot spoilers.First of all, let me say that Karen Allen has not aged well. I kept hoping Boone would come and carry her back to the Delta House. As for Harrison Ford, well I'll leave that to the ladies, but he still hasn't learned to correctly pronounce the word ""nuclear."" On the other hand, neither has our president, so there you go.Plot: The opening sequence is weak. I didn't buy into the scenario, and the villains failed to interest me. It ends with the audience looking around and asking, ""Are you freaking kidding me?"" The main plot, centered around the Crystal Skull, is OK, but the movie turns into the parent trap, like National Treasure 2; has long fight scenes that fail to keep your interest, like Pirates 2; and gives us cute animals that seem out of place, like Return of the Jedi. And for a while, I thought Tom Cruise was about to jump out of a spider hole and give a treatise on Scientology. Acting: John Hurt should win an Oscar for supporting actor. He's that good. Everybody else was somewhat flat.Characters: Shia Lebeouf is fairly predictable, and spell-check is furious with me right now. Kate Blanchett is less than a memorable villain. There's one new character that we're not supposed to be sure about, whether he's a good guy or a bad guy or whatI was sure. They didn't conceal it that well.Intangibles: About 69 sight gags with Indiana Jones's hat (and not in a good way)obligatory chase/fight scene in which all but the main characters are dispensed withcheckuttering of the phrase ""I've got a bad feeling about this""checkEwoksalmostCGIcheckjokes about being rackedcheckNazisnopecommiescheck.All in all, it gets a 7 out of 10 when you walk in, just because it's Indiana Freaking Jones.

2072,ikbengerrit,Are Lucas and Spielberg losing it?,5,22 May 2008,"Yesterday i went to see the new movie. Since i am a real fan, off course i won the look-a-like competition, my expectations were high. But i tempered them knowing that as good as raiders and last crusade would be nearly impossible. It wasn't enough. The crystal skull had not much to do with the classic three. It missed a lot of critical things to make it Indy worthy. They tried to evolve the genre while i was just waiting for another adventure of Jones. It could have been the sequel to triple X. Pick any adventure movie and swap the main character with Indy. That would have been fine, but no.If i picture Dr Jones in my mind i see him on his own exploring some old dig-site or other historical place and after some exploring all of a sudden he rolls into adventure. Some other things that made the old movies marvelous. It was pure: Indy got into trouble he does some real quick thinking and solves the problem with something plain and simple but therefor genius. A couple of Mano a Mano fights. Action and adventure scenes with in between some dull research. Which makes it all look like it could have been possible.For this matter Indy 4 starts off pretty good. It will make you accept the fact that he isn't a young dog anymore. He escapes some hazardous situations with style. But it is a bit to much, over the top and not realistic anymore, even for Indiana Jones. It hurts saying that. Unfortunately it is true. Besides the exaggeration an other thing which is lacking is the research. He looks more like a detective looking for a missing person. This is not a #!@@$##!! movie! For example he arrives somewhere in an foreign country and the next scene he walks up in an easily accessible temple like building. No puzzling, no exploring at all, if i where on Holiday there i would have found it as well. Too easy! And then the Russians. They show up far to often. In the old days Indy slips under the radar and goes his own genius way. But now everywhere he goes those Russians show up. So if we make a count: Indy, 20 Russians, his sidekick, Karen Allen, Mac and another man. That is archeology with almost 30 people! That's bull. The movie failed at giving me the feeling he is out there on his own on the edge of something very very mysteriously important. Too bad, that is what i liked about it. That is what wanted me to be Indy. However the point were i really thought ""okey, no way back, this movie is going to suck big time"" is when some 20 year old boy is swinging like Tarzan through the jungle followed by a dozen monkeys to interfere with Indy's car chase! Why?! This isn't Tarzan nor Jungle Book. The Mogli boy and his monkeys enter the car from above and kick some Russian ass but why! It doesn't make sense! And to make it even worse, ah I'm not going to tell you.One last thing i want to say is that i was about 12 years old when i first saw Crusade and the others, perhaps at that time i didn't see the flaws of those movies and never did ever since because as a child it is like you see it is. Nothing to doubt about that. Perhaps that's why I'm giving Indy 4 such a hard time. Go ahead and watch it, after all it's Indy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2073,werner-36,Indy has left the planet,3,18 June 2008,"In retrospect it's not surprising that there wasn't a decent trailer to be found of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The reason is simple; it doesn't hold up to the light that was Raiders and even the first two sequels; however increasingly improbable they were, they were entertaining and still Indy. This time, this script, everything went wrong. Indy doesn't get anywhere near as angry, agile and/or cynical as the Indy we've become to love, plus Spielberg and Lucas should have put him on a mild diet. Speaking of a diet, why wasn't Karen Allen re-cast? The minute she appeared on screen, that was it for me. That plus the ridiculous script that we've been waiting on for 19 years, while the storyline for The Fate Of Atlantis was easily good enough? Ms Allen's acting consisted solely of keeping her face-lift in place ALL of the time. Plus she didn't exactly appeal to my manly sense of romance. And believe me, that usually doesn't take a lot. The little dialogue she DID have, she managed to spoil. All in all, Marion Ravenwood should have been a woman the viewer should still fall in love with, even if you haven't seen her for 19 years... Speaking of love, let's talk about hate. Kate Blanchett is an actress I greatly admire, but she didn't make an impression this time around. Maybe because she couldn't hold her Russian accent, maybe because she just wasn't enough of a baddie to be remembered. Or maybe it was the script. AGAIN.The only good surprise was Mutt. Great acting. Shame of the Brando copy, wasn't necessary for this part to work.I sat watching this movie, spying for that old Indy feeling, and what I got was An Old Indy Feeling. Crappy (and rare) dialogue, unbelievable (and I mean REALLY unbelievable) situations and stunts and a script that wasn't worth waiting a week for, let alone 19 years, I am unhappy to say that this was my first Indy let-down.

It received loud applause from the audience, both before and after the movie had been shown.This movie was incredible, mind-blowing entertainment, full of excitement, action and humor, as well as a bit of romance. I must say that I may very well be the biggest Indiana Jones fan there is, but I believe everyone can find something they like in this old-fashioned adventure film. I was actually even surprised a bit by how great it actually was, I could never have expected anything this good! It was, to say the least, on par with the original trilogy. (In part I think I should give credit to the free alcohol I enjoyed before the film, but mostly the thanks goes to the film and its makers)Harrison Ford was phenomenal in the title role, and you could tell that during the last 19 years the character of Indiana Jones had lived on in his mind - it seemed effortless for him to be Indiana, again. Cate Blanchett, regardless of a bad haircut and an at times flaky accent, was also amazing. Shia LaBeouf was, to my surprise, one of the best things in the film. I'm already waiting for sequels with him in the lead. Karen Allen, my favorite Indiana girl of all time, is also back in the game and she is as lovely as ever. It's a shame she doesn't do more movies. The rest of the cast was very well chosen as well.I must say one last thing - Steven Spielberg's regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski did a great job of making Indiana just as it should be, even though it meant moving away from his own signature style.I encourage anyone and everyone to see this film, it is truly a gem.

2075,brianhoh,By far the worst Indiana Jones movie.,3,22 May 2008,"This is by far the worst of the Indiana Jones franchise. If one word can describe this movie it would be RIDICULOUS.The direction was good (but WHY STEVEN, why would you agree to do this movie?), but the writing/plot was god awful. The movie, without giving away the plot, lacked the magic that all the other Indy movies portrayed so effortlessly. There were comedic elements to the movie, but lacking compared to the other Indiana Jones movies. I blame the production of this movie on George Lucas. He wrote the screenplay, and from what I understand PUSHED as hard as his juice in the industry could take him to have it picked up and released.I can see why they had such a hard time getting Harrison Ford to come back for this sequel, but they knew they could shovel us dirt, and we'd buy into it, seeing Harrison Ford in a fedora again.This movie is a stain on the franchise, and my heart, since my fondest childhood memories were going to watch the movie with my family when I was wee high.The movie is just plain bad. Don't let people fool you into thinking that your expectations were high just because the other movies were just that great.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2076,J-D-Jones,Not what you're expecting,1,22 May 2008,"I went to this movie open minded, and came away pretty disappointed. I think if you watched the original trilogy as a child, and it's stapled in your mind, you will feel the same way. It is not a horrible movie, it's just not the same. There are no outstanding stunt sequences, and they tried to darn hard to make it a comedy. A lot of it was pretty funny, but there were a lot of parts that made me cringe. Harrison Ford's age has absolutely no negative impact on the film, although Indiana Jones has absolutely no edge in this movie. In the other films you always thought in the back of your head, that he could be a bad mother f***er if pushed too far. His edge is gone in this film. I just hope they stop now.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2077,bblack-7,Shiniest Box of Dumb in the History of Cinema,3,14 July 2008,"I walked into this mess knowing about the mixed reviews, but had managed to avoid finding out any specific plot points. I knew there was an ""Alien/Area 51"" connection to the Crystal Skulls and that was about it. Even with understandable reservations about having an ""Indy Meets ET"" experience, I even took my seat a couple beers ready to accept the film on its own merits and willing to settle for a couple hours of ""Dumb Fun"". Unfortunately, DUMB walks in during scene 1 and then proceeds to kick the hell out FUN for the rest of the movie. This project is pretty much an embarrassment for all parties involved and if the character of Indiana Jones wasn't attached to it no one would hesitate to recognize it for the brain dead drivel it is. Biggest disappointment of the year easy.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2078,bulldog10454,Absolute Garbage...Shouldn't Be An Indiana Jones Movie,1,22 May 2008,"I'm tired of seeing all the 10/10s on here for this abomination, so here goes: this movie was awful! Seriously! I did not like it one bit! OK, now, I will admit, the acting was spectacular. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, and I'm a big fan of Shia LaBeouf, and both actors gave great performances. The stunts were great, and Harrison Ford never came off as old or feeble. Also, the camera work was good, and the CG looked really nice.However, none of these things matter if a movie has a terrible plot, which IJ4 had. I don't even consider it a plot, it's like a writer from every different genre of movie sat down and each wrote a bit of a script, then they threw them all into a hat and picked them out in the order they appear in the movie. The plot was hard to follow, and, by the end, nothing motivated you to follow said plot. Also, I don't consider this a spoiler, because it has no impact on the ending of the movie or really anything else in the plot, but the movie revolves around (don't read if you really think it will ruin the movie for you) aliens. Yes, aliens. It was in no way, shape, or form, believable, and made for many laughable parts of the plot. I think this was done for two reasons: to appeal to the sci-fi crowd, and to make use of CGI.I wanted to like the movie, I really did. But the terrible plot and laughable actions on the screen made it impossible. Also, I thought it might be salvageable, but the last 15 minutes just put the fork in this pile of garbage. For people who liked the first 3 movies, I really don't consider this movie done with the same formula as them, so don't be surprised when you think to yourself that it wasn't really a Jones movie.Also, I'd like to state that at the midnight showing I went to there was in no way, shape, or form a standing ovation, just lots of tired people trying to leave the theater after seeing this abomination. (Also, I'm not alone, the friends I went with to see it also agree that it was bad.)",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2079,bloodandmood,An Adventure Worthy of Indiana Jones,8,4 June 2008,"Ever since I can remember, I have been obsessed with the Indiana Jones movies, the adventure and excitement I felt watching my favorite movie: Raiders of the Lost Ark are some of my fondest memories. Needless to say, when Indy 4 came out, I was first in line. At first, I was unsure of what to think of this new addition to the family. But now, after two more viewings, I have come to enjoy this film very much.My ultimate goal in going to the cinema is to be entertained, Indy 4 is by far the most entertaining movie I've seen this year. Despite it's flaws, this is a well crafted and fun adventure flick. The story is a far fetched, but aren't all of them? The screenplay is actually pretty good, when you consider the overall intent of the film and mood therein. With all of this you'd think people would be satisfied, yet there are still people out there who nail their 95 theses on message boards across the Internet.Perhaps the biggest complaint against this film is the amount of CGI in contrast to the original films which used models, optical printers, and practical effects. It seems as though these people believe that originals were made in an intentionally ""old-fashioned way"", this simply isn't true. The first three films used what were top of the line special effects for their era. If CGI had been available in the 1981 there would have been CG ghosts coming out of the Ark. We seem to have been convinced now that CGI is a bad thing, but it's the industry standard, just as models and optical printing was in the 80s. If you go back and look at the originals films, the special effects aren't that great. The computer effects in Indy 4 are pretty damn good, my hat goes off to the ILM animators.I think the only reason why people were so bothered by the CG is because it was Indiana Jones, especially when you consider that in 1999 The Mummy was praised by it's CG, and it might as well have been an Indy film.Other issues people have raised were the believability of certain plot elements, like the refrigerator and the waterfall. The fact is that every Indy movie has had impossible moments, like using a raft as a parachute or jumping off a tank right as it goes off a cliff. It's the impossible made possible that make adventure movies so much fun. If you really want to nitpick about the survivability of ""X"" then you really shouldn't be watching an Indiana Jones movie. I will say that the Mutt/Tarzan scene was just plain unnecessary, but it took up less than 30 seconds of the film, so I am not too distraught. The same goes for the CG Prairie dogs.*SEMI-SPOILER*Even the Sci-Fi twist wasn't so bad, in fact when you consider the change in periods it seems appropriate. The first three films were set in the 1930s and followed the themes and moods of films and serials popular during the era. KOTC is set in the 1950s and is much akin to the adventure and sci-fi films common in the period. When you consider this, the change in themes is much less substantial.*SEMI-SPOILER OVER*Overall, despite some flaws, I rather enjoyed this film and I am honestly anticipating a sequel, there are a lot of places my favorite hero can still go.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2080,Achmed_Abdel_Salam,Betrayal!,8,22 May 2008,"I saw KOTCS yesterday and what should have been an awesome night to remember forever, turned out to be disillusioning, disappointing and embarrassing trip to a land of betrayal. (yes, the victim is Indy himself) Mr. Spielberg, Mr.Lucas, what the **** were you thinking?? Everything that I love so much about the original trilogy has been changed for the worse!! The humor, the action scenes, the dialogs, the style...I gave it 4 out of 10 simply because Harrison Ford is in it and wears his trademark outfit again!Plus, the music was good and the beginning of the movie was the only part that felt like an Indiana Jones adventure!

2081,RodBlondel,"RIP Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr (1981-1989)",4,24 May 2008,"Foolishly I was under the impression that I was to see a movie featuring the global exploits of childhood icon Indiana Jones. However, what I saw on screen was most definitely not part the cherished film series that has become beloved by the late generation X and early generation Y. What I saw instead was Harrison Ford playing a poorly written character parading around on screen mocking a role he has long forgotten. Unnecessary ham-handed special effects and stunts slopped on computer processed film placating to a new generation who is used to the ""EXTREME"". And then there were the aliens. A direct slap in the face of the fans of the previous films we have to watch as Indiana ""Evel Knievel"" Jones stoops to dealing with aliens. There was always the religious mythology and the occult but at least these things were based off of grounded history - stemming off of years of acceptance. Indiana Jones was always emblematic of the adventure film, and it never flirted too much with the other genres. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's entire premise is built and based on science fiction and uses this premise as a crutch. Then there are other gimmicks in the film, the return of Allen's character, the addition of LaBeouf's as Jones's son - even the logic and wit of Jones's discoveries and progression are ruined with muddled riddles, short expository sequences, and the inconsistence and unnecessary presence of Hurt's character. Gone are the dangerous booby traps that we've come to expect, the tongue-in-cheek has all been but watered down, even the turbulent romance traded in for an afterthought love subplot...RIP Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr (1981-1989) You were a good man.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2082,gacaulfield,A disappointment from start to finish,3,20 October 2008,"This movie was a complete and utter letdown from start to finish. As far as I'm concerned the first and third movie's were the best. 19 years for this? Spielberg and Lucas should be ashamed of themselves for putting out trash like this. Nothing about this movie reminded me of the original or third film. Aside from the way, way, way over the top action sequences they didn't give the film an element of seriousness like the previous films, this was like a bad copy of the Mummy sans the mummy. Getting back to the action sequences, yes there will always be an element of unbelievability but if the scene is done right it could work IE: From Raiders of the Lost Ark: the running from the boulder scene, the truck chase scene, and every other action sequence in the film, same goes for The Last Crusade. They needed to stick to the old serial adventures from the 40's and 50's (like they did with the 1st and 3rd film). None of the action scenes in this film were even close to believable. They should have researched a religious story pertaining to the bible, it worked in the first and third, I'm sure there's another good relic in the bible to track down. Notice how the second and fourth were about relatively unknown relics and both films were disappointing? It's because there's no element of mystique, ""wow, wouldn't it be cool to find the arc that Moses put the ten commandment tablets in?"" or finding the holy grail? I kept waiting for that old Indiana Jones movie feeling and it never came what a disappointment.God Awful.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2083,m-jones-4,Indiana Jones and the Phantom Menace.,6,23 May 2008,"Firstly I would say that this film is entertaining, but entertaining in the same way that Transformers was entertaining. Plot and character development have been replaced by bombastic action and MacGuffins galore.The film begins quite well, albeit with a really rather cynical attempt by Lucas to create an emotional attachment to the new film by allowing us into the mysterious warehouse from Raiders of the Lost Ark, indeed allowing us a glimpse of the Ark itself, just in case we weren't bright enough to know where we were.From here the film ambles along interestingly enough - although I suspect a lot of Americans who spent their life savings on nuclear bunkers in the '50's will no doubt be somewhat annoyed to discover they could have just bought a handful of fridges  with the idea of Jones being caught up in the witch hunts of the era being a interesting idea, obviously Lucas moves on from that without a second to blink. Indeed, there is another of the films many flaws. We are bombarded short ideas in the plot but are never given any time to think about them before we are whisked off to the next plot point. A case in point is the waterfall scene, where everyone dusts themselves off and calmly wanders onto the next scene.Harrison Ford was, as usual outstanding, if a little below his usual standards, Shia Lebeouf wasn't as appalling as I had suspected he would be, but again this was an aspect of the film which was a bit flabby and not entirely necessary - although I did like the idea that, as with his fathers hat, he is fairly obsessed with his hair. Cate Blanchett was, quite frankly, just a little odd in this film and the supporting cast were decent enough, if slightly annoying.But my real gripe; and it is a biggie; is that the finale of the film is utterly 100% barking mad. To anyone who suggests that you have to suspend your disbelief, I say nonsense. At what point do you think that fans of the original trilogy didn't suspend their disbelief at Indy hunting for the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail? I was more than happy to suspend disbelief, but there is something just not quite right about this film and its gone right over the deep end.Finally I would just like to enquire how Steven Spielberg could claim that this film harks back to traditional film making and has as little CGI as possible when the entire film was CGI? And as for the lighting, I've seen more professional lighting in porn.In all, it was an OK film, but Indiana Jones films should be a lot more than OK, they should be classics and unfortunately even without the impossible expectation, the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will never, ever be a classic.i'm giving it a 6, but 2 of those points are because Raiders is my favourite film.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2084,Cplnnnj,"OK, Just OK",7,28 October 2008,"I really wanted to like this movie. No, actually I wanted to love it. I love the three other films, I love Steven Spielberg, I love Harrison Ford, I even like Shia LeBoeuf. But this film is kind of a mess. The best part is the chase on the motorcycle in the first half of the film, which really captures the essence of the first films. But there is too much going on here, the action scenes just don't hold any punch, and the plot is utterly laughable. I mean, come on! Aliens? Cate Blanchett is a hoot, and only proves her talent is limitless. I know there is talk now about more films, but unless they get back to basics with this, leave it alone and move on.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

2086,parasoft,what happened indy?,5,26 May 2008,"Well, what can I say about this lackluster attempt to bring the iconic figure Indiana Jones back to the big screen? Hmm....not much.... I had such high hopes for this film but was sadly disappointed. Even from the beginning of the film I kept thinking to myself how terrible it was and had it been a different film, or perhaps just a different 'character' I would have walked out a few minutes into the film. It starts off with this terrible cartoonish appearance to all of the characters. I'm not sure who's responsible for the cinematography, but the overall feel of the imagery came off looking like a bad Dick Tracy movie. Every character, especially at the beginning of the film looked...for a lack of a better word...cartoonish. The dialog was terrible and Harrison Ford almost seemed uncomfortable from time to time. There was nothing engaging about the dialog. Every line seemed forced and utterly fake. Karen Allen looked like she was just along for the ride. In fact the only acting in the whole film worth a darn was Shia LaBeouf's. There wasn't a moment of tension in the whole film which led one to believe that Indiana Jones was safe in every situation no matter how dangerous it might be. There wasn't a bit of nervousness in Indy at any time throughout the film. I think the question the filmmakers should be asking themselves is if Indy isn't nervous why should the audience be? And let's not forget about the plot shall we. The only one delusional enough to come up with such an outlandish and ridiculous plot is Georg Lucas himself. Indiana Jones is not Star Wars and was never meant to be. Yet Lucas insisted on including the alien theme into an already great franchise that needed no additional science-fiction fantasies. What made the past Indy films great was the filmmakers' ability to direct a story that was grounded in fact with a hint of fantasy thrown in at the right times. The quest for the holy grail, that was a great story line. Based on fact and at the right moment a tiny bit of fantasy thrown in (as we see a cup of water cure a bullet wound in Sean Connery). That was a great movie. That was a great story. Those were great actors. But this...no, this can't be Indiana Jones....",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2087,vynn007-1,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Unfortunate Icon Destruction,3,25 May 2008,"In 1989 when I watched the credits roll at the end of The Last Crusade, I hoped against hope that we'd see Indy again. Though I was much younger than some of the ""professional"" critics who actually do this for a living, even I knew that the film had nothing to do with some misconceived idea that it was actually the final Indy adventure, and everything to do with that it was literally the last of the original Christian crusades to find the holy grail. To my recollection, there was talk as early as 1990 of a possible fourth film.Unfortunately for those of us who are beloved of a certain fedora wearing archaeologist, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an absolute nuclear bomb. Just as an early scene where Indy finds himself trapped in a nuclear test town somewhere near Area 51, where the government has stored many priceless and powerful artifacts (one of which happens to be the Ark of the Covenant), falls flat, so does a huge portion of this immensely disappointing mess of a film. Indiana Jones shouldn't be some throwaway hero these writers can destroy. In this case though, said writers clearly don't remember that Indy is a legend and should have been treated as such. This film wouldn't hurt nearly as much if there wasn't such a legacy behind our whip-wielding professor.The problems begin very early on, when Indy first speaks in fact. Because after he utters his third or fourth line, not ten minutes in, we realize that Harrison Ford apparently can't remember how to be Indiana Jones and that the writers have forgotten how Jones even speaks. In this film, Indy emits dialogue in a way we know he never would and he sounds completely unnatural and uncomfortable doing it. Then, as we move on and just start to get over the poor opening during a pretty effective warehouse escape scene, we're treated to the horrible nuclear test town scene. Here, in an attempt to be funny, the film makers try way too hard and fail miserably at even presenting a believable or, heck, even sensible dilemma. There is absolutely no reason for Indiana Jones to be stumbling around a nuclear test site somewhere in the vicinity of Area 51! There's even less reason for him to look incredibly clumsy and inept, shouting things like: ""Oh sure, don't wait for me"" to some escaping soldiers as he does so.Though we are treated to a decent scene of Professor Indy teaching his class at the mainstay University and an interesting look into what has happened to friends from the first three films at Indy's house, we soon devolve into what I can only assume is parody and self-mockery arrived at on purpose! One scene in the jungle has Indy and a long lost love sinking into what Indy says isn't quicksand. Indy then tries to explain to Mutt Williams (Shia LaBouf) what the difference is and Mutt silences him. The comedy is supposed to come when we the audience realize that Indy is acting more like his father in trying to over explain rather than the normal decisive hero we all love who would work to get himself out of the situation. At one point earlier on, Indy actually says to his crew that ""This is intolerable"" after Mutt initiates their escape. I thought it was cute that they were hearkening back to a phrase Indy's father used, until I realized that they were inexplicably taking away Indy's natural ability to save the day. Then, just when we think it can't get any more disrespectful of Indy and the film franchise, Mutt grabs a snake in order to pull Jones to safety. The hilarity ensues when Indy can't grab this makeshift ""rope"" because it's, well, a snake. It's downright silly and should have never been approved. After three films we know Indy has a phobia of snakes which we've been shown very well, we certainly don't need this slap in the face to remind us.Soon we're treated to a pretty well conceived chase scene in the jungle, complete with jeeps and trucks and machine guns and swords and, hey look, swinging action! Too bad the swinging isn't the good kind. For most of the way, the whole sequence makes it on it's own as an exciting action/escape type sequence where all the characters are trying to lay their hands on the MacGuffin. That is, the Crystal Skull. You can just think of the skull as, well, the plot point of little or no meaningful or believable significance from now on. But, just when you think we're actually gonna get out of this sequence without any silliness, the swinging begins. When, like Tarzan, in the single worst effects sequence in the movie, Mutt Williams, in order to catch up with the battle on the vehicles, swings through the trees on vines...with monkeys! Not only is the CGI horrendous here, but the monkeys follow Mutt back to the battle and then commence attacking the villains, as if they knew who the villains were or would have cared anyway.The end of the film leaves us wondering what the finale even meant and why we're sitting in the theater in the first place. Sure, Indiana Jones is back some of the time, but the times when he isn't are simply...intolerable! Most of the scenes are connected in such a trivial manner or none at all and it feels like a disjointed collection of ideas that one or more writers felt would be cool to have Indiana Jones take part in. Too bad no one had any good ideas on how to get him there. So after 19 years and hoping against hope that our hero would return, some of the greatest fans are left wishing he really hadn't, at least the small part of him that really did anyway.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

The movies are about entertainment and this movie is entertaining, I think the people who are disappointed by this movie are let down by their own expectations. The action and the dialog run a bit like a comic book, but if you have ever watched the other three Indiana Jones movies, they are exactly the same in form. I think it is a wonder that they have achieved a new movie in this series that follows the other movies and yet develops Indiana Jone's life and character believably with regard to the context of his world.

Also to the people who are complaining about the Russian accent, I think they missed the point. This movie isn't trying to be serious, it knows its an adventure movie, the accent is deliberately over the top. Just like the German accents in previous Indiana Jones movies.I detest Shia Lebouf, but I have to grudgingly admit he did an alright job here. The special effects were really good, they were overblown but it fitted with the plot so it works. The plot is easy to follow but I'm not sure why they took that direction with the story. It's not as good as the earlier movies in the series but even that is still amazing.If you go into this movie expecting something with a serious message, you will be let down. If you go to see an action packed adventure movie with mild humour which is deliberately cartoonish at times then you're in for a hell of a ride.

2090,briannerene,The content doesn't matter - This is just a poorly made film,3,23 May 2008,"I went to an early screening, and I was 50/50 on if I was excited about it or not. I enjoyed the Indiana series in my youth, and I like Harrison Ford, but I just feel like they should leave the old franchises be. I was however with my friend who was extremely excited to see the movie... He feel asleep for the middle part, that's how slow and bad this was.There are lot of people upset about the alien theme, and I agree, it didn't really work for me. It gave them an easy way to fill in the gaps they had, and actually caused more holes. I still have no idea if the aliens were good, bad, or indifferent. (Or maybe by then I was so removed from the movie I wasn't paying attention) That aside however, this movie just wasn't put together very well. The entire film I felt they were trying to force me to get something I already got in the beginning. It made me feel that either the characters were all extremely stupid, or Lucas and Spielberg thought that we were.The dialog was just atrocious. I mean, I know Indie films are a bit hokey anyway, but it was in a good way in the past. This was just bad. Or maybe it was the same, and the style just didn't hold up over time. Regardless, the actors didn't have a whole lot to work with. The diner fight scene was ridiculous. ""Get that greaser!"" Really? If they were trying to be funny, it just came across as silly.Yes, this movie is going to have nostalgic value (that's why it I didn't give it a 1), but I can't believe it deserves as high a rating as I see here.

The action was dumb, real dumb, falling down 3 gigantic waterfalls in a car and everybody is fine. It was like a bad Three Stooges skit. Nothing looked dirty or real. The plot was ridiculous and the editing made the movie stumble badly. I can't believe this came from Spielberg, what an idiot. He needs to take a breathe and stop rushing through movies.

2093,perashaman,Disappointing Digital Disaster,4,22 May 2008,"I grew up loving the Indiana Jones series. It was an action packed trilogy that had an interesting and charismatic main character, well developed plots that always flirted with the edge of reality, and great action scenes. The acting was rarely brilliant, but it was always gritty and fun.That being said, if you want some cheap thrills and generic action, and if you have never seen one of the original Indiana Jones movies, this movie might be tolerable.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a complete and utter disaster. Although it had been widely spread that Steven Spielberg, with his old school mentality, would not succumb to the pressures of creating a special f/x laden blockbuster film with the new Indy, instead the viewer is given a CGI riddled nightmare. The effects in and of themselves weren't bad at times, and there was some fairly exciting scenes certainly, but ones that didn't fit in the style of Indiana Jones at all. Unfortunately a lot of the action sequences were just ridiculously unrealistic and campy. I understand and appreciate suspension of disbelief in the theaters, but there were some parts that were absolutely atrocious. They turned a good gritty action adventure series that focused heavily on plot and characters into a digital sci-fi monstrosity. And all the cutesy scenes with the animals? Come on, Spielberg, don't patronize the fans who have been following this series for 20+ years just to get some easy bucks from younger crowds.The acting was pretty awful. I was expecting Shia to be somewhat of a detraction, but I found him to be one of the more interesting characters, although that isn't really saying much. Harrison Ford was wooden, and he seemed to be just phoning it in. Cate Blanchett, an actress I normally like, does a horrible Russian accent. It's incredibly over the top and she still slips back into her normal British mid-sentence several times throughout the film. And rather than taking the time to redo the scene and get the accent consistent, the entire production seemed to say, ""Good enough."" And that is the most frustrating thing about this movie. It seemed on all parts to be just an effort to knowingly make a mediocre movie with a mediocre script for the money. I'm trying hard not to let this one detract from my love for the real Indiana Jones movies.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2094,Wratts,Excellent sequel.,10,28 May 2008,"As soon as you see ""Dr. Jones"" get slapped backhand by one of the bad guy thugs, you realize it's the same sound effect you've heard in the previous Indiana Jones movies.Sb-DAP! I can't reproduce it in typing, but suffice to say it almost got a tear of nostalgia out of me. That, and many other references and stabs at the older Indiana Jones movies (including a small reference to the Young Indiana Jones series!) made me feel right at home with this movie.And of course, the same style of story-telling, complete with over-the-top and absurd action scenes, crawling through the ruins of ancient civilizations and caves, creepy insects and angry savages, anachronistic mash-ups, and a nut-job nemesis who serves an oppressive regime only to pursue her own gonzo obsessions, employing an unlimited supply of henchmen and weapons.Even the intro is *insane*.Everything is overdrawn and blown out of proportion, and that's why---to me---it's a worthy sequel in all respects.I was skeptical about Shia and Cate appearing in this movie, but they didn't disappoint me.At all.In the contrary, they played two characters which fit seamlessly into the setting, and they did a good job about it. Obviously, an excellent job was done on the casting, because the same could be said about everybody who appeared in the movie (except for the cameo of Neil Flynn... nothing against him but I can't help thinking of a certain ""Janitor"" from a certain hospital when I see him and hear his voice---but that was so short that I can act like I missed it).In contrary to Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, and more along the lines of The Temple of Doom and the computer adventure game The Fate of Atlantis, this movie---Kingdom of the Crystal Skull---again takes a departure from Judeo-Christian myths and goes other directions. This could be considered a bad thing, but I was thrilled about it, and found it to be a great choice on behalf of the makers, and surprising enough to warrant its feature in an Indiana Jones installation.Perhaps my view is skewed by the fact that I've seen all three preceding Indiana Jones movie, and skewed by the fact that I totally dig pulp adventure stories in that vein. But these two facts are what sold me on the movie, they were what the trailer had promised me, and they were *exactly* what the movie delivered.It's that simple: if you loved the original movies, you're probably going to like KotCS. If you're expecting more than the original movies, you'll naturally be disappointed---how can you best the best? Watch the first three movies, get into the mood, expect nothing spectacular, and enjoy the show!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2095,smitty9-2,People need to relax its not a 1 or a 10,6,14 June 2008,"Crystal Skull achieves - mostly - what Spielberg and Lucas set out to do; create an entertaining, watchable popcorn movie.Those reviews from people giving it a score of <2 clearly had completely unreal expectations. Nothing could ever capture the magic of Raiders of the Lost Ark (recall best pic nominee)- although Last Crusade come fairly close. For the people complaining about how preposterous this film is, well let's do a quick review shall we; 1) Raiders with scenes of the ""wrath of God"" and melting faces, 2) Temple of Doom and the ripped out heart, 3) Last Crusade with the 1000 yr old immortal knight, 4) Crystal Skull with its inter-dimensional aliens, nuclear blast, etc?Folks, the films are all absurd on some level. Yeah, you could argue that Crystal Skull takes it to a new level, but so what? Were you really that surprised? If so, you forgot to check your expectations at the door. If you want ""grittier"" action scenes, go watch any of the ""The Bourne...(fill in the blank)"" series.No, the real problem with this film is the weak/cheesy ending overall, the lack of crackle and energy (seemed tired in spots) and too many characters. Marion (Karen Allen) was pretty disappointing. Hardly any spunk at all. Not nearly the same chemistry with Harrison from Raiders - not even a scintilla. And yeah, I have to agree with others, I mean c'mon, they took 19 freakin' years to come up with this script? Seriously? They honestly could not have done better than this script?Having lowered expectations helped (if you want bitterness, talk to me about Episodes I and II from Star Wars). Try watching the opening scenes with a wry grin on your face, trust me, you'll probably like this film more than it deserves.But overall, the film made me laugh, amused, and yeah, groan. But you know what? For 2.5 hrs I forgot about the real world, and that kind of escapism is fine with me.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2096,jackdennos,"An unnecessary sequel that can be shockingly awful at points, but offers up more than a few of it's own memorable and entertaining elements.",4,18 October 2017,"The frustrating part about Indiana Jones 4 is that it feels like it was written by someone who created a genius trifecta of revolutionary action classics that changed the course of film history, and then completely forgot what made people like them when it came time to do the next film. Was this written by George Lucas? Oh, it was (real surprise). He is credited as coming up with the story, and, yeah, the basic framework of the script really is the worst part. The original film was inspired by 30's adventure serials, and although it doesn't parody or satire them, it creates a world in which the events of the story can be taken with a grain of salt, so to speak. This world was successfully recreated in two masterful sequels, but the fourth movie had no idea how to do so. It results in an overly emotional and sentimental movie that occasionally devolves into self deprecation, making jokes about Harrison Ford's age. And the idea to base it off of 50's sci-fis while still retaining the 1930's action edge makes no sense. I mean, what? However, Spielberg, the other half of the duo of series creators, absolutely knows what he is doing. I imagine Lucas as Spielberg's drunk friend who makes dumb choices, and then Spielberg half-reluctantly supports him. If George is going to come up with a stupid story line, Steven is going to direct the sh*t out of it. He creates a visually appealing, tonally satisfying (even though the script tries not to be) experience, filled with fun performances, great dialogue and spectacular action. Janusz Kaminski is the perfect cinematographer for an action movie like this, because he is great at pulling off one of Spielberg's signatures: really long takes that seamlessly move from focal point to focal point without the use of cuts. The camera kind of floats around and is almost always moving, reminiscent of many Robert Zemeckis movies. The action is always striking, even the oft-panned fencing duel between Shia LaBoeuf and Cate Blanchett. I actually like that scene, and I think it would have totally fit in one of the originals. Another thing that I like about Kingdom that most don't is Shia himself. He gives a very natural and funny performance. I don't even have an ""except"" or ""but"" to counter that statement with. I just think he is great, and probably gives the best performance in the movie. I like his character a lot, actually, and his interactions with Indy, who is once again pure gold. The characters are all well developed, but the only one I can't stand is Mac. He is the most utterly confusing character I have ever bared witness to. He is revealed to be working for the Russians, and is a secondary villain for well over half the movie. Suddenly, after a short encounter with Jones, where he pathetically begs him for sympathy, he is allowed into their vehicle and completes the journey back on their side. What the heck? There is pretty much no reason for this to happen, and then he turns evil again at the end! He is then sucked into a vortex and Indy tries to save him (I don't know why), to which he says ""I'm gonna be alright."" What? No you're f*cking not! He then flies into the vortex, screaming, and dies. This is one of the most baffling characters in film history. He doesn't have an arc, he has more of a loop-de-loop. While on the topic of baffling, awful things in Kingdom, I should touch on the monkey sequence and the nuketown sequence. They are both completely pointless to the story, they both defy all logic, and one of them (the monkey one) is absolutely awful looking. I'm really ragging on this movie, but I don't hate it, not at all. I would actually recommend it, at least for Spielberg. There's a couple bad scenes, as well as a somewhat confusing story line. They don't ruin this extremely well directed, acted and put-together movie, although they certainly don't help.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2097,genaldar-1,Why was Ox a chump?,2,26 June 2008,"The movie was bad, but the thing that bothered me the most was why was Ox an idiot? The way his character was described was not only as Mutt's mom's boyfriend (sorry I forgot her name because she was so painfully written and the acting had the charm of a corpse) but as a surrogate father to Mutt. But in the end he rolled over and let Indy take his woman and his kid. What a farking maroon. And the fact that Mutt was Indy's son, Jesus who didn't see that coming? This movie made me HATE Shia LeBouf, before I was just didn't give a shite about him. But now I don't think I'll be paying to see any of his movies. Ditto Harrison Ford (granted the last thing of his I saw in a theater was a long long time ago).",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2098,Bond1123,"Maybe not as great as the originals, but entertaining by all means",8,24 May 2008,"Honestly, I went into this with little expectations yet excited all the same. I've loved Indiana Jones since I was a kid, and this fictional man has become a life influence, as sad as that may sound. But as I said, I came in with little expectation mainly due to the fact that Lucas' work has been rather questionable these past few years and I feared in the back of my head that Indy would be ruined for me.But fortunately, this was not the case.************SPOILERS START HERE, READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION************I absolutely loved the first half of the movie. It contained the same Indy feel while putting him into a new decade. When the doors with ""51"" on them opened and the familiar boxes from ""Raiders"" came to light, I just laughed because I couldn't believe I never thought of the Ark being there (really, where else would the US government put it?). The classic action was back, along with the usual ""absurd yet entertaining Indy survival moment"" that was the nuke blast. Like the original three represented the '30s serials, KOTCS gives a great feel for the 1950s. The nuke blast, commie rallies, ""I like Ike"", Indy thinking of expatriating...all of that was great.The second half didn't go down as well, but it was still fine. Really, only two things had me upset: 1) The monkey vine-swinging scene was too stupid to be one of those cheesy yet acceptable Indy moments and 2) While I didn't hate the situations with the aliens, the ""skull invades Indy's mind"" thing was a bit too much. If those two bits were taken out I'd put this movie on par with ""Temple of Doom"" (which I love by the way, but by default is third best when put up against the other two in my opinion), but alas, I'm not Lucas or Spielberg, so my complaining will stop here. Anyways, the jungle chase was absolutely crazy (besides monkey-Shia, but even then I guess it's worth a laugh to some) and the ending, though very very strange, was fine by all means. Oh, regarding the CGI... I have no idea what people are complaining about, it was fine. Nothing spectacular, but no complaints about it here. I guess being a history/archaeology buff made me enjoy this movie a bit more than others. I loved all the subtle references to the previous movies and real history. To some of you reading this right now it may surprise you that I insist this fact let me in the very least be ambivalent towards the aliens. For one, alien hysteria was huge in the '50s due to Roswell and Sputnik (which, fyi, was launched the year this movie takes place, adding more to this dimension). Besides that, this movie took the Indy ""what if"" vein but put it into the ideas of pseudoscience and those crazy guys on the history channel everyone loves to make fun of, with their theories of how our race was jump-started by extraterrestrials and whatnot. It made me delve into those ideas for a two hour span, and honestly, it was a lot of fun thinking along those lines for a bit.*******************************END SPOILERS***************************** In all, you have to realize this movie is by no means meant to surpass ""Raiders"". Really, all the Indy movies are absurd in one way or another, but that's what makes them great. These movies allow you to get lost in your imagination and enjoy yourselves for a while, something we take for granted nowadays. KOTCS did just that, and I thank the crew of this movie for that in light of the utter crap Hollywood has been putting out recently. I'm sure that ""Temple"" and ""Crusade"" were panned just as much back in the day, but look at them now. I guess only time will tell with this one, but in my opinion when this movie is put into the proper context it does its job well.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2099,cameronwarn,Oh well.. at least my original box set can't be ruined by Indy 4,1,23 May 2008,"Another in a list of very poor Hollywood follow-up films.....For a film where the makers continually talked of doing in-camera effects so as to match the original films and preserve continuity, there sure were a lot of CG effects. In fact, the very first shot of the film includes a CG character which served to me as a warning as to how the whole film was going to go.There are so many things wring with this film Its difficult to know where to start. The story for starters is a bit weak, and surely they could have found a non extra-terrestrial theme and picked something more interesting and based on some other interesting artifact from antiquity. Ford's character having a side career as a spy was ridiculous, as was the terrible character played be Blanchett. In fact, all of the characters were simply uninteresting and a waste of time for the actors who portrayed them.The action sequences seemed a bit old-hat and it was painfully obvious at times (such as the warehouse sequence) that Ford was a little over the hill for the role as the difference between his close-ups and the stunt-mans shots whose tempo did not match. Throughout the film there were several shots that do stand out in my mind, but maybe not for good reasons. Some of these included that ridiculous sequence with the fridge, the very 'Mummy' like ant effects, the awful shot introducing Shia LaBeouf, those stupid monkeys and gophers and probably most notably the dime store looking, cling-wrap filled plastic skull which was meant to be what the whole film was about!!For some reason Hollywood does not seem to be able to produce any decent follow-up films recently, and this is no exception. I can only wonder at how much influence Lucas had over the filming and post production of this film, but it really feels like 'Phantom Menace Syndrome' with its lack of story, character development, style, excitement or any virtue worth going to see an adventure film for. It simply is not anything like the original 3 films which were great fun to watch and still are. The direction of the film feels like a first time director who does not know where the film is going and simply cannot get a grip on the material. It disappoints me greatly that this film is so woefully dull, as with its great cast and director it really was the last thing that I would have expected. There are a few nice moments between Ford and Allens characters, but these are counted in low single digit numbers. The films greatest crime is that is just not a fun film. I personally don't think of an CG driven film when I think of this franchise but this is what they gave us this time and quite frankly, I would rather go watch The Mummy for that kind of film and its certainly no piece of art either!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2100,menellom,"Well, I learned my lesson...",4,23 May 2008,"... Never trust Spielberg and Lucas not to **** up another franchise (at least they're both running out of franchises).Alright, to be fair, the movie wasn't terrible. Hell, the first third of it was fantastic! The first sequence in the warehouse was both suspenseful and exciting, in true Indiana style, and the first real car chase sequence with Harrison and Shia had my eyes locked on the screen...But the second the duo gets off the plane in Peru, the film starts spiraling downward. In just a few short moments the film shifts from ancient legends and golden cities... to aliens and stories straight out of space operas. The mythology of ancient pantheons, religious relics, and deified artifacts is replaced with ET and a Soviet quest for psychic weapons in the Cold War.I'll admit that during the downward crash there were a few moments that briefly lifted my hopes, most notably the bit with Ford and the snake... but it seemed like as soon as the movie shifts to South America, Spielberg is on a quest in each scene to outdo the sheer ridiculousness of the scene before. In one action sequence alone Shia goes from being in a sword fight suspended between two cars (getting needlessly hit in the crotch, much to low-brow delight), to (film gods save us) vine-swinging through the Amazon with a pack of monkeys, to outrunning a pathetically CGI'd swarm of Siafu ants that look like something ripped right out of The Mummy (speaking of ripoffs; was I the only one who noticed Spielberg's pathetic self-praising by ripping the alien model directly out of Close Encounters of the Third Kind?). In the end, we're left with El Dorado being an inter-dimensional spacecraft, Blanchett bursting into flames... for some reason, and Ford getting a sappy; ""getting married and living happily ever after"" ending that is so completely unlike the style of ""Raiders"" that it makes me wonder how long Spielberg spent goading Lucas into making this.The movie has it's moments, and in all honesty it could have been worse than it was... but I'm being extremely generous when I say this: Wait till it's a rental!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2101,mrcinecine,"George was right, It's not the one I expected",7,22 May 2008,"The beginning is cool,the car chase scene is well done but has too much useless scenes like the one with the monkeys,the one with giant Ants (remind me the poor""The Scorpion King"" opening sequence with the Rock""), and i'm also ""disappointed by the cinematography because obviously too much Janusz Kaminsky and not enough Douglas Slocombe,and the End sequence with the E.T. is seems to be escaped from another movie than an Indiana Jones Movie. For me CG it's not a problem when it's a questions about landscape but the ""monkeys sequence with Shia"", i still can't swallow that.I was hoping something between ""Raiders"" & ""The Temple of Doom"" my two favorites even if George & Steven and most of you are not agree with my opinion.Both of For their Great Opening sequences. The first one (Raiders) for its seriousness subject and believable story, the bar sequence in Nepal, the duel in the street of Cairo, the car chase. About the second one (Temple of Doom) for the wagon chase at the end, the chain bridge,the trap with all the insects and despite a very simple story,This ""Temple of Doom"" is so fun and it's like a big roller coaster. About the Crystal Skull, I'm also disappointed by the fact that all the characters in this movie call Indiana Jones by His real Name Like Dr Jones, Or Jonessy, or Henry Jones Jr, I think not once i heard ""Indiana"", maybe i'm wrong but if i'm right that proves that Indy has lost his identity, his flavour and the essence that makes this Trilogy (the 3 first not this one) magic. Also the Waterfall sequence is almost boring because we've seen something similar in the the Temple of Doom. Except all those negative points, the movie is still great fun much Better than the other movies of the same genre(like National Treasure or The Mummy)and of course As a real fan of ""Indy"", I'm very disappointed by the wrong direction, this one goes. And I Don't Blame Steven Spielberg for this, because he told George that he didn't want Indiana Jones with The Little Green Men"" because he have just recently done ""War of The World"", produced ""Men In Black ""and previously ""E.T"" and ""Close Encounter of The Third Kind"" and People even blame him for the end Of ""A.I."" because of the Exta-Terrestrial sequence which is in fact Robots of the future generation. but the look of these robots definitely looks like E.T.s because Kubrick Wanted like This. Here it's same, the Story is because of George Lucas and not Because of Steven, He just tried to write this script the best way possible with David Koepp. But It's sad to not see the Frank Darabont's version.

2103,danninbham9,Indy is Back: My Review,10,22 May 2008,"My Review: 8/10""I hope they make another Indiana Jones. That was pretty good.""I heard that comment from a young boy (maybe 10?) while I was walking out of a screening of the incredibly fun, entertaining, and nostalgic Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. About halfway through watching a pre-screening of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I had this big stupid grin on my face. I was watching the first Indiana Jones movies in 19 years. Wow. I couldn't believe it. And on top of that, it actually FELT like an Indiana Jones movie. Big action, a few laughs, some old friends, some new ones. As the movie ended and the lights went up, there was a nice round of applause (though not loudly) and some hummings of the Raiders March. I found myself even humming along. While Indy may be older, there is still some magic with the man in the hat. OK, now that the obligatory intro is out of the way, on to the review! First, I'd like to point out my initial impressions of the movie:1) Die-hard Indy Purists (including myself): Leave any lingering thoughts you have about Raiders at the theater doors. To expect something even reaching that level of excellence would be proving Lucas right. You did expect the 2nd Coming.2) This movie is without a doubt the 3rd best in the series. It combines the fast paced action and minor plot details found in Temple and the laughs, but interesting story in Crusade. My brother found this to be better than Temple. I disagreed and said it was just a little better than Crusade. Just my opinion. But who knows? As Ebert said, how can you rank good ""sausage?""3) Stars Wars/Indy fans can rest easy: Lucas did not rape your childhood again. At most, as I saw a review put it, Lucas ""is making lewd comments to you in a public restroom."" The touchy feely hands of George Lucas are few and far between. Most (75%) of the action oriented sequences are done with either Matte backgrounds or traditional stunt work. Apart from the prairie dogs, Mutt's monkeys, and the bloated finale, Lucas doesn't really feel like he had much influence in the film. That's not to say that there isn't CGI. There is. But most of the action is old fashioned and welcomed and the CGI is done pretty well and much better than the CGI shown in the Hulk previews.4) Harrison Ford is 65. Harrison Ford can still kick bad guy ass. Enough said.5) Spielberg's magic is still there. The panorama silhouette of Indy looking at the atomic blast is cinema glory. It's an amazing scene. The motorcycle scene is reminiscent of the Last Crusade and the Jungle Chase is probably the best in the series next to the Raider's Truck Chase. The editing and cinematography are superb. The script is bumbling at times, but Spielberg's direction helps right the ship.6) I'll admit it. The ending was a minor letdown. I expected Indy to somehow play a huge role towards the end. But for the last 15-20 minutes, he seems to become a bystander. Furthermore, I thought it would have been an excellent idea to have the aliens turn out to have religious ties or be of the earth. I will tell you this: The floating orb at the end does leave it up to the imagination. Were they really aliens/intergalactic travelers or just manifestations of supernatural powers like the Ark?Bottom Line: I suspect Crystal Skull will disappoint some longtime fans. We'll probably hear griping about the plot's science fiction leanings (even though it's no more outlandish than the Ark of the Covenant melting Nazis' faces, almost anything in The Temple of Doom or the everlasting life promised by the Holy Grail in The Last Crusade). No movie can live up to the hopes and expectations that have been building for 19 years. Throw those away and have fun.They say time blurs the line between nostalgia and reality. When Crusades came out, I left the theater with almost the exact same feeling I did with Skull. It was a pretty damn good movie. Not great. But damn good. And over time, Crusades has become endeared and one of my favorite films. Is it better than the 'pretenders' National Treasure, The Mummy, and Tomb Raider? Hell yes. Most Indiana Jones fans will probably say this is a pretty good movie, but only an above average Indiana Jones flick. I know. Expectations are high. But as for new fans? Well, let's just say they will be buying the trilogy and craving the next adventure of Dr. Jones. And in the meantime, I'll be adding this welcome film to my Indiana Jones Quadrilogy Collection.-danninbham9-",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

I was OK with the whole thing at first, no doubt.

At least the characters were good and the chemistry was there, Ford felt right in the role after all these years and even Blanchett was really cool as an Indy villain.My friends who were with me had the same feeling and when I looked around in the theatre I definitely saw some disappointed looks.

2106,acoustic_al2002,Awful,1,22 May 2008,"This is an absolutely awful film - so different to any of the original Indy films it is virtually unrecognisable. As well as a total lack of plot and characterisation, the reliance on CGI is embarrassing. Aliens flying away on a space ship; 5000-year old creatures jumping out of the woodwork; Indy and his crew falling hundreds of a feet down waterfalls and miraculously emerging unscathed; armies of giant red ants carrying enormous Russian soldiers into their ant-holes in seconds; Indy's son leaping through trees with monkeys like Tarzan...But despite all of this, by far the worst feature of the film is the lack of focus. It is less about Indy (Harrison Ford) than his upstart squirt of a son, who does nothing but irritate and get in the way.Is it just me or have Lucas and Spielberg, once the heroes of Hollywood, not only sold out but exploited a commercial opportunity in an extremely calculating way?",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

If you didn't grow up going to the wonderfully cheesy movies shown at the Saturday matinée, then I think you could easily miss the spirit of this. Yes, you can criticize the plot, the dialog, all the CGI, but it may help to compare this film to films of its own genre, and you need to go back to the 50s and early 60s for that.Kingdom of the Crystal Skull stands up very well if you make that comparison. The film rolls along in its own nutty time-frame, and, of all the Indy movies, it probably has the most human quality. There's a sweetness at the heart of this one - a ""fiftyness"" if you will - that isn't evident in the others.There are scores of references to other films; catching them is half the fun. There are easily a half dozen that even a casual moviegoer will find readily. Older viewers (and younger viewers who've seen a lot of old movies and TV) will see quite a few more.It helps if you can put yourself into your ""child"" mind, back before you knew how everything ""really"" worked.

The movie was completely unrealistic and awful. What makes a movie good is realism or the possibility of it being possible considering the movie constraints. What I mean is that in movies like say The Bourne Identity where 1 guy wins a gun fight verses 20 is unrealistic but because the movie is based on the underlining fact that Bourne is superior to normal people this make it possible that he would win verses 20 normal guys.

It has pace, the acting is generally very good, and it's well produced: the lighting and sound are good, and there are some spectacular action sequences. My main problem is with the plot. The series has never been about believability, with subjects such as the Ark of the Covenant (which was probably destroyed centuries ago) and the Holy Grail (which probably never existed). Nor is it inherently believable that Thuggee priests can remove the hearts from living people. However, in this film Spielberg and Lucas have gone too far, and ended up with a storyline that is ultimately ludicrous. This is a shame, because it's potentially a very good film, that is well shot and well executed. I came away feeling disappointed.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2112,fenderking,Terrible... disappointing... etc. etc.,3,28 December 2009,"Predictability aside i hoped that due to Indiana having the fan base that it did, someone along the line would not let this become what it is...this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen, unnecessary bit parts and side scenes instantly diminish the little plot line the film started with. many MANY historical and scientific inaccuracies even for a fantasy this is stupid... sure Shia Leboufe can swing through a dense rain forest and catch a speeding car!!!! and sure Indie can survive a Nuclear explosion inside a fridge without side effects and radioactive fallout... I'm sorry but PLEASE don't watch this film unless you like predictable, unbelievable rubbish!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull

2114,nato_25,"""Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?!?!?!""",6,28 May 2008,"First of all, people who are commenting on how ""rediculious"" the plot is, obviously do not remember the other three movies. So what there are aliens, in raiders of the lost arch there's a magic box, in temple of doom there are magic skulls, and in last crusade there is the magical holy grail, its a fictional action film. Now on to the movie. It begins with a strong plot, but i feel like they just had no clue how to end it. The action was great and exactly what to expect from Indiana Jones, however the dialogue stunk, and like i said it felt like when they got to the end of the script they had a brainfart. I would compare it to the fourth Rambo, where the dialogue and storyline kinda sucked, but the action is great. Don't give up on the movie though, because its still fun to watch on the bigscreen.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2115,ktkenshinx,"No Raiders, but a Good Addition Nonetheless",7,24 May 2008,"Anyone expecting to see Indy in his gritty, roguish role from Raiders will be sorely disappointed. He has gotten a bit more formal, a bit more straight, and a lot older. That being said, Spielberg and Lucas certainly give Indy plenty of young ones around him to tip the scale towards stunt packed spectacular. The current generation will enjoy this one, with its gaudy sets and ultra unbelievable sequences, although fans of old Indy may lament what has happened to their hero. As Indy says in the trailer, it's ""Not as easy as it used to be."" Ford, Allen, Spielberg certainly acknowledge this sentiment, and do what they can to bring back the old Raiders spunk. Shia and Cate are no Shortround and Beloque, but they bring a new type of energy to the series which younger viewers might appreciate; at least they give it their best shot, albeit in a modernized sense. And Lucas? While he definitely deserves credit for his early works and his creations, it is time for him to hang up his director's hat, and let Ford put back on the dirty, bloodstained fedora.When the movie works, it really works. The punches crack their way through the movie, and everyone wants to stand up and give the Indy haymaker to some evil sap. While computer animation dominates the primary chase scene in the movie, it is still a well orchestrated affair, mostly avoiding the silly and sticking with the serious. The plot itself works perfectly, especially given the era. By 1950, all the treasure in the world has been found. Planes are flying people everywhere, highways are shooting up, and the world is ready to settle down. Gone is the anxiety of the 30s, gone is the sense of the unknown that you can see in the Renaissance maps on Doctor Jones' wall in his home. Spielberg and Ford see this, and move to solve the unknowns that still remain. Historians will shudder at some of Doctor Jones' lectures, which remind me more of the ramshackle blundering of Doom at best, National Treasure at worst, than the deliberate illumination of Raiders and Crusades. But it is fitting for the 50s, and done in such a way and voice that even the most skeptical audiences will believe for two hours of their lives.Joining Indy on his post-mid-life-crisis romp is Shia, doing a fine job transcending just Shortround 2.0. He is better in a fight than Shorty was, has the wise cracks of both Sallah and Marcus, and his frustration with Indy is real. Young whippersnapper Shia is rough on old man Ford, and while the plot doesn't steam right into the ending, their relationship does. Mutt and Indy plausibly and enjoyably become better buds over the movie, and Spielberg is to be commended for making this work out. More importantly, a scene at the very end of the movie puts a brilliant cap on their interaction, and serves as one of the truly funny moments of the movie. On the other side of the ethical scale is Cate Blanchett. Remember the ""goose-stepping morons"" in the Crusades? Well, this is what happened to those that survived the 40s. If the native rabble and ubermensch Nazi's in the first three movies were the embodiments of the 30s serials, then the Red Army is spot on for the 50s. Yes, Cate and crew are a set of caricatures, but not much more than Dr. Schneider and Colonel Vogel were. What they lack in evil and brutality, they try and make up for in humor. And it succeeds, but only somewhat.And then there was the ugly. All the other complaints in this movie are valid, but the silliest sequences and least enjoyable parts can be chalked up to special effects. Everyone on earth knows that Lucas and his minions can play God all over again, and create a world with a few keystrokes. Had he saved this digital creationism for a more suitable work, I would be more impressed than upset. It does not quite belong in Indiana Jones. He is mostly guilty of CGI-crime in chase scenes and temple scenes. The problem is, the old school chase scenes and temple scenes were more compelling. That nameless temple at the beginning of Raiders looks Kingdom's temple look like a McDonald's play pen, and there were no computer effects there. At the end of the chase scenes in all three original movies, the audience feels Indiana's soreness. He is covered in bruises, his lip is split, and his sweaty clothes are torn. Compare Indiana at the beginning of the Raiders chase scene through the desert (Riding the horse on the ridge) with Indiana boarding the boat; you just feel tired looking at him. CGI has made these chase scenes sparkle, but Indiana is not a shiny guy. Gone is the grit of Nepal bar room battles with Nazi goons, brawls on top of a 1917 tank in the middle of a dusty valley. Everything just gleams a bit too much. Even the obligatory big bad guy death is not as satisfying as it should be. It's not even that gross. The same goes for the paranormal finale, which once had my jaw open and my body buried in my seat. This is not even a mistake that can be attributed to Indy entering the 50s. Some stuff should shine, but save it for stateside. The jungles and tombs should be as dirty as ever. Overall, it was not a bad movie, and if Spielberg can kick Lucas off the project, I would be happy to see an Indy 5. In the end, I was most happy to see that Indiana had returned, and old or not, Ford still had some of the good old sweat from the 70s and 80s.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2116,chesterules,almost perfect,10,22 May 2008,"I did not think Raider's was the best. But I may have not seen Raider's first. I think I actually saw Last Crusade or Temple of Doom first.. so long ago can't be sure tho. For awhile Temple was my fave. Then Last Crusade. Raiders is a classic, but it was never my fave. Most people's order goes like this: Raiders, Last Crusade, Temple. At least two critics on RT thought Cyrstal Skull was the 2nd best. I would agree, but time will tell if it remains in that spot, drops, or moves up. We forget that all the movies had flaws--weren't perfect. We forget we weren't 100% satisfied with them when we saw them at the time. We forget we poked fun at the films for their ""yeah right"" escapes and things the characters (mainly Indy) could survive. So since it's been so long and memories grow fonder with age, we want Indy 4 to be better than the previous 3 when there is no reason it should be, especially since Connery didn't stick around.Indy 4 is a great movie. It does nearly everything right. If Sean Connery hadn't been such a boob, the movie would have been really something--not just a reunion for fans, but a proper family reunion within the film. One of the best things about Indiana Jones was the dynamic between Sr. and Jr. But I think this film will age well. I think it has enough good stuff that people will look back on it and realize it is just as good as the others if not better.One reviewer did make the observation that the research part of the film was diminished slightly. I sort of agree with this, but it was remarkable to see Indy's old schoolboy enthusiasm as keen as it ever was. I do agree finding the temple was a bit too easy, and the whole research aspect was a bit to convoluted and confusing--which made it feel like it didn't quite have the same spark or excitement--but the mysticism is as strong if not stronger in this one than it was in Raiders and Crusade. One thing that may have made it seem too easy was the fact I wasn't able to follow what was going on. One other critique of the film would be there were some missed opportunities for better lines/more comical--where they chose to use a more generic line. The other critique would be the villains--they were less personal than the villains in Raiders and Crusade. There isn't the same sort of rivalry or personal dynamic that formed in Raiders and Crusade. But this was sort of a subtle thing--you may or may not experience it. Cate Blanchett didn't really do it for me.I am looking forward to seeing this film again because I really do think it is signature Indy and has its own special place within the canon. There's something special about the film. And while Indy's performance wasn't superlative, it was pure Indy. Harrison Ford has never been a faultless actor. He wasn't then and he isn't now and he as aged quite well. The film has had staying power with me which is a sign of a good film, but has left me with some questions I hope to maybe answer upon my second viewing. I think I may enjoy it more the second time round when things that confused me first time might be clarified. Some of the goofy aspects of the film actually enhanced it for me and didn't really feel goofy but just.. Indy, and felt fitting rather than being too silly or too over the top. CGI didn't really detract, but of course it would have been nice if they hadn't resorted to it quite so much, and we have to remember even Raiders had CGI! Another good thing about the film was that it really incorporated all the things memorable from the previous 3 movies. When I look back on all the movies, they really all have something that makes them great. For Temple, there was Short Round, the ongoing romance, and ""Humnumshivah."" In Raiders there was great sense of archaeological discovery. In Crusade there was the cool ending, the fun dynamic between Sr. and Jr. and more great archaeological uncoverings--and in Crystal Skull, there was mysticism, mystery and discovery surrounding the archeology, great action sequences, classic Indy charm and humor and a bad ass ending.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2117,neverbridge,"Oh dear, Oh dear, Oh dear",1,22 May 2008,"This film is the second to worst film I've ever seen in my entire life.From the opening sequences long, drawn out, pointless nods to Duel right through to an ending more at home in the X-Files, this film is a complete let down, with a script that feels like three films smashed together in the hope that it might become something special.The ""emotional"" scenes between Jones and Mutt fail to communicate any feelings or emotions at all and after the supposed ""big"" revelation that almost everyone should see coming a mile off the characters seem to adjust to the ""big"" news fairly quickly and with little fuss.Where-as the original films relied on a basic historical background and tense booby-trap laden sequences Kingdom seems to rely on lengthy chase sequences that are poorly shot and badly edited and the fact that some people might care about Jones in his later years... which I do... if it wasn't so damn tedious with poorly written humour.And now for the main spoiler... seriously... aliens in an Indy film, what were you thinking. I find it hard to believe that at no point in the film's production someone didn't stand up and say ""errr, Guys, this is a really bad idea, what are doing?!"". After years of script development surely they could've come up with something better than this nonsense that just reeks of poorly thought out ideas.And another thing how can Indy stop off in Havana Cuba on his way to South America when Cuba is a communist country and he's apparently being watched by the FBI who disappear from the film as soon as they say ""we'll be watching you""??If I hadn't paid £6 to see this travesty of a film I would've walked out half way through muttering something along the lines of ""I didn't think it could be worse than temple of doom but I was wrong, what have they done to Indy?"" Please... if you do one thing with your life, I beg you, avoid this film.Oh, and if you were wondering, worst film I've ever seen... Bend It Like Beckham... just... nasty.",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
2118,Atomsuperaffe666,Meet the Jones,6,23 May 2008,"Hi, I just saw the movie yesterday and I think it was all right. It wasn't really the reinvention of the series but I think Spielberg did kind of a good job in moving the setting to the 50s and portraying an older Indy during the McCarthy era. I think the essential prerequisite to enjoy the movie is the willingness of the viewer to accept, that the framework of the Series has absolutely changed within this fourth installment. As already stated in other comments, the focus of the movie is a total different as in the original series, as they were homages to the thirties adventure Stories, while the new (but older...) Indy stands clearly in the tradition of Science Fiction Trash Movies like Formicula or invaders from Mars and therefore the movie steadily cites clichés from that period: Area 51, ALiens, Ants, Commies, you name it, you get it. I personally found that the atmosphere of this setting was quite amazing, but this is a matter of taste. The biggest surprise of the movie is by far Shia, as he definitely IS the son of Indiana Jones, good job, kid. Cate Blanchett is a fantastic villain, even if the character is not as menacing as for example Major Toth or Mola Ram and Ray Winstone's role is just unnecessary, as he is just the chubby guy who's changing sides every two minutes and has a crush on gold, very poor! It's really nice to have Marion back, but is she really there? She's got a few good lines when she's introduced, but for the rest of the film she's just decoration which does not suit her very well (the script even interdicts her to have one single drink! Marion Ravenwood!) The biggest problem is, as one of my predecessors in this forum already stated, that it is not a true Indy Movie, because he is overshadowed by so many (And sometimes totally unnecessary) side-characters. Thereby you can easily get the impression, that this movie should be better entitled ""Indiana Jones and his family and the kingdom of the crystal skull"" or ""Meet the Jones while they make a journey to the kingdom of the crystal skull... Even if Shia is doing an awesome job, more Indy please!!!! But after all, it was quite enjoyable, even if this is clearly the worst of all the four films. But nevertheless, I will not regret that I went to the cinema, as KOTCS was the first Indy film i watched on the big screen, anyway. When I was twelve, I wanted to see Last Crusade, but my Mom told me to take my little brother along with me, and he insisted to watch ""The gods must be crazy part 2"" and started such a mess that I finally agreed... Ahhhrg!",Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
