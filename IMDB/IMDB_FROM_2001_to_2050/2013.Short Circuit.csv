0,Leofwine_draca,Beloved children's classic still holds up today,7,24 December 2015,"SHORT CIRCUIT was a childhood favourite of mine back in the 1980s and I'm pleased to see that it still holds up for modern viewers. This is the kind of well-plotted, action-packed family fare that gets by on physical effects and well-filmed action sequences, rather than boring and tired CGI scenes. The choice of making Johnny 5 a physical model was a very good one as you never question the believability for a second. Plus he's one of the most lovable robots ever put on screen, so there's that.Otherwise, the story is fairly typical for an '80s film. There's the 'outsider' heroine, played by Ally Sheedy, who goes on the run from the usual military-type bad guys who take ruthlessness to the extreme. G. W. Bailey plays EXACTLY the same role as his one in POLICE ACADEMY, and Steven Guttenberg is very similar to his part in that film too. Fisher Stevens gives the most memorable and funniest performance as the Indian guy; those who champion political correctness might question the use of 'brown face' but it's hard to dislike his constant malapropisms and his sheer good-naturedness.Otherwise, SHORT CIRCUIT proves to be a rollicking good time for all the family. There are fun references to classic movies, lots of cute animals, chase scenes, explosions, and a wonderful, western-style showdown. No crude or lowbrow humour in sight, but some nice throwaway jokes for adult viewers. Plus there's that ending, which will have any kid crying. The one reason this works though is that Johnny 5 is an extremely endearing protagonist, and would return in the even better sequel, SHORT CIRCUIT 2.",Short Circuit
1,SnoopyStyle,fun charming cute,7,4 January 2015,"In Oregon, Number 5 is one of the experimental military robots build by NOVA Robotics. When it gets hit by lightning, its memory gets erased and becomes self-aware. Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his assistant Ben Jabituya (Fisher Stevens) are its creator. It gets accidentally thrown out with the trash and gung-ho security captain Skroeder (G. W. Bailey) is sent to retrieve it. It lands on animal lover Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy)'s food truck. At first, she thinks it's an alien and Number 5 wants input. Eventually she contacts NOVA but it fears disassemble because ""Number 5 is alive."" Ally Sheedy is adorable and Steve Guttenberg is adorkable. Sure Ben is a racial stereotype character but Number 5 more than makes up for it by being so much fun. Number 5 is like an adorable baby who grows up with all the pop culture references. It is light charming family fun.",Short Circuit
2,Hitchcoc,Nice Charming Movie,9,4 December 2016,"My family and I love this movie. We've watched it a couple times and are always satisfied with the way it ends. A little robot begins to absorb all kinds of information, based on his ""knowledge"" of popular culture. He goes from a machine to a near sentient being, but because of his ""talents,"" the fascists in the government want to dismantle his robot brain and use him for defense purposes, or at least keep his technology from getting into the wrong hands. This came after ET and we grow to like the little guy. Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg get into the act and have a nice chemistry. Of course, the deck is stacked against the authorities but that's a lot of fun.",Short Circuit
3,Prismark10,Who's Johnny,5,24 September 2016,"John Badham went all hi-tech with his hacker thriller WarGames. In Short Circuit the inspiration is to marry the heartwarming story of ET with robot technology and the story of Robot Number 5, an advanced robot developed for military purposes but gains some kind of artificial intelligence after being struck by lightning and being fried.Number 5 goes on the run from the defence company who want to disassemble him and he ends up befriending naive animal lover Ally Sheedy who protects him but initially thinks he is an alien from outer space.Steve Guttenberg is the creator of the robot program, unhappy about the proposed military uses of his creations. He also goes on the hunt for Number 5 and realises that his robot has developed self awareness and become alive. However the chase led by GW Bailey (Guttenberg's co- star from the Police Academy films) is mainly for comic relief.Short Circuit is a cheesy 1980s film that kids would had enjoyed back then. The robot's image was 'borrowed' by WALL-E and the robotic special effects have been well utilised in this film. Less so is the comedy Indian side kick played by a browned up white actor with a comedy accent. It was inappropriate at the time and frankly highlights the racism of the mainstream film industry that permeated in the 1980s.",Short Circuit
4,mark.waltz,"Way to go, Number Five!",8,23 April 2021,"Next to Mel Blanc as Twiki, Tim Blaney is probably the best robot voice in film history (and maybe the voices of R2-D2 and C3PO as well), and he has a lot more lines than just ""Beedee beedee beedee"". Created by Austin Pendleton's robot factory, he is managed by Steven Gutenberg and Fisher Stevens, yet comes to life by the presence of a strike of lightning. Falling off of a truck, he lands on Ally Sheedy's snack van and proceeds to turn her life upside down. When Sheedy and Guttenberg meet, it's love at first sight in spite of the presence of a nasty ex-boyfriend and Sheedy and Number Five's love of dancing to the Bee Gees.""Hey laser lips! Your mother was a snowblower!"" is just one of the many wisecracks that comes out of Number Five, said to one of the non-lightening struck robots sent out by Pendleton (through the comically nasty G. W. Bailey) to capture him. This is a crowd pleasing hit that actually benefited from product placement, with Number Five watching TV and picking up all sorts of commercial references that are nostalgic to those who were around at the time.Then there's the plethora of voices that come out of Blaney which includes a delightful imitation of John Wayne. Fisher Stevens, a white character doing a comical Indian accent (tracing his ancestry back to Pittsburgh), gets the best lines among the human actors, and plays quite a lovably funny character, sweet and smart and loyal and wonderfully geeky.As for Sheedy and Guttenberg, they have a wonderful chemistry even though they don't meet up until nearly an hour into the film. This has such a sweet aura about it that it's easy to look past the comparisons to other similar films of the time, and even though Number Five is a robot, he's obviously greatly inspired by the success of E. T. four years before this. Cartoon like action and good special effects have kept this as fresh as when it was released 35 years ago, and of course, it warranted a sequel which isn't bad either. Number Five is nearly worth a 10 from me.",Short Circuit
5,kosmasp,Number 5 is alive,9,5 June 2020,"That was the German title. And while it had been a while since I last saw it and I reckon some things did not age that well, this is still a very fun movie to watch. Steve Guttenberg was on top of the world at one point in time. If you don't recognize that name, don't worry. His star did not shine for a long period of time (I have not looked into the why to be honest), but watch Police Academy for further proof of his ... existence.But back to this, with a robot that escapes ""by accident"" (or rather coincidence) from a facility and has to be found. It could have found a better host than the character Ally Sheedy portrays! No detention anymore for her (check her bio for the reference if you didn't get it), but quite a few innuendos overall that may feel weird at time, but I guess were testament of the time.This still is more a kids movie even if it has some jokes that are aimed to get a smile out of adults too. I have to rewatch the sequel too, but for now stick to the original which is really funny",Short Circuit
6,gavin6942,Classic 1980s,7,23 December 2009,"A government robot, designed to kill, is hit by lightning and may now be alive, whatever it means to be alive. A traveling bakery woman and the scientist who created the robot (called Number Five) face off against the government to see that he is not disassembled.Long before Wall-E, there was Johnny Five. With Ally Sheedy, Fisher Stevens and Steve Guttenberg, this is an 80s classic. I miss the Guttenberg, I miss the Sheedy. And Stevens was underrated even in his time, he was an excellent comedian and character actor.I do not wish to really go on and on about this film because everyone has seen it. But the point is this: it's a good family film, with humor and charm and very little offensive in it. No nudity, little violence, and only one really noticeable use of profanity, which is pretty light by today's standards. The sequel is also worth checking out.",Short Circuit
7,lee_eisenberg,feeling is believing,9,5 June 2013,"Now here's something. John Badham* of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""WarGames"" fame directs a movie about a robot that gets struck by lightning and becomes sentient. Some scenes are clearly inserted for comic relief, but the movie flows very smoothly. Steve Guttenberg (best known for ""Police Academy"") and Ally Sheedy (best known for ""The Breakfast Club"") both play roles that look like different turns for them. It's just a really fun movie that everyone can enjoy. I sure liked it. A bit like ""E.T."" without copying it too much.PS: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic spoofed the theme song ""Who's Johnny"" as ""Here's Johnny"" (about Ed McMahon, not ""The Shining"").*John Badham's sister Mary played Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"".",Short Circuit
8,jboothmillard,Short Circuit,6,23 February 2009,"I knew it was about a robot with a mind of its own, and I had seen it listed in TV times so much, I had to try it one day, and I'm glad I did, from director John Badham (Saturday Night Fever, WarGames). Basically a group of experimental military robots have been created, and one of them, Number 5, gets a surge of lightning from a strike on a power cable going into his system. He has escaped and is now wanting (that's right, wanting) to learn about the world around him, and that is where vegetarian animal lover Stephanie Speck (The Breakfast Club's Ally Sheedy) comes in. Number 5 wants ""input"", aka information, and he gets all of this from rapidly racing through books and watching TV, until he has become alive. Meanwhile, his creator Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) along with fellow robot expert Ben Jabituya (Fisher Stevens) are looking for Number 5, aka Johnny 5, to see what has happened to him, and they are against the military forces who think it's best to destroy him. Also starring Austin Pendleton as Howard Marner, Police Academy's G.W. Bailey as Skroeder, Brian McNamara as Frank, John Garber as Otis and Tim Blaney as the voice of Number 5. Guttenberg is always good to see on screen, Sheedy makes the most of her fascinated character, and Stevens makes some good giggles with his Apu from The Simpsons impression. The whole family will love the hip robot with its whiny voice, cheekiness, mimicry and gadgets, he is obviously what makes this film such fun to watch. Good!",Short Circuit
9,Woodyanders,Very amusing and entertaining 80's sci-fi comedy,8,30 January 2019,"Experimental military robot Number 5 believes that he's really alive after he gets struck by a bolt of lightning. Number 5 subsequently escapes from the lab and ventures into the outside world to embark on a journey of self-discovery.Director John Badham, working from a clever script by S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock, keeps the enjoyable story moving along at a snappy pace, maintains an engaging lighthearted tone throughout, and provides a winning surplus of pure sweet heart to go along with all the good-natured humor. Ally Sheedy as flaky nature-loving free spirit Stephanie Speck and Steve Guttenberg as slightly awkward, yet amiable nonconformist inventor Newton Crosby maker for charming and likeable leads; they receive sturdy support from Fisher Stevens as Crosby's bumbling assistant Ben Jabituya, Austin Pendleton as nerdy CEO Howard Marner, G.W. Bailey as ramrod security chief Skroeder, and Brian McNamara as redneck jerk Frank. With his vibrant personality, upbeat mood, boundless curiosity, and infectious sense of childlike wonder, Number 5 is simply a delight to watch as he learns all about the joy of being a living and feeling sentient being. Kudos are also in order for David Shire's sprightly score and Nick McLean's glossy widescreen cinematography. An extremely fun and uplifting treat.",Short Circuit
10,Tweekums,Fun film from the '80s,7,23 February 2009,"When I first watched this in the '80s I rather enjoyed it as I recall and upon watching it again recently found that it had lost little of its charm.The film opens with five new military robots being demonstrated to a group of politicians and senior officers. After they show how the can eliminate a variety of vehicles everybody goes inside and the robots are recharged... while robot number five is still connected to the generator there is a lightning strike which causes it to malfunction. After a collision with a rubbish disposal robot it ends up on the back of a lorry with the rubbish and is taken off the base. At around the same time it is noticed that he is missing and everybody at Nova, the company that made it, starts to panic. Skroeder, the head of security sets off with his men to catch it while its inventor Dr. Newton Crosby and his assistant Ben Jabituya follow its tracking signal to help them locate it. They find Number Five but it evades capture by jumping off a bridge and parachuting on to the back of a van driven by Stephanie, by now it is out of range for the tracker.When Stephanie finds Number Five she initially thinks he is an alien and invites it into her house where he seeks input, he quickly reads every book in the house and turns to the television for further learning. When she learns that instead of being an alien he is a robot from a weapons manufacturer she is not impressed and calls them to take it away, however when she tells Number Five that he is to return to Nova he reacts in a way one wouldn't expect from an inanimate object... he shows fear. Realising that he is in danger Number Five takes Stephanie's van which he learns how to drive by reading the instruction manual. She manages to jump aboard as he drives off but they crash and are found be Doctor Crosby who deactivates Number Five and puts him on a truck bound for Nova. Five however manages to reactivate himself and escapes once again. He returns to Stephanie and is present to help rescue her from her abusive ex-boyfriend. She believes that if she can persuade Doctor Crosby that Number Five is alive then he well help them, unfortunately they meeting is interrupted by Skroeder and as well as rescuing Stephanie Number Five must confront the other robots, I won't say what he does to them as it would spoil one of the films jokes.As stated before the film still seems charming and Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg performed well in the lead roles and while watching it was easy to suspend disbelief and accept that Number Five was indeed alive. I'm not sure what to make of Fisher Stevens's portrayal of Ben Jabituya, on the one hand he was an amusing character, on the other it seemed very dated to have a white actor playing an Indian rather than actually employing somebody from the Sub-continent. There are one or two jokes some parents might find a bit racy but I think most children would enjoy this film as will plenty of adults, especially those who first saw it as youngsters in the '80.",Short Circuit
11,BA_Harrison,A consistently entertaining piece of 80s fun.,7,6 September 2008,"Looking like a cross between a mechanical ET and a prototype WallE, Johnny 5, the robotic hero of John Badham's Short Circuit, is a top-secret, multi million dollar piece of army hardware that comes 'alive' when he is accidentally zapped by a bolt of lightning. After escaping the high-tech facility where he was designed and built (by Steve Guttenberg, of all people!!!), Number 5 meets animal-lover Stephanie (Ally Sheedy), absorbs huge amounts of information from her books and television, and learns that life is preciousespecially his own.Oozing 80s style from every frame, Short Circuit might be an extremely dated movie (check out the computers that feature in the filma Mac classic is seen being unpacked!) but it still manages to be a whole load of fun thanks to its likable characters and a pretty funny script. I just finished watching the DVD with my kids (aged 7 and 5), and we all had a great time: I particularly enjoyed the sense of nostalgia I got from watching a 'pre-internet, pre-mobile phone era' piece of cheesy sci-fi from my youth, whilst the children just lapped up the silly antics of Johnny 5.Badham might not be the most stylish of directors, but he can always be relied upon to deliver a solidly entertaining film, and although this one isn't packed with state of the art special effects (even for the time), sometimes the action is rather weak (the 'high speed' chase scenes look rather slow to me), and Fisher Stevens' portrayal of an Asian is rather dubious, it's still worth a try. Even if Guttenberg is in it.",Short Circuit
12,Quinoa1984,A sweet and genuine comedy,7,17 September 2000,"I think anyone any age can appreciate this film, and some might even find it funny.  Not terribly funny, but just good.  The plot involves a robot (#5) who after getting electricuted, becomes malfunctioned, in a good way (the robot thinks it's alive).  And some light hearted comedy (and some messages about life) ensues.  Nice to watch on a weekend day.  A-",Short Circuit

14,hitchcockthelegend,"SAINT Number 5, It's Alive!",7,26 August 2011,"Short Circuit is directed by John Badham and written by S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock. It stars Ally Sheedy, Steve Guttenberg, Fisher Stevens, Austin Pendleton, G.W. Bailey and Brian MacNamara. Tim Blaney voices the robot, and the design is by Syd Mead. Number 5, a prototype military robot, is hit by a power surge that causes a malfunction in its programming. When an accident sees it leave the Nova Laboratories grounds, Number 5 finds his way to the home of Stephanie Speck (Sheedy). Here it displays signs of being alive, but the new found respect for life could soon be curtailed as the Nova security staff are seeking him out for disassembly. On release it was met with mostly positive reviews, debuting at No.1 at the box office, film was undoubtedly a family winner. Also spawning a sequel due to its popularity, Short Circuit is by definition an enjoyable fantasy flick. Yet today there are film critics who give it a good kicking, lamenting how safe it is and decrying the sentimental aspects that come to the fore in the latter stages. That to me is like shooting Bambi! A refusal to let the child in all of us come out once in a while. Yeah it's schmaltzy at times, I'd personally be disappointed if a film about a robot finding a will to live wasn't! While in Sheedy and Guttenberg you couldn't ask for two more amiable bastions of Americana to star in such a movie. But the feel good factor is high and it's also full of funny sequences. Saturday Night Fever and The Three Stooges play a part, as does Fisher Stevens, who send the PC brigade scurrying for their complaint pens. Lighten up folks, the World has moved on you'll be pleased to know.Sometimes safe and amiable is all you need. I suggest it's all these grumpy modern day critics who need a good kicking, not Short Circuit. 7/10",Short Circuit
15,utgard14,"""Life not malfunction.""",7,17 June 2014,"A robot made self-aware after being struck by lightning runs away from the military weapons testing facility where it is set to be disassembled. The robot, called Number 5, meets a woman (Ally Sheedy), who befriends it and tries to help it. As the military hunt for the escaped robot, two scientists (Steve Guttenberg, Fisher Stevens) try to find it first.A heartfelt sci-fi comedy that's funny, positive, and extremely entertaining. How cool was that robot? Old school effects are remarkable. People built these things by hand, you know? There's just something so much more effective and impressive about that than CGI effects. The cast is really good. Sheedy and Guttenberg are both likable leads. Fisher Steven is a lot of fun. Guttenberg's Police Academy co-star G.W. Bailey plays to type as he did so often in the '80s. Such a fun movie. I had a big goofy grin on my face the whole time I was watching this.I recently read a review of this movie that trashed it. The reviewer's main reasons for doing so were based on how unrealistic it was. He went on and on about how robots aren't capable of this and that. It made me very sad for him because I know he must not have any friends. If you are reading this and you view Short Circuit the same way that reviewer does, please do yourself a favor -- go out, meet some people, have some adventures, enjoy life. Then come back and watch Short Circuit and see if the stick up your ass is gone yet.",Short Circuit
16,view_and_review,Number Five is Alive,7,9 January 2016,"My earliest memory of an A.I. movie is ""Terminator""--and ""Short Circuit"" is right after that. ""Short Circuit"" showed that adding emotion to the most robotic organism could make it lovable.""Short Circuit"" was a cute and funny movie appropriate for most audiences. The robot, Number 5 (voice by Tim Blaney), along with Ben (Fisher Stevens) were absolutely my two favorite characters. Number 5 because he was an adorable robot bumbling through his newly discovered ""life"" and Ben because his jumbled words and teen-like lust for women was hilarious.As much as I like those two characters I found Stephanie (Ally Sheedy) annoying. She was so naive and vociferous in her naivety it was sickening. She was clearly the movie's means of showing off Number 5 and his new self awareness no matter how elementary it was done.Still, I appreciate the movie ""Short Circuit"". This was the predecessor to ""Chappie"" and many people may not know that. It's still funny and a good watch.",Short Circuit
17,FlashCallahan,For the sake of Peter.....,9,8 November 2012,"Number 5, one of a group of experimental military robots, undergoes a sudden transformation after being struck by lightning.He develops self-awareness, consciousness, and a fear of the disassemble that awaits him back at the factory.With the help of a young woman, Number 5 tries to evade capture and convince his creator that he has truly become alive.....This is one of those films that was released in the eighties which you really only appreciate it if you were a child at the time it was released.Introducing it to my daughter, she loved it, but I feel that people my age, if they saw it now for the first time, they really wouldn't feel nostalgic toward it, a lot like me and Buckaroo Banzai.Other than that, it's the epitome of eighties cheese, Sheedy was in her prime, and Guttenberg was riding so high from Police Academy he brought his friends from the franchise along for the ride.And don't forget, it was acceptable in the eighties to darken someone skin to make them appear to be of a different race, and mock their race by making him say things in the wrong order.Hey ho, it's a fun film though, and it's all down to Johnny 5 and some marvellous direction by Badham.It's a simple homage of Frankenstein, but it's for he kids, so he just wants to learn, and he loves everyone and everybody.I'm sure somewhere in the narrative there is some message about love or how war is bad, but I was nine when this came out and found the three stooges robots brilliant.",Short Circuit
18,Aaron1375,Somewhat good comedy film thanks in part to Ally Sheedy.,7,20 April 2010,"This film had the same basic premise as another 80's movie that came out not that long before or after called ""Chopping Mall"". Basically a lightening strike causes a robot, or robots in the case of that movie, to go out of control. While they went killer in that movie, here it had a more positive effect as it made the robot self aware and actually seemed to give it a mind of its own. The result, a robot made for military use on the run from the military who wants to get it back. He somehow gets into the home of a woman who takes him in and soon discovers that the robot is actually quite intelligent and she later tries to convince one of his creators that he is actually alive. A lot of funny things happen, though as you can expect a lot of sweet sentimental stuff is to be expected too. Also, Steven Guttenberg is also a star in this one, and I have never really cared for him that much. He is tolerable in this film though and not nearly as annoying as Fisher Stevens is, who for some reason was made the focus of the sequel so yeah I hated the sequel. This one though for the most part is rather good and a rather nice family flick.",Short Circuit
19,Mr-Fusion,Screams '80s and I love every ounce of it,8,13 August 2015,"Were it not for the salty dialogue, I'd be surprised that Disney's brand isn't attached to ""Short Circuit"". It amuses me that such grown-up science fiction themes - sentience and identity - are couched in a silly kid's movie with a cute robot. Regardless, it did its job on me as a kid, and I've loved it ever since. I've always been a sucker for that old computerized robot voice you hear in this movie, and I'm kinda surprised it didn't leave me with a zen for vodka tonics as well.But it's also got plenty in the amusing department: Ally Sheedy's comical overacting, a guy in brownface, happy-go-lucky Steve Guttenberg, and most importantly, the cool robot with the funny voice and distinctive look.And a laser.A lot of fun, this movie.8/10",Short Circuit
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,The best childhood memories,9,15 July 2006,"Recently I was talking to my mom and for some reason this movie just popped back up into my memory and how much I loved it as a kid. The next day she saw it in a $5.00 bin at Wal Mart and bought it for me. *sob!*, how touching! Anyways, I still love this movie, I mean, I know it's a movie for kids, but still I think adults could enjoy this movie just as well. Not since C3PO have I love a robot so much! OK, that sounds silly, but Johnny Five is awesome.Basically, the movie is just about a robot that was meant for army use is struck by lightening and malfunctions. He gets loose into the town where he is found by Ally Sheedy, and she learns that he is more than a robot, but he feels that he's alive. But the army and ""Nova""(the plant that created him) feels different. Until Number Five and Ally convince Steve Guttenberg otherwise.It's a heart felt comedy that anyone could enjoy. I swear, this movie is definitely worth more than just a 5.9. I know anyone who sees it will most likely agree with me, at least I hope so.9/10",Short Circuit
21,OllieSuave-007,I wished the characters were short circuited!,1,14 February 2015,"Another movie from my kid past, a story about a military robot named Number 5 developing self-awareness and consciousness after being struck by lightening. With the company who built him, Nova, out to get him because they think he has malfunctioned, technician Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and animal lover Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy) are on a mission to save Number 5 from being reprogrammed.After watching this movie in its entirety as an adult, I, unfortunately, was not impressed with the film. The movie takes a very long time to gain any steam, if any, and there is really no plot, just Number 5 befriending Stephanie while Nova is out to get him - no twists or turns and no unpredictable moments. I could live with movies with simple or no basic plot lines if there are any redeeming qualities like humor, comic relief, likable characters and action. This movie, to me, doesn't deliver on any of those. The so-called comedy is unfunny, the action is dull and the characters were extremely annoying.Ally Sheedy's Stephanie Speck character was loud, obnoxious, overbearing and developed no chemistry with lead Steve Guttenberg; Fisher Stevens' Ben Jabituya character was very lame with his dumb, stereotypical Indian accent and unfunny jokes; Austin Pendleton's Howard Marner character was overly-excited; and G.W. Bailey's Skroeder character was over-asserted as the supposed villain. Only Steve Guttenberg, Brian McNamara and Number 5, which I thought was pretty cool, had any likable qualities.Overall, though, this movie is dull and boring with pretty awful acting.

22,ericstevenson,It's completely harmless,6,20 February 2017,"This movie tells the story of a robot known as Johnny 5 who gains emotions upon being hit by lightning. Actually, they don't say his name until the very end. The visuals are rather nice. It is kind of awkward to watch this because it's hard to tell which parts are supposed to be funny. A lot of it is really goofy and it's difficult to even determine which parts of the movie are supposed to be serious. We do get some pretty talented actors here. I will say that I'm annoyed by this one Indian guy. From what I heard, that's not a real Indian playing him so it does come off as pretty offensive.I can understand why a lot of people like this film. For me, it's just meh. The special effects hold up fairly well. It's pretty easy to think that this character's design inspired the title character from ""Wall-E"". Yeah, that's a much better movie. Most of the story doesn't make much sense and it does get kind of repetitive. It doesn't really have anything that unique and that is something that I look for in the sheer number of movies I've seen. It's pretty fine for what it is. **1/2",Short Circuit

24,lesleyharris30,"Simple and Fun,",7,18 July 2013,"Short Circuit is a good movie with a good storyline and a decent but not fantastic cast.I watched the movie because my mom always talked about it as a fond movie she remembers as a child,but it definitely wouldn't hold up today,the effects and especially the acting is very cheesy,but its almost impossible not to fall in love with Number 5,he's a very funny and lovable character.I wasn't impressed with the cast,however,I did enjoy G.W. Bailey's performance,I really enjoyed his asshole that he proved from Police Academy that he can pull it off very well.Short Circuit is a very fun movie that the whole family can enjoy.After the fifth member of a group of robots is electrocuted,he forms human feelings and emotions,and escapes his organisation with no intention of returning.",Short Circuit
25,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Don't worry little lady, I'll fix their wagon.",7,4 March 2007,"Short Circuit is one of those films I rented as a kid back in the precious 80s when we got so many good family movies that just wouldn't see the light of day in these awful times. A Short Circuit made in 2007 would be mind-numbingly PC with bullet-time effects and a CGI Johnny voiced by a hip-hop 'artist'. It's a grim time for this genre indeed. But back in 1986 I had nothing to complain about as most of the family movies from that decade are fondly remembered as classics.I loved this movie as a kid and it's been a long, long time since I watched it from start to finish. Plus the VHS I rented back then was in horrid pan and scan with half the picture chopped-off. Which is a real shame since John Badham shot it brilliantly-framed Panavision. So I've never really seen the FULL movie until now. How does it hold-up 21 years later? Well, I guess you could say Johnny Five is kinda dated but not so much as all the rest of the 'ground-breaking' technology at the Nova factory. Number Five is a robot made for Military Stealth purposes and armed with a laser beam. But designer Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his partner Ben Jabituya (a non-Indian and very funny Fisher Stevens) originally designed him as a marital aid, apparently. They are unhappy with the way Nova has marketed the robot but after a demonstration to the Military, Five is struck by lightning and assumes consciousness. Needing input and desperate to learn more about his surroundings, he escapes the factory and journey's across Oregon, soaking up knowledge and the idiosyncrasies of modern human culture. As a reflection of today's 'zany' society, Five is full of spirit, personality and random pop-culture references.The Military are kinda annoyed at a potential lethal weapon (not the Mel Gibson kind) running loose about America, so it's their new mission to find him and destroy him. Five, who has been taken in by animal-lover (not in THAT way) Stephanie Speck (a gorgeous Ally Sheedy) does everything he can to stay out of harm's way. But they are persistent and won't let him live because they don't believe he is truly alive.It's not totally original since some of it feels inspired by the works of Issac Asamov and I doubt a film like this would have been green-lighted had E.T. not been so successful. But it is very enjoyable and funny and Johnny Five is a great character despite being nothing more than a puppet. Short Circuit is definitely a film for any kid born in the 80s. The video-game obsessed kids of today might to be so interested but its charming simplicity and good-natured story will never really date despite the old-fashioned 'cutting-edge' technology featured in the film.",Short Circuit
26,The-Sarkologist,Delightfully Entertaining,7,28 January 2020,"This is another one of those delightful films that I remember watching from the 80s. In fact, I suspect that it is one of those films that I watched quite a few times, though it certainly does seem that it as falling into obscurity these days. I'm not entirely sure whether I would consider this to be a romantic comedy though, particularly since one of the main characters happens to be this robot that has, well, come alive.Basically the film focuses on this robot that was struck by lightning, and then manages to escape from the facility in which he was built. This of course sets off a chain of events, particularly since these robots cost something like 11 million a piece, and also happens to have a pretty powerful laser attached to their backs. However, it is also one of those films about how this robot, who has suddenly discovered that he is sentient, begins to explore the world.It certainly falls into the category of a family movie, and it does have a rather nice feel to it. I guess in a way it is one of those films that is capitalising on the popularity of ET, namely because we have this alien that has come to Earth and chooses to learn about out life and culture (which, of course, turns out to be American culture because, hey, is there any other culture out there - and also, they always seem to land up in America, but that is probably because this is where the film has been made, and where most of the money comes from).It is still interesting though, looking back on these old films and seeing what things were like back then, particularly since these days one could almost feel that one could build a robot like Number 5 (who eventually takes the name Johnny Five). Okay, you wouldn't have the laser, but I suspect that if you were to venture around some of the geek shows out there you might actually find one that somebody has built one.The other thing is that it does seem to follow some sort of pattern, with the military and all that, and of course the rotten ex-boyfriend that our heroine seems to have picked up (though you sometimes wonder why such a girl would end up with a guy like that, but then again she seems to mention how she always picks the nasty ones). This certainly does give you a hint on where the action is going to go, especially since we have Steve Gutemberg playing a rather insular engineer, though he certainly doesn't seem to be as bad around people as, well, his co-worker.Yeah, this film is pretty good, and it certainly does have a nice feel about it. I personally don't think it has aged all that much, especially in an age when we do have companies building robots for war. In way it is fun, and it is a shame that it doesn't seem to make its way back onto our screens.",Short Circuit

On the contrary, the robot is cool, his learning shows some good tricks.All this, without digital effects. It was the time of real things.

31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Cast and crew of ""Short Circuit"" get it: it's just about a goofy robot",7,6 May 2009,"""Short Circuit"" is one of those rare '80s comedies that knows what it is. It delights in its tackiness, awkward jokes and poking fun at both the ""tech movement"" and Cold War dramas. It never gives off the sense that it's trying to be something it's not, staying fresh, funny and even laughing at itself.Maybe the best way to put the filmmaker's attitudes into perspective while making ""Short Circuit"" would be to mention that director John Badham not only made a much more serious Cold War adventure film in ""War Games"" a few years before, but the robot (No. 5 as he's called) at one point imitates John Travolta's dance moves in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" another Badham film. Badham even takes to making fun of his other work using ""Short Circuit.""Although Badham gets the credit for making No. 5 such a lovable character (with some help from fine voice acting in Tim Blaney), the writing team of Wilson and Maddock deserve a lot of credit for the film's clever and amusing take on artificial life as well as the numerous jabs at Cold War America.""Short Circuit"" is about a top secret set of military robots designed by Newton (Steve Guttenberg of ""Police Academy"") for the military supplier he works for called NOVA. When a lightning strike fries one of the robots, he ignores his programming and escapes the facility where he meets an animal-lover named Stephanie (Ally Sheedy of Badham's ""War Games"") who takes him in believing he's an alien. When NOVA searches for No. 5, the robot soon develops the concept that if NOVA catches him, they will ""disassemble"" or ""kill"" him. The rest of the film No. 5 is on the run with the help of Stephanie and eventually Newton.No. 5 is a crafty robot thanks to some brilliant writing. After soaking in hours of television, he drops clever catch phrases from westerns and other films including commercial jingles as he evades his captors and even other robots in what is a hysterical sequence. Wilson, Maddock and Badham realize what a truly unique character they have to play with and they utilize him to the fullest.Admirably, everyone on this movie knows that the plot is immaterial and it's all about watching to see what goofy stuff No. 5 will do next. Both Sheedy and Guttenberg just play to the robot, seeming to laugh whenever they have to interact with him. They understand it's not about them at all and they just enjoy themselves while doing adequate acting. The only other role with any personality is Fisher Stevens as Ben, the unacknowledged Indian stereotype that loves women and butchering English phrases for comedic value. Funny, but it probably wouldn't fly in the 21st Century.It's also worth knowing that this is not as much a family film. Kids will find No. 5 funny, but there's a lot of questionable language including some sexual references. With the number of funny one-liners, ""Short Circuit"" is ripe for kids to repeat. Still, the comedy in this film is so much better than so many other '80s movies because it recognizes that it's goofy, which also makes the satire work better. Not Badham or anyone else tried too hard to make a quality movie and the result was that they got one.",Short Circuit
32,Anonymous_Maxine,So cutesy but so good!!,8,12 April 2008,"I haven't seen Short Circuit for some time now, but it is such a huge milestone in my childhood that I have to say something about it. Maturer audiences will have a hard time overlooking some of the childish nuances of the movie, but it is such a fun and entertaining family film that all of those things can be easily forgiven. It reminds me of other wonderful family films like Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies, that I used to watch over and over when I was a kid. I feel like I've lost something when I can't think of a single movie now that I love so much that I will watch it a few times a week. Maybe I just am more aware of the time involved in watching the same movie over and over today than I used to be. Johnny 5 is a robot designed for military use until one day it's struck by lightning and, apparently, comes to life. This is a pretty tired formula, something man-made suddenly displaying life-like qualities and wanting to be recognized as a real boy, but it's accompanied by some clever messages about the advancement of technology, particularly technology designed to replace humans, which has always been seen as a bit of a dangerous idea, criticized brilliantly by everyone from Charlie Chaplin to James Cameron. Johnny 5's adventures involve his efforts to avoid capture by the people who made him (""NOVA! No!!""), while at the same time trying to prove to the world that he's a living entity now. They could not make a movie like this today. Sadly, CGI has forever replaced the need to create a physical robot like the one that plays Johnny 5 in this movie, so any Short Circuit that was made today would just be some soul-less digital effect cavorting across the screen, instantly forgettable. But here, he's really there, and he's heavy and clumsy and metallic, but so memorable as a movie character that I've recently read that the actual robot prop was sold for something like $500,000. Now THAT is a fan!Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy have a cute chemistry on screen that is satisfactorily simple. They are both cookie-cutter caricatures, Sheedy the lonely Stephanie, who drives an ice-cream truck for a living, and Guttenberg plays a scientist named Newton, who works for the evil NOVA but who only needs a cute ice-cream lady and a charming robot to change his evil ways. Sound like fun? No? Well, it is, trust me. The film has definitely dated, but I'll take special effects that look dated 20 years later over expensive CGI that never looked real in the first place any day. A lot of films claim to be fun for all ages, but Short Circuit is one of the few that really is. It's too bad that movies like this seem to be gone forever now.",Short Circuit

Though if you look beyond the computer components and the boring banter of this high tech machine facility, what we have is a quite an adventurous, and surprise fun flick. When a experimental robot, among a score of them, is electrocuted and grows smarts and takes off from the facility to tour the splendour of San Francisco, it's creator, likable Guttenberg, a stay in, and his peers, one another Police Academy favourite, are desperate to recover it, where they do whatever it takes. The robot is befriended by a female vet, sweet Sheedy who harbours it, and the two become great friends. The manipulation of the robot is very smart as from the designers of it, and the escape sequences are so well done. Too, I liked the geeky, sleepy voice of one of the managers, as if illustrating sarcastically the enjoyment of this job. Fisher Stevens is a hoot as Guttenberg's assistant, who lectures him on how there's another world outside the facility. SC pretty much has the same kind of approaching climax, whether it's ET, Starman, where Sheedy, who of course strikes up a relationship with Guttenberg, will protect Johnny Five at all costs, from the facility guy who will turn back into an experiment. Not being a lover of kid's flicks, though I was more flexible as a teen, this film had grown on me, and it's song from El Debarge rocks. Certainly a movie for all ages, this couldn't be a more perfect flick for everyone. Of course it spawned a not as successive sequel, not in the same class as the first, with only Stevens staying for it.",Short Circuit

It's your typical P.G. rated comedy with some slapstick childish humor mixed in with some light ""adult"" language as well. Now what's an 80's movie without Ally Sheedy or Steve Guttenberg? (this time you have both!) Short Circuit was made during the time period when Ally Sheedy was an attractive lass. She stars as the lady who harbors the robot (named Johnny-5). Steve Guttenberg stars as the Military engineer who designed it. Fisher Stevens co-stars as his East Indian assistant.It's a harmless film that worth a watch.

It decides to escape the military base and live a different life. The movie follows his journey and the people who help him while the government hunts him down.

I love the initial scenes showing how powerful the robots are and the unveiling of 5 when he escapes and his face is red and you can't tell if he's going to be good or bad to civilians. This film has tremendous dialogue, especially between Guttenberg and Stevens. Their chemistry in this was magic. There's so many memorable lines in this like ""Your mother is a snowblower,"" and ""Johnny 5 alive.""

If you were sentient yourself in '86, no doubt you remember this one. It's the epitome of an eighties movie in all the wrong ways: bad comedy, forced plot developments, a big dose of cold war overtones, a valley girl accent, Steve Guttenberg... the list is awfully lengthy. We've even got a white man in brown face, though he does nothing terribly egregious or offensive beyond the (surprisingly convincing) makeup.Short Circuit manages to get by on the power of spirit and enthusiasm alone, which is itself another '80s stereotype. It's got energy to spare, plus absolutely no shame over its shortcomings, which makes it awkwardly endearing. Having said that, and appreciated it, the flick is often eye-roll bad, much worse than I'd remembered. Subtle like a bull on the warpath and cheesier than a Kraft dinner, I felt a little embarrassed for being such a fan back when I could still count my age on two hands. My sons, though, only a few years removed from that age themselves, adored it, so maybe there's something innocent and beautiful about that.

39,snoozejonc,Lovable robot in a great movie for children,7,17 January 2021,"A robot designed for warfare escapes from a laboratory and strikes up a friendship with young woman.I enjoyed this as a child and it wasn't bad at 40 whilst watching with my 5 year old daughter. The main reason to watch it is for the incredibly likeable robot Number Five and the 80s technology.Watching it recently made it feel like someone had carved out a massive chunk of the 1980s, melted it down, poured it into an E.T. shaped mould and what emerged was a silly but enjoyable children's movie.The plot is 'fish out of water', similar in spirit to Spielberg's aforementioned masterpiece, with a robot in place of an alien. What is presented, in a very simple story, is his fight to be acknowledged as a sentient being and his friendship with a pacifist. It also gently tackles the theme of perverting science for warfare.Performances portraying human characters for me are a mixed bag. The main protagonists played by Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg are okay, but their roles are somewhat annoyingly written, particularly Sheedy who's character seems to spend a significant part of the film either behaving stupidly or ranting about 'lying' and 'liars'. The support roles are much better with GW Bailey, Austin Pendleton and Fisher Stevens all on good form in entertaining roles. Stevens character Ben Jabituya was written in an era where casting a Caucasian actor to play a role of differing ethnicity was largely acceptable. When you compare with negative and stereotypical caricatures seen in Hollywood, he doesn't feel hugely offensive. He's a bit nerdish and portrayed as struggling to adapt to English phraseology and American culture, but he is an intelligent computer programmer who steals most of the scenes he's in. Compared with Indian characters in another 80s movie like 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' and he feels far more positive. However, it's understandable how today's audience might find this difficult to take as filmmaking now shows far more progressive thinking when making casting decisions.The star turn of course comes from Tim Blaney as Number Five. Who would have thought a robot could be so lovable? The character captured my heart as a child and likewise my daughter. This was helped no doubt by the excellent design from Eric Allard and Syd Mead and great puppetry work that brought it to life. The great Pixar classic 'Wall-E' definitely took inspiration from this creation. It was high concept technology at the time along with all the chunky Spectrum/Commodore/Amstrad looking computers that went with it.I judge a lot of movies these days by how well they can hold a child.

Having no wish to be destroyed, our little hero befriends an animal lover (Ally Sheedy) who offers him protection.While it presents no originality, and the special effects and gadgetry have been outdone both before and after its release, ""Short Circuit"" is a good humoured film which provides reasonable entertainment thanks to some enjoyably funny antics from No.5.

41,vertigo_14,I Heart Number Five.,8,19 April 2004,"Short Circuit is an off-the-wall comedy about a series of robots made of the military. They sort of resemble Conky from the old Pee Wee's Play House series. One of the robots, 'Number Five', escapes and finds sanctuary in the home of Stephanie Speck (Allly Sheedy), a nice lady with a soft spot for runaways. Speck becomes good friends with 'Number Five' who begins to take on a lot of human characteristics, transcending the static life of a robot or the hostile life of a military weapon, which is what the robots were designed for. Speck learns that Number Five's owners are looking for him, but she knows that the military would only destroy Number Five or terminate the emotional drive that he has developed. Number Five's designer, Newton Crosby (Guttenberg) and his silly assistant Ben Jabituya (Stevens), have yet to appreciate what Number Five has achieved, as a shell of wires and controls able to take on human qualities, but, soon, they too will join Speck in the quest to save 'Number Five.' Some of it is kind of reminscint of other 80s sci-fi movies like 'Batteries Not Included' and 'E.T.' There's two issues at work in this movie. The first, and obvious one being about the development of human emotion and would it be possible for anything to gain an understanding and appreciation for it? And the second being the ethics of military useage. Plus, it's your standard 80s love and friendship story. Because of the story and the sharp wit comedy and sarcasm, it's makes for good comedy. I haven't seen the sequel in a long time, but I do remember enjoying it almost as much as the first. I think that's because 'Number Five' is such a funny, loveable robot.If you like the theme of this movie, I recommend seeing the hilarious comedy, 'Making Mr. Right,' which is about a robot designed for space exploration rather than military use. But, the robot begins to take on human emotions while the owner becomes increasingly more like a robot. (It's from Susan Siedleman, the director of 'Desperately Seeking Susan.')",Short Circuit
42,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A well made metallic E.T. knock-off,8,2 July 2012,"Movie history has shown us that audiences have been handed knock-off items before. Of course, most of them are either made so badly that they gain a cult following or they just sink altogether with no one behind them at all. And then there are the few that stand the test of time for being executed well and received few to little recognition. Just like the film Leviathan (1989), which was a combination of several previous films, still had a lot of appeal to it. The same goes for Short Circuit.It obviously does not have the same story line but the looks and the feel of it are almost parallel to the movie of E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial (1982). Short Circuit is literally about a ""Short Circuit"" in the robotic war machine. The ""Short Circuit"" occurs when a bolt of lightning strikes the robot and gives it its own brain. Like any character's origin, they are always new to their surroundings. The robot analyzes and senses its perimeter to make an assessment of what it should do next. And as time goes on, the character begins to learn how to react quicker in different situations.However, none of this were to have happened if it wasn't for the help of Ally Sheedy's character, Stephanie Speck. The voice of the machine is by Tim Blaney. Steven Guttenberg plays the creator of the machine (Newton Crosby) in this story. Guttenberg makes a good nerd, especially for what he looks like and his inability to communicate like a normal human being. Along side Crosby is his close friend Ben, played by Fisher Stevens, who I'll admit besides the robot, had some funny lines. I thought the robot character was well done too. The personality is very childlike and innocent which makes it a cute character to watch and listen too. It's not to say it has the greatest story or the funniest lines, but it does have character. In a sense it appears to look like a premature WALL·E (2008). The puppetry is well done too. All the movements are smooth and coordinated, making it look very lifelike. The soundtrack by David Shire is good too. The re-occurring them is welcomed as is the emotional tones there inserted inside them. If only this film could be looked back on as not a cheese film but of something with more value than that, then it really would stand the test of time.Short Circuit is well made for its time with realistic puppetry, comical scenes and good music.

45,mentalcritic,A rarity among family-oriented films...,8,12 February 2005,"There have been many films that claim they can entertain audiences of all ages. Indeed, this seems to be the most profitable kind of film to make, with the family-oriented often translating to the lowest common denominator. There is a rare kind of film in this oversaturated market, however. Namely, the film that claims it can entertain an audience in almost any age bracket, and really can deliver on this promise. I know how this sounds, so bear with me a moment.Short Circuit is, at heart, a comedy about what happens when a robot designed to replace a special forces soldier is struck by lightning, and starts to believe he is a living entity. Much of the rest of the film revolves around either Number 5's attempts to evade capture by the people who made him, or his attempts to convince the people he meets of the truly wonderful thing that has happened to him. Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg provide an excellent support cast that does a first rate job of interacting with the character. This was one of the first films to show human actors engaging in conversation with what was essentially a full-scale puppet, and it remains one of the best. With brilliant voice acting by Tim Blaney, Number 5 seems more human than some of the other actors in the film, especially G.W. Bailey. They must have had a special on Police Academy alumni that year.Speaking of Police Academy, the ""let's rip the front seats out and sit in the back"" joke gets a couple of references here. In fact, a few old classics get a good reference in this effort. Interestingly enough, the Three Stooges short that is shown and imitated in a couple of sequences is called Woman Haters. Go figure. The one weakness of the film is that it seems primarily constructed around a few puppeteering or special effects sequences. The use of the laser beams here seems very dated by modern standards, and the computers would look unbelievable if I hadn't personally seen the computers that were available to the public and business around this year.Sadly, they do not make films like this anymore. In this day and age, where every film has to be made as expensively as possible, and even films aimed at children seem segmented, nobody seems willing to consider that the adults in the audience might need to be entertained, too. Which is a real pity. Films like Short Circuit have the ability to appeal to this viewer even more now that he is twenty-something years old than was the case when he was eight years old. I doubt that anyone who turns twenty-six in 2020 is going to same the same about the Pokemon or other such mind-numbing single-digit-age-only crap that is being churned out.I gave Short Circuit an eight out of ten. It is starting to show its age, but as a relic of the mid-1980s, it also shows that there were people asking questions about the advancement of technology. Indeed, on the basis of films like Short Circuit, I am almost willing to regard the 1980s as the last bastion of creativity in the mainstream film industry. Give it a look expecting a film about more than money, and you may be pleasantly surprised.",Short Circuit
46,eminkl,Some films are best viewed in the memory banks,4,18 April 2020,"A freak lightning storm causes a war automaton to spontaneously go sentient during a military demonstration. If you were sentient yourself in '86, no doubt you remember this one. It's the epitome of an eighties movie in all the wrong ways: bad comedy, forced plot developments, a big dose of cold war overtones, a valley girl accent, Steve Guttenberg... the list is awfully lengthy. We've even got a white man in brown face, though he does nothing terribly egregious or offensive beyond the (surprisingly convincing) makeup. Short Circuit manages to get by on the power of spirit and enthusiasm alone, which is itself another '80s stereotype. It's got energy to spare, plus absolutely no shame over its shortcomings, which makes it awkwardly endearing. Having said that, and appreciated it, the flick is often eye-roll bad, much worse than I'd remembered. Subtle like a bull on the warpath and cheesier than a Kraft dinner, I felt a little embarrassed for being such a fan back when I could still count my age on two hands. My sons, though, only a few years removed from that age themselves, adored it, so maybe there's something innocent and beautiful about that. I guess some films are best viewed in the memory banks.",Short Circuit
47,Ruskington,Number 5 is still very much alive,6,13 April 2020,"I have a bit of a soft spot for eighties family films and Short Circuit is amongst the better ones. Movies like this have a simplicity and innocence that is sorely lacking from fast-paced complex modern movies. Short Circuit is a particularly charming story featuring the adorable 'Number 5' and the lovely Ally Sheedy, whose smile alone makes this movie a pleasure to watch. Yes, the cutesiness between the main characters is a bit full-on, but for younger viewers and nostalgic adults, this should be more endearing than irksome.Unlike a lot of older films that feature an array of special effects and advanced technology, Short Circuit has actually aged pretty well. They did a great job on the robots' appearance and animation and even as an adult, I still find Number 5 very likeable and believable.Steve Guttenberg is the Paul Rudd of his day (this is not a compliment) and doesn't really add much to this film. His somewhat sickly personality makes it difficult for him and the ditsy Sheedy to develop any real on-screen chemistry. Brian McNamara's character Frank is a little bit too much of a scumbag and its hard to imagine him and Stephanie ever being an item. Many modern viewers may also be slightly troubled by Fisher Stevens' rather bizarre portrayal of an Indian scientist.A lovely piece of nostalgia that is still very enjoyable all these years later. Not without its flaws, but certainly one to watch for lovers of eighties movies.",Short Circuit

The film is filled with plenty of one-liners and hilarious incidents involving the plot to capture Number Five and re-program him.

49,deatman9,Great film from my childhood.,7,11 December 2012,I remember seeing this movie when I was little and I have loved it ever since. The story is a great family tale thats heart warming and adorable. It is kind of a 80s B movie because the acting is not great but it makes up for it in story line and hilarity with the robot.This movie is about a military robot that is struck by lightning. It gets out of the military compound and now realizes it has gained consciousness. He finds a lady and they become friends and he becomes more and more human.This movie is just great I would still highly recommend this to kids now a days just because they are sure to fall in love with the robot just as I did as a kid.,Short Circuit

53,the amorphousmachine,"Fun 80s movie for the family, even if the technology seems a little dated!",7,7 July 2017,"Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy star in this often forgotten but somewhat iconic comedy-adventure with a robot in 'Short Circuit'. This 80s flick, directed by John Badham (Saturday Night Fever, Stakeout, Nick of Time) is funny, with a dash of heroics and that usual 80s trend of discovering new wondrous things- this times through the eyes of Johnny Five, who quickly realises that ""disassemble"" means death, kaput etc, and he simply wants to be alive. Fisher Stevens adds to the comedy as Guttenberg's co-worker, and G.W. Bailey (Guttenberg's rival from Police Academy) plays another bumbling incompetent glorified security guard for laughs too. Slightly dated, but still fun watching Johnny Five needing input, but with the advent of the internet, the technology does seem less futuristic in this film. Badham even recreates a scene from 'Saturday Night Fever' for laughs, and endears the audience to this robotic hero.I remember enjoying this film as a kid, and still enjoyed watching it again. Certainly a film in the same vein of 'Innerspace', 'Explorers', 'Flight of the Navigator' etc. If you haven't seen this film, it's still possible you may enjoy it, and I think it's still a decent family movie.***½",Short Circuit
54,jerekra,"""Your Mama was a Snow-Blower!""",8,9 June 2009,"Short Circuit is a rare case when a robot character makes a film and outshines the rest of the cast in the film.A military organization that builds weapons known as Nova creates five robots. One of the robots, Number Five, is hit by lightning and as a result is able to become ""alive"". He escapes from Nova and befriends a woman named Stephanie and begins to gain a lot of ""input"" and learns a lot. Nova plans on capturing him, but Number Five realizes that he must not get captured in order to remain alive.First off I have to say that this film is a comedy and much of it should not be taken seriously. By that I mean that the depiction of the military group of Nova constantly bickering and having lame discussions is something that film intended on doing.The acting and human characters are pretty odd in this film. I can see why Steve Guttenberg is constantly criticized by viewers. He is just a boring not funny guy who makes robots in this film. Ally Sheed plays Stephanie, a really naive and not that intelligent veterinarian. Also the character of Ben being a Caucasian who speaks like an Indian Person is something that I think is pretty funny, if not a bit racist as well. But for the most part the human characters are not special at all and completely overshadowed.They attempt to make a love story with Guttenberg and Sheed's character. However it comes off as rushed and horrible and I did not buy it. If anything the romance with Number five and Stephanie is much more convincable.The reason for this film being good is Number Five. Number Five is one of the greatest robot characters ever in a film. Hilarious, intelligent, and highly entertaining. He can do anything. It is quite interesting seeing him gain input and learn a lot about the world. It is not common for a robot to steal the show and make a movie good just by itself, but this is one case where that happens and the film is good because of it.Quite an interesting film. Lame acting and human characters. However a great character in Number Five. I recommend this film to viewers because of Number Five.",Short Circuit

(death) and tries to hide from the military who are trying to destroy him for being a malfunctioning war weapon. Lots of to-ing and fro-ing, very repetitive and disappointingly dull.",Short Circuit
56,robotbling,Can't decide if it's a crude comedy or kid's movie,5,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) Short Circuit is one of the most beloved robot-related movies of all time. More than 20 years have passed since I had last seen it, so it was with cautious optimism that I selected it on Netflix. I have fond memories of it, but I was just a kid then. Now, I can see it falls into just about every pitfall of the comedies that characterized the '80s. It closely follows the sappy E.T. formula, where an innocent, otherworldly creature is hunted by the heartless military authorities. So this is definitely a kid's film or is it? It stars the contemptible Steve Gutternberg (who hasn't starred in anything worthwhile since), as a carefree roboticist, and Ally Sheedy of The Breakfast Club gets caught in the middle as the animal-loving girl who can't find a trustworthy man. Notably, Fisher Stevens rounds out the cast as a racist ""brown face"" East Indian character with a thick accent. He's full of off-putting sexual innuendos, which kind of tars the film's family-friendly image. But there's enough slapstick gags based on The Three Stooges that Short Circuit is clearly appealing to a younger audience.The undeniable star of the show is Number 5, a prototype built by the NOVA company for the military. It was designed by the legendary concept artist Syd Mead (who gave us the TRON lightcycles and Blade Runner's spinners, among others). It's a fantastic looking robot puppet, and was one of the most sophisticated movie props ever built. It's expressive eyes are enough to melt any robot junkie's heart, even if it's primary objective is to nuke the Soviets. Hit by a jolt of lightning after an explosive demonstration of the robot squad's firepower, Number 5 inexplicably becomes self-aware and shows incredible intelligence and curiosity. It's a far cry from the complex and semi-believable explanations made by smarter science fiction, but it's just one of those things you have to go along with for the sake of the plot.Of course, all hell breaks loose when Number 5 inadvertently escapes from NOVA's lab. It's absolute nonsense with few if any laughs, but it's still sort of fun to watch out of curiosity. One can't help but notice the similarity between Number 5 and certain real robots developed since then. I'm sure I'll probably make a lot of people angry by saying so, but Short Circuit hasn't exactly aged well. It's one of the few examples of robots on film where the robot isn't a villain, so at least it has that going for it. It's practically required viewing if you're into robots, but unless you're on a serious nostalgia kick you're probably better off skipping it and watching WALL-E again instead.",Short Circuit

Yes, it's dodgy to have Fisher Stevens playing (presumably) a Pakistani...although not more dodgy than Peter Sellers in similar roles. Still, Number Johnny Five was an icon of an eighties childhood.

It's filled with romance, thrill, sci-fi and the comedy by the Indian guy.
However, is it still the same? Will we enjoy as much as people enjoyed in the 20th century? Definitely not!
The VFX, special effects camera quality, all are way below and cheaper what we are used to right now. The movie runs at a pace those days people were used to watch.
For now, it's a one time watch movie. It's not gripping, won't have you at the edge of the seat. The movie has gotten so old that you would hardly be able to connect with the characters.

59,RachelLone,Simply irresistible,8,24 February 2000,"If you like unusual, funny, pleasantly surprising action-packed sci-fi films, this is a must see. ""Short Circuit"" is indeed worth watching repeatedly.Number Five, one of the robots originally designed as war weapons by Nova Laboratories, accidentally gets struck by lightning and starts to have a mind of its own. ""He"" leaves the lab and goes out, the adventures have begun. Number Five becomes very hungry for ""input"" and thinks he is alive. His co-creators want to find him, disassemble him because they think he malfunctions, and the army wants to destroy him. Then Number Five meets a young woman, Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy), and they become friends. After learning about the beauty of life (Remember that butterfly on the truck?) and what death is (After Five unintentionally killed an insect while trying to jump like it), Number Five refuses to be disassembled (which is ""death""). He also ignores his programming because he is aware that killing is wrong.As Number Five gets more and more input there are more and more hilarious moments. But he and Stephanie have to convince Newton Crosby (the robot's co-creator, played by Steve Guttenberg) that Five is ALIVE and has emotions, just like humans. As the ending approaches the plot gets really dramatic and you feel so happy after you watch the whole movie.Number Five is enormously sweet and adorable on one particularly memorable scene which he dances with Stephanie and sings along to ""More than a Woman"". What a lovely and delightful masterpiece! I take my hat off to the entire cast (Tim Blaney was splendid as the voice of Number Five) and crew for their tremendous hard work. The film is followed by a fabulous sequel.",Short Circuit

61,DJ_Shilo,Too many Short Circuits to be a good movie,4,10 May 2016,"May 9, 2016Number 5 is a cute robot and brought to amazing life through special effects, however, I'm a little confused as to how this is a kids film? It's full of foul language, even from the robot and it got a real dark sense of humor that is more likely to scare kids that entertain them. Number 5 is a cute character when he is not shooting at something with his laser and when his eyes are blood shot red.It's about a series of prototype robots called S.A.I.N.T.S. (Strategic Artificially Intelligent Nuclear Transport) that are built by NOVA Laboratories. Newton Graham (Steve Guttenberg) is the designer of the robots and he disagrees with the companies agenda of using the robots for the Cold War. Number 5 is hit by a lightning storm and has his programming scrambled which gives him a sense of free will and he becomes intelligent. The Robot escapes the facility and ends up on the run with, Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy ) while a team of agents are in hot pursuit to recover the robot as his laser is still armed.Number 5 is a battlefield weapon. He moves and talks like a real person and has a strong intelligence he gathers from reading through books at lightening speed. His metallic body and impressive facial structure make him an interesting character to look at. The picture opens with a demonstration of the robots using lasers to blow up several army jeeps. Steve Guttenberg appears as a slack-type brilliant scientist who doesn't like media or press because of the companies intentions with the robots he has made for them. Guttenberg becomes the lucky hero when he must get the robot back before the company he works for loses all their funding.It's got an impressive story but this is a very dark and violent film. Whenever the robot is going to blast something, his eyes turn red and he looks like something nightmares are made of. He has a friendly heart but the army chases him throughout the whole picture and its a gunshot here and a gunshot there. It never rises above a basic premise to give us anything special. It reminded me of ET in the sense that Number 5 is almost like an alien. He is curious and has no assurance of his surroundings. He doesn't know what's going to happen next but he can sense the danger ahead.None of the characters in the picture is interesting except for Ally Sheedy. She is a third major character. She takes care of animals in her home so we can figure out what her personality is but she never does anything in the picture except try to hide the robot until Steve Guttenberg shows up and finally realizes the robot is alive at the last twenty minutes of the movie. When Number 5 shows up on her doorstep, she adopts him thinking he is an alien when she finds him in her ice cream truck. There are a lot of good ideas here but none of them are presented and we're left with a boring premise that showcases Number 5's robotic abilities and the plot never rise above a ""Search & Destroy"" movie that is too dark and violent for kids.",Short Circuit

Short Circuit is part of my youth, I've seen it when I was 13 years old and I simply loved it. It brings some cute ideas from ET, in the shape of a very funny robot that is brought to life (and given human thoughts) after being struck by a lightning. The whole story is very cute, I cannot judge the flaws or the glitches here and there because the target is mainly young people who couldn't care less about those things - and mostly, the ones that you may get to see aren't important. I'm also not judging the actors that much, they do their job just right, in a story that goes around ""Number 5"" or ""Johnny 5"".

78,Deathrow_nzl,MEMORABLE CLASSIC probably the inspration behind WALL-E,8,4 July 2008,"I saw this movie at the pictures This Movie was a Classic back in 1986 I still remember this movie well ""NUMBER 5 IS ALIVE"" I would have been 7 years old when I watch this movie the reason I am guess it has such a low rating. is cause there have been so many movies in this Genre, Over lets say the last 8 years, Including Short circuit ripoff Wall-E http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/ Anyway it doesn't have the awesome graphics Wall-E has cause 3d computer graphics didn't really exist in 1986 Wall-E might even have a slightly better story line But you must remember Short Circuit was the original and did not have 100s of robot friend movies to copy of like wall-e at the time it was made to copy ideas off and revise from, Wall-e received 9 out of 10 Short circuit received 6 out of 10 I feel Short Circuit have been very hard done by for being a old movie. Anyway thats my piece its up to you to make the right choice when you vote.",Short Circuit
79,danielbloome,Johnny 5 is Alive!,10,25 January 2015,"This is a great classic comedy. I know, I know, it's not like it's a brilliant work of cinematic history or anything, and Steve Guttenberg is hardly the greatest actor of his generation, but if you are looking for just a fun movie with some cheap laughs that won't make you think too much, this is a great pick. Especially if it's for the whole family, because Short Circuit is definitely family friendly (for the most part).One thing we didn't appreciate was that Fisher Stevens was playing a silly comic-relief character, a nerdy scientist from India who talks with a stereotypical old Indian accent and just doesn't understand things and is super socially awkward. But I guess that was okay in the eighties.Fun times!",Short Circuit
80,day_dana,"Except for the innuendos, this is worthy of Disney",10,28 September 2005,"I think a better tag line would have been ""Life is not a malfunction."" Yes, the movie is corny - but if you know that going in, you can sit back and enjoy it. The love story is saccharin sweet. The pace of the movie starts out a little slow, but really picks up speed as it goes along - so hang in there. It is fun to see how the writer takes the blank slate of the robot's mind and has it learn and connect concepts. ""Johnny Five"" is as hilarious as any alien ever was. His fresh wise cracks and sense of humor are great, but are secondary to the excellent humor offered by the character Ben. This foreign (?) U.S. native, with his (unintentional?) misuse of the English language with a straight face, is my favorite comedic character in the movie. The story is corny, it's true, but the humor is dry - and that's what I love about it. The only thing I could have done without the implied (sexually oriented) affection between the robot and the heroine. I fear that as time goes on, the jokes based on cultural television program references will be lost on younger generations of viewers.",Short Circuit

Great plot, amazing special effects and alright acting, this is a classic tale of a ""Frankenstein gone right""",Short Circuit

83,rockeymallavia,A surprising gem,8,27 May 2008,"Number 5, the fifth member of a line of super powered killer robots being developed by a defense contractor, is struck by lightning and becomes self-conscious. He then escapes from the research facility and takes up residence with animal lover Stephanie (Ali Sheedy), who recognizes Number 5 for what he is. Newton (Steve Guttenberg), the engineer who developed Number 5, sets out to recover and fix his creation, while other elements in the company have more devious plans in store for Number 5.Its refreshing to finally see a movie in which self-aware robots aren't trying to kill us or take over the earth. Number 5 wouldn't harm a fly, and his only objective in life seems to be acquiring ""more input."" He's adorable, and the film delves into surprisingly deep themes, such as what it means to be alive, and whether or not the spontaneous generation of life as an ""accident"" somehow cheapens its value. Afterall, if you believe in evolution, didn't all life on Earth arise by chance? The movie is somewhat cheesy in that its villains are one dimensional, and their actions and motives are apparent a mile away.Overall, if you are looking for a light-hearted comedy that will shock you at times with its depth and thoughtfulness, you will enjoy this film.",Short Circuit

If you know why, please enlighten me.Anyway, I spent my childhood growing up to movies. This has always been a favorite of mine. This movie has everything a family movie should have: comedy, romance, a lovable character everyone can relate to in some way, and also the greatest line of all: ""Well, if you gotta go, don't squeeze the Charmin."" OK, I'm kidding on that last one, but everything else is true. Number 5 is one of the most lovable characters anyone could have hoped to invent. To think this movie started out as a thriller! Just imagining that gives me chills. I could never see Number 5 as anything but the funny little robot he is! Oh, wait. He's not a robot. HE'S ALIVE!!!!!",Short Circuit

The scene with the girl's nut case boyfriend is classic (I won't ruin it for you). The scene in the yard where Johnny learns about death for the first time was very, very, well done. This is one of those situations where the sequels were as good as the first one and not just the same old rehashed stuff. I'd get this movie for my ten year old if they wanted it but even the adults will find something thought provoking in it. Very enjoyable. Must be one of the first movies where anyone tried to shoot a movie using a robot and not just stop action animation or some such.",Short Circuit

If he was with me and my mates all the time I would die! and so would they. he has been my friend for ages! and If there is one thing I learnt whilst watching Short Circuit of Short Circuit 2 is that I will always love Johnny 5 and no matter what I will never stop loving him of forget him like I done. (I saw it when I was little and after a couple of years I saw it a gen and thank god!)

I even remember a lot of the lines from this movie. Fisher Stevens was a joy, especially when he was standing by the truck and said, ""I am so excited I am standing beside myself!"" Steve Guttenburg was a dream. Ally Sheedy was just made for the part of Stephanie. I work with a young woman named Stephanie and every time I see her, I say her name the same way that Johnny Five said it in the movie....Steph...a...nee! I will watch this movie over and over again.

88,Liberal_Libra1981,All About Ben!!!,8,6 January 2005,"As cute as Number 5, Steve Guttenberg, and Ally Sheedy were in this movie, the greatest character was Ben! His witty ""I don't get it"" comments are hilarious. ""Plus, we are needing gas money."" Also funny, is all of the Number Five takes on Saturday Night Fever. Overall, this movie is 80's fluff, but we all loved 80's fluff at some point. Though fluffy, it does touch on some serious subjects such as military weapon usage, animal rights, and abuse. Howard Marner and Schroeder make good villains, and Guttenberg and Sheely have a very cute love/hate chemistry. Very lovable and adorably funny. And if robots don't interest you, just watch it for the Ben quotes!",Short Circuit

90,grayorca,I still love this one today,10,25 May 2005,"I practically grew up watching this one. And this film is two years older than I am. Number Five has long been a movie personality I grew to adore, as well as his human co-actors. There has never been a time where I have watched and not smiled at it's quirky verbal humor. I have recommended it to many acquaintances looking for a good, old 80's comedy. The sequel is not quite as up there, but I also keep it mixed in with my favorite DVDs. For any science fiction fan, it can be seen as a classic and prelude to movies such as ""I, Robot"".10 out of 10 is my rating because this movie has played a great part in my movie-watching life. I first saw it at the age of 9 (edited Disney broadcast version, with the adult language cut out) and have looked to it ever since if I just want to get a little laugh. And, for me, a little laugh in my otherwise stressful life is a great thing.10/10",Short Circuit
91,bbuitendijk,Sparkling movie,10,25 January 2007,"This is one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen. Number 5 is so cute. And his interaction with Stephany Speck (Ally Sheedy) is great (Loveley Software). It contains lots of references to other movies. Just look closely and you might discover a hidden reference to one of your favorite movies. It is a subtle combination of humor, thriller (a diamond robbery) and the very dramatic struggle of Number Five to understand what live is. Steve Guttenberg as Newton Crosby does a convincing job of a genius who doesn't understand what live is. His point of view is diametrically opposed to Stephanie's and their consequent interaction just sparkles. It contains jokes for both children and parents. Perhaps that's one of the things which makes it so enjoyable.",Short Circuit

Having re-watched recently, the magic's sorta worn off, but it was still an excellent film. You will thoroughly enjoy this if you like the idea of a humanised robot with real emotions. It's sorta funny to note how both #5 and Stephanie are slightly naive, and how #5 translates everything into computer language. upon walking in on Stephanie in the bath ""nice software!"" lmao. Also while kids while easily identify Skroeder as the bad guy, adults and teens will recognise how he has basically become more of a machine than the robots he works with because of his inhumanly cold, ruthless attitude.",Short Circuit

My son who is epileptic and has ADHD and high functioning autism sat through the WHOLE film, it was a wondrous joy to hear him squeal with delight, nearly uncontrollably, and i found myself in tears when the fake #5 that Johnny 5 built was blown up, as i saw my sons reaction, because he thought it was the real one, then he cheered in the end when Johnny 5 showed up from under the truck with Steve Guttenberg and Alley Sheedy. They begged me to watch it again after it was over, but it was bedtime so I promised them that they could watch it in the morning. Great movie for kids! 10 out of 10!",Short Circuit

Then proceeded to watch every showing that day at that theater, on both screens. I do not think I've ever found such a movie that truly entertained..that was not offensive..that you wouldn't have a problem letting kids see.The only thing that sort of is upsetting was after this first movie. There was to be a sequel that had all the original cast in it..but it never made it to theaters in time. Where that copy is I have no idea. What was called the sequel...should have been kept under wraps.I really do wish they would revisit the idea of a sequel for Number 5...this is one robot that deserves another chance at a far better script than what he was given in the 2nd movie.But going back to the original. Very good job for his supporting cast. Steve and Ally were excellent. I don't think they could have picked better to be in this movie. I still see, and still laugh at the ex boyfriend getting his boot heels shot off...his belt and brim of his hat...the look on his face as he saw his precious car taken apart...not Number 5's fault he had left the Chilton manual in the car...:) :) :) This movie is truly an original tale, very well told, and will stand out as an excellent piece for a long time to come.",Short Circuit

Although we all knew it was metal and wires - admit it, how many were a little choked up when they thought Johnny Five was a gonna? OK, I admit, I was. Although the film has some similarities to ET, the robot comes out more adorable with his little quirks and comments when he is bought to life by the magic of Tim Blaney's voice than the rubber glove puppet. Credit must be given to the casting - Fisher Stevens who played Ben Jabituya was absolutely superb with Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg both putting in excellent performances.Let's see some bigger votes and give this movie the rating it deserves!",Short Circuit

Protecting the environment, the value of having friends and trust them, tolerance, fool cops who believed their guns would kill good feelings, and so on, Steven Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy were unforgettable. The cops play their roles fine, specially the crazy sargent. I would like to add that the pictures are amazing. First, the bridge by sun dawn, the bay and the clean roads. Second, the young man who is running with his pants down, allow us notice the importance of being far away from greed. Third, values such as classic music will never be old.

98,allan-gh,"Underrated by some of you, and overrated by me.",10,23 May 2007,"I deliberately overrated this movie for one reason, and one reason only: My children's reaction to seeing it the first time.I remember this movie from the 80's. It was cutesy and cheesy and all of that, but it was a relaxing movie to watch. It simply entertained--simply. Fisher Stevens is the actor whom I remember as defining all that was fun in the film.4 nights ago, I watched my children in amazement, as they voiced appreciation of and approval for virtually all that I found worthy in the movie. Yes, there are some ""language moments"" that I wish were not there, but these are--compared to real life--light weight moments. My children have (unfortunately) heard far worse at school and in the check out line at the grocery store.At any rate, this movie is old enough to be new, and my children laughed themselves silly for most of it.My youngest daughter's favorite line? ""Bimbo!"" Watch the movie to 'get it.'",Short Circuit
99,jgfairman2,"Fun, iconic childhood film",8,4 February 2006,"As a child of the 80's, I first saw the movie growing up as a kid (came out when I was 3). Whereas I've watched it several times, I haven't seen it in its entirety for at least 15 years, give or take some. Watching it again tonight, and I was blown away. Whereas it is true that both Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy play tired roles (the liberal cat lady and the insanely dorky scientist), as an insanely dorky scientist myself (or at least a grad student) the funniest moments are Fisher Stevens' comments about adult-related humor that I just now get. As Guttenberg is discussing the meeting in the bar with Stevens, I'm rolling on the floor laughing, because I know guys who talk like that...The film does have tons of what I'd like to call ""fuzzy logic"" to it, as well. The CEO of the company obviously would have had control over his security, even as pencil-necked as he was. They would not simply go out and try to destroy a 11 million dollar investment willy-nilly, or come out with a military option again and again if it kept failing (which it did, several times). The scientist in me screams against the stupidity of the security force destroying the experiment, whatever it may have been.However, the movie stands on its own two feet. Sure, it's a relative hack job at parts. But, it's fun, it gets into some issues in a backwards sense. It takes a large leap at the moment where No. 5 becomes able to think abstractly, considering the problems that abstraction has been having in computer programs, but that's going to be given considering that they're screenwriters.An iconic child's film, worth seeing again for those in their twenties now.",Short Circuit
100,simonperera2000,Underrated,9,25 July 2005,"I'm sorry, I can't see why this film has been given such a low rating. This film is wonderfully life-affirming through the character of robot Jonny 5 (the scene where he realises what it means to be alive through crushing a grass hopper is beautifully portrayed), Ally Sheedy brings a bucket load of positive energy to the character of the naive but loving Stephanie, and to top it all there is a subtle but powerful comment on American militarism. There is a real emphasis on quality screen writing here which only comes through on a small ratio of films. The characters could easily have become 2 dimensional stereotypes, but instead given some interesting dialogue and motives (science, military etc). Yes it is cheesy, and I think many people label it as a cheap and tacky 80's movie, but having watched it again recently I think history may well judge it a minor classic.",Short Circuit
101,crabbgrace,Great Kids Film,7,4 October 2016,"In simplistic terms, kid movies are cute; they can make people of all ages laugh (occasionally cry even) and they evoke a feeling of happiness deep inside that can stir up the inner-kid voice in any individuals' heart. In 1986, ""Short Circuit"" was released. It is the tale of a robot strictly made for military purposes who happens to get struck by lightning and afterwards develops human-like characteristics. As he becomes self-aware, the robot (named Number Five) escapes the NOVA laboratory compound, now on the run from the scientists he fears will capture and ""kill"" him. ""Short Circuit"" certainly captured my heart and it should be recommended to everyone looking for an enjoyable movie filled with many opportunities for a good laugh. Alas, besides being a ""cutesy"" movie, ""Short Circuit"" doesn't contain much depth or intricacy after that; the three main supporting characters are simple, with only a single defining characteristic to their personalities and the plot follows a very basic structural outline.Stephanie, Newton, and Skroeder are the three main supporting characters that were mentioned above; more or less, they are flat, 2-D characters. Stephanie is an animal pacifist; her only role is to show Number Five some compassion and protect him from harm. Newton is a scientist, so his character role is to track down Number Five, study him, and make sense of these human-characteristics. And finally, Skroeder is the ultimate brawn behind the capture mission so his only role is to annihilate Number Five. Each character represents a single idea and solely keeps to that lone idea throughout the entire film; thus there are no other significant characteristic differences between the characters. Likewise, the plot is quite similar: it is not overly complex by any means and really only follows an easy, skeletal outline. There's an initial event that takes place in the beginning and that event is followed by a cat-chase-mouse action sequence which lasts nearly the entire movie. It's very similar to the television cartoon, ""Tom and Jerry."" The cartoon is based upon a cat, Tom, chasing a mouse, Jerry; likewise, Skroeder and Newton chase after Stephanie and Number Five. Then, at the very end of the movie, there is (of course) a happily ever after resolution causing the film to leave a warm and pleasant feeling in the watchers' heart. ""Short Circuit"" is a simple story of the ""good guys vs. the bad guys,"" with the moral of the story being: all life is important and it's erroneous to kill. If you happen to be searching for a movie with an overly deep plot and complex characters, you'll want to look elsewhere. ""Short Circuit"" is a humorous, lovable, simplistic kids' movie. Should anything more than that be expected of it?",Short Circuit
102,drjcheung,Epic classic!!,9,23 November 2019,I don't understand the low rating! So many newer robot movies pay homage to Johnny 5...he's one of the OG robots. A good old fashion clean comedy that tugs at your heart strings.,Short Circuit
