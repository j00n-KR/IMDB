0,TheLittleSongbird,Frustrates more than it intrigues,4,1 August 2017,"There was a good film somewhere in 'The Circle' that sadly almost never comes out. You couldn't argue with a cast this talented, though there were admittedly reservations about Emma Watson and Ellar Coltrane. And the premise was absolutely fascinating, touching on themes that are relevant today and important.As a film, 'The Circle' is certainly not awful but it is sad that a film with so much potential frustrates more than it intrigues. It is not a complete waste and there are merits. Most of the cast do fare well. The best performance comes from Bill Paxton, moving doesn't describe adequately his heart-breaking turn as Mae's multiple sclerosis-riddled father, a more physical role than verbal in showing the latter stages of MS and it comes over incredibly realistically. Close behind is a sympathetic Glenne Headly, her mother figure full of maternal warmth and sympathetic sincerity. Unfortunately both died not long after, both sudden and both were and still are very sad losses. They were the only characters that one feels anything for throughout.Not to say that they are the only good actors. Despite being underused, with the character not featuring in the film for a quite long stretch, Tom Hanks makes a valiant effort and brings a lot of much needed charisma and energy whenever he appears. Patton Oswalt is similarly good and Karen Gillan is a breath of fresh air in her scenes.Some of 'The Circle' doesn't look too bad, it's nicely shot with some lovely locations, especially in the otherwise fairly repetitive and pointless kay-acking scenes.However, although not a detractor of her work, Emma Watson is woefully miscast, and the come and go accent is the least of the performance's problems. She tries far too hard with some very overwrought dialogue delivery, while seeming stiff and ill at ease in the speeches (a far cry from Hanks' delivery of his introductory scene which had me and my sister glued to the screen and on the edge of our seats), her grief doesn't ring true due to a lack of genuine emotion and she came over as too smug, aloof and self-congratulatory at the end. Despite Watson's miscasting, she fares a little better than Ellar Coltrane, found him uneven in 'Boyhood', here he was terrible in one of the most painfully amateurish performances seen recently as a barely-in-it plot device character. John Boyega has nothing to do other than look moody, a waste of a hugely promising rising star.While there are a few elements of the production values that work, 'The Circle' looks a little too gloomily lit and there is a lack of fluidity in the editing. Don't remember a single note from Danny Elfman's score, which is one of his most generic and eminently forgettable efforts. James Ponsoldt's direction is very slack, which badly affects the never-coming-to-life pacing.Found a lot of the script stilted, over-complicated (with an overload of technical jargon that confuses and alienates the viewer) and self-indulgent. It also tries to touch on the relevant and important theme of the dangers of media, the internet and technology but instead approaches it in a way that talks down to the viewer and uncomfortably condescends. Tonally, it's muddled, trying to be a psychological thriller, drama with a George Orwell and '1984' influence, philosophy and workplace coming-of-age drama, and never really succeeds at any of them.It's just too half-hearted and half-baked in delivery with as aforementioned convoluted and shoe-horned technical jargon. What it tries to say about the theme it addresses is nothing new or enlightening and has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The philosophical elements are far too simplistic and the workplace/coming-of-age scenes are too few and almost irrelevant.Unfortunately, it fares just as badly in the story. It's often incredibly dull and repetitive with a fairly incoherent beginning before Hanks shows up. The whole totalitarian and evil intentions of the tech company are blatantly obvious too early and beaten around the viewer's heads, their actions (especially the finding people in 20 minutes or less) are highly improbable too. The death scene was poorly edited, cheap, hollow and manipulative and the climax seemed to contradict the film's dangerous and unsubtle messaging. Only the scenes with the parents have any emotion or ring true, wish there was more of them.Overall, a missed opportunity that could have been good if executed right. 4/10 Bethany Cox",The Circle
1,SnoopyStyle,heavy-handed,3,3 September 2017,Mae Holland (Emma Watson) gets a customer service job at the social tech company The Circle with help from childhood friend Annie (Karen Gillan). Her best friend Mercer hates modern social media. Her father (Bill Paxton) struggles with MS and her mother (Glenne Headly) struggles with medical insurance. The Circle is run by the charismatic leader Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks). Ty Lafitte (John Boyega) is a mysterious non-conformist in the open-interconnected company.This is rather heavy-handed in the subject matter. It's fine to expand on the senator but she's only a way-station. Mae takes a turn that is unfair. There is a climatic incident that is beyond manufactured. It tries to be a big-subject movie but it gets overwhelmed by it. It needs to pick a smaller target to extrapolate on the bigger issue.,The Circle
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Come on guys, it really wasn't that bad",6,14 September 2017,"I must say I am pretty surprised by the bad reception this film received mostly, but first things first. ""The Circle"" is an American English-language film from 2017, so a new release we got here and the writer and director is James Ponsoldt, who has some films in his body of work that are really good like ""Smashed"" one of my very favorite films from 2012. And while this 2-hour film here is not as good, it still made for a pretty decent watch overall. It starts slightly weak, but quickly gets better by the minute. Lead actress is Emma Watson and while she may not be as great of an actress as her looks are, she is still pretty talented. You will see more familiar faces like Tom Hanks of course and also a special mention to Patton Oswalt who may not have a lot to work with here, but definitely made the most of it and created a fairly memorable antagonist with his face expressions and body language. Watson is in almost every scene of the movie and carried it nicely all the time. Are there doubts about the realism of her rise? There certainly are. Her catching the camera early on, her rafting accident becoming so special, her being picked to go under (almost) 24/7 surveillance, her constant running into the creator etc. The way she tricked the bad guys at the end was maybe not too realistic either, but tolerable, reminded me a bit of ""The Wave"". I liked the way how she lured Oswalt's character to the stage, even if it is hard to believe he was in charge of all the light and electricity there etc. Still makes him even more special somehow.Anyway, even if you cannot call it the most realistic film of the year 2017, it is still damn entertaining and also brings a message that is worth sharing. I am not talking about the idea that surveillance is bad. I am talking about the idea that you may want to communicate with other people in person. I liked the scene early on, in which the protagonist says she will text the young male character when to meet again instead of simply deciding right away. The ways in which the parents were included worked nicely as well and gave this film interesting supporting characters too. But while the treatment for them, the comments about avoiding rape and murder and the ways in which criminals can be located quickly may seem like positive aspects to some extent, the film takes sides against the cause of these developments from the very start. The Circle are the bad guys (from the job interview on), Coltrane is the good guy, but Watson's character has a long way to go before she realizes. The more fans and followers she gains, the more her personal relationships turn into a mess. I liked about the film that Watson is never shown as power-hungry or anything, just enjoying the attention, even if the situation spirals out of control more and more, eventually with deadly consequences. And I also liked that the bad guys were not depicted as Nazis or some cult or religious group or anything. It was really all about business, greedy businessmen at the top of it, who don't believe in their project, but believe in the money they make with it.There are a couple other minor struggles I had with the film like that it could have ended with them heading out of the auditorium right away, but I guess they wanted Watson right in the middle of it on her own, so they included a bit of an epilogue eventually. I haven't read the book this one is based on, but judging merely the movie I enjoyed it for the most part. It's no best of the year material and it will probably not get that much awards recognition overall, but that's alright. It's far from the failure some make it out to be. As for people criticizing the age of the creator, look at Zuckerberg when he launched his empire. And it also feels real that the businessmen would take over selling the initially interesting concept with their charisma (Hanks) and turning it into an abomination. Another thing I liked were the chat comments by the viewers that were truly spot-on. On a more negative note, the film is a bit jumpy. We have the election reference, we have all these camera references and then in the end there is something about car safety and there were really no transitions or elaborations on the previous projects anymore. Not a perfect film, but I was still close to giving it an even higher rating than the three stars out of five that I eventually settle with. Definitely recommend the watch.",The Circle
3,claudio_carvalho,A Messy American Black Mirror Ripoff Feature,5,26 August 2017,"""The Circle"" is a confused and shallow film about bad use of technology or a messy American Black Mirror ripoff feature based on the concept of George Orwell ""1984"". Tom Hanks is one of the best American actors; the promising Emma Watson from Harry Potter became also a good actress and is a reality now; Glenne Headly; Bill Paxton; Karen Gillan, among others, have also good performances but are wasted in the mess of ""The Circle"". The story about the danger of lack of privacy in a world permanently monitored and controlled by a powerful corporation is shallow and silly. The theme could have been better explored since we are close of this dangerous situation of living under surveillance of growing number cameras in the great cities under the argument of governments of improving safety and protection of the citizens. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""O Círculo"" (""The Circle"")",The Circle

Tom Hanks is its personable creator and boss. Emma submits herself to a social experiment to live an open life wearing a tiny camera.The film examines in an over-the-top manner when Big Brother is a company who claims mankind can achieve best when they share knowledge and have no secrets. The development of the relationship of Mae and Ty (John Boyega) was not well developed. Emma Watson and Tom Hanks brings their 'A"" game, but the script was full of wholes and they couldn't make it real.Guide: 1 F-word that I caught. Old people having sex. no nudity",The Circle
5,kosmasp,Entertained yet?,6,17 September 2017,"Imagine Jim Carrey doing Truman ""willingly""?! Actually you don't really have to imagine that hard. If you think about it, it already started. We are visible almost everywhere. The question is, does someone really want to follow one person around that much? Is one person that interesting? Not to mention the creepiness involved in all that.So everybody can be a ""reality"" Internet star nowadays. And the fact we are accessible and everybody can see us, is a big part of this story. It's also nice to see Bill Paxton in this, stretching his acting muscles in a small role. And while I haven't read the novel (I can only imagine that it is way better), I do think this is doing a decent job overall. Not great, but not bad either (for someone who can't compare it to the source material) ...",The Circle
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Made me raise an eyebrow.,6,11 June 2018,"I got the impression that the team behind it were a fan of Black Mirror, and planned a movie in the style of Charlie Brooker. The idea that technology in the near future can have devastating effects on people, but also make you wonder, what if.The production values are good, it's a fairly slick looking movie, performances are pretty good, Watson, Hanks and Gillen allbpretya good. It's somewhat forgettable, but it's certainly a film that makes you wonder if the way our society is going will lead to privacy being lost, and invasion getting out of hand.It's not a wow by any stretch of the imagination, but it's worth a look. 6/10",The Circle
7,lee_eisenberg,don't trust the powerful,5,4 December 2019,"Every story of a tech company misusing people's personal information makes ""The Circle"" look all the more realistic. It's not a great movie, but still a warning about all that stuff. The fictional company in the movie comes across as positively cult-like.",The Circle
8,Quinoa1984,only people with a lot of talent could pull off something so misguided,4,28 April 2017,"I think I can see why James Ponsoldt, who previously took on and made excellent films out of young-troubled love (The Spectacular Now) and what it means to meet a mind that is brilliant and unusual (The End of the Tour, one of those dramatic films that can still be underrated on a top ten list), wanted to take on the material from Dave Eggers book. I haven't read it, but one can tell this is a story filled with a megaton of ideas and ambition. If anything I think it's the latter part, the ambition of this quasi-present-day dystopian world where this one big company that works a little wee bit like a cult (but like a Shinny Happy People Cult(TM) that people can sink their teeth into, lacking the cynicism and nastiness one usually or should sees on social media), where a character enters in and becomes immersed and loves it, only to find out all is not what it seems.Sadly, it's a mess. But I don't think it could've been made if Ponsoldt didn't have the talent of a) seeing how to cast (mostly) the right actors, and b) there's flashes of brilliance here. I think early on I was a little worried that perhaps he had gone too... not challenging enough as a director, from the music score (which is atypical techno garbage that's too emphatic throughout) to camera moves and cutting. But there's a moment where Emma Watson's Mae is at her desk at The Circle, where she's a customer service person of some sort, and these two Very Shiny Happy Employees come over and ask her in a nice yet surely pushy way why she hasn't updated her social media account or checked her emails and gone to events, which, as they say, are ""totally not mandatory, optional, y'know"" etc. It's an extremely funny scene and one that is painfully awkward, because it feels like something that would happen there, and at the same time it gives us a window into what the personalities are like there. I wish there was more of this kind of scene in the movie, but there isn't.There's so much potential with the ingredients here; we're in a world where screenings of 1984 were sold out across the country in one-night limited release this past month, and there's even a mention (ironic coming from Patton Oswalt's character, who seems like a ""Bad Cop"" version of Hanks's ""Good Cop"" head of the company) of claiming the US government is talking in ""double-speak"" when it comes to going after the Circle for anti-trust violations). And though I wasn't sure while watching it, I can say after sitting here writing this review that Watson is fine as this lead character. Does she become a bit over-zealous as she leap-frogs from customer service rep to a quasi-social media guru at this company (after she does an odd 'I need to break free' moment in the middle of the night where she goes... kayaking)? Sure. She's not exactly likable, but that could be interesting.Again, there's a lot to explore with people, large groups of them, and we see it today on Instagram and Facebook and elsewhere - ever see those ""stories"" people make, it's not unlike the ""Transparent"" state Mae tries out as she documents every moment of her life to, somehow, millions watching all over the world (how exactly she is so interesting, aside from working at the Circle, for this to happen, I'm not so sure) - and I was half or more expecting this all to lead to some sinister revelations that Hanks/Oswalts characters are hiding. Nope. The giant f***-up that leads to what we call the ""2nd turning point"" in screen writing comes through something involving Mae's friend Mercer (Coltrane, the painful sore thumb of this cast, not being able to sell any of his brief moments on screen) and the ENTIRE world it seems like. And even that makes so little sense.Matter of fact, a lot doesn't make sense in The Circle (i.e. ANYTHING to do with politics). I have to wonder if this was Ponsoldt not knowing how to consolidate Eggers material with the writers, or if the movie was taken out of his hands and if chunks of the narrative are missing to make an under-2-hour run-time. But most especially an egregiously, the third act, following the turning point with Mercer, is so rushed and ham-fisted and... did I mention DUMB as to ruin a lot of good-will I was building up to the movie.There's so much I want to like here, and a lot of scenes fly as far as making some satirical points about the hive-minded nature of the world we're living in which seems to me on-line where everyone is not only fine with giving up something of themselves, but that we enjoy watching ordinary people's travails (depending), not to mention the 'Cloud' aspect that the Circle props up. But it needed to pick a side: is it going to be a dark comic satire, or is it going to be a tech-thriller? It tries to mesh the two together, with a game cast and a lead who begs our sympathy, and it turns out to be a jumble.Lastly... RIP Bill Paxton. A shame this is the movie, let alone with Hanks again as a near-villain, is the one to close out a career on.",The Circle
9,tavm,The Circle was okay for what it was trying to showcase concerning subject matter,5,3 May 2017,"So this is one of those dramas in which privacy is slowly invaded and someone resolves to do something about it. I'm guessing there are shades of 1984 though I've yet to read the book or watch any filmed versions of that one. Performances of Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt, Glenne Headly, the late Bill Paxton, and Emma Watson as the protagonist were okay for what they were. I don't think I felt too much conflict while watching so that may have been a factor in my partially feeling sleepy while watching. I don't know, it probably could have been more exciting. Still, I consider The Circle worth a look, at the least.",The Circle

11,gradyharp,Paranoid? We're already there!,7,12 August 2017,"THE CIRCLE is the suffocating novel written by Dave Eggers who co-wrote the screenplay with director James Ponsoldt. It is difficult to classify the genre – it is not science fiction because it is more reportage of the IT control of our lives. It is not a coming of age novel because that bracket of time (moving from child into adulthood) has been usurped by texting and social media, it most assuredly is not a love story, and it is not an apocalypse tale – because it if about things as they are at the present. THE CIRCLE is about mind control, the extinguishing of privacy that is growing daily, and the stepping away from life as we know it into life as it is so very rapidly becoming – public property and available for manipulation by government and the wealthy powers that can purchase the future illegally.When Mae (Emma Watson) is hired to work for the world's largest and most powerful tech and social media company, she sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. Her parents (mother Glenne Headly who cares for her deteriorating multiple sclerosis husband Bill Paxton) encourage Mae to explore her possibilities to gain employment that can help the dwindling healthcare resources (sound familiar?). Mae finds an entry into the high tech CIRCLE through friend Annie (Karen Gillan) and as she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes, begin to affect the lives and future of her friends (especially Mercer as portrayed by Ellar Coltrane), family and that of humanity. Ultimately Mae's courage and enlightenment result in a dramatic ending that shares at least a ray f hope that such a mind and privacy explosion may have a means to end – or that may just be wishful thinking: money controls.The story would be more interesting (it certainly is well acted) if it were just a possibility resulting form our obsession with IT. But actually it is too close to the truth to respond in any other manner but a deep breath and a sigh that this is where we already are.",The Circle
12,deloudelouvain,That world would be our worst nightmare,7,30 August 2017,"I see the movie clearly divides people, or you immensely dislike it or you are okay with it. I was okay with it, even though it could have been better if they would have add a bit more action. The acting was okay without being great though. Emma Watson's character is one I disliked immediately. For the whole movie I wished something bad would happen to her. But that's how the story makes you think. The story could be our worst nightmare. Well at least it would be mine. A world without any privacy is just a life not worth living. We're not that far yet, but when you think about the social media, the camera's and satellites everywhere, we're not that far from it either. Big Brother is watching you and it's not a good thing. The movie was okay to watch, but it definitely could have been better.",The Circle
13,Hellmant,Bill Paxton does give an amazing final performance in the film!,8,11 May 2017,"'THE CIRCLE': Four Stars (Out of Five) The new techno-thriller starring Emma Watson, Tom Hanks (who also co-produced the movie) and John Boyega (of 'STAR WARS' fame). The film tells the story of a young college student who gets an exciting new job at a successful internet company, but things become too intense when she later learns that the corporation is a huge threat to everyone's privacy. It costars Karen Gillan, Patton Oswalt, Ellar Coltrane (of 'BOYHOOD' fame), Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton (in his final film role). The movie was directed by James Ponsoldt, and it was written by Ponsoldt and Dave Eggers (Eggers also wrote the 2013 novel it's based on). It's received almost unanimous negative reviews from critics, and it's underperformed at the Box Office as well. I somewhat enjoyed the movie, but I agree it is a flawed film too.Mae Holland (Watson) is a young college student that's currently bored with her life, and has to deal with a lot of family drama. She's thrilled to find out that her friend Annie (Gillan) has gotten her an interview at the most successful internet company in America. She lands the job, and things begin going really well. Then she's given an assignment, by the corporation's two co-founders (Hanks and Oswalt), to be completely transparent to all of the company's internet followers (at all times). She at first enjoys the fame and enormous power that the position brings, but when she realizes the experiment is putting everyone's privacy in tremendous danger, she realizes it's something that she can't continue. The corporation doesn't want her to stop though.The movie is another great idea for a film, that isn't fully developed well. I enjoyed a lot of it actually, and found the movie to be very insightful about the constantly advancing technological world we all live in. It presents a great argument about both the benefits and the dangers, that being completely transparent (and constantly oversharing everything) can bring to people and our society. I think oversharing can be a really positive thing (that's why I frequently do it), and the film does make this argument well. It also presents the downside of being overly transparent too though, and I don't think it really takes one side or the other (in my opinion). Some of the characters and plot points are really poorly developed though. It's a really ambitious movie, that had a lot of promise, but it does fall a little short. Bill Paxton does give an amazing final performance in the film (on the positive side) as well though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/217879519",The Circle
14,Robert_duder,Such incredible potential lost in a mess of editing or lack thereof,6,30 April 2017,"Ironically I work for a tech company that if you really bent and twisted could look a little like The Circle only way less evil...I swear... The Circle seems incredibly timely and you know 30 years from now, even as campy as it ended up being, it could be considering a classic ahead of it's time simply because it has such a pertinent message to our world right now. It could be this generations social commentary. Unfortunately for this movie it is completely lost in very poor character development, some really horrid acting and line delivery, a weak and unedited script, a horrible use of star Tom Hanks and forcing Emma Watson to try and hide her British accent meaning she has not enough lines to give her character depth. Even still, for some reason I didn't hate the film. I still found enough about it that I liked. The idea and concept behind The Circle is very believable and the tech they use while it seems a little outlandish is incredibly real. If you stop and think about Facebook/Twitter/Amazon/The Cloud things that connect the entire world, this film is not even remotely far-fetched. I do believe Emma Watson has it in her to be a star. Fortunately for her Beauty and The Beast and it's 1B+ take will solidify her in Hollywood because it seems everything else she has tried falls flat. I don't think film makers are casting her correctly. She looks through this entire film like she is struggling with hiding her British accent. The dialog is really bad so it hurts her performance even worse. Still I like what they did with it, even if there wasn't enough time to really dig into her. Tom Hanks is the driving star power and is sorrowfully underused. Even still he comes onto screen and makes every scene he's in worthwhile. He's perfect as a low level villain of sorts who is more than close to real life. Ellar Coltrane might be one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Is this guy even an actor? As Watson's childhood best friend and sort of a focal point for Watson's development, he delivers his lines like a terrible Grade School actor. He is absolutely terrible and that is in addition to how bad the dialog is. His chemistry with Watson is literally non-existent. Glenne Headly, the late (amazing) Bill Paxton and Karen Gillan give the three best performances in the film. Paxton who plays Watson's father riddled with MS is fantastic! Similar to Hanks, Patton Oswalt is very underused as Hanks' partner in The Circle. He seems almost to have had his lines removed. And then you have John Boyega (you know the latest star of Star Wars) in an utterly pointless bizarre role where he stands in the back of rooms and looks broody. You would literally think they edited out huge portions of his character making it seem weird and disjointed.I'm not sure who is responsible for ruining a film with such amazing potential. I know that director and co-writer James Ponsoldt does not have enough experience to handle something of this potential calibre. I would presume that Dave Eggers original novel is much better and I feel like it's probably a lot of editing and cooks in the kitchen that killed this adaptation. I still liked a few performances, I loved the message and working in the tech world for me it really was a little on the scary side. It's worth seeing but probably forgettable but the message behind it will likely cause it to stand the test of time. 6.5/10",The Circle
15,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Sadly undelivering current affairs thriller,4,9 July 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBored with her desk-bound office job, Mae (Emma Watson) gets her friend to pull a few strings, and lands a job at prestigious tech firm The Circle. She is soon welcomed as one of the family, and finds her colleagues eager to help her use all the technology on hand to improve her life for the better. She also comes to the attention of Bailey (Tom Hanks), the CEO of the organization, who sees potential in her. But another co-worker, Ty (John Boyega) opens her eyes to just how invasive The Circle is set to become. As Mae becomes more ruthless and rises up the ranks, it sets her on a collision course of events, in which her morality and ethics will be tested to the limit.Given recent scandalous revelations, concerning Facebook (which 'The Circle' is none too subtly meant to represent!) and its mishandling of private information of its users, involving the Cambridge Analytica firm, The Circle has hit on an inspired concept for a film, and one which is certainly timely and relevant. Indeed, it looks like one or two of my 'friends' have permanently logged out now, probably because of it, and so we're having these slightly grovelling adverts being run at the moment, trying to reassure everybody that they're going to make their settings easier to unblock, and there's nothing to worry about anymore. Unfortunately, despite the great concept, this film sadly fails to really do it any justice.
Hanks was quite a big name for Netflix to pull, even if he may be entering the Autumn of his career now, and his star is slightly waning. But with this in mind, it's even more amazing how little screen time he seems to occupy, at least in the first half. But even so, his character just ends up coming off as really corny, without any solid conviction. As a more fresh faced star, Watson fits the modern tech world scene a bit more smoothly, but the crazed cult-like world she enters just comes off as silly rather than creepy. But it sets the tone for the film in general, which despite its interesting idea, is for the most part just totally unengaging and strangely dull, with characters spouting ridiculous, wordy dialogue that doesn't feel real at all.
In spite of everything, weirdly you do feel compelled to find out how it will end, which at least means it never feels tired or predictable. But then it does roll by, and its the most corn-fed, saccharine laden, nonsensical drivel you can imagine, an ill-fitting pay off to a film of enormously wasted potential. **",The Circle
16,bowmanblue,A star-studded 'Black Mirror',7,6 July 2018,"The darkly sci-fi TV show 'Black Mirror' is well known for its weekly plots showing us various 'What if?' scenarios regarding the use (or rather MIS-use!) of modern technology in the near future. 'The Circle' feels like it kind of belongs in the 'Black Mirror' universe, although possibly the main 'What if?' question I asked was, 'What if Black Mirror could afford A-list actors for an episode?'In 'The Circle' a young woman (Emily Watson) joins a tech company which is pretty much a hybrid of Google, Facebook and Apple. Everyone who works there is ultra dedicated to the corporate mantra and barely leave the 'campus' as everything they could ever want is at their fingertips. It's headed up by the Steve Jobs-esque mogul, played effortlessly by Tom Hanks. He charming, enigmatic and a natural leader who you can get behind due to his ultra-inspiring rhetoric. But is he a good guy? Our young and naïve intern (or 'guppy' as new employees are 'lovingly' referred to as!) soon realises that there's more going on than she had first thought.The reason I'm dwelling on how much I felt like this was like part of the 'Black Mirror' series, is that some episodes of the show I liked and some I didn't. It seemed my personal preference towards the TV show was based on how quickly I 'got' what they were trying to say. If they managed to keep the show's true meaning a secret until the end, therefore giving some - even small - 'twist element' to the story then I found it left more of a lasting impact on me. However, there were some episodes where it was painfully obvious what they were saying right from the start and, once you knew where it was going, you could almost write the rest of the tale yourself. Unfortunately, despite 'The Circle's' great cast and fine performances (although if you thought that John Boyega was criminally-underused in 'The Last Jedi' then you won't appreciate the minimal screen time he's given here) you kind of can see what they're trying to say here and therefore where the film will go.I certainly didn't hate 'The Circle.' The calibre of actors on show, plus the stylish was it was shot and the attempt to actually say something relevant about society and the effects modern technology is having on us and where we may go with it, made it worth a watch. However, with all that it had going for it, I would have liked to see it going a little further and being a little less predictable with its story.I haven't read the book it was based on, so I can't compare the two. However, I understand that it wasn't as well-received during its US theatrical release as the producers would have liked. I guess one indication of what you should expect from this film is the fact that the film-makers then chose not to give it a UK cinema release, instead opting for a 'straight-to-Netflix' launch. of course if you have the popular streaming service then you're technically getting it as part of your subscription, in which case, you should probably add it to your 'watch-list.'",The Circle
17,dromasca,life in the Circle,7,19 June 2017,"The ""Circle"" in Eggers' novel and Ponsoldt's film is the name of a Silicon Valley company, an imaginary success story, but in which we easily recognize the profile, structure, and way of operating of giants of the hi-tech industry such as Google , Apple, or Facebook. The ""Circle"" is more than just a name, it is also a concept on which the entire ecosystem of the company's products is based. The whole world is connected to the Circle. Users have unlimited access to information, and user information is limitless and accessible to all. The company has an enormous success, over 80% of the entire population of America and significant percentages of the world's population are part of the Circle. So pervasive is the company that a proposal to turn the US voting system into a mandatory system, based on enrolling all citizens as company's clients does not seem displaced. In the end - ""Knowing is good. Knowing everything is even better."" This is one of the company's slogans. Really? The circle is a perfect geometric shape and its perfection attracts the creators of identity symbols. But the circle is also a closed geometric shape, no matter how large its radius is. The circle is a symmetric and seemingly democratic geometric shape, but it has a center, and if the center does not play the same rules as the equidistant points on the circumference, then democracy is only apparent. We will recognize familiar themes in the film. One of them, the main one, is the balance between the benefits of permanent communication and its risks for information security and the privacy of Internet users. To Mae Holland, the principal character of the movie, wonderful things seem to happen after she succeeds to be hired by one of the most prestigious Silicon Valley companies. Work is interesting, she is offered permanent (ie 24 hours a day and fully monitored) medical insurance not only for her but also for her father suffering from an evolving degenerative disease that he could not afford to treat by himself, she becomes part not only of a company but also in a complex relationship system that at one point saves her life, she contributes and feels that she makes a difference and can change the world for the better. But what is the price to be paid for these advantages and achievements? Complete abandonment of any intimacy, full 'transparent' exposure of her personal life, family, friends, all under permanent oversight. A meeting with exponential amplification between a social network (again Facebook seems the closest model) and a reality TV show.The secondary but not less acute and actual theme of the film is that of life under permanent pressure in the corporate environment. Positions such as the one in which Mae succeeds to be hired after an unconventional and ruthless interview that seemed to me to be one of the best scenes of the film are among those places dreamed of by almost any resident in this high-density area of ​​advanced technologies in California, and by almost any engineer, programmer, computer and communications expert in the world. The lives of the individuals working in this environment blend with the life of the company, the frontiers between private and professional life are erased, so are working hours, and so are personal priorities.""The Circle"" has so far enjoyed a cool reception from the critics. I also have quite a lot of observations about the directorial vision that seemed to me too flat, missing the opportunity to create an expressive visual image in the ambiance it describes, and about some scenes and secondary characters that use too much a cartoon approach to address real aspects of Corporate life. But as a whole, I liked ""The Circle"". Emma Watson was excellent - ambitious but vulnerable, ready to take personal risks but not to betray her ideals. Tom Hanks outlines the image of the big name industry visionary, including the complexity of leadership task, and adapting to change, but also the dark aspects related to the goals of business environments that ultimately have to generate profit. The film avoids clear positions, viewers are allowed to form their own opinions, and I think that's good, because the issues raised are complex issues that do not all have a single unequivocal answer, and many are still looking for answers.",The Circle
18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,31 July 2017,"The CircleThe downside to working for an innovative tech company is being the first killed by sentient machines.Luckily, the gadgets in this thriller are not nearly as nefarious as their creators.As the newest hire at tech giant The Circle, Mae (Emma Watson) makes quite the impression on the company's co-founders (Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt) by becoming a lab rat for their latest spy-cam technology.Being online all the time, however, takes its toll on Mae, her family (Bill Paxton, Glenne Headly) and her friends (Karen Gillan, Ellar Coltrane) as all of their lives are also televised for public consumption.While it is a timely piece on the loss of privacy, the power of online mob mentality and the digitization of our data, this paranoid Orwellian analogy is tactlessly encrypted with bad acting, outdated discoveries and stock villains.

19,westsideschl,Apple Presage,8,7 August 2017,"Positives: 1. Starts playing off of Apple past, and in this script possibly future fall Apple product launches. Even an imitation of the new Apple circle ""campus"" building is presented. Then it has a sort of Google vibe followed by a Microsoft semblance. Yes, a bit bored at this point, but as you later discover the point of such bland, insipid, nerdy, monotonous, pabulum behavior is to set you up for  2. At 30 minutes the discourse on how much is too much knowledge of everyone's lives by some entity (gov or business) into it's either good for you (whether you want it or not, e.g. think Social Security, perhaps security cameras), or life-changing intrusion. The intrusive devices are implanted chips and small wearable cameras transmitting to the cloud (just servers located somewhere) your every moment of existence. 3. The acting has been panned but I thought it presented the dilemma mentioned above in a slightly exaggerated human parody of those consequences & outcomes. Hanks (an Apple like CEO): At first take I thought was miscast, but as the movie proceeds he performs his (is he sneaky, misleading, misunderstood?) role well. Always impressed with how Watson can so easily lose her Brit accent. 4. Story evolves into how the sharing of this data/knowledge benefits us or harms us. ""If I don't share my experiences with others, have I deprived them of that experience?"" ""If you deprive others of your experiences, you are stealing from them."" ""Access to all human experiences is a basic human right!"" So, by mandate is the world a better place when we see (transparently) everyone's lives without censorship. Think life ""transparencies"" of peoples in China, North Korea shared directly with peoples in Sweden, France, Germany. 5. Story continues to evolve into whether corporate data collection/processing (supposedly more cost efficient than the same under government control) on everyone such as tracking/ensuring voting is the best way to maintain a true democracy. My thought: If everyone votes, but with some casting an unknowledgeable vote might that vote not be worse than not voting at all? 6. In the film the ""transparency"" intrusion leads to a death, but is dismissed as analogous to when a plane crashes we don't stop flying. ""S..t happens."" How do humans respond to such tragedies? Is human nature really just ""ambulance chasers""; consumers of others' suffering Negative: Would have liked more open & intelligent discussion of government or corporate data tracking good/bad consequences.",The Circle

I am concerned on why they would even bother in joining a film with a poor storytelling script. I am not sure if the novel it is based on was better with its socio commentary of human behavior and the use of technology that will film almost anyone and put it up online for others to see. The script, direction, and even the performances are so terrible that it was difficult to sit through the movie. The plot had an interesting concept but was told in a terrible script. It was about a company that hires a lot of young 20 something's to join and listen in on lectures by Earmon (Tom Hanks) about how knowing everything is good. But seeing everything or anyone is better. Such as having many tiny cameras that look likes a ball gadget, which records everything. People can put these cameras in every room in their house. The cameras can be set anywhere out in public. And anyone can have these cameras with them at all times. So when a person can request to look up another. They can find them easily. It does create some problems with people's privacy or can interrupt a person that they do not want to be found. Then, the positives such as they can locate an escaped prisoner that is working amongst us, which no one had a clue about. The film creates a lot of ideas and debates about the idea being good. But the direction is terrible that it never goes over the repercussions about how dangerous invading our privacy can be. That is also one issue with the film as well with the development with Emma Watsons character Mae, who she learns from this and participates in the idea. Until, events turn for the worse that makes her lose her friend who has wanted to be off the grid from being online. In the end, her character never changes with her perspective. The story development ends quickly that they have no idea how to discuss about what happens next with the circle company. The direction was horrible and incoherent. We do not learn much about Mae besides her father played by Bill Paxton is sick with a terminal illness. And she loves to canoe which we see in an opening scene which felt very random and out of place. Her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) gets her into the company but their friendship is slowly affected by Mae's obsession with the idea of surveillance and her other friend Mercer ( Ellar Coltrane) gets distant cause he respects people to have their privacy. The acting was a waste. Do not get me wrong; Tom Hanks, Emma Watson, Karen Gillian, and John Boyega were a waste of talent. They were the only ones that was the highlight of the film. The script had no development to the characters or story. The supporting characters like Karen Gillian and John Boyega were so underdeveloped that they did not impact or contribute anything to the plot besides sharing some screen time. Overall, The Circle was a complete waste of time and talent. It was boring, dull, and the direction of the story and characters were terribly put together.",The Circle
22,zkonedog,Over-arching Message Much Better Than Actual Movie Construction,6,14 August 2017,"In looking at the general reviews for ""The Circle"" (on this site and others), one could surmise it is one of the worst films ever made. I refused to believe this about a movie starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, though, so I finally gave it a chance. What I found is that though the movie is very poorly constructed in terms of plot and pacing, the over-arching themes it revels in are relevant enough to make it an interesting ""what if?"" tale as it pertains to social media.For a basic plot summary, ""The Circle"" sees Mae (Watson) beginning to work at a huge social media/internet/tech company called The Circle, presided over by front man Bailey (Hanks). Imagine a conglomeration of, say, Facebook & Google, and you'd have a rough approximation of The Circle's power/reach. While initially the new position seems almost too good to be true, Mae begins to discover that The Circle may not quite be as innocent or benevolent as it seems.What I liked about ""The Circle"" is how it posits some pretty spot-on (IMHO) scenarios that could happen as social media becomes more and more pervasive (for better or worse) into everyday life. Social media is such a new phenomenon, comparatively speaking, that it is easy to spin stories about its potential breadth over the culture. Will we eventually be voting or paying our taxes 100% online? Perhaps. Will, at some point, one company streamline all the social media platforms (like The Circle's ""True You"" login)? Maybe. These are all interesting questions to think about, and ""The Circle"" does a good job of presenting them in a realistic fashion.That being said, there are also three main problems that really work against this film and prevent it from being a classic in any sense of the word: 1. The Circle isn't presented as an out-and-out villain. While I like this ""shades of grey"" approach, I think it is probably too ""out of the narrative"" for many viewers. Almost exclusively in these cases, it is usually ""big data company"" vs. ""individual rights"". While the movie does indeed go towards that direction, it doesn't explicitly frame it as such.2. Casting Watson may have been a poor choice, actually, because her film/personal acumen leads you to believe (from the minute she is introduced) that she will be ""above it all"" and see through The Circle from Day 1. When this doesn't happen, and continues to not happen, it throws viewers for a bit of a loop. Not fair on Watson's part, but I think the effect does occur.3. There are plot lines throughout the film that are interesting but don't really seem to go anywhere or aren't resolved well enough for solid character viewing. John Boyega plays a character that clearly no one knows what to do with. Mae's friends Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) & Annie (Karen Gillian) should add more to the proceedings than what ultimately transpires. Mae's relationship with her parents (played by Glenne Headly & Bill Paxton) is an intriguing element, but again doesn't get resolved like it should.Essentially, ""The Circle"" is a movie where the nuts-and-bolts execution of the script isn't nearly as compelling as the bigger ideas trying to worm their way out. If viewers can wade past the clumsiness and take a more macro view, this is a film that can be enjoyed.",The Circle
23,eddie_baggins,A huge waste of potential,2,13 November 2017,"What a disappointment.Named as one of my most anticipated films of 2017, for what I thought was good reasoning; solid source material, great director, intriguing cast and potent subject matter, but The Spectacular Now and The End of the Tour director James Ponsoldt's adaptation of Dave Egger's best-selling book of the same name is a mighty letdown of a movie.The Circle really has no right to be as boring and bland as it is but despite the ample talent at its disposal and in many ways highly relevant examination of the Big Brother like world we are quickly becoming, where every move can be watched, tracked and examined, Ponsoldt's film fails to fire in any sufficient way whilst wasting a talented cast in the process.The film looks good in a workmanlike fashion and it feels like it's always going to branch out and become something exciting or at the very least mildly engaging but as Emma Watson's young go-getter Mae takes up a seemingly simple admin job at global technology company Circle, only to find herself caught up with Tom Hanks company head Eamon Bailey, The Circle quickly finds itself caught up in an endless loop of conferences, bad sub-plots involving a sick parent sadly played by the late Bill Paxton (in a role you wish wasn't one of his last) and a narrative that never ends up going anywhere after near 2 hours of running time.The Circle clearly has some hot topic issues at play and wants to examine them in an ultra-hip and subversive way but Ponsoldt's film captures none of the tension or mystery that no doubt helped Egger's book become a fast-selling novel and we never feel invested in Mae's plight as she gets involved in the cult-like world of the Circle's employee group.It doesn't help that Mae isn't exactly the easiest person to warm to, happy to use people to advance her own self-gain and very easily led to do things she clearly isn't keen for, Watson struggles to make Mae work while Hanks doesn't get a lot to do bar a nice take on a Steve Jobs like CEO, whilst Force Awakens breakout star John Boyega may as well have not shown up at all with his character of Ty, a Circle employee who quite clearly doesn't drink the Kool-Aid barely getting a look in, even though he at first seems like a major player in events to come. The less said about Boyhood star Ellar Coltrane's role here as Mae's friend Mercer the better.Final Say – There's no reason to see The Circle, a hugely disappointing film from a director as talented as Ponsoldt and while it may not be the years ""worst"" film its easily one of the year's biggest flops that could've easily been so much more, as this truly is a film that threatens to do a lot but ends up doing nothing at all.1 deer antler chandelier out of 5",The Circle

Featuring numerous, embarrassing scenes of crowds laughing, clapping, oohing and ahhing at some Steve-Jobs-esque speaker presenting a rudimentary new idea as if it's a game-changer speaks to how the film feels about itself. Unfortunately, The Circle is not nearly as clever or important as it thinks it is. More Divergent franchise than Social Network, it's a slick, predictable sci-fi snooze. This story about a tech-company's (think Google, Apple) mysterious control and oversight over its consumers and employees is packed with talent. Written by acclaimed author Dave Eggers (Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius) and directed by talented indie director Ponsoldt (Spectacular Now, End of the Tour), it's a mystery as to what really went wrong here. The tone is a mess, trying to induce both laughs and chills (I think), but never landing either. In front of the camera is a plethora of prestige as well. However, other than Paxton, who gives a great final performance as a man with MS, there's not much to praise. Watson is aloof, Hanks is charming but one-note, Oswalt is out of his element, and Coltrane (the kid from Boyhood) answers the question about whether he can actually act (he cannot). There all stuck trying to make teenage-level, pop-philosophy more interesting than it is (""Guys! Did you know privacy is important?

I have grown up watching these two actors evolve and I always liked both of them since Hanks was an 80's movie star having starred in Big,Splash,A League of Their Own; while Emma Watson I watched her grown up from being a childhood sweetheart starring as Hermoine Granger in her movie debut back in 2001 Harry Potter and I loved her in the remake of Beauty & The Beast. But why oh why did she have to star in this mind-boggling flick. If I had to guess maybe its because she wanted to tell her fans that Technology maybe useful to some but it is a very dangerous tool to use. Watson is like marmite some people like her more loathe her because she is a fresh faced bright young woman who loves to speak her mind.

The movie did a great job of scaring me into the belief that someone is watching me through my phone (but I was already there so..)The actual message that the movie tries to deliver is a bit confusing. It tries to be fair to both sides of the debate on a world that does not want to put down their phones, but the ending does not leave me satisfied, which has a lot to do with the delivery. A lot of good ideas put into the mix with no end game in sight. Tom Hanks is a great actor. The small time he had on the screen, he showed what an amazing performer he can be. Too bad his younger cast members could not say the same thing. In all fairness, comparing Emma Watson with Hanks is, well unfair, but she was the lead in this film and I was not getting anything from her, and I needed something. this movie needed something. Also disappointed with John Boyega, who I've been a fan of since the movie Attack the Block he did many years ago, but once again in all fairness he had a small part in an Emma Watson film, not that it's all her fault that she had to act in a film that seemed like a good story gone wrong.Waste of time.http://cinemagardens.com",The Circle

Emma Watson plays Mae, a tech-savvy youngster stuck in a crappy job doing bill collections via phone. Her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) gets her an interview at The Circle, a big tech company that seems to be an amalgam of Facebook and Google. Needless to say, Mae gets the job. The campus at The Circle would be straight out of science fiction if it weren't for Google's real-life campus - a sort of mix between a college (where no one seems to have classes) and an adult Chuck E. Cheese. There's everything from hot yoga to Quidditch, plus private concerts with acts such as Beck. It's not just a trendy work environment, it's a bleeding edge of hipsterism. The Circle itself is a be-all kind of company, much like Google is, trafficking more in ideas than in material goods. It's run by Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), a stand-in for Steve Jobs, who oozes personality and whose mantra is that sharing is caring and who holds weekly ""dream meetings"" with the entire campus to put forth his new ideas. Naturally, Mae is head over heels for this new job, since it's such a pleasant environment in which to work, and even more so when she learns she can add her parents (Bill Paxton and Glenne Headley) to her insurance - which means that Dad's MS treatments are covered! Doesn't matter that her customer-approval score is ""only"" 84, they like her! And she likes it there! Bailey's new idea is called SeeChange, an initiative to create and deploy tiny camera all over the world so that there are no secrets. Raise any alarms? The cameras come in different colors, so they can blend in almost everywhere! And they'll collect data, relentlessly relaying all of it to Circle HQ for analysis. Crimes can be stopped! People can be helped! The world will prosper! Unlike the audience, Mae and the rest of the staff don't see any problems with this approach. The staff meetings, incidentally, are unbelievable - pep rallies for the boss? For a place that seems to pride itself on innovation, there doesn't seem to be an inquisitive mind in the bunch. It's all awesome to them, especially when Bailey tosses the cameras out into the crowd. It's more of a cult, really. At one point, Mae has a video chat with her mom and notices a homemade chandelier in the background, made by Mae's friend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane). After the call, Mae messages everyone in The Circle (they're very, very big on social networking) and plugs Mercer's work. Turns out to be a bad idea, because he finds himself labeled as a deer killer and receives death threats. Whoops. This doesn't deter Mae, though; she still believes wholeheartedly in Bailey's ideas. Later, she helps come up with a new initiative herself that allows people - using the many SeeChange cameras - to find someone in the world. This can't possibly be used for bad, right? Shenanigans ensue. All of the red flags that popped up would have been recognized by even the dumbest staffer, so it makes zero sense that Mae doesn't grasp what's going on - and what's to come. The bad guys are broadly, broadly written, and every plot point seems equally obvious and ridiculous. There's no good reason for the story to progress past the first half hour or so - there's so much dumbness. And Watson, Hanks, and Gillan, plus John Boyega as a master programmer and Patton Oswalt as the company's CEO, are woefully one dimensional. It certainly feels as if this movie wouldn't have been made if it weren't for the star power involved; but here, rather than talented actors raising up a bad script, they merely sink with it.

Emma plays a new employee at the world's biggest social media/search engine company called, 'The Circle'. Tom and Patton run the tech company that is sort of like if Facebook and Google had a baby and they named it Apple. They have developed miniature cameras that are being tested in a new program called 'Transparent', which refers to the wearer of said cameras as having no secrets-everything is broadcast over the internet for the entire world to see, except for bathroom breaks. Emma meets the other employees of The Circle, who all seem overly cheerful and friendly, except for John, who has some secrets and wants to share them with Emma. When Emma is 'Transparent', they show the comments from people that will pop up all around her, saying things like 'Good job!' or 'I'm proud of you!' or 'You are a terrible person!'. As can be expected, things do go wrong and secrets are revealed. Oh yeah, one notable mention is that this is the final movie of Bill Paxton, who plays Emma's father. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes. I did not enjoy the movie.

She's the proverbial horse-led-to-water, shown the dark side of the company's aspirations and then, against all sense of reason, doubling down on her support for the new evil empire. With a little nuance and a better understanding of metaphor, this could've served as a halfway decent Twilight Zone wannabe. Instead it's heavy-handed and preachy, forced and unfocused, with a blunt approach to morality that's more after-school special than Rod Sterling hypothetical. Flat, inept and simple-minded, it trips over its own feet in a feeble attempt to hit its misguided talking points. When it was all said and done, I felt like I'd been lectured by a loud, uninformed aunt on social media. I want to pat these filmmakers on the head and then back away",The Circle
34,alindsay-al,An awful film that is a total waste of potential,2,8 July 2017,"This films premise is pretty interesting and I saw the trailers that actually peaked my interest, but unfortunately this film is really poor. The premise of the film sees a young woman recruited to a company determined to achieve total transparency in the world. Emma Watson plays the lead actress in this film and unfortunately I found her really bland, her character is just given nothing to make you care about her and she just comes across with a very bland performance. Tom hanks is in this film as the head of the circle and he is fantastic in this film, he is easily the best part of this film with a funny charismatic performance that no matter what happens you can't help but like him. John boyega is in this film in a small role and he is really underutilized with nothing really to do in this film which is hugely disappointing. Also unfortunate that this poor film is bill Paxton's last ever film role before his death which is a sad fact about this film. The story of this film has a really interesting premise about privacy and when enough is enough, the films gives good arguments in both ways. However, especially towards the end of this film just skips its way through the plot that you are left questioning how and why things are happening. The script is just incredibly bland, the film never goes far enough with its dramatic dialogue to make you care about the characters or there situation. Also the humour just feels forced and in the end never made me laugh. The style of the film never goes the distance with how a situation like this film would actually happen in real life, also there is just some annoying stylistic choices that I wasn't a huge fan of. Overall I really didn't like this film but with a better script and performances this film could have been really good which is probably the worst thing about this film.",The Circle

36,arthur_tafero,Thought-Provoking Fiction - The Circle,7,22 May 2019,"This is one of the most difficul reviews for me to do; and I have done thousands of them. It is probably because I am on unsure philosophical footing about what the potential of mankind should be, as opposed to what it will likely become. For this reason alone; the ability to make one question one's values, the film deserves a rating of above average. The acting is pretty good. The entire cast does a good job, even though Emma's parents are a bit creepy. But then again, arent all our parents a bit creepy? And dont you think your kids will think you are a bit creepy when they get older? Not that we don't love our parents deeply and without reservation, but we certainly do not approve of everything our parents believe in or do. Nor do our parents believe or approve of everything we do. And our children will not approve or believe in everything we believe in or do. That is the way of the world from generation to generation.
The film examines a company that would be the combined social network of all social networks currently in existance. Facebook plus Twitter plus Google, plus Yahoo, plus We Chat, plus X,Y,Z....and so on. The leader of the Circle, Tom Hanks, is a combination of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and every other multinational leader you can think of, but without the consummate charm of Tom Hanks. How could such a person fail to convince millions?
But the deeper question here is not whether Tom Hanks and the Circle are good or bad, but whether we have any alternative scenario to this eventuality of singularity. Are we destined to be the Borg from Star Trek, but without all the uncomfortable hardware? Is total transparency possible and/or desirable? Emma practically drives her love interest crazy and to his premature death, yet she shrugs it off in a matter of days. Emma violates the privacy of her parents' innermost secrets without their consent, yet shrugs that off in a matter of days as well. It appears as if she has a very high opinon of her own existence in relation to the existence of others. Is she better than her love interest and her parents? Not likely. The film makes certain assumptions about equality and fairness that are highly unlikely and improbable. What are the chances that boomers, Xgens, Millenials and other age groups will have a consensus of what is acceptable in the social context? The chances are slim and none. The real question is actually whether or not a very few elite can totally dominate millions of the masses, and that answer is still up for grabs. The only difference between Tom Hanks and Hitler is that Hanks has much better tech to work with, and, of course, his much better personality. This is not a cult we are talking about, because cults tend to be small and secretive. This is something that is apparently transparent and on an enormous human scale. Nothing is more dangerous than something that is appealing to the masses that turns out not to be such a good idea. This kind of world would be appealing to extroverts, but horrifying for introverts. It would intrusive for those who like to keep secrets (wouldnt that be most of us?), yet appealing to those who have nothing to hide. Of late, the AI concern is about robots taking over the world from humans, but this film has a different scenario; it has humans in control of holistic technology. We might be better off with the robots in charge.",The Circle

39,kirbylee70-599-526179,Current of Future History?,6,28 July 2017,"The movie THE CIRCLE was released with little fanfare and not much push resulting in mediocre box office returns. With Emma Watson starring fresh off of her success in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST as well as her fan favorite status from the Harry Potter films and Tom Hanks, a major Hollywood star, one would wonder why that was the case. It was also based on a bestselling novel. So what happened? The movie stars Watson as Mae, a young woman struggling to get by. She works as at a phone center taking customer complaint calls, drives a beat up old car and helps in taking care of her parents Vinnie and Bonnie (Bill Paxton and Glenne Headly). Vinnie suffers from MS and Bonnie spends most of her time taking care of him. Mae's fortunes take a turn for the better when she receives a call from her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) telling her she got her an interview for The Circle.Mae arrives and passes her interview with flying colors and finds herself a new employee there. The Circle is a high tech company that has an involvement in every aspect of their employee's lives. Think Facebook or Google on steroids. Those who work there live on sight in housing created for them. Concerts, nightclubs, restaurants and more exist on the grounds of the company for them to enjoy.It goes beyond that as well as we and Mae soon learn. Her job is to handle complaints people have about the services the company offers. Each complaint is measured in how well she handles the call and in getting those complainants to take a survey rating her handling of the situation. Everyone strives for a 100% approval rating. Each person is also to have an online presence as well with an open page for all others to see and comment on. They are encouraged to post as much information there as possible.At a concert one night Mae meets a young man who is part of the Circle. They meet again later and for some reason he trusts her and takes her down to see something she isn't supposed to know about. Leaving behind all item provided to her (she wears a bracelet that monitors her physical well-being non-stop) he shows her a vast underground area that he tells her will one day house data collection equipment that will monitor everyone, something he didn't design the system for. He turns out to be Ty (John Boyega), the designer of the program that started The Circle.Mae catches the eye of company figurehead and leader Bailey (Tom Hanks). He eventually talks her into introducing the newest item The Circle plans to introduce, taking people into full disclosure and transparency. It's a small camera he shared during a speech with the employees earlier that can be found located around the world now and the new goal called SeeChange is to have people wear one 24/7 to share their lives. Mae is the first to do so.She benefits from this, firstly in confidence and popularity. Everyone knows her, everyone sends her comments. Her parents are put on insurance that covers her father's medical expenses. She is elevated in status in The Circle. But beneath it all something is just not quite right. Is The Circle the be all to end all or is there something more nefarious going on under the surface. Is this an altruistic company set on helping the world or is there an ulterior motive? And will a life changing event that happens with another new project help Mae to make the right decision of where to move forward? The movie works on a number of levels. Technically it is enjoyable to watch. The sights and sounds of The Circle are appealing and it would be easy to see why anyone would be seduced into working for such a company. They seem to care about your every whim, provide all that you need and help with matters in your life outside as well. Their goals seem to be to create a different and better world where politicians are held accountable and will use their products to prove that. But this tech savvy film also allows that there are almost always worms inside every ""apple"".In a world filled with selfies and automatic status updates on platforms like Facebook and Instagram it's easy to see where the question of just how much data is collected and used against us would make a great story. How many times have you logged into an account to find some suggestion of what you might enjoy reading or purchasing? That is the world of The Circle but much more intrusive. It should make for a good thriller but the problem I found was that so much time was spent promoting The Circle and setting things up that the thriller end of it doesn't happen until far too late in the film, almost the last 20 minutes.The acting by all involved is believable but nothing is outstanding. Hanks seems to glide through effortlessly here. His character seems to have just one emotion. Watson does well but her emotions run to two extremes, overjoyed and upset. She is better than this. Gillan offers the best display of acting here. Boyega is completely wasted in what I would consider a cameo role.While it's entertaining enough to spend the time watching in the end THE CIRCLE will most likely be a movie long forgotten in a short period of time. It should have been a movie that got people talking about the abuse of social media. Instead it offers some good questions that most will likely never consider having never seen the movie. On a sad note, this was the last film released for both Paxton and Headley. They deserved bigger and better roles.",The Circle
40,myriamlenys,"part satire, part science fiction",7,20 May 2018,"This is not the most moving or engrossing movie I ever saw, nor is it the most complex or subtle. For a movie about hypermodern social media it is, at times, strangely regressive : it takes the viewer back to the era of the silent movie melodrama, where villains twirl their mustaches, characters are either very good or very bad, and dastardly plans are hatched (and explained) clearly and slowly. While we're at it, ""The Circle"" could easily lose twenty or thirty minutes. I've never read the book, but there is something about the movie that screams ""Mediocre adaptation of far more interesting novel"".On the other hand : the performances are good and the cautionary message is both timely and welcome. The movie successfully points out that we, as human beings, are turning our world into an unlivable hell-hole similar to the dystopia foreseen by Asimov in ""The dead past"". It also points out, with equal success, that the men who want to know everything about our lives, are the ones who guard their own privacy, or their own right to privacy, the most fiercely. These guys may wear sandals and jeans and T-shirts saying ""Hi ! Just call me Luke !"", but in their own minds they're emperors of China, to be adored and obeyed by a grovelling court of concubines, eunuchs and slaves. Let the rest of humanity be watched and supervised ; the god-emperor takes a leisurely stroll on his very own Pacific island, far from prying eyes or pesky questions.So 7 stars, mainly for the validity and pertinence of the warning.",The Circle
41,JoeKarlosi,The Circle (2017) **1/2,6,7 May 2017,"In this updated reworking of ""1984"", young Mae Holland (Emma Watson from the Harry Potter series) scores a great job working for ""The Circle"", a social media type of corporation which functions more or less as a cross between Facebook and Apple. The company employees are all too eerily devoted to the workings of the job, which includes harboring all intimate information on each other, and placing tiny cameras practically everywhere in public in order to peer into all citizens' private lives. The two creators of this firm are played by Tom Hanks and Patton Oswalt. Their agenda dictates that privacy is equal to thievery, and that being under constant surveillance keeps people honest. They take Mae under their wing and she eventually works her way up the ladder - she even volunteers to let herself be ""transparent"", which means she wears a camera constantly (except for bathroom breaks) and allows her whole existence to be screened ""live"" all around the internet.That's enough of that. Emma Watson does a good job in her part and feigning her American accent, and since I don't follow Harry Potter I wasn't sure until afterwards if she had faked an English accent for that series, or if it was the other way around for this. However, since I AM a big fan of THE KING OF QUEENS TV sitcom, I had a rougher time buying the comedic geek Spence Olchin (ie; Patton Oswalt) in his serious role. Tom Hanks is a good actor and was really suitably despicable and frighteningly disingenuous. The problem was, there are good ideas here but not the best level of storytelling or plot flow. Some questions, too - such as the very last shot of the movie not making any sense, given the climax that had occurred shortly before it. At age 55 as of the viewing, the film's privacy invasion theme did at least make me leave the theater quite relieved that I'm as old as I am at this time, and maybe that I wouldn't mind being a little older, even. I grow more and more disgusted at the Facebook/social media/loss of security that abounds all around us these days.

42,s3276169,The film someone had to make.,7,23 August 2017,"The film someone had to make. It was inevitable with the current controversy surrounding technology and issues of information and privacy that someone would make a film on the subject.The Circle is a competent but by no means exceptional look at how technology controls information and impacts on personal and societal privacy.On the plus side this is an inherently watchable film. Emma Watson hands in a decent and very honest performance in the lead role. That said, the ""show stealer"" is Tom Hanks. Hanks shines as the co-CEO of The Circle. I used to work in IT and went to more than my share of tech events and Hanks is eerily familiar as the jokery but polished, put you at ease brand marketer, who makes seemingly not so exciting techie stuff, sound interesting and even exciting.The actual premise behind this film ""that everyone has a right to privacy"" but also informational transparency is presented in a very simple, accessible manner. It brings into sharp focus questions of where technology could and indeed is, taking us. Big technology corporations lobbying their governmental minions, who by degree chip away at our privacy. Always with the disclaimer that its to ""our benefit"". A point made and made again, in The Circle.On the downside this film is light on insight at times.

Everything in The Circle feels so manufactured and forced the whole way through, constantly hammering away at this whole sense of social media indulgence and how it impacts us. That concept isn't even new or interesting by the time this came out and the performances are never well deserved. It's just so frustrating having nonsense spoon-fed to us for nearly two hours all for just a super underwhelming ending that reminds me of the old Scooby Doos when the gang would rip the mask off the ghosts.The Circle is just a bad, preachy and super annoying experience only made worse by the absurd amount oof talent on screen that's still somehow inadequate when it comes to actually creating an engaging product.

It fact it would be a totally lame if it wasn't for how funny the mirror it turns on a thinly veiled tech billion-dollar corporation becomes. its this exaggeration of the ethos of a holier than holy tech company - and it's worker bees as well as mindless acolytes. If just a tenth of this is true for any corporation then I presume that company is in cahoots with the devil himself.The central themes are how much personal privacy is acceptable for a perceived societal greater good? Can world-wide for profit corporations have morality and ethics that supersede greed regarding it's employees, the public, and competitors? And, finally, can the government represent the populace instead of being corrupted by these powerful corporate entities? Pretty weighty stuff which, unfortunately, comes off plain silly more often than upsetting and compelling.I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this flick. The best thing about it is it's unintentionally funny with it's kernel of truth inside layers of overkill and exaggeration.. Tom Hanks can't even make much of a dent saving this one. I will give him credit for his character that seems like a mash-up equal parts Robert Schuller with Steven Jobs. This is slumming for Hanks and another waste of his time.

It's slow and without any real tension. Even its story is fairy benign. Nothing is too outrageous, the bad guys may not be bad. I recently saw The Titan and oddly, that was part of the problem there. Perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps understated (in this way) is a new way to present realistic drama (it's better than reality TV or hand held!). If you don't think Emma Watson is pretty then you're going to hate The Circle.

48,rgkarim,It's the Circle of Politically Dull!,6,29 April 2017,"Robbie K back, after being off the grid for a week. Tonight's review is on the latest ""dystopian"" feature film called The Circle. Former Hermione Granger, and more recently Belle, Emma Watson leads the film as she attempts to take us into the workings of a technological conglomerate who has knowledge as its key principle. Yet the trailers paint a much darker secret hidden in its stony walls, one that promises to be a real nail biter. Will this movie deliver those thrills, or are we stuck with another wash out? I'll do my best to answer that question, so sit back, and please read my latest thoughts. LIKES: Nice tool development  Emma Watson  Culturally Relevant Film  Solid Moral LessonSummary: We all know technology is becoming the heart of the world, if not already the heart of this country. And certainly, we all know that these technological marvels often require laborious development and maintenance to get the bugs out. The Circle portrays this very well, helping to develop the very tool that we all love. Throughout the journey, you'll get to see the development of the two-faced beast that is technology, and how it requires tweaking to get just ""right"". Not the highest selling point for a movie, but pretty cool. Of course, we all know many are going to go for the lovely Ms. Watson, to support the super actress they adore. Good news, Watson does a solid job holding up most of the movie, as she is primary the only main character of the film. Watson brings her charm to the screen once more, portraying intelligence, fortitude and inspiration in a manner that many will latch on to. Her accent is pretty sound (though it fluctuates at times), but she manages to deliver her lines with a decent balance of emotion, to sell her points most of the time. Yet the biggest strength of these movies is how culturally relevant it is to the audience. If you didn't gleam it from the trailers, The Circle is essentially a modernized version of the novel 1984 that once more addresses the issues of control, life sharing, and privacy. The film is certainly very political, but has a number of powerful lessons to teach about the place of technology and how easily it can be twisted. I myself liked the comments from Emma's followers, a fantastic representation of the shallow, superficial, and often selfish focus that the internet provides. The scenes are well developed to deliver the full emotional punch, which while not the most unique, can really shock you to the core at how true it can be. DISLIKES:  Cheesy acting at times  Other actors diluted  Missed character development  Ignorant/Idiotic moments  Lack of SuspenseSummary: Despite Watson's strong performance, she is involved in some overly cheesy moments. On many of the emotionally heated moments, she loses her balance and stretches into the overdramatic region, losing her accent and dialogue forte in the process. But even her worst acting doesn't hold a candle to some of the supporting characters who give either emotionally dull deliveries or lackluster performances. These moments are noticeable enough to offset the momentum of the movie, and derailing it from the quality the trailers promised. An even worse quality for me was how the other actors of the star-studded cast were reduced to simplistic roles. Legends like Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt and even the late Bill Paxton are reduced to very linear roles, with little character development or expansion beyond what you've seen in the trailer. With such a strong cast, I can't help but feel disappointed at the missed potential of this movie and how much this all-star cast could have done to amp up the quality of this movie. Even worse, some of the characters, primarily Emma Watson's character, become so blindly ignorant that the intelligence they worked so hard building is diluted to an idiotic level. As a result, I found myself starting to loathe the character and how 180 they took the character. Yes, I understand the premise behind the movie, but it didn't work for me. Other characters also fell into this mix as well, each built to have this incredible skill that was either not used or rapidly reversed to make the characters seem weak. Yet the most disappointing aspect of this movieis the lack of suspense. The trailer made this film out to be a mystery meeting dystopian policing. Not the case at all. The Circle has no mystery, laying all the facts on the table and leaving little to be uncovered. You would think there would be intense moments of espionage, or policing by superiors to build up excitement, right? Sorry, this film doesn't have that either, with the ""exciting climax"" not showing up until the last twenty minutes of the movie. As such, the movie is pretty dull and lacks the entertainment quality you might have been seeking. The VERDICT:The Circle is indeed a ""scary"" film, but it's mainly due to the reality check provides concerning the dangers technology can provide. This strong message is certainly the strongest aspect of the movie and Emma Watson was a fantastic choice to deliver it. Unfortunately, the weak characters, diluted roles, and lack of suspense took away from the entertainment quality of the movie. Such a dull delivery, leaves me recommending this one for renting at home, or at least recommending you read the book (or books) it is based on. My scores are:Drama/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",The Circle
49,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Circle,6,28 April 2017,"Tom Hanks is one of the world's biggest movie stars. When his name is attached to a project, it's an event. The box office numbers will be fairly ample and a certain amount of buzz will follow. In The Circle (my latest review), the buzz might have already came and went.Hanks takes on a supporting role in ""Circle"". That's right, a supporting role. He fades in and out of the film and you wonder why he actually agreed to be in it. Tom might have thought ""Circle's"" script looked like Oscar gold on paper. Or better yet, he might have been doing director James Ponsoldt a solemn service. Either way, his appearance although aberrant, is not a career killer for him. Tom's career is already assured.The Circle, with its overextended foothold on the aspects of social media, is fascinating. I mean, it would have been really fascinating had it come out over thirty years ago. Now, with its story being just intriguing enough, it also feels like it contains a little too much hooey for my taste. ""Circle"" although inferior, makes The Truman Show seem like Romper Room in comparison. Furthermore, it makes better, paranoid thrillers like Snowden appear more akin to a Sunday stroll. The Circle clocking in at just under two hours, is the ultimate invasion of privacy flick. I was reminded of Rockwell's ""Somebody's Watching Me"" with every bleeding second.Containing a sterile look, featuring annoyingly inept side characters, and harboring an unclear ending (the protagonist's motivations are either revenge or plain-old betterment), ""Circle"" chronicles one Mae Holland (played with straight faced discipline by Emma Watson). Mae looking to better her human potential, takes a job at an Internet corporation called The Circle. She quickly moves up the corporate ladder, becoming The Circle's forgone messiah. Holland eventually gets in over her head, blurring the company lines of surveillance, seclusion, and personal freedom. Tom Hanks plays Eamon Bailey, the head and co- founder of The Circle. In truth, Hanks and Watson give performances that rise above the otherwise, overly serious material. Also, the late Bill Paxton does decent work as Vinnie Holland, Mae's heavily disabled father. In conclusion, The Circle isn't an awful movie but it doesn't come close to being of Hanksian proportions. It paints a bleak rendering of the future complete with marble-sized cameras, plenty of flying drones, and visibly overused text messages. You'll be absorbed by its level of paranoia, its eye in the sky platitudes. At the same time, you'll be turned off by ""Circle's"" lack of warmth and secret society buffoonery. Call it a larger version of cinematic coterie. Call it EDtv for the satirically challenged. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",The Circle

Director James Ponsoldt's heavy-handedness in story has little subtlety and less risk. This is clearly aimed Social Media of today for delineating some boundaries with it, but the end result is a benign, unaffecting movie without any grit or buy-in.

Watson plays Mae, a millennial graduate who through luck and gumption comes to work for a Google/Facebook/Apple analog whose workplace culture would make any normal person worry about the Kool-Aid. After a laundry list of new-kid-on-the-block clichés, the story settles on Mae's emergence into the all-encompassing world of her job, which cajoles her to be a guinea pig in a new kind of social media.The Circle seems like it should be a pitch black satire on the dark side of Silicon Valley. Yet what it ends up being is a dull, incredulous parody of what people outside Silicon Valley think of people in Silicon Valley. No where is this more obvious than in the casting of Tom Hanks whose borrowed credibility feeds into the idea that cyberspace hides wolves in sheep's clothing. We want to trust his tech-billionaire Emon Bailey; even as he spouts the most outrageous, nonsensical phrases like he's complimenting a neighbors new car. Once we get to Ellar Coltrane's half-thought-out lectures on how things ought to be, the movie has gone so far up it's own a** that its brain is melting in stomach acid.What pains me is most of The Circle's various elements is it could have, should have, and needed to be way better. We have become a culture so dulled by the desire for convenience that most of us don't care internet companies buy and sell our personal information for the sake of better marketing and social conditioning. So long as I get my music to play on my Amazon Echo who cares if some murderer's most painful moment is immortalized on social media? Whether on purpose or on accident, Mae talks a big game about ""having a choice"" but rarely makes a choice without coercion. That could have been an interesting theme. Yet because The Circle is aiming to be A Face in the Crowd (1957) for the Youtube generation, no matter what choices she ends up making there's an immediate and negative consequence. Mae along with the audience is seemingly trapped in a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. A stolen kayak gives Emon the fuel to pursue his Orwellian fantasies, a boardroom brainstorm gets Mae to further abandon her authentic self in favor of a less-real social personality. Hell even her seemingly unrehearsed answers to interview questions get her the job, that sends her on a spiral of ruination in the first place! Thus when the ending rears it's ugly, insincere, vacuous head (apparently the ending of the book is different) we all automatically assume things aren't going to resolve themselves.In a world of nothing but accountability, is there really a need for integrity? This is a question I thought to myself while watching The Circle and sadly it's an idea that was never explored. Nor was there any followup on The Circle's apparent monopoly on practically everything on the interwebs (surely there are other virtual supervillains in Silicon Valley angling for world domination). Nope: boring characters, circular logic and techno-phobic platitudes are all you get here. All set to a soundtrack that sounds like the Blue Man Group underwater.",The Circle
52,bandw,"Worthy subject, weak script",4,7 September 2017,"This movie tries for too much. The idea of trying to analyze where high-tech may be taking us is a worthy subject, but the speculations provided did not engage me on a personal level, not did they provide any new insightsApple, Google, and Facebook are folded into one entity here: The Circle. The building that houses The Circle is a takeoff on Apple's home base and the campus life there is an amalgam of stereotypical scenes from a Google-like campus. Tom Hanks plays the president of The Circle as a conflation of Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos.The revolutionary product being developed by the The Circle is called SeeChange; it is a wide screen camera the size of an eyeball that can be trivially mounted anywhere and can broadcast its images to the web. The cultural effect of this product is to have tentacles reaching into all aspects of everyone's life. The pros and cons of a device such as SeeChange are discussed. The power this device vests in The Circle is frightening: it gives it the power to manipulate opinion by having voluminous data on any one person and then being able to aggregate those data. This would effectively give The Circle the results of instant polling with the ability to push out information to support or confront current trends. Maybe just an exaggeration of what already exists, yes?.Rather than speculation about an Orwellian future, I think it would have been more engaging to comment on where we are, even though where we are today may look simple minded in a year's time. Where I think the movie is on track is in trying to address the conflict between the power that corporations have and the erosion of privacy, but that's really not a novel idea at this time is it? A death by harassment is offered as a tragic result of The Circle's new product, so the moral seems to be that the dangers of where we are headed outweigh the benefits. I personally became aware of an unintended invasion of my privacy some years ago when I was having what I thought was a private conversation with a relative who in short order posted a summary of our conversation to his Facebook friends. I am not even on Facebook and I started getting e-mails about how people were offended by things I had said. This illustrated to me the power of social media to cause me to censor my speech even in a private conversation. No matter how you try to protect your privacy, technology reaches deeply into almost every aspect of your life. Think what would happen if the Internet were permanently disabled.Emma Watson plays Mae, an ordinary woman who gets sucked into the vortex of The Circle's power structure. I did not find Mae to be an interesting or engaging person. Her boyfriend Mercer had some appeal, but Emma dumped him early on. For this story to work we need to identify with Mae and her life. The reason ""1984"" was effective was because the two main characters are presented in a way to make you identify with their struggle at a gut level. In this movie I was not made to care much about Mae--her struggle was an abstraction.I give this movie marks for taking on an important subject but have to rate it poorly on providing much depth.",The Circle

If you believe a film like ""Snowden"", cameras have been likely to pop up out of our corn flakes for decades now.""The Circle"" is a serious version of ""The Internship"", but instead of Googliness we have Circlers, and instead of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughan we have Emma Watson.Emma plays Mae Holland who lands a job in the call centre (Customer Experience) at The Circle. She is inspired by the Steve Jobs-like CEO, Eamon Bailey, played by Tom Hanks. He exudes forward thinking and enthusiasm pacing up and down the stage in front of his company of bright young acolytes. The Circle has developed cutting-edge data-gathering technology and has just created a real-time, hi-def video camera the size of a marble that can be concealed anywhere.Mae is conflicted about the intrusion of The Circle into people's lives especially her own. However the story gets a little confused when she receives the opportunity to blue sky ideas, one of which involves being able to track down any person on the planet in the time it takes to make a cup of coffee. It's a concept that has Big Brother written all over it, but when she gets the job of implementing her ideas, she becomes a social networking guru.Eventually the whole thing becomes intrusive for her friends, her family and herself. In one scene, the only place she can find some privacy to talk to her friend away from the camera is in the loo - but you couldn't be too sure about that either.When tragedy strikes she has to rethink her approach to the privacy issue. I'm not sure the morality of the whole thing gets a satisfactory answer in ""The Circle"". At the end, Mae extols the virtues of the connectivity of everyone on the planet as she canoes solo on a sparkling lake with drones buzzing all around her.""The Circle"" really isn't very hard hitting.

54,leftbanker-1,Should Have Been a Short Fim,4,5 July 2017,"The book and this film both suffer from the same ailment: length.I would have really enjoyed this had it been reduced to a short story or at the most a novella but at 493 pages I found myself skipping over entire sections. One of my biggest complaints about books, films, and TV is that those creating content don't understand how long they need to tell their story. This would have worked for me as a short story. Instead it's a 493 page snorer. The film could have been wrapped up in about 40 minutes. Why does Netflix insist on stretching out shorts into features? It was rated 3.4 on Goodreads and 5.3 on IMDb so lots of people didn't think much of both projects. David Eggers had a decent idea and then buried it in pulp writing.The motivations of the protagonist just didn't make sense. Why would she hound her ex-boyfriend?

Several notable scenes (such as the one in which Mae's ex-boyfriend makes a run for it while being pursued by camera-toting people and drones) make the impression of being forced and artificial. The best moments in The Circle are the cerebral ones: Bailey's pep talks and the inner circle's brainstorming sessions. Mae's on-line odyssey – from obscurity to fame to desirous of a moment's solitude – might have been more interesting if it had been given time to develop. The Circle has a schizophrenic feel. In the end, it's not easy to decode what the precise bottom line is beyond the rather boring refrain of ""loss of freedom is what it is paid for greater connectivity.""",The Circle

Some say execution is bad but concept was good; I agree to some extent but even the concept was not even fully fleshed out. The motivation, growth, actions, etc. of the main characters make no sense.

Beyond that, it's a disappointingly rendered tale about the dangers of total social connection, or ""transparency"" as the script likes to put it. It raises far more questions than it's capable of answering with any authority (e.g. how did so many people fall into the Circle's tech-web so quickly, and without any significant resistance?), instead settling for a jumbled pastiche of philosophical points about ubiquitous surveillance and loss of privacy, none of which it explores to any genuinely human depth. It's an idea movie without any dramatic drive; its protagonist is little more than a hapless leaf on a windy day. Emma ""You have to ask again?"" Watson is a lovely young actor, and occasionally quite good, but she's thoroughly miscast here. Talents like Paxton, Headly, Tom ""Don't ask"" Hanks, and Patton ""C'mon!""

61,rockman182,The Circle (2017),6,2 May 2017,"I was a big fan of Dave Eggers' A Hologram for the King. It was a fantastic read for enjoyment and to analyze. The film adaptation also did not disappoint. When The Circle was announced as a film I immediately checked out the book. To my disappointment, the film wasn't as interesting an got to bogged down to its technological ventures and wasn't exactly the best read. However, I held out hope that the film would be able to impress, especially with the star studded cast at the helm.Emma Watson plays Mae Holland an ambitious young customer service rep who joins The Circle, a cutting edge technology based company that seems to be growing at fast pace and changing the future. The thing is, the technological leap of the company leads to massive privacy concerns and the company seems to be capable of more than what initially meets the eye. First off, I will say that the scathing reviews I've seen for the film are somewhat unwarranted, however the film is far from perfect and could have been much better.The plot may seem like its minimal or nonexistent but this wasn't really my concern. I was more concerned with things being introduced into the film that have no real importance later in the film. John Boyega's character is a glorified cameo that seems to just be there as a big name. In the book the character is mysterious has a much larger effect on Mae's life. The ending of the film leaves much more to be desired; there needed to be more explanation onto what the reveal was and anything about repercussions.The film is littered with talented people but unfortunately the writing and the structure of the film really lets them down. Its a misfire really, and the film needed to be much better and have a stronger central message. I feel like parts of the film and scenes were left on the cutting room floor.

Of course, we are willing to give up this privacy to make our lives more convenient. In The Circle (2017), the eponymous corporation is merely a stand-in for Google/Facebook/Amazon/Apple and is essentially a conglomeration of sorts of these tech companies. Of course, just like that antiquated operating system you've meant to update, The Circle contains a premise about five years too late. When the book this movie was based on came out, I'm sure it was thought-provoking; now it's more a matter of ""Yeah, yeah, we've heard this already.""Part of what strikes me about this film is that several segments of it probably worked better in the book. When I'm watching characters explain ""mandatory fun"" I can't help but cringe and wonder if it reads better than the performance I saw. Granted, there are segments which are better on the big screen, like The Truman Show (1998)-esque ""Transparency"" montage filled with the prolific and inane chatter of the internet surrounding the space around the main character. I'm also sure that plenty was cut to make the book film-length since some characters like Ty Lafitte (John Boyega) and Annie Allerton (Karen Gillan) were undeveloped at best.When it comes right down to it, the one element of this film that I felt was the most unbelievable was the naïveté of the characters, both main and collective. So many of the ""good ideas"" immediately raised red flags in my head regarding privacy and cybersecurity, let alone the mere legality of them. And yet, these characters marched blindly on, filled with idealism in their semi-utopian constructs that would lead to dystopia. Don't get me wrong, some of the ideas might have merit in our world, but the dance between the utopian and dystopian was a consequence of not thinking these concepts through to their logical conclusions.A cautionary tale for a fate that has already happened, I give The Circle 3.0 stars out of 5.",The Circle

65,bankofmarquis,Strong potential - unrealized,4,1 May 2017,"In the technologically advanced times we live in, there is the struggle between embracing the technology and being all-consumed by it.  That is the central conflict of THE CIRCLE - should we become more consumed/monitored/guided by technology or is it already too invasive in our lives, robbing us of our privacy, intimacy and  humanity.  An interesting premise for discussion and could have been an interesting premise for a film.But this film misses it's mark by trying to stand on both sides of this issue, never coming down on one side or the other ending up with a confusing mess that left me befuddled, bewildered and somewhat angry that I spent two hours in THE CIRCLE.Based on David Eggers novel of the same name, THE CIRCLE follows Emma Watson as she gets her dream job at tech giant THE CIRCLE (thinly veiled stand-in for Google or Apple) that is run by charismatic visionary Tom Hanks.  As she dives deeper into the THE CIRCLE, she must decide if Hanks is truly a visionary or a danger to mankind.The trouble with this film starts with direction by James Ponsoldt (who also collaborated on the screenplay with Eggers).  The tone and direction of this film is uneven (at best).  Do we trust Hanks character?  Do we trust the Stepford Wive-esque employees of THE CIRCLE who have, clearly, ""drunk the Kool-aid"".  Is Watson's character's motives pure and innocent?We'll never know the answer to all these questions as Ponsoldt starts digging into some interesting characters and situations only to abandon them for something else, then coming back to them in jarring ways that make no sense and really needed to be filled in better.Take, for example, Karen Gillan as Annie, a high-placed member of THE CIRCLE (at one point stating that she is part of ""the 40"" which, I take it, means she is in the inner circle).  She recruits and mentors here friend (Watson) to THE CIRCLE being gung-ho about the company and what it stands for and as enthusiastic about her job as anyone.  We then abandon this character for about 1/2 hour and when she returns she is ""rode hard and put away wet"", all glamour and spark gone, clearly burned out.   We then abandon her for another 1/2 hour only to find out that she is back home in Scotland, having ""got out"" of THE CIRCLE.  All fine and good - except we never find out what caused her to burn out, how did this change her and how did she get out.The same changes go through Watson's character.  Her Mae goes from cautious to dubious to ""all-in"" at a moment's notice and I never really believed her throughout the film and when her character takes a 90 degree turn at the end of the film - for no apparent reason - the film lost me.There are a couple of saving graces in the cast.  Bill Paxton (in his last film role) and Glenne Headly are grounding agents as Watson' parents and Patton Oswalt is interesting to watch as Hanks righthand man, twirling his mustache as a good villain should at the edges of the action, only to have no real denouement and he just sort of peters out, not really answering the question as to whether he is good, bad or misguided.But the real let down for me was Hanks as THE CIRCLE'S leading light - Eion Bailey.  This is supposed to be a charismatic, yet ego-driven and flawed character a la Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Steve Jobs, but fails to do so.  Hanks is, quite frankly, miscast in this role and it feels like he is trying too hard to rely on his charisma with nothing underneath it.  And, like the rest of the film, his character's conclusion is sloppy, uneven and unsettling, never really answering the question - is he good/bad/dangerous?  He just sort of is.And that's all I can say about this film, it just ""is"".  It should have been more.Letter Grade:  C4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Circle

That pretty much sums up director James Ponsoldt's The Circle with a screenplay by Ponsoldt and Dave Eggers, based on Eggers' 2013 novel of the same name and which stars Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. I read somewhere recently that despite his fine reputation as a novelist, Eggers is incapable of writing a good screenplay to save himself and so it seems here. This is one of those films that although having a strong production team behind it and a stellar cast, is completely let down by a seemingly haphazard storyline that is all over the shop.Consider the following frustrating inconsistencies/plot holes in The Circle.There is no backgrounding to Mercer & Mae's relationship, so his appeals to consider their past together, just appear rather silly.The same can be said about ""besties"" Annie and May. They don't really appear to have any chemistry together. Annie disappears for a long period of the second act, reappearing to suddenly hate working at The Circle and then leaving to return to Scotland with little explanation.Does John Boyega's character, Ty Lafitte, actually have anything to do with the main storyline? We are never privy to really why he chose ""the guppy"" with whom to start sharing his ""secrets"". Whatever, anyway he keeps disappearing back to the shadowy corners of the story and Mae seemingly does the opposite of that which he may have been warning. It seems to me he was entirely a redundant character, which is a waste of a fine actor.In a similar vein and I say this respectfully, not wanting to speak ill of the dead, but what's with the continual cutaways to Mae's parents? Mae goes back and has lunch/dinner with them every now and then, but so what? Was she supporting them? Was The Circle? There was something said about it providing some medical assistance, but that was it. Did it, didn't it work? Mae has lunch with them, then goes kayaking on the bay and cries. Why? Again, the thread was never really followed up.And God forbid, I hope the iconic Bill Paxton is not remembered for his comical performance as a dad stricken with MS. And was Glenne Headly really supposed to resemble an escapee from The Beverly Hillbillies and if so, why?Speaking of kayaking, how poorly lit was that nocturnal scene on the bay? Apart from knowing Mae was near water, I didn't know what had occurred until the events were being discussed in the next scene.A support character has a fatal motor vehicle accident after being harassed by some deviates using a revolutionary new Circle app and there are seemingly no legal ramifications for The Circle. Just carry on to ...... the big reveal at the end ... which revealed exactly what? Cue Mae going for another kayak surrounded by helpful drones ... The End!

68,dave-mcclain,"""The Circle"" raises important privacy issues, but does it through a non-sensical story.",2,30 April 2017,"Movies about technology run amuck have been around since before movies talked. Working backwards, we might mention ""Ex Machina"" and ""Transcendence"" (both from 2014), ""Transformers"" and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (both 2007), ""I Robot"" (2004), ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""Gattaca"" (1997), ""The Net"" (1995), ""Maximum Overdrive"" (1986), ""The Terminator"" (1984), ""War Games"" (1983), ""Demon Seed"" (1977), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) and even back to one of the last films of the silent era, ""Metropolis"" (1927). That short but representative list is a mixture of the classic, the underseen, the forgettable and the just plain bad. Then there's 2017's ""The Circle"" (PG-13, 1:50), which is based on Dave Eggers' 2013 novel of the same name and uses one young career woman's work and life experiences to imagine where continuing rapid advances in technology and on social media platforms (and the corresponding decline in personal privacy and security) might take us as a society. Mae Holland (Emma Watson) is a young woman stuck in a dead-end job, until a college friend named Annie (Karen Gillan) gets her an interview with the world's premier technology company. The Circle has the popularity of Facebook and the innovative spirit of Apple – and Mae is thrilled to be working there at first. Mae starts out (as many Circle employees do) in CE (Customer Experience – what the company calls their customer service department). As she works hard to get the average satisfaction rate for the customers she talks to on the phone as high as possible, she becomes overwhelmed by the corporate culture at the Circle. Not only do the (mostly youthful) employees enjoy the creature comforts and enjoyable diversions that have become a major feature of the modern workplace (especially in the tech sector), but she soon learns that the social aspects of working at the Circle are virtually all-consuming.The Circle basically runs the lives of all of its employees – and knows everything about their lives. Mae is expected to update her personal social media accounts regularly and with all sorts of fun and social activities. While working, she's expected to constantly correspond with all of her fellow employees through her computer, spend her leisure time with them and attend every party and social activity held on the Circle campus, where Mae lives in a type of dormitory. Company social representatives tell her that it's all ""strictly voluntary"" and ""just for fun"", but neither of those claims seems very honest. The Circle is a creepy combination of a summer camp and a religious cult. Putting it in pop culture terms, this place feels like a cross between Tom Cruise's office in ""The Firm"" and The Eagles' ""Hotel California"".At the Circle's weekly ""Dream Friday"" gathering of all employees, company co-founder Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) holds a kind of pep rally in which he talks about the corporate culture and plans for the future, brings guest speakers to the stage and unveils new products, a la Steve Jobs. When Bailey shows off The Circle's marble-sized ""See Change"" cameras, which can be placed anywhere and transmit anything to everyone, he sells it as a way to motivate average people to behave better and hold people in power accountable. At first, Mae expresses concerns about the privacy implications, but when one of the cameras results in her being rescued from a dangerous situation, she becomes the company's poster child for universal transparency. She agrees to be the first person to ""go transparent"" and wear a See Change camera 24/7, with viewers around the world commenting in real time on her every action and activity. Meanwhile, her drinking of the Kool-Aid brings her into the inner circle with Bailey and company co-founder, Tom Stenton (Patton Oswalt), but raises serious concerns from Annie, Mae's old friend, Mercer (Ellar Coltrane), Mae's parents (Glenn Headley and, in his final film role, the late Bill Paxton), and a mysterious Circle employee (John Boyega), and has serious implications for her life. ""The Circle"" raises important privacy issues, but does it through a non-sensical story. Examining the trade-off between the rise of technology and the decline of privacy is important, but doing so effectively requires characters who act like real people. The screenwriters, Eggers (adapting his book) and James Ponsoldt (who also directs), give us a cast of characters who not only drink the Kool-Aid, but who all have a hand in making the Kool-Aid and then serving it to others. If there were this many such people in one place in the real world, we'd call it an insane asylum. None of the characters even seem to understand or care about the obvious troubling and untenable implications of the Circle in their own lives. Other than one Circle insider, Mae comes closest to expressing concern about where all this is going, but she waffles repeatedly and sometimes does things that contradict her own self-interest. But don't count on the talented and accomplished cast to save this film. All of the main actors come across just as clueless and self-contradictory as their characters. Round and round they go, where the valid points in this movie are to be found, no one knows. This film deserves points for dealing with questions of privacy and accountability in our rapidly changing, increasingly open modern society, but then loses most of those points for its ridiculous script and disappointing performances.

70,jrarichards,"Mostly weak effort, if with tantalising moments of insight",7,31 May 2017,"James Ponsoldt's seemingly young adult-targeted ""The Circle"" tells us quite a lot about film-making towards the end of the 21st century's second decade. If one first asks whether some issues raised by this film will haunt the cinemagoer even after he/she has returned home, the answer would have to be a qualified ""yes"". But in answer to a question on whether that memorability had much to do with acting, cinematography or plot-development, a resounding ""no"" would most likely be needed! Once upon a time, films were less like that, and now many of them are just exactly like that...Tom Hanks is in there, pretty good as ever, but largely in a cameo role. As Eamon Bailey, he's the charismatic-ish head of one of those high-tech California companies that everybody - and especially every young person - dreams about working for.We all know the kind I'm talking about...One such new employee (or ""guppy"" as Bailey calls them) is Mae Holland, and in the ""anything goes"" and ""all ideas welcome"" atmosphere of Bailey's campus (known as ""The Circle""), Holland dreams of a meteoric career progression that she does in fact achieve here, though she has to pay a pretty high price to do so. This is a price that her colleague Annie and another guy she meets called Ty have already paid, and it's pretty much broken the both of them. Here were international opportunities for British thespians Karen Gillan and John Boyega, but ones that sadly don't seem to push their careers very far forward at all.It may be clear from even this hinted summary that there are some at times HEAVILY clichéd plot-lines in there, and much of what goes on here is as subtle as a brick. Furthermore, there are also moments of illogic and evident disjointedness. In this regard, Mae's parents seem like a particularly weird and hard-to-swallow pair that stretch credibility close to breaking-point! Given these sad truths about the film, a great deal hinges on the Mae Holland part, which is yet another in a series of starring roles handed over to Emma Watson. And here to the next perplexing aspect of ""The Circle"". Emma is a very special case, as she virtually grew up with us out here in audience-land, and there's no question that (for that and other reasons) she HAS a measure of screen presence. This is clearly what makers are buying into as they offer her star parts. In a shallower /trivialising sense, the questions revolve not least around the pleasant dilemma for cinema-goers of whether Emma is an astoundingly good-looking young woman, or actually ""nothing special"". There is seeming justification for both claims, the jury is out, but there is something a bit mesmerising about this mystery, as about the star herself. Altogether more doubtful is Watson's real ability to hold together a film of this kind, or indeed any other kind, with acting pure and simple. A further blow for British Emma fans (or, let's say, well-wishers) is that here she ditches the British accent, thereby delivering the coup-de-grace on suspending disbelief among at least part of her audience.All in all, let's suggest that the lead actress does just about well enough, and in this sense we come to the small glimmer of positivity that may be attached to ""The Circle"". There are a select few lines delivered by Watson and Hanks that do indeed hit home. These are ones in which the language of democracy, civil society and human rights is pressed into the service of what is actually a monstrous riding roughshod over those very virtues, and those of Constitution, nation-state, the division of powers and almost every other tenet of civilisation so many of us still vaguely hold dear. At these precious times, ""The Circle"" does indeed grab our attention persuasively, ensuring that this piece will not quite suffer relegation into total forgettability, and sink without trace.For the sake of those who may wish to indulge for the above reasons, I will deliberately hold back on exactly what goes on in the film, but what I can do is remind one and all of the potential (indeed not entirely unforeseeable) perversion of traditional principles of representation, governance, public administration, the division of powers, the legislative role of parliaments and so many other tenets that is possible if we accept for even a short time the dodgy premise that: if we find a way of bringing virtually all citizens in a country into lively and regular contact with one another (albeit with mediation and facilitation in the hands of a huge profit-making corporation with its own agenda) then we bypass the need for government and administration and achieve true democracy, right? If we do the same with ordinary people between countries, we can also do away with nation-states and diplomacy, right? And if we make virtually everyone's behaviour accessible constantly online, then through endless and totally far-reaching peer review, we put an end to all crime and all abuses of human rights, right? And into the bargain, we get to protect most people from the stupid things they might get up to most of the time, right? If anyone feels these claims are indeed ""right"" (in at least two senses of that word), well, ""The Circle"" could indeed be a worthwhile watch, in spite of itself; and all the more so given an ambiguous ending that suggests the above process of pseudo-grassroots pseudo-governance through online connectivity is really a one-way street that, once embarked upon, might prove surprisingly hard to undo or step back from.I wanted 6, but thought 6.5 fits the bill better and so rounded up to 7. In fact, ""The Circle"" is not really good enough for 7, but there you have it...",The Circle
71,bob-the-movie-man,Social Media involvement in political manipulation? Don't be ridiculous!,7,5 November 2017,"Set in the near future ""The Circle"" tells a horror story of the social media age involving an omnipotent American corporate, pitched somewhere between being Facebook-like and Google-like (note, lawyers, I just said ""like""!) Emma Watson (""Beauty and the Beast"") plays young intern Mae who, partly through the aid of family friend Annie (Karen Gillan, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Doctor Who"") but mostly through her own aptitude, lands a foothold job in customer services for the company. With the lush corporate campus fast becoming home, Mae is quickly singled out as having ""executive potential"" by the charismatic CEO Bailey (Tom Hanks, ""Bridge of Spies"") and his more taciturn sidekick Stenton (US comedian Patton Oswalt). Progressively brainwashed into believing the company's intrusive snooping (a favourite motto is ""Secrets are Lies"") is all for 'the greater good', Mae champions the cause until a tragedy rocks her world and her company beliefs to the core.Whenever I watch a film I tend to form my own opinion first before checking out what the 'general public' on IMDb think. In this case, I must confess to being a bit surprised at our divergence of views: a lot of people clearly hated this movie whereas I confess that I found it very entertaining. Certainly with the alleged role of Russia in influencing elections around the world via social media, the film is most certainly topical! Many reviewers seemed quite upset that Watson's character is such a 'doormat', in that her views are so easily manipulated by the corporate machine. But not every woman – as indeed every man – can or should be a Joan of Arc style role model in every film: why should they be? I actually found her indoctrination into ""the Circle way"" as quite convincing, especially a creepy scene where two corporate lackies (Cho Smith and Amir Talai) say that they're not checking up on Mae's social life, but. Watson enjoys extending her post-Potter repertoire well, but the talented John Boyega (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") is completely wasted in his role as Ty; the Wozniak-like genius behind The Circle's technology. The script gives him very little to do other than stand around and look grumpy.The film is sad in being the last movie appearance of the great Bill Paxton (""Apollo 13"") who plays Mae's sick father and who died of complications following heart surgery two months before the film's release (the film is dedicated ""For Bill""). Tragically, Mae's mother in the film, actress Glenn Headly (""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"") also died suddenly at the age of 62, also due to heart problems, a couple of months after the film's release. It's surprising the film doesn't have a ""curse of The Circle"" tag on it.The film was directed by James Ponsoldt, who also wrote the screenplay with novel-writer Dave Eggers (""Away We Go""). I particularly liked the on-screen use of captioning (posts) which was reminiscent to me of last year's ""Nerve"", a B-movie film I rated highly that also had a string social media theme.While the ending of the film is a bit twee – a movie definition of ""being hoisted by your own petard"" – it's overall a thought provoking piece sufficiently close to the truth as to where society is going to raise the hairs on your neck.(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

73,Carycomic,"I saw it this past week end. Good cast! But, dubious message",5,1 May 2017,"First off, there's Tom Hanks as Eamon Bailey. No surprise that he's co-starring, since co-producer ""Playtone"" is the production company he founded and named for the fictional record company in ""That Thing You Do!""Then, there's Emma Watson as Mae. In this film, Mae is the polar opposite of Hermione Granger. By that I mean, where Hermione was initially a stand-offish know-it-all in the ""Harry Potter"" films, Mae is initially a fun-loving outdoors woman who always makes time for her family and friends. But, after she learns about her ""lack"" of social networking one week after joining the Circle, she basically becomes a virtual daughter. Only talking to her parents (including the late, great Bill Paxton in his final film role as Mae's terminally ill father) via webcam!Then, things start to get really scary. For starters, she suggests a way to make voting, by computer, mandatory. With the voters being registered solely with the Circle. Then, she comes up with this thing called 'total transparency.' The theory being that if _nobody_ has anything to hide, illicit activities (especially by those in power) will go the way of the dinosaur.That's where the slippery slope begins for me. I mean, what if the non-voters have absolutely _zero_ confidence in _any_ politician running for office. No matter _how_ much they know about that politician! Isn't it a bigger waste of one's right to vote to cast it for someone you have no faith in at all (Republican, Democrat, or third party)? I say: yes!I realize that Mae has only the best intentions. But, we all know which road they say uses good intentions for pavement! Because I firmly believe that _everybody_ is entitled to a private life outside the bedroom and bathroom. Yeah, sure! The press is always screaming about the public's right to know. But, the real question is: do we, the public, really _want_ to know?And, as a member of the public, I reply: no! I don't need or want to have even my parents share 100% of everything with me! And I insist on the reverse being equally true. Like it or not, we _all_ keep at least 1% of our private lives private from each other, no matter how close the biological and/or emotional relationship. And that's as it should be.",The Circle

The film The Circle is a perfect example. There was a lot of potential for a very interesting investigation of companies such as Google (which appears to be The Circle in disguise), but a satisfying critique is not completed. instead, the viewer is left wondering at the end what should be happening in the last (missing) thirty minutes of the film.

76,msbreviews,Rating: D,3,9 August 2017,"You know, if a movie lets me down because of its plot, direction or characters, it's fine, I never get mad or angry at it. However, when a film has all of that and it still tries to trick me and every fan to go to the cinema by using a famous movie star (like, for example, Tom Hanks or John Boyega) on the main poster and trailers, for to only show them in four or five scenes ... Now that gets me frustrated!The Circle is not only a very bad film but also had a marketing campaign extremely dishonest. I really feel bad for the cast because it has some brilliant actors in it. Tom Hanks is a legend, even if he only appears in a few scenes, he's incredibly charismatic and elevates his character. John Boyega (Kalden) is also great for a couple of moments that he's on the screen, but his character has nothing going for him. Emma Watson, well ... She's good. She's not brilliant nor perfect like she was in Beauty and the Beast, but she doesn't have a defining scene, a moment where she's truly able to shine.Both Mae and the story have a similar route throughout the runtime. Both of them have a very interesting concept/premise, but their execution is horrible. Mae seems to be a regular girl, but the changes that her personality goes through are too extreme for me to buy them. The movie's plot follows that same path by having a really intriguing story that is taken to so unrealistic and implausible levels, that by the end, it can only be described as too dumb and stupid to be true.The first act runs smoothly and it actually introduces its characters well, but the second and third act drop to a sleepy slow- burn, full of speeches in front of an annoying audience and with both plot and character development that doesn't make any sense. The ending has no resolution at all. There's barely a conflict throughout the film! They all agree with everything and when something goes wrong, they just go ""well, it's fine, let's move on"".It's a very monotone movie since there's nothing happening, ever. I can only remember of ONE moment of stress or tension, whatever you want to call it. The rest of the film is just hearing people talking about some absurd stuff and watching them go absolutely crazy. It's filled with heavy exposition scenes, it's horribly edited (there's a bathroom scene that becomes cringe-worthy) and the script is just horrible.I don't even want to write anymore ... Not that I have that much more to say. Apparently, we can have BILLIONS of people connected at the same time watching a live stream ... BILLIONS. Yap ...The Circle is one of the worst movies of the year and on top of that, it tried to lie to its audience by bringing in Tom Hanks to serve as poster and trailer's bait, even though he's just on the screen for barely a few scenes. The cast and the film's concept are the only reasons why it doesn't get an F rating. The plot's execution (script, editing and direction) is horrible. It's sleepy boring, it's incredibly monotone and its characters have nothing going for them. The ending is as dumb as the rest of the film: too stupid to be true.",The Circle

In fact, there's a live-stream scene in the movie that ends tragically ala the Christchurch shooting that was livestreamed on FB. The movie had a decent start/setup but then rushed at the end to make all its points. Because of that, it would've played better as a short 8-ep streaming series; instead, it sacrificed plausibility in order to complete its story within the short time allotted.

79,CANpatbuck3664,The Circle Fails to Connect Because of Idiot Characters and a Tired Message,4,30 April 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Mae Holland (Emma Watson) is a lowly temp working at a customer service line for a local water company. She's not necessarily happy with her line of work but it allows her time to see her mom Bonnie (Glenne Headly) and her dad Vinnie (Bill Paxton) who is unfortunately suffering from MS. She also bumps into her friend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) every once in a while and they trade arguments about the role of technology in modern day social interaction. She gets a call one day from her best friend Annie (Karen Gillan) who works at the popular tech company The Circle. They have an opening in their customer service department and she's been able to set Mae up with an interview. Annie's part of the inner sanctum at the company, she's not at the very top level but she's on the level or two beneath it. Mae is overjoyed and as luck would have it, she aces the interview. She's hired on the spot and is asked to show up for work at The Circle the next day.I'm going to warn you now, I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this movie. I'm with the majority of reviewers in saying that this movie is sub-par and retreads familiar territory that we didn't need another movie about. But I do have one positive aspect to defend The Circle with. When you look at technology companies that are on the cutting edge (e.g. Google, Facebook and Apple) their employees and customers seem to border on the fanatical. There's a sort of blind loyalty that can't be reasoned with in some cases. The Circle really taps into that and presents this in a scary yet honest light. Sure, the movie plays it up a little past believable but they really push The Circle being almost like a cult. Bailey (Tom Hanks), the CEO of The Circle, uses this to his advantage and after he pairs that with his own charisma, he wields it as a weapon against whatever he wants (in this case, laws about privacy or legislators). So I'll give the movie some partial points for being relatively realistic that way.This movie boasts some pretty impressive talent with up-and-coming stars Emma Watson and John Boyega. Add in A-lister Tom Hanks and you think this would be a can't miss project based solely on the performances. Even the big stars in the cast don't help this movie. I normally like Emma Watson but I didn't like her in this at all. Her accent kept slipping and she couldn't sell her character's naivety. It's on her to carry this movie and she can't do it. I wish Tom Hanks had decided to try out being a villain in a better movie. He's got a lot of gravitas and he's a good mix of inviting enough to trust yet menacing enough to be worried about. It's too bad it's obvious after the first 20 minutes that The Circle is up to no good. John Boyega is solid but the movie gives him very little to do except drop exposition on the audience. I liked Karen Gillan but her character turns on a dime. Patton Oswalt is there just as a background character and a yes man for Hanks. One of the best performances came from Bill Paxton (in his last movie role) but he's in the movie so little.There are 2 big reasons that this movie doesn't work. The first is that this movie is as subtle as someone operating with a sledgehammer. We need The Circle's goals to appear to at least be mixed at first. The audience needs to be intoxicated by their fancy gadgets and their potential to help the world. Yet soon after Mae starts her job, it becomes obvious that The Circle is reaching out way too far. Seriously, the logic they use to justify their actions is a joke. This leads to a question: Why isn't there any serious resistance from the public when The Circle's actions grow more and more aggressive? They briefly bring up how the company possibly blackmailed a senator but then there isn't any mention of it after. The subject of technology and social media being scary has been done over and over again. This movie needed to bring something new to the table, yet it trips over every issue that this kind of techno thriller can't ever hurdle.The other problem is that Mae is so easily manipulated by Bailey and The Circle. I stopped rooting for her about halfway through the movie. She becomes a puppet for The Circle's agenda and her lack of reasoning was infuriating. She not only falls for this crap but she furthers it because she's such a dunce. It just made the movie seem even more divorced from reality. I'm not saying that social media is evil but in this movie there is no such thing as a middle ground. Mae isn't that interesting of a character to begin with and with her becoming a mouth piece for Bailey and The Circle, I lost all sympathy for her outside of her well-meaning parents.I like to weigh the pros and cons but outside of some okay cinematography, a mix of relatively decent acting to lacklustre acting and a couple of miscellaneous story points, this movie fails on almost every level. It isn't realistic at all, it's full of nonsensical characters or characters who aren't interesting. It also talks down to you with a worn out message that we've heard a million times. The message has worth but they can't do anything new with it. This is a tough movie to make and they had assembled some decent talent but they still failed. Unless you're a big fan of the book, you should skip this.",The Circle
80,Laakbaar,The limits of transparency,7,30 May 2017,"This movie is an exploration of our modern online ""black mirror"" culture, this time focusing on large corporations (think Google, Apple and Facebook) that are forcing us to publicly live our lives online.It's a slick, snazzy movie with good production values, a good script and decent acting. Emma Watson's skills and amiability are on full display here.At The Circle, ""transparency"" is pushed as a public good, even though it really serves corporate purposes. We see in this film how far it can go.This movie is like ""Nerve"". ""Nerve"" looked at online anonymity, sensation-seeking and desensitisation; this movie looks at the slippery slope between ""transparency"" and totalitarianism.The Circle is ultimately a creepy place where the employees are forced to live their lives online in a way that comes across eventually as malevolent and overly intrusive.Our heroine is apparently one of the few who are not using the internet for romantic or sexual purposes. She seems to have no tension between her online (non-existent?) sex life and her online public life. No wonder Tom Hanks loves her.Of course, the rest of us do have that problem. There is a good deal of tension between our online sex lives (which we want to keep private) and our online public lives (which we are willing to share). If the good people at The Circle are going to make everything completely transparent with the assistance of millions of cheap mini-cameras, it's going to have to deal with the fact that 90% of the internet is being used to get off.This is the creepy horror of the internet for many of us: Facebook and Google are going to blithely reveal our dick/boob pics, our sexts, our sex vids, our porn preferences, our kinks and our f*ck dates to our families and employers.This movie presents that issue in a single but hugely important scene. The line is briefly crossed. But it is not her sex life that ends up being made public. It is her parents. OMG, America is horrified. People are having sex!! What's hypocritical about this scene is that it avoids the main issue, and deflects it into an issue about respecting your parents' privacy.This online tension between anonymity and transparency is a huge topic. But this movie does not do it justice, in my view.And of course there is also the problem -- which the movie deals with in detail -- that some people simply don't want to be online all the time. Some of us don't want their lives to be transparent. What do we do with them? I think this movie addresses a huge anxiety of the selfie generation. They need anonymity; but they are also afraid of not being watched. It's admittedly a very strange situation. How did our society end up like this?I think this movie is worth 7.5, but I'm going to round it down because I don't like how it dealt with sex.",The Circle

84,ethanbresnett,An interesting premise which fails to get up to full speed,7,13 June 2020,"The Circle tackles the hot topics of big data, surveillance, privacy and the ways that corporations look to use, abuse and accumulate all of the above. All topics that are highly relevant in our times, and if nothing else this film gives one pause for thought. What struck me most about The Circle however is that it isn't satisfying. You expect films like this to have a big comeuppance moment, which this film really didn't have in my opinion.I'm being more critical of this film than perhaps I should mostly because I think the underlying concept is so fascinating and relevant, but this potential wasn't capitalised on. There were a few threads introduced in the film, such as Mae's relationship with Annie, which didn't really have a pay off or purpose, and others which had unsatisfying ends. I won't delve into the plot too much so as not to spoil, however I found it teetering constantly on the edge of being more interesting than it was and never actually getting there.The character of Mae was a tricky one. I could never quite figure out her philosophy or attitude and found it hard to follow her journey throughout the film on an emotional level and get to grips with her reasoning. I think this film was too superficial in this respect, ironic really considering its subject matter. John Boyega's character was criminally underused. A great actor but not used at all to his full potential. The character just wasn't developed at all and yet was quite instrumental to the story in the end. It seemed like it could have been an interesting plot point but wasn't explored.None of this particularly detracted from the performances, which were solid I thought. Tom Hanks played the CEO of a hipstery tech company extremely well - the corporate man who tries so hard not to be corporate. Emma Watson was good, although I've seen her give much better performances. I mentioned earlier the lack of emotional connection and understanding with her character, but I don't think this was down to her performance, rather the plot and script. Also Karen Gillen was a lovely treat! A great actress who I'd happily watch in anything.I did enjoy the direction of this film, with the way that the digital world was presented on screen and how it was portrayed.Overall The Circle wasn't bad, but was disappointing nonetheless. It was a film with a lot of potential in its underlying themes and premise, but failed to deliver an interesting narrative around this.",The Circle

The so-called sci-fi thriller The Circle (2017) is one such movie. Perhaps any film that satirises the seductions and power of techno giants like Google, Apple and Facebook is treading on sacred ground. While it's not a masterpiece, the film does its job in airing some chilling issues about political and corporate accountability in the ever- expanding digital domain.Stuck in a dead-end job, Mae Holland (Emma Watson) gets the chance of a lifetime to work with the world's biggest intelligence surveillance company called The Circle. It's a dream workplace with thousands of employees and every conceivable benefit, but it also expects 24/7 commitment and social involvement.

It turns out that she is a natural at selling Eamon's ideas for increasing employee surveillance and she even volunteers to wear a constant monitoring camera. She becomes the company's high-profile propagandist for transparency and the dispensability of personal privacy. The company introduces automatic voter registration for employees and its own preferred congressional candidate. It wants to extend Circle accounts to the entire population and link everyone to the electoral process. Unexpected things happen when the transparency lens is turned inward on the company.So why is this film being thoroughly trashed? Emma Watson is difficult to watch without seeing her Hermione halo, but she is perfect for a role that calls for naïve understatement. Tom Hanks plays a likable baddie with his usual over-reliance on those adorably furrowed Scully eyebrows. But describing this film as a futuristic sci-fi thriller has raised expectations that are impossible to meet when its narrative suspense curve is mostly flat and its technology already available. Then there is that feeling where someone is lecturing you about the dangers of believing technological masterminds with a script that often sounds somewhere between melodrama and corny.There is one redeeming feature that makes this film undeserving of universal panning. It modernises the Orwellian 1984 techno-dystopia with a core premise that is not as absurd as some might think. The sheer scale of economic and political power of today's mega technology empires surpasses that of contemporary government and they have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to distort democracy everywhere it exists. If fake news can sway elections, what can real-time online manipulations of voting behaviour do? Audiences and critics do not like being mocked for their willingness to be herded like sheep into digital dependence. The warnings in this film hit home.",The Circle
87,skay_baltimore,The Circle Is Broken,4,6 December 2017,"This just isn't a very good movie. Why? Well, for one thing, it's way too preachy. But more importantly, Emma Watson just isn't a very good actress. She can't and doesn't carry this film. There are parts where I found myself laughing at her speeches when she was dead serious. That's never a good thing. She's like a child actress who bombed as an adult. She reminds me in many ways (not good ways) of SMG. Her face scrunches up in a mix of smiling and angst and it just doesn't work. She's way out of her element when she's not in a Harry Potter film. In conclusion, the reason this movie isn't very good is not because its message isn't important; it's that the delivery system is fatally flawed. I watched this movie for free. I feel as if I didn't get my money's worth.",The Circle

89,Mike_Devine,"For a 'Circle,' it's actually pretty square",4,15 April 2018,"As technology continues to become ingrained in our fabric, we've all had to decide what we value more - access or privacy. At the center of this decision are a number of corporate conglomerates - Google, Apple, Facebook - take your pick. It's uncertain how close to home 'The Circle' hits, and how similar the fictional Silicon Valley company depicted in the film is, but it's definitely a thought-provoking premise.As a film, however, 'The Circle' is more square. Despite the obvious star power of Emma Watson - who portrays a young, bright-eyed ""guppy"" at the organization and Tom Hanks - who plays his best idealistic-yet-devious executive set on securing as much control as possible - there are problems with the plot. Watson's Mae is a lower-class millennial trying to make ends meet while helping her family. She seemingly has a good head on her shoulders, but when she lands a job at The Circle, things start to change. Mae is written as such a wooden character, and while she was created in a way that should prompt audiences to really identify with her, it's difficult to do so. And this is sad, given the level of acting we know Watson is capable of.Everything is so dry, stale and boring. Billed as a futuristic thriller, 'The Circle' comes off as being very formulaic and unlike the innovative products that are at the center of the film. It kind of feels like what would happen if a board game came to life - 2D and fake. And sure, there is something to be said about the message at the heart of this film - assumably that we should think twice about using social media and technology, or at least acknowledge the concessions we are making to our privacy. But even this comes off as a throwaway talking point.This film is a hollow effort from director James Ponsoldt, and audiences should stay clear of entering this 'Circle.'",The Circle
90,Ramascreen,Kool-Aid drinkers!,4,27 April 2017,"THE CIRCLE wants to make you think that this movie is presenting something revolutionary or innovative, it wants to wow you into believing as if you're watching a profound film that bravely tackles the issue of privacy in the social media age by way of a Microsoft or an Apple company-esque scenario. But nothing could be further from the truth. Author Dave Eggers and filmmaker James Pondsoldt aren't really giving us anything new here, only a version of something too familiar.Emma Watson plays Mae who rises through the ranks of the world's largest tech and social media company, The Circle. Meanwhile Mae struggles to do right by her family and her old friends. But company founder Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) manages to convince Mae to go transparent, meaning everyone in the world will get to watch her 24/7 livestreaming. It does however come at a hefty price.You know those many stories you've heard a thousand times before about a utopia place where everything seems to be perfect and everyone seems to be happy. At first the protagonist buys whatever the place is selling, he or she even becomes somewhat of a spokesperson inviting others to join in but the process ultimately pushes their loved ones away. Then the protagonist discovers the truth which usually happens with the help of an inside man. After a certain tragedy occurs, it's then payback time. Really, that's all there is to THE CIRCLE. It's formulaic through and through.THE CIRCLE is predictable, it's boring and some of the characters are annoying. I'm a big fan of Patton Oswalt but I can't take him seriously as a chief operating officer of anything. Tom Hanks plays a villain for the first time since God knows when but he's not able to emulate that Steve Jobs charm, Hanks acts more like a snake oil salesman.The film's attempt to make Silicon Valley tech giants appear like immoral entities are laughable at best. I'm not saying those guys over there are saints, but THE CIRCLE's biggest problem is that it doesn't know how or it's not smart enough to dance in the gray areas, its main message essentially when you strip it down to the core is that too much of a good thing is bad.But the film does point out one thing correctly, how a keynote presentation often times can be no different than a church gathering in that they both feel like a cult. The priest or the presenter up front preaching his sermon or about the latest tech gadget, and then the converts cheer Hallelujah. It takes a non kool-aid drinker to view things objectively for what they are. I think that particular approach by this film is at least worth noting.-- Rama's Screen --",The Circle

93,kermitkid,Book adaptation is choppy,7,30 March 2020,"This is one of those movies where you need to read the book first. The reason for that is the book is about 500 pages and they needed to cut a lot out and as a result, the editing is a bit choppy, and the film may be confusing as it does move very quickly. But since I did read the book, that wasn't a problem. Some of the best performances of the year are in this film, particularly from Tom Hanks, Emma Watson, and John Boyega. However, one of the worst performances of the year is also in this film from Ellar Coltrane. His performance is just awful. Every line from him, without exception, is either without emotion, or just very awkwardly delivered. They really should have given him better direction or hired someone else. Most movies of this nature are very one-sided, but in this film both sides of the argument are delivered very well. You see the positives and negatives to both sides, although the negative sides from Tom Hanks' character's point of view are presented as very manipulitive but that's the point. I wouldn't say Tom Hanks' character is evil or a villain in the way we traditionally think of movie villains, but he's not afraid to deceive and manipulate, and sometimes play on human emotion to get what he wants. He presents this fascist society as a good thing for the betterment of humanity, and preys on common human empathies and sympathies to convince people to side with him. He's not the level of, say, President Snow from ""The Hunger Games"", but he's pretty close. Whereas Snow uses threats, Hanks' character takes a ""You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar"" approach, as do most of the other employees of The Circle. Like I said, you should probably read the book first, or you may get confused because of the choppy editing, but once you've read it, and then seen this you'll be able to piece together the missing elements of the film. Will this win any Oscars? Probably not. but it is still a very important film that everyone needs to see.

First thing where I started to scratch my head was when boss explained how they placed small cameras in diverse places, so in some dictatorship cities, and that can not be discovered. That's total ridiculous - even if there is no radio signal emission, there are detectors which will find such electronic devices easily. Unrealistic point #1 . And there was lot of it later. I will not go here in direction and editing, story telling flaws - you can read a lot about it in other reviews. What made me giving low rate of 5 is that movie deals with very serious social, political issues in very immature fashion. Whole accident with friend was so predictable, and weak in legal aspect. And worst part was the ending, unfortunately. Despite all bad things happened, our heroine was happy with transparent New World. But nothing about main problem in such World: who will control computers which deal with it ? What happened with 2 bosses of Circle, who, as is told couple times clearly broke law seriously ?

It's the critically reviled techno thriller which is played out as George Orwell flavored near future sci-fi, only everything in is already real. More or less. A girl (Emma Watson of Harry Potter"" movies) working at one of the world's largest tech / social media companies discovers that modern technology is only as cool as the people who own it. Turns out, free lunches are not that free after all. The Circle"" can be called an insightful look about perils of our digital life, or a paranoid thriller without suspense, urgency or a single new thing to say"", as Rolling Stone has delightfully put it. Many gravitate towards the latter. Me, I am more generous here. I'd call it a fully functional movie, just not a very gripping one. The main problem may be that if you know about the digital life and it's shadow side, The Circle"" only recapitulates the often heard bullet points and adds nothing new. And if you don't know or care, then nobody offers convincing arguments to invest yourself in it either. The result in its one-note-ness and unelegant-ness resembles some popular teen drama: you can watch it and don't have to feel bored exactly, but you'll never mistake it for really good stuff. In the age of quality TV series, The Circle"" can't help but feel anachronistic, although its topics are thoroughly modern. Emma Watson is a bit too charmless to carry the result alone but her more intriguing co-stars (Bill Paxton in his final movie role, Tom Hanks as the founder of the company, Patton Oswalt, Glenne Headley) are sadly delegated to sidelines and can't really help carry the weight. All in all, I gotta say, the reputation of The Circle"" is worse than the movie itself. Sure, it's not great, and would probably work better as an episode in anthology such as Black Mirror"". But there's nothing really wrong with it either. It's a serviceable thriller for educating youngsters and effective cautionary tale about modern digital life.",The Circle
96,WalkdenEntertainment,It's a Circle In Which The Audience Members Want No Involvement With...,2,10 January 2019,"Mia (Emma Watson) works for a water company. Her day includes chasing payments and making other daily corrections within her company. Thanks to her best friend Annie, Mia scores a job interview and lands a dream job at the powerful, high tech company called ""The Circle"". Mia soon learns there is more about this company that will effect the lives of all humanity.It's no secret that we ourselves live in a pretty cool world full of high gadgets and advancements. The Circle is a company that desires to aim higher and one of main company's directors is Bailey (played by Tom Hanks), who is passionate to make the world an even better and safer place though the use of advanced technology.While Mia doesn't have any real high end experience in the world of technology or programming, as the film progresses it's Mia who meets key characters who just happen to reveal more about the company or assist her with making massive creative changes within the company which brings us to the biggest point of the film...While the concept and plot of The Circle is something many in the world can relate to, its overall direction and dialogue is a major disappointment and was a letdown for me. All the team members that surround Mia deliver dialogue that is over the top and painful to watch. After all, these people are all supposed to be adults at a major I.T. company, right? Emma Watson also tries her best, but the script hurts her as a lead character.As stated above, the King actor himself, Tom Hanks is 2nd credited in this film but is really here to mostly speak on stage as ""The Circle"" crowd and team members laugh and call out during his presentations - it's all cheesy. I should also note that the actors of Mia's parents, Bill Paxton & Glenne Headly, both passed away in 2017. The thought that this is their last performance and their last film makes me wish it was something better than this.Overall, if you enjoy technology talk, sure, some of that is found here, along with creative ideas and discussions within ""The Circle"" that show some worth. It is the characters dialogue and predictable script that I found so awful to the point that halfway through the film, I actually checked my watch and let out big sigh as I found the film had one more hour to go. Danny Elfman's score is also felt out of place and tried to be something that just didn't suit this film (rare for the talented Elfman!). The actors all do what they can here but in the end, it's not enough for me to recommend this film.2.3/10

98,shobanchittuprolu,The Circle is a major disappointment of this year which wasted a strong content.,5,24 July 2017,"The Circle (2017): There's something quite perfectly pitched about the release of The Circle. A techno thriller which has great message in it and brilliant star-cast (Emma Watson,Tom Hanks) and impressive trailers.But the movie is now one of the biggest disasters of 2017.So what went wrong? Plot: When Mae (Emma Watson) is hired to work for the world's largest and most powerful tech and social media company, she sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. As she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes, begin to affect the lives and future of her friends, family and that of humanity.My Review: There is a scene in the movie where Mae Holland introduces a new feature named Soul Search which helps in finding the persons anywhere in the world.She uses it to catch an escaped convict but when all the members force her to search her ex-boyfriend things go haywire.This is one of the best scenes of the year but unfortunately the only best scene in the movie.With a strong plot in his hands,James Posoldt wasted his opportunity by making this bland film.With Emma Watson leading the way, and Tom Hanks, Patton Oswalt, Karen Gillan, and John Boyega in supporting roles the movie is less likely to disappoint but it happened.The film is filled with intriguing questions about the balance of our social and professional lives and how they intermingle, and whether, with increased surveillance and the knowledge that we're being watched, our behavior would gradually improve. But The Circle is all foreplay, playfully prodding without providing a satisfying payoff.The Circle literally plays as if it has been written by a bunch of elites that have spent a little bit too much time on their phones, decided that the world has become too dependent on technology, and now they're going to make a film that saves people from themselves. It's smug, condescending, and completely without incident.Dialogue too often drowns in exposition, a heavy hand taking over when a lighter touch is required.Even performances are not note-worthy.SO,The Circle is a major disappointment of this year which wasted a strong content.My rating 5.25/10",The Circle

As for the events that led to Mercer's death, the story really did try to do its best in bobbing and weaving its way out of faulting Mae, but was it enough?From there, Ellar Coltrane is an actor that I'm not at all familiar with, so perhaps he may be good in other features, however in The Circle, his acting ability was poor, and his character motivation didn't help him much either, while Boyega's character Ty, was a dangling character, who would've almost felt like he existed only in Mae's head, had it not been for Bailey mentioning him.Overall however, though The Circle is questionable in regards to some choices in story line and direction, and has a couple of characters being underdeveloped, the movie actually is quite enjoyable, largely due to Tom Hanks, while Emma, Paxton and Karen also deliver some decent performances. 6/10.",The Circle

103,CabbageCustard,Very disappointing treatment of a worthy issue.,4,4 December 2017,"Let me start of by saying that The Circle is not a boring movie and that's because it deals with an important and interesting issue. It is, however, a very disappointing movie because it examines this issue in such a hamfisted manner and is lacking in any sort of subtlety. The viewer is not invited to draw their own conclusions (albeit with some gentle leading); instead the conclusion the makers of the movie want you to make is shoved in your face right from the outset. As a result, this is not a movie that will leave you thinking. Instead, it is one you will forget fairly quickly.The acting throughout ranges from ordinary to bad. Big talents like Tom Hanks are wasted. Emma Watson makes a very dull and unrelatable hero. It is sad to see Bill Paxton and Glenne Headley wasted in what surely must have been one of the last roles for each of them. The movie fails as a character study of the individuals concerned. The motivations of the main characters are not examined at all and the film is the poorer for it. Tom Hanks plays a Steve Jobs style figure who runs a company called The Circle, a techno company similar to Apple or Google, whose influence reaches into all areas of its customers lives. The movie never looks at the character's motivations. Similarly, it doesn't examine the motives of his sinister henchman. It does not explain why the hero initially embraces the company's philosophy to an almost ridiculous and barely believable extent and then does a back flip. It does not explain why the friend who drew her into the company suddenly abandons its philosophies and runs away. It doesn't explain why the company founder, who constantly lurks in the background, is so aghast at what the company has become. Unbelievable scenarios abound.As a result of this lack of exposition and subtlety, the movie is more of a caricature than something we can relate to or recognize. It fails to make the impact it should.There is a very good premise behind The Circle and an important issue to be examined.

Although one could misinterpret the film as pure propaganda in favor, in the end I believe that the 2-3 co-stars who were opposed lead to it, showed that the film wanted to demonstrate the impact of such violations or even satirize such a situation, rather than propagandize in favor.

108,gcsman,This is actually a horror film,6,29 December 2017,"It's been said (and unfortunately I've forgotten the source) that personal privacy has been only a short and temporary period in human history. Before the mid-1800's or so, most people in the world lived in small towns where everybody knew everybody else, and you didn't usually move very far from where you were born. Then from ca.1850 to ca.2000 (almost), most people lived in big cities where one could stay anonymous and maintain a thoroughly private life, if desired. Now (21st century), most people live on social media and have quite voluntarily given their lives over to social media, marketing forces, government eyes, and every other form of internet footprint. Privacy is gone. How do we feel about that?I give this movie credit for tackling a big contemporary issue: how much control over our lives are we giving away to the digital/on-line world, and how much of that is justified? In this rapidly emerging Web world who has the power? Who watches the watchers? Most of all, what is happening to the shreds of personal privacy? It's just lacking a bit in execution and IMO needed more fleshing out of the plot details. But the issues are serious, and for real. The star of this movie, and who is in virtually every scene, is young Mae (Emma Watson), who gets a job interview with the famous and mysterious Circle corporation, succeeds, and proceeds to rapidly work her way up the company's ladder after an initial rocky start in Customer Relations. Tom Hanks and Patton Oswalt are supporting players as the guiding geniuses of Circle (a company that is quite obviously intended to look like G*****, complete with a big 'campus' of numerous building parcelled out for purposes intended to absorb the entire lives of its employees).The springboard of the plot is Circle's new bit of technology they call SeeChange, a camera the size and shape of a big marble that can be put (or worn) anywhere, will upload its video feed continuously to the Circle sites, and is virtually undetectable. Mae seizes the opportunity to 'go transparent' -- i.e. wear one of these things 24/7 -- and proves to be a natural at this game. (Shades of 'The Truman Show', but in this case voluntarily.) We see loads of pop-up messages that come and go on the screen from her enormous crowd of internet followers, like an advanced and wide-open Twitter feed. Three sub-plots take up bits of screen time but prove to be important later: Mae's on-and-off boyfriend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) wants to stay out of this no-privacy world and ends up tragically swallowed whole by an impressive 'crowdsourcing' search engine that Mae creates. Her parents (played by Glenne Headly and Bill Paxton -- sadly, both of whom died this year) are bystanders who see their personal lives lost. The most important thread, though, is the one with underground programmer Ty (John Boyega), who has found out what the Circle's directors are really doing under the cover of releasing its 'wonderful' inventions, and takes it upon himself to enlist Mae. The resolution comes only in the last few minutes of the film, when Mae neatly turns the tables on her bosses. But, what did Ty actually know? Frustratingly this is never explained. We're left with just the vague impression that the Circle is aiming at taking over the world (duh), but that just stays vague.What happens in the movie is now happening, bit by bit, in the world around us. That's why this is a horror film and it's no less horrible for happening in bright sunlight with cheerful people .

Those infected with the insidious disease, spreading it like religious slaves to the new recruits. Brrr.Yes, that's all good ... but the script isn't: It starts off well, gets heavier, gets you on side ...Then ends. It just ... ends. Half-way through telling the story.The point it is trying to get across with Emma Watson's character is a good one, and very dark indeed.It covers badly needed ground such as YES, privacy IS critically important to a society, and NO, just because somebody is rich does NOT mean their ramblings and projects carry any weight whatsoever! It does careful, side-long bombing runs of the Church Of Jobs and the Church of Zuckerberg and several other deserving, soft targets.But the story execution is so poor it just kind of plops out of nowhere, drops onto the road, then flops around dying. There is no impact.And it misses some very important points such as hype=unsecure: the more more hyped-up something is, the more likely it is to be hackable, just due to the ridiculous pressures placed upon its development and deployment. Or the more everyone 'knows' (THINKS they know) about each other ... the more of a FANTASY the world becomes, it doesn't become more REALISTIC. All missed, along with many other points.The Circle IMHO is worth watching, but it's just nowhere near as good as it could have been.Shoulda hired a writer, folks.- -- ---",The Circle

111,rutzelb,Social Media Gone Wild,7,2 August 2017,"Mae (Emma Watson) gets her dream job working for The Circle, a powerful Tech and Social Media company that pushes transparency, company parties and wants to put very small cameras all around the world to help humanity be more transparent. Mae buys into all this big time although her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) sees problems with a lack of privacy. Mae allows herself to wear a camera so everyone (even world-wide) can see her every move. Founder of The Circle Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) and his friend Stenton (Patton Oswalt) make all the decisions for The Circle.Somewhere in the beginning I thought Mae would take another tack (ala Sally Fields), but was surprised that she not only bought into all this, but even suggested more scenarios that would further inhibit peoples' privacy. (I can only guess where this will go)Overall the acing is very good, but we keep wondering when Mae will come to her senses. Her former boyfriend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) tries to tell her what she is doing is wrong, but Mae says she can fix his concerns. Notables: Bill Paxton as Vinnie, Mae's father who has MS; Glenne Headly as Bonnie, Mae's mother; John Boyega as Ty, who developed the software for The Circle, but doesn't agree that The Circle is collecting data and taking privacy away from people. I thought he would be more of a factor, but not to be until ..until he becomes part of that twist you keep asking about. I must say that Tom Hanks' presence in here gives this movie a big boost.

In terms of execution the movie is fine. The acting is good, there is some great cinematography, and the movie's pacing is fine. The problem really is the plot. The problem comes in the lessons learned, the people that Mae interacts with, and the fact that in general Mae is just a very unlikable person.

113,RIK-22,"Great subject matter, but fails to make its point.",3,10 August 2017,"So we've got a number of issues at play here:Social Media - Big Data - Privacy - Mob RuleAll interesting social subjects, which could be addressed in various interesting ways, unfortunately this move, really fails to address any of them adequately. The pacing of the film is all wrong, way too much time is taken to set-up the story and then hardly any time for the ""pay off"", if you want to call it that.It's also very hard to believe some of the characters actions and lack of morals. The Mob Rule, is probably the most over-riding theme, but it probably wasn't the intention of the movie.The movie seems to be confusing a cult / religious / dictatorship / brainwashing type scenario with Social Media and Big Data. The fundamental difference is that Social Media contains all views, both people who agree and disagree. In this film, everyone is on-board and on message. I could accept the brainwashed people, who worked on the campus, to some degree, but not the world at large.Social Media, enables people to express themselves and connect, as per the human race, you will get some people agreeing, some not, people with different interests, agendas, criminals, bullying, etc. Social Media, doesn't dictate to people how to act.Big Data is worrying as who in the end is able to use that data for positive or negative uses.Mae's rise from nobody to world star, in the Circle world, for no real reason. Just because you witnessed her rather uninteresting existence (without seeing the bathroom scene's btw). I fail to see who could be bothered to view that, no one would care, would they?The actions are too extreme for it to work as a social commentary. The inevitable death scene, was too contrived, to be taken seriously and relied on the general public to be doing nothing else, but be willing to chase after, harass and film people, not caring a jot about their safety or others. You would assume criminal charges for drone use, people harassing people, these would still be in place, regardless of Social Media.Overall its feels like a failed Black Mirror episode and a missed opportunity.",The Circle

It is recommendable because it shows that to work in Hollywood, one must have an IQ lower than that of an amoeba and conform to leftist ideals.Of course, The Circle, can be seen as a critique of Google, millenials and their constant interconnectedness, the rise of, as I like to say of ""Homo Stupidus"", a creature that is a direct by-product of the ""internet wisdom"", social media, liberalism, etc. But, the whole thing is done heavy-handedly.Summarizing: ""The Circle"" is as empty and devoid of interesting ideas as the teen sitting next to you thumbing incessantly a smart phone.

118,barbagvido,"Makes you think, but it's not completely memorable",8,10 May 2017,"The Circle is a movie based on a novel by Dave Eggers. It stars Emma Watson and Tom Hanks and it's set in a near future where they have this company called The Circle which is pretty much like Google, but even bigger. Emma Watson stars as Mae Holland, a young woman who gets a job in the company, but when she sees what the company really is doing, which side will she take?I have read the novel and even though it was flawed, it was an interesting read, so I was kinda excited about the movie. The movie isn't perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as everyone says. I didn't find it boring at all, you just need to get invested in the story and know that this is not your typical dystopian story. This really shows what life might be like one day, so not much major events happen. That made it feel a bit more realistic, but it also made it feel a bit forgettable. That's the biggest flaw of this film. It makes quite an impact on you when you finish watching it and you won't be able to stop thinking about it for the next few hours. But that's more because of the message, not because of the movie itself. But that message will get under your skin. You will shiver during some scenes in the second half and especially at the last shot. And the creepiest thing about it is how easily a large percentage of humanity could be tricked by propaganda. That's extremely well shown in Eamon Bailey, the charismatic leader of the organization played by Tom Hanks. He's smart, he's funny, he's down-to-earth, and he's very likable. And that's the scariest thing. He's one of those people who would probably manage to talk you into killing yourself in less than 5 minutes. He's such a charismatic presence and Hanks was the perfect choice for the role. Regardless of his plans for the future, you just can't hate this guy! That's how easily we can be brainwashed and the movie warns us about a lot of things going on in the world right now. When you finish it, you will think a lot about the points this movie made. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I also like how they eliminated some extremely unnecessary subplots from the book and made the story a lot more straightforward without any distractions.Overall, even though it's not amazing, I recommend this film simply for the message itself. It's really not that bad.",The Circle

They should have rudimentary knowledge about the material. Or be humble enough to do some research into the subject matter, instead of just trying to ""wing it"".That in a nutshell is what happened here, ask any computer, or web builder if I'm wrong. The movie made a ton of mistakes in that area. Not withstanding there's also no character build whatsoever.A plea to Hollywood. In entertainment TV and Movies there's this new age mythological character I call the Hacker Supreme. The character is everywhere and overused so much it's quickly become tiresome to watch.

Sure, the message they're going for comes across and manages to be a little affecting. We are presented with a scenario were almost nothing can be private anymore. Your everyday life can be seen by thousands of people all over the world. So, what really worked was the subject on surveillance because the filmmakers manage to show how it can go well and how it can go horribly wrong. It's true that we are living in an era full of social media. It makes you wonder how far it can go and if it's all for the better or not? That's what got to me. It did make me think that maybe we are spending too much time online. Sometimes it's time to step out. The thing is: There's a lot of other movies that explore this and most of them are better.I enjoyed how the movie looks and the soundtrack is alright. The problem is that the plot is just bland. The characters feel like the actors playing themselves. It's too focused on getting a point across that we don't have someone to care for. There is that part later in the movie were it does get a bit affecting, but that's basically it. Another issue is that it gets extremely exaggerated when it comes to what can go wrong with the ideas brought up. You have so much to work with and you bring it to such a level that it becomes unbelievable and almost laughable. I could not buy the fact that more people wouldn't think more clear throughout the movie. It made it even more difficult to care for what's going on. You are probably gonna find yourself waiting for the next Tom Hanks speech (Trust me, you get plenty of that) or wondering why John Boyega is in this movie. Emma Watson is OK here, I don't think she was given the right material though. They are all talents and I have nothing against them. But when these guys can't elevate the material given to them, then I'm sorry to say that we don't have very good direction. This is also Bill Paxton and Glenne Headly's final film roles. It was kind of sad seeing them here, but I will say that they both did great jobs with their supporting roles.The best thing I can say is that it's watchable. The Tom Hanks speech scenes are fun at first, but after a while you realize that this character pretty much does the same thing over and over. Someone used a good word to describe ""The Circle"" and I'm gonna repeat it here: One note. This concept is interesting, but if you wanna catch peoples attention on the surveillance subject, then I think a documentary would work better. Yeah, it's a mediocre one.

Just imagine you are on your annual holiday/vacation only to be tracked down by your friends, foes, or workplace there will be no place you can wind down.The movie runs out of steam at the end with bit part players not properly fleshed out, though by the end credits, these are done in a style to make you think you are still watching.Finally and strangely my name appeared in the end credits, co- incidence ?",The Circle

When she nervously joins the massive group of ambiguous 'circlers', she gets drawn in a plot and aim of enriching the world through use of ultimate surveillance and the death of privacy.Based off Dave Eggers novel, the Circle is full of potential with its intriguing narrative reflecting the current society values of technology, and social media and where this will take us in the future. But however this spins out of control in an obsessive, wooden, and hollow film trying to say something but not very successfully. Surrounded by a plot then another plot, then other small subplots, trying to keep the film 'connected' eventually falls flat on its face. At first the film becomes the start of every college movie, then right into a evil cooperation film, which then turns into prequel to the Matrix.What first majorly fails the film is Ponsoldt's directing, who clearly demonstrates ambition throughout the film, but struggles to keep it together with a poor screenplay and weak constructed scenes. When I say 'juggle' Ponsoldt seems to twist the direction of where the film wants to be. With is intriguing ideas, it first appears to be going against theses concepts, but somehow then creates a glorifying theme to it, which becomes very sickening by the end. The substance is creepy but the film does very little to express this, which makes the film confused in its intentions.Combined with he poor script is incredible wooden acting coming from the ensemble cast. With an A-list cast like this, what could go wrong. Emma Watson at first does well to play the suspicious outsider of the Circle, if that was her role throughout the film, she then become a blank changeable face, not the character that we trust and see this world of the Circle through. John Boyega is okay for the few seconds he is even present, and then becomes a extra for the remaining time. Tom Hanks is just having fun with himself and successfully so in the first lecture scene, but then is just there with no real life. I was hoping that Hanks could be the one redeeming factor but unfortunately his' role is so side lined his barely mentionable. The real poor contribution is sadly delivered by Eller Coltrane as Mae's childhood friend Mercer, who although is not an important character has some of the most lifeless scenes of acting I have ever seen, which is a real shame since Coltrane made his name in the magnificent Boyhood (2014).Its not frustratingly bad, just weirdly bad. Not 100% of the time though, the film does have some gripping moments which may still entertain once you get pass the creepiness hidden in the Circle. But this never lasts.Its hard to tell whether the film is achieving what it wants. If it wants to make a statement on technology, then it does successfully does so with a ending feeling of disgust, but if it is simply a film then it can become an easily unlikable film. 5.3/10",The Circle

In reality, the movie is a lazy hodge-podge of ideas that probably sounded relevant and edgy in a brainstorm session...but then were just dropped in the movie with no real thought or connection and the producers simply thought that the combination of these uber-cool insights about privacy-in-the-social-media age and the star power of Emma Watson and Tom Hanks was enough to guarantee a hit.As such, the first act of the movie IS actually quite engaging. I was intrigued by what appeared to be parallels drawn between Silicon Valley culture and cults such as Scientology (even the idea of going ""Transparent"" as a stand-in for going ""clear"") but the woeful lack of any character or plot development quickly reveals the hollowness at the heart of the movie. This hollowness then rings throughout the rest of the movie as pointless characters exist either just to enable the climax (which doesn't actually make sense as the motives of the company leaders are never explicitly revealed to be sinister) OR characters exist for seemingly no reason at all!All in all, a very, VERY disappointing movie as it could have been something much, MUCH better if it just hadn't rested on it's imagined laurels.",The Circle

So I was eager to watch this film.What... a.... disaster.The first thing that I noticed: its pacing issues, which are generally attributed to choppy, poor video editing. The fecal storm was piled onto by absolutely horrific acting by Emma Watson and most of the supporting cast. Even Tom Hanks looks out of place and like he is going through the motions in this one. One of the most painful moments in the film is when Emma Watson's character capitulates to some weird ideas overnight and her once-stable and supportive best friend suddenly becomes a malicious goth mess overnight. Neither one of them pulls it off well. It was partly the fault of an atrocious script that forced them to make a complete 180 in their characters.When directing teachers teach you how to make a film they emphasize that you should make a few thousand dollars look like you spent one million dollars. Well, this film looks like a young, inexperienced upstart had a multi-million dollar budget out of the gate.Aside from some fairly good comedic moments (and I don't think that this film was designed as a comedy) it's an absolute disaster.

It needed to be more subtle and more build up gradually. The English do a better job where subtlety is required. Atmosphere was lacking and character development could have been much better as well. Connections were not made and omissions were not dealt with using visual story telling to help bring it altogether. The end product should have been treated as an outline so that a more polished and connected movie could be realised. Some sequences needed further development and fleshing out.

IMDB users rate this currently 5.3 perhaps only because people like Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. That is generous and I'm more inclined to agree with the lowly 16% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But seriously, from a major production perspective, it has to be perhaps the worst movie of the year. Almost everything was sadly wrong, or more accurately laughable. If it was made as a comedy satire, it might work but by taking itself seriously, it's like taking PeeWee Herman seriously. Emma Watson was a decent, popular child actress (Harry Potter series) but really doesn't have true thespian skills. Director James Ponsoldt makes a great Thanksgiving turkey here. Everything is wooden. Supporting actors are seriously bad. Karen Gillan plays her best friend Annie almost shines in her bathroom privacy chat. The most notable acting role was by the late Bill Paxton (he died before the release of the film) who played the protagonist's father. Tom Hanks can't save this film. The script is weak and tooooo predictable. Adding to the laughability is Danny Elfman's soundtrack who had a memorable Edward Scissorshand soundtrack but this one sounds like a xylophone played by a 6 year old. The problem is the soundtrack and supporting acting just gives a lack of seriousness. The stage presentations a la TEDx only worked for Tom Hanks in his initial SeeChange presentation which was fascinating but anything that follows crashes and burns.

Portrays very accurately the cult-like environment that is the standard in the IT industry. It goes way beyond ""teamwork"" and deep into the unquestioning acceptance and willful propagation of new and ""progressive"" social norms and belief systems that are ultimately and fundamentally against human nature and our basic liberties.Of course the guys (and gals) at the top of the food chain know this and all the warm fuzzy virtue-speak and social peer pressure (for your own good) is ultimately designed to establish behavioral control which results in power for the top guys who do not follow the same rules they coerce onto those who work for (and indeed are now dependent on) them.It demonstrates not only the personal dangers of selling your soul to the company store, but if enough people buy in to the BS in exchange for big salaries and all the benefits (perhaps even heath care for your very sick father), society itself can be heavily influenced to change in order to serve the very few but very rich and powerful which then allows them to gain political control of law makers and others who might be a threat to their domination.This movie was made 4 years ago. The reality of what it depicts is chilling and scary because it is real. It was real then and even more so now. If anyone thinks this is a purely fictional film, they are completely ignorant of the world around them OR they are benefiting from the lie and cannot or will not back out.Judging from other reviews, there is a lot of blind hate for this film. Hate that is not very well articulated, explained or justified. My only conclusion here is that the movie has struck a nerve with the social media industry and all the good little soldiers who work for them have been tasked to slam this movie and give it a bad rating so people will be less likely to view it. This in and of itself proves the point of the film.It is a good film. It is well made, the acting is good and the story is engaging with interesting characters. There were a few rather blatant logic problems that made it less than a 9 or 10 for me but the main objective of the movie did not suffer for it.

136,Oberrated,"High potential, disappointing result",3,28 April 2017,"'The Circle' is a film that tries to be more intelligent than it actually is. While possessing a quality message and material to potentially make a gripping and mysterious film, it falls short with hollow and forgetful characters/performances, wildly off-the-wall concepts, and many plot holes and questions that can be formed with no answer to them. While I have no knowledge of the novel, I would imagine it being significantly better than this film-adaptation.

137,stebird,"Total transparency, we see it all",5,31 July 2017,"A terrible film with a frightening glimpse into our potential future, with social media on the rise and people becoming more and more transparent, The Circle takes things to the extreme showing you just how bad things can get. The film is centred around a powerful technology company called, wait for it, the circle..., Mae, played by the ever reliable Emma Watson, lands herself a dream job at the circle, but once arriving at this freak show, she soon realises that all is not as it seems. Everyone appears to be computerised and robotic, like the powerful technology they work with has completely taken over their lives..., Mae works in the Customer satisfaction department, whatever the Hell that's supposed to mean, I really couldn't get my head around what the job actually was. Tom Hanks is in it too, he plays the big chief and founder of the circle, Eamon Bailey, it is this man that encourages Mae to engage in groundbreaking experiments, these experiments appear to be unethical and greatly intrude on her personal life. Not a fan of The Circle at all, yes I'm guessing The Circle is a send up of Google, pretty obvious, the sole purpose I believe of the film is to educate people in the dangers of technology getting too far out of control, more like pandering to a wide audience more so than actual storytelling, hence I rated The Circle so low. Nothing more to say, and not even bringing in the mega-power of Tom Hanks and Emma Watson could save the film.",The Circle

Movie is terribly confused with what message is trying to get through.
Is online exhibicionism, is total invigilation god or bad? Your point movie?

139,ElliesWonder,Enlogical and poorly made up ending,7,21 August 2017,"Spoilers included. 7/10The movie's beginning has some interesting concept, but as a group, it didn't deliver well, plots development at the end are so dramatized and confusedly illogical. The scenes grabbed my attention earlier, its background is empathetic, technology is close to our modem reality, people like to share and filter themselves throughout the internet. Made me wonder what dangerous coming from the omnipotent internet, how people live under the camera, live to be recorded everything.What's the story about? (Spoiler)
In this film's background, people only use ONE APP invented by the company Circle. TrueYou, an app combines all from Facebook, Instagram, Google and other accounts, people only need 1 account and 1 password. Life and social become easy and connected all through TrueYou. Before long, the company designed to release more programs, such like the binding registered vote, monthly payment, and missing people search engine, TrueYou is recording every breath, every minute of people's life.The character, Mae was a new employer in beginning, she was excited to work with a creative and sharing company; before long, she was selected to be a representative of Circle, by wearing camera and tracking system bracelet all days, to record her life, and share with the world, being completely transparent. It was a creepy life, even bathroom time needs to count in 3 minutes. Mae lost contact with her best friend and family because they can't bare with overladen exposure and online critics.It was a thrilling plot, until the death of Mae's friend. His death was caused by Mae' live representation, he got chased by unknown strangers, and crushed his car from the rushed.After this scene, the movie turned into a joke, a nonsense plot.Mae was sad after her friend's death, she stayed home for 3 days, then she recovered! She came back to Circle and started to revenge her bosses because of some an illogical IDK reasons. After the 'revenge', with Mae's brighter future presentation voice-over, the screen turned white and switched to future, where millions of cameras around, people all live under recoding.This ending is ridiculous, illogical and poorly made up. Character behave inconsistently. She was tired to the online-show-life already, after her friend's death, she shed her tear for 3 days, and suddenly start a revenge? To who? She was the major reason caused the tragedy! The black future ending is even worse, so unexplainable!! What a poor plot writing, Last 15 minutes totally ruined the entire movie and a good concept.7/10 like some concept, meh",The Circle
140,makleen2,"Wastes a great cast, visual style, and concept on a mediocre and poorly-executed plot",6,28 September 2017,"The Circle (2017) stars Emma Watson as Mae Holland, a young woman who lands a dream job at a tech company called The Circle. Skeptical at first, she comes to embrace The Circle's vision of total openness and transparency, until ultimately uncovering the company's nefarious agenda. It is based on a novel of the same name by Dave Eggers. The Circle is visually impressive, blending current and speculative technology to bring to life a world where the digital and physical overlap. If Apple made a movie, it would look like this. Clean, simple, elegant. Unfortunately, its message is lost in a plot thinner than an iPhone 7.The Circle was founded by Tom Stenton (Patton Oswalt) and Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) and designed by Ty Lafitte (John Boyega). Since growing into a Google-esque tech giant, Ty Lafitte has faded into the background, becoming an Emmanuel Goldstein-like figure who quietly opposes its agenda. The Circle integrates everything about your life into one system, seeking to acquire an ever-increasing amount of personal data, including placing cameras all over the world to monitor and analyze all human activity.The Circle is a progressive and hip company that provides everything for its employees on its massive campus. Parallels to Apple and Steve Jobs are obvious (Eamon Bailey even holds casual talks where he announces products to his employees). Employees are peer pressured into conformity and relying on The Circle for social acceptance, entertainment, and even health. While employees are continually encouraged to ""become more transparent,"" Stenton and Bailey operate in secrecy, hiding their future plans and true motivations. Their agenda is so secret, not even the film's audience ever finds out what they're up to.Is privacy important? Is transparency always good? Those are the questions I thought this film set out to explore. Don't expect any clear answers. Mae Holland is converted to The Circle's philosophy after she steals a kayak and would have drowned in San Francisco Bay if not for the cameras secretly recording her activity. She decides to go ""fully transparent,"" broadcasting her every experience through cameras. Later, however, she is pressured into using this technology to find her ex-boyfriend, Mercer (Ellar Coltrane), who flees the cameras and drives off the San Francisco Bridge. Though depressed, she determines to ""fix"" the system. ""When a plane crashes, you make planes safer, you don't stop flying,"" she tells her parents.She ""fixes the system"" by turning The Circle's technology against Stenton and Bailey, with the help of Ty Lafitte. ""We're so f---ed,"" Bailey whispers to Stenton, anticipating the reveal of their sinister plot. The audience, however, is never told what they were planning to do. So the film's message is, I guess, complete transparency is good depending on who uses it. Without knowing the consequences of Stenton and Bailey's success, however, it's difficult to say who is right and who is wrong. Their technology saved Mae's life, and despite one embarrassing moment involving her parents caught on film, there are really no negative consequences to Mae's 24-hour surveillance.In fact, the ""total transparency"" portion was one of the weakest spots in the film. It would have been a great opportunity to illustrate why privacy is important, yet Mae seems perfectly content. She never gets sick or has a bad day, crippling self-doubt, a clumsy accident, vulnerable moment, or anything that would suggest being watched all the time is undesirable or even impractical, except for that one moment when she accidentally sees her parents having sex. She never takes a shower, has indigestion, or feels lonely and cries? Who are the millions of people watching her all day at work? Don't they also have jobs? I think The Circle would have been a much better movie if it had a more realistic plot. Say a jealous coworker somehow uses The Circle's technology or its social engineering to get revenge on Mae, messing with her life or destroying her personal relationships, over career advancement or a love interest. That's a scenario millions of working Americans can relate to. Instead, we're expected to believe thousands of people who work and socialize together, even on weekends, never have any personality conflicts, fall in love, hook up, or get into fights? No one at this company even has any children. I'm not sure if the filmmakers deliberately excluded those common experiences, or they were just being lazy.There were some great moments in the film. I loved the comments that popped up on screen from ""viewers"" responding to events in Mae's life. Imagine if your life was a YouTube channel, and anyone could leave comments as events unfolded. Ridiculous. In another scene, Mae walks past a sculpture protesting a dictatorial regime and mentions how millions of Circle users have sent ""frowns"" to that dictator. It was a hilarious jab at pointless social media activism.Ultimately, The Circle was visually interesting, but failed to have an impact. It currently has a 17 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, much lower than Emma Watson's other recent release, a Beauty and the Beast remake. Critics describe it as sloppy, aimless, frustrating, self-sabotaging, and a spectacular failure. More than that, it wastes a great cast, visual style, and concept on a mediocre and poorly-executed plot. What a disappointment.",The Circle

Such an interesting concept (how technological advancement will effect humanity) and a good cast. One problem. The plot was grossly under developed and the ending was weak and predictable. First big issue, the main character seems to have a complete 180 on her beliefs halfway through the movie without a plausible reason (honestly I was waiting for her to have been drugged or something).Second big issue, you don't understand what the bad guys motivation is. Are they die hard believers? Are they just doing it for money and power? And how are they so ridiculously stupid that they'd allow themselves to be taken down so easily?!Now the sneaky thing about this film is that they develop the plot JUST ENOUGH that the story will keep you engaged the entire time (and these days that's rare).Problem is that if you were looking for something a little deeper and philosophical on such a complex and important topic you would walk away feeling unsatisfied.",The Circle
143,stroggos,Stylish Silicon Valley fairytale about privacy and technology,7,28 October 2017,"Mae starts her new job at the circle, a tech company reminiscent of Google and Apple. Just like many Silicon Valley companies, 'The Circle' sees itself as more than just bringing technology to the people, it tries to change the world, wanting to make it a more open, sharable and accountable place. As Mae gets sucked into the community of 'The Circle', she realizes that she has to give up more and more of her privacy...The Circle is very much like the TV series Black Mirror, a movie that skillfully asks you to be afraid of the near future, not the distant future. The technology displayed is already there, it's just a matter of how it is used and how power is centralized, who has access to private data and all that—issues that we are already facing today. In that sense, The Circle is timely and the questions it poses are very relevant to us today.As a movie, The Circle definitely has its flaws, mostly in terms of plot structure and character development. A few characters are deeply underexplored, with some characters being introduced that later on play almost no role. There is a sense that everything will move towards an epic conclusion, but in the end, a lot of threads are simply left hanging, with no satisfactory resolution. Some characters change their opinion rather abruptly, and in particular our main protagonist, Mae, is a bit difficult to read and her motifs are not always clear.Despite these issues, I found that The Circle was quite enjoyable. As a fan of techno, I loved the beautiful electronic score, and I loved the general sunny ""Bay Area"" feel to the whole piece. Cinematographically, this is a well done movie all throughout.All in all, a decent-to-good movie that could have been a masterpiece with a better script... but that is still entertaining nonetheless and will definitely get you thinking about the future of technology, social media and privacy.",The Circle
144,jcjs333,Kinda Corny But,8,6 August 2017,"This flick makes me feel even better about being sober from Facebook for 2 years. Social media, basically, is dehumanizing making cookie cutter people, one dimensional robot-like creatures. There was a movie '1984' depicting a totalitarian future. And, we are approaching that. This show was kind syrupy and over exaggerated in acting but right on with it's message. The more adept a person is at 'being social' the less personable they can be. I'm glad i 'grew up', 'was a teen', in the 60's. People are exemplified by their 'cars'. In the 50's and 60's you have distinctive, interesting, fascinating, beautiful, unique, daring automobiles with wonderful character and the populace looked forward to next years 'model' with anticipation and enthusiasm whether they were going to purchase one or not. Slowly, people, as well as cars have become 'the same'. I can barely tell one from another at a distance. And, close up a car, like a person doesn't look much different than any other car or person. So, people nowadays try to fill their void with 'social' media but , as one becomes , social they become a 'machine' not personal. Only, flesh and bone human being standing in front of me breathing in and out while i listen to the dance of tone, movement and gesture is real, unique, beautiful, fascinating and wonderful. People today are 'cookie cutter', social media 'tweeters'. I'd rather be a 'tweaker' than a 'tweeter'. I'd rather have a 1957 Chevy than a 2017 Chevy. We are only as 'sick as the secrets we keep'. This is true only to a degree. Secrets are wonderful things , often measuring the value of friendship. People can't be alone and love it. As far as 'Circles' push to have 'everyone vote'. A country with 100% turnout at the polls is a country in trouble. Dictatorships or countries in horrible trouble have super high turnouts. If the poll turnout is around 80%, let's say, we have a country that is doing pretty well with people confident in the leaders not a complacent populace. We do not want everyone voting. This is not desirable. This is an excellent show at trying to get at the message 'enough is enough'. But, i'm afraid it's up to the individual to protect themselves from 'big brother' because business will eat ya up unless one takes care of themselves. Microsoft will gobble us up if we're aren't careful. This isn't nuts, either. Big business is scary stuff making automatons out of the populace and , only old people , oldsters like myself , can see how today's youth can't see it or know it's happening to them. Robots made to think they are 'real' by making them 'social' not personal. There's a camera or a computer or a cell phone between one person and another and they are 'all looking the same and acting the same'. p.s I think 'Social Newwork', the movie, was poor with lousy sound track.

Instead of continuing to build the stakes and tension, as the Circle employees and users, who are caricatures of young social-media obsessed Milleneals, start getting increasingly cartoonishly weird and exaggerated in their privacy-invading behavior, ignorantly unaware of the harm they are doing, all the build-up just kind of tapers off part way through, leaving me asking ""That's it?""",The Circle

152,RLTerry1,Full of endless circular logic and irony,6,28 April 2017,"Director James Ponsoldt's The Circle depicts the story of a not-so-distant future, or perhaps an alternative present, in which one company dominates digital media, data gathering, and surveillance services. Based upon the four-year-old novel by author Dave Eggers, you'll notice some stark similarities between this motion picture narrative and the smash hit TV series Black Mirror. The biggest difference between the two is that The Circle is fast-faced and poorly written whereas Black Mirror is a slow-burning but well-written anthology series. In addition to the similarities between the aforementioned, there are certainly elements of The Truman Show in this movie as well. With a powerhouse cast, brilliant composer (Danny Elfman), and excellent editing, The Circle appears to have what a blockbuster needs; however, the hollow characters, poor character development, fractured subplots, and overall diegesis hold the film back from reaching the impact that it could have had. Having taken a digital media and privacy class in graduate school, and published a few articles, this is a film that I was looking forward to in order to analyze how the social commentary or commentary on the human condition regarding reasonable expectations of privacy and big data were integrated into the plot. Sadly, the screenplay was not strong or developed significantly enough to provide big data and privacy discussions.Mae Holland (Emma Watson) hates her job at the water company, so she is incredibly excited when her friend Annie (Karen Gillan) lands Mae an interview at The Circle, the world's most powerful technology and social media company. Mae's fear of unfulfilled potential impresses the recruiters at The Circle and she lands the opportunity of a lifetime. After Mae puts herself into harm's way but rescued, thanks to The Circle's newest surveillance and data gathering system, she is encouraged by the company founder Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) to take a more active role in technology development by participating in an experiment that puts Mae's life on display for the world (in the vein of The Truman Show) to see. Once Mae turns on that camera, she has more ""friends"" than she ever imagined and becomes an instant online celebrity. Unfortunately, this decision will affect those closest to Mae and the negative ramifications will reach far beyond her inner circle and begin to impact humanity at large. Sometimes, people just don't want to be found or be ""social.""For all The Circle has going for it, the weak screenplay keeps it from being the blockbuster that it so desperately wants to be. A great movie typically begins with solid writing, and that is what's missing here. After five minutes (or so it seems) of opening title logos, perhaps that is indirect evidence that there were just too many hands in the pot, each trying to take the movie's narrative in a different direction. Much like Frozen plays off like two different movies crudely sewn together, The Circle appears to be one movie for the first two acts, but takes an unexpected and unfulfilling turn in the third. A couple of conspicuous unanswered questions come after Mae meets TrueYou designer and founder Ty (John Boyega). He designed the platform that launched The Circle. At one point he asks Mae to meet him in a secret tunnel (where all the servers are stored) and tells her that ""it's worse than I thought."" Great opportunity to introduce intrigue, suspense, and more. The problem is that the audience is never told what Ty finds or what happens with what he found. You can remove that whole subplot and the movie remains the same. There are other subplots that are nicely introduced, but never carried out as well. Any or all of them can be removed and the film proceeds the same. Not good. If you can remove several subplots or unfulfilled turning points and the film's diegesis remain largely untouched, then you have poor writing. The third act in and of itself leaves audiences with a hurried ending that does little to provide closure to the narrative; however, it does support the film's circular logic and irony. Hardly satisfying.In terms of the allegory here, The Circle is a Google-like company with Apple's technology. Eamon Bailey is a Steve Jobs type innovator with characteristics of Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Eric Schmidt. Thankfully, The Circle does not represent any one company, but rather combines all the most notable innovations and technological achievements of Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, and more into one globally dominating company. Antitrust issues are introduced early on, but again, that's never fully developed. The movie highlights many issues faced by private citizens, governments, and digital data driven companies today; therefore, it sets the foundation for a movie that could have been thought-provoking, but the writing hinders that ability. The irony in the movie is for every digital answer to streamlining services or bolstering conveniences, a little privacy is eroded each time. Pretty soon, if one shares enough information, the idea of privacy is extinct. Privacy was central to the plot, but it just wasn't handled in the most effective way. Concepts such as ""off the grid,"" self-proclaimed ""celebrity,"" and ""calls to action"" are displayed and discussed in the film, connecting this augmented reality to real-world issues each of us encounter or think about. One particularly interesting theme in the movie is deep friendship. Unfortunately, this was not fully fleshed as is the case with most of the movie; but still, it does get touched upon.If you were hoping for another film like the brilliant Social Network, then you will undoubtedly be disappointed. Films such as The Circle should be memorable, but unfortunately this one is very much forgettable. Coincidentally, the movie itself is as hollow as the plot and characters.Written by R.L.

153,alanpgini,Suspending disbelief is impossible with this.,2,27 July 2017,"Something happens about a half hour through this thing. They make Emma Watson into a caricature. Then they try to indoctrinate the audience, but cant quite figure out how to do it. Emma Watson becomes some kind of weird montage of a wired Orwellian hero. They then try to somehow allow her to break out of it in a way that totally defies belief. This while still trying to pitifully indoctrinate the audience. There is no continuity, and it meanders around, trying to establish that old bad corporation saw. I've often said in other forums that someone needs to tell these producers that they are creating dreck. Sort of a movie bomb police, with a car with a red light and siren that shouts, ""Stop! this is crap! Don't do it!"". Poor Tom Hanks. What was he thinking, getting involved in this? It makes his Joe versus the Volcano in his early years, look like Citizen Kane. Maybe they should have re-thought this thing when Paxton and Headly, who play Watson's parents, both croak before the movie was finished. Watson is an average skilled actress, who I don't see what the big deal is about. She is not star quality, and you have to wonder how long it will be before others realize this. The idea that Watson's character has this stunning brainstorm at the end, which the co-founder of the Circle company never would have thought of, is so idiotically unbelievable, as to leave any audience in fits of laughter.

Yes, we are so insecure that we need to harvest likes. My point is, the theme of this movie is very relevant present in our modern, 2.0 society. So it was very suitable to base a movie on this subject in 2017.As I said, It's all about the conflict between privacy and the confused desire to share. Emma Watson does a great job in a dramatic role. I'm really happy to see her in this genre of movies, I have no idea what was the point of CGI-popcorn version of Beauty and the Beast, but she does acts well in dramatic roles. The interesting point of this dystopian universe is that main character makes all the wrong decisions. She doesn't understand how bad the Circle is. She gets into a lot of trouble, she regrets it, the Circle basically destroys her family and friends, quite literally. So, she is not your average rebel who will rise a revolution against the dystopian, evil society. She just doesn't get it, at least for most of the movie. And that is really compelling, because the spectator is always afraid of her next move ""what is she doing ???"". It creates a true dramatic experience that perfectly suits the genre. Tom Hanks is quite good, too, but his role is more classic. Karen Gillan is famous for her role in Doctor Who, and she is doing just fine in the Circle, well it's also kind of Sci-Fi. We quickly care about Mae, about her family, so character development is nicely brought on. Ty, the designer of the Circle, kind of disappears from the plot though, but it didn't grind my gears. Mae discovers that the Circle is much more than a company, it's almost like a religion that absorbs all of your spare time, it does paint very well the mechanics of social pressure. You don't have to...but you will. Some scenes are really cringy, you can feel the awkwardness from Mae who discovers this weird sick world of the Circle. It reminds me of Black Mirror, but maybe Black Mirror is better constructed. The scenario and writing is still enjoyable.Music, cinematography : nothing stunning though. So I found this movie good because Mae is not as aware as we wish she was, and that makes a special dramatic experience. This movie does not try to satisfy you with a happy ending or a hero fighting the system like in Equilibrium, it makes you think about your own responsibility. That's why people gave low rating, because they felt uncomfortable with Mae's choices, but that is the whole point of the movie. PS : I agree on the misleading trailer though.",The Circle

She's carried away on a wave of optimism for the life-sharing potential of the software forgetting the importance of privacy.And it's privacy, and the way social media software can steal it from us, that's the theme of the movie. Some scenes are eerily prescient - particularly one involving voting and elections.Sadly, a strong theme and some accurate predictions don't make a movie. We need strong characters who we care about. But Mae's motivations are confused, changing and contradictory and ultimately she loses our sympathy.The other main character is the boss of the company. We could call him Jeff Zuckjob, but actually he's called Bailey and played by Tom Hanks. For such a character, a thin veneer of social largesse hides a deep obsession with what salable data can be collected, who would want to buy it, and how could they use it. What drives these people is power and ultimately money - if we're looking for Bailey's motivation: follow the money. But unfortunately the film just doesn't do that. We get no more than the vaguest of hints as to what really drives The Circle and what drives Bailey, so his character too ends up being unsatisfactory.In the end, the exposition of the theme gets in the way of the story.It's been suggested on here that a strong cast were sold on the importance of the theme before they read the screenplay. Emma, and particularly Tom with his age and experience, should really have fixed this before it got to the screen. But maybe that's not how Hollywood works these days.If you're looking to see political issues cleverly woven into a movie, try Pelican Brief, or Erin Brokovich. Oh. Actually, both with Julia Roberts. I wonder if that's significant.",The Circle
157,mancinibrown,Death to technology! Long live Technology!,3,15 October 2017,"The Circle is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a long time. A strong cast, headed by Emma Watson and Tom Hanks combined with the basics of a good story (a technology company that can't possibly be as good as it seems) should lead to strong results. Instead what is left is a mash up of ridiculous plot points and decisions.Emma Watson's character, Mae, is stuck in a dead end job when she is invited to work for The Circle, a hybrid of Google/Amazon/Apple corporation. Everything seems great at first, the campus is huge, and everyone is friendly. But Mae slowly is drawn deeper and deeper into the various different parts of the company.The ridiculousness starts with the first new invention shown off, a camera that can be hidden anywhere, that transmits anything to the cloud to be stored, and can be had for $20. The idea that this kind of privacy depriving device would be not just legal but flourish to the point that they are everywhere strain belief. From there it only gets crazier. The Circle tries to butt its way into federal and then world politics. Employees talk as if they know what is best for the whole world.Mae's decision making is also in question. She starts the movie questioning whether things are as perfect as they seem, but by halfway through the movie turns herself into a Truman Show by wearing a camera at all times. These decisions don't make sense with who we're supposed to believe she is, or other less trusting decisions she makes through the movie.The ending itself is full of hypocrisy. Without totally ruining it, the ending basically says well, yeah, it's bad. But is it really?",The Circle

The acting by Emma Watson was.. confusing to say the least, and the repercussions of the fictional technology seemed unrealistic and just plain ridiculous. Sure Hanks, Boyega, Oswalt, Headly, and Paxton did a decent job acting, but that was all that really helped add any meat to this dead elephant of a film. The attention to detail in some scenes, and set design was something I found pretty enjoyable, but when you pay more attention to the world of the film more than the story of the film you know the writing behind this movie has failed.. and failed hard. In the end I decided to give The Circle a ""Bad"" on theVade Review Bar or a 3 out of 10. I really wish this would have been a good movie.

159,tlooknbill,Most interesting story concept to come along in a long while.,10,11 May 2017,"Don't know why reviews are comparing this to the somewhat dark and hopeless ""1984"". ""The Circle"" is far more interestingly worse because it's deceptively wrapped up in a much more prettier, upbeat and smarter package.My overall summation sees ""The Circle"" more like the Truman Show where it begs the question how much of one's private life would one give up for complete organized convenience and social transparency? Inclusion by intrusion.You have no friends because you're a nobody? Become a somebody by having the world know your every move with all that data stored hidden away underground on mindless servers.Only problem is you have to live your life keeping everyone updated through all devices, sort of a new kind of prison.Disturbingly topical since that's what most of us are doing now with Facebook, Instagram and other social network sites except our addiction blinds us to seeing it as a prison and our data owned by someone that can't be controlled.It's the smartest written theatrical release movie in the past 20 years.",The Circle
160,razvan-rogoz,Enjoyable but apply some critical thinking first,7,28 May 2017,"Honestly, I felt like this movie makes fun of start-ups and of big data, analytics in general.I know what big data is. I use big data. I know what the quantified self movement is and how it works. I know how Facebook captures data from each user and sells it to advertisers and I must say that this movie dramatizes this dramatically. It is the kind of movie that prays on uninformed audiences by taking something they are familiar with (take social media), throwing some concepts that they may know about (analytics) and then making it look like analytics are the equivalent of a nuclear weapon.I found that  sad. It is not that the world will not head there, it will, but anyone who actually worked in this field will roll his eyes. This movie is about as accurate about how web start-ups work and how information is collected as Rambo is about the Vietnam war. It is based on some truth but it is more the type you'd read into a tabloid newspaper than on Tech Crunch.And personally, I simply hate it when this happens - when something is taken and then dramatized in almost an obscene manner just to evoke an emotional reaction from the audience. It reminds me of the Cold War and how everything was portrayed as a caricature of good and evil, capitalism vs communism, smarts vs muscle and so on. That being said, the movie itself was not that bad. Watson is a great actress and she carries her role well. Tom Hanks's role is a bit exaggerated and that sucks. Everyone else falls somewhere in between. This is the strange part, Watson actually portrays a living, 3D, believable character while the others fall into some stereotype or another. It is like the script writer finished the main character and then got bored and decided to go for 2D characters instead.The ending is anti-climatic as hell and while it is supposed to provide some form of poetic justice, it falls flat. ""HOW"" is the big question as while it has some basis in the plot, it feels a huge lot like a deus ex machina, like a last minute plot device used to turn things right and make the audience feel warm and fuzzy. If they would have cut the movie 15 minutes later, I swear, it would have deserved an Oscar for the bleak end but by ending it as they did  for me, they've made a movie that required suspension of disbelief become what that is  not believable. Period. So feel free to check it out but keep in mind that while everything said there is true, in reality, we're about 25 - 30 years away from even having the capacity to do this, not to mention use it. This is not a documentary, it is a cash grab designed to capitalize on our fear of losing our privacy in the Internet of things world.",The Circle
161,d_carlotaj,Shades of Go Ogle!,10,5 July 2020,"""The Circle,"" (2017 ). Starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. Directed by James Ponsoldt. Written by James Ponsoldt and Dave Eggars. This is a special effects movie about the effects of rampant social media intrusion. The setting is the near future. Almost immediately, one conjours up a mental image of Bill Gates and his major, global conglomerate, Go Ogle! Where a symbiosis of Big Brother (CIA), Big Business, and the Big Bad Guys (Mafia) form a unified Watcher's Association, whose logo could well be 👀!
The CIA would be able to find anyone by tracing people who ogle a particular target. Big business ogles targets whose interests might be profitable to them. Ah! And the Mafia could ogle people for black mail purposes or for mining unremunerated creativity. A whole host of potential monetary projects could loom large. Needless to say, things could go South for everyone. And I say that it starts with computer safety and cell phone intrusion. Oh, and let's not forget...home surveillance.

163,ReelLifeReviews,Poor directing,3,2 May 2017,"The Circle - A 2 hour movie that you'll swear took 4 hours of your night. This aimless smattering of scenes accidentally stumbles upon compelling subject matter once or twice, but regains it's focus to continue it's journey on the bridge to nowhere.Emma Watson is the protagonist, or at the very least the person that takes us along on this chore of a story. With the driving force of the movie being full access and unfiltered knowledge of everyone, her character is incredibly detached from the audience. Motivations go completely out the window for her multiple times, leaving the audience scratching their heads. And I honestly have never seen an actor be so bored in a role they were playing. I'd say she mailed in her performance, but even that would require effort.In a gesture of solidarity, her costars agreed to also sleepwalk through the film. Ellar Coltrane, who plays Mercer, is Watson's white knight by taking the burden of worst actor upon himself. Patton Oswalt, who is horribly miscast as the company's COO, seemed out of his element in each scene he was a part of. I can only assume he was the studio's 3rd or 4th choice for the role. The small bright spots for me were Karen Gillan, who plays Watson's insider friend. Her initial introduction was a little jarring, but she was by far the strongest performer. Bill Paxton did well with what he was given, and it was just good to see him again, even if it was in something like this.Telling you to skip this movie is unnecessary, but I would point you in the direction of the Netflix series Black Mirror. The episode 'Nosedive' is everything this movie wished it could be. I wish the producers would have watched that episode before making this film. Not so they could have made it better, but so they wouldn't have bothered. 3/10",The Circle

I can't recall ever seeing a movie where every scene and dialogue is so forced and unrealistic.The Circle is clearly an attempt to mock Google and ask questions asked 1 million times before about how the company (""The Circle"") can become all powerful with eyes everywhere and info about everything because it's all connected. Except this applies to Facebook and plenty of other technology. It's not a new issue. But these characters mostly act like a bunch of dumb idiots and, the super smart ones who are supposed to have people skills, have none. They telegraph issues 50 miles away. For example, I knew the movie was going to be a dud when our heroine just begins and the pair of social bunnies for the circle rattle off how she should participate more, etc. and then begin to mention things casually about her family that they shouldn't know. I mean like OMG!!!! How freaking weird!!!! Like.... OMG... this is like big brother!!!! This movie was written for people with a 2 digit IQ or for children under the age of 10. Perhaps they might need explanation about a world they don't yet fully understand and appreciate. But anyone high school or older will laugh at this comedy.Every scene desperately tries to hit the viewer over the head with its point. And in case you missed it, they make sure to smack you over the head with yet more over the top behavior just to make sure you got the heavy question and moral issue they intend to raise!

167,duvernetphotography,The Full Will,6,12 August 2017,"Great acting. Emma is great. She's youthful, spunky, smart and so normal. Tom Hanks is so suave and natural in these smarty roles. The concept of The Circle is that transparency = truth. It is an interesting concept that all this information and being totally connected is a good thing. That this is uniting, accountable and democratic. The movie attempts to take the concept to the extreme to show us how technology can be as much our enemy as friend. This movie is a statement that needs to be made. Mae gets taken up in the excitement of a hi-tech company that collects information and professes that we should know everything about everyone. She is encouraged to go full exposure wearing cameras everywhere. While this ""connects"" her with ""friends"" around the world, the soul search service takes it too far and kills her friend. She decides to turn the tables on the executive by playing public sentiment for their transparency. She proves that not everyone plays equally at the information game.

Starring Tom Hanks as hairy Steve Jobs, Emma Watson as the easily confused girl, Patton Oswalt as the (literal) heavy, and John Boyega as Steve ""I was just trying to make Tinder!""

Just when the film is gearing up to actually become something, it ends... sloppily, I might add.On paper, this had the makings of something intelligent and workmanlike.

It stars Emma Watson who is fresh off a great performance in ""Beauty And The Beast,"" so I was excited to see if they would jump-start her acting career again. Luckily this movie is getting a wider release than some of her other films that have flown under the radar between Harry Potter and Beauty And The Beast, so maybe directors will get a chance to look at her realize her potential right? I'll come back to her in a minute.""The Circle"" is a good idea. It is a relevant topic for the society that we live in today. We are so immersed in this technology-based world now where we ourselves even wonder about some of the scenarios the film portrays, and that's the biggest praise I can give this film. Other than that, this film is a sloppy mess full of dull characters, really bad dialogue, and poor acting. Other than those flaws, there is one core problem with this movie. This movie tries so hard to raise questions for the viewer, which it does, but never reaches the heights necessary to answer these questions. I fully understood the movie. It's just that the central theme of this movie (whether or not we are secretly being watched, if we need to know the difference between public and private) never hammers these thoughts into your brain the way it should. There is a subplot that is introduced in this movie, and it goes nowhere. It was almost like the movie was on cruise control but sped past the exit you needed to get off at. That whole subplot is just brushed under the rug and forgotten about. The acting is really bad in the movie. Emma Watson is fine, though I am still waiting for her to give us that Oscar worthy performance that I know she's capable of. I will say that I thought her performance improved as the movie went on, but there were times at the beginning when i thought her performance was a little wooden. John Boyega is good in the three scenes he is in. That's right, three scenes. He only gets three scenes to shine. To me this is just a filler movie for him to keep busy in between ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi,"" but I wanted to see more of him. Karen Gillan annoyed the hell out of me in ""Guardians Of The Galaxy,"" she annoyed the hell out of me in this, and rumor has it, she's annoying in ""Gaudrians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2."" So yeah my tolerance level with her is gone. The rest of the supporting cast is awful. There's this character named Mercer and the actor that plays him looks like he never acted a day in his life. Then when Tom Hanks is on screen you look at him and think to yourself ""oh, so this is what acting is like.""The characters in this film are literally some of the dumbest characters I have ever seen. The main character Mae is hollow. There's nothing to her. She has no arc whatsoever. I just don't buy the fact that a girl with her intellect would just walk into this big conglomerate, look around, and think everything is going to be okay. No, just no. Put it this way. If Google and Facebook had a kid and that kid took a bunch of anabolic steroids... that's the company The Circle. If I walked into that place the moment I walked in I would think ""well this place looks super shady. Peace out homies!"" Her character rises to the top of the ladder in the company so quick you wonder how she got there. They don't show it, so how did it happen. John Boyega's character had nothing to him, he went nowhere, I didn't care. Tom Hanks, you knew he was gonna be this shady villain but hide it for the majority of the movie, and that's exactly what happened. This movie played out the way I expected it to. Woman gets a job at a tech company. She enjoys her time, she rises to the top, finds out they're shady and exposes them. This movie is predictable, the acting is awful save for Watson, Boyega, and Hanks. The writing is all over the place. There's no characters, and the characters that we get have little to no development. Subplots are introduced and those end up going nowhere.

Emma Watson plays a rigid, naive character which made liking her, difficult. On this note, her co-star Eller Coltrane's acting was dull, their relationship of any sort was lacking and generally speaking the whole film could have done without it.

For those who are socially more important (more followers)I guess it can be equally or even worse since everyone gets to comment, misread and sometimes disagree in extreme ways and assault you with words. Resuming you either post it and it happened but you submit yourself to the judgment of the world with possibility of being extremely ""punished"" or you don't even exist for everyone. It can become overwhelming and it's not hard to notice this since so many singers/actors are actually quitting social life because for them it's easier to be caught in this web. So The Circle brings attention to this subject and for that it's important. Of course the story and it's treatment could be much better so it get's to be only average.. I guess I would recommend it for a lazy Sunday when you don't know what to watch...There are no surprises in here, not very interesting lines and I personally didn't buy Mae's character but still interesting to picture some things of the real world on it and image if couldn't it happen in the future (meaning the political side of the story).",The Circle
189,javan23,Perfect tone,7,24 April 2019,"Tom Hanks plays the role perfectly. A goofy, dorky but kinda cool and charismatic ""visionary"" leading us all willingly into the dystopian future. The devil doesn't look like the devil. We sell ourselves out for convenience, because it's easy, because everyone else does. This isn't an amazing movie by any means, but I thought the chosen tone was great.

On paper, this film ticks all the right boxes: topical sci-fi, great actors in fitting roles, plot ingredients that should create great suspense...and yet, it completely fails to deliver at all levels.I wanted to like this film, so I ignored the first few warning signs: the characters start off a bit one-dimensional, a slightly uninspired representation of Google/Facebook/Amazon-ehm I mean-""The Circle's"" headquarters...But then came a couple of scenes that could (no exaggeration) be right out of a CollegeHumor parody video - except they were meant to be serious- and I knew something had gone really wrong with the script and direction.15-20 minutes into the film everything becomes completely predictable. There isn't a single moment that has you on edge or wondering what's coming next, because everything is as blatant and simplistic as it could be. There's nothing novel about any of the characters or the major plot points. What is worse, the script just can't stop preaching:""losing all our privacy is bad...mmkay?"" ""big corporations shouldn't spy on us all the time...mmkay?"" ""sacrificing your personal life in the name of a morally dubious career can have regrettable repercussions...mmkay?"" -NO SH!T movie!

191,rs403404,"It's Like The Social Network, but Crappy.",4,11 May 2017,"The Circle is a company that appears to be Facebook on steroids; a company focused not just on social connections, but also on information storage. Thus the film, ""The Circle"", delves into the concept that as technology develops our personal privacy disintegrates. Point in fact, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks) seems to be a true believer in the idea that the world would be better if secrets didn't exist. He makes a convincing case; after all people are less likely to commit crimes if their being watched. Therefore, shouldn't we always be watched? ""The Circle"" is at it's strongest when tackling this issue. Unfortunately, it does so by sacrificing characters, subplots, and any other adjacent themes.All the actors are solid here. Hanks delivers overwhelming credibility to a character that on paper reads like a super-villain. The remaining cast (including the late Bill Paxton) brings their utmost to this film, which is necessary since the script literally treats these characters as props for the greater moral of the movie. For instance, John Boyega's Ty Lafitte, ostensibly the Doctor Frankenstein of this piece (deprived of the soul-wrenching recognition that creation does not equal humanity), appears and disappears whenever the script needs him to do so (including but not limited to a nice piece of deus ex machina).That brings us to the ending, no spoilers, but even if I did say something it wouldn't matter because the resolution just happens--no buildup, no backstory. ""The Circle"" frantically warn us about a future wherein huge corporate entities easily employ data mining, meanwhile failing to indict the system that allows these same corporations to wield such power. Within the context of the film, The Circle unabashedly describes how it will use its website to takeover government responsibilities for nuisances like voter registration and voting in general. However, never a peep is heard about how a corporation could exercise such power over government functions. How does this a dystopian turn-of-events occur? Is it through bribery? blackmail? The movie creates a gaping hole then fails to fill it.""The Circle"" is a film bubbling with interesting ideas and ethical implications, but sadly, by disregarding the characters and the story, neglects to explore them properly.",The Circle
192,rdbrown-zeteo,Not what you think... but is that so bad?,7,29 April 2017,"The Circle is one of those movies that once the general audience has time for their minds to wrap around the concept of this movie, then it has a chance at higher ratings and better reviews. It was not want I expected, and yet I left with the sense that I could engage in a three hour philosophical discussion about the movie. It lacks your typical ""antagonist"" or rather, the ""antagonist"" is not what you thought or would expect in a typical thriller. And the antagonist may not be so much of a person as it is a concept or idea that goes too far or in the wrong direction but is not in and of itself bad.The conclusion of the film did not resolve how I would have predicted having seen the trailers. But, I won't go there so as not to spoil the movie. You may be hesitant to see this movie, and you may not like it after having seen the movie - but none-the-less, it is still worth seeing and hopefully *maybe* you will leave the theatre thinking if you are that type of person. Its like going to an art show. I, as an amateur, would go hoping to be ""wowed"" by the typical entertaining pieces - the ones that make sense to me. However, I can easily over look a masterpiece because I do not take the time and focus to look deeper and past the non-traditional. All that being said, the acting was a little strange, which makes some of the interactions awkward. But in hindsight, it kind of makes sense because the ""circle"" is all about community and engaging with your community. And, so some of the social interactions can be ""odd"". So if I compare it to the basic formula and standard quality of movie entertainment that money pushes out there, I could easily overlook a possible deeper element. Or maybe I'm just being ridiculous and looking too deep into this movie. There were some intense moments. But, not so much of what you would think of in a thriller. This is not a cat-and-mouse dystopian type thriller where your life is at stake. So, maybe you would like it - like I did. Maybe you won't. Maybe it will take a while for the concept of this movie to catch up to everyone who didn't feel entertained. Either way, worth a shot.",The Circle

As we follow the main character we wonder where her mind is, does she disagree at any point? It seemed that was what we were to assume.

Tom Hanks is horribly past his prime and his skills have subsided markedly. He didn't bring anything to the screen other than a campy over the top vision of what he thought steve jobs acted like when he was alive and a maniacal tyrant. The girl who was cute as Hermione is no longer cute and also acted in such a campy, this is how I think a high school girl with a crush on her teacher acts manner that it made the movie just creep along at a snails pace.

You ruined a bad movie by adding a wonderful actress to it.The Circle is no more than an expensive student film made by mediocre students, a social commentary that is not original at all, and a piece of writing that cannot be dignified as literature. I pity all the CGIs, money and time spent in it. It's giving voice to an idea that has already been heard widely, letting it fester and stink of cliché.First of all, I wouldn't call it dystopia, because it is not believable enough to be daunting. The alarmists might scream: ""This is already happening! This is what the future has in store for us!"" If that is the sentiment this film tries to convey then the first episode of the third season of Black Mirror does a so much better job. I am not judging which theory is closer to the future. In this movie the crowd seems utterly numb and devoid of humanity. When (Bailey) Tom Hanks goes on stage and talk about sticking surveillance camera in the tree, you would expect even the most unthinking crowd to bring up the privacy cliché, not to mention an elite company filled with intellectuals. When the female criminal Fiona is hunted like a trapped deer and pressed to the wall by a muscular police to form an image that almost look like rape, you would expect the audience to be sympathetic. But all they do is freaking clap and cheer. They are utterly unconvincing. The production team is doing their best to look down upon human society/collective intelligence, and drag it to the same level of a barely high school graduate sitting in his parents' garage, writing some nonsense and fantasizing about being famous for it.Except for that, I accuse this film of ethnic back-dropping. Ty is a good Morpheus character. He is black, he is mysterious, and he is a good computer person. Good, so far they've managed to copy from Matrix, Hunger Game, Now You See Me and a thousand other popular movies. But then his existence is completely forgotten, he has nothing to do with the development of the plot, except to show how wrong Mae is. Although Mae ignored his advice completely and fought for total transparency, which is opposite of Ty's, there is no process of reconciliation. He just jumped back to being Mae's best friend. Why, because he's black, he isn't entitled to feel betrayed by someone whom he is brave enough to open up to, but turns to serve something he is totally afraid of? Smith Cho and Ellen Wong's are the only two Asian characters, their both blindly following the system and managing to appear despicable in the process. This bit of contrivance disgusts me more than you can imagine. If you ask me how much implicit racism this film includes I would say it's the percentage of all the votes here I am not giving it.The CGI is perfect, the shots are slightly above Hollywood standard, which only make me more confused why such a film bothers to be made.

Since most of the cast are playing mindless characters that lack any depth, including the Mae for the most part, the only 2 characters I cared more to further understand were Bonnie and Ty, as they were the only characters along with the parents that seemed to understand what was going on. We are given the impression that Ty had some sort of plan to fight back against the circle which was never fully realised, and what we get is an ending that falls very flat.

It's ""1984"" meets the ""The Truman Show,"" set in Silicon Valley, and wants to serve as a cautionary tale about personal privacy. Given what we all know about the NSA, Big Data, Snowden and WikiLeaks, however, it's too-little, too late. Or, as one critic noted, it's ""ripped from yesterday's headlines!""The premise is that Emma Watson goes to work for the ""Circle"" (Facebook / Google) headed by Tom Hanks (Steve Jobs) and Patton Oswalt (Steve Wozniak) in their huge Silicon Valley office complex (Apple.) Besides – literally - wanting to take over the world, Hanks and Oswalt have developed an ideology based on ""Secrets are lies, sharing is caring, privacy is theft."" The solution is to have surveillance cameras everywhere, including those worn as universal personal body-cams.Watson plays a new employee (""guppy"" in Circle-talk) who becomes the first person so equipped. As with the Truman Show, the world becomes addicted to following Watson's life. (Somewhat inexplicably, given that she works 80-hour weeks and has no social life.) At the same time, The Circle is convincing governments around the world to adopt its platform to enforce mandatory citizen-engagement, voting, etc.The movie half-heartedly and perfunctorily explores some of the privacy issues, and finally, Watson begins to see the downside to all of this and ultimately rebels.Watson (who has top-billing over Tom Hanks) once again delivers an uninspired performance. (The film had major re-shoots to make Watson's character more appealing, but the re-shoots tested worse than the original scenes.) Hanks and Patton Oswalt are interesting choices as the protagonists, while Glenne Headly and Bill Paxton play her increasingly concerned parents. Karen Gillan – who seems to get better with each performance -- plays Watson's friend, who's also part of the Circle's uh, inner-circle.The producers accurately recreate the cult-like atmosphere of big Silicon Valley companies, but don't seem to understand the underlying technology. Silicon Valley tech companies, for example, don't build data centers in abandoned subway tunnels, especially ones with water dripping off the walls and with giant puddles on the floor; people can't bring random and unannounced visitors into data centers; and data storage has progressed to where rack after rack of servers are no needed to store one person's personal data.While most movies today are shot in Georgia, Louisiana or overseas, The Circle proclaims in the closing credits that is was filmed entirely on location in California on in California studios.Skip this one.",The Circle

But not the happy, happy ending where despite Pandora's Box being opened, all the problems disappeared merely by removing JUST TWO (apparently that's all it took) central plotters!It was the shallow portrayal of the plotters that was the biggest weakness, although the heroine wasn't given much to do either.

221,LawLess39,Lousy movie - good point though,5,4 August 2017,"I gave it a 5 for content ... certainly not the cast/acting. Are *Millennial's* and *Snow Flakes* that dull-witted? Hard to believe, but still ... I can see this happening. Bunch of lemmings being lead around by the nose ... by their *smart* phones? Well ... looks like it could be.Mob rule directed by social media? Yeah ... flash mobs are becoming the norm and are being used for violent purposes, at times. So sure this could be a plausible direction ... outcome ... of the mindless following the heard instinct. Not a pretty picture.As far as the movie goes? Even Tom Hanks couldn't save this stinker. The cast (or 'The Circle') Was, mostly, the same age group (20's) no children or older (adults) people. They're all frail, spindly, pasty, pail and undernourished looking. They all appear, to be rather imbecilic throughout the movie.There is a hint of an undercurrent plot (data mining), with some mysterious dude that takes little susie cream cheese into an under ground tunnel. But this never goes anywhere.In the end Mae (Emma Watson) turns out to be a NAZI/Borg princess. Of all the cast, she looks the worst of the lot. Can't act and has the personality of a toad stool.This movie must have been made for a specific age group. Other than the *1984* theme ... there wasn't much to this movie.

222,MeMyselfAndTheBeard,The acting let it down,6,19 November 2017,"I'm sorry but it was just the acting that let this film down for me.I know there acting pretending to be someone else but it showed felt fake like. Emma Watson beautiful woman but i just didn't believe her it was like someone's social media post its all fake pretending to be someone else when there not and you can see straight through it. It was like she was trying too hard. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks always puts in a good performance he was the best thing about this film. John Boyega looked he was trying too hard as well perhaps it's trying to put on an American accent thats stoping them putting in a solid performance or maybe there holding back because it's just on Netflix and not in the cinemas. Cellar Coltrane another bit of acting which seemed wooden which is a shame after what he did in Boyhood.Glenne Headly and the late Bill Paxton did a good job with the MS story especially Bill his face when he realised he soiled himself was spot on I do the exact same thing well not from soiling myself but when I realise there's something wrong with me like that sinking feeling.Karen Gillian another beautiful woman again I just didn't understand, she's either a really really good actor or she just didn't care about giving a 100% seemed it at first when she first entered the film but then I don't know just didn't believe her. The story though I was thinking as the film was going on I bet it's not far from the future. Some of it I was like yes id be up for catching criminals, stopping people getting in danger that needs to happen. Didn't agree with the thought that everyone should post everything they do all experiences, some people just want to be in the moment and u think that should be respected.

She sees it as an opportunity of a lifetime. As she rises through the ranks, she is encouraged by the company's founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), to engage in a groundbreaking experiment that pushes the boundaries of privacy, ethics and ultimately her personal freedom. Her participation in the experiment, and every decision she makes begin to affect the lives and future of her friends, family and that of humanity. One of The Circle's other founders, Ty (John Boyega) is unhappy with the direction the company is taking and ropes in Mae to help expose the shenanigans.Director James Ponsoldt co-wrote the screenplay with Dave Eggers. The film is being marketed as a thriller. Em, it's not. This is the least suspenseful thriller since thrillers were first made. The Circle is marketed as keeping you on the edge of your seat. Well, it doesn't.Emma Watson brings youthful energy to her performance but even she doesn't break a suspenseful sweat. For the first time ever, Tom Hanks is pretty poor in a movie, just short of dialling in his performance. John Boyega is disappointing. This is Tom Hanks second time filming a Dave Eggers screenplay; last year's disappointing A Hologram for the King.Of note, among the cast is the late Bill Paxton. He plays Mae's father who suffers from MS. It is his last big screen outing and it's a shame that this is it.

230,obiegimmie,'The Circle' Review,1,15 May 2017,"THE CIRCLESTATISTICS (*NO SPOILERS*)""The Circle"" is a 2017 techno-thriller directed by James Ponsoldt (""The Spectacular Now""), and written by Ponsoldt and Dave Eggers; Eggers the author of the 2013 novel of the same name. Music is by Danny Elfman (""Desperate Housewives""); cinematography by Matthew Libatique (""Black Swan""); editing by Lisa Lassek (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" Season 6); production by Anthony Bregman, Gary Goetzman (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""), Tom Hanks, and James Ponsoldt. It primarily stars Emma Watson (""Harry Potter""); Tom Hanks (""Forrest Gump""); John Boyega (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""); Karen Gillan (""Guardians of the Galaxy""); Ellar Coltrane (""Boyhood""); Patton Oswalt (""King of Queens""); Bill Paxton (""Terminator""); Glenne Headly (""Mr. Holland's Opus""). Filming began September 17, 2015 in Pasadena, CA. (Retakes were scheduled around January 2017.) Its budget totaled around $18 million; as of today (May 10, 2017) its box office is at $16 million worldwide. It spans a total of 1 hour, 50 minutes 110 minutes total) and is grouped as PG-13. PLOT SUMMARY (*NO SPOILERS*)Mae Holland (Watson) is an unaccomplished, mediocre customer service rep, who, in hopes of bettering her life, applies for a job at the Circle (the equivalent of Google and Facebook in one). To her surprise, her friend Annie (Gillan), a Circle employee, is able to get Mae a modest yet serviceable position in customer service, and Mae is predictably ecstatic. Mae meets a mysterious person, later revealed to us as TruYou founder Ty Lafitte (Boyega). They share some terribly awkwardly paced flirtatious dialogue, and then Lafitte leaves, but not before ominously suggesting The Circle could be evil. Then Eamon Bailey (Hanks) the CEO, and his co-founder Tom Stenton (Oswalt) set Mae up for an interview in which she shares the life-saving abilities of SeeChange to her co-workers. She announces that she is now going ""fully transparent,"" or wearing a live camera on her that can be commented and monitored 24/7. So now she wears this camera all the time. Mae is so unique that she is given the required funds to launch a new program, SoulSearch. Fundamentally, SoulSearch requires the participation and involvement of people across the globe. Ideally any person can be accessed. Once his/her name is announced, everyday people will begin, worldwide, to search for said person. Mae's plan backfires when the crowd suggests searching for a normal person, someone close to her is lost and she begins to doubt The Circle. REVIEW (*SPOILERS INDICATED*)I have never read The Circle by Dave Eggers, so I am unfortunately unable to make a comparison, determining if the story was good. I am ashamed to say that $12.00 is the price I had to pay to view this film, and $12.00 was therefore wasted. But do I regret it? No. This is probably the funnest review I'm going to write all year. So let me begin with what many people consider the biggest flaw of The Circle, the characters. In that category that this film remarkably fails. I mean what do we really know about Mae? She has a dad with MS and is...kind? Witty? Smart? Dumb? Dead Inside? This is not totally Watson's fault. I know I have been all too vocal on her in Beauty and the Beast, but in this film she is genuinely trying to make Mae work. Is Emma Watson an amazing actress? No. No. But she tries. So let's direct our attentions to another big character, Eamon Bailey. There is nothing giving us evidence that Bailey is evil. No qualities that we can assign to him besides ""mysterious"" and ""controlling"". Heck, that could be Edward from Twilight for all I know. And this brings me to Ty Lafitte, a severe misuse of what could have been great. Again, this is not a fault of Boyega, but rather the writing and pacing of the film. In the entirety, Lafitte appears in about four scenes and is mentioned in two. I can't really make a legitimate criticism because we know virtually nothing about Lafitte except that. Yes, the writing, the screenplay is to blame because it does not take time to build on the characters, to establish valid connections between the audience and actor. So let's focus on another aspect; the plot. The plot is filled with holes and calamities that I am still baffled about. Let's list them here: (*SPOILERS BELOW*)1. Why did Annie leave The Circle? 2. Why did Ty share that information (""The Circle is bad."") with Mae when she could have easily gotten him fired? 3. Why does no-one recognize Ty even though he was some big shot Circle founder?4. Why give Ty free reign of the place without suspecting he's riling up a Circle employee (Mae) with anti-technology propaganda?? Hasn't something like this happened before? 5. What exactly is on all of Bailey's files that Mae exposed? What makes them incriminating? 6. What was the real point of hiring Karen Gillan, Patton Oswalt, and John Boyega in the movie if they do so little? 7. After exposing Bailey, what happened? Is Mae the head of the Circle? Is the Circle still existent? Why did Mae appear happy to see the drones monitoring her when her philosophy after Mercer's death was ""Monitoring everything is bad,""?It is a beautiful film, with sleek editing and graphics that are impressive and demand attention, if nothing else. 1/1010%F-",The Circle

232,dizzieparttwo,Painful to watch....,2,18 June 2018,I forced myself to watch entire movie. It could have been so much better....just when I thought it would go one way it went 180 the other direction. Not sure what message this film was trying to get across...the dangers of social media....dangers of mob rule....dangers of not researching a possible employer...so yes current real events surrounding Facebook etc should open up people's eyes about social media and how being constantly connected to the net is not really a good thing.

233,MauritiusVonMailand,It make you think about what you should already know,5,13 September 2019,"First of all, watch this movie together with ""Searching"" (2018), whose plot is (wanted to be) the celebration of the immense potential of Google engine, good enough for doing everything you need w/o leaving a room, searches for your missing daughter included (the idea of ""no need to leave your house anymore"" scared me much more than The Circle, because to me this is not a potential but a nightmare, unless you are constrained in a bed).The film has puzzled me because while I do understand its goal, it failed in making the problem look real, at least to the vast majority of compulsive social users. He wanted to be a kind of ""j'accuse"" against facebook (no hypocrisy please, the movie is about Facebook and Zuckerberg and, as someone said, Steve Jobs, whose focus was tech and money and not data collection) and its desire to plunder data from users too happy to share everything. My fear is that the average ""social media -addicted user"" would think ""cool, I'd love to be online h24 and participate in a man-hunt"".
Mae's character does not arouse empathy and Emma Watson's pose (it made me think of Hugh Grant) was somehow dull.
Tom Hanks is a perfect synopsis of Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg. Maybe too much. I believe that the vast majority of the young people who saw the film did not perceive the message, just ""the usual exaggeration of people resilient to internet"". Pushing too much on drama, made the message weaker because most people would think ""ok, it is a movie. BTW, take a pict of the funny fat guy seated in front of us eating meat"".
Last but not least if you want to deliver a ""message"" you must be sure of being credible and not just another case of brain washing. Let's talk about Ty Lafitte. The only positive character ... is ""coloured"". Quite strange that while I cannot remember in the movie Indians or Pakistans, Chinese or Russian (people usually associated, because it is real, with Geek roles) the producers decided that the Geek (and somehow a hero) was supposed to be afro-american.
When a movie whose goal is to denounce the intrusiveness of internet and social media, the hypocrisy of the single thought, and the ""social driven democracy"", ... appears to be totally flat with the recent Hollywood agenda whose claim is ""no Afro-American has to be cast as a bad guy, it should always appear as a positive character, better if it is the only one "", then credibility goes to hell.",The Circle

It manufactures a crisis in Act II that is completely unrealistic simply because corporations don't risk having demos blow up in their faces by welcoming in uncontrollable variables and then refuses to accept the natural consequences (including for the corporation) of this colossal FU. And Emma Watson's Girl Friday character can't have a genuine change of heart because then she can't keep her 20 million followers. So, hey, folks, let's just end privacy altogether! That'll fix it, right? There's no logic to this at all, unless you think friendship means being able to stalk people you know 24/7 with or without their permission. How someone of Eggers talent could help construct such a shallow and foolish story is beyond me. I haven't read the book.

There were a few moments in the film that I reflected on afterwards that did what the film was attempting to do, and that's spark an important conversation about technology and human rights. But that's the problem; there were only a few moments like that. Whenever it tried to get deep, the acting and over the top nature of the film muddied what little quality was there, and since the film was nearly 2 hours, they had to shove in all these useless characters that offered nothing special to the story. They never made any real impact, except maybe the dead character, but other than that, they just made the film EXCRUCIATINGLY long. It would've made a fantastic short film if they had just cut out all the useless characters, and kept Emma, the dead character, and Tom Hank's character.

There are two arguments though that I would like to contradict myself on that: first, obviously, even the mighty Hanks can be part of a nonsense like this, second, there is one scene, at the end, with Emma starring at the drones and greeting them, where she displays precisely the part she should have acted after the change in her conviction: seemingly naive but with all the knowledge she had acquired in the meantime.

246,yelofneb-63037,A movie that makes you go hmmm.,4,10 July 2017,"***may contain spoilers but absolutely no gluten or lactose.A movie that makes you go hmmm.Emma Watson is known not only for her acting career but also for standing up for issues that she feels deserve attention. Unfortunately, the issues of her concern apparently do not extend to human rights violations by the major investor, the government of Abu Dhabi, in her latest movie, The Circle.Given that the subject of the movie deals with a very complicated issue in the history of civil rights in the more enlightened parts of the world, namely privacy, the choice of that investor seems almost cynical. In fact, it seems suspiciously part of an ongoing campaign in recent times by many to whitewash Abu Dhabi's reputation.The Circle is a bit of a mess, as far as any sensible narrative is concerned. The idea that the movie was forced onto the market prior to proper editing is supported by the fact that Tom Hanks also takes part in what amounts to a glib and ultimately ridiculous treatment of the serious issue of privacy rights in the tech age.Whether or not one is a fan of Tom Hanks, the thing that one could feel assured of on seeing his name in the credits of any movie was that a certain high standard of quality could be expected of the article delivered--and that kind of standard matters, in a world where hype has ever more might over quality.Even the most cursory glance on IMDb of Hank's career reveals a solid testimony of a dedicated professional acting talent--and this is precisely why one suspects that there must have been a huge miscalculation involved in the too early unedited release of The Circle. While I could not expect an Oscar standard performance from Emma Watson, I still expected more of Tom Hanks. After all, it's not as though he's just working for the money--hopefully--at this point in a long career. Hmmm.Maybe there's a director's cut hidden in the basement waiting on a time when the lawyers of a famous Silicon Valley search engine enterprise have lost their teeth. If not, then The Circle will only be famous for being Tom Hanks' worst movie, given his lukewarm presence--a rare event in his career--in a role that begs for a strong performance.Director James Ponsoldt's previous work includes The Spectacular Now, a difficult but narratively balanced eventually-coming-of-age story, and Smashed, also a story about alcoholism that received excellent references from recovering alcoholics, as well as being a selection at the Sundance Film Festival of 2012. Based on the rendered quality of those two movies alone, the suspicion of a forced early release of The Circle looms even larger.The thing that bothers me most about The Circle is the weak narrative, but there's also the fact that I still haven't yet seen an Emma Watson role that left any lasting impression on me. In fact, if it hadn't been for the names of Ponsoldt and Hanks, I wouldn't have given time to the hope that Emma might shine--as she could have, being in the company of two such solidly proved accomplished movie artists.The Circle remains nonetheless worth watching, because the issue of privacy invasion certainly deserves serious public consideration, and if it helps younger viewers to consider the privacy effect of greater connectivity, then the viewers' time is well spent--as long as one manages to see beyond the investor's lack of regard for the same back home in Abu Dhabi.",The Circle
247,12_Monkeys,"Hollywood, please, give real screenwriters a chance!",3,14 August 2017,"One would think that a top notch producer-duo like Anthony Bregman and Gary Goetzman, an amazing cinematographer like Matthew Libatique, an unbelievable composer like Danny Elfman, two talented editors like Lisa Lassek and Franklin Peterson, and incredible actors like Tom Hanks and Emma Watson would guarantee a great film, right? -- Wrong... this is why the screenplay is so important. To be completely fair, I haven't read David Eggers' novel, so I don't know if it's good or not, but if we base that judgement on the film, it sure as hell doesn't seem like it.Why is the script so poorly written? The first big problem is that we don't know our protagonist's intent or obstacle. We have no idea what she wants, what she's doing to get it, or what stands in her way. This is at the top of every screen writing seminar, course, book, or principle list that you can find. If this is not clear within the first 10 to 12 pages of your script, then don't even bother filming it.We do know that she dislikes her job and that she has a sick father whom she loves. But she's not doing anything to help her dad, and she's not looking for a different job either. She does go kayaking though, so... good for her! The job offer (inciting incident) that gets her to embark onto a promised adventure, comes in a phone call from a friend. A phone call that takes our protagonist by surprise. So, to make matters even worse, our main character is completely reactive. Things happen to her, she doesn't make them happen, which makes her dull and boring -- Something one would think could be a big decision-changer for actors like Emma Watson to accept a role in a film at this point of her career. But hey, maybe not! Our protagonist agrees to the interview (a very weird one that includes picking between her favorite Beatle and reacting to an inappropriate invitation to go out with her interviewer) and she gets the job! And now we embark onto the adventure.At first, everything is very expository. Tom Hanks' character is introduced as a quite literal Steve Jobs-like company manager, who believes in technology's power to help us know everything about everyone in the world, basically. Then, an opportunity to help her father reveals to our protagonist by, again, the same friend who offered her the interview in the first place. So, our protagonist is yet again reacting to what is happening to her.To make matters worse, what pushes her (very late so) to make her first big decision, is that she inadvertently decides to take a kayaking trip in the middle of the night, and go sailing onto the darkness with no life-vest (or even a flashlight for that matter), for a ridiculous nocturnal, meditative promenade (because, you know, YOLO). This really bizarre, nonsensical decision is what propels her to take action with Tom Hanks' character and take an active part of the all-time-surveilling-technology of the Circle. Then the story turns into a modern era ""Truman Show"" without the innovative factor of reality television, and with an improbable audience who is all-love-and-no-hate for our always innocent Mae Holland. (Seriously, this Utopia world presents no haters in the social media.) The technology gets so big, they challenge themselves to find any person in the world, with the help of their hundreds of millions of subscribers. The first person they challenge their users to find is an outlaw murderer woman. She is found within 10 minutes, and guess what? These hundreds of millions of users find her without a shred of mistakes. No one mistakes another woman for her, there are no complications, and her capture is done by a police officer with calm and accuracy. Let us just say that plausibility is not this film's strongest suit.The next person they challenge their users to find is an ordinary person who's not a part of the Circle's network, and who's a former friend of our protagonist. What happens next is simply too stupid to face, because people actually chase for this guy down a highway in the mountains and get him killed in live-feed broadcasting. And what's even worse: there are no consequences to his death. Instead, what happens is that Mae finally ""opens her eyes"" to the fact that what the Circle is doing is wrong (duh!) and that violating people's privacy could get them killed (oops!). And so, she designs a trap to expose the people behind the Circle and their true intentions (evil laugh). And guess what? SHE DOES IT!

And do you know what they were hiding? -- Neither do I, because the screenwriter forgot to tell us, I guess... Or maybe he did write it but the editor cut that part out... or maybe the director forgot to film that part... or maybe it's not even in the original novel... who knows?

Initially, you savor it, enjoy the taste till trickles down and becomes a part of your blood stream. No doubt, it has unfortunately become a part of our daily life. Initially, it was voluntary. You had the option to register yourself or live the world in your way. But when the tech companies realised its addiction, your consent no longer matters. That's what this movie is all about. Though, it is not that dramatic as many hoped to be but it is nice in its own way. It is more like a documentary or monologue. Whatever it is, but it is definitely an eye opener. It teaches us to set the boundaries for sharing our information and to take control of our privacy. It is still time, get out if this matrix and breathe free air.

252,mabdulrahim,Avoid this one,4,30 April 2017,After a very long time I would say that Tom Hanks has chosen a worst script. He was very good at selecting the scripts of his movies recently and looks like he thought this would be a good one but the end result was not what he must have expected. I would say it was not what i had expected from him. This story had the potential to be a super good thriller on how the internet is trying to invade our privacy and how it could be disastrous if not used in the right way but nothing imperatively comes out of the movie. I would suggest to avoid this movie in theaters and wait for it to come in one of those online streaming sites like Netflix and you could give it a try since you are not going to pay anything extra for the movie.,The Circle

Don't get bound up in the shortcomings of the plot or the minimalism, to be kind, of the script.I don't really want to criticise it much, as it's quite clearly a teen's film, rated 12 and probably best aimed at 10 to 14 year olds or younger. Therefore it doesn't mean much I as an adult saying that a older child's film is not really for them and lacks in many ways. It's just something else.But, conversely, as a serious film for any age, a completely different entity, I think it really does have something for everyone in a therapeutic level: Just to see in a mode of depiction, with one degree of removal, just how the world has gotten in these digital days, and come to conclusions in a more immediate, natural way.Seriously. It really helped me, and I think the film knows that is something which ought best somehow be experienced without being put into words. A phenomenon.

255,lauravalerietaylor,Please spare yourself from this garbage!,1,28 December 2017,"Amazon Prime recommended this movie for me because I was looking for something in the way of a sci-fi psychological thriller. That'll teach me to listen to Prime recommendations. The movie started out fine; it's a brilliant (albeit done to death lately) premise: a young woman accepts a job with a tech company that focuses on making the world a more socially connected and transparent place, and gets more than she bargained for when she finds out what the agenda behind transparency is... or does she? Because I may have missed something, but the agenda that she had such a problem with was the same one she ended up supporting at the end of the movie. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I'll try to be a little more coherent about the reasons why I disliked this movie. First and foremost, there's the protagonist, Mae. I guess we're supposed to feel a twinge of sympathy for her from the very beginning, as she's shown stuck at her dead end job with a car that randomly keeps breaking down on her and poor parents, one of whom is chronically ill with MS. On paper, it sounds like a sympathetic situation. Only, Emma Watson didn't sell me on it. Just like everything else I've seen her in, her character was bland and sort of emotionless. Even during those rare moments when she was supposed to be displaying some sort of emotion, it felt forced, contrived. Mae has a good friend, Mercer, who comes to bail her out when her car breaks down. It's obvious he has feelings for her that are unrequited (not like I didn't see THAT one coming), and though her parents would love for her to make a match with him, she's just not interested in him that way. Which is probably why she was okay with seeking him out and getting him killed later in the film. (Okay, maybe that wasn't exactly how it happened, but close enough...)She goes to work for this company, and she's pretty much a nobody until she gets upset one night and decides to go steal a kayak in the middle of the night, go out by herself in the dark, and almost drown. Thanks to her new company's creepy all-seeing camera surveillance, she was saved by the coast guard and brought back in just in the nick of time. This results in the big bosses calling her in to ask her if she'd be willing to be part of a pilot program in which she would become 100% transparent - wearing a camera all the time. She agrees to this and becomes an overnight sensation, not just at the Circle, but around the whole world (even though she does absolutely nothing interesting). Cue a series of non-event events that lead up to her siccing the whole world onto a foreign fugitive and her friend Mercer, who was off the grid and didn't want to be found. No matter; the crowd at the Circle goaded her into orchestrating the hunt for him, which resulted in him driving off of a bridge and killing himself to avoid being caught on camera by a drone pursuing him. I nearly turned the movie off right then and there, because I figured it could only get worse. Instead, I powered through because I was committed. (I kind of wish I hadn't, because now I feel like I need to be committed.)So Mae takes three days off the grid to do some soul searching, weeping into the pillowcases of her childhood bed. Despite her parents' protests, she decides to go back to the Circle with the intent of taking down the head honchos. Her plan? To expose all of their information, making them completely transparent. The agenda, however, is still the same, which makes me wonder why she did it at all. It doesn't matter; at this point I'd all but given up on the movie and subsequently stopped listening. I could go on and on about the things I didn't like, but this review is long enough already. Let's just leave it at this: good idea, poorly executed. Don't waste your time. Not even for Tom Hanks.",The Circle

257,KenJoe,Making the world a safer place ????,2,6 July 2017,"Spoiler alert.I read the book that this movie is from and enjoyed it quite a bit. Full Disclosure: I agree, personally, with the belief that the internet is being used to capture and distribute too much information on our personal lives, destroying all notion of privacy. The recent actions by Congress have taken this loss of privacy a step further by scrapping the Internet Privacy Law.The problem with the movie for me is after watching it, I did not come away with the feeling that total openness was wrong, but just the opposite, the benefits outweighed the detriments. The movie seemed to prove that internet openness was a good thing, allowing killers on the loose to be captured, easily and quickly, Government back room deals to be monitored, and making voting easy and quick, allowing everyone to vote.The main negative in the movie was the death of Mercer, but even here, he was portrayed badly. Seeing on the screen one of his antler creations, it seems it was a decoration a serial killer would make. And his denial of killing to get the antlers seemed false, had to get them somewhere. So while his death was sad, the movie did not make him sympathetic at all. I was wondering as he was running away, why he simply not call the police and have those trespassers arrested, not being freaked out because a stranger appears on his property. Then, by so clearly showing how his death could be the motivation needed to make driving safer for all turned the event into a positive.Another point, earlier in the movie Mae seems upset by the idea of chips being implanted in children, but the negatives of this are never explored and, in fact, it is clearly explained why this is a good thing. What parent would not want their children to have this safety measure? Even the medical bracelet, wow, as explained in the movie, if this thing could really catch diseases early on and prevent them, sign me up.Now Annie, at the end of the movie why was she acting so weird, it seemed from the movie she was just overworked. What young executive on a fast track is not? Her finally going against the company came across as just being ungrateful.Ty, why was he so against the company? This was never clearly explored either. The movie explains that he is being paid to do whatever he wants, wherever he wants.Mae walking around with a camera on 24 hours a day is odd, but we learn later in the movie she can turn it off when she wants to, as when she went off the grid after Mercer died, so having it on was her choice, one she could change as she wanted to.Finally, the parents in the bedroom. Gross yes, but my first thought was why in the world would Mae put a camera in her parent's bedroom? What did she think people would see? That was not technology's fault but Mae making a terrible decision.I did not address that is not really a thriller at all, but an exploration of possible uses for technology. Would not little cameras around the world make everything safer? Would we not feel better knowing every police stop was recorded. That all areas outside of schools had this protection? For me, as a call to arms over the abuse of technology the movie failed and instead demonstrated how useful this technology would be. As a thriller or mystery, well there was no thrill or mystery.",The Circle
258,rdwaryer@aol.com,An odd mix,8,21 November 2020,"I'm not entirely sure what to make of The Circle. On the one hand (and for most of the film) it appears to be a warning against the increasing power of social media. So far, so good. At the end of the film the heroine, who seems to be trying to resist...hands over even more complete power, albeit to the platform, not to the people who are running it. Still, in the closing moments, she seems to think that all pervasive social media is a wonderful thing. I'm not one who needs a film to lay everything out for me, but this would be like having been told for 9 hours (12 in the deluxe editions) that Sauron's One Ring must be destroyed, then in the closing moments being told that no, we can learn how to use it safely.",The Circle
259,thethomasboy,"More ""Antitrust"" than ""Social Network,"" despite promising cast.",3,15 July 2017,"""The Circle"" is based on a novel by Dave Eggers (who also co-wrote the screenplay). I've never read the book but there is a loose parallel here with Dante's Inferno; Virgil traveling down the slippery, spiralled slope of social media towards the entropic end of personal privacy. If that sentence seem heavy-handed, pretentious, and contradictory then prepare yourself for The Circle.The Circle is a multi-national tech conglomerate consisting of Google, Facebook, Snap, Instagram and Twitter rolled into one; a not-underused concept. Even less creativity went into the one-dimensional characters from a soap opera checklist, featuring: 1. Mae (Emma Watson), a naive 20-something just starting her career; 2. her over-worked best friend Annie (Karen Gillan); 3. her obviously evil COO Stenton (Patton Oswalt); 4. her sexy, enigmatic crush Ty (John Boyega); 5. her salt of the earth parents (Bill Paxton and Glenne Headly) and of course 6. her artsy, childhood friend Mercer (Ellar Coltrane) drowning in unrequited love, whose sole purpose is to set up the most obvious twist ever. The film flirts with high-minded allegory, yet wallows in hapless melodrama to pursue that lucrative YA audience. The result is a muddied, re-written mess, featuring stale dialogue, character arcs that go nowhere or flip randomly and frustratingly wooden portrayals. Certain scenes are SO contrived that it becomes wince inducing and the series of choices Mae makes are less naivety than they are blithe stupidity. The brightest points of the film are, not surprisingly, Tom Hanks' dangerously likable turn as CEO Bailey, (who seems to be an amalgam of Jobs and Gates).""The Circle"" is an After-School Special masquerading as high-brow entertainment. It's pretentious in the worst way, portending serious societal issues, then shirking away from addressing them in realistic, useful ways in order to manipulate the audience. It's muddled, unsure of itself, and gives adolescent answers to adult questions. With this cast and this concept it should have been so much MORE than it is. But ultimately it just argues itself in circles, and lends nothing to the discussion. Watch 'Eye in the Sky,' 'We Live in Public,' 'Ex Machina' or even 'Wall-E' for entertaining critiques on technology's role in society. Or stab your eyes out. Either way do not join The Circle.",The Circle

Specifically, I'm talking about Ellar Coltrane as Mercer. His delivery of lines and timing was painful. He really pulled me out of the movie. Was his character only allowed to watch the not funny parts Napoleon Dynamite growing up? He reminded me of the imaginary boyfriend from Inside Out, not much to say and only one way to say it. There was nothing natural about his delivery. It all seemed forced to me. I'm not sure if the issue with Mercer was because of the actor or the director, but I'm surprised that they didn't pick up on it during early focus groups.Compared to Mercer, the rest of the cast was amazing! The plot was OK. It went a little far at times, but still somewhat believable. Maybe the one Ty/Mae scene with the extended dialog between them was a little uneven, but nothing else really stood out as just OK.

Of course, there is the inevitable down side namely the obliteration of privacy. No matter where you go, you matter what you do, someone-body-thing is always watching you. There is in inevitable argument over how much surveillance is too much, is the security worth the price of freedom. I noticed this movie has received several negative reviews. I will admit this is not a conspiracy high-tech Jason Bourne style movie, there are no international assassins or cold blooded corporate executives trying to rule the world.

A small act of rebellion throws her up the corporate ladder and she's soon in the driver's seat, navigating the company's biggest, riskiest plans involving internet privacy.""The Circle"" is a warning advisory Big Brother cyber thriller combining plots from ""The Net"" (1995), ""The Truman Show"" (1998), ""Minority Report"", ""The Social Network"" to the recent ""Nerve"" and from a slew of Facebook-themed horror movies. We live in the digital age of out of the box, plugged in gadgets can be used as two-way a mirror. Whether we're freely making our lives accessible to family, friends and strangers, we're giving our privacy away without knowing what might happen. Emma Watson (hides her accent well) plays a sweet, intelligent and determined Mae, who gets a entry-level job with ""The Circle"", a huge and power hungry data-collecting and info-sharing company. Mae attends a corporate gathering called ""Dream Friday,"" everyone's in an on-site auditorium to take in the wisdom of The Circle's co- founder, Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), a Steve Jobs type alluring his worshipful flock with his warm, self- condemning humor and his grand visions. Eamon reveals a satellite connected camera the size of a small pebble that will cost less than pair of jeans he's sporting. Millions upon millions of these tiny cameras will placed in every spot in the world, without any government's permission.Yet another step in The Circle's grand plan for total global transparency, everyone will always be under observation and wouldn't the world be a better place without secrets of any kind? In one of the film's more efficiently unnerving scenes, two disturbingly lively Circle managers confront Mae after her first week on the job and scold her for not participating in ""non- mandatory"" late night and weekend company activities customized to her personal life. I'm referring to her hobby of kayaking and her father Vinnie's (the late Bill Paxton in his final film role) MS. Mae goes from joking about drinking the company Kool-Aid to guzzling it, with out hesitation. She's so emotionally strained its almost hard to tell if she's playing along or messing with them as she buys into The Circle's ever intrusive game plan and becomes a rising star, especially after she agrees to wear a body cam 24/7 and share every detail of her life with anyone who has joined The Circle.John Boyega (Finn in ""Star Wars"") plays Ty, the inventor of The Circle's technology, who keeps showing up at the most fitting times to act as Mae's conscience. What's really odd no one seems to notice him at all, he's like a ghost.Patton Oswalt is Eamon's side hand as The Circle's COO. Karen Gillan plays Mae's best friend Annie, whose purpose is obvious the first time she appears on screen. While I love Tom Hanks the screenplay doesn't give away anything about Bailey's motivations.

After finishing watching this film I've come too two conclusions, firstly that it can be very bad and secondly, I should have just stuck with the safe option of Harry Potter for anything to do with Emma Watson. 
At first it had potential, I thought it was going to be a dramatic story of a girl taking down a company but for the majority of the film, it's quite the opposite which had me confused and kind of wondering where the film was going. I wasn't keen on the cringy script and it was strange listening to Emma Watson with an American accent while her friend in the film was Scottish, does make me question why she needed to have the American accent at all but that's just how they did it. Also the chap that hated how the circle was heading and didn't agree with what it had become, what happened to him at the end? I felt he should have been more involved in whatever happened at the end but he was barely seen? There's so much I could critique about this movie but I'd be here all night.

279,user-46-247014,Slow-burn drama,7,10 January 2021,"This movie feels more on the family drama side of things. That in itself should be enough for you to decide if its your cup of tea. Not a bad movie, just a less popular genre, and many come expecting some sort of thriller will be disappointed.Some people might not like the pace of the story: more of a slow-burn drama or documentary speed flow. Topics of OSINT and social media overlords set in the near 'Black Mirror'-esque future. (I bet Black Mirror could do this entire movie better as an episode but alas).As you can imagine, boiling Apple, Google, Facebook, and all existing and imagineable social tech into one hypothetical company causes the movie to take a lot of logical shortcuts. It's less detail/intellectual of a movie and more of a dystopian concept movie. I would not call this a thriller since the majority of the movie is about the drama of socializing through technology and coming-of-age drama.There was only one moment where I didn't like how Emma Watson acted near the end; I must admit I watched this movie to see her performance. If you don't like her, she dominates the entire movie so that should be enough info to guess if you'll enjoy it. For me, overall entertaining movie that deserves 6.5-7 stars.",The Circle

Will have to read Egger's novel from which the movie was supposedly adapted. Hollywood has already made money off of Thien's book in THE FINAL CUT starring the late Robin Williams though they didn't pay Thien anything for it and Lionsgate (kittygate) said it was written by a Jordanian writer whom they could no longer contact when Thien wrote to them inquiring about the similarities. Then somebody committed suicide after it was discovered that much of his acting/comedic career (The Final Cut, Good Will Hunting, Dead Poet's Society) was fashioned after a real person who didn't profit from it one bit.

If the TPTB think that they can use the technology to just spy and exploit the consumers, they are sorely mistaken ... we will 'spy' them as well, technology doesn't work ... one way. They hide the biggest lies (aka secrets) ... they have the potential to commit grave criminal acts ... under the cover of 'state secret' ... they are the ones to fear disclosures ... and the disclosure is coming for them ... either way, as soon as a critical mass of people will realize that their 'secrecy' is not a requirement for the public mandate they were given, and informations can be gathered legit and with respecting fundamental rights! This is the future that will most likely happen ... not the one in the most dystopian movies ... we will have either a 100% participative democracy or anarchy ... different variations of the slave state ... are a thing of the past not the future. People will not give away any right they rightfully conquered so far ... and revert back to a tribal system of government. The main function of technology is to bring ideological evolution not involution.

However the idea that this level of privacy invasion could not only be achieved but lapped up by a fervent, cult like population in their millions in broad daylight is utterly ridiculous. Even more so in the cold light of 2021. There's a reason Facebook and Cambridge Analytica did all the dirty deeds this film is riffing on in the shadows.Watson's arc is also confusing. A naive working class girl dazzled but the bright lights is a sensible start. But the film tries in vain to balance this with her ascent within the company to become the biggest proponent of even more control over user's lives. Before she eventually comes good.

Contrary to some reviews it does have 'a story' and some great characters - it just progresses naturally at its own linear pace rather than rely on formulaic 'escalation' moments. Essentially the film is a progressive series of very interesting moments, every scene had me fascinated.I can accept that it isn't for everybody, and it isn't a perfect film which is reflected in my solid 8 stars out of 10. There are a couple of moments of ropey acting, even from the leads. The film hinges on a premise of fictional technology that sits on the cusp of what is real and what is not yet real, and rather than spoon-feed the audience as to what its all about the script instead relies on you having an awareness of what companies like Google and their parent Alphabet are already doing. If you are interested in technology then you will instantly draw comparisons between what is portrayed in the film and what already exists in reality.If you are reading review of this film because you think you MIGHT enjoy it, then do give it a try because you probably will!",The Circle

I kept thinking: ""why haven't I stopped this film yet?"" and it's only because I like to finish watching something I started, even if it's bad. I know that if I finish the film, then I can give it an honest review and here it is.'The Circle' should actually get a solid 1/10 but I'm giving it 2 extra points for Tom Hanks' great acting (as always) and the attempt at somewhat decent cinematography. Otherwise, the plot is jumbled up, the dialogue is so millennial, so exaggerated and so cheesy, it makes you want to curl up into a ball and hide from embarrassment for humanity. The message it tries to deliver is not very clear and certainly not a good one. Also, the possibility of something like this happening is almost 0%. If you're going to make a movie about the future, future technology and the future of social media, then put some thought into it and try to make it realistic so that people can go home and think about it for many days to come. I'd love to go through every single scene and analyze it in detail but I'd just get a headache.I believe that a complete and utter amateur made this film, then submitted it as a 'Black Mirror' episode for season 4, got an instant rejection and decided to release it as a feature film with a misleading poster (Tom Hanks doesn't appear nearly enough to warrant a picture on the poster) and a luring trailer, just to trick people into coming and hoping to at least break even or take a small loss on the whole thing.",The Circle

298,AaronDSimpson,Biting More than You Can Chew,6,7 July 2017,"The Circle is, essentially, a marriage between the tone of the television series Black Mirror (2011) and the theme of the video game Watch_Dogs (2014). Mae Holland (Watson) secures a customer experience position at tech-giant The Circle, run by Eamon Bailey (Hanks). There are numerous allusions to Apple throughout the film; a headquarters similar to the newly designed Apple Park; a self-sustaining and all-inclusive experience which includes colleague groups, employee support, and recreational areas; devices - tablets, watches, computers, and wristbands - are all linked up to each employee ensuring that they are permanently connected with each other and the cloud. Combining the thematic approach to 'Fifteen Million Merits' and 'Nosedive' from the Black Mirror anthology, The Circle uses feedback systems to monitor the progress they make at work, their customers' satisfaction, and their 'popularity', gained through engaging in almost-compulsory extra-curricular events. Yet, this is something that is introduced but left under-developed. Once it has been established, the narrative never revisits Holland's score, never demonstrates growth or decline, or really shows the consequences of those that don't meet the ideal score.The Circle includes Holland's parents onto their health plan to help with his struggle with multiple sclerosis, but everything is not perfect at the company. Holland is approached by Ty (Boyega) - a major designer responsible for the 'Tru You' software which sustains their in-house social media - and voices concern with the forced and superficial excitement of his fellow employees. It is understood that, after designing the revolutionary software, he went 'underground'. It isn't made clear how this was achieved whilst still working at The Circle and being surrounded by people that should, reasonably, recognise him.Holland is taken below ground into a disused subway tunnel where she learns that The Circle is installing servers to store all of the information gathered by the company's software. However, this is another string that is tugged and left to fall loose over the plot. Once Holland visits the server room, she never returns, the viewer is never allowed to see the scale of the servers or the ramifications of storing the masses of personal data. However, the suggestion is enough to plant a see of doubt in the viewer's mind about the dangers of surveillance.When the company reveals the 'See Change', a small adhesive camera that can be deployed all over the world, there is further cause for concern. First praised for being a tool for witnessing civil rights infractions, the 'See Change' soon becomes a tool to find fugitives. However, when a demonstration turns to find a civilian, Holland's friend Mercer (Coltrane), it results in his death and inspires disillusionment with the concept. During the grief process, Mae goes kayaking in the river at night, capsizes, and is rescued by the camera operators watchful gaze.The Circle unveils the true horror of a surveillance-state when Mae decides to go 'fully transparent' and wears a 'See Change' camera all the time. Over the course of her broadcasting she builds up to two and a half million streamers which support her through Mercer's death and an awkward episode of catching her parents making love. An unexpected change of heart causes Holland to turn on her employers, Bailey and Stenton (Oswalt), by inviting them to go 'fully transparent' and leaks their emails, private emails, and company documents. This turn cannot really be described as a twist as much as an appearance from Beck can be described as a twist. Similar to a twist, it comes out of nowhere, with no indication of its arrival, the only difference is that the viewer finds it difficult to empathise with the significance of the event.The impression is that, rather than taking down the tech company, Holland has simply performed a hostile takeover, demonstrating her belief that 'Sharing is Caring - Secrets are Lies - Privacy is Theft'. The Circle is a film that demonstrates real potential; exploring events that are relevant and engaging in an increasingly technologically dependent society. However, the real disappointment is that the film attempts to adopt a little more than it can raise. Between secret servers, surveillance, underground agitators, conspiracy, and technological development there isn't much room left for character dynamism, plot continuity, and developed tropes. That being said, The Circle is not a bad film and definitely provokes thought for those open to questioning the progression of technology. If all else fails, watching Tom Hanks stroll around a building for two hours is entertaining enough.Read more reviews at 'The Cineaste Review' on WordPress - www.thecineastereview.wordpress.com",The Circle

That is the message I hoped would come from this movie, but instead of insulting our modern social networks out there, the movie panders to them.

309,QuintLives,Quite literally a pointless waste of time,2,5 May 2017,"I don't even know what this movie is. I expected it to be a thriller based on the trailers, but that isn't really accurate. There isn't any suspense or a central conflict or really even a villain. It doesn't have enough of a perspective to be a satire. I guess it's a drama, though it isn't particularly dramatic. Watching this movie may have been one of the most bland, emotionless experiences of my life. It is the kind of movie that I can barely muster the energy to discuss, though I must do so before I completely forget that it exists. Based on the fact that it took me my whole drive to work this morning to remember how it ended, the clock is definitely ticking.Emma Watson plays a young customer service rep named Mae that gets hired at a social media company called The Circle that is run by Tom Hanks and Patton Oswalt. The company seems intent on putting miniature cameras all over the world to create a completely linked, transparent society. The legal and logistical problems with this are never addressed, so let's just go with it. Mae then volunteers to be the first person to wear one of these cameras 24/7. Then some stuff happens and eventually it ends. None of the stuff is linked together in a way that would assemble a meaningful plot, so I don't know what to tell you. There is no arc or structure to this film. Stuff just happens without consequence or meaning. Mae sometimes seems to be ethically offended by the company, but then she will do things like volunteer to wear the camera and suggest that the website be required by the government and used for voter registration. The villains aren't really villains, they are just the dudes running the company. They don't do anything more evil than any real-life social media executives do. If Tom Hanks is meant to be villainous, then that is some awful casting because the guy is just too damn likable. Tom Hanks could set me on fire and I would still want to grab a beer with him if I survived. Mae's ex-boyfriend (I think) seems to hate social media (never explained why) and spends his time in a log cabin hunting deer. The website members chase him down to put him online, causing him to drive off a bridge and die (there are no consequences to this). Mae's friend (played by Karen Gillan, also known as the blue girl in Guardians of the Galaxy) looks increasingly depressed and strung out as the movie goes along, but I'm not sure why. Is she jealous? Is she having an ethical dilemma? Did Taco Bell remove her favorite menu item? Could somebody please ask this girl what's wrong? She seems troubled. Am I rambling? That happens when you discuss movies without any sense of narrative structure.The movie doesn't even seem to have a stance on its own subject matter. The main character can't decide if what she's doing is right or wrong. The company executives have their secret email accounts brought public by Mae at the end, but I have no idea what's in those emails or if there is anything incriminating. The company still exists at the end. The last scene is Mae smiling when she is swimming and sees drones flying around her. Why the hell is she smiling? Is she against this or for it? Did anything bad come of the emails? Is there a single repercussion to anything that happened? Why the hell does this movie exist?I spent much of this film with my mind wandering. I wondered if I should try fishing. I wondered what the difference is between jelly and jam. My mind desperately tried to give me something to focus on other that the coma-inducing film on screen.

310,genslen,Some Great Concepts but Eventually Collapses Under its Own Smartness,4,19 March 2018,"Movie Review: ""The Circle"" Rating: 2 out of 5 stars""The Circle,"" starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks, asks an important question: it privacy a silly relic of the past? Mae (Emma Watson) gets a job at The Circle, a massive silicon valley company intentionally patterned after Facebook and Google. She settles into the company, which operates from an idyllic, park-like campus in a massive building shaped like a circle. Soon, she's assisting customers and pressured into joining the herd mentality of the Circle staff members.Run by Eamon Bailey (Tom Hanks), the Circle uses it's Facebook-like reach to ""help"" users by infiltrating every aspect of their daily lives, and is actively working to ""help"" more people by creating even more ways to invade their privacy. Their new initiative, ""SeeChange,"" involves placing miniature cameras everywhere. Eamon Bailey says the omnipresent camera system is designed to save people, but in a way that virtually eliminates any concept of privacy in public. ""Knowing is good but knowing everything is better,"" Bailey says at one point. But the new system, which Mae tests, exposes everything she does to a online audience, bringing embarrassment for herself and tragedy for those around her.Ultimately, the movie fails on its promise as the story gets muddled in the middle when the story abruptly changes direction and Emma Watson's character becomes an integral part of the company. She must then decide whether or not to go along with the founder's schemes or expose them. I feel like the script needed another round or two of revisions to work out some of the obvious plot issues, and the ending is strange. I'll leave it for you to decide, but I thought the ending was a weird and somewhat creepy cop-out.The Circle, directed by James Ponsoldt, is based on a book by David Eggars, and stars Tom Hanks, Emma Watson, and, in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role, John Boyega. Released in 2017. Interestingly, Emma Watson's parents are played by Bill Paxton, who died before the film's release, and Glenne Headly, who died two months after the film's release.",The Circle
311,mgually,This is an example of...,1,7 February 2020,"...how poor and trivial a movie can be. It isn't enough to have a message behind a story to make it a good story. Every person with a little bit of brain can understand, just in the very first minutes, what is the message and what is the wrong part of it. I can do it by myself: ""hey guys, don't give away all your privacy to big companies!"". This doesn't make me the best deep thinker on the planet about the profound, complicated problems involved in such a difficult social topic. This movie is very poor on anything. Poor screnplay, poor acting, superficial examination and treatment of the privacy problem, unrealistic behavior of the characters without any reasons for the ways they act. So... a very important subject with heavy future implications treated in the worst, trivial and irritating way.",The Circle
312,pmassey-23533,Great!,8,1 September 2017,"OK, I know it's fashionable to be 'down' on Hanks, but he was great, playing the avuncular 'visionary' here. I suppose that I was and am more interested in the philosophical aspects than filmography or whatever, and, on that level, this film is good fun.Sure, the message is simple, but simple is good. One does experience a certain moral ambivalence about tech and its all-pervading, all-seeing nature...Google-bad, FB-bad etc. And of course they are. But is every aspect of these companies bad? Are all the sequelae of their underpinning philosophies harmful? Are there good aspects of everybody knowing everything about everybody? And do those outweigh the harmful outcomes? If so, to what extent? On balance are secrets a good thing or a bad thing?So, the key issue is not really about tech per se, but rather the issue of privacy. As always, the key question is whether one has anything to fear about being 'transparent' as Emma Watson's character is. I mean, if you do nothing bad, and think nothing bad, what do you have to fear from an Orwelian Big Brother? Why fear being watched all the time, if you are doing nothing wrong? And, if everyone is being watched, it allows us to see, find and punish the baddies, right?the question is who decides who the baddies are? And who decides what behaviour is to be condemned? OK, we can say murderers are bad people. But what about people who do rude things with sex toys, as the parents do here? Who, ultimately decides what behaviour is 'bad'. And who elects, as our moral guardians, those 'deciders'? Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?This film answers that question with a poignant denouement. I think it's well done. One thing I have learned about both film and book reviews is that one should never trust professional reviewers. Indeed, in my experience, the films to watch tend to be those that are slated by the critics. They just come across as resentful frustrated actors, artists, or writers. Trust real people.",The Circle

315,kevinlemenager,They're Watching You,2,16 October 2017,"The Circle is a mixed bag of ideas that, in my opinion, could have been much better. Now I'm not the kind of guy who reads a book before seeing a movie, but I decided to for this movie. Mostly because I wanted to see the movie by myself. The Circle, written by Dave Eggers, is the story of a young woman named Mae who gets a position at the prestigious tech company ""The Circle."" I found the book to be rather interesting (although a bit of a downer). The book is so dense that I figured they'd cut a lot and change things around. The movie manages to keep just about all the dialogue the same, but it does cut some stuff that I felt was important. In the end it makes for a very messy movie that probably shouldn't have been made into a movie. Even with a star studded cast. I see The Circle more as a collection of ideas that are more or less likely in the real world. Ideas like full time surveillance are just too much of a scary thought.

The Circle is well made amalgam of these two corporations. We already have the surveillance everywhere, people sharing their day to day lives even in the smallest bits. With services like Snapchat, Tinder, Instagram, Facebook people become transparent, hide nothing, keep nothing private and personal. Both FB and Google are trying to get everyone on board, by all means necessary. People don't have private life, everything is public and reachable by everyone who is interested. Imagining future like the one in the movie is not only possible but very much coming our way. I agree with some points . I do thing that everyone who is eligible to vote should vote.

319,StAdrian,Multiple failures,4,16 July 2017,"Perhaps I went into the movie theater with very high expectations. Or perhaps ""The Net"" has imprinted on me too deeply at a very young age. Whatever the explanation, The Circle objectively fails to engage the viewer, to leave a memorable experience. Yes, the movie has all the ingredients for success, but it somehow fails to touch.The first problem is the camera work. Watson's performance is more than worthy, but the camera fails to capture it in an engaging way. On the other hand, Coltrane (Mercer) is just appalling. Both the camera and Coltrane's performance make the scenes between The Heroine and her love interest(?) look cheap, and the line delivery wooden. All this is particularly bad in a scene of a fight between the two - a scene with a lot of emotion - that is filmed literally from outside the building! Most of the time in that scene, all you see is two vaguely familiar human shapes, and you cannot connect to the characters. Add this to the wooden dialogue of the scene, and it turns into a complete failure.The script contains too many narrative roles rather than characters. It diversifies without delivering, and major key plot events are missing. Episodes of hacking that should feature in a such movie, are completely absent, even though the results are dramatic for the story. For some characters, sudden dramatic changes take place completely off screen, leaving the viewer rather bewildered, struggling to fill in the gaps. Another problem with the script is that it does not give The Heroine too much credit. It reuses expressions like ""let's take it a step farther"" and strongly suggests that a CEO of a company like Apple or Google would accept advice from an intern on matters that border national security or the definition of democracy. It is ridiculous and it turns the movie into a science fiction wannabe. It would have been much more believable if The Heroine would have discovered those things, struggle with them, question them and then act.Boyega (Ty) does step out of his Star Wars role. He is less intense and believable, but his character lacks depth and plays almost no role in the movie as a whole. Again, it's the script! One could realistically argue that the outcome would be the same with or without Boyega's character showing The Heroine an empty tunnel and provide her with a confused, fragmented story that is neither about the past, the present or the future, but a hodgepodge of memories and concerns that are not backed by the plot.All in all, the idea had potential, the theme is a current one, but the camera work and the unfinished (?) script fly this movie right into the ground.",The Circle
320,Oldschooldoom,Brilliant movie that we love to hate,8,4 August 2017,"This movie made me want to vomit until near the end. Not because of the acting or casting or anything else the nit picky critics have denounced it for. But I felt ill how far technology can (and some say will) invade our privacy. Social media and big brother spying on individuals via satellite and personal devices is just the beginning. I am creeped out how politically correct silicon valley has become. It's no secret that this movie combines the utopian workplaces of Google and Facebook and mixes in a measure of the Truman Show. Truly it wasn't until the very end did I feel a sense of redemption so clever, so brilliant that this could give my favorite brilliant redemptive movie a run for it's money. If you aren't familiar, check out The Shawshank Redemption.

321,lerxstwannabe,110 minute infomercial?,4,8 July 2017,"This movie either feels like a shallow, late-night infomercial, a cheesy after-school special, or a movie that got ""post-productioned"" to death on the chopping block.The characters make, seemingly abrupt, 180 turns in their judgment and opinions, without any explanation, or expository hints as to why. You almost have to try your mind-reading ability and then give your best guess a lot of times.The pacing of the story moves at break-neck speeds, leaving you to wonder how and why the characters did what they did, as fast as they did and made leaps in logic as fast as they do.The acting, while good, is not enough to save the shallow, incomplete feel the movie has to it either. As always though, Tm Hanks steals the show - it's just a shame he had to be in this movie!After watching the movie, I can't figure out if it's trying to tell me the actions, events and opinions expressed by the main character(s) are good, bad, moral or immoral. I like to think the lead character is supposed to be a ""good"" person, but some of her decisions really leave me questioning her true motives. The end and her reaction to some key parts in the movie, leaves me wondering what kind of a heartless, *insert phrase here*, she really is.On the more forgivable side, there are plenty of loose... err... sorta of poorly tied... ends. You're not really given much closure for a lot for elements and character stories.Either there is a lot of this movie that never made it off the chopping block, and is littering the recycling bin on hard drive somewhere, or the movie was really made this hastily and exposes its flaws for all of us to see.I know there was some larger message it was trying to relay and point to get across; it's obvious that it was trying, too hard, even. In order to appreciate that message though, there's just way too much clutter, poor writing, incomplete stories and unbelievable logic- gaps to get past.Antitrust (2001) was actually a much better movie, from the storytelling aspect, with a similar message and equally talented acting.

326,alanaawram,Spoiler free review of The Circle. An interesting movie that really makes you think.,7,6 May 2017,"Last weekend, I went to see the circle. Now, after thinking about the movie for almost an entire week I can say that I am ready to write a review. I give this movie a 7-7.5 because I did enjoy and like it, but it wasn't perfect and I did have questions. My main problem was that the movie was too short, and I think it didn't do a proper job explaining everything to us. Now, don't get me wrong, I think it's great when the audience is left wondering, left with questions. But The Circle left me with too many.I'm going to start with the characters/actors. First, obviously, Mae Holland/Emma Watson. I really liked Mae. She was a smart, likable character. All she wanted to do was what was right. She was nice, and had a vision for the future. Then she had her flaws, making her a very relatable character. Emma Watson did an amazing job portraying her. When I watched the movie, I did not see Emma Watson, I saw Mae Holland. Next, Eamon Bailey/Tom Hanks. While I wasn't a huge fan of Eamon Bailey, Tom Hanks did a very good job playing the part. I feel like the character was very well done, and so was the acting job. Next, Ty/John Boyega. This is where I run into problems. I think John Boyega did a great job on the role, but the role of Ty itself isn't a great one to play. I thought the character of Ty had potential, but he really didn't do much. In fact, he was hardly more than an extra to me. And the way he met, then instantly trusted Mae was unbelievable, I feel like it would have been much better if they had had more time to get to know one another. Finally, Annie/Karen Gillian. Karen Gillian did a beautiful acting job, which I think made Annie a better character than I would otherwise think. At the start of the movie, Annie is on top of things, a bright, bubbly, hard worker. Then she suddenly changes personality, and I don't know why. I wish it would have explained what had pushed her over the edge.The movie itself was good and enjoyable, but could have been even better if it had been a bit longer and explained more. I thought it was well paced and I was excited to find out what comes next, but then the movie suddenly ended without a real conclusion, and I was left shocked and confused. I have mixed views on the ending because 1. It shows how the story continues, and symbolizes the statement of an ending is a new beginning or 2. I was questioning what exactly happened and what was going to happen and I was a little bit upset.Overall I do recommend to go and watch The Circle because it is a movie that really makes you think because there was no black and white. Instead, it showed how both sides had positive and negatives. The acting is very well done and I did have a good time watching the movie. It was only when the movie was over and I was left to think about it that I started to have questions and concerns.",The Circle

The inevitable death of Marcer, that was meant to be dramatic and the end for The Circle wasn't realistic enough. The emotions were exaggerated and even the car crash felt unreal.Marcer's death should wake people to see the limitations and the effects of initial plans of The Circle. Does that happen? No. Nobody seems to give a damn, in fact, and no laws are created after this. Psychologists, sociologists and human rights' security look like things that have gone extinct. Also, the whole purpose of the transparency scheme didn't make any sense. Why would someone abdicate of its own privacy? No one that I know. And it doesn't stop there... Mae goes transparent and because of this she earns many followers, people watch her life 24/7 without getting bored.

The Circle is just plain undecided and bland, a movie that bounces around some ideas about the dangers but also possible advantages of social media, networking, privacy and full disclosure, all of this without placing itself or its character in any critical position towards these ideas and issues. This makes both the story and the characters be all over the place, not believable at all and..simply confused. Just like the viewer. The story in short: At first, we think Mea is a normal girl that will be shocked and appalled by the cringe-worthy intrusive approach of the company and her colleagues and bring down the great ""Big Brother"" evil circle. Then, all of a sudden she becomes a ""believer"" in Big Brother and starts, completely unconvincing, by the way, support its cause. Then she realizes she made a mistake...and pushes the intrusiveness even further in the end. What kind of a normal human reaction is that??

(*)The Film is very rushed and this story line should of been a TV Show instead of a 2 hour film. A lot of the important story line is cut from the movie, in doing this it has caused me confusion as time is just skipped and we only see a fraction of what actually goes on. as personally I wanted to really see what the company was about as all we really see is a fraction of Mae working and the rest is her having conversations on stage or with her parents etc. This film is way to rushed a should of been a mini-series as it allows for deeper meaning and allows the viewer to get to know the characters and the company before the ending. * - WARNING MAJOR SPOILER - * The Ending was S**t in my opinion the way the way the Mae just turns her back on the two CEO is good as they are depicted as they want everyone's information accessible but want to keep there life private. However she just back-stabs Ty who helped her to take down both CEO's of the company as he wanted for people to live a private life which wasn't Mae's intentions.

To be sure, there are companies like the one in this film, but there are also people who assume any corporation, once successful, becomes automatically evil.In fact, corporations are not made up of evil aliens, they are humans. So, like all humans, some are jerks, a few are exemplary, but most are somewhere in between.This is an okay film that drags a bit in middle.

An interesting and very relevant topic for a movie. Unfortunately, this movie can be summed up in 1 word: Lazy. Lazy screen writing, lazy directing, lazy acting. Everything in the plot was a well-used, worn-out cliché. There was really nothing new or original in the entire movie. Nor do we learn anything about any of the characters except for the lead character. We know nothing about the motivations of the (closest thing to a) hero or anything about the nerdy suitor or the friend who helped her get the job. What motivated the ""hero"" to first help build the system that is now ""worse than I thought"" - and we aren't privy to what he meant when he said that - and then to become the (more-or-less) hero or the ""best friend"" to become an unfriend and then to magically return to being the best friend without any need for any reconciliation because the plot required it?",The Circle

Well, Mae, you must be really scared of this movie because that's exactly what it is.I went to see this, despite all of the negative reviews, primarily for being a fan of several of the actors; in this respect, I wasn't disappointed. I found all of the performances - especially John Boyega's and Karen GIllan's - enjoyable. Overall, from the performance standpoint, I thought the movie was decent, even if John Boyega (who plays the most interesting character in the movie, by far) was criminally underused. I enjoyed the music, as well.Where the movie starts to fall apart, however, is in its structure. I found myself thinking about it afterwards, trying to figure out what about it that is just off. I came to this conclusion: It's as if they filmed an outline or a rough draft of the film. The major plot points are there, some of the characters are developed, but the film just isn't connected yet. There are a lot of flat characters and subplots that could be further explored, and definitely some things to be trimmed. The climax of the film seems to be in an awkward place as well, almost as if it should take place 15 minutes earlier, or the movie should be a bit longer (even though it was already dragging).In the end, I don't think it's nearly as bad as a lot of people are saying; I certainly don't regret seeing it. I just wish the film had fulfilled its potential because I really think it could have been quite good. My recommendation: Either wait for the second-run theater or for the DVD. If you don't want to wait and want see it for the actors (like I did), I'd say go ahead and go, but just don't expect too much out of it.",The Circle

361,nkgenovese-72838,The Circle makes an interesting point despite itself,7,8 May 2017,"While it is not the best movie you will see in the theater this year, The Circle makes a pleasant enough afternoon's diversion. The movie follows Emma Watson as Mae Holland, a young woman who gets a job as a customer service rep at the titular Circle, a seeming progressive tech company that if you have seen the trailer you know turns out to have a sinister side.The film has clearly been edited to remove the darker elements of the book it is based on but that inadvertently proves a strength. The villains are no longer out to take over the world but are now simply corporate suits willfully ignoring the downsides of their new technology in their bid for corporate power. They are friendly faces, perfectly portrayed by Tom Hanks and Patton Oswalt, whose pasted-on affability never wavers even when they are doing demonstrably immoral things. They're not monsters, they're just businessmen.My major complaint with this movie is that Mae's old friend, Mercer, played by Ellar Coltrane seems superfluous. He's just not as good an actor as the rest of the cast and he comes off as a creepy stalker in this interactions with Mae. I know that he is an important character in the book but the conflict he presents, forcing Mae to choose between the Circle and her friends, could have been given to Karen Gillan as Mae's other friend Annie. As a result, Gillan's character is not given much to do other than a subplot that seems a bit rushed. Also underutilized is John Boyega's potential love interest character. However, despite this, the Circle is an intriguing look at how in business, ruthless acts hide behind a kind smile.",The Circle

Her intentions to join the circle are not elaborate enough and barely have any emotional background on which the viewer could empathize with her.Once Mae joins the circle she discovers Ty (John Boyega) who shows her the flaws of the system he has constructed. As an audience member you really wish the director would have given him more on screen time, since you get the impression he is the part of a greater effort of exposing the flaws of the system.The way the movie concludes is simply pathetic and too short. One gets the impression that they ran out of time or budget at that point. Its seems like Mae simply finds a stupid problem in the system, exposes it and the antagonist Bailey just gives up completely and admits his defeat.Personally I cannot recommend this movie to anyone since it fails on multiple levels and cannot even conclude in an appropriate exciting way that is enticing to the viewer.",The Circle

Not only about it's overall message but about how the director decided to portray this film. He did it in a way I have never seen before. He took a realistic issue of today's technological world, privacy, and advanced his opinion of its importance without explicit proclamation through the characters. He let the premise speak for itself. It was totally unexpected and the I was left on the edge of my seat confused on how the conflict was going to be resolved. But yet, it never did. Well just not in the way I thought. A wonderful element that could have been passed over if not very vigilant was the comments on Mae's transparency stream. That is where both sides of every issue were shown just like the internet does today. This movie did have many drawbacks though. It could have had a better build up and resolution rather than spending so much time building the premise. Mercer's character was flawed and the acting was stressed to fulfill it's purpose. Overall, Emma Watson and Tom Hanks were fabulous as always and the movie achieved exactly what it wanted to. Made me think, but I'm not a huge fan of allegories.",The Circle

It's one technological advance and breakthrough after another that comes on about as horrific as one can anticipate where one group has all the power and information.

366,dave-621-970299,Well-Funded Reach Toward Potent Topic - Missing the Mark,3,1 May 2017,"I wanted to like this movie, but it really fell flat. I'll try to list a few reasons that I haven't seen listed by other reviewers: 1. If it's a thriller, the protagonist is never in any real danger - and we don't really see enough of a villain, or a villain's plan to fell any suspense or excitement. 2. Things that could have delivered some interesting story lines, were introduced, but never pursued or paid off. For example, Mae catches one of the first SeeChange cameras, but never does anything with it. Even when she's let in to the company president's innovation lair, she doesn't use the camera. That could have given us some 'antagonist' story points to feed the rest of the limp plot. Also, she is taken (secretly) to a data-storage warehouse, but nothing ever really comes of that. 3. We are asked to suspend not just disbelief, but common sense:The SeeChange camera and data source, the size of a glass marble, is supposed to capture images, beam them to satellites, and do all kinds of data analysis - with no means to be powered or otherwise accessed.When Mae secretly visits the company president's lair, and the data warehouse (top secret) in a company saturated with cameras and data-collection - we need to believe that there are no cameras in those special places. 4, The Film presumes that a Facebook/Google mashup company would be able to say that the government needs them more than they need the government. Probably not true. They make not mention of NSA (that I caught) and they presume that 'transparency' = more sharing of what you (with your actual name and address) are doing every single moment. That's the obvious view of the future, but not the most interesting (to me). There are several other scenarios that are richer - completely missed in this film.They had the budget, the talented actors - and they missed the mark.",The Circle
367,nuclear_brownies,Didn't evil get beaten by a greater evil?,8,24 June 2017,"The ending, is I think why this movie is getting such a bad rating. Some people were expecting Emma to be the 'good guy' and overthrow the system, others were expecting her to join the bad guys. I've read a short article about Ponsoldt, the director's intentions on Business Insider. To me it seems that the ending is the creepily ambiguous one it should be. At first you think Emma is saving the day, but then you realize she's just condemned the entire world to zero privacy. Ponsoldt said that he thinks technology etc. in itself is good, but the way large corporations handle it is wrong. This view is seen in the ending, but we don't get the full happy end feeling. The music and last shot of the billboard, broadcasting 'everything' doesn't necessarily make us feel all good. I didn't feel that anyway. But that's just it, technology and where it seems to be heading isn't necessarily all good. It's unsure, it's up to us to make sure it does end up good. If anything the ending causes you to talk about these issues, which is probably the best effect you could have, and also the only thing Eggers wants to achieve. To me it did feel like the ending was solely grim. And I liked that. Emma gives the power to the people 100%, but in doing that also eliminates privacy completely. Besides the ending I was happy that the film wasn't as tame as I feared. I'm happy sex was at least named although I would have liked a little more depth on that issue. 3 minutes for the bathroom OK, global democracy agrees on that, but what are the time limitations for intercourse? If they don't create time windows for that, this is the new pornography. And if they do how long are they? And when? And what's to say you don't use that time to 'be your worst self'. 3 minutes doesn't give you a whole lot of time, but.... 20? 10 at the least? It's getting too PERSONAL already.

It's so predictable, the writing was cringe-worthy, mediocre acting, and it was so so unrealistic. The Circle is about a woman who begins working at The Circle, a Facebook/Google/Apple-like company, a utopian world turned dystopian. As the story progresses, she works her way to the top, while striving to lead the world into having zero privacy, as she becomes ""transparent"" herself - allowing the world to watch and hear her every move all day. Mae is one of the most naive and easily-influenced characters I have ever witnessed in film history. It blows my mind how a sheep-like character like her could be portrayed as both a victim and a victor. Her parents cut off contact with her due to her, her close friend dies because of her actions, she grieves for about 3 days, and then returns to her work at the Circle, suddenly showing zero empathy as she joins back in her cult-like work, taking no responsibility for her actions.And don't even get me started on the ending. She still goes on with her idea of wanting the world become transparent, yet unmasks the corporate heads. And for what?3.5 stars because the idea was good, it was a decent movie to watch if you have nothing to do, and sure, I can see how it can be thought-provoking for some, though it still would've been more thought-provoking a decade ago.

On paper, the themes of The Circle are very intriguing; However, as seen, it is not presented in any compelling or fulfilling way. For a film set in the present day -with The Circle mirroring major tech corporations- and focusing on private and public opinions on the implications of technology on safety The Circle has little stance on the issues shed. It shows private surveillance in a negative light for the majority of the film, despite the fact that only a few characters oppose it. Every turn in the plot is unconvincing and frustrating, but admittedly surprising. The ending of the film is not satisfying in any way. In terms of cinematic devices, The Circle completes the bare minimum in order to have a plot. The sound-design, editing, and cinematography are bland.

379,shmugle-666-722189,Emma Watson....,2,10 July 2017,"Literally the only thing that needs to be said about this film is that Emma Watson is the star. Her career should have ended with the Harry Potter series as nothing she has produced since has offered any form of true entertainment value. Sorry scratch that The Perks Of Being A Wallflower wasn't too bad but everything else has been downright terrible. It's like you see one movie with Emma Watson in it and you've seen them all. I want to watch Colony also by her but am reluctant, same with Beauty and the Beast which I don't even know how she was cast for that.Why do I not like her acting? She lacks human emotion. As if she has only experienced life through reading scripts and counting money. Ironic considering part of the meaning of this film. It may be expected for child actors/actresses to overdue facial expressions in a cute sort of way but when that carries on into an adult career, it's no longer cute but rather blatantly intentional thus destroying the mood. Every smirk or smile she makes looks forced rather than natural. As for her vocal performance she might as well have the script in her hand during the movie because her dull tone makes it seem like she's reading it out from a teleprompter anyways.As for the movie itself and why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The concept. The concept is the only thing that I took from this movie and thought hey that's interesting. The technology connecting everything part, the hazards and benefits. So they took a decent concept, threw in a washed out has-been (or three to be honest), slapped social media text all over the screen in a way that you could barely read them anyways (are we supposed to pause the movie during those moments), failed to dive into the concept more (could have been taken so much further), inhuman reactions to situations that occurred and finally killed it completely with a terrible ending to an overall mess of a plot.Instead of finishing this movie with a heart wrenching ""oh my gosh"" moment of awakening, like it seems you're are supposed to feel, I instead finished it feeling empty. As if I was hoping for a four course meal and instead got a piece of bread and butter. The climax felt really lame leading to a ridiculous reaction and an expected conclusion which again didn't offer anything of meaningful depth. Social media is good in ways but when overdone it can be harmful. Unplug. See the world through your eyes not a screen. Yawn.

There was an obvious, in your face message of the dangers of a world surrounded by surveillance and a lack of 'privacy' in a futuristic digital world. The main character Mae's decisions are so contradictory to her established personality, she feels very superficial and hard to relate to. Her actions seem to be without motive or any prior driving force. The very apparent difference between a series like Black Mirror and a film like Circle, is that the former allows room for question of ethics and basic human rights.

If you have children, teens, friends oblivious to the fact that the internet and streaming are NOT private, then you must get them to go see this movie - and the social message is the reason why I rate this as an ""8"". Leader of the company (Tom Hanks) and Chief Tech Officer (Patton Oswalt) deem everyone except themselves should be transparent, including government. When a political obstacle arises in a Senator, of course they dig up and release the dirt on them found in their 'social sins', then sponsor a candidate that is willing to be transparent in every email, every call, every action, every bill, etc. (Naivety at its best, as no company or government can operate 100% transparent.) In the end, the good persona (Emma Watson) turns the tables on the powerful leaders in front of an audience and makes them susceptible to the very elements they want others subservient to. I don't usually care for Tom Hanks, but he did a good job in this film - with an outstanding low- level ""we're f'd"" comment once realizing the tables have turned. Ms. Watson continues to grow in her acting skills and shines even brighter than Mr. Hanks in a few scenes (but not overall). Patten Oswalt plays the tough bad-guy in his outstanding short scenes, and fit the role perfectly. The role of John Boyega (as Ty) left a bit to be desired (a 2D character that should have had more depth provided), but liked his acting much better in this film, compared to his role as Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens; he did well.",The Circle

And it also has a pretty cool coverphoto. I trusted the peoples reviews and gave it a try since I love watching Emma Watson and Tom Hanks within any flick; and this one right here had some interesting story about our possible future life.Actually, its good to have movies like these where we face the problems that might occur, but this flick did not reach its potential and got totally ruined by itself.Despite the sudden ending, leaving a massive plothole and the cheesy and weak dialogs throughout the entire film it has some nice moments where accidentally the cinematography was having a few good seconds, the score was fitting and the lights perfect. but that was it, the car scene, beautifully captured. Tom Hanks was doing a decent job as company boss having speeches and a very natural charismatic aura that kept my attention every time. Awkward is the word I would use Emma's acting here, I don't think she's good to play a young adult or teenager since it becomes too cheesy, remembering her role in ""the bling ring"".Dialogs have been used to lose my interest in any detailed conversation, unexplainable mindchanging moments.

386,ej_blackburn,"So Much Potential, Such a Disappointment",3,30 October 2017,"With a cast including such talent as Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Emma Watson, John Boyega, and Patton Oswalt, you'd expect one heck of a thrilling tale to unfold in this sci-fi meets current-world social media film, at least I did...Instead I was utterly disappointed as this movie progressively became so watered down by poor writing, poor character development, and poor plot development. It almost felt like they ran out of money to tell the story they should have told, which happens all too often in novel to film adaptations. Sure, the writers had the big picture in mind in the beginning of the film, and dropped some huge plot points along the way, but never fully explored any of them, and decided instead to bail out by climaxing on the death of a friend of the main character as he was chased down by drones and social media freaks during a ""live testing"" of the product everyone was supposed to buy into.John Boyega's character was rarely present and I could never discover his purpose in the film other than to warn Watson's character that the business was wrong, but then why did he hang around? If he actually built the basis for the technology, then why didn't he help take it down? What good did he do? Watson's best friend was cheery in the beginning and excited for her good friend to join this amazing revolutionary tech company, but eventually felt angry at her employers without much more explanation than appearing to be jealous of her friend climbing the ladder of success and getting more attention by becoming the spokeswoman for the company. But this is never fully revealed. Why not? Bill Paxton, which such a tremendous resume, rest in peace dear sir, could have had a much larger role as well, fighting the system alongside his daughter instead of being used as a prop.The writers simply took the easy way out. If you can't afford the actors, then don't put them in a position to do a film like this. It is probably a regrettable addition to the resumes of all the top actors in this movie, albeit a paycheck. If you can watch it for cheap or for free, then there are at least a few interesting and well done scenes and the overall discussion of social media and how far it should play into government and our private lives is explored.This film had so much potential, but just couldn't deliver probably due to budget restraints and high paid actors. Hanks may have had the best role in the film, but it felt wasted by too many other flaws. Too bad because this could have been awesome... What a shame.",The Circle

After I finished the book (and whilst reading it), I couldn't believe how Mae basically killed her ex boyfriend, so I was quite happy with the way they filmed that scene and made it obvious that Mae didn't want to go after Mercer. In the book Mercer's described as someone chubby (and a really obnoxious and unpleasant person IMO) and as someone Mae can't even imagine ever being with, in the movie they seem to get along quite well, despite the disagreements about social media. Only thing that I had wished to see in the movie (had it been someone else other than John Boyega playing the part of Ty as in the book he's described with gray, nearly white hair and as someone really mysterious which John really isn't) was the relationship between himself and Mae. It couldn't be more platonic in the movie, whereas in the book there was always this (sexual) tension between those two.

Tom Hanks does a great job at creating a lovable character with no obvious villainous undertones. This goes a long way in expressing the movie's key concept that the radical decay of individual privacy is harmless and well intentioned. Basically, there's no obvious evil force driving the company to take over the world. Emma Watson's character goes through some character changes that I didn't expect. I thought she did a good job of transitioning through the movie.John Boyega's character could have been played by anyone else. He brought very little to the role. It's fair to say this is a ""time-filler"" for him between Star Wars movies. I could imaging them shooting his sequences in less than three days.Patton Oswalt's role was good. He was the more forceful presence at the company, freeing up Tom Hanks to play the likable visionary.SPOILER ALERT: Knowing that the table is going to be turned and not seeing the outcome isn't a great way to end a movie. I liked how Emma's character turned the employees' culture of unbridled enthusiasm against the C level executives, but this lacked punch as the only pay-off for the movie.TAKEAWAY: Like a Black Mirror episode, this movie does a good job of showing how privacy can be (and is being) eroded with the consent of the population.

Mae's perpetual and hopeful naivete didn't coincide with her actions at all. One big example of this is that she doesn't seem to take much personal responsibility at all for Mercer's death. She also agrees with Ty and he helps her expose the bosses, but continues on to lead the world into full 'Big Brother' 'openness' without a thought as to the valid privacy concerns brought up by so, so many people, including her own love ones. And the director tries to play her off as the victim/ the heroine of the flick? I don't think so. I hadn't read the book, but in reading articles about the movie afterward, I was shocked to learn that the book had the exact ending that my mind was searching for as I watched the credits. Mae is not a good person. Mae is a brainwashed, corporate drone. And that's how she is written in the book. In those same articles, the director advises that he believes that he has captured the essence of the novel. Except.. what if the essence of the novel wasn't about privacy, globalization, and the technological world, as much as it was about the human condition, and about how easily it is for someone with good intentions to accomplish something very bad, completely unawares as to the damage they are causing?It is unfortunate that isn't the movie they filmed, because I think the world has had enough happy endings and optimistic futures. Ironically, that's the Kool-aid that we have all been drinking for a very, very long time. Maybe now, now when scientists say that we only have so much time left to save the environment, when presidents can pick fights with missile-hoarding sociopaths on Twitter, and when people vote with their eyes glued to their own pocketbooks... maybe now is when the world needs to start seeing the bad endings, seeing the possible affects of their own potential actions played out on screen, right in front of their eyes.

I just saw this film on TV - so glad I did not pay for it. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it does evoke thought provoking questions. However, the ending is totally unrealistic and I suggest another here.In this film Mae (Emma Watson) gets a job at a high-tech company (aka Facebook, Google, etc.) then discovers it keeps massive amounts of data on everyone including miniscule cameras set up all over. The CEO (Tom Hanks) believes everyone should know everything about everyone.During the course of her corporate rise Mae joins with him in creating an international network that can find anyone. First they try it on a criminal and then on a lost friend of hers. The boy freaks out at having people chasing him with their cell phones recording and a camera drone chasing him. He tries to get away in his truck and has a fatal accident due to being distracted by the drone.In the film Mae goes ""off grid"" for only four days. (Reality check - people carry guilt for accidents like this for the rest of their lives.) She then goes back to work and causes a total reveal of all the CEO's data along with his top aide. This screws him professionally and she takes over.REALITY CHECKS NEEDED HERE! First, after the boys death there would be a criminal investigation. The boys parents would sue everyone involved for Wrongful Death and anything else their lawyer would suggest. In addition, the police would bring Manslaughter charges against them all.The realistic ending would be that as Mae is led off to prison she (in voiceover) sees her mistake and realizes that sometimes people should be left to keep their secrets; secrets are not always lies as she had stated.

This is not Mae's coming of age story as she rebels against Evil Corp--if that is your expectation, you will be disappointed. The story, as I take it, is about Mae's coming to terms, fully coming to terms, with a world where we are all transparent; and it is about the viewer also needing to come to terms with that. The bosses of the Circle are not villains, and even their hypocrisy is understandable. There is no hiding; all of us have to learn to bear scrutiny. Those 'off the grid' are destroyed, and even the gung-ho supporters of the company, aside from Ty and Mae, don't see the consequences of what The Circle is about.

Tom Hanks as always, portrayed his character  superbly. He expressed his characters business and entrepreneurial  skills in a way which echoed those of the great, late Steve Jobs. This  film takes us into a stark reality of the future we are rapidly heading  into and explores the potential of technology and how it impacts our  behavior and that of the people around us.

Basically it is a boring, creepy ride through the mindset of some of the millennial generation who seem to think their entire lives are something everyone wants to see.The movie had potential to truly address the issues of privacy in a digital, online age. But it falls very flat. Basically you are left hanging and it seems that the movie actually endorses the ""transparent"" lifestyle. It seems to push two main points that I want to refute.1. The idea that your life experiences must be shared with the world at large. Seriously? I can think of so many ways where this can go wrong. First of all it is simply not true. No one is entitled to my life except me. If you want my life experiences, go get them. Also, watching a video of someone's life is not sharing their life experience. At best it is voyeurism.2. ""Secrets are lies."" This is pushed about halfway through the movie. At first I thought it was going to be the hook used to draw the antagonist into the issues of privacy. But it never gets used that way in any effective manner. The statement is obviously over-generalized and patently untrue.I also want to spend a little time on character of Mae, played by Emma Watson. She is the smartest dumb person I have seen in a movie in a long time. She starts out ok and you kind of like her until she starts spouting out the company BS. At first you think she is going to wake up and realize that invading people's privacy is wrong but she never does even when her childhood friend dies because of it. Watson's portrayal is bland at best. She's not all that likable and can't quite seem to completely cover her British accent. With her character's parents portrayed as down-home folks, she comes across as aristocratic. Maybe that was the intent but it does not make for a character you can get behind.",The Circle

The movies point seems to be that everyone should have everything in the open? Rather than make the point that privacy is good.Finally, I really dislike movies and people whining about privacy when they voluntarily turn their information over to Google. There are many search and email platforms. And no one tells you on Facebook to post new photos everyday or where you went out to eat last night. The cognitive dissonance of people these days is insane. You literally share every detail on social media and then have the nerve to complain about privacy. While at the same time not realizing that you're the one sharing all that information. The whole premise of Google is evil makes little sense.I do agree, that the future could be cause for concern if Google does something similar to this but there is no evidence of that. I think, we need to all be more careful online and rely less on social media for socialization. The world then would be better and the movie fails to make that point. Instead, the movie really embraces the destructive forces of our current society as noted by the end. The payoff in the movie is somehow showing that if we new everything about the leaders of Google/Other tech co's then its okay if they know everything about us.",The Circle

There's only one major flaw in this film, defining all its problems - it's just too short for the proposed contents - and, unfortunately, there was no way to make it work any better in this format.
I never read the original book, and maybe I should - one thing that I've learned from this film is that the book is probably nothing short of a great reading. Unfortunately, as mentioned already, format of a movie theater film may never physically fit all the plot, drama and revelations that the book apparently had. I still revere the filmmakers for what they were able to do - fitting that many of the ideas and images of looming great new world into this short amount of screentime, in more or less sane order. Most probably, the book has enough material to fill a whole season or two of a well-made serial, totally worth watching... it feels like a lost TV opportunity - I can only guess that a short-term movie format gains took over, whatever they were.
I shall say, that for me it was probably easier to recognize the essence behind the brief schematics that this film largely creates, as I am well acquainted with the tech world of Silicon Valley and understand much of what it's about - and what it's not. The film posts many more questions rather than suggesting definitive answers, and to me it's a strong pont, prompting users to start thinking for themselves... though, apparently, not many are capable of that anymore. 
My only wish here is that the filmmakers would unfold this film into full-fledged serial with the same actors - in my view, it would undoubtedly have a killer success on TV, also gaining much larger auditorium, thus having much larger impact on people's understanding of what we are heading into.",The Circle

Now I'm reading many poor reviews and wondering why?This film won't set your world on fire or win an Oscar for best actress etc, but the message is compelling. Taking a spin on how much data we give away to companies like Google, Amazon or Apple, The Circle focuses on privacy and our right to it, or lack of rights to it, in modern society.The interesting take from this is that my children and I have differing views on the value of sharing on social media; after watching the film the 14 year old was a lot more aware of the issues around making our lives so public.This film doesn't deserve an Oscar, but it does deserve better reviews than it has received. Sure, you can pick holes in some of the plot, but its message is strong. It was fantastic to watch Tom Hanks in a role not based on a true story, with a hint of menace to his character.

However, this is NOT the case with The Circle, which is quite deliberate. The whole premise is to push the story and characters over the edge in order to hammer the points home. It's deliberately exaggerated to the point of being a caricature. The (valid) point(s) are very important and THEY are indeed the lead character(s), mainly ""the lack of privacy"" -consequences.

443,arthur_blom,Great concept but with some flaws,7,17 June 2017,Great movie about the power that modern day tech companies can acquire and put that power to bad use while fooling us to believe it's all for the greater good. The acting was good overall but a special mention must go out to Tom Hanks. His portrayal of Bailey was very convincing as a seemingly benevolent boss of a tech giant while have quite some skeletons in his closet (even though we as an audience never discover exactly what those skeletons are). The character of Ty was a bit flawed in my opinion. Hardly any screen time and for someone who has lost faith in the company and doesn't trust his co-founders he surely puts a lot of faith in a new employee who he barely knows. Also in the end Mae gets the idea to reveal the truth about the founders of the company and needs Ty's help to accomplish this. Why didn't Ty do this on his own much sooner as he was clearly not happy with the company (and side tracked by Bailey and Stenton) for a while already. Revealing all secret emails and chats is something only Ty was able to do in the first place so it's weird Mae had to come up with the idea first. On top of that it was also a little odd that Bailey and Stenton wrote emails which showed their dark sides. Mae was introduced to the private meeting room of Bailey and Stanton where they discussed things only Bailey and Stanton should know about. The room was clear of tech. It was full of books and looked a bit like an old fashioned study but there were no laptops/tablets. The scene where this room was showed and explained what it was for implicated that Bailey and Stanton may be creators of tech but were also aware that everything you do online can be used against you (hence the tech free meeting room). So while being careful on one hand and be so careless at the same time felt a bit odd to me. Still the concept is great and it gives everybody something to think about.

I read some of the reviews so I wasn't expecting too much, but it was even worse than I had thought it would be. The writing was utterly terrible, the plot was poorly done, and even the acting was only decent, a surprising result considering the well-known cast. The overall concept of The Circle initially sounds interesting, but when explored in depth and presented through the film, multiple flaws can be found and at times, it almost seems ""stupid"". As the movie progresses, the main character's choices and actions seem contradictory to how she was introduced, and it becomes hard for the audience to relate to her and put themselves in her shoes. By the end of the movie, it became quite clear that The Circle had hoped to offer some profound social commentary on technology and human behaviour, but ultimately failed to do so by creating such a predictable and ""cheesy"" film. The dialogue was almost laughable at times, and there wasn't a single character that felt complex or real. While somewhat entertaining due to the futuristic depictions of technology and fast-paced plot, The Circle offers little more than that. Rather than provoke discussion or any deep thoughts after viewing, it leaves you with a large sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the way in which the writing and the story were carried out, as well as frustration with the immense amount of plot holes and motive flaws. Overall, The Circle tries to make a name for itself amongst the many ""dangers of technology"" movies, but as always, lazy writing and a poor and predictable plot can only lead to the disappointing result it ends up being.

464,maxswurm,"Like walking around in circles, but in an okay way.",7,27 August 2017,"The Circle is an adaptation of the 2013 novel by Dave Eggers - it is a dystopian analysis of modern society seen through the eyes of Mae Holland, a budding young tech employee, Mae Holland, who has just landed herself a job at The Circle.As a fan of the original novel, when I saw the trailer for The Circle I was very excited. When I saw the bad reviews it had accumulated, I was very much disheartened. After finally having seen the movie, I would say that I'm somewhere in between.Despite being slow paced, somewhat clumsy and at times boring, I do believe that this is a movie worth watching. It brings something that the book does not, which is a rich visualisation of a future where accountability is taken way too far and privacy is thrown out the window.My favourite thing about The Circle is that it is, in my opinion, realistic. The way the technology is presented by Eamon Bailey is not unlike something you would see today. It's over the top - there's no doubt about that - but believable.In addition, the film does a great job of illustrating with subtlety the way in which the Circle is taking over the world. There are one or two scenes which are not subtle whatsoever, but there are also some really good scenes, along with some little hints and nudges that accumulate to form a very unique tone. Moreover, the ending is excellent in my opinion, and leaves the viewer to decide about the future of Mae and The Circle.The Circle is not at all without flaws. In particular, the story is quite different to Eggers' original narrative, which, in some respects, I believe to be the film's main weakness.SPOILER WARNING!!! The decision to have Ty reveal himself half way through the movie was frankly idiotic - it had no bearing whatsoever on the story until the very end scene, in which he failed to make an actual appearance (yeah he was seen beforehand, fight me). The narrative of the film feels tepid at best, and there are a multitude of ways Ty's character could have been used more effectively to lessen that feeling. END SPOILERS I GUESS!!! The film does not seem to be going anywhere (one might say it's a bit like walking around in circ-yeah we get it) most of the time, which I think is both positive and negative. The way I see it, there are certain things the film wants to present, and so it presents them, with a story around it. The overall narrative is not as imperative as it was in the novel, which I think is a respectable decision, it just makes for less entertaining cinema.Overall, I'm pleased with The Circle. It was better than I expected, given the bad reviews it received, and it had some powerful ideas that were illustrated well. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how well the novel was translated onto the big screen; 2 hours is not a lot of time to tell everything there is to tell about this story, and I was impressed that instead of rushing the full story, a slightly altered one was told in its entirety. I've seen a lot of movies where the plot is rushed, and they are much, much worse than this.I think that if you went to see this movie with an open mind, you would come away with a thought or two about technology and privacy in the world we live in. If you enjoyed it, I highly recommend reading the book by Dave Eggers; in some ways it is a completely different story, and certainly a different experience.",The Circle
465,postanelmar,Emma Watson failing to give life to a mediocre written script,3,22 August 2017,"I did not read the book, but, as a discussion with people who did showed, it would have at least helped me to understand, where the movie was heading to. Short plot summary: Mae, played by Emma Watson, daughter of a loving couple, gets a job at the ""Circle"", an equivalent of Google/Apple/Facebook/takeyourpick-tech-giant, thanks to the introduction of a good friend. After that, a clicheed story of ""privacy versus oversharing on social media versus big data"" ensues. We have all the relevant characters: the friend, who does not want any part of this Social-Media-thing (and is threatened and shunned by others), the bosses who preach transparency - but do not adhere to it themselves and Mae - a young, intelligent girl, who is falling for the credos of the ""Circle"". So far, not too bad. But the movie fails to portray a consistent story line. Side-characters like her friend Annie and the original founder of the Circle, Ty, get lost in the movie. Annie for instance changes abruptly from the all- time-cheery companion who shares the opinion of the company to a burnt-out woman, who appears envious of Maes success and then leaves for Scotland to abdictate technology. Ty, who is first described as ""mysteriously lost"" by the papers, turns out to have been offered a kind of ""creative free mind""-job by the bosses instead. In contrast to the book, his only role in the movie is to show Mae where all the data is stored and then to release all data from the two bosses to everyone. Its not even clear, what the plot wants Mae to be: The heroine, who exposes the superficialness of the two bosses?Or a tech-maniac who decides to turn to the dark side? Or is it just the prequel for a second part - since the end scene shows her in a cayak - thus returning to nature and her ""origins""?

The beginning was as enticing as the mundane features that capitulated the audience; at least for the preliminary hour. The sub-structure of this film reminded me of the rhetoric of the ""Disfruita"" scene in Duck Season...I have properly labeled this striking parallel to The Circle for a various amount of reasons. First, The Circle was automatonic. Second, The Circle was auditory. Thirdly, The Circle was astounding. As with the Black and White features of Duck Season; the overall stability of the mechanized ""pelicula nueva"" deemed relevant the wide (positivity) ""mundo"" that encapsulates the audience. The delivery that the actors and actresses unveiled substantiated ""la verdad"" that most mimics the opening scene of The Circle. The colors and use of visual ""real-world"" cinematography escalated the emotions that carried The Circle to a necessary height; broadening the senses of the onlooker. As with the plot development of Duck Season; The Circle was quite a recollection of the inner thoughts of that under-fortiduous scene; whereby ""una mujer primitiva"" encounters ""un hombre primitivo"".

I work in technology so I may have too much of an analytical approach to enjoy this movie to the fullest.We are already living in a society where people are too willing to forfeit privacy. However, taken to an extreme as this movie does, it is not even conceivable that someone would volunteer for complete transparency except to make money. Even the reality shows do a lot of editing and yes, they may follow one person for a while. The act of tracking even one person takes more than one person's time. The amount of effort and storage to record everything from what would be billions of cameras and then have even enough bodies to review data or even flag video with some proactive action is just unrealistic.However, the point of the movie is conveyed with moderate impact and overall people are just not that naive.

The fear of losing our privacy is certainly not unjustified, but should we become paranoid and suspicious of every innovation, and hostile towards all marketing efforts employed to persuade us of their benefits? I'm glad this movie wasn't a complicated maze of mysteries and intrigues but in fact a simple attempt to show the fine line between Utopian ambitions and Dystopian outcomes.

479,Moosen234,Unintentionally Hilarious,3,6 February 2019,"NON SPOILERS:It has a solid begin, with potentially very interesting subject matter to explore, and an amazing cast of actors (John Boyega, Tom Hanks, Emma Watson, Patton Oswalt). But oh boy does it drop the ball during the middle of the film, requiring a HUGE suspension of disbelief as to how these characters, or just any regular human beings would react to the events that occur.SPOILERS:Performances:
Perhaps this movies biggest strength is its cast and their performances, particularly Tom Hanks. Despite the dialogue itself not making sense, I can see why some people might be convinced that this obviously shady system is one that is worth it and an overall benefit to society. Emma Watson had some stand out moments, but nothing that blew me away. I only wish I saw more from John Boyega, as I feel he has a lot of potential, but didn't have the chance to show it, as he plays a minor role. Same with Patton Oswalt, but I know he would have turned in a great performance with more screen time. What we did see was again not bad but far from noteworthy.Suspension of Disbelief(here we go):
So the plot of the movie is centered around 'The Circle' a company that is slowly implementing a system of total transparency, asking people to completely sacrifice any and all privacy, and people actually do it. Some of this could be down to Tom Hank's performance, and I guess it had to be, because the points they make that this is a good system, NONE of them make any sense at all. I could help burst out laughing during these scenes, hence why I call this movie unintentionally hilarious.
Numerous times its stated that they have government support from multiple countries, in reference to their plan to create mandatory voting through their Circle profile. WHY WOULD THAT MANY COUNTRIES EVER AGREE TO THAT. EVER. It was so clearly a way for the company to take away control from governments, this just being 1 step in a long line of relinquishing control. Why didn't more people speak out about this obviously shady system? There is MANY more examples of this but you get the idea.Overall I gave this a 3/10, purely because of the performances, and the fact that I couldn't stop laughing.

The acting (or maybe the script) could've been improved, but overall I thought that they did a good job of taking a book that delves so deeply into the toxicity of social media and over-sharing online and making for a film that leaves you thinking. If you're expecting an exciting sci-fi thriller, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into it expecting a think-piece on how social media can be powerful, you may enjoy it!The book of course delves into much more detail on the psychological toll of live broadcasting all the time and social media as a whole, as well as how powerful the Circle really is (for example - framing politicians that speak against the Circle for crimes they didn't commit). However, I was a bit surprised that the movie missed out on some pivotal (IMO) moments in the book - such as Annie finding out her family's history, the character of Francis, Stenton's shark, and of course, the ending.(SPOILER:)I personally like the ending in the movie - because i love a good ""comeuppance"" and, reading the book, it's what you want to see Mae do. However, the ending in the book is much more twisted (or perhaps, disappointing): Mae returns to the Circle, and continues working there as she once had - showing how much she had transformed from being a skeptical character at the beginning of her time there, to someone who has been brainwashed by the power of the Circle (as many others have).",The Circle

Than if you would succumb to living under the big brother inspecting eye, we might lose all the little things that connected us to humanity. Tom Hanks as the founder of The Circle is great and Emma Watson as fragile and naive she actually turns to be one tough cookie who endorses the circle and becomes one of his great subjects.The script was lacking a bit, and it felt like it's repeating itself. Big shout to Bill Paxton who portrays the father with the debilitating disease of MS, who brings sensitivity to the role and what a great loss of knowing we actually lost him.

Parts like Mae's development from being a bit of a shy and mysterious person who thinks things through and is not entirely there at all times. She struggles a lot at first, being in this company with all these expactations of here being all social and a participant to all those activities. You coul feel what happens to someone, who is suppose to be there all the time and social an everything. I felt a lot of anger and annoyance while reading the book and in the movie it seemend all oh so nice and fine. I hate that they left all of that out. Also mercer, what kind of a weird development is that in the movie? Mae literally hated him in the book, she was at some point so much into that community, that this was on huge sign of all the things that are going wrong there, because in the book it was so important to have the opposite site. 
In the movie they created that via that soulsearch scene, which by the way was to abruptly shown and introduced. A lot of fights, complications with people in the outside were not well shown. And that is actually a huge and important part for the big picture. But i must admit that i enjoyed the ending in the movie more, although I get why it was different in the book. But the movie version was a bit more satisfying and I liked the scenerey and loved some of the acting,n thats why I have given that movie four stars.Its actually funny to choose this movie to post my first review, but there is a important message there and I really need to say, please read the book also!",The Circle

If such a technology were to become available, would it really turn some people into ""privacy predators"" in search of those who don't wish to be found?Probably the scariest part of the film is that it can leave you wondering just how close we might be to becoming such a society. One point that I did notice: when Emma Watson was ""playing"" Hermione in the Harry Potter films; she was really portraying Emma Watson. In the The Circle Emma played Mae like a grown up Hermione.

530,GrandMaesterOfJellyDonuts,"Heartless movie. Unreal characters, weak story, ridiculous message.",1,1 June 2017,"There is a passage in this movie that's so incredibly heartless. It turned an otherwise bad movie into something I can almost consider my enemy.The passage I speak of is when Mercer (in a totally unrealistic way, but that's beside the point) kills himself by driving off a bridge. Mae is ultimately responsible for that. We see her in bed, being sad for a little while, then she goes back to work for that abomination of a company. Sure, she plots behind the scenes to unmask the guys at the top. But that doesn't make her any less responsible for her best friend's death. Her bosses only pushed her over the edge.The movie presents Mae as a victim who turns into a victor. As if she somehow avenged her friend's death by unmasking her bosses. It made no sense at all. It was the company itself, the very idea of tracking down people who don't want to be found, coupled with Mae's consent to do something she knew was very wrong, that killed Mercer. A person who can feel guilty would not get anywhere near that company ever again, or burn it to the ground. Mae just looked for someone else to blame, succeeded and shamelessly climbed the ladder ""for the greater good"".It sickens me that a soulless character like this is presented as a heroine in a big picture like this. People look up to movie characters, they become role models. This one is going to do some damage.EDIT: I want to make myself a little more clear. I don't give this movie 1 star because I got nothing from it. On the contrary: this movie made me think, big time. You should definitely go see it to make up your own mind. But I stand behind my judgement. This movie made my heart bleed. The Circle is based on a very real phenomenon, loss of privacy is a real problem coming our way. But the main character does not stand against the tide, she goes with the flow and only speeds things up. Movie characters usually embody ideal behaviour, this one does what most people would do. It's a pretty unique but very irresponsible approach. It will make people feel more powerless than they already are. The movie only presents the problem, without a solution or a true hero to find one. I feel challenged to find the solution in myself, so in that way the movie deserves 10 stars instead of 1.

As for law enforcement subpoena powers, your bank records, tax records, you home, your car and even your private parts can be searched! This movie shows how naive we are to believe that we are safe and private business is not doing the same with our lives. Do you post online where you ate, what you ate and with whom? Guess what, businesses can ID all of that without you posting it, you cellphone GPS data is where you and those also at the same place, your credit card or Apple Pay records of what and how much, it's also time stamped.

It can't be that bad."" (Then again, 2010's ""Valentine's Day"" happened, too.) To summarize the movie in the most efficient manner, I would say it was Hollywood's lengthy and failed attempt at a ""Black Mirror"" episode. Looking back on this movie, my favorite part is an exchange between our protagonist (?) Mae and her interviewer for her dream job. He's putting her through a lightning round of opinion-based questions, and asks, ""What's your biggest fear?"" We cut to an extreme close up (Oh boy! She's about to say something profound!), she pauses, and then replies, ""Unfulfilled potential."" (Nailed it. Great answer. You've got the job.) Now I laugh, however, because that entire film was 2 hours of unfulfilled acting potential. They're good actors, but the dialogue, written in part by novelist Dave Eggers, was corny and ejected me from the world of participation in the film right back into mere viewership. Parts of this movie were mildly entertaining, and if you still want to go see it, by all means do so.

Emma Watson plays a hollow character, and her character growth seems very artificial.My recommendation to everyone is to skip this and go watch Black Mirror if by some chance you already haven't.

Don't waste your evening.The Circle is the most discombobulated book-to-movie I have ever seen. It's about as tasteless as you can get. Exhausting each and every category on CustomInk does not allow a free pass to utterly waste the audience's time.The Circle unapologetically quotes the text in order to remind everyone that ""hey, this was from a book."" I will give the screenplay the benefit of the doubt. Directors/Writers sometimes change certain aspects of the story to ""put their own spin on things"" - chef's choice. You sometimes need to rearrange the story in order for it to fit your budget.
For example: the exclusion of the deep sea creatures is an understandable choice, given that recreating such effects would be expensive, I guess.
I'm not sure how much time Eggers put into the project or if Ponsoldt goofed it up. Regardless the movie is a poor reflection of the book.Students BEWARE: Do not watch this movie as an alternative to reading the book or SparkNotes for that matter.

Save yourselves, save your money, save your time and DON'T WATCH IT!Why? It is not just worthless. It is bad. Really bad. A very bad movie. Take that money, buy some ladyfingers on it and play Jenga with rescued whales instead of watching this crap. Even The Hunger Games 2 was better than this.By way of introduction, I don't like Emma Watson, nor Tom Hanks. But! I never thought they could go beyond 'don't like'. None of the characters in this movie are likable. The most I could feel was sorry for the parents who, no matter how stupid she is, still love their daughter. There is no, zero, no trace of any character development. Allll of them are stupid. Very stupid. Those who aren't, they are on drugs or have given up on their lives. And nothing changes throughout the whole movie. They alllll stay stupid. Except for Emma Watson who becomes even more stupid.So the story in a nutshell, without spoilers:Emma Watson is playing a moron who is dumb but at least diligent, so she becomes even dumber. The world presented in the movie is dumb and becomes even dumber. What about Tom Hanks? Yes, he, too... Sorry, it might be boring to read this so many times, but the film is really this bad. The feared anti-utopia in a ridiculous form. With this forced, flat story and flat characters the movie tried to give the message: 'beware, human, you have stepped on the path of stupidity', but it failed. Failed to make the audience think, failed even just to emphasize the already omnipresent warning about the dangers of social media.

Yes! This is the film. She makes silk purse out of a sow's ear, sees that it's not working, and continues. What did the director want to show? If the story is bad, the actors are bad, let the ending be bad as well?The only remarkable 2 minutes of this whole 110 minutes (feels 210) of waste of storage space are delivered by Tom Hanks at the apex, when his ever-smile fades and turns into a mixture of the signs of concealed consternation and fear - the reason of that hasn't even been founded throughout the movie, nor do we get to know in the remaining 2 minutes.-- spoiler off --The approx. 70 year old lady (free tickets you know) next to me said at the end with grumpy face 'This was worse than a diarrhea.'

It all seems a huge déjà vu: the promising and smart girl from a humble setting, a bigger-than-anyone company, a dark side (roughly shown by an under-exploited Boyega), the struggle with all of this. Being The Circle marketed as a thriller, audience is meant to be thrilled, at some point; this hardly ever happens; being marketed as a dystopian picture, The Circle certainly has some suggestive elements but fails to mix them smoothly. Its lazy effort is to take problems we are already struggling with -such as loss of privacy, invasive social media and their influence on politics, appalling need for control- and push them a little further in a not-so-far future without making a good or even consistent plot out of it, not to mention a solid message.

560,katelyndawn,So Much Potential... So Much Disappointment,2,8 July 2017,"*SPOILERS AHEAD* *Sigh* This pains me because Tom Hanks is my cinematic hero, and the celebrity I would most want to go for coffee with. I really love this man! When I watched the preview for The Circle, I thought I was going to be in for a Technological Psychological Thriller with a strong protagonist in Emma Watson, and an intriguing antagonist in Tom Hanks (playing a bad guy for once). I thought it was going to be a story of a young go-getter lead character who would start working for ""The Circle"" in order to pay for her father's health care needs, kick butt, get promoted, and accidentally stumble upon some dubious overarching monstrous plot in which The Circle was using people's information in an unlawful, terrorist type manner. Then I thought the rest of the movie was when the thriller part kicked in, as it would be a cat and mouse chase between Emma Watson VS Tom Hanks in a race to unearth this conspiracy. Meanwhile, she would have obstacles along the way, growing her character so she would end up being a better, stronger and a more ethical person at the end compared to the beginning. Unfortunately... this movie fell horribly flat. She ends up becoming less and less loyal to her family, her character is totally corrupted throughout the film, and never regains much of a moral compass, she totally drinks the kool-aid, and the attempt to ""out"" Tom Hanks at the last minute of the movie is followed by her on a kayak in the San Francisco Bay with the ever present cameras and media surrounding her as she looks as happy as a clam that technology is still following her every moment. We don't know what happens to Tom Hanks, her family, and she doesn't seem to show any remorse (aside from a short 4-day mourning break) after she kills her best friend. What does she learn? I don't know, the movie just ends abruptly seeming to have achieved nothing and changed nothing. Is there a big showdown between her and Tom Hanks? Nope... she just makes his emails public and then that part is just over... Does she beat the monster that is The Circle and end this insane technological invasion?

This was something, distractedly so, that I contemplated for a good part of the film. I, however, grew to accept this decision as I witnessed Watson's character, Mae Holland, fall into the chameleon ways of the collective. An actress so well recognized as English, playing an American, worked to reinforce the character's ""fakeness"". Being ""fake"" is not a new concept that only pertains to millennials, people have been doing it to get ahead in the world for ages. What matters is the degree to which modern technology has magnified our perception of ourselves through others. It is no longer about trying to impress your new group of friends, but trying to impress everyone on social media. I have definitely experienced individuals obsessed with their online persona, caring more about likes and gaining followers than those immediately in there presence. It is an all too real thing that you probably have witnessed first hand if you are a millennial.The social media employees pressuring Mae to be more active in The Circle is a great scene that leads us into what Mae becomes. They almost spell it out for us when they note that her lack of communication examples a lack of self worth- those are usually the individuals who become most absorbed by gaining that self worth through the internet. I'm using up all my words here, so I'll end with less detail. I like how the scene with Mercer channels a sort of WorldstarHipHop feel. The over-saturation of technology has dehumanized individuals. WorldstarHipHop, I feel, is known more for videos of fights where individuals take entertainment in watching something horrible happen rather than breaking it up. It's the same sort of sentiment though, taking pleasure in something that morally shouldn't be. I like that Circle and True You brings everything together just like Apple, Facebook, Google, etc. I mean, you can practically sign up for anything nowadays with one of those accounts. I dislike the death of Mercer. As cheesy and Hollywood as it may be, it would work better if Mae & Mercer were romantically tied. There is just no emotional tie between the audience and Mercer, rendering his death less effective. Overall- I did find myself particularly sympathetic with the feeling of technology, specifically social media, intruding in not only our privacy, but also ruining our relationships. I think social media can be used properly, but also can lead to the worsening of society. It really is a modern day disorder...",The Circle

One reason why I was so into the trailer, is because it reminded me of the movie Snowden that came out in 2016. Portraying Edward Snowden. It reminded me of that film because The Circle is basically doing the same thing to a degree of what Edward Snowden found out what the N.S.A. was doing while he worked for them.

But that's oversimplified and misleading.",3,29 November 2017,"I think I read into the subtext and implications before seeing the more obvious meaning behind the movie. And since making this post, I've actually had time to see an argument from both sides. I'm just gonna skip straight to the end and talk about that.My first instinct upon seeing the end was ""Wait, that's where it ends?! It was just starting to get interesting!"" And the entire movie just felt like the first act to a Black Mirror episode. Not a Black Mirror episode as my mom's boyfriend and I were saying throughout the entire movie, but just the first act. Maybe the second act, but not even all of it. And I think that helped influence the message I got from it.My second instinct upon seeing the end was, ""Wait, she's actually supporting this instead of going against it or using it as a tool to take down the company?"" Which was quickly followed by, ""Is this movie saying that transparency is good?!"" (Of course, I mean transparency in the context of the movie). I thought that whole scene was meant to shut down the company and stop it dead in its tracks, not actually genuine mean what she said!I was expecting the entire point of the movie to be that this company is bad, and what they're doing is bad, and that it would be taken down, or something, by the end. But that's not what happened. Actually, the final scene (well, second to final scene, technically) just opened up so many questions and possibilities for story lines, which is why I was so surprised when it just ended after that.Anyways, All of this led me to think that this was basically CIA/NSA propaganda to show that, ""Hey, Americans! You don't need all that pesky privacy! Just get rid of all of it and become completely transparent and share literally everything you do with everyone every second of the day!"" And that's the honest impression this movie left on me.Early in the movie, there's a news clip showing a senator basically being against the company (I forget what she actually said, but it probably had to do with privacy and freedom). And I thought, ""Oh, the main characters are probably gonna be spies for her to bring down the company"" but NOPE! Instead, another news clip about 20-30 minutes later shows her being investigated for whatever and she is never seen again. And that is literally the only voice of doubt anywhere in the movie. Well, okay, that's not exactly true. Mae's parents try to get her to ditch the company and not go back to work for it, but that's slightly different. There's also Ty, who I thought said he was against everything the company was doing, but I was zoning out a little during that part, so I guess I misunderstood what he was saying, because he later helps Mae with her final plan.In the time since seeing this movie, I've had time to think about it, and I think the more obvious message is to call for transparency of politicians and CEOs, and while I can agree with that - corruption is pretty rampant these days - I do have to disagree with the movie. I'd prefer my privacy, and based off of everyone's reaction to Edward Snowden leaking what the NSA was doing, I get the feeling I'm far from alone in this department.Anyways, that's my opinion on the movie. Maybe I wildly misinterpreted it, but that's what I thought, regardless.",The Circle

As others have said, there's not a lot of depth to the characters, but the movie is clearly about the topic of the effects of too much technology in our lives. This movie is less about the characters and more about the point. If you want to know Watson's or Hank's character, then the movie will disappoint. If you want a movie about the insidious nature of technology, then this may be more up your alley.Some people have said the movie is predictable. The predictability of the movie meshes well with the point the movie is making. Everyone is looking for depth, but missing the obvious. Ever heard the saying, ""Can't see the forest for the trees""? Technology is seeping into every aspect of our lives to the point where we are offering up our privacy for convenience and a few cheap thrills. People worry about Big Brother, but give up personal data on Facebook and through Google and Amazon products and services. More data is available to the public than you may realize, even when you ""up"" your privacy settings. Since these companies have access to ALL of your data, imagine what they have figured out about you. This movie touches on those points and the pressure people are subjected to to participate in the sharing of one's personal information to be a part of the circle, or worse yet, the inner circle - the ultimate in over-divulging of your personal info. People need privacy. To expose everything is inhuman and not congruent with any species on this planet.Some of the reviews here reveal how young the reviewers are. If some of these people were aware of George Orwell, Soylant Green (mentioned in the film, though I suspect not followed-up on by the reviewers), and even some early 90's ""corporations run the world""-sci-fi films, they would probably appreciate the prophetic nature of this film as it is a modern day continuation of the theme.

The problem with ""The Circle"" is (not surprisingly) that the screenwriters and directory really have no solution on how to resolve this problem. Specifically, ""old farts"" and ""youngster millenials"" respond differently to it. Seniors clearly recognize that the notion of and maintenance of privacy is more important than access, while most youngsters (excluding ""weirdos"" such as Mercer) clearly care relatively little about privacy in comparison to (paid-for) access. However, because we as human beings all (at some point) do things that we would rather forget, the importance of privacy and secrets increases with age, and so millenials, even just a few years later and older, eventually want to have some privacy. Nonetheless, business- and capitalism-focused American and Western society, which focuses so heavily on YOUNG people (who buy more things than older people), cleaves to access over privacy. Deep-seated youngster souls such as Ty don't need the accumulation of age to recognize the need for privacy, but fundamentally, the problem described by this movie is most strongly felt in the generational divide.The path taken by Mae - exposing Baily and Stenton but at the same time embracing full transparency-- thus strikes all of us as somehow a cop-out, which it is, at the same time providing no explanation and basis for her choices.",The Circle

The producers, casting crew and director have clearly not read the novel or decided to just completely ignore it after reading.I have read a lot of books and watched a lot of films therefore I can say that this is by far the most dreadful film I have ever watched. A total waste of time. Do not watch this unless you want to confirm what you have just read! The book is equally awful.The more I think about this film and the book the worse it gets. The lack of correlation is astounding. Imagine reading the Harry Potter novels and then in the films Ron was missing/never introduced. This is what The Circle has achieved, the film makes no sense compared to the book.",The Circle
