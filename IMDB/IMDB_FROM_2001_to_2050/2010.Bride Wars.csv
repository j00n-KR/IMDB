0,TheLittleSongbird,"I tried to like it, but it just doesn't work",2,31 March 2011,"I have no problem with romantic comedies and chick-flicks when they are done right. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like Bride Wars, apart from some striking filming and a beguiling soundtrack, it doesn't work.What was it that didn't work? The story was one definite flaw, it was very uninteresting and predictable. The characters are shallow and despite a talented cast I felt indifferent to every character that came across the screens. I also didn't like how some of the characters are treated, not that it was sexist or anything like that, but Bride Wars when it comes to the writing pretty much shrugs its characters off as though they are just little ornaments, well no characters in movies are quite important. The pace starts off well, but slackens quickly so the romantic elements especially are filled with tedium.Which brings me to the writing. In my opinion, Bride Wars' biggest failing. It aims to be funny and romantic, it succeeds at neither sadly. The comedy elements are mean-spirited and unfunny and the romantic elements are frothy and slushy. The direction in my view is rather slack, and I didn't think much of the acting. Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway are lovely women and both try their best with poorly developed characters but when it comes to the chemistry it never catches fire, and in more ways than one I blame the script and direction for that. The supporting cast range from so-so to pretty poor.Overall, had potential and I wanted to like it, but because it was so badly written I couldn't even enjoy it. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Bride Wars
1,SnoopyStyle,"Love the friendship, so I like the movie for the first 20 minutes",4,7 December 2013,"Live (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) are best friends and want to be the maid of honor in each other's wedding. However a scheduling mistake places both their weddings on the same date in the same place. They go nuts, and chaos ensues.I love the best friend chemistry between Hudson and Hathaway. The problem is that the structure of the movie has them separated and hating each other. It's a lousy message, and it makes for a sad watch. It makes these women petty little children of the worst kind. And the worst sin of all, it makes them not funny. People behaving badly can be funny, but just not here. Chris Pratt is actually playing somebody reasonable which makes the final twist very weird. It's not properly set up. There are too many things wrong with this movie.",Bride Wars
2,claudio_carvalho,Mediocre and Corny Silliness,3,18 May 2009,"In Manhattan, the lawyer Liv (Kate Hudson) and the school teacher Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since their childhood. They both are proposed by their boyfriends on the same day and they plan their wedding parties in Plaza Hotel, using the services of the famous Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen). However, due to a mistake of Marion's secretary, their weddings are scheduled for the same day. None of them accepts to change the date and they become enemies, trying to sabotage the wedding party of the rival.The deceptive ""Bride Wars"" is a mediocre and corny silliness. The predictable screenplay is imbecile and never funny, and wastes the talented Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson in ridiculous roles. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Noivas em Guerra"" (""Brides in War"")",Bride Wars
3,kosmasp,Not as silly as you might think it is,5,10 December 2009,"Depending if you thought, that this would be quite silly throughout, you might be delighted or not. While it is as realistic as it can be for a comedy that involves weddings and two best friends. Plus you do have two of the best females of their generations. Anne Hatheway having the edge, but that doesn't matter.While I liked the fact, that it tried to be as real as it could, I'm sure some people would have loved to see more craziness, something that was hinted at, in the trailer. Still pretty enjoyable and fun to watch, while quite predictable, this is a movie you can watch, without being ashamed.",Bride Wars
4,jboothmillard,Bride Wars,3,30 June 2011,"I had heard from many sources, including Robert Webb on Great Movie Mistakes, that this film was something you wish you hadn't watched, so I had to see why, from director Gary Winick (13 Going on 30, Charlotte's Web). Basically in Manhattan, New York, best friends since school, lawyer Olivia 'Liv' Lerner (Kate Hudson) and school teacher Emma Allan (Anne Hathaway), are both proposed to by their boyfriends on the same day, but their is a little competition. They are competing as to who got the proposal first, and then they find out that they are both having their ceremonies and parties at the Plaza Hotel with service provided by famous wedding planner Marion St. Claire (Razzie nominated Candice Bergen). Most significantly, due to a secretarial mistake, they have both has their weddings scheduled on the same day and time, and they are both refusing to reschedule, and so begins a hostility between each other. High jealousy enraging both ladies, they begin purposely ruining their preparations for the wedding days, such as causing an overly orange tan, dying hair blue, making them gain weight stopping them fitting into a dress and out-dancing each other. All of this is sabotaging friendship between Liv and Emma, Liv's fiancé Daniel Williams (Steve Howey) may be a little uncomfortable about the situation between the women, and Emma is seeing a different controlling side to fiancé Fletcher Flemson (Chris Pratt). The friends have caused such a rift between each other that they realise they have ruined what they used to have, and they both long to put things right before their big days. They have a quick talk before the ceremonies, but Liv does not realise that, what was originally meant to be intentional, a DVD of happy memories of Emma has been swapped for overly embarrassing drunken behaviour, and they have a quick fight. This forces Emma to finally admit that Fletcher might not be the right man for her after all, but she and Liv make up, and the remaining bride marries happily. The ending sees Liv and Emma the best of friends again reuniting a year or two later, and they both receive the great news that they are pregnant, and obviously they find out they are due on the same day. Also starring Kristen Johnston as Deb, Bryan Greenberg as Nate Lerner, Michael Arden as Kevin, Victor Slezak as Colson, Casey Wilson as Stacy, John Pankow as John Allan and Kelly Coffield Park as Kathy. Hudson and Hathaway both are equally appealing and of course bitchy as each other, their dastardly antics to one another obviously make up most of the gags, many of them do work reasonably, but you just get the sense that they are a little too over the top, and not enough thought has gone into the actual story, and the pacing can be uneven, a not brilliant comedy. Adequate!",Bride Wars
5,blanche-2,Silly,6,16 June 2009,"Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson are in the ""Bride Wars"" in this 2009 comedy about two best friends who, due to a scheduling mistake, end up with the same date for their wedding. They agree one has to give up the date; but each finds out from someone else that the other is doing save the date cards or something, and they turn on one another. It becomes a goal for each woman to destroy the other's wedding.This film is really for young girls, or so it seemed to me. It's funny in a silly kind of way. I frankly thought Hudson seemed older than Hathaway (she is, but only by three years).Candace Bergen plays a popular wedding planner, and it's always great to see her. Loved seeing the locations around Central Park and the Plaza.Okay.",Bride Wars
6,sunwarrior13,A Chic Flick And Nothing More,4,28 February 2015,"Liv and Emma are best friends who since childhood have planned every detail of their respective weddings.But a clerical error led to them to complicated events in this romantic comedy entitled,Bride Wars.The film stars Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway together with Candice Bergen, Bryan Greenberg, Chris Pratt, Steve Howey and Kristen Johnston. Liv and Emma have planned everything for their respective weddings from their ""must have"" list that includes like the New York's ultimate bridal destination and the Plaza Hotel. They are both 26 years old and are scheduled to get married to live happily ever after. But a clerical error causes a clash in wedding dates instead as both are to be married in the same date.Liv, a successful lawyer who is used to getting what she wants, including the perfect job and the perfect man, won't settle for anything less than the perfect wedding she has dreamed of for years.As for Emma, a schoolteacher who has always been good at taking care of others, but not so much in looking after herself, discovers her inner Bridezilla and comes out swinging when her own dream wedding is imperiled. Now, the two best friends who'd do anything for each other, find themselves in a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners struggle that threatens to erupt into all-out wedding war.Too bad that both Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway does not provide anything worthwhile nor memorable in this vehicle except catfights that barely elicits any laughter nor humor.It was basically bland,unimaginative and lacks creativity.But anyone who loves a chic flick will surely enjoy this movie especially fans of the lead actresses and those who love bridal gowns and wedding dresses.",Bride Wars
7,studioAT,"A nice film, with two nasty main characters",3,4 August 2017,"With a good director in Gary Winick and two big stars in the leads (Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway) this film should have been great.And to be fair it has it's moments, but about half way in the whole friendship of the girls is thrown away and they resort to doing very silly things.While its lovely to see these two glamorous women do lots of slapstick and physical comedy (maybe the reason they both signed on to do this film), the film has such a thin premise that it runs out of steam quickly.A shame, this could've been great.",Bride Wars
8,dbborroughs,For women only,5,19 January 2009,"Two women, friends since childhood and both wanting to be married at the Plaza, become enemies of a sort when both get engaged at the same time and angle for the same wedding at the same place. I'm clearly not the audience for this. I really can't say if its worth seeing as a result. I'm sure if I was a woman I probably would have liked this better, but I'm not so I didn't. I thought some of it was funny but I found it too artificial and superficial (It didn't help I didn't like the women). If you're a woman I'd give it a shot. If you're not I'd probably give it a pass. (And when did Kate Hudson start to look so old and artificial?) 5 out of 10",Bride Wars
9,Boba_Fett1138,Not a bad movie within its genre.,6,16 May 2009,"Well, yes this movie foremost is a real chick-flick but for a movie within its genre it's simply not bad. It's a movie that serves its purpose and is simply good and enjoyable for the right audience.Of course the movie is pretty simplistic with its story and all but this is fitting for the genre. Also the fact that everything is so terribly predictable of course also suits the movie just fine. As far as genre movies like this go; there are far worse movies to watch out there.It's a movie that relies mostly on its main concept and sticks to it right till the end. The concept is simple but enjoyable when two best friends through an administrative mistake are getting married on the same day. They start to battle each other when they each want to perfect wedding day for themselves. It provides the movie with a couple of nice- and comical moments.All in all the movie is quite enjoyable to watch, perhaps thanks to the very same fact that the movie is being so simplistic and predictable.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bride Wars
10,anaconda-40658,"More Like ""Bribe Wars""",2,24 April 2015,"Bride Wars (2009): Dir: Gary Winick / Cast: Anne Hathaway, Kate Hudson, Kristen Johnston, Candace Bergen, Chris Pratt: Idiotic romantic comedy about the ugliness of beauty. Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson play life long best friends whom get engaged and schedule June weddings until a screw up leaves only one opening. This threatens their friendship causing tension and revenge. Totally contrived dog show directed by Gary Winick who has made far better films than this such as Charlotte's Web and 13 Going on 30. Perhaps Charlotte didn't spin a big enough message to warn Winick away from this project. Hathaway and Hudson bicker and scheme before they predictably kiss and make up. Why are we suppose to care? Is the June wedding really that important? Aren't there other months that will do? There are eleven other months so certainly some place on the calendar can hold a wedding. Millions go on every year and not necessarily in June, so perhaps these two airheads can take a clue. Kristen Johnston and Candace Bergen appear in lifeless supporting roles. In fact Bergen is the deliverer of the bad news mix-up on wedding dates. Chris Pratt plays one of the fiancés and the role is about as interesting as reading the phone book. The film is ultimately phony with everyone acting like a total moron. This film fails even on the comedic level and should be used as target practise. Score: 2 / 10",Bride Wars
11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Bride Wars,6,24 January 2009,"Anne Hathaway rules the screens this month in Singapore, with three movies hitting the screens - Rachel Getting Married, Passengers, and now teaming up with Kate Hudson for my second wedding theme movie of the day, Bride Wars. Alas this film by director Gary Winick had the trailer to thank for in letting every cat out of the bag that there's little surprise left when the girls have a go at each other.Liv (Hudson) and Emma (Hathaway) are best friends since young, where they were subconsciously programmed that they must be each other's maid of honour, as well as to have their weddings at New York's swanky The Plaza in June. Fast forward to today, and they are on the cusp of their engagements, which of course meant that they do get to finally turn their long held dreams into reality. From being girly about attending each other's events to engaging one of the finest wedding planners ever, Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen), little do they know a small administrative screw up will threaten their very friendship.One wonders if girls can indeed be so petty over such little details. You see, the entire plot hinges on this very fine condition that the two girls hold onto, and that is to be each other's maid of honour. Which doesn't make sense because they can each have their wedding on the same day and at the same venue (different ballrooms of course), but because of their insistence to be present at their best friend's wedding, they fall out, insult each other, and declare war.So only if you buy that wee bit of irrationality (OK, so some claim that the opposite sex can get unreasonable from time to time...) do you buy into the entire bickering, where they go one up against the other, sabotaging plans to be at their best come their wedding day. It also helps that the demeanour of the girls are on opposite sides of the spectrum, with Liv being the alpha-female go-getter who doesn't take no for an answer, and Emma the good natured sweetheart. Of course the series of back-biting do change their characters both for the worse and for the better. Best friends can become your worst enemies since they know every dirty little secret you had confided in them before, and can exploit your very weakness to gain an advantage, so one can find it easy to identify with the predicament of both sides.Those who suffer will nonetheless be the common friends, who have to sit on the fence and not take sides. The trailer has spelt out the storyline and laid out the best jokes on the table, so unless you're really hard up for jokes that you know the punchline to, this may be just an average chick flick. Having it rated PG (instead of the original NC-16) also meant that some of the more coarse dialogue in Marion St. Claire's meeting with the girls, get chopped off quite abruptly.",Bride Wars
12,Smells_Like_Cheese,...And girls wonder why men think we're stupid,2,4 June 2009,"Ah, chick flicks, gotta love them, their non-clever formula's and clichés are always a joy to watch. OK, I'm being a little mean, it's all good, we do have some good chick flicks and from the moment I saw Bride Wars, I thought it looked promising. Sure, there are a lot of great conclusions that you come to when you see what the movie is about, two best friends who are scheduled to marry the same day, from: they're best friends who can't compromise? They could technically sue the company that mixed their dates up or even get it fixed if that company wanted to stay in business. But I just kept thinking, this is a movie, it could be a funny one if I let go. We do need movies like that that just escape reality, so I rented it the other day and I really couldn't escape how silly and over the top this movie was.Emma and Liv are best friends who have planned every detail of their weddings since they first witnessed a wedding at the Plaza Hotel. The two women get engaged. They then schedule their weddings with New York's most famous wedding planner, but due to a clerical error they're scheduled to have a wedding on the same day. A week of passive aggressive hostility passes before the two women make it clear that neither will compromise, especially after Liv tries to take advantage of Emma's passive nature and outrages Emma in the process. The women both attempt to sabotage the other's wedding, including Liv making Emma's tan turn bright orange, Emma tampering with Liv's hair dye to make it turn Liv's hair blue-white, Emma showing up to Liv's bachelorette party to out-dance her, and Emma secretly sending Liv chocolate and lollies to make her not fit into her dress. Oh when will the madness end? Gotta love women.Now the movie does have some good laughs here and there, but they're mostly shown in the trailer. I think one of the reasons this movie disturbed me though was due to the fact that there are women like this, one's that are so beyond obsessed with their wedding they don't even realize they're getting married. Women are competitive creatures unfortunately, I'm a woman, so I know, and we go to great lengths to prove we're prettier, smarter, kinder, etc., etc., etc. I wish that women would take a step forward where this movie is just proving time and time again that we are stupid. Two best friends who should love and support each other are trying to destroy each other's weddings, I was wrong in trying to give this movie a fair chance, it's just wrong on so many levels, wither it's the morals or just the clichéd characters, I wouldn't recommend Bride Wars.2/10",Bride Wars
13,KineticSeoul,Over exaggerated mess,3,17 October 2009,"I thought the premise of this movie would suck and that they would not have much to work with and I was right. It's just a straight forward revenge film about how some stupid stuff can ruin friendships, it's just how much bad stuff a future bride can do to the other future bride and how the other girl can get back at her for it and it goes on and on. Seriously real girl cat fights are much fun to watch than this crap even if there are scenes that does have cat fighting. This film wasn't even funny, it was sort of charming at parts but is just so pathetic and insulting cause it makes girls look really immature and stupid and this is coming from a guy even if friendship between girls are way different from guys. The basic plot of the movie is 2 friends end up fighting over a wedding date and start doing bad things to each other to back off, and the screenwriter doesn't know where to go from there so the same things just keep going on with the wedding craze. And the ending is just like you would expect, typical Hollywood ending. Just go watch the trailer and you saw the whole movie, saved your safe a lot of time. The reason I give it a 3 is cause I assume there is worse movies out there, at least I hope to think so because I don't want to give this film a higher score than 3 cause this one was atrocious.3/10",Bride Wars
14,sddavis63,It Simply Doesn't Work,1,8 October 2010,"There are moments of ""cuteness"" involved in this, and a few scenes of emotion that are very obviously forced, but the main problem with this ""comedy"" is that there just isn't very much in it that's funny, and there is definitely something wrong when a comedy doesn't elicit as much as a smile the whole way through. I expected better from Ann Hathaway and Kate Hudson, quite frankly, but they never seemed particularly into this movie. The story has them as friends since childhood, with a common dream of a June wedding at the Plaza Hotel. In a remarkable coincidence they both end up engaged at the same time and they book June weddings at the Plaza Hotel with an apparently high-powered wedding planner (played by Candace Bergen) but due to a mistake by the planner, they end up scheduled for the same day. Unable (well, actually, unwilling) to compromise, they - as the title implies - go to war with each other over the date and set out to destroy each other's weddings. You would in all honesty think that something funny could be done with that, but it wasn't. It's cliché and predictable right from the start. The decision to have the movie repeatedly narrated by Bergen to advance the plot I guess didn't work at all, and the introduction of Kristen Johnson and Michael Arden as the new ""maids of honour"" added nothing to the story - and possibly detracted from it, if that's possible. To be blunt, I was bored with this almost from the moment it started.",Bride Wars
15,Robert_duder,Take the film for what it is and you'll laugh and have a good time!!,8,28 February 2009,"I honestly can't believe how serious some reviewers (most of them women) are taking Bride Wars. They are calling it feminist set back, chauvinistic and unrealistic. God forbid anyone let go of reality for a couple hours to enjoy a film especially a comedy and as a comedy, chick flick or not, a fun, hilarious, slapstick movie that anyone could enjoy. It's ridiculous to think that the movie is trying to anti-feminist or even try to stereotype anyone. Instead it's simply an amusing, slapstick ride about two best friends. My expectations for the film weren't all that high, I expected predictability and probably nothing too far from the beaten path but I was pleasantly surprised that the actors pulled off a riot of a movie and the story was watchable and not dragging. Screenplay co-writer Casey Wilson comes from Saturday Night Live which certainly helps with the comedy aspect but I think the style and character to the film is the lead actors. While neither actor really gets a lot of depth to her character they still have good solid chemistry and both are talented comediennes.Anne Hathaway has really come a long way as an actor. I instantly fell in love with her style and comedy in The Princess Diaries and have enjoyed her in a lot of other roles. She is a very talented actress but she can also let loose and just have fun and that's what her role in Bride Wars is all about. She is the more serious, down to earth of the two and although some have reviewed her character as weak I think she just shows a softer side than Hudson. Kate Hudson lets loose as the darker perhaps more mean spirited side of the two. She doesn't really go so far as to make you dislike her but she certainly isn't the more likable. Still she does a decent job but honestly I think Hathaway makes Hudson look better. Hathaway just has a style for physical comedy. Chris Pratt and Steve Howey play their significant others and I'm sure they both are decent actors but this doesn't really showcase their ability. The film focuses on the two girls. Candice Bergen could have been pretty spectacular because she is a very talented comedienne but she doesn't get a lot of screen time or character development. Kristen Johnston on the other hand is hilarious as the naive and abrasive friend to Hathaway.The key to really enjoying Bride Wars is to not take the film seriously. I mean it is a comedy and perhaps a ""chick flick"" but the film was made for a certain demographic and it works!! Hathaway and Hudson are great together and you will laugh out loud and just really enjoy the film. It is probably true that a female director might have made the film different but Gary Winick is not new to the concept having worked on female favorites like Ugly Betty and the film 13 Going On 30. I think it's ridiculous and to call a film chauvinistic because it features two women who have dreams of their wedding which happens to be a little bit old fashion perhaps? Point is guy or gal, date, or Saturday Night alone this film will make you smile. 8/10",Bride Wars
16,MLDinTN,I don't think a movie about 2 mean spirited friends....,5,19 November 2009,"is all that great. I didn't find much funny about the movie. Liv and Emma are 2 best friends that end up with their dream wedding at the plaza scheduled on the same date. Even though they are best friends, neither will give up the date, so this leads to war between the two. Emma sends Liv chocolates to try to fatten her up and she messes with her hair color. Liv changes Emma's spray on tan to orange and shows a mean video of Emma during Emma's wedding. Then after all these mean ""pranks"", Emma decides that she really doesn't want to marry her guy. This subplot almost seems to come up out of no where.Candance Bergin plays the wedding planner. But the best character was Deb, played by Kristen Johnson. She uses spineless Emma to get her to basically do everything.FINAL VERDICT: The concept sounds better than how the film turned out. I don't recommend it.",Bride Wars
17,cricketbat,Over-the-top and fairly uncomfortable to watch,3,30 August 2018,"I thought that this film would appeal to both men and women - I was wrong. This film was over-the-top and fairly uncomfortable to watch. It had a few bright spots, but even my wife didn't like it that much. Oh, and single men should NOT watch this movie - it will make them never want to get married.",Bride Wars
18,ironhorse_iv,two brides throws a smelly bouquet of doom call Bride Wars to audience,4,5 January 2013,"I think an important question to ask is - do you think women actually liked this movie, because it's seems like a lot of women don't. Oh course base on this movie, a woman's ultimate goal in life is to get marriage! It's the only thing that can validate her as a person, even if she has a successful and lucrative career! Keeping a childish dream wedding fantasy in mind into adulthood is completely healthy and not a psychosis at all! And of course after marriage all women have to look forward to is having babies! This movie definitely panders to the lowest common denominator. Popular media is obsessed with convincing people that all women care about is ""romance"" or their definition of it, getting married, having babies, and looking pretty. Things targeted to women almost always depict self-absorbed, vain, spoiled idiots who only care about getting a man and having some sort of fairy-tale wedding. Years and years of women being defined by marriage and the generations since the Genesis of feminism being raised on Disney Princesses and sexist toys. Not all women are obsessed with the perfect wedding and not all women are like the characters that the two main actress plays. Emma Allen (Anne Hathaway) and Olivia 'Liv' Lerner (Kate Hudson) are best friends whom getting marry. Olivia ""Liv"" Lerner, a successful attorney who is used to getting her way, and won't settle for anything else yet it is shown that she is supposedly protective and extremely caring of Emma. Yeah right, writers. Emma Allan, a middle school teacher slightly has a meek nature and ""gives in"" to avoid conflict. I get that they were trying to establish Emma was too eager to please and needed to be more assertive about the things she wanted but that angle really only works when the character isn't acting like a petty jerk. Both been planning every detail of their weddings, since first witnessing a wedding 20 years ago at the Plaza Hotel. Therefore, they both have made it a lifetime priority to be married in the same location in June. The montage of power point photos of them planning it is annoying. They schedule their weddings with New York's most famous wedding planner, Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen). She plays little to the plot, but serves as the narrator of the story which also can do without, as there is no needed for it. A clerical error happens, and they are scheduled to have a wedding on the same day which has cause some conflict. Both will not compromise losing the June date. Eventually, the two women declared war and begone to sabotage each other's wedding hints the movie title card. The movie is over the top, the notion that a passionate female friendship can turn ugly only because of one date in a heartbeat is, sadly, unrealistic. The ""true friendship"" in this movie is questionable at best. I mean, they claim that they are grand BFFs, but the minute they can't get their ideal wedding they turn on each other? What type of friendship is that? Two supposedly inseparable lifelong friends doing cruel vindictive things to one another for essentially no real reason and when one of the would-be husbands points out just how ridiculous this behavior is this suddenly makes him an un-supportive, un-seeing, insensitive stick in the mud and the relationship collapses. That's a rotten message: implying that a man's role in a marriage is to blandly indulge and support their spouse in all things even when their spouse is essentially hurting themselves. It makes Emma's fiancé seem like a controlling jerk, when in truth Emma is the one making a fool out of herself. The two main guys can be seen as almost equally offensive (but not quite as much), blank, two-dimensional characters. Whose entire existence hings on working and pleasing their to-be wives. They also seem to have flaws so minimal and small they're ridiculous. I half expected them to just come out and reveal that they were artificial cyborgs made to please ridiculous, mean-spirited, and selfish fake woman stereotypes. Perhaps there would have been potential if they truly went for the dark comedy/satire route, but those types of films generally require endings that aren't happily ever after. It seems, however, that the script intends the audience to identify with the protagonists and even feel warmfuzzies about them at the end. Most do not; actually, I'm pretty sure almost anyone anywhere would find the characters appalling, not to mention probably insulting. This women are not heroes, victimizing a poor woman in a Bloomingdales store scene and the following scene where they're being kicked out the front entrance and have an argument outside. Just doesn't sound like really qualify as good publicity for Bloomingdales or womanhood. The film might have been if the writers had explored a potential lesbian subtext suggested by scenes. And the only thought that kept ringing through my head is why these two women aren't married to each other? They are the only people on Earth that I think could stand one another Seeing how this movie was directed by a man name Gary Winick, the movie is so rife with disparaging female stereotypes, yet the story was written by a woman no less. She equally to blame. It is lucky for us that this movie didn't do well at the box office as that part at the end was clearly sequel baiting. They were on purpose setting up a 'conflict' over the day they'll be having a baby or some type of baby shower 'war'. That sequel idea had a abortion.",Bride Wars
19,Rodrigo_Amaro,Suffocating as a bride dress but just as good to look at it (if you like them).,6,1 July 2012,"Nothing more than a unmistakable distraction for almost two hours and no more than that. That was ""Bride Wars"", movie where Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson play best friends forever who turn out enemies simply because they were forced to marry on the exact same date. And wedding is their greatest dream of all, since they were kids, making plans to celebrate the occasion on a lovely day of June, on a magnificent hotel.Frankly, I'm not much into this kind of movie neither interested in this wedding nonsense and I knew exactly what kind of minefield I was stepping into. It's a collection of moments where Anne and Kate fight each other in order to get what they want and there's room for them discovering one another like never before, those tacky messages destined to the audience. Underneath deep into its nucleus there's plenty of hateful and objectionable things that qualify their battle as being unfair, there's no level between them. Just look closer and you'll find them. It's silly and perhaps that's why it's a little bit enjoyable, far from being a nad film. Takes an epic time to be a little bit funny with four or five scenes; most of the jokes are dull and it's such a obvious movie that is pitiful at parts. Clearly, this is one of those stories that with some brain writing it and made like 20 years ago it would be way funnier.If you have one afternoon to wasting away, go see ""Bride Wars"", just don't take it too seriously, otherwise it's just another headache. 6/10",Bride Wars
20,pennyelenabooks,bridal battles,3,3 March 2014,"Bride wars is a movie about two best friends, Liv and Emma, who happen to have their weddings at the same day at the same place. And as they are planning their weddings, they drift apart and they start battling till the end. The movie is a romantic comedy, mainly about friendships however and not all about romantic love. The battle between the two friends is entertaining and gets better and better as the rivalry develops. Kate Hudson is great in the role of the controlling, competitive business woman, however Anne Hathaway seem a little out of her comfort zone. The two couples too have no chemistry between them. The theme is interesting, but its still the usual romantic comedy plot, with no surprises or twists till the end. All in all, a nice movie about weddings.",Bride Wars
21,insomniac_rod,I feel very stupid...,2,13 February 2010,"...because I wanted to watch this movie when it came out in theaters. Then I didn't rent it at Blockbuster for reasons I can't remember.I watched it when it aired on HBO. And man, what a letdown.The gorgeous Anne Hathaway was the main reason for me to watch this pile of crap. She doesn't save the day. Kate Hudson does her job but it isn't enough.There isn't a single funny moment. This shouldn't be considered as a comedy or drama, or anything.It's a dull, silly, pointless movie that doesn't delivers a single positive message for it's audience.The sexy Anne Hathaway at least shows some skin during her dancing sequences and I thank her for that. The humor is bland and you won't even smile. What was the intention of this movie? The ending that deals with the pregnancy was an insult for cinema.",Bride Wars
22,Anonymous_Maxine,Here come the brides,4,14 April 2009,"It was because of circumstances beyond my control that I was dragged in to watch Bride Wars in the first place, and while I can't avoid admitting that I was truly, truly suffering for the first 30 minutes, I would be lying if I said the film is devoid of laughs. By that, of course, I mean that I did laugh out loud once or twice, briefly, and I was even pleasantly surprised by a mildly unexpected plot development late in the movie. But don't worry, everything else goes strictly by the age-old wedding movie formula. Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson play Emma and Liv, two twentysomethings who have been inseparable best friends since childhood. They have always shared everything, their triumphs, their failures, their emotions, their struggles, their hopes, and of course, their dream of getting married in exactly the same place, the luxurious Plaza Hotel (yes, it's a hotel). Much effort is put forth to get us to understand how close this friendship is, but in their efforts to get themselves engaged, a deep streak of competitiveness is revealed in both of them. Particularly Liv, who doesn't know better than to go jogging into her boyfriend's office and, dripping sweat, blurt out some nonsense about how he should propose to her. Thus is revealed the massive fallacy of logical thinking that permeates the entire movie – ladies, I'm sorry to sound like a chauvinist or whatever, but the run-up to your wedding is not the best time to start acting like a lunatic. Just a suggestion. Not that the grooms would notice, of course, especially not in this movie. Their sole job in the movie isn't just to not notice things, but to not be noticed. They are as unimportant as the honeymoon, which is never mentioned because the girls childhood dreams never extended beyond the wedding ceremony. Maybe they just planned to head on upstairs for a June honeymoon at the Plaza, too?Anyway, the girls get engaged within like, you know, minutes of each other, and then, due to a moronic clerical error, they accidentally get scheduled to be married at the Plaza Hotel at the exact same time on the exact same day. And henceforth, ladies and gentlemen, it's war.First of all, I will say that I have a tough time relating to this belligerent scramble to get married absolutely as soon as humanly possible, but that may simply be because I'm a guy. And if you take nothing else from this review, understand this, Bride Wars is NOT a movie made with the male audience in mind.But I'm willing to accept it, at least as an offshoot of the unspoken jealousy that seems to be finally emerging between them. You see, Liv has enjoyed some success as a lawyer while Emma is an underpaid schoolteacher, and ultimately Liv's sense of entitlement combined with Emma's decision that she's just not gonna take it anymore set up the escalating conflict that takes up the rest of the movie, but from here there's nowhere else to go except down the well-trodden path of half-assed romantic comedies. The biggest problem with the movie is that it tries to get us to laugh as we sit bewildered at how these life-long friends came to such childish blows as viciously sabotaging each other's dreams for reasons of such astonishing selfishness that not only their own grooms really factor into their heads. In fact, I'm surprised the movie didn't get an R rating for all the violence! Blue hair! Orange spray-on tans! Beware, this stuff is not for the squeamish!Of course, my favorite one was where Emma sends Liv enormous daily gift baskets consisting mainly of chocolates and cookies and, you know, butter (actual quote: ""You mean you sat around eating sticks of butter from all over the world?""), because Emma was hoping she would gain enough weight to where she wouldn't be able to fit into her Vera Wang dress (for those of you who don't know Vera Wangs are supposed to be like, super super tight for some reason, and thus insanely expensive). Of course the plan succeeds, but the movie never really lets us know if it was the candy that made her gain weight or the sheer quantity of stupidity inside her that would be necessary for her not to figure out what was going on.But I will tell you this. Something happens involving one of the weddings that may even qualify as more than mildly surprising, because you just don't see this kind of thing in this kind of movie anymore. You'll know what I mean, it's the part just before Liv and Emma forget about their months of hatred toward each other as they lay amidst the ruins of both of their weddings surrounded by the surely disgusted families. Oh, yeah, they're best friends at the end. Is that a spoiler? I don't think so. Maybe. But if you can see a movie poster like this one and not immediately see the arc of the story, well then, you have bigger problems than some guy online ruining the end of a bad comedy.Besides, wouldn't it be more dishonest if I allowed you to spend your time and money watching this thing without knowing what you were getting into? In a situation like this, just trust me, it's better for you to be warned about the movie than to be warned about spoilers about the movie.",Bride Wars
23,lisafordeay,The worst romantic comedy I have eve seen in my life,1,28 September 2010,"I got this on DVD a year ago because I like wedding movies like 27 Dresses,Made of Honor,My best friends wedding and I also like Kate Hudson (who is Goldie Hawn's daughter)and Anne Hathaway(who was in ella enchanted which was a failure and Princess diaries I & II). So I decided to watch it and boy was I bored with it.The story is about two best friends who are both getting married to their long time partners but when they book their weddings with the wedding councilor(Candice Bergin who played Patrick Dempsey's mom in Sweet Home Alabama with Reese Witherspoon)they are horrified when the dates for their weddings are booked on the same day(oh what a shocker).Of course they fight about it and they get their own back at one another like Livs hair turns blue the other girl becomes orange after a fake tan session went wrong etc etc.The whole film was so stupid and so boring I felt like turning off the DVD and burning it. What ever made these two to star in a boring flick like this then I don't know what they were thinking.Another thing that bugged me was that they both became pregnant in the end.So so stupid 0 stars Thank god it wasn't on for long.(89 mins)",Bride Wars
24,robert-temple-1,Little Girls' Fantasies Can Be Dangerous,2,28 June 2009,"I really couldn't watch this all the way through. Kate Hudson, who also co-produced, and Anne Hathaway, have a good screen chemistry and the best chums thing between them works fine. But Anne Hathaway looks haggard and anorexic next to Kate Hudson, who seems to be in the pink and just as healthy as Hathaway looks ill. But the thing which is distressing is the theme. Yes, it could have been really funny, but no, it is 'too close to the bone' and is a kind of nightmare. I realize it was meant to be an amusing and satirical nightmare, but in many places it comes too near to being serious, and the whole thing is very uncomfortable. There really are girls, and we have probably all known some, who have this deep psychiatric problem of full-blown unhealthy wedding obsession and extreme white dress fetishism. Here we find two best friends whose weddings, about which they have been obsessing all their lives, are accidentally scheduled for the same day at the same location, and war breaks out. It could have been so funny ha ha. But it isn't. It is too real. It is all too disturbing and rather nauseating. A great idea to have over a cocktail when you are trying to dream up a story for a really fun film, but something to drop when you are sober. Never, never, should they really have made this. The contrived story in itself is funny, but what lies behind it all is nauseating even to contemplate. After all, those spoilt brat girls to whom the men they drag to the altar are mere accessories, the revolting pampered lifestyle, the disgustingly vulgar diamond engagement rings which they gaze upon in the way a devout Catholic nun might gaze at a holy relic, the assumption that their personal gratification is of universal and supreme importance, the disregard of real life's priorities, the suffocating and oblivious self-indulgence of these empty creatures portrayed in the film, - all of this makes me want to throw up.

It comes in the form of the cinematic monstrosity of the romantic comedy ""Bride Wars"". This evil bridal empire stars Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as Liv & Emma, childhood friends who become bitter rivals when their weddings are scheduled on the same date & time at their fantasy wedding hotel site. All wedding hell breaks loose when Liv & Emma try to one up to each other with manipulative ploys such as: hair dye trickery, weight gain schemes, and more childlike behavior. Sorry to sound like such a hater for Hudson & Hathaway here, but what were they thinking when they signed up? Their commitment to ""Bride Wars"" should have been annulled before filming. Hudson continues her downward spiral to acting inadequacy with her over-the-top performance while the more talented Hathaway was not wearing her exceptional ""Rachel Getting Married"" acting dress here. Director Gary Winicks' excruciating orchestration of ""Bride Wars"" will not get a warm reception from a plethora of film critics and moviegoers. Even more brutal to the Bridal was its hackneyed screenplay by Greg DePaul and Casey Wilson. And those are just some of my weapons of mass movie destruction to ""Bride Wars"".

27,MBunge,Some war crimes prosecutions are definitely needed,3,18 August 2011,"It takes an astounding amount of effort to make women like Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway unwatchable, but Bride Wars accomplishes it. This is one of the most slapdash and underwritten movies I've ever seen, full of inane situations and banal characters stitched together from other unfunny comedies to create a Frankensteinian monster whose very existence spits in the eyes of the gods of humor and honest human emotion. It's really that bad.Liv and Emma (Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway) are lifelong friends that have shared the same dream since girlhood. More than anything in the world, they both want to have June weddings at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Liv grew up to be a high-powered attorney and Emma became a middle school teacher, but they cling to that dream as strongly as ever. And when their respective live-in boyfriends propose to them at virtually the same time, it seems like Liv and Emma's dream will come true. Until both of their weddings are accidentally scheduled for the same day.Now, if you're a guy or a reasonably intelligent female, you may wonder why that would be such a big deal. Whether it would be a double wedding or some other sort of arrangement, it shouldn't take much thought or effort to resolve the problem. I mean, what kind of jackass would deny their lifelong friend their most cherished desire? Well, whatever kind of jackass that is, that's what Liv and Emma are. They immediately start fussing and squabbling over who moves their ceremony, which leads to a full breakdown in the friendship and a series of lame attempts to ruin the other's wedding.Bride Wars is one of those alleged comedies with virtually no jokes. Instead of people saying or even doing funny things, the humor is theoretically supposed to flow out of the awkward and confrontational circumstances into which the characters are thrown. When the characters are as plain as generic aspirin and the situations are as hackneyed as doing a shot-by-shot remake of Gus Van Zant's shot-by-shot remake of Psycho, the humor flows like molasses on a winter's day.This thing is almost uncomfortably unfunny. When you add in a script that seems more like an outline than a full fledged screenplay, direction that's as undifferentiated as pea soup fog, artlessly manipulative transformations in character and the fact that Hudson and Hathaway don't even look that good through most of the movie, the end product is less like something you'd see in a theater and more like what you'd find under your seat in a theater.Bride Wars is awful. I can't understand how anyone ever thought or even hoped it might be any good. This is the chick flick version of one of those grotesquely bad Sylvester Stallone films from the 1980s and early 90s that leave you in slackjawed astonishment at what happened to the guy who wrote, directed and starred in an Oscar-winning motion picture. If your significant other ever wants you to watch this movie, it's time to start looking at the other fish in the sea.",Bride Wars
28,MaxBorg89,"Let's get married... yeah, right",4,11 March 2009,"Martin Scorsese once famously said he does one movie for the studio and one for himself, and so do many other directors or actors (George Clooney admits he did Ocean's Thirteen because that way he could do Michael Clayton next). Although Anne Hathaway hasn't explicitly said she does that, one can assume it's the only rational explanation for a piece of anti-cinematic trash like Bride Wars. Shooting The Devil Wears Prada after Brokeback Mountain is one thing, tainting your Oscar-nominated legacy with this bunch of nonsense is another.And yet it sounded like it could be a lot of fun, at least judging by the premise, which reverses the classic wedding stereotype: women are in it for the romance, guys are game because it's fun (that's what they make it look like in American comedies, anyway). This time around, the dudes are in it for the love, and the girls want to get married just to make a childhood dream come true. Apparently, if you're a woman and live in Manhattan, the ultimate dream of your life is to get married at the Plaza in June, so when best friends Liv (Kate Hudson with a Paris Hilton/Britney Spears haircut) and Emma (Hathaway) get asked the fundamental question by their beaus, they immediately try to book the right place and date. A mix-up occurs, and so they're both stuck with the same date, June 6th. Neither wants to postpone what's supposed to be the happiest day of their lives, therefore a full-on war is declared on both parts.At this point, the real silliness kicks in: diet sabotage, tans gone awry and the occasional witty remark, like ""Your wedding's gonna be huge, just like your ass at prom"". What started as a potentially entertaining critique of materialism and shallowness is revealed to be a poorly executed farce, with a succession of lame jokes instead of a plot (then again, one of the screenwriters is best known for performing on Saturday Night Live, where the skits have no connection whatsoever, so that may be an explanation) and two atrocious caricatures instead of leading ladies.In fairness, no one ever expected any true brilliance from Hudson, given the last really good movie she appeared in was Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous in 2000, but surely someone could have told Hathaway you just don't choose something this bland after working with Jonathan Demme (or Ang Lee, for that matter). Maybe she wanted to return to her comedic roots, but sadly there's nothing even remotely funny in Bride Wars, save for a few brief scenes featuring the reliable Candice Bergen. Everything else is just like Liv and Emma: obsessed with getting everything right, but ultimately too self-centered to get any sympathy from others.",Bride Wars

31,EUyeshima,"Absurd Sitcom Reveals Itself as a Disposable, Pre-Adolescent Fantasy Farce",2,26 November 2009,"I am so far removed from the target audience of this cartoonish, estrogen-heavy 2009 farce that it became a challenge to sit all the way through its blissfully brief 89-minute running time. The by-the-numbers screenplay by Greg DePaul, June Diane Raphael, and former SNL regular Casey Wilson could have been a sharp satire on the excesses of wedding-related commerce or a black comedy about competitiveness among the superficially entitled, either approach of which I would have praised. Sadly, it's neither, and as limply directed by Gary Winick (""13 Going on 30""), it seems targeted squarely to privileged pre-adolescent girls because the two principals reflect the obsessive, childish mindset of that age. Their emotional immaturity and sitcom-level behavior become draining.This contemporary parable focuses on childhood best pals Liv and Emma, which of course in this movie's simplistic terms, means they are opposites in every possible way. Liv is the wealthy, über-ambitious lawyer and naturally the less sympathetic one, while Emma is a doormat struggling to make ends meet as a middle-school teacher. To meet the plot's dimensions, it is Liv who has the perfect boyfriend, all understanding and patience, while Emma has a live-in boyfriend who apparently has issues with her budding emancipation. Waiting in the wings is Liv's brother who is made to look so ideal that the screenplay might as well telegraph the resolution. The plot turns on a consultation with Manhattan's leading wedding planner Marion St. Clare, whose administrative assistant erroneously double-booked Liv's and Emma's wedding on the same June day at the Plaza Hotel. The rest of the movie is about how they one-up each other with fraternity-level pranks until the inevitable conclusion.Kate Hudson (who also co-executive produced) seems to becoming a worse actress with every movie, as she plays almost every scene as Liv with the subtlety of a mime artist. I don't recognize any of the talent she showcased as free-spirit groupie Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" nearly a decade ago. Anne Hathaway comes across marginally better as Emma, but that's like saying the Roadrunner has slightly more credibility than Wile E. Coyote. As Marion, Candice Bergen keeps playing the same role over and over again that I'm starting to wonder if a decade as Murphy Brown was a fluke. Kristen Johnston delivers the film's one truly sardonic note as Emma's fellow teacher-turned-maid of honor. The three men are mere background filler, although Bryan Greenberg (""Prime"") looks to be making an attempt at a dimensional character. At least cinematographer Frederick Elmes gives the movie the appropriately polished sheen. The 2009 DVD contains three deleted scenes, all excisable, and an extended commercial for designer Vera Wang, whose wedding gowns are spotlighted in the film.",Bride Wars
32,fertilecelluloid,Just when you thought dumb couldn't get any dumber...,1,14 January 2009,"Director Gary Winick ought to be ashamed of himself for creating such utter garbage as this and spitting on cinema's potential. The film is legitimate ""anti-cinema"", sort of a big screen TV pilot that doesn't even come close to the quality of contemporary TV. It exists in a curious time warp of brainless, vapid twaddle that would boggle any intelligent mind. Clearly, ""Bride Wars"" isn't aimed at intelligent minds. At the session I attended with my partner, several unfortunate looking, slightly overweight women constantly texted and glanced upwards occasionally at the screen. It has become infuriating to watch movies at the cinema with these little glowing squares popping up all around you in the dark as you're trying to concentrate. I told two of these women to stop texting and was met with moronic, vacant stares. These people are the audience for ""Bride Wars"", although they're not the only ones texting; that's a cancer that has infected cinema going worldwide. As you would expect, the dreadful and vile Kate Hudson toplines this hideous wreck. She opted to smear her entire career with cinematic manure years ago, so her appearance in this was inevitable. Not so Ann Hathaway, who recently starred in and was quite good in the highly overrated ""Rachel Getting Married"". At least that had a semi-decent script and was directed by a filmmaker, not a fraud and betrayer of Real Men. Is Hathaway being groomed to replace Hudson? Or maybe Jennifer Anniston? I sincerely hope not. The story is simple and predictable. Hudson and Hathaway have been friends since childhood. They once visited a famous New York hotel and witnessed a wedding. From that moment, these vacuous, boring women have been obsessed with getting married at the same hotel on the same day. Zoom forward two decades. Hudson is now a horrible lawyer and an utter bitch. Hathaway is a slightly more tolerable, doormat-type girl who has just been proposed to. Hudson is angry about that. She is so angry, in fact, that she marches into the office of her pussy-whipped fiancé and demands he propose to her, which he does. If you're looking for strong, independent men who wouldn't put up with a minute of this woman's crap, you're in the wrong movie. These movies are all about men (most men, actually) who've been brainwashed into thinking that their job in life is to make women's dreams come true. Screw their own ambitions. These guys have no balls at all. Anyway, once these two dreadful dames are engaged, they visit wedding planner Candace Bergen, who informs them that it won't be possible for them to get married on the same day because the hotel is fully booked. That's when the film starts earning its ""Bride Wars"" title. Although they've been buddies for years, these so-called friends plot and scheme to ruin each other's ""Big Day"". This really is frightening film-making. Starting with the premise that a woman's wedding is ""The Biggest Day Of Her Life"" (how depressing!), it goes from bad to much worse as director (?) Winick rapes every cliché in the book in his attempt to milk laughs from the retarded script. Not only does everything end ""happily"" (if you can call getting married to Kate Hudson happy), the writers contradict their own logic in order to contrive a resolution. Although everybody has been told that there is no room at the hotel for two weddings (which is the basic dramatic set-up), the climax takes place at the hotel as the two weddings take place in two difference areas. Huh?! Sloppy? You bet. Hathaway is probably too young to realize that making this would do nothing for her career. Then again, she probably made a killing financially, so who cares, right? I do, but that's silly of me. Not surprisingly, the film opened with healthy grosses, guaranteeing that more of its stinking, rancid ilk will be rolling down the assembly line very soon. The fat, homely ""princesses"" out there should be ecstatic.",Bride Wars

36,pyrocitor,"Lazy, predictable screen writing with an offensively bland veneer - just as much a disaster as the pending weddings depicted",2,24 May 2009,"Given its fusion of the spheres of materialistic excess and idealized romantic love, the immense presence of the wedding within popular culture should come as little surprise, being arguably the single most prevalent 'happy ending' plot point and often an easy way of concisely suggesting a lifetime of resolution and happiness. As such, the treatment of weddings within mainstream film tends to take on a somewhat birfucated approach, either challenging and questioning the reality of such a romanticized social construction, or relishing in the fun and overt sentiment of the sort of wedding everyone has been taught to yearn for. With this in mind, Bride Wars becomes an intriguing example of Hollywood's prevailing treatment of the 'wedding film' subgenre - while its premise initially suggests a critique and send up of the lavish excesses of popular weddings, the film can ultimately not avoid caving to syrupy cliché and delivering an adoring treatment to the social institution it initially promised to challenge. The film as a whole reflects this rocky tonal imbalance, which only serves to expose many of its deeper and more insulting flaws and shortcomings. Despite a vaguely absurd sounding premise (two best friends, both engaged on the same day, are forced to fight for their ideal wedding venue, causing a rift and fighting between one another), the film retained promise, with 'sad but true' kernels of profundity (how easily a friendship can be thrown to the winds and the common theme of the superficial flashiness of weddings overcoming the feelings involved, among others) which could have resulted in a satisfactory satire in the hands of a capable director or careful, intricate script. Unfortunately, Bride Wars could not be more sorely lacking on either front, and as such, the film as a whole quickly descends into being more of a disaster than either protagonist's pending weddings, with the rare successful trace of broad satire often undermined by the screen writing's tendency to cave to easy, sap- fraught cliché and plot-be-damned circumstance, making even its occasional high points feel deflated and redundant. Otherwise the film could be used as a textbook example of lazy, sloppy screen writing and a checklist of mainstream romance centered (if not outright 'rom-com') comedy clichés, pounded into the audience's head through drawn out, dreary slapstick lacking the necessary acerbic spark to be any sort of funny, and a particularly wearisome array of cathartic emotional speeches. If there is a single positive note among the deluge of negative, the film does boast a climactic twist which manages to be slightly unpredictable and vaguely realistic - both shocking surprises in a film which could not be farther from either quality overall. Of course, this brief moment of innovation is quickly superseded by yet another sloppy, cliché- inundated patch of screen writing, but for a matter of minutes, the film hints at the exponentially superior film which might have resulted from its chaotic, sickening mess. Even the musical score is woefully unoriginal, succeeding only in making each increasingly banal development all the more difficult to stomach.It is a common practice in many such female geared mainstream comedies to have frustratingly underdeveloped male characters, and Bride Wars gleefully carries on such a trait, with the barely glimpsed male figures reduced to cardboard cut-outs, or pantomimes of masculinity which fulfill only a single note of characterisation or narrative function (the ""sweet guy"", insensitive jock, etc.). One scene has Kate Hudson's character lying in bed with her fiancé, expressing her sorrows at how alone she feels and completely ignoring his attempts at consoling and comforting her - while a particularly insulting moment in a film chock full of them, it also demonstrates how utterly unimportant the men in the film are whatsoever. However, a less common genre trait is to have the female characters painted in just as superficial, reductionist terms as the men in the story, yet Bride Wars proves just as determined to reduce both sexes to insulting stereotypes, including, to a worrisomely large degree, its protagonists. As such, the film's only real saving grace is the luminous presence of Anne Hathaway. Despite being stuck with a tiresomely familiar role (the overly caring woman who forgets to look after her own needs), Hathaway refuses to succumb entirely to convention, and instead infuses her character with a spark of gutsy enthusiasm and her seemingly unquenchable trademark charisma and quirky charm - the only mercifully palatable element in the film, and clearly a far better piece of acting than such a film deserves. Unfortunately Kate Hudson does not match up, making the sympathies of the viewer, intended to be evenly distributed among protagonists, feel substantially one sided. While Hudson is not a disaster by any means, she simply appears to float by on autopilot, refusing to devote enough energy, warmth or comedic spark to breath life into her character, and as such coming across as somewhat of a selfish, unlikeable miser, a black hole of characterisation. Supposed comic relief from Candice Bergen as an obsessive wedding planner translates instead into only more tiresome drivel, and her contribution of a hilariously out of place narration only further draws to light the ignorant and lazy screen writing, as if refusing to simply let the narrative develop on its own. But what is perhaps the most objectionable to Bride Wars is how seemingly inoffensively bland it is, as if the filmmakers and cast could not muster up the energy to be as outlandishly terrible as most other films with as little going for them. As such, Bride Wars is not only resoundingly poor on just about every possible front, but unenthusiastically so, making the film not only cringe-worthy to watch, but also rather boring. Even fans of the genre in search of light, superficial entertainment are unlikely to derive much enjoyment from such an altogether uninspired and tiresomely predictable piece of cinematic refuse.-2/10",Bride Wars

38,Sirus_the_Virus,"Stupid, but pretty funny.",6,5 August 2009,"Bride Wars tanked with critics and at the box-office. I would agree, but I'm one of the rare few who actually enjoyed it. It makes up for Kate Hudson's Fools Gold last year. I didn't think it was a bad film, but at least Bride Wars is actually memorable. It was good to see Candice Bergan(Murphey Brown) return to the big screen once again. I haven't seen her in anything since Sweet Home Alabama, which has one of the worst endings in history. I like Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson, of course. Bride Wars is silly at times, but I still think it's fun to watch and it's funny. The Plot: Two successful women are engaged. They have had a life long dream of getting married at the Plaza Hotel and for each one to go to each others wedding. It turns out they are both to be married on the same date. From there on out, it's war. Who will go to who's wedding? How will one go to the other's wedding? They don't know, so from there on out, it's war. The two women begin to do stuff to make each wedding look bad. They do stuff like dye one's hair blue and hire a dancing instructor to work them to death and turn out that the instructor is an impostor. I think it's kind of ridiculous that these women would go all out like this. It's kind of stupid. I still recommend Bride Wars because it's fun and it's funny and it's entertaining.",Bride Wars
39,hall895,The chick flick from hell,4,21 August 2014,"Bride Wars is an unabashed chick flick. You know going in that if you're a guy you're probably not going to enjoy this one. But after sitting through it it's hard to see how anyone could possibly enjoy this quite wretched movie. If you're making a chick flick shouldn't you produce something chicks might enjoy? Nobody is getting any enjoyment out of this tripe.Emma and Liv, played by Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson respectively, are lifelong best friends who both share a dream. Since childhood they've been obsessed with having June weddings at New York's famed Plaza hotel. Now they're all grown up, their respective fiancées have both proposed and their dreams are about to come true. But an unfortunate clerical error sees both their weddings scheduled on the same day. And the two women dig in their heels, each refusing to move her date. War is declared, Emma and Liv each go to outrageous extremes in attempts to sabotage the other's wedding. Sadly none of this is at all funny. In this supposed comedy nothing genuinely funny ever happens. Hathaway and Hudson give it game efforts but they really have nothing to work with, the script is just dreadful. And the two stars are burdened with carrying the whole movie themselves as the men just stand idly by and watch the women go nuts. The movie tries to toss in some character development. The passive, people-pleasing Emma needs to become more confident. The headstrong, controlling Liv needs to let go. This theme is painfully obvious and is belabored to the point of sheer tedium. The two main characters never end up being relatable, embraceable or particularly likable. And if you don't like Emma and Liv there's no way you'll like the movie. There's nothing else there for you to grab onto. It's not funny, it's not charming, it's not interesting. It's less a movie and more a 90-minute Vera Wang commercial. And who wants to watch that?",Bride Wars
40,jon.h.ochiai,"Soul Mates in ""Bride Wars"" Win Out",7,9 February 2009,"Okay, I liked ""Bride Wars"". Admittedly ""Bride Wars"" is not any sort of Oscar threat. It is a funny and sweet, albeit clumsy erratic romantic comedy. Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson are great. In particular Anne Hathaway provides the emotional anchor in this fluffy romance. Director Gary Winick directed ""13 Going on 30"" a few years back which was really well done. ""Bride Wars"" is not as good. However, I think it redeems itself for its heart and sentiment. Hudson and Hathaway play childhood best friends Liv and Emma, who always dreamed of getting married at the Plaza Hotel in New York. 20 years later Liv and Emma find themselves engaged and hire Wedding Coordinator extraordinaire Marion St. Claire (classic Candice Bergen). They get their wish: dream June Weddings at The Plaza Hotel. Liv and Emma being soul sisters, of course will be each other's Maid of Honor.Predictably due to a glitch by Marion's assistant Liv and Emma's weddings are booked on the same day. Of course type A driven corporate attorney Liv (Hudson) initially expects ""nice girl"" school teacher Emma (Hathaway) to acquiesce. But neither will back down. Thus, begins the ""Bride Wars"". This is nearly as ridiculous as ""The Clone Wars"", although intentionally funny. We witness catty exchanges. Emma says, ""Your wedding's gonna be huge, just like your ass at prom."" Liv replies, ""Your wedding can suck it."" Not always inspired repartee. There is a hilarious bit where Liv expounds the Zen quality of Vera Wang. When Liv and Emma are at each other's throat there are hysterical moments. Liv causes Emma to turn orange at a tanning salon. Emma fattens up Liv by sending gift food baskets to her office-- Liv thinking they are from her fiancé Daniel (understanding Steve Howay). They include cookies and sweets. But the classic is that Liv actually consumes the butters of the world mix.Despite the unevenness, writers Greg DePaul and Casey Wilson delve underneath the high jinx: looking at whether Liv and Emma have found their respective soul mates in Daniel (Howay) and Fletcher (Chris Pratt). It's not entirely what we expected. At a narrative catharsis the vulnerable Hathaway's Emma exclaims, ""I can't do this"" This goes to perhaps the underlying theme expressed so eloquently by Bergen's Marion,"" the one person who knows you sometimes better than you know yourself is the same person who's been standing beside you all along.""The shortcoming of ""Bride Wars"" is not sustaining this eloquence throughout, when it deserves it. Hathaway infuses some of the needed poignancy here: As she really looks at her life when she talks with her dear friend, who also is Liv's solid brother Nate (charming Bryan Greenberg). Hudson, although seemingly having a bad hair movie, is at her quirky and spirited best playing the strung too tight Liv. What ""Bride Wars"" misses is more quiet time between gags, so Liv and Emma can just be. It's hysterical seeing Hathaway pole dancing. But it is also touching seeing Liv hug Emma's Dad.Hathaway, Hudson, and Bergen make up for much of the rougher spots of the screenplay. ""Bride Wars"" works, because it is the story of best friends and soul mates who get distracted from what is really importantlove. In the end ""Bride Wars"" gets it right.",Bride Wars

Unfortunately for them, the wedding planner mixes their dates so now they're due to be married on the same day. For them, this is simply unacceptable and because they cannot get to an agreement, the begin to fight each other (fortunately not literally). From here on, we see two women desperate to destroy the other's wedding rather than looking after their own.Although it started rather promising, the whole situation really gets out of hand. It's absolutely idiotic how two such friends would try to ruin the other, and their methods are at least stupid.

Gary Winick's 'Bride Wars' is not terrible - it is plain mediocre and that's it biggest flaw.

Bride Wars had the potential to be funny but unfortunately this one fails on every level. It isn't remotely funny, the characters are awful and the dialogue and the plot boring. Even though it's a relatively short film it seems to drag on and on. The acting from the two leads is very poor but whether this can be blamed solely on the actresses or the awful script is up for debate. Anne Hathaway probably comes out with more credit but Kate Hudson is just terrible. Neither of the characters is remotely likable and in a film like this, that is a critical flaw. Both come across as spoiled and vindictive and it is impossible to have any sympathy with either.I thought I might enjoy this but it is one of the poorest romantic films I've seen, lacking any sparkle at all.

44,qormi,Lethal Chick Flick,1,8 July 2012,"I watched this with my wife out of kindness. When it finally ended, I felt emasculated. I ran to the fridge and drank a Budweiser. That wasn't enough. I drove to 7-11 and bought a King Cobra Malt Liquor 40 oz. I drove home and chugged it, and smoked a cigar. Then I tuned into the NFL channel and watched NFL training camp videos. Then, I listened to a Lynyrd Skynyrd ""Lyve From Steel Town"" CD. I finally recovered before I almost drove to the tattoo parlor. This horrible, girly chick flick met all the requirements: white people dancing to Motown, women putting apologetic men in their place, and massive lapses from reality. Jennifer Hudson's orange tan and Anne Hathaway's matronly princess look was enough. Ms. Hathaway even kept her boobs covered this time.",Bride Wars

Little do they know that human frailty is against them - and what starts as the perfect adventure soon turns into the most horrible nightmare imaginable. From there what once was the best possible friendship slowly turns into a terrible war.A meager story at best, the above is the backing line of this film. It could have been enough if it had been worked out some better, but quite sadly this comedy fails to be funny and that is IMO one of the prime requisites of a comedy - making the audience laugh out loud a good number of times and keep them amused until after the ending credits.This film fails to be funny. The two main characters and their actions are not entirely badly chosen - but the way they are acted out are just too much of a cliché or too clearly acted. There's also too little moments that could have worked out - there's far too many soft spots where the film just rolls on without anything happening.The most positive effect of the film was the side role played by Kristen Johnson who turns every scene she appears in into a short lasting hilarious feast. It isn't enough to save the film though - it's still a piece of rubbish.2 out of 10 bridal tragedies wasted",Bride Wars
46,bbewnylorac,Privileged nonsense,4,12 September 2020,"Yes I realise this is a rom-com, but that doesn't mean it has to be brainless. Unfortunately, it is brainless. I know the two leads, Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway, are meant to be neurotic, but they take narcissism to a new level. Here they are - bickering with each other about wedding dates (how can that be the entire plot?) when people elsewhere in the world have real problems that are far more worthy of being filmed. The dialogue sounds like it's been lifted from hearing two teenage girls moan over a boy they both like. The music is that manic, over orchestrated big Hollywood studio kind - i.e. annoying. But the main problem is that this film is missing a heart. It's depicting two wealthy, well loved, white women who have nothing to worry about, acting like entitled, petulant children. But it's not even funny.",Bride Wars
47,DavidSim240183,War Brides would have been better,2,18 September 2011,"Bride Wars is a right waste of celluloid. Its a no-account, laugh-absent rom-com with absolutely nothing going for it. Even twentysomething cosmopolitans waiting for the fairytale wedding to fall into they're laps will no doubt be turned off by this one.Liv and Emma (Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway) have been friends since birth practically. In one of the film's more amusing moments, the two as kids practice walking down the aisle, with Liv as the bride and Emma as the groom (Make of that what you will!). By the time they're 28, they're impatiently waiting for they're boyfriends to pop the question (my low-attention span for the movie means they're names escape me).When they finally do, Liv and Emma start planning they're dream weddings. Its always been the plan to hold it at the Plaza Hotel, but the waiting list is huge, and thanks to a clerical error, they wind up booked on the same day. Neither bride wants to postpone, so they go all out to sabotage the big day for each other.Bride Wars crowns a compost heap of wedding movies we've seen in the past few years. Along with 27 Dresses and Wedding Crashers, this one isn't much cop as well. It didn't have to be that way. The potential for a scathing black comedy is bubbling beneath the surface. But sadly, the film has been lumbered with a director with no affinity for the material.The late Gary Winick once seemed a promising talent, with the sharp and incisive coming-of-age tale Tadpole. But towards the end of his life, he then fell into light, frothy fare that was much less interesting. In fact Bride Wars reminded me of Winick's first venture into Chick Flick territory, 13 Going On 30, where Jennifer Garner played a teen trapped inside of a woman's body. Compared to the far superior Big, which still remains the definitive word on the subject, 13 Going On 30 was a pallid rehash with none of the same laughs or insights.And Winick fails again with Bride Wars. He fails to bring out the good things in the material, and produces only the bad. The film seems to want to be a cutting satire on the wedding industry - something ripe for lampooning. But Bride Wars never escapes the padded kid gloves Winick directs it with.Winick directs it down at the level of a cuddly, bubbly rom-com, with all the black comedy bled out of the material. Where he could have used Liv and Emma's dilemma as a way of exposing the vapid world of wedding planners, instead he turns the girls into goofy, dislikable airheads. For instance, we get scenes like Liv tampering with Emma's tan, turning her bright orange, almost like a female Oompa-Loompa. And in response, Emma secretly feeds Liv so many chocolates, she's too fat to fit into her wedding dress.Perhaps I would have laughed a bit more if Winick had taken the time to develop Liv and Emma. But they're little more than polar opposites. Liv is a decisive, go-for-broke lawyer. Emma is a prissy, reticent schoolteacher. I found it difficult to care for these two, and I cared even less about the outcome.Anne Hathaway is certainly a talented screen presence. She has natural beauty and acting ability, but she's not always a good judge when it comes to picking decent scripts. Perhaps when she signed on to Bride Wars she was expecting a clever, witty film hidden beneath a glossy polish, like The Devil Wears Prada. Sadly, Bride Wars is all gloss and polish, supported by an unfunny script that's neither clever, nor informative.Another problem is that Bride Wars isn't nasty enough. The things Liv and Emma do to each other are just silly, and the one-joke nature of the screenplay isn't enough to support the film for the whole running-time. Another film I'm reminded of is The War of the Roses, the merciless black comedy about two people trying to destroy one another. What made it more shocking was these people were married to each other. But it still saw it through to the very end. It was a film that shone a very uncomfortable light on the darker corners of divorce.But Bride Wars doesn't have a Danny DeVito pulling the strings. Gary Winick has no flair at all for black comedy, and unlike DeVito, he sees the need to redeem the girls at the end. Is there any doubt at all that Liv and Emma will come to realise that friendship is more important than petty rivalries?As is often the case of Hollywood rom-coms, the laughs come more from supporting players. Its nice to see Candice Bergen back, who's been away from screens far too long. Her dry sarcasm is well suited to the wedding planner narrating the tale (like DeVito's lawyer in The War of the Roses). And Kristen Johnston amuses as Emma's lazy, self-involved maid of honour. Hathaway and Hudson haven't got a prayer whenever they're in the picture.Bride Wars is a soggy, sour footnote in Hollywood's beloved romantic-comedy genre. Its never as funny as it thinks it is, and the story's not involving in the slightest. Its a shame that Gary Winick didn't live to see Bridesmaids. Then he could have seen how the story should have been done.",Bride Wars

I would guess it's tweener girls, but I wouldn't want my daughters to see women acting petty and selfish. The two lead characters are awful people acting in cruel ways. I sort of like dark comedies, but this didn't play as a dark comedy, either.The premise is horrible. The writing doesn't take it anywhere. The acting even wasn't all that great.

51,Stompgal_87,A wedding film with a difference,9,30 March 2014,"I remember seeing this advertised shortly before it was released and how I wanted to see it because it looked different from other wedding films I've seen such as 'Runaway Bride (best wedding film I've seen in my life so far)' and 'My Best Friend's Wedding (not quite as good as this one or 'Runaway Bride' but it still had two of my favourite actresses in the names of Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz).' I saw this with a member of staff from my former care home (going to the cinema was a regular pastime for me when I lived there) and we enjoyed it partly due to my insistence of dragging her along to see the 'girlie films.' Re-visiting this just over five years after my first viewing, I still enjoyed it although I noticed a few things differently.One complaint I have about this film is its uneven pacing. Up until the scene where Marion the wedding planner announces that Liv's and Emma's weddings were booked on the same day, it was somewhat slow. After that scene it slows down again up until Emma sends Liv several treats so that Liv can't fit into her wedding dress; Liv ruins Emma's spray tan; Emma swaps Liv's chosen highlight colour for blue and so on. That part of the actual 'wars' was swiftly paced but after that the pace slows down again until the wedding scene. In spite of the uneven pacing, the movie was brilliantly filmed, included some fine uses of still photography, was sumptuously edited (particularly the brief scenes of Emma passing the news of her engagement to her friends and Emma announcing her 'save-the-date'), and well-acted if it was silly and a little overdone in places. The incidental music was classy and charming in a similar manner to that used in 'Enchanted' and I liked some of the songs on the soundtrack such as Duffy's songs 'Rain On Your Parade' and 'I'm Scared,' Eve's 'Tambourine' and Technotronic's 'Pump Up the Jam.' The set designs were elaborate, particularly those of Marion's office and the wedding venue, Anne Hathaway was especially beautiful while the plot and script were fresh for a wedding film. I also found the opening sequence and the flashback of Liv and Emma witnessing a wedding plus playing 'weddings' themselves absolutely adorable.The writing was witty and clever in places and I liked how Emma and Liv made up during Liv's wedding (due to Emma having called hers off but still attending Liv's reception and marrying someone else a year later). I also liked how the announcements of Liv and Emma becoming pregnant and their babies being due on the same day linked to their weddings being booked on the same day, despite the ending being rather abrupt.All in all the pacing was uneven but I liked its originality and it is the second best wedding film I have seen to date. 9/10.",Bride Wars

53,Jay_Exiomo,Matrimonial disasters,3,15 January 2009,"No wonder weddings are a dreaded event if ""Bride Wars"" be the case, as there's not much to be laughed about in this mirthless chick flick about two best friends trying to sabotage each other's matrimonial preparations when their wedding dates were accidentally booked on the same day at their much-sought New York City's Plaza Hotel. As if getting past the overly contrived premise isn't enough, the film's lackadaisical direction that centers on the increasingly cartoonish brushes between its shrill and dunderhead protagonists prove too much to salvage for the combined charm of Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway.Hudson and Hathaway play Liv and Emma, childhood buddies who gush from having been proposed to by their boyfriends and the prospect of having their dream wedding at the ritzy locale but instantly turn bitter rivals upon realizing that due to a scheduling foul up, only one of them can proceed. When neither bride-to-be would budge from the fully booked June date, both woman take their insubstantial conflict into a catty fight of who can outmaneuver the other into taking the remaining slot - feeding Liv too much sweets so she'll be too plump to fit into her Vera Wang dress, disrupting Emma during a spray-painting to turn her skin into orange, etc. Such single-minded skirmish merely reduces its characters into irritating dunces when it's supposed to be the source of humor.Hudson and Hathaway may be charming women but no thanks to Gary Winnick's lifeless direction of a hackneyed script, both actors are reduced to annoying females in a drab romantic comedy which has an easy resolution obvious at the start, but won't go there before piling up on the slapstick with such airheaded vigor and patching them up with compulsory schmaltz. It's a win-win situation for all in the end except perhaps for the hapless audience.",Bride Wars
54,Jerique,Bride Wars is a battle no audience can win.,6,12 January 2009,"The movie starts off with Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson) planning to have their dream weddings at The Plaza in June. Their respective partners, propose and the planning commences. Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen) is the planner and her assistant accidentally screws up the dates of their weddings and books them both on June 6. At first it's friendly, but eventually, Emma forces Liv to gain five pounds so she can't fit her dress, Liv books Emma's favourite band, but Emma fights back by dying Liv's hair blue.It's not so much a comedy or a romance. It's halfway of each. It's more about friendship than anything else. The movie foreshadows the ending with a flashback to 20 years prior to the movie's occurred events at the start. You'll laugh a few times, you'll say ""oh my God"" a couple times, you'll utter ""aww"" here and there and you'll maybe have a good time watching it.It's a decent film, but it's nothing special. It's a chick flick that some guys can connect to. You can figure out who's gonna 'win' the war pretty easily. You can also figure out Emma's subplot quickly too. The comedy is good enough to keep you smiling. The romance is good enough to keep you interested. The rest of the movie is good enough to see through to the end, but this one won't be remembered in twenty years. I hardly think anyone will watch this more than two dozen times during their lifetime.I recommend you pass on this one and look for something better in the box office because odds are there's a better movie playing at the same time.",Bride Wars

Anne Hathaway's transformation from Milquetoast to Xena is a bit less well-handled but she gets the job done.The biggest disappointment in this one is Candy Bergen who walks through this one throwing her lines away in what should have been a made-to-order role.No matter, the two fiancés provide surprisingly interesting supporting performances. The girlfriends are hysterically funny. Best of all was John Pankow (whom I hadn't seen in quite some time) as Hathaway's father giving the film its heart and its most memorable scene.

56,lyubitelfilmov,Two girlfriends had a fight or Kindergarten on the road,7,8 January 2021,"Comedy. A picture that I stumbled upon by accident while looking for a movie starring the beautiful Anne Hathaway. I admit honestly that I did not expect much - just to laugh heartily, well, at least in a few moments - and my wish came true. Who would have thought. The comedy turned out to be a comedy, and was not covered by other genres. And here's my brief opinion - A kindergarten on the road. As elsewhere, there are both pluses, which made me pleasant and interesting to watch, and minuses, which spoiled the impression a little. Well, okay, let's finish with the introductory word and dwell on the picture in more detail.
So the pros:
1. Scenario - two girlfriends, as they say, ""do not spill water"" receive offers from their boyfriends about marriage. But there was a certain occasion - both weddings are scheduled for the same day, and postponing at least one of them is the same as asking the film academy to award Oscars to excellent and really important films, and not to the laughing stock that is now (hello "" 12 Years of Slavery ""and"" Moonlight ""). This circumstance turns the once best friends into the worst enemies who begin to spoil the life of themselves and those around them. If you do not take one moment (which I will mention in the minuses), then the script turned out to be quite good, simple and, most importantly, working. The characters of the heroines are classic and perfectly reveal themselves in dialogues. There are no revelations. The environment is the same. But it still clings. Do not think, of course, that this comedy is ""for all time"", but for an evening in the company of a loved one - the very thing.
2. Humor - as I said, there are frankly hilarious moments that turned out clearly on the go, so to speak, improvisation. All the rest is antics (in moderation) and a lot of funny situations that will cause a slight smile and definitely cheer up. And the intrigues of the brides - then a natural kindergarten on the road! I wanted to laugh - so I laughed, which I advise you.
3. Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson - the whole picture is based on the relationship of these beauties, and they did not disappoint. Looking at the picture, you feel that these girls are connected by many years of friendship and empathize with each to a certain extent. They both deserve their dream wedding. They are completely different, but this does not prevent them from being friends.
So the cons:
1. Scenario twist - I will not name it, so as not to spoil the viewing for those who have not yet seen the picture. And although they explained everything in the finale, this does not change my disappointment. Why did this happen? What are you doing?
2. Intrigues - they could be more inventive. Those present in the picture are simple and too banal (albeit hilarious), but I would like to be really virtuoso and mind-blowing. This point is pure nitpicking, just one minus - it's not serious!
A little about the main characters:
1. Olivia Lerner performed by Kate Hudson is a lawyer, Emma's bosom friend, who intends to ""persuade"" the latter to postpone the wedding date. Tough, shameless, unprincipled, insidious. She puts no one above herself in anything or anyone. In short, an egoist who is very difficult to defeat. I remember Kate from the historical drama ""Four Feathers"" and the musical ""Nine"". She played her heroine perfectly. I can only praise. Kisses to Kate's hand!
2. Emma Allen performed by Anne Hathaway - a school teacher, Olivia's bosom friend, who does not intend to give in on the question of the wedding date. She is quiet and modest by nature, thinking primarily about others. In order to win, he decides to become cocky, assertive, arrogant, and so on. All for the sake of victory, as they say. But in the pursuit of victory, can she remain herself? That is the question. The charming and beautiful Ann here again pleases the eye. Yes, it's just nice to look at her, and acting is out of place. Good Ann! Kisses to the pen!
What else pleased me - the movie is not prolonged. And with its budget (thirty million cabbage leaves), it successfully showed itself at the box office, and thank God that the producers and studio owners decided not to shoot a sequel.
This picture is clearly intended for a female audience (although it was filmed by the man Gary Vinik, unfortunately now deceased), but I liked it. Perhaps someday, I will even revise it.
Beautiful Anne, your best role ever was two parts of The Princess Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada and two parts of Alice. Although you're good here too, you're perfect in The Princess Diaries!
As a result, we have a good comedy about a quarrel between two bosom friends, with a good script, great humor, good acting work and an excellent duet of two beauties - Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway!

57,Gideon24,Laughs are provided despite a premise that was hard to get behind.,5,16 April 2015,"Under the category of silly and pointless comes the 2009 comedy Bride Wars, a film that provides sporadic laughs here and there, but strains credibility at just about every turn.Kate Hudson plays Liv and Anne Hathaway plays Emma, childhood BFF's who have both dreamed of having their weddings at the Plaza in June ever since they were kids. We then see Liv and Emma both receive marriage proposals almost simultaneously and then make a beeline to renowned wedding planner Marian St. Clair (Candice Bergen) who initially arranges separate weddings for both gals at the Plaza in June, but a clerical error finds Liv and Emma's weddings scheduled on the same day, which ignites a war between the two brides-to-be that gets WAY out of control.Clearly the inspiration for Bridezillas, there's so much that goes on here in the name of comedy that I had a hard time buying. I understand that a woman's wedding is the most important day of her life, but I would think if a woman's wedding is scheduled the same day as her BFF that, at some point, one of these women would either change the date or the venue or their wedding so that this very special day can still be their own. Is the venue and date SO important that you would destroy your best friend's day as well as your own just to have your own way?My confusion about this is addressed in the film through the two grooms- to-be (Chris Pratt, Steve Howey), who really don't understand what the fuss is about and don't get why being married at the Plaza in June is such a deal breaker. I also don't understand why the guys put up with the shenanigans that go on as long as they do.Gary Winick's direction is a little on the manic side and the screenplay by Greg DePaul and Casey Wilson (Wilson makes a cameo appearance as the bride-to-be who has stolen the date our heroines need for separate weddings) is kind of all over the place, but one thing this film does convey despite the over-the-top goings-on, is that these two women really are BFF's who would walk through fire for each other and it's interesting to see them trying to destroy each other one minute and feeling mad guilt about it the next, but does it make up for the rest of the silliness that happens here?",Bride Wars
58,ltlacey,Two friends end up having their wedding on the same day.,7,28 April 2009,"You know, even with all the This Could Never Happen blogs (wedding date mix-ups), or how stupid some said this movie was from others, I did not find this movie that bad. Maybe because I like the 2 stars well enough. Plus, I found they had good chemistry on screen. It was a simple story, and yes, some of the stunts they pulled on one another were juvenile, but I have been around enough brides-to-be, and remember my own very simple wedding, to know that as the day grows nearer, the brain cells die off. This was not a story about brides waging war on one another because they both ended up with their wedding at the same place, on the same date, and at the same time, but about what true friendship is really about. And also about the relationships we have with others. Friends, boyfriends (future husbands), boyfriends, and relatives. It's a short movie and does not take a lot of brain cells to watch. Just plain entertainment that requires no thinking, because as soon as you begin to question why or how you will ruin the experience. Just sit back and enjoy watching Hudson and Hathaway and leave it at that.",Bride Wars
59,saarvardi,"At a time when women run for Presidency and lead social revolutions, Bride Wars acts like a chauvinistic 19th century relic",4,9 January 2009,"What makes me sad about Bride Wars is the fact that it's going to make a lot of money on its opening weekend, and probably double or triple that amount throughout its run. Why anyone would want to submit himself to an over-clichéd chick flick that looks and acts like something we've all seen a million times before - only worse - is beyond me. Still, awareness seems to be sky high, with many unwilling boyfriends/husbands destined to be dragged to their local theaters by their mates.At a time where quality films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire are actually making a dent at the box-office, Bride Wars existence baffles me. The story follows two BFF (best friends forever) who decided to have a wedding in June at some fancy plaza when they were little girls. Years later, an unfortunate series of events ends in both the women - still BFF well into their twenties (like duh) - setting their wedding day on the exact same date. From here on out, it's war between the two stereotypical women (one control-freaked blonde, otherwise known as Kate Hudson; and one spineless brunette, known better as Anne Hathaway). Naturally, both ladies live in a perfect world where there's no economic depression and they can each spend an enormous amount of money on this unnecessary war of theirs. Alas, instead of being a decent display of romantic comedy, Bride Wars becomes a shallow and degrading show that implies that with all the progress the feminist movement has made during the past century, women will always be emotional and helpless beings, forever interested in superficial matters. In a time when women aim to run for Presidency and lead social revolutions, this is a real depressing conclusion. Add this to the aforementioned fact that Bride Wars utilizes every cliché in the book, and you're better off watching one of the numerous Oscar hopefuls heading your way.I gave it 4 out of 10.",Bride Wars
60,tex-42,A lost war.,2,19 January 2009,"Bride Wars in an unfunny look at what happens when two best friends who apparently want nothing out of life but to be married at the Plaza in June accidentally have their weddings scheduled for the same day. Neither Liv (Hudson) nor Emma (Hathaway) will budge on the date, so the friendship sours, and both women go completely insane in a quest to make the other miserable so they will drop out and let the other get married without the conflict.Neither Liv nor Emma are particularly sympathetic, and there is almost an undercurrent to the film that suggests both women seem most compatible with each other, rather than the men they claim to love, but this never goes anywhere. Both Liv and Emma use past misfortunes as a way to justify their behavior, and neither seems to want to admit just how out of control they are. Why anyone would want to marry either of them is never clear, particularly after Liv crazily shows up at her boyfriend's office to demand a proposal. In a late breaking subplot, Emma suddenly develops doubts about the man she has been with for ten years, and begins to fall for Liv's brother for no particular reason. One assumes this would be as close as Emma wants to come to admitting that she really just wants to marry Liv.Bride Wars is not a movie you should pay to see, but it is perfect to catch on TV when you are in the mood for something mindless.",Bride Wars
61,flapdoodle64,28 Dresses,2,15 June 2009,"This trite '27 Dresses' rip-off is a left turn in the career of Anne Hathaway, who had a string of classier movies up this point, including 'Becoming Jane' and 'Devil Wears Prada.' Hopefully, she will soon be back on track.Meanwhile, we should take just a moment to comment upon that fact Ms. Hathaway did do some good films about female empowerment, but this film is 2 steps backward. Ms. Hathaway's character in this film discovers her independence by getting drunk on tequila and doing raunchy dancing. There are 2 scenes with this behavior, and in one she is wearing a bikini top, and rubbing her body against a young man at spring break in Acupulco. In the real world, getting drunk and doing raunchy dancing against the body of a spring breaker in Mexico will not make you independent, but is instead more likely to end up with someone slipping you rufinols and you getting gang-raped by a fraternity and waking up in a hospital.Just as this film lacks the guts to challenge the herd mentality regarding the raunchy dancing fad, it also lacks the guts to challenge the bloated Cinderella wedding fantasy industry, which is helping young couples start out their family life with $20K to $50K worth of debt.Special note should be made regarding the male characters in this film: if you combine them all into one person, you'd have enough characterization to fill a 30 second promo for the upcoming weather report. In other words, a Ken doll is more interesting than these guys.Though the women don't fare much better. Candice Bergan is wasted in a role that goes nowhere. The tall chick who used to be on '3rd Rock from the Sun' pretty much steals the show, I would much rather have watched her for 2 hours, she seemed interesting.",Bride Wars

Having that said, I can now say that the story is totally uninteresting, at least for a guy (and I think for most of women as well). The conflict between the two brides has no tension, no great vengeful moments, no funny ideas, nothing (blue hair, orange skin, is that all the writers could come up with?). The war never escalates, nobody goes ballistic. If BW were a guy movie, there would be blood, guts, severed limbs, explosions. All we get in BW is nervous giggles...For a movie that i supposed to be a comedy, BW has no funny moments, no cool jokes, nada!The ending, is totally unbelievable, idiotic. And to make things worse, Kate Hudson is totally miscast in BW. My point is that BW is silly, in a bad, bad way.Waste of money and time!",Bride Wars
63,toqtaqiya2,An appealing but average romantic comedy with a lazy script.,4,24 October 2012,"Bride Wars stars Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as two brides-to-be who go to great lengths to have a wedding in June. This is the setup for a dirty war between the two friends in which they try sabotage each other's wedding. It's a cliché but then again this is obviously what people call a chick flick. Unfortunately, this war turns out to be rather uneventful. There's nothing too mean here so the worst thing that Hudson's Olivia does to Hathaway's Emma is to make her tan turn bright orange. Emma then tampers with Olivia's hair dye to turn her hair a shocking blue-white colour. The film is actually appealing though it's at best average on all fronts. Forgettable Hollywood products like Bride Wars usually get released in January. I guess the one reason to watch the film is to see Hudson and Hathaway working together. In addition, the relationships that the two women have with their fiances are handled well. One should watch the interesting Unscripted video with the two actresses on the internet in which they ask each other questions. Hathaway mentioned that she starred in Bride Wars because it includes a fight between the two brides. In conclusion, the film is light entertainment. There's nothing original about it, and it's a chick flick through and through. I must admit that I watched it because of Anne Hathaway.",Bride Wars

The story is pretty much predictable as are the laughs which weren't really funny but there were a couple of scenes that made you laugh a little. The characters were pretty much one-dimensional and cared about nothing but the wedding except for the predictable ending. The acting was okay, Anne Hathaway did a good job playing as the quiet Emma but Kate Hudson became quite annoying forty-five minutes into the movie as the bossy perfectionist Liv. The writing is same-old, same-old and has been done better a thousand times before but this isn't really a bad entry into the rom-com genre. The direction was okay, it wasn't too bad but the movie overall could have been so much better than it was.When you just hear the name of the movie Bride Wars, you know you're not in for something fantastic but it does the job it's supposed to do. The plot wasn't really very creative and was very predictable from the start, two best friends both have big dreams about getting married, both get engaged on the same day and both weddings are booked on the same day so the two brides fight about it. That's basically what the movie is but what do you expect from a movie called Bride Wars? I thought Anne Hathaway did a great job but I have seen her do bettermuch better. Kate Hudson becomes very annoying very quickly taking the bitchy role of Liv.

67,garyvanhorn,"Weddings and comedy, both gone wrong.",5,10 January 2011,"Bride Wars is almost a satire on modern weddings but doesn't have a strong enough message to fully qualify as one. Nonetheless, it is still amusing and it did make me laugh on several occasions. A pair of BFFs, Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway), are both fulfilling their lifelong dreams of getting married when an unexpected snag throws things into complete disarray. Both brides had planned on getting married at the same place on different dates, but a booking error leads to them being scheduled on the same day, at the same time. Since they planned on being in each others weddings and share a common pool of friends this is a major problem. Both women are too stubborn/proud/vain to alter their wedding plans and a small scale war breaks out as each prospective bride seeks to sabotage the wedding of the other.The methods of sabotage vary, trying to fatten the bride so she can't fit into her dress, messing with the spray tan, hair stylist mayhem, but all are actually quite amusing and if not totally believable, they are at least plausible and feel like the kinds of petty vengeance women often exact on one another. The gags were pretty funny but there was plenty of room for more. The grooms, family, and friends are largely window dressings and they might as well have not been in the movie so they felt more like props than people who could have been better utilized for more laughs.In all the movie is perfectly watchable and funny but is unremarkable.

Not only did she just do what everyone says she always does, but she kicks a guy to the curb who is smart and supportive (besides one or two scenes where he does the rational thing and calls her out on her behavior, to which literally no other person in the film close to the characters does). Why can't they agree to share the date? Why does one character HAVE to give way to the other? If anything I would have the movie go the completely opposite. Kate Hudson not necessarily dumps her fiance, but maybe in a way to not be as controlling, let's Anne Hathaway's character have her own way for once.

That pretty much tells you all you need to know.I can go for a romantic comedy every now and then, so my wife and I rented this, despite our misgivings, thinking maybe there was more to it than there seemed from the trailers. Alas, as someone pointed out earlier, the trailer contains just about the whole movie.I didn't expect great performances from either of the leads, but if nothing else, I figured, Anne Hathaway is usually at least decorative. Nope, she looks like she just escaped from a concentration camp. Kate Hudson was less scrawny, but neither more attractive nor talented.Deciding it was already too late to catch up on the plot of ""Flashpoint"", I settled in to bet with myself which groom would bolt for the door. Both (interchangeable actors A and B) spent the whole movie shaking their heads and wondering when their brides would stop acting like idiots. I picked right, by the way: the only straight single male in the whole movie (aside from the grooms, and I'm not real sure about them) was Hudson's brother. Obviously he would end up shackled to the Hathaway at the end, ergo it had to be her groom that would dodge a bullet.But that did provide at least something of a happy ending; one guy did manage to walk away from the whole mess, when Hathaway decided she couldn't settle, or he shouldn't, or... whatever, who really cares anyway? Shame the actor couldn't have avoided this mess of a movie, but that guy's going to have to take any part he can get; there aren't going to be a lot of them.Random thoughts once my mind started wandering: father-of-the-bride is on the hook for a wedding with all the trimmings at the Plaza Hotel: ""settling for less"" or not, you're marrying SOMEBODY today, daughter! Secondly, why didn't Hudson's character, supposedly a high-power attorney, sue the socks off the wedding planner whose scheduling screw-up set up the whole plot? Third, if a double wedding was so out of the question, how about just moving the start times apart by a half-hour or so? Finally, wedding planner Candice Bergen's shiny new face proves that Burt Reynold's plastic surgeon is apparently still in business, although that whole turkey-neck thing she had 20 years ago on ""Murphy Brown"" is still with her.Your pre-teen / early-teen daughter will love this flick, but guys, don't be ashamed to sneak out and go turn on ""Dirty Harry."" If your wife sits through this one, even she won't charge you any ""husband points"" for making an early escape.--------------- Bonus footage: I think the trailer for ""Legally BlondeS"", a straight-to-sales-bin DVD advertised on the ""extra features"", is placed there just to make ""Bride Wars"" seem not so crappy by comparison.",Bride Wars

Their friendship ends up being put to the test as both aren't willing to change their date and try to sabotage each other's weddings.

The characters she plays are 'frumpy', exploiting these elements, until the end when she gets some backbone. Her part in Bride Wars is a perfect example of this type of character. This movie is not an academy award nominee but it doesn't need to be. It is a sit back with chocolate and popcorn and immerse yourself in a little lighthearted escape movie. For those that need complex characters in complex movies, Hudson is a control freak whose parents cannot be at her wedding because they are dead.

I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but the way it was written did not hit home with me, the way the rest of the movie did.i can only surmise that people who hated it, found the entire thing to be what i found the last minute or two to be... a little bit too trite and neatly wrapped up.but, i am willing to let all that slide... because at the core of the movie is a good story about relationships... which is what all movies are really, even Star Wars. OK, i don't know about Hostel because i didn't see it. but Im just saying, this movie might look superficial but it is not really.i know they talk about dress designers and shoes and crap like that, but to some people, that stuff is the equivalent of the Rambo 'strapping on his weapons' scenes, or scenes in other movies where they go on and on about types of weaponry, or guns or techno babble on star trek episodes or whatever. or... sports. you all know the person who plays fantasy football and can go on for hours about it, well thats how these people are with weddings and everything that goes around weddings. but i think that is kind of the point..... the movie is not about weddings, its about the relationships between people.anyways, if you are into stuff like 27 dresses, or that movie with the t-mobile lady and the dude from 'thank you for smoking', or nanny diaries, or other stuff like that... you will probably dig it, or at least parts of it. i would even go so far as to say fans of ""meet the fockers"" might find something in this film worthwhile.now the other problem i had with the movie was envy, i envied these people with all their lifelong friendships and so forth and so on. but eventually it all breaks down and they find themselves just as lost as the rest of us... what can i say. i don't understand why people hate this movie so much, just like i don't understand why people hated the nanny diaries. oh well.",Bride Wars

81,Amonute-Matoaka,"This could have been a decent movie, they chose to be shallow.",2,11 August 2018,"I'm usually the first person aboard the ""Hollywood needs to stop ridiculing our inteligence by asuming a big wedding is all women care about"" but I actually saw potential in this film.It has 2 talented leads (both Hathaway and Hudson have proved themselves as decent actresses to say the least) and 2 main characters who have some substance, i.e. they are not just mashed up cliches. It has a premise, childhood friends get married on the same day, but loses it all, because it assumes the worst of women. Let me explain. There simply is no way two people who were selfless enough to be able to hold on to a friendship for so long, would turn against each other like hyenas over an easily solvable problem. The movie makes our characters denounce the idea of a double wedding (more to get rid of the thought in all of its viewers heads) straight away, but the thing is, two best friends like them, who do everything together, who have shared this dream all their lives, would have had a double wedding and they would have loved it.Making this about the brides being all ""this is MY day, I'M the bride"" blah, blah is what ultimately ruined the movie. Because from being a movie celebrating friendship, it turned into a parade of selfishness and shallowness, not because it didn't have a choice, but because this is what the men who made this film think about women like their central characters, and that's just sad.The cleansing comes too late in the film to salvage it, as far as I'm concerned. The fact that these two inteligent women come to the same conclusion we came to 5 minutes in the film, that they are sharing their lives together, but only do so at the very end of the film makes for a sadly torpid script.One last thought: the amount of concealed evil exhibited in the ugly games the two best friends played against each other is not telling of feminine nature but, again, it is telling of what the men who wrote this script think about women.

The film also feels a bit short to me. The girls make up too quickly. I'd have liked to see them fight dirty, ripped off clothes, some cropping but I guess you can't see that on PG-13.I like Kate Hudson's tough look. Hathaway looks a bit too harmless.

83,fishfryluv2,"I'm Pregnant! No way, I'm pregnant! We're both PREGNANT!",3,28 March 2018,"So this movie was on TBS a few weeks ago, and my wife and I flipped to it to watch the last 15 minutes of it. I had never seen it before, but my wife had. She quickly walked me through the storyline of this Oscar-nominee, right up to the point where Anne Hathaway is walking down the aisle when a home movie of her acting drunk was projected above the alter. I guess this was all Kate Hudson's doing, and, since Kate Hudson was getting married across the hall at the same hotel, and walking down the aisle at the same time, Anne Hathaway decided to run over to Kate Hudson's wedding and beat the tar out of her. I have to admit, it was pretty entertaining. However, Anne Hathaway stopped beating up Kate Hudson when she realized that they were best friends. Makes sense. Anne Hathaway then got up and dumped her fiance at Kate Hudson's wedding. I guess beating up your best friend at her wedding can really make you realize that you don't love the man who proposed to you.Anyways, the biggest mystery for me was, if they are best friends, don't they have mutual friends? And if so, which wedding did their mutual friends attend? To me it seems terrible to make your friends choose sides and miss one wedding. And that, to me, makes Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson two of the worst human beings to ever live on this planet.The only reason my wife and I watched was to get to the last part where bother Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson meet for lunch a year later and reveal to each other that they are both pregnant, and their babies are due on the same day!!!!! (cue screaming) While this may seem improbably to the casual movie-goer (wedding on the same day AND a baby on the same day??!?!?), this scenario is actually quite common. According to the internet, it happens to pairs of best friends approximately 700 times every year. So I am glad that a movie was finally made to bring this common problem to the mainstream. With increased awareness, we can stamp out this problem for good. Thanks to Bride Wars, lives will be saved. Huzzah!Anne Hathaway was also in the movie ""Interstellar"".",Bride Wars
84,coloradokid719,I will not apologize ...,10,10 September 2011,"I refuse to apologize for liking this movie! It's sad to read so many scathing reviews, when this film is what it sets out to be, a whimsical, lighthearted look at lifelong best friends who end up with their weddings booked on the same day, by mistake. It might seem formulaic, but I found some of the twists and turns refreshing and unexpected. There are also some poignant (if not entirely deep) dramatic moments which lend strength to the characters and the storyline. Granted, I could see the aforementioned ""love triangle"" forming, but it wasn't a slap in the face. Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson are, in my opinion, great in this film, and I also enjoyed seeing Steve Howey in something beyond ""Reba,"" which I also enjoy. Steve's character was excellent and he portrayed him perfectly, with humor, sensitivity, and depth. Bryan Greenberg, as Kate Hudson's brother, was a delightful surprise.This is a fun, tongue-in-cheek movie and I found it completely enjoyable ... well, with perhaps the exception of Kristen Johnson's ""Deb,"" but her character was more annoying than truly disruptive. If you're jaded and cynical, you might not enjoy this film, but I enjoyed it just as much as ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" I hope you will, too.",Bride Wars
85,the_glorious_sob,attractive actresses + attractive idea = underwhelming but tolerable comedy,6,1 June 2014,"I'm watching the film on DVD a 2nd time so I can stay focused & motivated when writing this review. Many reviews of ""Bride Wars"" were negative although I don't think this comedy is as offensive to critics as such a movie starring Adam Sandler. I had some interest in this movie because I find Anne Hathaway & Kate Hudson 2 b attractive, & the idea of them sharing a movie also sounded attractive. The problem was that the other rudimentary elements of the movie (e.g. writing & directing) fell flat. Honestly, I watched the entire movie w/ Spanish subtitles & French dubbing because I heeded those bad reviews. I did notice the hackneyed tropes such as Motown music in the score, the sitcomish pranks like the blue hair & the ""broken Aesop"" of Emma & Liv walkin' down the aisle proudly in spite of one of the brides becoming a ex-fiancée in front of many silent witnesses. (Why the hell was the place that quiet?) & the notion of the protagonists sharing a do d8 4 their children was an obvious sequel bait that nobody chose to byte. Notable actors include many who were in sitcoms, starting w/ 5x-Emmy winner Candice Bergen of ""Murphy Brown,"" Kristen Johnston of ""3rd Rock from the Sun,"" John Pankow of ""Mad About You,"" Casey Wilson of ""Happy Endings,"" & a pre-famous Chris Pratt from ""Parks & Recreation""; he plays one of the grooms, but his role as the groom seems to be a plot placeholder. I think when he did become well-known, what should've been in this movie would be equal to Chris' appearance in ""The Five-Year Engagement."" Oh yes; ""Bride Wars"" is rated PG. I think that also seriously hurt audiences by depriving the movie of its bite by lessening any S-words & partial nudity. In conclusion, I rate ""Bride Wars"" 6 outta 10. I normally rate worse A-movie comedies at 4 or 5, but for just looking at the two stars Kate and Anne, I allow a 6th star. If I genuinely liked this film, I'd rate it 7; 8 would be ludicrous.",Bride Wars
86,ethal-10611,Just plain terrible...,1,28 October 2018,"Generally, you want the audience to sympathize with and root for your movie's protagonists. Bride Wars however, features two of the most unlikeable main characters ever put on screen. Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway take every negative stereotype about women and dial it up to 11. You really just find yourself pitying the poor men who somehow agreed to marry them, one of whom is played by Chris Pratt. It's easy to see how he was able to work fearlessly alongside deadly velociraptors in Jurassic World. That seems like an absolute cakewalk compared to putting up with Anne Hathaway's complete sociopath of a character.

Having now seen it myself, I see exactly where he was coming from. This is a horrible, horrible movie. There is nothing at all good about it.The plot is totally nonsensical. Two best friends getting their weddings booked on the same day, and immediately turning on each other with pranks and sabotage efforts? How does that sound like a good movie concept? But many things combine to ensure that nothing can be salvaged from this awful premise. It's no good as a comedy: none of the jokes are funny. The acting is as bland as it gets. And the characters themselves are wholly unlikeable: they are just selfish, two-dimensional people who have skewed priorities and are never properly called on it, and it is impossible to understand just why they're being so horrible to each other.Regardless of your gender, do not watch this movie.",Bride Wars

Well, it looks like their dream is finally coming true as their boyfriends have popped the question and now all that's left to do is book the venue. But, unfortunately, due to a mistake the venue made, they've booked their weddings on the same day and the next opening isn't until June 15th... 3 years from now. When they both refuse to move their wedding, it turns to ""war"".But, that's just it, the only ""war"" was in the trailer (the bronze tan, the blue hair, etc.) and the movie overall was rather average. I went in with an open mind and low expectations and still came out disappointed. The first hour is OK, but the last half takes a completely different turn. The jokes stop and it becomes more serious; focusing on the two girls' relationship more than anything else.The movie appeals mostly to teen girls, so if you're anyone else, this isn't really worth the admission price.

92,tchockythegreat,Not over-the-top enough,3,17 May 2009,"After reading the reviews for this film, most of which were, to put it nicely, largely negative, I came under the impression that this movie was going to be the cinematic equivalent of being forced to watch someone kill your dog right after they were done eating your firstborn child. But after looking at the cover of the DVD package and seeing the films two leading ladies (one of whom is one of my favorite actresses) smiling and looking heart-breakingly radiant, I thought to myself, could the film really be THAT bad? The answer to that question: Yes...and no.Make no mistake about it: Bride Wars is a complete and utter piece of celluloid trash. It's both a poorly-scripted attempt at satirizing the Bridezilla phenomenon and a poorly-scripted fable about the unbreakable bonds of true friendship. It's told with one-dimensional characters and enough clichés to fill the Grand Canyon.So, why don't I find myself hating this film as much as I should be? The sad truth is, there is just enough good about this film to make me realize that there is a truly hilarious comedy buried somewhere in this mess of a film.The biggest problem I have with this film is its insistence on trying to come off at times as being a semi-serious film about friendship and the perils of romance. The fact is, the writing and performances in this film are simply not strong enough for anyone to take the film's periodic attempts at being earnest seriously, especially after considering how over-the-top the actions of the two main characters are.Which segues into the other major problem I have with this movie. The screenwriters were pulling their punches far too often with the comedy; as if they were too afraid of being so over-the-top that nobody would take their film seriously. The fact is, no one was rightly going to watch a film titled ""Bride Wars"" expecting it to be sincere, heartwarming social commentary. While some critics have, understandably, harshly condemned this movie for making its main characters seem like shallow caricatures who are disturbingly obsessed with the superficial aspects of their respective weddings, I believe that these criticisms are overblown and assume too much about the apparent progressiveness of our society. The fact is, humans can be absurdly obsessed with the superficial at times, and just because this movie overblows this concept a bit does not automatically make the film wrong just because the main characters happen to be women.That said, this movie was at its best when it was at its most over-the-top. For example, seeing Anne Hathaway's character walk around the busy streets of New York with a beyond-gaudy pumpkin-orange tan as a result of a prank pulled by Kate Hudson's character was goofy and fun, and I think that the writers could have done more with that circumstance than what they conjured up. The same could be said about a number of other parts in the film where the main characters were acting spiteful towards each other, such as Hudson and Hathaway's showdown at the bachelorette party and the climactic cat-fight between the two during the wedding ceremony. Both scenes were well-conceived but ultimately came up short in terms of just how fun they wound up being, especially after considering the comedic talents of both Hudson and Hathaway. I can only wonder just how crazy these scenes and others in the movie could have been had the writers had enough guts to admit to themselves that the insanity in the film was its best aspect, gone for broke, and made the feud between the two ladies truly rambunctious and demented. This unwillingness to be truly zany extends to the characters themselves, as the writers are either unable or unwilling to let the characters embrace their inner caricature to a point in which the film's comedy might have taken flight.For what it's worth, Hudson and Hathaway (both of whom are shot by the cinematographer in a manner that makes them glow a bit) do the best they can with what they have to work with, with Hathaway's performance a bit more well-rounded due to her character actually being given a chance to develop somewhat. The chemistry between the two is a bit hit-and-miss, but generally they play off each other pretty well. Her annoying voice-over narration of the film aside, Candice Bergen does a decent job with her control-freak wedding planner character, while Kristen Johnston's performance as Hathaway's lousy co-worker is memorable mainly for being irritating and unfunny. The rest of the performances in the movie are thankless and forgettable.When all is said and done, the film's insistence on not embracing its inner cartoon winds up costing it dearly in the fun department. What results is a bland, inoffensive chick flick that, at best, might make a decent rental for a young bride or bride-to-be willing to stomach its saccharine sentimentality and its half-baked characters and attempts at humor.",Bride Wars
93,s-wesner1,SNARKY film for a SNARKY World....:),8,8 October 2012,"Starring: Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson These two FEMME-FATALES, in distress, are desperate to boot. However, they have been desperate as the film notes quite cutely from the beginning of the film, to get married from the time that they were six, and best rich buddies who frequented the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria together with their moms for tea and brunch-time. The two quite adorably played ""bride and groom"" games, though not with any inappropriate over-tones, in the attic of one of their parents' house, when around the same age; coached by their moms that marriage was the best way to go (as if there were any other way; the film takes an old-fashioned view-point), the two are remarkable in their steadfast belief that, indeed, marriage is the best way to get someone to rely on you, and you on they, forever and ever, 'till death do us part. The quaint old phrase, ""something old something new, something borrowed something blue"" is used to show the film's exquisitely doll-like vision of marriage; in this day and age, with things not turning out perfectly as they should half the time, it is a wonder that they pulled together this altogether believable, yet somewhat superficial film, for our times. The girls grow up to be somewhat selfish, busy professionals, one of them a supposed lawyer who spends half the time talking on her phone; while the other is a middle- school teacher (Anne Hathaway), and the one friend opines that ""middle school is a jungle"" sympathizing with her friend who has to deal with rowdy almost-teenagers. In addition, we find that, the two, while tightly bonded in their beautiful friendship, share jealousy issues whenever the topic of marriage, which brought them together in the first place, is broached. When the brunette protagonist gets engaged before her blond one (played by Kate Hudson), then it is clear that there is a storm on the horizon. Besides the fact that both ideally want to get married at once, to lessen the jealous tension, they both know how badly, and, to be honest, how downright desperate they are to prove someone wants to marry them, each other really is. Liv and Emma are the names of these two beauties, who truly want to get married (other aspirations in their lives aren't thoroughly explored; this is a film about weddings, after all); and then we learn who is more desperate when the ""friends"" cast threatening glances at one another, almost claw at each other's faces to grab the suspected engagement ring away when it appears that one of the girl's boyfriend's has left them a ring in a Tiffany box (it turns out that the ring was a booby trap; set up so that the girl would think that she was about to be asked to be married, her fiancée tricks her later into thinking that he actually wasn't proposing, but then chides her for her ""poor faith"" because, yes, all along, he had been planning it, but was doubted that her impatience, which wasn't a virtue, would allow her to wait long enough to get into the right mood and the right moment). Is this clear? Anyway, she literally jumps up on him like an ""inappropriately in-love"" monkey who is showing off that she can do gymnastics for the first time, and then they are officially engaged (with this ring, I thee wed, are almost the words one can hear off into the distance). Anne Hathway's beau plans the romantic event somewhat differently; he creatively offers the girl of his dream her beautiful ring (and her best friend asks her all about it; what carat is it? Is it wide? What color is it? Weight, length, and luster? Brand? Country of origin? And so on...) in a fortune cookie, and after some confusion about who takes which cookie (as she doesn't know the significance of this ritual at this particular time), later on following up the act with the traditional, resounding words to every woman's ears: ""Will you marry me?"" The two hug then, and, might I add that they are a better-fitting, match-made-in-heaven couple than most, including that of Liv and her beau (they seem ill-paired, and not a good match, at all). So there you have it, two desperate women, who appear to have it all, suddenly both have husbands; now, what's the problem?! What more could they want, right? Therein lies the dilemma of the movie, the plot-line, the very heart of the matter: both of them want to reserve (quite stupidly, in the eyes of many) weddings in the same place, at the same exact time. So, you have two desperate, bimbo-y girls, who won't give in; sounds like a recipe for a cat-fight, to me. Neither one wants to admit she made a mistake, and neither one wants to be later than the other in terms of getting married. It's silly, really, but somebody has to make us laugh. So, then you have the two girls tearing each other down, and an accident happens which makes Emma scream (her hair-dresser has dyed her hair blue). . . . . (She screams bloody murder, wanting to kill the one who made this glitch in her plans, though, in all reality, she can really just simmer down, because, blond dye is available to dye it back, again, honey). In the end, there are plenty more antics where those came from from the two prom-queens from hell, and we find that immaturity never ends, even when you are in your thirties and ready to settle down, apparently. I guess that what makes the film such a winner is that it follows so logically: of course, the two ""bride-zillas"" would be at each other's throats, because, both of them caught the bouquet at one of their SNARKY, sneaky, and competitive (and backstabbing) friend's weddings, at the very same time!!!!!",Bride Wars
94,hudiefanny,Friendship between Girls,4,5 April 2009,"When I finished watching the movie ""Bride Wars"", I commented it on our school bbs. I said that the fights against each other between the two women were so horrible. A male friend claimed that the conflicts of young ladies in another movie ""Mean Girls"" were even more terrifying. Therefore, I've found the movie and looked it through.However, I still stick to my point that the first one seems more pathetic to me. Frequently in life, who hurts you most is not your biggest enemy but one of those that you think are your bosom friends. This is partly because these people possess of wider knowledge about you, your secrets, your weaknesses, and everything else. Moreover, the betrayal of whom you really care about itself can be a huge hit to your nerves.According to my previous experiences, it gets even worse among girls due to their human nature. Male creatures are comparatively more independent. Men enjoy their relations with their soccer pals, hang-round buddies, working partners. They rely on each other, help each other when it is necessary; and go out together for a drink sometimes. But they seldom share their deepest feelings with one another. A man, for instance, would hardly consult another for his troubles of getting along with his girlfriend.Friendship between girls is quite different from that between boys. Girls are willing to share almost whatever they have with their girl mates. They talk about every detail in life all the time on phone, face to face, over a cup of tea, when shopping together or during the sleepover time. It's so natural for a girl to offer her own lip-care stick when she sees her friend's lips are dry. And it's common for a girl to open up with her friends about all the freaky habits of the bastard she's dating for the moment. When a girl takes you as her true friend, you could definitely expect that she would try everything she could and use every single piece of her resources to help you out when you're in trouble, while male friends tend to give you a hand only when you ask and at the cost they could afford without any impact to their normal life. I'm not trying to accuse men of being unhelpful or indifferent. They are just more rational and would consider more about their duties to their own families and others that they're supposed to be responsible to.Up to now, you might assume my point is that true friendship only happens or say has more possibilities to occur in girls' world. Please don't take it wrong. That's not what I'm saying. Women are sensitive and easy to go extreme. They can be as strong hating you as they are loving you. Liv and Emma in ""Bride Wars"" are very good example of its kind. I'm not surprised why and how they did it. Not at all. The only thing astonishing me is that they finally forgave each other and got their friendship back. They let everything go just as it never happened and became closest friends again.I can hardly believe this. And I've never seen this in reality before. I don't know whether it is faked out in movies or other fictional works or it does happen in the west. But I do hope for its existence anyway.Friendship's excessively fragile, maybe frailer than true love, I guess. However, the frailty and rarity make it even more precious.",Bride Wars

There were no strip club bachelor/bachelorette parties, no fights that left you hating both of the women in the movie, and some pretty good acting. However,in Bride Wars, Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway have reached a low point in their career, dreadfully overacting and dramatizing every little detail to the point of me losing interest. The three male leads were decent, but for the most part, left a lot to be desired. Their characters were somewhat shallow, possibly due to a predictable and weak screenplay and script.

Although I wanted to watch it, mainly because of Anne Hathaway. I was told she is a good actress and is playing quite good in that movie. Well I can partly agree with that. Her performance in ""Bride Wars"" was surely satisfactory, however I believe her role was not really challenging. For the rest, I have to confess that the story of the movie is quite poor. It is obvious that the idea of the movie is to show us how two childhood friends deal with their friendship when their most desired dream seems to come true. However this appears unrealistic in the movie. Two best friends who know each other for over twenty years wouldn't try to spoil each others lives. ""Bride Wars"" appears also not that funny as it probably should be.

103,guywhoreviewsmovies,"Plot Hole Ruins Film -- Sadly, it's no Dark Knight",2,14 January 2009,"Bride Wars is a romantic comedy about a classic American rite of passage: the battle between two best friends who, through circumstances far beyond their control, can only get married on the same day for some reason.Let me just say that I have been excited to see this movie since before it was even announced. On opening night, I arrived at the theatre promptly at midnight in my bride costume. Sadly, I must report that I was among the few that actually took the extra step to dress up. Apparently, wearing costumes to opening night is a dying tradition in American culture, because if you're not getting in costume for Bride Wars, what are you holding out for? Your own wedding? Please. Nobody is going to see that.As much as I wanted this film to be the next Dark Knight, there was an obvious plot hole that was impossible to overlook. Frankly, it ruins the entire movie. I was actually embarrassed to be wearing the bridal gown when the movie was over.The dramatic conflict is created by the two best friends who want to get married on the same day. The question burning in the audience's collective mind is: why doesn't one bride simply kill the other?If Hollywood and MTV have taught us anything (and they have taught us everything), it is that weddings are the single most important thing to any woman, ever. Weddings trump money, love, new shoes, children, and most of all, friendship. Weddings are the only thing that gives a woman meaning in her shallow, shoe-centric life.In fact, I only know of one girl who would not murder her best friend if her friend was preventing her from having her wedding on a specific day (and that's only because she has no friends). Back me up on this, ladies.I know what you're going to say: "" Tom, I agree with everything you just said, but if one of the brides killed the other one, the movie would have been too short."" Maybe you are right, Faceless-Reader-of-this-Blog. But at least it would have been real. It would have been so easy for them to do it, too. A mail bomb, poison, hire a hit-man, poison-by-mail, or scissors to the back of the head while they were clipping wedding coupons.Another solution would be for one of the brides to kill the other's groom (no groom = no marriage). The consequences of this would have created a deliciously dramatic situation, as it would leave a vengeful, fiancé-less woman, who would crash the other girl's wedding drunk, and right before the vows, telling everyone ""You know what, she killed my fiancé? Whaddaya think about that?"" Or she might pay a homeless man $20 to marry her, and continue with the wedding as planned, just out of spite.You see, faithless readers, there is plenty of drama in reality. Hollywood has no need to insult us with such contrived endings, such as the two girls resolving their differences and becoming friends again in the end. No more, Hollywood! We want real!

104,dancergalchick14,"this is a chick flick/comedy, but overall so good i would watch it again",8,4 December 2009,"i loved this movie, i saw this movie when it came out on DVD,because of Kate Hudson, i had recently saw how to lose a guy in 10 days from my sister and loved that movie. when i saw this movie i thought it would be so funny,it didn't really have that many funny parts, there was a couple, me and my sister were cracking up when Kate woke up in the morning and her hair was blue and she went to work because she forgot to get it dyed back to blond,and she used her shirt and wrapped it around her head so the people she was working with wouldn't see her blue hair, and so during her meeting all she had on was her pants a suit jacket and her bra,and it was so funny.then when the shirt fell off her head and she was telling the people that she was fighting with her best friend and everything and then she sat down and she ripped of part of her hair and was like ""oh my god i'm gonna be a bald bride""that was funny....it is a chick flick/comedy, for that reason it was good and i would totally watch it again. but its not like one of those comedy's where you are gonna keep laughing",Bride Wars
105,eph-19195,Definitely a classic film.,9,11 June 2020,"Definitely a must watch classic. Kate Hudson takes the lead( sorry Anne Hathaway fans, didn't mean any disrespect) in this movie. Her presence itself as a friend who can be a nasty enemy is compelling. Anne is great, Chris Pratt is good, but Kate is the best. The direction and casting crew - hats off! They brought the best out of the 2 of the best actresses in the industry. Acting, script, with little or no plot holes, music being apt, screenplay and fight scenes. Worth a great watch. Sad Kate didn't win an Oscar.😔😔",Bride Wars
106,cos0591,Two Brides and a Boring Movie,4,1 May 2009,"This movie does not have much to offer. I rented it thinking it would be a cute ""chick flick"", but I was very disappointed. I loved ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", ""Muriel's Wedding"", ""27 Dresses"", etc., but ""Bride Wars"" was a mistake. Humor was non-existent, plot was stupid, and I had trouble staying awake. Ann Hathaway is an attractive and talented actress and I've always enjoyed her in her previous movies, but even she couldn't salvage this stinker. I found Kate Hudson annoying. Candice Bergen is always great, but she didn't appear enough to be significant. Pre-teen females might possibly like parts of this movie, but overall, I don't think there is really any target audience for this film. Do not waste your time.",Bride Wars
107,ef_wells,Clearly written by a man,2,16 September 2018,The premise is terrible. Only a man would think that something so frivolous would turn life long friends against each other.,Bride Wars
108,sentance2006,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still worth a watch",5,16 June 2009,"I must admit, being English I thought that I would jump at the opportunity to see a good chick flick that didn't involve Hugh Grant. Although anything with him not in it has already scored marks in my book! The film itself features two brides, Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Ann Hathaway) who are both the best of friends. When they happen to book their dream weddings on the same day, at the same venue, everything turns sour. This film has a good, solid, yet slightly predictable script, and a good cast.It doesn't show either Kate Hudson or Ann Hathaway off at their best, but it does bring in some pint sized laughter and the odd sigh as you feel sorry for either of the women.If you want to see a reasonably good chic flick, then this is for you :)",Bride Wars
109,ladygaga8781,"Not that good, but at least it was original",5,22 May 2010,"Of all the chic flicks that came out in 2009, this was probably the most original one. Gone is the sappy romance between guy and gal. Gone are the one-night stands, overbearing families that complicate relationships, and unintended romances. This movie is simply about two girls, best friends since childhood, who by accident have their weddings scheduled on the same day at the same place. They then proceed to destroy each other as a way of getting the other one to postpone the wedding. Would something like this ever happen in real life? Probably not, but the movie does seem believable, and the comedy is actually quite good. So overall, an enjoyable 1.5 hours of time in front of the TV.",Bride Wars
110,closetedtomato,Absolutely horrible,2,4 January 2012,"I gave this movie a 2 because the cast was fine. They did not act horribly, but this movie is downright horrible. Absolutely ghastly. I would have elaborated had I not been limited by my non-existent vocabulary.In fact, it was so bad that I never finished it. And thank the heavens, I knew when to stop. The movie was alright at first, when it was just bickering and mutual cat-fighting, but soon it turned into chaosfest with women of marriageable age acting like children. Not entertaining at all, and I feel bad for the people who actually spent the money to watch it in theaters. After a while, you start to grasp hold of the fact that this movie manages to lower your IQ with each passing second.All that said, I must reiterate that I did not finish this movie. I was in about 50 minutes to an hour before deciding that this film would have the honour of being the first one(and of now, the only one) that I stopped halfway. It was that bad. While it is possible that it ends on a great note and manages to make up for all the suffering before, no one is still going to bother if it takes that long.",Bride Wars
111,allanah-64973,Classic Chick Flick,6,14 September 2019,"The perfect movie for a girls night in, or to keep on in the background as you do other things. Predictable plot, little character development, but it still makes me smile every time.",Bride Wars
112,allyeshua,I enjoyed it!,9,21 August 2020,"I'm a fan of both Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson. I think they were both great. The plot was light, funny, and a bit predictable, but I'd recommend this movie to anyone.",Bride Wars
113,blueviolet-2,Not that bad,7,16 May 2009,"I think the message behind this movie was that friends should come first, not weddings. Yes, there are some plot holes, but as a newlywed I could definitely relate to all the pre-wedding stress and hype. I also believe that the point of this movie was to make fun of America's obsession with ""the perfect wedding day"", which it did, quite well. Hudson and Hathaway played their respective bridezilla characters hilariously; I got a kick out one of the first scenes with the wedding planner (Bergen), where she asked the brides-to-be if they wanted to consult their grooms about the wedding date and they both said, ""No."" True, it is a pretty predictable film, but I felt that it was entertaining and worth the 5-dollar rental fee. 7 out of 10.",Bride Wars
114,vachanj,Fun movie to watch with your spouse or prospective spouse.,8,17 June 2009,"Let me tell you that the movie is not as bad as what is said in the other reviews. The movie is full of sequences you can laugh at / with. I agree that the story line is not for someone expecting complicated scenarios and plots but a simple story line with lots of things you can laugh about. Also, the movie is a perfect chick-flic, so if your girlfriend or wife is into these kinda movies then Bride Wars would be an excellent choice for a light entertainment. If you are critically looking at the movie to see what you can gain emotionally or intellectually, then, I can say the movie really brings out the differences between guys and girls and the issues that could bring in misunderstandings.I am not a guy who usually enjoys such movies but surprisingly enjoyed the light hearted comedy in this movie with my wife and two other couples. Though you cannot expect anything very exciting or mind-boggling, the movie is a good entertainer for people who like to go to the movies without stressing their minds.",Bride Wars
115,bphud88,It's Cute!,10,14 January 2009,OK so it may not be Oscar worthy or golden globe worthy but anytime you get two mega stars (kate and Anne) together you are going to have box office gold. It is a cute simple movie that is great for first dates. Anyone can enjoy a good light hearted chick flick i personally miss the how to loose a guy in 10 days kind of movies there what make us feel happy ....with everything going on in the world why shouldn't we have the right to make a film like this? I loved it and so did all my friends i don't think it deserves 10 stars but the rating is low so anything to pull that up. Good job guys and clever idea on making two life long friends trying savotage each others wedding. I personally love the tanning part. I laughed out loud in the movie several times. I loved it and the general audience if they know good comedy they'll love it too.,Bride Wars

117,hollys-little-sister,The most Hilarious Rom-Com I've ever seen!,10,13 June 2011,"I rated this 10/10 because it is the best film i have ever watched! It's a hilarious Romantic Comedy I've ever seen in my whole life!Kate Hudson plays Liv is a stylish blonde with a successful career as a lawyer, Then there's Emma played by Anne Hathaway who's a brunette she is a teacher. There the best of friends and have always dreamed of having their wedding in June at the plaza, when Liv finds a ring in her wardrobe and thinks it must be from her perfect boyfriend tells all her friends she engaged without checking with him first. Than Emma gets engaged from her boyfriend, Liv finds out the ring is from her perfect boyfriend and now their both engaged! Life is so wonderful for them as their both each other maid-of-honer's. But when they go shopping for a dress both girls have an eye on one perfect dress. Emma lets Liv have the dress, as shes going to wear her mum's dress. But when they find out their wedding is on the same day at the same time it's war! Emma mixes up Liv's hair colour with a grey/blue colour. And Liv changes the spray on tan 'honey glow' for a 'pumkin orange.' On the day of their weddings, Emma's is ruined by Liv and Emma's fiancé dumps her right when Emma runs screaming out of her wedding and into Liv's only to jump on her back when she is walking down the isle. Liv feels sorry for her but the best of friends realise how stupid thieve been and become friends for Liv's wedding. Three months later and Emma is married to Liv's brother!The best part of the film is at the end when they meet up and go..... Liv: Do you want some wine? Emma: No, thanks i don't drink. Liv: Me too *both look at each other* Emma & Liv: When are you due?! Emma: 6th of June Liv: Mee too!I started laughing so hard all the way through this i bought it on DVD and have watched it many times! Defianatly one for the girls. I would recommend this too everyone! It is a fantastic film.",Bride Wars
118,steph_0213,Nott hat bad what were people waiting for?,7,21 January 2009,"I saw this movie yesterday,even after reading some comments on this site. I found it pretty good.it's certainly not the movie of the year,but since when a comedy is?The movie is light and there are some funny moments. If you're looking for something light to watch, something just for not thinking for 90 minutes, then it's that kind of movie. I don't know what people here were awaiting for this movie?Something that would make your brain working?If yes, well they were wrong go seeing this movie. It's not Davinci Code. This movie is about two young girls dreaming of a wedding in a hotel in particular. I think the movie just shows what some little girls, when kids, were dreaming of.I think, few or many years ago, it was common to see little girls dreaming of it and maybe the movie just shows the audience what was once a dream and now with the society,well the wedding is getting a bit something people forget about,the true goal of it maybe.There might be parts of the movie that married people would find funny as maybe it was their case. I'm not talking about all the bi***y parts of it between the two girls of the movie!Yes there are some cruels pranks and some are like ""come on!idiot!""and you're starting a bit to think that it's a bit over exaggerated about all the pranks.But it also showed, above all these cruel and stupid pranks, what even best friend can do to the other one. I didn't think the acting was bad. In fact,it's a C-O-M-E-D-Y!Not a big drama or action movie or something like that!I think the acting was good and I personally don't really look at the acting when I watch a movie,I'm more interested about the movie and what's happening than the acting,except if it's a really bad acting like in some movies I saw and forgot the tittle. So I think, to have a clear opinion on that movie,you should go and see it by yourself and make you own opinion than making your own only by reading the comments. It's not a big theater movie and it will probably stay a long time so maybe wait for it to come on DVD if you're not sure about seeing it or not.",Bride Wars
119,kimberleyhurst-37988,Fab!,10,9 March 2015,"Anne Hathaway is one of my favourite actresses and I loved her in this. I love weddings and wedding films (The Wedding Singer, The Wedding Planner, 27 Dresses) I could go on. I loved absolutely everything about this film. I loved how the story was told by the wedding planner in this film and rotated around each character. You could see the girls were a great partnership in this film. I haven't seen Kate Hudson in much before so wasn't really sure about her, but she was so good in this film. I loved her comedy she and Anne's character bounced of each other. I really enjoyed it when they were getting at each other, blue hair, bright orange tan and other things. I cried, and that's a sign to me that a film is good. If a film toys with my emotions then I know it's been a good one. I tell you the truth though; I wasn't expecting the surprise at the end. Both married, both pregnant, both due on the exact same date. Great film and would recommend it to everyone I know.",Bride Wars
120,lathespianage,perfect!!!!,8,30 January 2009,"I read a review on the main page where it criticizes Bride Wars' frivolity and how it was, to roughly quote, ""amazed that movies of its kind still exist."" I am too, but I'm GLAD they do exist. This movie was the epitome of a chick flick made to be watched periodically by women everywhere with their girlfriends on a Friday night with a sizable bowl of incredibly unhealthy popcorn.Look, I love dramatic, political statement-making, Oscar-nominated films as much as the next movie geek. But if that was what all the movies made were like, I'd stop watching them altogether. That isn't the point of movies. Movies are meant to reach as many different human emotions as they can, and you know what? Sometimes I don't want to be serious. Sometimes I want to let loose and have some fun and be able to relate to some women on the screen who are simple, every day women NOT out to win the presidency or beat men in the boxing ring. Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway touched me with their believable performances as two best friends who shared a dream together and ended up with their friendship triumphing over petty superficiality and disputes. Judge it all you want, but there are some girls still today who DO want the perfect wedding, who DO maintain friendships through the years and who DO remain as close as they were on day one 20 years ago.Maybe neither Hudson or Hathaway's characters were superwomen who conquered the world in some way or the other. But I saw in them so many facets common to all sorts of different women out there that it doesn't matter. I don't know about you, but the women I know ARE struggling to maintain a good image of self-control when they sometimes want the burden lifted just a bit and relax, and other women I know ARE also struggling to bust out of the monotonous, pushover state that they've succumbed to to please other people. These are, despite their airbrushed appearances and ultimate-movie-fantasy lifestyles, representative of the common woman. So screw you if you think you're too good for this movie. To me, that makes you either a disgruntled man, a woman with no sense of humour or emotion who needs to attain both, or someone who should watch it again with a better perspective on what the movie's really out there to do.It may be no Slumdog Millionaire, but it IS a simple and classic story about love, individuality, and most of all, friendship. And the more you think of it as such and not compare it to overdone dramas in the movie field, you will appreciate it for all its moral undertones and encouragement of jocularity in life and enjoying it with all the important people around you ... as well as its fun, momentary entertainment. I wish there were MORE of these movies out there to remind us all that not everything has to be about politics or social issues nowadays. That morality can be encouraged without having it come extra gritty and shoved down your throat. That we don't have to mature so fast and become unimaginative adults without any more comedy or absurdity left from our childhoods. That fantasies are still allowed in this cold, hard world and that little girls can grow into their own woman who WILL find happiness in the end. We deserve to dream.8 out of 10 stars for a lovable, refreshing, and relatable movie well done.",Bride Wars
121,underwearpjs,Its OK.,6,2 May 2009,"Bride Wars isn't the best movie out there, but its not terrible. I will admit the only way you will enjoy this movie is if you really enjoy chick flicks. This is not a movie for manly guys or girls at all. I think it has an interesting plot and very slight humor. Its one of the movies you see just to entertain yourself for a short while. Even though there is nothing spectacular about it I found it entertaining enough that I was satisfied with my On Demand purchase. Its no almost award winning movie such as Anne Hathaway's Rachel Getting Married, but its still fun to see. Sometimes its good to see a movie where you don't have to think or feel so many emotions as in a deep movie. It has a predominantly light tone throughout the movie that leaves you happy all the way through. Its a one time movie for me and its forgettable, but its entertaining enough for the moment.",Bride Wars
122,candypeggy52,It's a touching movie to me,10,17 April 2010,"I watched this movie because I have to do my presentation. But after I watch this movie, it is totally a touching movie to me. It is a movie that is talking about two best friends who met each other when they are very little and became the lifelong's best friends. And they all dreamed of having a wonderful wedding at plaza hotel in June. After they were engaged, they began to prepare their wedding happily. Due to the mistake of the wedding planner, they had to have the wedding at the same day. And they began their wars! In the process they fight with each other, they gradually know that the important of friends. And the ending of this movie is very touching. They made up with each other. By watching this movie that I realize friendship is a necessary thing in our life and we have to cherish it. In this movie, we can saw the process two brides they prepared. It's one of the part I like. I can see the happiness on their faces. In the process, I can learn from it that how we can prepare for our wedding. It interesting that they fight with each other, because they try to destroy each other's wedding and have do a lot of interesting things. But at the ending, they all married with their love and pregnant. It's really a happy thing in a woman's life.I really like this movie.",Bride Wars

The movie met up to everyone's expectations.Movie started off grabbing everyone's attention like having the perfect friends relationship. Then everything changed. They did a great job of keeping the audiences attention throughout the movie and keeping everyone interested the whole time.The whole movie had laughter, arguments, tension and fun! It is a good clean movie that's good for all ages. It will bring laughter to everyone, even the men. Everyone sitting around us enjoyed the movie and they ranged in ages from young teenagers to older seniors.I give it a 9/10 as it put a smile on my girlfriends and I face and everyone else's in the theater when we left.The movie was easy on the mind and I would definitely recommenced it.",Bride Wars

We are not led to believe this is going to be anything more than that and it was well done. Great job Kate, Annie and the cast. Adorable little girl friendship. Those were such great picks for the Young Liv and Young Emma. Girls, you know what I'm talking about in this day and age, relationships with girlfriends usually last longer than marriages.

127,grace_fairchild,"Bride Wars, meant to entertain not lead to world peace!",10,10 January 2009,"To the author of the previous comment, I would like to say this: Granted movies like the Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire are awe-inspiring and worthy of ""Oscar-praise"". Bride Wars comes at a time when yes, North America is seeing economic downfall reminiscent of the Great Depression. Does this automatically mean the movie should reflect what current events do? Absolutely not! It is merely here for a comical relief...something that touches the heart and allows viewers to escape if only briefly from their everyday ""REAL life"" struggles. Not every movie has to remind us of how bad times are, and you are quite wrong (spoiler alert!) when you say both leading characters can afford to buy anything they wish. One of the characters is depicted as not being as financially sound as the other, and admittedly has lived off the cast-offs of the other.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so yours is as valid as mine. I urge viewers to go watch this movie. Women, see it because it's not just about ""things"" but also about camaraderie, loyalty and friendship. Men, see it because it's funny and because you will score major brownie points for taking that special woman in your life (and besides, maybe she'll owe you *wink, wink*). At least it's a movie where you will not leave the theater all depressed or having been awoken from a comatose state induced by boredom! I PROMISE!",Bride Wars

This movie is.... terrifying. My friend and I went to this with two other girls, and 1/2 way through the movie, he left, and it was just me and them. This movie was not funny at all. If you have seen the preview, you have seen the movie. They do not do any more 'funny' things to each other than what you see in the preview. The rest is full of bad, bad jokes, and very terrible plot twists, if you can even call it that. Please, do not make any other men see this movie, for the sake of his sanity.

Then the one girl who basically forced her boyfriend to marry her, stayed together and the other bride didn't. It was supposed to be funny but when I was there not one person laughed, the people making this movie tried way to hard, to make it funny. The movie was boring nothing new changed except the pranks and then the brides started to change around their future husbands. The only funny part I would say was when they went to the club and the brides had a dance off. They also in my opinion did a terrible job with the acting.

130,lil-nicks,Bride Wars - fun but exaggerated,6,6 February 2009,"Bride Wars, a movie about two inseparable friends since they were kids who dreamed of having their weddings at the Plaza in June but start a fight to destroy each others wedding when the date is set on the same day. The leading actresses Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway i thought were perfect for the roles they portrayed. Kate did a good job as the neurotic ex-chubby perfectionist competitive personality in contrast to Anne's sweet, people-pleasing, spineless ways. Although there are many exaggerations as in how they try to sabotage the wedding, it portrays an entertaining picture of the reality of how majestic the wedding day should be for some women. I don't agree that men won't like the movie because it unfortunately demonstrates in a humorous way what men already think women are like and make fun of the ""neurotic bride"". The movie is fun. It's fun to see the situation the stars get into. Fun date movie.",Bride Wars

I'm usually very lenient with films and am not picky, but this film, honestly, If I hadn't been there with a friend, I would have got up and left. My expectations weren't even close to being met.The film surrounds two best friends, who, by mistake, have their wedding booked in the same place, same day, and oh my gosh, can you believe it, the same time!!!! Shocking, isn't it? Neither of them want to move their date, so they start fighting. Then, the film takes you through a series of weak attempts to get back at one another. Totally unpredictable, I know. That's basically the entire film, aside from what is supposedly a ""surprising twist"" to finish of the film. The script was empty and there was no chemistry at all. I had virtually no expectations of this film, but I some how came out disappointed. Unless this is the ONLY film left in your video rental store, do not rent or buy it. You'll regret it.",Bride Wars
132,lotuskonoha,Its an enjoyable film that lacks the right chemistry,7,9 May 2009,"bride wars is really not that bad, despite what some of the earlier comments and its unimpressive ratings may have indicated. The plot of the movie may not be the most original, but it was enjoyable. It had likable characters, an elegant setting, not to mention rich background features that made the story as realistic as it can be. The downfall of the movie was the unconvincing chemistry between the two main characters, which is really what the movie is all about. Not to get me wrong, the individual performances by kate hudson and anne hathaway was good, if not great. They did well to bring out each heroine's individual characteristics, but not the bond between them. Throughout the movie, there were many scenes where their friendship seems lacking in substance and the rage among them seemed weak and pathetic. The concluding scene was rather awkward and was sorta hard to watch. the bottomline is that if ur just bored and have nothing else to do, this is a good movie to pass time on.",Bride Wars
133,barrynvanna,"Bridal Chick Flick yes, but it was enjoyable too!",7,20 May 2009,"I just finished watching a DVD rental of Bride Wars and I have to say I was impressed. Given many of the other comments about this movie and especially the negative reactions to the behavior of the two female lead characters towards one another - you would think the film was a lot worse than it actually was. From the trailers it is easy to see this will not be a block buster movie, but rather a funny and touching story about just how crazy the whole wedding phenomenon can become. Underlying the sabotage and pranks, it is still clear these two women care about each other - and many critics overlook that. In my opinion, there is something to be said about the bitter rivalries that can exist between women - whether they be best friends, siblings, or share some other close relationship. Also, if you pay attention to the movie, their love and friendship overcomes the mean spirited pranks. Get over it people, it is just a movie after all, and meant to entertain. That is exactly what it does. The wedding scenes are eye catching, and the movie is worth your time. I hope you will enjoy watching it and sharing in the comedic whirlwind that is wedding planning. And at the very worst, it will help you to appreciate your own nuptials that much more.",Bride Wars
134,n-crosier,Great flick. Fun to watch.,8,7 June 2009,I watched this movie with my daughter last night. I thought it was cute and funny. I don't think it was a waste of tape or money. Maybe those who think it is just don't like chick flicks. I would definitely watch it again. I really enjoyed the music in it as well.I also watched the deleted scenes and they were pretty good. I am surprised they left out the one where the bedazzling took place. I would have like to see how that issue got resolved.I did guess the ending as it is pretty predictable.Candace Bergen does a great job of narrating. I love the part at the end about those who will always stand by you. The use of the still pictures was really good.,Bride Wars
135,EllaBlair104,Something in the middle...,6,21 November 2009,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!! well I had my mind made up for this movie to be just plain horrible, according to the reviews, but since I had no choice but to buy it I did and wasn't REALLY disappointed.I totally agree that the movie isn't really funny as it may seem in the trailer. I mean the fact of making ur rival fat and turning ur friend orange MAY seem funny 'but' they don't crack me up. But there was SOMETHING about it that made me keep watching it.Let me make myself clear, this movie is NOT outstanding in my opinion. There are little things that are really little, but they are very important.Emma (Anne Hathaway)is the quiet and caring, while Liv (Kate Hudson) is aggressive and strong willed. But this experience makes them realize that it's not who the REALLY are. First off Liv has a lot of moral support from her fiancé while Emma doesn't. And at the end of the film we see them as opposites from who they were at the start.It may seem silly but if you watch carefully, you will see what I mean. So if your looking for a good chick flick comedy, maybe this is ideal. But if your just looking for a movie on a rainy day, it isn't that bad.",Bride Wars
136,mariamandhai,underdeveloped and trite,2,11 May 2010,"I thought that the idea of the movie could've been good, in fact done well it could have been a great romantic comedy. BUT It seemed that the director wanted to a do a comedy aimed at a female audience, sans romance, hence neither relationship inspired you to want the couple to get married, Kate Hudson and her beau seemed well suited in the most superficial way, while Anne Hathaway and her beau's conflict was without any layers. It was hard to feel sympathy for either female lead because it seemed that the marriage itself was a mistake so the perfect wedding wasn't going to make it any better. The relationship between Brian Greenberg and Anne Hathaway had the potential of making the movie much better, his character was better developed then either of the grooms, and yet their relationship isn't explored at all in the movie, its hinted at and at the end they are married all of a sudden. All in all the movie was a comedy, without any romance. The comedy wasn't very funny for most of the movie I was embarrassed for either or both of the leads.",Bride Wars
137,cuicui921120,the best,10,1 January 2011,"i don't understand why people say this movie is bad or whatsoever. this movie is the best not only because of the excellent actors but the script as well. like every time after i watched this, i think i learn something more. i learn how important a friend is and a best friend like them is something hard to find in the world nowadays. the kindness inside emma's heart and a superwoman like liv, it is almost everyone's dream. even if we argue with our friends, the best ones will always come back to us and forget every bad thing we've done to them. everything is perfect and believe me you will like it. i am the one who doesn't really have a real friend here, and i really miss my best friend back in my hometown. this movie is a perfect description of friendship. ignore others' comments and watch this movie yourself. there must be people who hate this movie, and if you don't try to watch it, how do you know if you will like it or not? don't judge the movie based on other's comments.",Bride Wars
138,kelseybrinkman5,Comedy without depth,6,8 June 2012,"When I watched this I found it funny, but the way the two ladies act in the film is kind of ridiculous.As we know the women start an all-out duel over a dream wedding.This gives off the unfortunate implication that women would throw away life-long friendships for the ultimate wedding.Even though the message is that friendship is important it doesn't really come off that way for around ninety percent of the movie, because of the horrible things that the two protagonists do to each other.Both women come off as unsympathetic to me, but I suppose others could disagree.At any rate, if you want to watch a movie for some laughs go ahead, don't expect to feel any attachment to the film once it's over.",Bride Wars
139,megan-417-263558,Enjoyable ... but not the best,6,9 July 2012,"I have read a few reviews on this film saying that it's silly, stupid and basically just a waste of time to make. Personally, I don't agree. True, it has it's bad moments, some that are unrealistic, but doesn't every movie have that? I enjoyed it quite a bit, but even I have to say I've seen far better.Two girls, who have been best friends since they were little, are in a battle as they don't want their wedding on the same day. If they're not sharing it (as it's mentioned at one point) then why the fighting? Okay, they each want to have the other at their wedding, but if they're as close friends as everyone thinks, then can't they just think 'Ok, neither of us want to have our wedding in three years' (the other date mentioned). 'Let's just have it separately, and we can reminisce after' (is that the right word)I like it because, in a way, it's realistic and I enjoy films like that. I like the actors cast in it, I like the plot and everything, it's a good film. But only Deb, Emma and Liv have really strong characters, like every film should have, and that gets rid of the shine that this would have if it was better thought out. So Emma's a doormat, Liv's a brat and Deb's a pain in the neck. But once the fight gets rolling, the two friends are just one person set in two bodies. All the men are EXACTLY the same in this, and I can't see anything too weird in the wedding organizer. So, all in all, it's the type of film you'd watch on a rainy day when you're bored with nothing to do. It's only just enjoyable to keep you on your seat until the very end, but it vanishes from you're mind as as soon as it stops. Not the type of film you'd obsess over.",Bride Wars
140,sgirl987,Favourite Movie,10,26 December 2013,"Despite the bad reviews, Bride Wars is my favourite movie ever. I've seen it a million times and I never get tired of it, it's just a funny, entertaining, feel-good movie. I think the bad reviews are just because It is a complete chick flick. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH IT!! Apparently this has to be 10 lines but that's all I have to say so just ignore this: 1111111111111111111111111111111122222222222222222 2222 2222222223 3333333 3333333333 333333344444 4444444444 444444444445555555555 55555555 55556 666 6666 666666 66666 66666 7777 77777777 7777777 777788 8888 888888 888 888888 88999 9 99 999 99 9999 9999999 999999 99999999 999999 99999 999999 9999988 888 88888888 888888 877777 777777 7777777 7777777 77777 7777 77777 77777 7666666 66666666 66666666 66666 6666666 6666 6666666666666655",Bride Wars
141,sabrina050973,Would love to see a pregnancy sequel,10,30 June 2014,"I unlike some other enjoyed the movie. It was comical and I thoroughly liked watching it. My friends all would like to see a pregnancy sequel of Bride Wars. NOT only are the actors exceptional, but just the whole June wedding is enough to have kept me watching. You hear so many people talking about June weddings, but for you and your best friend to have the same wedding date is hilarious how it played out. It is just plain and simply a movie worth watching many times over. I have teenagers who live it, also so it can't be that bad for them to watch. You have to find the lighter side of the plot. It is about a friendship and bonds made since childhood. How people end up still staying together and sharing their special movements in life. That's what it was all about. Although, the one part I didn't like was when at the end something more could've been given such as Pregnancy Wars...",Bride Wars
142,ozgirlw,The previews made this movie look far worse than it is,8,10 January 2009,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, I immediately thought that it would be another horrible chick flick. I really had no desire to see it but my friends did so I went. I was thoroughly surprised when I actually watched it. It was funny, clever, and had some very real moments. Sure, it was a little predictable at times but it was written in a way that I actually didn't mind. The obnoxious scenes in the previews were pretty much the only scenes in the movie that were like that. There was one scene that I didn't care for but it aided the story. The idea of the girls dreaming about their weddings since they were kids is a little stereotypical, but it was very believable in the way that it was shown. In between the cattiness with the blue hair and the orange tan that the previews showed so often, there was a very good movie with sympathetic characters that remind you of your own relationships. I would recommend this movie. It really isn't as obnoxious as the preview might lead you to believe. Also, the scene where the dress is ruined with the colored rhinestones that is shown in the commercial, isn't actually in the movie. I guess they figured that it would have been too much.",Bride Wars
