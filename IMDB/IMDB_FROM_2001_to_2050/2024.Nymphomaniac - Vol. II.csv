0,Leofwine_draca,The lesser of the two films,5,20 June 2016,"Lars von Trier's second film about the life story of a female nymphomaniac goes down increasingly dark alleyways compared to VOL. I, but at the same time I found it the lesser movie. This film just doesn't have the drive or vitality that made the first film so interesting, and there are some odd plot decisions - especially towards the climax - that don't ring true.There are still some oddly gripping moments here, but they're more disturbing than ever. Jamie Bell is a real surprise, playing a completely different character to that than you'd expect and doing very well with it too. I'm surprised that I found Charlotte Gainsbourg less sympathetic than the actress playing the younger version of her character. By the time Willem Dafoe enters the frame, the movie seems to have lost its way and become a bizarre, slow-paced thriller instead. And don't get me started on the Mia Goth stuff.As before, this is a beautifully shot movie with a lot of fragility and artiness contained within its shots. But Lars von Trier can only keep the audience's interest for so long, and by now his tale is beginning to drag, leaving a film that is only so-so rather than profound. And that 'twist' ending is ludicrous more than anything else.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
1,SnoopyStyle,"liked it slightly better than the first, very slight",5,26 January 2015,"Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) continues to tell her story to Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård) and figures out that he's a virgin. The younger Joe (Stacy Martin) has a son Marcel with Jerôme Morris (Shia LaBeouf). She loses sexual feelings. She tries to sleep outside of Jerôme and she even does S&M with K (Jamie Bell). She abandons Jerôme and Marcel. She self-induces an abortion. She tries a support group but blows up at them. She becomes a debt collector. Her boss L (Willem Dafoe) sends her to mentor the 15 year old daughter of a criminal P (Mia Goth). They end in a sexual relationship. She needs to collect from Jerôme (now played by Michaël Pas) and she sends in P to deal with him. She sees that Jerôme and P are together. In the alley, she tries to shoot Jerôme but she fails to fire. Jerôme is the one who beats up Joe in the alley.I like this slightly better than the first part. I do mean very slightly. I like that the movie finally allowed Seligman to question the validity of the story at the end of the first movie. I like that the story gets darker than just a young girl having lots of sex. However I find the movie meanders and lose its way. I rather she stay with Jerôme for the rest of the movie and this be a dysfunctional relationship drama. I also would rather Shia LaBeouf age up to play the older Jerôme. Somewhere between L and P, I lose interest in this movie once again like the first movie. Although it's a bit later this time around.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
2,Horst_In_Translation,Joe is back for more,6,15 September 2014,"I liked the first part of Danish director Lars von Trier's nymphomaniac and I also liked this one although I felt there is a slight decrease in quality. One thing I would criticize is the jump from Stacy Martin (young Joe) to Gainsbourg (grown-up Joe). There's twenty years between the two actresses and even with the good make-up job they did, making the switch with a 3-year-gap is simply not working. One thing I liked was the Antichrist reference. The scene in one of von Trier's older films is nothing short of great and I quite liked the hint given here. Other than, hardly anybody is probably gonna watch this film without having see Nymphomaniac 1, so if you enjoyed the first, you will probably enjoy this one too. The atmosphere and the director's approach does not change too much, although you could probably ask yourself if the duration of both films taken together is justified by the action.About the ending, I wasn't a great fan of it. Von Trier obviously went the showy path and went out with a bang (in the truest sense), but I would have liked the central character just falling asleep more with the end credits rolling in. It just leaves a bitter aftertaste to everything that happened before, all the conversation between the priest and the woman. That's just von Trier though. It wasn't particularly unexpected. Another very controversial scene is the one that involves pedophilia. I won't get into more detail here, but it is certainly one that could be discussed a lot in terms of how Joe's actions were appropriate. Other than that, the film includes lots of debatable actions and characteristics for women: group sex with two black men, the role of women in society, maternal instincts and lack thereof, self-help groups etc.The scene with the two black men I mentioned before was used a lot to advertise this movie and also another scene which includes Willem Dafoe. However, these two are really just very short and minimal and not particularly significant for the whole picture. Nonetheless, it was nice to see Gainsbourg and Dafoe reunite. And even if the burning-down-the-house scene was fairly majestic, the second Nymphomaniac film was missing one real deal-breaker scene that the first one had thanks to Uma Thurman. All in all, I recommend this sequel depending on how you liked the first of von trier's work in general.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
3,claudio_carvalho,Addicted in Sex and Friendship,7,22 March 2014,"Joe continues to tell to Seligman the story of her life. Joe lives with Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf) and their son Marcel and out of the blue, she loses sexual sensation in intercourse, feeling her vagina numb. Joe seeks kinky sex, perversions and sadomasochism expecting to retrieve her sex drive. Jerôme leaves home with Marcel and gives his son to a foster house for adoption. Then Joe is sent to therapy by her gynecologist but she does not admit that she is addicted in sex. Meanwhile Seligman tells to Joe that he is virgin and helps her to understand her actions. Joe believes that Seligman is her friend, but is he?""Nymphomaniac: Vol. II"" is a darker sequel of the volume 1. Joe now is in an adult and her sexual experiences are more perverted and without humor. The conclusion is unexpected and without redemption. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Ninfomaníaca: Volume 2"" (""Nymphomaniac: Volume 2"")",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
4,kosmasp,(Un)happy Endings,8,26 November 2014,"If you have watched the first part (which I hope you did, because this does build on that and demands viewing, not to mention that it is slightly better, no matter how weird that might sound), you know where we left of. Gainsburg character is trying to convince a man that she is bad. What the movie wants to tell us, though it's not trying to hammer that home, is the status of a woman who love intercourse. In stark contrast to what men will be perceived at obviously.Von Trier does this by being as explicit as is possible, though as with part 1 the genitalia is not from the famous actors we have in the movie, but stand-ins. Although the Directors cut is more explicit I presume than the version that was cut for cinema (not having watched that) purposes. But if you get hung up on that, the movie will not be for you. The sex is not for titillating purposes but to prove a point and further the story. Sometimes also for comedic purposes.The ending seems to be capturing everything perfectly ... but then almost completely crushes the whole movie. If you think about it, it kinda still proves the point, but is also kind of simplistic. It could have gone off (no pun intended), with a better result. But maybe that wouldn't have been von Trier then ...",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
5,jboothmillard,Nymphomaniac: Vol. II,8,9 October 2014,"Director Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark, Antichrist) is renowned for doing almost everything for real in his films, I heard about this second in a two-part film during its limited release, and I definitely wasn't going to miss it. Basically it continues from Volume I left off, with Joe (Antichrist's Charlotte Gainsbourg) still recounting her highly erotic life leading to the present day at age fifty, to charming bachelor Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård), starting with a reminiscence of her first orgasm as young woman, Seligman admits being unable to relate to her stories as he is asexual and a virgin, but he assures her he is the right man to listen to them. Joe continues that she fell into crisis when she lost all interest in sex, nothing works as she and Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf) try to work on her problem, they conceive baby Marcel together, Jerôme allows her to have other lovers to satisfy her demand for sex as he struggles to keep up, of course he becomes jealous of her endeavours. The years pass and Joe indulges in sexual encounters with much more fetishism involved, including a botched threesome between African immigrant brothers, and ultimately violent fetishes from sadomasochist K (Jamie Bell), who viscously assaults women in his company, her frequent visits to him eventually take priority over her duties to Marcel. Jerôme keeps an eye on her when their son is unattended one day, to the point when he makes Joe choose between family or K, she picks the latter, it is after a savage beating from K that she resorts to loneliness rather than any possibility of normality, but rather than end this chapter on an unhappy note she talks of the first time K fisted her. Some time passes, a lifetime of sexual activity, combined with K's brutality, has left irreversible damage on Joe, her nymphomania is well known in her new office, her boss therefore demands she attend sex addiction anonymous groups, or face losing her job or in any in the future, she remains in sobriety for three weeks, but seeing her younger self in the mirror she drops out, and even verbally attacks the other group members about their sex addictions, and the Therapist (Kate Ashfield) for her false empathy. Inspired by a tea stain on the wall resembling the Walther PPK her favourite literary character James Bond uses Joe continues her story, she has no place in society, so turns to organised crime, using her sexuality and sadomasochism to extort debtors for a collection agency, her superior is L (Willem Dafoe), and she finds herself an apprentice and successor in P (Mia Goth), who moves in with her, Joe teaches her the tricks of the trade, and they begin a sexual relationship. Joe tells of one debtor she visits, the Gentleman (Jean-Marc Barr) is in a chair with his trousers opened and his penis exposed, she attempts to give him an erection describing various sexual fantasies, she is near giving up until she mentions children, he exposes him as a paedophile as he gets an erection as she describes a child being with him, feeling shamed and guilty he agrees to pay his debt, and while sobbing Joe gives him a blowjob, she admits to Seligman feeling pity for the man for destroying his life, and doing this was like a means of apology. On another occasion of debt collecting Joe recognises the house of a now older Jerôme (Michael Pas), so she is not seen she send P to perform her first solo job, Joe spots her cheating on her with him, she fails in attempt to leave town, so she waits for Jerôme and P in a near alleyway for them to come out, she points a gun she confiscated at them, but she forgot to rack the pistol chamber before pulling the chamber, Jerôme visciously beats Joe, then penetrates P in front of her, P urinates on her body before they leave her, in the state that Seligman found her. In the present Seligman suggests how circumstances in her life lead her to her actions, he also states that subconsciously she did not want to kill Jerôme, therefore forgetting to rack an automatic pistol, finally Joe says she is tired and wants to sleep, but as she drifts off Seligman comes into her bed with his pants down and attempts to have sexual intercourse, it cuts to black as Joe reaches for and racks the gun, he protests his actions, but there is a gunshot, and it ends as you hear her collect her things and leave. Also starring Stacy Martin as Young Joe, Christian Slater as Joe's Father, Sophie Kennedy Clark as B and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective's Udo Kier as The Waiter. Gainsbourg as the self-loathing sex addict is compelling as she descends into humiliation and narrates her depressing story, Skarsgård as the bookish single man playfully interrupts with his psychoanalytical interpretations, Bell proves he has grown dramatically since Billy Elliot playing the chilling and sinister sadomasochist, and supporting members Martin, Dafoe, Slater and Goth do well in their scenes also. The film is notorious for its real sex, using pornographic actors to double for the modest stars, while they act sexual scenes, and even use prosthetic genitals for close ups, the best moment of this one is the paedophile arousal exposure, but it is not just all about the sexual escapades, it is promiscuous tale of self discovery, it may not be to everyone's taste, but personally I found it a most interesting provocative arty drama film, not to be missed. Very good!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
6,BA_Harrison,M()re b()ring pseud()-intellectual p()rn from Lars V()n Trier.,1,19 November 2017,"Nymph()maniac Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) continues to tell her soporific tale of sex addiction and S&M to asexual stranger Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård).I surely deserve some kind of medal for watching Nymph()maniac Volumes 1 and 2 back-to-back; either that or I need my head examining. Like the first film, this second volume is wall-to-wall pseudo-intellectual tripe with a little hardcore sex and some S&M to spice things up. Actually, scrap that it's more like a hardcore sex and S&M movie with some pseudo-intellectual claptrap in an effort to validate it as a work of art and not just extremely bad porn.It's hard to say who or what I hated most about this film, since virtually every frame irked me, but if I had to choose it would be both Skarsgård and Gainsbourg, whose lifeless performances threaten to put the viewer into a coma, Jamie Bell's irritating turn as professional masochist K (I have hated almost everything I have seen him in) and Shia La Beouf as Jerome (I've hated almost everything I have seen him in too).Having now sat through three Lars Von Trier movies, the other being the barely watchable Antichrist, I can now say that I am officially done with this director.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
7,Quinoa1984,More Nymphomaniac...,7,28 April 2014,"This was one of those rare times when somehow, someway, a storyteller screwed up so bad in the last minute of his four hour epic that it left a sour taste in my mouth - like, Stephen King's It territory here. I won't say what von Trier does, but believe me you will almost regret having watched the rest of the film. Or if you are already not into it, you'll want to bash your head against the wall for being so stupid. That's how incredulous this is - one last middle finger to the audience. A shame then as up until that one minute, this was growing on me (pun intended) even more than the first one, with Gainsbourg here more-so in the flashback chapters this time as it shows her older, more confused and disillusioned with her sexuality to the point of being a whipping post for Jamie Bell (aka Tintin (!)) You don't watch either of these films to get turned on; on the contrary, the entire enterprise would be a rigorous intellectual pursuit of sexuality if not for how equally rigorous von Trier writes his (Anti)heroine and how emotionally empty-and-then-full-and-sorrowful Gaisnbourg plays her.It's a performance that seems low-key at times, just by how softly she speaks and cold she acts around people, but that is really a testament to how much she digs into this disturbed, lonely person, and wants us to feel something, anything, and we do, a lot of things. (As an aside, another annoying thing - doing a call-back to the opening of Antichrist. Come on, Lars, how many times are you gonna have that in your movies? At least this time it wasn't at 2000 fps but still! sorry, spoiler-ish digression).So, ultimately a worthwhile experience, these two films, and taken as a whole I was amused, bemused, shocked (genuinely, including a particular scene where dirty talk about little boys in a playground to a nasty criminal is a scene that shook me to the core and was a true, unqualified provocation), wrapped up in the drama like it was an (anti)soap, and though the ending and a couple of other things got my goad, I hand it to the Dane he has once again succeeded in making a film that is like a ""rock in my shoe"" as he puts it about his oeuvre.And one more note - Shia LaBeouf. I mentioned in a review of part 1 how I thought he was surprisingly good. In part 2 he's even better; sympathetic, emotionally available at every beat, like a sad puppy as opposed to the simple ass of the first volume (of course this isn't ALL that's to be seen, but then I'd be spoiling more than I'd care to, and isn't the same actor at this point anyway). Among a cast that includes the likes of Willem Dafoe and Stellan Sarsgaard, he more than holds his own. He may not be ""famous"" anymore, but as long as he can put himself in the hands of directors who know how to actually use him, I say go for it.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
8,CinemaSerf,Not in the same league at the first film...,5,29 June 2020,"Picking up from the first outing for our sex-addict ""Joe"" (Charlotte Gainsbourg) we continue with her recounting of her life to Stellan Skarsgårdas as her life becomes slightly more settled; she lives with ""Jerome"" (Shia LeBeouf) and has a child. That, however, serves as a temporary, slight, distraction from her insatiable desire to push her body to the limits of sexual, and now physical endurance. Finding that she no longer feels satisfied by any form of sexual encounter, she turns to more masochistic endeavours and this, to be fair - especially the scenes with Jamie Bell - are tough to watch. Indeed, this film shows us more of the controlling aspects of ""Joe"" as she no longer reacts to her nature, but now appears to be capable more of nurturing her desires. That robs this sequel of the honesty and integrity of the first film; she is now much more in control of her choices and therefore susceptible to criticism - and her choices are reactionary, short sighted and just plain stupid. By the last half hour she has lost any interest and/or sympathy I ever had and what started out as quite a fascinating look at female sexuality desire and obsession at it's most raw becomes a sort of poor pseudo-psychology exercise.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
9,grantss,"Despite the controversy, quite dull and pointless.",3,30 December 2014,"Despite the controversy, quite dull and pointless.A movie that relies largely on the shock value of its subject matter and of some of its scenes. Take these away and it is largely empty.There are some interesting themes that appear - fidelity (and infidelity), addiction, control - but these are just touched upon. In the end it is the usual Lars von Trier exercise in pretentious navel-gazing. Even the erotic scenes are hardly erotic, seeming just ho-hum and a chore.Performances are like the characters: dull. Charlotte Gainsburg only does pretentious roles (which explains why she tends to appear in von Trier movies) and this is no exception. Stellan Sarsgaard is particularly boring. Shia Lebeouf seems out of his depth in a serious movie. His accent is particularly appalling and laughable, ending up somewhere between English, South African and Australian.About the only performance that I found riveting was that of Uma Thurman, but unfortunately her screen time is very limited.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
10,namashi_1,"A Disturbing, Sexual Tour-De-Force!",7,2 May 2014,"The continuation of Nymphomaniac: Vol. I, 'Nymphomaniac: Vol. II' is A Disturbing, Sexual Tour-De-Force! Writer-Director Lars von Trier succeeds enormously by creating a world of continuous repulsion & guilt, while the performances range from extra-ordinary to good. 'Nymphomaniac: Vol. II' is The continuation of Joe's sexually dictated life delves into the darker aspects of her adulthood, obsessions and what led to her being in Seligman's care.'Nymphomaniac: Vol. II' culminates its troubled protagonist's long-drawn journey with a sense of paranoia & unpredictability. Lars von Trier's Screenplay, divided in two volumes respectively, delivers a story of complete bleakness, repulsion & lust. He successfully transports you into this world of wildness & greed. His Direction, on the other-hand, is extremely well-handled. Cinematography & Editing are mention-worthy.Performance-Wise: Charlotte Gainsbourg as Joe, is astonishing. The actress nails the part & delivers a subtly devastated performance. Stellan Skarsgård is another topper. He's excellent. Jamie Bell, in a very menacing part, is despicable. Willem Dafoe does his bit well, as always. Mia Goth is first-rate. Shia LaBeouf & Stacy Martin, who lead volume 1, appear in cameos this time.

11,lasttimeisaw,"Nymphomaniac: Vol. I & II, an ironic smack to the hypocrisies.",8,17 June 2014,"A 4-hour binge watching of provocateur Lars von Trier's latest feminist saga (divided into two volumes) is a candid confession of a middle-age nymphomaniac Joe (Gainsbourg, doughtily consummates her enthralling rendering in von Trier's Trilogy of Depression, after ANTICHRIST 2009 and MELANCHOLIA 2011, 8/10), out of self-hatred, she chronicles her deviant life from childhood to present, to an elder Jewish polymath Seligman (Skarsgård), who brings her home after finding her lying on the street afflicted from a savage assault. Dividing the narrative by eight chapters (five of which is named after things Joe spots at the stark room they are staying, and the rest three are Jerôme, Ms. H and Delirium) , Joe and Seligman set about a chamber conversation where Joe relates her sexual experiences and personal battle of being a nymphomaniac while Seligman pleasingly proffers some metonymical digressions eruditely drifting from fly-fishing, classical music (Bach's cantos firmus and Beethoven's fugue), religions (Eastern church's bliss-provoking icon to Catholic church's weight on suffering, meanwhile Seligman is a non-believer and an anti-Zionist), and paraphrasing Joe's comment, the dullest one is about the Prusik knot. The vigorous and informative two-hander plays off intermittently between the flashbacks of Joe's exploration of her sexuality, in the volume one, a young Joe (splendidly portrayed by the débutante Stacy Martin) commits herself in promiscuity to kick against the stale notion of ""love"" with her bestie B (Sophie Kennedy Clark, an exceptional veer from the young Philomena Lee in PHILOMENA 2013, 9/10), winning a sex contest on the train by performing a fellatio to a passenger who is en route to impregnate his wife, being a disinclined home wrecker of H's family (a welcoming Uma Thurman reverting in the groove as Ms. H, with three young sons tailing along to face off with the other woman). At the end of the day, Joe falls for her virginity-snatcher Jerôme (LaBeouf), as love Is the secret ingredient of sex, when her life is back on a normal track, incomprehensibly and precipitately, she lost all her sexual desire. This is the coda of Vol. I. In Vol. II, Joe plunges into the imperative venture to regain her sexuality, she bears a boy with Jerôme and opts for C-section hoping to rehabilitate her vagina, engages in interracial threesome, finally, gives in to the sadomasochistic therapy with K (Jamie Bell, a trans-formative endeavor as the young domineering sadist) at the expense of her relationship with Jerôme and her child. Segueing into the next paragraph, the film veers into a masculine aggression facet of Joe's character revelation (almost she is always the one who initiates in all kinds of sex activities), now she actually utilizes her experience and knowledge to succeed in the niche as a debt collector, and eventually develops a lesbian liaison with her young disciple P (Mia Goth), then the movie descends into a dire quandary when P cheats on her with Jerôme (Michael Pas substitutes for LaBeouf here, although non-simultaneous cast-alteration is quite perplexing) and after a futile assassination, Joe is whipsawed by the betrayal of P (with the taste of her urine) and a ruthless reenactment of her humiliation with the 3+5 Fibonacci sequence numbers about her virginity.That's the story before Seligman found her on the street, throughout the film, von Trier deploys intricate cinematic tricks to unflinchingly titillate viewers' perception about how to deal with or accept our innate lust with diverting enlightenment, like the opening audio-only 3-minute prepares us for a journey chockablock with vicariously sensational feelings, a graphic exhibition of genitals, PPT-alike slides interposed laboriously to clarify the cerebral notions pointed by Seligman, not to mention the symbolic soul-searching process through wintry trees for Joe through the influence of her late father (Slater).Ultimately, the film reaches its climactic conclusion, Seligman is a self-claimed virgin, an asexual man predominantly basks in books, in other words, the perfect antithesis of Joe, the final humanistic touch of von Trier is to shuck off the theoretical benevolence and shatter the veneer to uncloak the intrinsic hypocrisy with an in-your-face smack, libido overrides sensibilities most of the time, fashionably-coined terminology doesn't define who you are, we falls into von Trier's cynical subterfuge involuntarily, nevertheless, it is upbeat and gratifying in the realm of my own POV.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
12,KineticSeoul,It gets worse,3,24 May 2014,"Lars is one of those directors that is emphasis the freedom of speech and tries to be controversial. However sometimes, there is a limit to that. And I am not one of the viewers that nitpick or makes a big deal out of this in movies. But this one really pushes the limit with it's messages about how pedophiles deserve a medal for not giving into the desires with action. Seriously what the crap man? I feel the second part was just not really necessary and really could have combined it into a 3 or so hour movie. This is the spiraling downward story of Joe and it really drags a lot. I am not sure if the main goal for Lars was to bore and make the audiences depressed a great deal through this volume, but if so it does the trick. The dialogue this time around is also really boring and lost it's somewhat interesting flare that the first volume has. The message seems to be that there is no hope, people are all selfish hypocrites even the ones trying to do the right things, there is not point in caring for others because people are crap. And that is what this movie seems to come down to. I am cool with people being entitled to their own opinions although I may disagree. But this Vol is all about shock factor, but it just got boring and annoying really quickly and just wanted it all to end. Even if it has a crappy ending. Now when it comes to the ending of this movie, some critics seem to feel that it's a betrayal and a middle finger to the audiences. I actually re-watched certain scenes to see if there is any symbol or messages that I might have missed that leads to the ending. And not really, the ending really is a cop out. It's like Lars was inspired by movies like ""Irreversible"" or ""Man Bites Dog"" and was like Lars was thinking ""I can't let this movie have a somewhat happy ending, it needs to end with a tragedy. Even if that tragedy is just smacked on there because I am all about melancholia"". Maybe he just wanted to shock the audiences one last time, like you know it's coming but giving hope to the audiences and then crushing it. Some say Seligman was trying to sacrifice himself others say it's to show the unavoidable power of sexual desire and hypocrisy as the human condition. Knowing a bit about Lars, it would have to be the latter.3/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
13,Hellmant,I'm sure both installments will stay with me (and haunt me) forever.,8,31 March 2014,"'NYMPHOMANIAC: VOL. II': Four Stars (Out of Five)The second half of writer/director Lars von Trier's two-part Danish film (which is available in a shorter softer version and an extended more explicit cut; like the first half is). It was also released in it's entirety (with the first half) as a 5 and a half hour long movie in Denmark (at the end of last year). It's notorious for containing lots of explicit sex scenes with pornographic actors genitals superimposed over the movie stars (playing the roles in the film). Just like the first half I didn't enjoy this installment much (it's way too dark and disturbing for me) but I did admire it's originality and artistic boldness.It stars Charlotte Gainsbourg as a 50-year-old nymphomaniac, named Joe, who tells her life story (as a sex addict) to a man who comes to her aid after she's been beaten (played by Stellan Skarsgård). Stacy Martin plays the part when she's much younger (in flashbacks). The story picks up (in this part) with young Joe losing all sexual feeling, randomly, during intercourse with Jerome (played by Shia LaBeouf). Her sexual journey then takes an even darker and more twisted turn. The film also co-stars Jamie Bell, Willem Dafoe, Mia Goth, Christian Slater and many others.While I gave this half (of the two-part film) the same rating as the first I did like the prior installment more. It was lighter and funnier and this half gets a lot more twisted and dark (which is saying a lot, given the first part is pretty dark and twisted itself). In a lot of ways I hated this movie; it makes me feel really disgusted and depressed and like I needed to take about twelve showers after I finished watching it, but that's what films like this are supposed to do. I think von Trier really accomplished what he set out to do with both movies and while it is weird seeing a male writer/director try to explain a woman's sex life to us I still think he did an amazing job. While I hate the way films like this make me feel I still admire them and while I don't think either movie is a masterpiece they are still both really well made and memorable films. I'll never ever forget them; there are scenes in both installments that I'm sure will stay with me (and haunt me) forever.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf1t0-xhgYs",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

15,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,5,9 July 2014,"Nymphomaniac: Volume II The best part of being a nymphomaniac is you don't need to own many clothes.Surprisingly, the sex-fiend in this drama has a respectable wardrobe.Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) continues her sexual confession for Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård), the impartial passerby who found her beaten in an alleyway.From her failures as a wife and mother that lead her to weekly sessions with a sadomasochist (Jamie Bell), to her relationship with her father (Christian Slater) which now influences her relationship with her protégée (Mia Goth), Joe bares her soul to the stranger.Drawing ever closer to the reason she was left half-alive in the gutter.The final chapter of Lars von Trier's magnum opus, Volume II fills in a lot of the holes from the first volume but also tends to venture into some unlikely scenarios involving a criminal (Willem Dafoe).Ironically, this film's target audience will be having sex throughout it.

16,atlasmb,Some Great Acting Drives This Mediocre Vehicle,5,16 September 2015,"I watched both ""Volume I"" and ""Volume II"" in the Director's Cut and I am reviewing both here, as the director considered these as one work.How could a film with such wonderful acting achieve such mediocre results? I asked myself that question afterwards.The entirety, which is a series of chapters, is very uneven. Some chapters/stories were entertaining, some were annoying, and some felt irrelevant. The film recounts the psychosexual history of a damaged woman, from her early childhood to present day. One might look for reasons, causes for her behavior, her neuroses. But for the most part, they just are. One might look for a moral, and a case can be made for the story being a series of morals, but they do not add up to a compelling whole. And one might look for a life view to make itself known. But the main character, Joe, only offers her view that she has the right to be as screwed up as she wants to be. That is true, but it is not enlightening.After all the tales are told, the director lets us know that Joe--though she might disagree--is not responsible for her actions. Men are (cause). And men are responsible for all of the world's ills (moral). And we should all go through life with these beliefs (world view). It's a nifty trick of an ending, but it could be tacked onto the end of any film or any life. It is not a revelation, it is bias parading as truth and it is quite a letdown. Mostly it is lazy writing and a disappointment. If someone else were to posit (at the end of the film) that it all proves that man needs religion, it would be just as senseless.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
17,Bored_Dragon,"""The human qualities can be expressed in one word: hypocrisy.""",10,26 January 2019,"In the second film, Charlotte Gainsbourg takes on the lead role from Stacy Martin. These two actresses, both in appearance and in spirit, are so different that it was impossible for me to see them as the same person, which completely breaks down the continuity of the story. I literally had the impression that I was watching another film, about another woman, on a similar topic. And in addition, the protagonist of the first film, despite everything, was quite likable, while I felt repulsive and disgusted towards a disturbed masochist from the second part. Trier returns to his recognizable style of shooting scenes with the sole purpose of upsetting your stomach. No one will convince me that an explicit and extremely detailed view of a woman who performs an abortion on herself in any way contributes to a better understanding of the story or a stronger dramatic effect. It's simply there to shock you, upset you and maybe even make some of you give up on further watching. Controversy for controversy sake, which, in my opinion, is a feature of the egomaniac who must at all costs be at the center of attention. The story becomes more morbid, crueler and much darker, and technically too stretched, less convincing and more boring. Seligman's digressions got weaker and the overall impression was that actors too share my experience of the film and that they are already bored, and now they are only getting to the end.Although it is single five-hour film, subjectively I experienced it as two films, of which the first is a masterpiece of drama, while the second is a weaker sequel that vainly tries to mimic the greatness of the first one. And yet, when my impressions settled, all the flaws of the film can not diminish their strength. If I ignore the parts inserted just for the sake of shock and controversy, what remains is one of the most powerful dramas I've ever seen in my life, and to which I simply can not give anything less than the highest rating.Seligman: ""You shouldn't use that word. It's not what you call politically correct.""
Joe: ""Well, excuse me, but in my circles, it's always been a mark of honor to call a spade a spade. Each time a word becomes prohibited, you remove a stone from the democratic foundation. Society demonstrates its impotence in the face of a concrete problem by removing words from the language. The book burners have nothing on modern society.""
Seligman: ""I think society would claim that political correctness is a very precise expression of democratic concern for minorities.""
Joe: ""And I say that society is as cowardly as the people in it, who, in my opinion, are also too stupid for democracy.""
Seligman: ""I understand your point, but I totally disagree. I have no doubt in the human qualities.""
Joe: ""The human qualities can be expressed in one word: hypocrisy. We elevate those who say right but mean wrong and mock those who say wrong but mean right.""10/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
18,Reno-Rangan,The second phase of transformation of middle aged Joe,7,7 May 2014,"As the story follows from the volume 1 my review too not much difference because to me, I watched these two parts as a narrow single story. I does liked it for many reasons and one of it was the soundtracks, so awesome. This installment was only slightly different in form of a story. It demonstrates the transformation of the character Joe, from what we had known her in the first.This movie with two volumes were the final movie of Lars Von Trier's 'depression' trilogy after 'Antichrist' and 'Melacholia'. An astonishing performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg in all the three movie. In fact Von Trier used her perfectly according to the script demanded. All these three movies will be her career best. In some of the scenes I could not believe it and said 'was she did it?'. Yes of course, but filmmakers has a different theory and says they used a body double in sensitive portion of the scenes with the little help of computer magic.It is an inappropriate movie for the few though well made movie if you consider it is a reality for those who are affected by nymphomania. The movie is available in two versions, explicit and softer edition. So I recommend the people are eager to watch this choose according to your need.I have already said almost everything in the volume 1 review that is why volume 2 review looks kind of pale. So you can go through that if you have not read yet. #Nymphomaniac: Volume 1 Review. Overall, this duology was one of the best among similar themes, especially who love adult movie with a clean merge of reasonable drama.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
19,Dr_Coulardeau,The end is totally disappointing,7,23 August 2015,"That's a monumental film with four hours of moving pictures that end in one single sequence that alas changes the whole meaning of these four hours. But let's keep that last sequence for the end.The film has a subject that is irritatingly made sibylline by the parentheses in the place of the O in the title. These parentheses could mean many things but they always have to mean that something is in- between them, and in a title it can only be the person this title indicates, hence Joe. She is thus asserted to be in-between two things and though we do not understand what she is in-between when looking at the title, we very fast understand many possible meanings.Right at the beginning of the story, a story that is being told to us by the voice over of Joe herself and the voice over of Seligman, her benefactor, savior and listener, she tells us about a vision she had when twelve or so with two women appearing in the sky, one being seen more or less like the Holy Virgin by Joe herself. But Seligman at once introduces another interpretation. One is Valeria Messalina, Emperor Claudius's wife, and the second is the Whore of Babylon. The first one is a woman with a very dubious reputation though that reputation is probably more the result of political strife than of real facts. ""She was a paternal cousin of the Emperor Nero, a second-cousin of the Emperor Caligula, and a great-grandniece of the Emperor Augustus. A powerful and influential woman with a reputation for promiscuity, she allegedly conspired against her husband and was executed on the discovery of the plot."" (Wikipedia) The Whore of Babylon everyone knows since she is the great monstrous promiscuous by profession heroin of Saint John's Apocalypse, or Book of Revelation. It is strange a girl of twelve could have a vision of these two women though she has no religious education and she does not recognize them, hence she does not know them. That's the type of detail that shows that Lars von Trier is manipulating us because he wants to introduce Seligman as someone who knows about this all because as we are told he is a Jew and he tells us his name means ""the blessed man"" in German or Yiddish. He even clearly says he is an anti-Zionist and he declares that anti-Zionism does not mean anti-Semitism though many people think the opposite. . . . And then we come to the end and what Joe says then is essential:""Even if only one in a million succeeds in mentally, bodily and in her heart of ridding herself of her sexuality, this is now my goal."" (Seligman: ""Is that a life worth living?"") ""It's the only way I can live. I will stand up against all odds. Just like a deformed tree on a hill. I will muster all my stubbornness, my strength, my masculine aggression. But most of all I want to say thanks to my new and maybe first friend. Thank you, Seligman, who perhaps is happy when all is said and done. I'm happy at any rate that the shot didn't go off and made me a murderer. If I may, I'd like to sleep now.""We are surprised by the ""masculine aggression"" in this discourse because she never showed any masculinity at all. Her aggressiveness was always feminine sexuality and submission to masculine violence, willingly in her masochistic-sadistic period and unwillingly in her last encounter with Jerome. The script here does not correspond to the film we have seen, because that script would imply her lovers were nothing but clandestine homosexuals.But the film that could stop there with Seligman getting out, Joe turning of the light and going to sleep, does not reach its end then. A final sequence is added with Seligman, in his shirt coming back into the room and trying to take advantage of sleeping Joe. We understand Joe refuses, we hear Seligman arguing she has done it with a lot of men, as if that argument gave him the right to take what he suddenly wanted after having explained that he was a virgin, that he had never had a woman, not a man as for that. We hear a shot in the total darkness on the screen, pants being zipped up and then feminine shoe steps going away. She became a murderer after all.But that was inescapable after the four hours of Freudian rationalizing about Joe. The shocking element in this last sequence is that the one who tries to take Joe without her consent, the one who has no moral ethics at all in such a situation where Joe had enshrined in him her total trust is also a Jew. This ending implies that Jews do not ask before taking, and Jews are perverts and a few other things. That last sequence is absolutely and inescapably anti-Semite. Why did Lars von Trier inject that last touch of unacceptable ideology in a film that had been too long for one and too intellectual for two, but it had remained free of sexism, racism and anti-Semitism. Unluckily the last sequence changes that last fact and this is not acceptable, just the same as the sexism implied by a man taking a woman without her consent. Does it reveal the film is anti-Semite? Definitely yes. Does it say anything about the author and director? Certainly not. Then what is the director's motivation in that last touch of anti-Semitism? He is the only one who can answer this question but it is definitely out of place in this film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
20,filipemanuelneto,A mediocre end to a movie that had not started very well.,1,7 December 2017,"Contrary, perhaps, to the majority of the public, I decided to see this film because of the name of its director, Lars von Trier. If I liked ""Antichrist"" and I considered this film particularly artistic, I do not know yet very well what to think about this film, which is the second half of a movie that, in fact, has already started quite badly, with a Vol. I weaker than I expected. The script continues the conversation between Joe and his good Samaritan, the innocent and asexual Seligman. The story gradually becomes more dense, with the protagonist descending deeper into her own perversion: sadomasochism, beatings, the destruction of her own family with dramatic consequences for her only child, the way of crime... all seems to reveal the worst consequences of sex addiction. However, as it all grows darker, the film loses verisimilitude and becomes an unbelievable sexual tale.The film is absolutely loaded with explicit sex scenes, with close shots of the genitals and penetration. Von Trier remains faithful to the rule of showing everything that is spoken, whether it be beautiful or ugly. So this movie requires you to be, at least, able not to be scandalized by the sex scenes. If you cannot, the best thing to do is watch another movie. On the other hand, sex scenes are so cruel and insensitive that you probably will not take any pleasure in watching it. Emotionally violent, the film raises constant moral and ethical issues.About the actors, I mentioned in my review of Vol. 1 that I did not like the performance of Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgård. I like the way the characters seem to complete themselves, for they are totally the opposite of each other: the sinner and the saint. But I don't like their cold way, and the ultra-intellectual and insipid dialogues annoy me a bit, almost as much as obscenities. Jamie Bell was well but his character seems incomprehensible. I'll never realize why he did that to women. Willem Dafoe seems too nice to be a real criminal and Mia Goth has received a ridiculous character. In fact, the whole final part of the movie is ridiculous and it was what I most hated here.This movie is a bad ending to a story that has never had great merits from the beginning, but that is sinking in the mud as it walks towards the end. As for the sex scenes, they are absolutely pointless, as happens throughout the entire movie. The story could have been perfectly told the same way without having to see all the details. And there's still that famous abortion scene! Absolutely horrible to watch, but very educational for anyone who says they agree with this practice for some obtuse reason.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
21,leonblackwood,Not as good as the first volume. 5/10,5,15 November 2014,"Review: I wasn't that impressed with the second volume of this intriguing story of a nymphomaniac. The story went down some weird avenues which spoilt the original storyline. After becoming a mother, she still cannot seem to have an orgasm, so she starts to go to these classes were she gets whipped and tied up. STRANGE! Then the storyline takes a complete different turn were she becomes a successful debt collector and takes on a successor who completely turns on her. There are also some unnecessary scenes, like when the Africans are arguing with erections and I was really disappointed with the ending. After watching 4 hours of this woman life story, I really was expecting more about her different conquests, but she just became more twisted in her mind, the older that she got. Anyway, the second volume wasn't exactly what I hoped for, but it's obvious that the story hasn't ended because the director cleverly left it wide open at the end. Watchable!Round-Up: Willem Dafoe always puts in good performances in his movies, but his character wasn't a good addition to this storyline. He seemed to ask for weird things from the main character which didn't seem to have anything to do with the original concept. I'm glad that the director showed how Joe ended up in the alleyway, but I didn't understand why her successor turned on her. I also missed the brilliant performances from the top actors in the first volume and she seemed to have forgotten about her son without mentioning him throughout the rest of the movie. Anyway, I honestly think that the second volume was very sketchy, but the overall concept is worth a watch.Budget: $4.7million Worldwide Gross: $4.9millionI recommend this movie to people who were into the first instalment of this movie and who want to see how the main characters life story progresses. 5/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
22,videorama-759-859391,Nymphing up better,9,4 January 2015,"Okay, now we really get to the crux of the movie. I felt it straight from the beginning of this. This one just seems to hold more weight, than the prior one which was very tasty and peppered with a lot of sex and nudity, that I totally approve of, where there was some smart humor as well. I'll be honest though. I did enjoy 1 more than 2. This last half of film just holds more clout. We see much less of Joe, one intimate restaurant scene, involving a lot of silverware, snatched from an abundance of it, and stuck not in the best of places, a hoot. Joe, still not cured, now craves pain, goes to an S and M therapist guy (Jamie Bell) who shines, out from the rest of the performers, who gives hardcore whipping and punching sessions, brutal therapy you might say, as if to may'be turn her off sex, I wasn't sure. The black two on one orgy scene that never happened is uproarishly funny, where these two well hung guys, momentarily command the screen with their erect johnsons. Volume 2 becomes very dark, especially near it's end, where in the after, we arrive at the start again. This dark, fascinating territory of story has Joe trying to divert her attention off her sexual yearnings, by becoming part of a group who rob people, who pay to be robbed, where Joe gives the clients, who happen to be pedos, rough sexual treatment. I was grateful to finally see Willem Dafoe, who I'd be awaiting, simply known as L, a recluse and therapist, who could be the last resort for Joe. What I actually found annoying, if kind of putting a bummer on it, was the Shia Le Beouf scene, where they actually used Gainsborough, which to me didn't make sense. They could of had the younger lass, made older. The ending, I never saw coming, where I must say after viewing this whole 4 hour affair, I found this film, highly engrossing, with perfect evenness as we flash back and forth intermittently to Stellarsgard and Gainsborough. What I couldn't get over is, you hardly see Gainsborough smile, where Martin as her younger self, is almost smiling constantly. I loved the acting in this film, (performance level is high) but in this edition, it was Bell (Yeah, Billy Elliott) who truly stuck out. God knows why they played a teaser to Volume 2 in the end credits to Volume One, the cool mid air floating shots of Stellarsgard and a totally naked Martin, sticking out in my mind, in this sequence, played to a shattering rock score. I must say, the start of Volume Two, kicks off beautifully with the angelic scene of a young child Joe, rising as if in a remake of The Exorcist. Beautifully memorable. We also have a flashback, Anti Christ moment which gladly didn't follow through.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
23,strong-122-478885,Hey! Like - Hello!!?? All That Fuss Over This!!??,1,5 November 2017,"Ho-hum!... Well - Here we go again!.... Nymphomaniac, like ""Shame"" and ""Looking For Mister Goodbar"", is yet another sordid, unsavoury, and totally sneering look at the consequences that are apparently supposed to result from excessive promiscuity.When it comes to sheer heavy-handedness - This shamelessly preachy, little picture self-righteously tells the viewer that having lots of sex with many partners is a hateful thing (so don't you dare love it).This is the sort of movie that neither stimulates the mind nor arouses the libido. Nope. It absolutely numbs both. If you are expecting Nymphomaniac to live up to its title as being an intensely pleasant and wildly erotic experience, you are definitely in for a major disappointment.Incompetently directed by Lars Von Trier (who must be an utterly despicable prig) - Nymphomaniac amounted to being nothing but a dreary, little soap opera (with lots of graphic sex thrown in for good measure) that took 4 frickin' hours to get its shallow, sex-hating point across..... Sheesh! Like - Hey! Give me a break, already!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
24,parry_na,Spoilers for parts 1 and 2 ...,9,9 February 2018,"'Nymphomaniac' is a huge project written and directed by Lars von Trier. Trier has proven a controversial figure over the years, with his filmic output attracting similar contention and many awards (Shia LaBeouf, who stars as Jerome, has said about von Trier that he is 'dangerous. He scares me. And I'm only going to work now when I'm terrified.'). Trier suffers from depression, and appears to inject some of his personality into the characters. This is my first experience of his work, and I absolutely love it.A beautifully directed opening, simply featuring snow falling on an industrial landscape, water dripping from roofing, slowly reveals the beaten and broken figure of a young woman Joe. She is found by lonesome scholar, bachelor Seligman, whose quiet ways mask his erudite intelligence. When Joe stirs, she too, is very well spoken, very refined. After she refuses medical treatment, he takes her to his spacious but dilapidated home. Therein, with the falling snow outside acting as a constant backdrop, she tells him about herself. She is a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac, and despises herself for it. Using his own interests as a yardstick, Seligman interprets her self-loathing, often into something more positive. Joe's stories are divided into various chapters, sometimes resulting in her destroying lives and relationships, sometimes not. Seligman's precise and dispassionate synopsis is because he is a virgin and remains sexually unmoved by Joe's forthright, graphic accounts.Possibly the most disturbing chapter is 6. ""The Eastern and the Western Church (The Silent Duck)"", in which Joe visits 'K' (Jamie Bell) to assuage her never-ending sexual dependency. The violence inflicted upon her willing person is punishing and sadistic - and it comes at a heavy price: the loss of Joel and son Marcel. Here we are actually seeing the regular repercussions and personal consequences of her condition and it is horrific.'Nymphomaniac' is fascinating throughout. The playing is exemplary, the direction beautifully contrasting the ramshackle calm of Seligman's existence, and the unstoppable, often self-destructive calamity of Joe's addiction to sex. Sometimes the scenes are extremely graphic for a brief time, but such is the surrounding story and reasons for her carnal addiction, they convey the nature of her being rather than shock. There is a poetic sense of symmetry to certain events, words and statistics that ensures many things come full circle. And ultimately, that the flaws of the characters dovetail each other in a very satisfying manner.The cast list contains Charlotte Gainsburg and Stacey Martin as Joe at different ages, Stellan Skarsgård as Seligman, and features Christian Slater, Uma Thurman, William Defoe and Udo Kier amongst many other very talented, naturalistic actors. The excellent Mia Goth plays 'P' (Goth is starring in a forthcoming remake of 'Suspiria' in 2018). My only complaint would be that the actors playing young versions of the characters look unlike the older versions - that is, if everything else wasn't so perfect. And perfect isn't a word I have cause to use very often.'Nymphomaniac' was released in two parts in the UK, but has a total running time of either 241 minutes or 325 minutes, depending on whether you see the uncut version or not. It has deservedly won multiple awards, including three for Trier himself. Devoting the time to watch is an undertaking, but is worth it, because your eyes will never dare to leave the screen.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
25,sauravjoshi85,And the expectations falls flat,4,6 June 2020,"Nymphomaniac Vol. II is an erotic drama movie directed by Lars Von Trier and stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stacy Martin, Shia LaBeouf, Stellan Skarsgård, Christian Slater, Jamie Bell and Willem Dafoe in the leads.The movie is second part of the movie with the same name.Honestly I was very much impressed with the first part and was hoping for a much better second version as the expectations were high but my expectations falls flat.In the first part of the movie the director had focused on the correct path but in this part the movie deviates from it's original plot.In the second part the movie is much more violent, gruesome and yes very disturbing. I was shaken by the abortion scene and had a thought in mind that the director could've avoided going so much explicit. There are few such violent scenes along with lots of expected nudity.The acting in this part is also good and climax is impressive. Screenplay is slow and can get painfully boring.To be honest I was hoping a much better second part but the movie fails to impress.P.S.- The movie is very violent and disturbing so discretion is advised.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
26,TdSmth5,Interesting but not deep enough,7,26 February 2015,"Review of the shorter version Volume II continues where Vol I left off. But now Joe notices something interesting about Seligman. In all her stories so far, he hasn't shown any excitement about the sexual aspects, rather he draws these far-fetched intellectual parallels to something completely unrelated. We do learn something relevant about him.But Joe continues. In her youth she had some religious experience--her first orgasm, which happened with no physical contact. Then she picks up the thread again of her frustrating frigidity. She tries to regain pleasure by trying to have sex with foreign strangers in a threesome that doesn't go anywhere. Then she starts making appointments with a sadist, who has the ritual all laid out. And after a series of visits and plenty of beatings and butt-slappings she regains her ability to feel sexual pleasure. But in the meantime she has lost her family. This chapter takes up a whole hour.Next, her office boss makes her seek therapy. At first she sees herself as different from the rest of the sex addicts. Then she does accept the process only later to once again flip out at claim to be different and special from the rest.In the final chapter, she tells how she joins a ""debt collections"" team. While the rest of course are willing to resort to violence, she specializes in using her knowledge of men and their weaknesses to get the darkest truths out of them which would serve as blackmail material if they aren't willing to pay. She tells a story of one man who apparently had no such dark desires. She uses all her knowledge to no avail until she realizes that the guy is a pedophile. Surprisingly she ends up giving him sexual pleasure because she feels some affinity with him as complete outsiders.For no good reason her boss asks her to take on a pupil, some little girl. She and Joe eventually become romantically involved. For the girl's first solo job the subject is...Jerome and over time he and the girl become involved. This leads us to the point where Vol I starts, we learn how Joe ended up beaten in the Alley and who beat her and why.At this point Joe is tired and goes to sleep. It's now that Seligman develops a sexual interest and he returns to her room while she's sleeping. So far, it wasn't clear why this movie is supposed to be part of von Trier's depression trilogy. But at the very last moment it becomes clear.Vol. II is sexually stronger than vol. I. The sadism therapy is no doubt unusual but entertaining to see. The lovely Stacy Martin only appears for a short time and is then replaced by the ghastly Gainsbourg. The great Udo Kier gets only an insignificant role unfortunately. For all the importance Joe gives to restoring her sexuality, once she has recovered it she doesn't do anything with it; no orgies to make up for lost time or anything of the sort. Joe's work with organized crime really comes out of nowhere. Also, how the relationship with her pupil turns out is a bit far-fetched. And the outcome overall vis-a-vis Seligman is indeed rather sad.Regarding Nymphomaniac as a whole, despite all the fuss, Joe's sexuality isn't all that at the center of things, or if it is, it's rather an empty sexuality and not something she nor Seligamn dwell into more deeply. What led her to define herself as a nymphomaniac? Or once her wild teen years were over, why did she stay on that course? Seligman's observations, while occasionally bright, aren't bright enough and don't get to the core of things.On another level, Seligman (the happy one) lives a life opposite to that of Joe. And he does seem more in peace with himself, dedicated as he is, to matters of the intellect and not of the genitals. While the insatiable Joe, well, when she has sex it consumes her, when she's not experiencing pleasure, the absence of it consumes her as well. You can try to master sexuality or become its slave, either way you can't live without it nor entirely with it without losing yourself.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
27,Amari-Sali,"The poetic nature of Volume I leaves for a more raw, deviantly sexual viewing experience.",7,26 May 2014,"Trigger Warning(s): Scenes of bondageI'm going to say off the bat that Volume I certainly was more enjoyable than volume II, and there are various reasons. Some being story/ aesthetics wise and another reason being shallow. To explain, in this volume adult Joe begins divulging what makes her see herself as a horrible person, as well as introducing herself as more than a narrator, but the star. Making me think, because Stacy Martin is, to me, more attractive than Gainsbourg, it made Gainsbourg as lead a bit harder to deal. Which, admittedly, is a fault in my person, but I feel I should note that before I go on since my bias may show.Characters & StoryVolume II may as well have the subtitle of ""The Fall of Joe"" for in the 2nd volume is where she goes from sex connoisseur to full blown addict. Joe (Stacy Martin/ Charlotte Gainsbourg) now finds herself fully in love with Jerome (Shia LaBeouf) but seemingly her clitoris is unable to respond to sexual pleasure, creating a unique problem in their relationship. One which ends her monogamy and leads her back to having multiple sex partners.Then, there is an odd jump of 3 years in which Martin switches with Gainsbourg and yet LaBeouf stays himself. With this, you see an odd push to assert Gainsbourg as the turning point for when sex went from something she owned, and used for pleasure, to becoming an addiction. But, while older Joe speaks her stories, she starts to really paint herself as pretentious and rather than try to create a mutual understanding, in some fashion, with Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard), they battle wits, opinions, and he her prejudices.Somehow though, as the story comes to an end, they find themselves at a beginning of a friendship. For, with Seligman justifying and explaining Joe's negative actions with a positive spin whenever he can, he seemingly becomes the first one since B to really be her friend. And, with him being asexual, never mind a male, it is honestly perplexing. Though, at the end, a surprise comes for Joe and leaves us with a black screen and gaping mouth.PraiseQuite honestly, I feel very much reeled in like the fish Seligman speaks on in Volume I. With Martin's Joe, it distracts you because she is pretty and naturally seeing a youthful and nice body is what sells in the Hollywood market. But then, you get caught in the net and discover Gainsbourg is the true Joe. And with this, you realize a sense of shallowness for it is easy to accept Martin as Joe, but an adjustment to see Gainsbourg. And I must admit this is worth applause.It truly makes all the conversations between Joe and Seligman make sense for, in essence, what they speak of is sort of how they plan to make you feel in the end. And for one scene, Seligman sort of rebukes, or gives his own review, of all that has happened which I found to be very astute. The idea is that Joe being a woman, owning her sex and sexuality, is only interesting because she is a woman. Be it a man and no real thought would come of it since that is normalized. Much less, thinking of Gainsbourg as sexual is truly a step beyond the comforts of the viewer, and it makes for a realization on how screwed up your own thinking is, or maybe.CriticismI must say though, one issue I had with this volume is the poetic bits were replaced with sexual brutality in the form of bondage. In the first volume, there was a conversational, and poetic, nature to Joe explaining, and telling, her story. However, as Joe decides to walk into the Western Church, which is a reference you need to watch the movie to understand, there is an unfortunate drop of quality which I won't say solely is due to mental comparisons between Martin and Gainsbourg, but I will say that Volume II certainly felt less inclined of restraining itself, and with this came much more discomfort as we watch Gainsbourg do more than have sex, but be physically brutalized. And with these scenes, you realize that after being desensitized in the first volume, Von Trier likely looked to shock you and wake you up from complacency in such a way to be unable to condone Joe as Seligman has. Which, in itself, perhaps is more a praise than critique, but I do feel if you watched this in one sit through, if it wasn't for the sounds of Joe in agony, you'd likely be bored enough to fall asleep.Overall: TV ViewingArguably, if volume I was made three hours and there was aggressive editing in volume II, they could work as one movie. However, for reasons I don't know, they were split and combined make 4 hours. Of which, after the first two hours I do feel there is this high on seeing what comes next, and as that high lowers, Von Trier and the cast look for other, and very cheap ways, to keep your attention. And be it my bias, which I have already noted, or Gainsbourg as an actress beside Martin, I just felt Gainsbourg worked well as a narrator, but didn't find a way to hold onto your attention once Martin was dismissed. Be it because Joe, in her adult years, wasn't this silly flirt, or because Joe's life became systematic and a bit boring to watch, I can't fully say. Either way, I'd say that Volume I is superior, and Volume II will likely remind you why most sequels are horrible, and a bit uncalled for.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

In Von Trier's ideal world, he would have been around to defend a captive Hitler at the Nuremberg Trials. But life sucks for Lars--the Emoter behind MELANCHOLIA--and he's been reduced to spending the dough of his Eurotrash cronies in making attack after attack upon Womankind.

29,brchthethird,"As a standalone film, the lesser of the two",8,14 November 2014,"NYMPHOMANIAC: VOLUME II continues the story of Joe, but this time it delves into darker dramatic territory. While VOLUME I maintained a fairly light and playful tone, augmented with humorous observations and flourishes, VOLUME II takes a more sober and (at times) cynical view of sexuality and the human experience. In no way should this be viewed as being inconsistent with the first part, because it naturally follows that Joe's narrative trajectory would lead to places that this film explores. In this way, you can see the two parts as two halves of a narrative arc. Somewhere between a third and halfway through, Joe reaches a point where coitus no longer satisfies her intense desires and she turns to other methods in order to fulfill them. Also, in this part the observations are less humorous and quirky. Instead, they are more didactic and take a harsher psychological examination of the core themes in the movie. We also get a more nuanced look at Seligman's character who, up until this point, had merely been a listener/observer and mediator. The movie also takes a last minute turn which at first was a bit head-scratching, but then begins to make sense and can be appreciated as somewhat apropos and darkly humorous. Kudos to Von Trier for this tour de force of filmmaking. No one else could have pulled this off, let alone have the guts to even try to make it. Even though I feel like this half was the lesser of the two, taken together they make an art-house epic for the modern era, and a cinematic masterpiece.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
30,aciessi,A Slight Miscarriage,8,15 March 2015,"While Volume 1 was a cheerful exploration of devilish promiscuity, Volume 2 is a Greek tragedy that gives you philosophical whiplash. It's not quite the feat of exuberance that the first installment was, but it does compensate with it's razor sharp screenplay, a world-class performance by Gainsbourg, and a clear risk to be utterly unpleasant. The Unrated cut includes one of the most disgusting sequences in film history.. a graphic depiction of a home-made abortion. Joe transitions here from a insatiably lustful teenager, to an radical feminist, immoral beast. Von Trier, through this entire ordeal, has successfully captured how unromantic sex can possibly be. As a whole, Nymphomaniac is a sadomasochist epic, that in truth, shouldn't be missed by any cinephile.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
31,AngelHonesty,And it continues....,4,5 August 2021,"Part two is definitely more entertaining than part one. Vol 2 takes a darker twist into the sexual life of Joe's life, the first film was more so about the innocent adventures of sex, but now its about wanting more and making some really messed up choices with those wants. The sex is just as vivid as the first film if not even more so. The movie is slow and dragging as the first, but if you endured the first then you know what to expect in the second. The only big downfall to the film was the ending. I knew it was coming as most foreign films seem to have the worst endings. After enduring this entire long dreary film, I was furious with how it ended. I will never watch this again.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
32,petarmatic,As excellent as the first part if not better!,8,13 March 2014,"Just to continue with salutations of this two films. I have to repeat, just as I did for part one how this is excellent.Here I will talk a little bit about music, and how well it fit into the framework of the film. Bach, Bethoveen, probably two most well known musicians in history. I am so glad they were in this film connected with sex, because music has an erotic component to it. It touches the same part of the brain as sex does. Well don Von Trier! Well done! In one part of the film I really like the shots of the legs working the organ pedals. I really like the choice of the shoes. :) In one part of the film main female character talks about how pedophiles who do not go into realization of their need deserve a medal. Well, I tend to agree, pedophilia is not accepted in the developed societies, and pedophiles who dare to go into realization of their need are often crucified, their life and their family becomes pure hell, not to say the jail time they have to do. Just as it is mentioned in the film 95 per cent of the pedophiles do not dare to go into realization of their need. Their life is agonizing and filled with frustration, and because of that they often become burden to the society. They often are not able to contribute to the society well and are often burden to the society and their families. All in all many books and films are being made about pedophilia and no society really rooted out pedophilia. I am afraid it is going to stay with us as long as there is humanity, just as other, so called, deviant sexual behaviors. Let us not forget their victims who also live a hell of their own. Not a happy situation, to all sides concerned.All in all please take time to see both of these films. They really deserve it!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
33,asda-man,As erotic as a whipped arse,9,1 June 2014,"Volume II has had less favourable reviews than volume I and I suppose I can see why. It's much darker and harder to watch. It also takes a slower pace and isn't as funny. However, I found it to be just as excellent as the first volume. I may be biased here, as I am into dark and depressing films. I especially love Lars' more depressing and emotional films, Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves, so volume II was a powerful and satisfying experience for me.We delve deeper into Joe's dark side as she explores the more disturbing side of sexual stimulation by attending some highly un-erotic classes with Billy Elliot. These scenes are probably the hardest to watch in the whole film. Fifty Shades of Grey it ain't! The chapter is extremely well-made though. From the moment Joe sets foot in the eerie building, there's an extremely uncomfortable atmosphere and a sense of terrible foreshadowing. Some have said that these masochistic scenes go on for too long, but I felt that the length was necessary to really show the weight of Joe's nymphomania and how it's totally disturbing her life. Jamie Bell is also very good in these scenes.What I did find a little odd though was the jump from Stacy Martin to Charlotte Gainsbourg. Three years later and she morphs into a completely different-looking person and has aged about 20 years! It didn't really work and sort of brought you out of the film a little bit. Another thing which I find really bizarre was the blatant self-reference to Anti-Christ! Granted there are many nods throughout the two volumes to Lars' other work, which is fine because it's pretty fun if you're a fan (like me!) to spot Joe wearing the same prostitute clothes as Bess from Breaking the Waves. However, one scene is pretty much a remake of the opening to Antichrist with the same music and everything. I found this extremely odd and it did serve to bring me out of the film.These were my only jibes with the film though really. On the whole it's a very rich, intelligent and thoughtful experience. It didn't feel like two hours at all because I was so sucked into the story and really interested in Joe's life. She's such a complex character and a very interesting one to listen to. It was also nice to see more of Charlotte Gainsbourg here as I think she's a very underrated actress. Her monotone voice is weirdly hypnotic to listen to and you believe everything she does. All of the performances were excellent though.Not many people seem to talk about the latter half of the film, which is strange because I found it very interesting. I especially found the whole paedophilia talk interesting and it was very taboo-breaking and brave of Lars to include this, but then again he's never been afraid of being a little provocative. I found the whole relationship with P quite moving, and the sex therapy scenes were wonderfully awkward. One of the best moments is when Joe recalls climbing a mountain and finding her 'soul tree'. It's so beautifully done with gorgeous cinematography and music.The ending was very touching, of course up until the very last moment. I'm not quite sure how to feel about the ending. It's very provocative and has got people talking. It's interesting but I'm not sure if I like it. I'm also not too sure if it should be taken so literally. In fact, I'm not too sure if the whole film should be taken so literally as it's unclear if some parts are Joe's delusions. It's very interesting.Although I watched the two volumes a day apart, I think that I could quite easily watch it all in one go. It all went by quite quickly for me and nothing felt too long. In the end I think that Nymphomaniac is one of the best films Lars has ever done. It's probably my favourite out of the depression trilogy by a hair. It's brilliantly directly and is full of an energy, life and soul which many films lack. It's very explicit with a lot of erections and fadge close-ups, but none of it felt gratuitous. Lars has created a rich and powerful film. Yes, there may be a few hiccups, but anyone would expect a few hiccups in a film that is four hours in length.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
34,rubenm,Not as good as part 1,7,3 February 2014,"After having enjoyed the superb first part of 'Nymphomaniac', I felt a little bit disappointed by the second part of this film. It is less imaginative, less playful and less exuberant.What's missing most is the interaction between the two lead characters: sex addict Joe and her asexual rescuer Seligman. In the first part, their conversation was like ping pong: they exchanged stories and experiences - hers of a sexual nature, his about all kinds of things. The links and similarities between their seemingly different lives made the film so original and attractive. In the second part however, it's mostly Joe who tells the stories. Seligman is reduced to a minor part, that of the patient listener. Only at a few occasions he really contributes something to the conversation, but after one of his stories, Joe remarks: 'I think this is one of your weakest digressions'. After that, he lets her do the talking. Even more than in the first part, Von Trier explores all kinds of (sexual) taboos. There's paedophilia (on which Joe has rather original but very wise views), interracial sex, sado-masochism, and all kinds of humiliation. In between, Von Trier also gives us his unorthodox thoughts on motherhood and feminism. At several occasions, it's clear how we hear Von Trier speak through the words of his protagonist. There's a nice exchange of arguments about political correctness between Joe and Seligman. He thinks the word Negro shouldn't be used, out of respect for a part of society. She thinks that not allowing the use of certain words, is equal to forbidding certain thoughts. Political correctness is hypocrisy, she thinks. Coming from a man like Von Trier, who has committed his life to the combat against political correctness, this is a clear statement. The same goes for the scene where Joe, after having decided to attend a self help group for sex addicts, accuses the group leader of being a member of some sort of obscenity police. This is a clear message to all narrow-minded people who described 'Nymphomaniac' as porn, before having seen one second of it. Because Von Trier so clearly has no respect for what society considers decent or proper, I was amazed by Seligmans feminist speech at the end of the film. He comforts Joe by pointing out that her behaviour as a nymphomaniac would probably be applauded if she had been a man. That a woman cannot dedicate her life to limitless sex, is proof of society's double standards. Of course this is true, but it sounds strange after so much scenes in which women are being degraded. After having seen Nymphomaniac part 1 and part 2, I am really curious about the director's cut. Is it just more explicit sex? I hope not, because showing genitals is clearly not what makes this film great. It's everything else that should make you want to go and see it.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
35,RevRonster,It was hard to not laugh at the end...,3,14 October 2014,"Overall, I thought the first one was okay. Even though a majority of the time I was bored with the story, I did think it was somewhat interesting and I felt the acting was very good in it. I also felt the real sex element of the film was nothing more than a gimmick to create buzz but it wasn't so bad that it tossed me out of the film. However, I didn't really feel the same in the second installment.While the acting is still good in this film (seriously, Charlotte Gainsbourg is very good in the movie) and the film actually starts to build quite well from where the first one left off, the story hits its Third Act on such a silly note that I couldn't take the movie seriously and it felt like it validated my thoughts that the real sex part was just a gimmick. While the movie doesn't go overboard to the point of something like Joe uses her nymphomania to win the presidency, the development of her career becoming a debt collector and using her knowledge of sex in this career path was just too out-there for me when compared to the beginning of the two volumes. It didn't help either that Joe decides to take on an apprentice who decides to go all Darth Vader on her Emperor Palpatine. Till this point, the film was progressing and developing nicely but this evolution was something that I just couldn't get into—which is a big problem because, despite how good the acting was, the characters were just people I couldn't fully invest in.With this element of the story rubbing me the wrong way and immediately taking out even the smallest amount of investment I made into Joe's story, it ended up making me feel like I was right that the real sex part was just a gimmick to get talk about the film going because it feels like that was the priority and the drama and story were the afterthought. Yes, all films have their own particular gimmick they are sold on but sometimes those gimmicks made the film feel lazy because that was where all the attention went. Granted, ""Nymphomaniac Vol. II"" isn't as bad as a ""found footage"" gimmick but it did make me feel like Lars von Trier was more worried about getting people excited about a movie that contains real sex than he was about telling a naturally developing story.Still, through it all, the acting is still really good. I just didn't really care for this one because, along with the problems I had in the story, I just couldn't invest myself fully into the characters. In the end, the film is just not my cup of teaand, honestly, tea isn't really my cup of tea.Howdy! My name is Rev.

36,bbickley13-921-58664,Not as good as Vol I,5,6 April 2014,"Honestly, I thought the movie was a little boring. Nymphomaniac volume II had the same issue that Kill Bill vol 2 had. Though both movies have the same tone, Kill Bill vol 2 runs at a different pace, and I was feeling that somewhat with vol II of Nymphomaniac, but while Kill Bill vol 2 was still entertaining, I was missing that with the second Volume of Nymphomaniac.Interesting enough, the strange turn Vol 2 takes is what I expected from Lars Von Tier. It's almost like Vol I was met to be an entertaining more main stream movie, while this one tries to express a darker format, but while I see Vol 1 as a complete movie, Vol 2 felt like what was left over from Vol 1.I purposely went to see Vol 2 almost a week after vol 1 so I can keep Vol 1 fresh in the head while I watched Vol 2, figuring like Kill Bill it would work like two movies split in half. If that was the filmmaker's purpose, than Vol 2 acts as a very lackluster final act.Maybe I'll get more satisfaction from the movie if I watched both volumes back to back, but as a Standalone, I feel Vol 1 was the highlight of the story and could have ended there.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

38,estreet-eva,Less pointless sleaziness than the 1st but not much better,3,3 February 2015,"Although shot as one film, the second half of Von Trier's pornographic decent into debauchery at least picks up some substance as the titular character Joe starts to suffer for her obsession. The purposeful shock value remains high with scenes pulled directly from interracial porn and from ""50 Shades of Grey"". Von Trier plays some of these as dark comedy but more of the snort rather than laugh out loud variety. At least we do get to see some real outcomes from the real condition of sex addiction (as opposed to the pretend kind that Tiger Woods had so he could go back to endorsing products after ""rehab"") including job loss and having to go to meetings. Joe's choice of abandoned her son to feed her compulsion makes her less of a charactacture. However, the overall sleaze of the enterprise still makes this one to avoid.

She also becomes annoyed with Seligman, accusing him of overlooking the severity of her lost sexuality to focus on the allegorical before realizing he can't relate to her stories. He goes on to confirm his asexuality and virginity, but assures her his lack of bias and ""innocence"" is what makes him the right man to hear her story.

42,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,25 September 2014,"6/10 My general thoughts of this movie are exactly the same as in Volume I. It is well acted and has some genuine reflections on humanity, furthermore there are times where Volume II is legitimately funny. The sex isn't pornographic at all, on the contrary it is actually very disturbing at times in this one. Intrestingly enough it has the same problem of it's predecessor: a very strong first half, with very well played out scenes and deep existential issues, and a weak, very weak second half. The reason why my grade is lower than Volume I is because the second half really was flat out boring. In the first movie the second half had its moment of excessive weirdness and bore but it managed to go on fluently thanks to the work of Skarsgaard and Gainsbourg in the room where they're talking, here in Volume II there's just nothing. I can't even remember parts of it because it was so uninteresting and moreover it kept being pretty unbelievable. I still don't know how I feel about the passage in which pedophilia is discussed because I was just so out of it. The third act really lost me here. But as soon as we understand how Joe got where she is I was in once again: going back to the room where she is telling her story. And there the ending came: I loved it! I thought it was brilliant and brave and I didn't not see out of character behaviour as some others pointed out. In the end the Nymphomaniac four hour movie has very, very interesting points to raise and some magnificent filmaking talent, but this is crushed by an overlong and sometimes underwhelming continuity in the scenes.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
43,eagandersongil,Loss of pleasure and loss of genius. But the gain of criticism,9,7 January 2017,"Part 2 of nymphomaniac loses its genius, but not its quality, we have a script that surrenders to more utopian plots and loses its criticism, but, it remains a movie well above the average, we have a whole discourse around fetishes, of Abortion and gives odious social nature. We continue to follow the story of Joe's life, this time his story brings more social critiques than the philosophical discourse of the first, technically the film is perfect, photography, editing, soundtrack, sound mixing, etc. Great acting and the good old tripodless camera from Lars. If you followed the full version of the movie (which has three hours), you will see many scenes that in most parts of the movies are unnecessary, but here it is very, very necessary, worth a highlight to the abortion scene, explicitly, it shocks, leaves The agonized viewer, makes you squeeze the couch and look down, Lars Von Trier is a genius in building this kind of scene, after the abortion itself we have another 7 minutes of speech about the event, that discourse is not taken , All kinds of arguments are presented and the conclusion is for the viewer, who is always remembered in the plot, Lars Von Trier makes us remember that we are watching a movie about sex, and from there we extract the philosophy, the whole Lars does not develop it, it disturbs him, he does not like it, he does not like it, he does not like it, When you think that this story will be developed, Lars puts another story for us, but towards the end of the film we have banal motivations, even so, its ending is great.  SPOILER :::: Lars could end the movie with Joe sleeping and ended, but he makes his (asexual) listener want to have sex with Joe, and instead of just accepting, Joe kills her. Joe passes the whole movie thinking that she is a bad person, at a certain moment she blames the elite on her not framing, even so, for Joe, all that bad happens to the people around her is his fault, but in that last one Moment she realizes that society is bad and corrupt, and can be expressed in just one word, as Joe himself says, ""Hypocrite."" Joe and may even surface the worst in people, but she's not bad on her own.

Even though Stacy Martin as the younger Joe is a bit lacking in affect, the later scenes with Charlotte Gainsbourg can be pretty hard to take as Joe becomes obsessed with a repulsive dungeon master, then gets a gig as a subcontractor for slimy extortionist Willem Dafoe (the only unsubtle casting choice, btw). The comic relief—a tryst with a pair of African guys—isn't nearly as entertaining as Uma Thurman's amazing scene in Vol. I, though I'm guessing the extra footage (sic!) in the extended director's cut may really make it work. (Connoisseurs of uncut schlangs may not mind that the punchline appears to be lacking.) If you're okay with lots of on-screen sadomasochism and psychological torture (including on the part of the director), simulated (and unsimulated) sex and all-around depravity, then I cautiously recommend Vol. II.

46,troyputland,Lars von Trier up to his usual tricks again.,3,2 July 2015,"Lars von Trier. If you know the name then you're aware of the avant-garde, ambiguous style he produces in every feature film he's made. Nymphomaniac, with its two parts and 240 minute running time, has its cast practicing real sex acts. It's the sole reason why this film has garnered so much attention. Overlooked is everything else in between. Joe (Gainsbourg) tells her tale of emotional and physical highs and lows to Seligman (Skarsgard), a dutiful, friendly fellow that helps her after an assault. Her life's story is split up into metaphorical chapters, from the moment she finds her sexuality as a young girl, up to present day. Gainsbourg is a fine example of ideal casting, looking the part before baring any skin. Her story telling is clunky and disjointed. Lars von Trier's scriptwriting is dry, elusive and as ambiguous as a white canvas. The C word's blurted out more times by Gainsbourg than seen, grating like nails on a chalkboard. The acting's authentic, by all accounts (most notable is Stacy Martin playing young Joe), but only when dialogue is absent (Shia LaBeouf's accent is diabolical). The scenes that contain nudity represent nymphomania. Porn's toes are not being trod on. Nymphomaniac's easier to digest than other LvT films.

47,ghost_dog86,"The Real ""Fifty Shades of Grey""",9,19 April 2014,"Throwing most of the penetrative sex to the wayside and replacing it with a bit of blasphemy and fetish stuff, what can I say? Like an intellectually engaging college lecture where no theories are off limits, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Nymphomaniac: Vol. 2"". In my opinion, ""Vol. 2"" is where the mind of writer/director Lars von Trier really begins to emerge. Meaning, if the first one wasn't for you, then know that the second half is thematically darker and contains a lot more theological toe stepping, as a majority of the sexual exploits have visual tie-ins to or mimic biblical events. While nothing here is said or done without reasoning or in an exploitative manner, and on a technical level von Trier does some of his best work (on the page and screen) there are things in ""Vol. 2"" which are far more uncomfortable to sit through than seeing Shia LeBeouf's penis. Here is an example: There is a sequence of dialogue which attempts to defend pedophilia as a forbidden sexuality that some people are simply born with. Yeah, it's that kind of movie.""Vol. 2"" is all about exploring the mental and emotional side of sexual desires, as well as a semi-commentary on what kinds of sex acts modern society's repressions have given birth to.The much anticipated ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" movie is set to come out next year. But what could that movie show me that Lars hasn't already? Like many limit pushing films, the most important sequences are also the one hardest to watch. As explicitly in your face as the sex was in ""Vol. 1"", it's the unsettling S&M sequences which will illicit the most visceral response from audiences and critics alike, because of how far von Trier pushes the contact between the actors (I'm sure it was all camera tricks, but DAMN!) in conjunction with how each abused character reacts to their punishment.The only hiccup here comes with von Trier's over eagerness to switch out actors as they pass into adulthood (Stacy Martin is now played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). The latter half of this movie sees LaBeouf's character awkwardly replaced by another actor, which unlike the Martin to Gainsbourg transition, becomes the slightest bit confusing.Final Thought: While ""Vol. 1"" has a ton of interesting theories about adolescent sexual motivations, it will unfortunately be judged on its visual shock value; challenging audiences as to whether or not they are truly uncomfortable with the naked body. ""Vol. 2"" however is more about challenging audiences' sexual theories. If one sees a naked body on screen, one can always walk out of the theater. But once you hear a theory that may contradict your own morality, you either must metaphorically cover your ears or let the idea marinate inside of you, challenging views that you may hold sacred. And in that way ""Vol. 2"" is more antagonistic. But this is what von Tier does best; shoves taboo ideas into your face until you either walk out or open yourself up to a dialogue.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
48,the_wolf_imdb,And now Lars von Trier has destroyed the sex itself,1,30 October 2016,"I have written quite exhaustive review of this movie but Socialist State of IMDb kinda prohibits some words - but in a very Kafkaesque manner does not explain which ones. That's somewhat unfortunate as the movie Nymphomaniac can only be described by words that describe some mature content activities. I mean some really depraved mature content activities.Even though there is a lot of mature activity going around in this four hour long movie it is also unbelievably dull and boring. It is really hard to describe four hours long intellectual exchange so to speak between utterly depraved female character that seems to ask for understanding and her supposed intellectual savior. Philosophy, music, arts, the topics you would expect to be discussed between an old loner and insane sex addict - at least if you are modern intellectual leftist. It is so excruciatingly boring, long and really painful to watch. I kinda loved early Trier works like Kingdom Hospital but this is just beyond horrible. The main female character is supposed to be some sort of female suffering from masculine and capitalist oppression, but she only abuses others - males, females, her own son, everyone. Its sick character only getting sicker as movie progresses. There is no resolution at the end, no salvation, no conclusion, no mercy, no atonement, not a single spark of light at the end of the tunnel. The main heroine is simply sick psychopath who should be treated at the closed psychiatric ward as she descends just from from perverted to simply dangerous and evil.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
49,lucasnochez,Review--Nymphomaniac: Volume II/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,9,28 March 2014,"Leaving us on the cusp of comingto any real closure with our young protagonist Joe (Stacy Martin), von Trier throws quite the curve ball with his character and the overall story, allowing the narrative to take an unexpected turn. After five chapters in the life of Joe's deranged and numb life, we continue into her sexual escapades as she becomes a woman, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Nymphomaniac: Volume II picks up exactly where Volume I left off, and doesn't leave any sex or shock behind. Instead, Volume II is the overly stimulated, ultra aroused, and intellectually charged sexual explicit drama that Volume I never was.Although the film was never meant to be split into two parts, and von Trier intended the film to be his original five and a half hour long cut, Volume II is the complex and deep answer to a conventionally linear sexually charged character piece that was Volume I. Think of Nymphomaniac in the same way as you would Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill saga. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is soaked with violence and bloodshed, making great use of the magic of movie spectacle and serving as a valiant homage to so many of the films Tarantino grew up with and loved.Kill Bill: Vol. 2, a film that infuses so many of the complex philosophies Tarantino has cherished, as well as surely inducting many of his own radical and absurd justifications without much violence, spectacle or gore, the film becomes a philosophical, witty and complex story with an understanding of his protagonist's psyche and the reason behind her vengeance. Now picture Nymphomaniac: Volume II in the same way as Kill Bill: Vol. 2, but instead of violence, substitute it for graphic nudity and sexual acts (although it is not nearly as subtracted as the violence in Vol.2 of Kill Bill). So basically, the second film in von Trier's carnal opus is a long-winded, understanding of Joe's addiction and the ways in which she tries to subdue it, or if anything, control it.Volume II descends to the deep and dark corners of a woman who no longer finds simple penetrative intercourse pleasurable. When sex is not enough, what happens? If Joe is any indication of real world nymphomaniacs and the paths they follow in order to find pleasure, von Trier never prepares us for the unexpected directions Joe goes, desperately to find pleasure, at any cost.There is no doubting that Joe finds erotic pleasure in the most taboo places and scenarios. She purposely pulls the wires from her car to attract a large crowd of men, who she presumably goes back to have sex with as the camera pans out. She finds strangers on the street, specifically two black men, who so happen to be brothers, to penetrate her at the same time. The scene, which is a big production still that was used towards the marketing of the film, is less graphic and erotic than what you would imagine, and instead more hysterical as it unfolds, especially with the quarrels of the two men. In Joe's last attempt to find pleasure with a 'cunt' that has failed her, Joe finds a man by the name of K (Jamie Bell), an expert in the brutal art of bondage/BDSM whom she finds stimulating through violence and pain. Her relationship is one that she sacrifices the most for as she becomes a woman and a business professional, compromising her health, the little family Joe has, and of course, the limits of her addiction. Volume II of the saga explores the ways in which people find meaning in their addictions without penetration, although they are overall, mostly naturally and habitually inclined to express themselves through intercourse.If you know anything about Lars von Trier, you would know that he is a man with many phobias. An intense fear of flying and various bouts of serious depression, the director is a man who implements so many of his phobias onto his characters, especially Nymphomaniac. Ironically enough, since his declaration to never be part of interviews or press conferences again since his last conference at Cannes accused him of loving Hitler and being a Satanist, Volume II has a lot of bottled up feelings the director has been dying to express–in controversial fashion.Throughout Joe's narration of her life to Seligman (Skarsgård), he describes her actions to those of a man's behaviour of sex. For the most part, Joe is always powerless to her men, especially in the scenes with K (Bell) who appropriately gives her the alias Fido, a name predominantly used for a dog. Joe is submissive and obedient to anything K says, including tying her to couches, chairs or asked to stand still, unflinching, regardless of the painful outcome. Although Joe seems to give all the power to her sexual partners, there is no denying the control she has over them, mentally persuading them to adhere to her requests.Can't get enough Nymphomaniac: Volume II?

50,jmillerdp,"Slightly More Interesting Than ""Part I""",4,12 August 2014,"The characters' journeys in ""Part II"" are thankfully a bit more interesting than they were in ""Part I."" Stellan Skarsgård is again much more interesting than the ""Joe"" character, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stacy Martin.But, at least here, Joe begins to go through some catharsis regarding her condition. Naturally, that doesn't last long. So, she's still irredeemable and unpleasant.One thing you quickly notice is how Gainsbourg and Martin look nothing alike! When they make the direct transition between them here, it's pretty jarring.Again, there's lots of random nudity and sex acts performed, but in the same unerotic way they were shown in ""Part I."" There is also plenty of sadomasochism, which might get off the ""50 Shades"" crowd. And, there are also a number of just plain sadists running around, which is unpleasant. I guess that's von Trier's intent.The ending seemed to be leading to something worthwhile, until von Trier inexplicably throws in a ""shock"" ending that is completely inconsistent with what came before.

51,FilmMuscle,Just a Porno Disguised as a Film?,9,6 April 2014,"It is a known fact that Lars Von Trier is one of the most daring filmmakers in the industry today, never caring how our socially sensitive and politically correct society will interpret his work. I applaud and highly respect him for his ambition in tackling uncomfortable subject matter but not pursuing it in a solely provocative way—instead always deriving deep meaning from topics like sex, violence, loneliness, melancholy, and more. Right from the get-go—at the dawn of its official announcement—plenty of people began labeling it as just a porno that's disguised as a film. Right, like anything dealing with pervasive sex is a pornowhich means the abundance of excessively violent films in Hollywood should be considered snuff films, right, if I were to be using the same logic? I always found it hilarious how a generally slutty culture is offended when the same sex they obsess over and constantly converse about finds itself in movies and shows. Do I sense a double standard? Von Trier won't exactly care to heed any criticism on the copious nudity and copulation found in his newest project just like the film's protagonist, Joe (her younger self played by Stacy Martin and her middle-aged self played by Charlotte Gainsbourg), confidently pursues her sexual addiction and attempts to ignore society's gasps. Nymphomaniac essentially captures a sex addict's highly wild and eventful journey into middle age, and boy, is it compelling. For those who don't yet know, it's a film split into two parts: the first volume (sitting at 1 hr. 58 mins.) and the second volume (2 hrs. 3 mins.). For a 4-hour film, it never feels too long or dragged out. I don't feel anything was unnecessarily inserted, and there was never a wish for it to finally end. In fact, I've been incessantly thinking about it a day later; it's just so thematically captivating as it explores the hypocrisies of society and the shallow perspectives on unusual behaviors within. For instance, a restrained pedophile is deemed drastically more nefarious than a ruthlessly promiscuous individual as some moviegoers narrow-mindedly pointed out merely after seeing a film that surely strives to maturely address it. The emphasis of one's sexuality, whether it's unorthodox or not, is clearly the film's primary goal. In another example, men are never ashamed of being whores but a woman should be? The traditions of culture and society seem to think so. There are a plethora of socially crucial themes scrutinized therein, which highlights the film's overall heavily thought-provoking material and definitely ensures memorability. In addition, this picture boasts a tremendous cast, featuring the likes of Shia LaBeouf, Stellan Skarsgård, Uma Thurman, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Bell, Christian Slater, and many more, fully delivering with some incredibly strong acting. You will witness a disturbing and deranged nature in some of them and feel vast sympathy for the others, but one thing's for certain: it'll be impossible to forget such impactful performances/roles after the film is long done. Now, the question really is which volume did I prefer? And my answer would be Volume 2 even though many are picking the first one due to its larger supply of humor and fun. That honestly sounds ridiculous to me because when I entered Von Trier's latest, the last thing I expected was hilarity or amusement. Volume 2 is undoubtedly dark and more depressing, and I absolutely loved it simply because that was the whole damn point of the film. Being a sex addict is NOT a good thing as much as a lascivious society seems to think so. The account of a sex addict shouldn't be a humorous and lighthearted commentary, and Volume 2 exhibits the numerous plights and issues that arise as a result of pursuing a wanton life but never to a condescending extent. I never felt—for a moment—that the movie was obviously against one thing or another; it's thankfully not a message film. It presents more ambiguity in its interpretation of these profound themes, and my comments could easily be disputed by other viewers. At the end of the day, I'll be remembering this film much more likely than the hyped, bombastic superhero film of the month. Nymphomaniac isn't a mindless, casual venture neither is it a pretentious, ""artsy-fartsy"" film; it lands on the right territory with enough of an intriguing grip and substance to warrant a second viewing or, at least, a long period of remembrance.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
52,murtaza_mma,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's daring treatise on lust, jealousy and solitude",9,20 April 2014,"Nymphomaniac (Vol. 2) is a 2013 Danish drama film written and directed by Lars von Trier. Before going any further it's imperative to demystify the movie's title. According to the dictionary definition, ""Nymphomania is the uncontrollable or excessive sexual desire in a woman."" So, basically, a nymphomaniac is a woman who has abnormally excessive and uncontrollable sexual desire, in other words, a female sex addict. Nymphomaniac got released internationally in form of two separate volumes of roughly two hours each. However, Lars von Trier also premiered an extended cut of the first half of the film, Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1, with 30 minutes of extra footage at the 64th Berlin Film Festival, which garnered rave reviews. This film critique doesn't analyze the two volumes separately but as a whole.Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac—a bold and daring cinematic treatise on lust, jealousy and solitude—proves to be a devastating life-changing experience that makes us question the nothingness of our existence. As a work of art, it refines ours senses and haunts our imagination with its ribald motifs and breathtaking imagery. In Nymphomaniac, Lars von Trier essentially presents, in form of eight sprawling chapters (5 in Vol. 1 and 3 in Vol. 2), the bizarre tale of a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac, named Joe, recounting her erotic experiences during the different phases of her life. Lars von Trier borrows random ideas from varied disciplines and blends them seamlessly, not only demonstrating his remarkable range as an artist but also reasserting his credentials as a filmmaker par excellence.Lars von Trier, in his characteristic style, handpicks a rather controversial subject and then gives it the most unconventional treatment. The result is an end product that's dark, diabolical, and deviously clever. The movie despite its serious outlook has an undercurrent of dark humour that harks back to von Trier's earlier works. Nymphomaniac: Vol. I, which presents Joe's younger years, unfolds at a whirlwind pace and seems to underline the unrestrained joys of female libertinism. It's a sheer delight to watch a newcomer (Stacy Martin) portray Joe's youthful years so passionately and with an air of effortless ease. Nymphomaniac: Vol. II, which has a rather somber feel thanks to a drastic tonal shift with respect to Vol. I, shows the middle-aged Joe (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg) finally come to term with the limitations, hardships and hypocrisies of a mortal's life as she ends up paying the price for her frenzied modus vivendi.Nymphomaniac is easily Lars von Trier's most accessible work till date. But, make no mistake! It's not your run-of-the-mill cinematic product. Is it pornography? According to Wikipedia, ""Pornography is the explicit portrayal of sexual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal."" Now, there's no denying that von Trier's film is quite explicit in its propagation of sexual content. But, does it serve the purpose of sexual arousal? The film evokes pathos, horror and revulsion but not an iota of sexual gratification (unless you are a pervert). Credit must go to Lars von Trier for concocting a film that in less accomplished hands could have slumped into the realm of artsy porn.In Nymphomaniac. for some uncanny reasons, Lars von Trier chooses to make his male characters either dumb or effeminate and the female characters smart and transgressing. Lars von Trier questions the elevated status of love vis-à-vis other human emotions. Lars von Trier creates a very interesting character in Seligman (Stellan Skarsgård)—an intellectual who chooses to stay a virgin all his life. According to Seligman, humanity is divided into two groups: the people who cut the fingernails of the left hand first (the light-hearted people who have a tendency to enjoy life more because they go straight for the easiest task and save the difficulties for later), and the people who cut the fingernails of the right hand first. Seligman himself belongs to second category as oppose to Joe who being a true pleasure-seeker falls in the first category. While Seligman and Joe come across as exact antithesis of each other, there's much in common between the two of them. The two are tied together by some strange bond. Is it pity or envy? In the end, Nymphomaniac poses the all-important question: Whether to express oneself or to keep oneself restrained?Overall, Nymphomaniac proves to be an endlessly fascinating work of cinema that brilliantly balances style with substance. At the same time, it's not an easy film to watch by any stretch of imagination and can pose serious impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Nymphomaniac features a lot many memorable sequences. The one featuring Uma Thurman in the role of a distressed wife is definitely a cut above the rest. Then there's the movie's shocking finale that's bound to leave the viewer cold. Amidst a plethora of disturbing scenes the movie does offer few moments of respite thanks to the occasional bursts of humor. Joe's messed-up erotic encounter with two black men inside a hotel room is by far the most hilarious. The movie also features a levitation sequence that's highly reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1975 film, The Mirror aka Zerkalo (the seventh chapter of Nymphomaniac is also named as ""The Mirror""). Lars von Trier also pays tribute to Bond films. Joe's morbid sexual behavior and the underlying sexual fetishism remind one of Bunuel's remarkable 1967 film, Belle de Jour. In one of the scenes, Lars von Trier cheekily pays homage to the opening sequence of Antichrist. Nymphomaniac, in so many ways, is Lars von Trier's tribute to cinema, a solemn expression of his love and appreciation for the medium. In Nymphomaniac, Lars von Trier seems to have blatantly depicted almost all forms of human sexuality which makes Nymphomaniac a very challenging film to watch for an average viewer. But, courage and patience have their own rewards, and in this case, plenty.Rating (Vol. 1 & 2): 8.5/10A more in-depth review of the film can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
53,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn! review,7,22 February 2014,"I finally got to see the second part of Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac last night. As you might remember, I didn't really like the first part – it was mostly pretentious artsy stuff that couldn't keep me interested, and also I didn't come to the theater to masturbate, as some people seem to be doing. And seriously, how can they? I admit that this movie can make you horny, but every sex scene is coated with depression and isn't really sexy, which ultimately ruins the mood. But I digress. Nymphomaniac vol. II turned out to be quite surprising. It was better than the first part, and more interesting, as it focused more on the main character's relationship with society and how her 'condition' affected it – and therefore, it was much darker and heartfelt.Note: skip this paragraph if you plan to see the movie as a whole, as it reveals some important plot points from the first volume. In this part, Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is still telling her story to Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard), but his role is minor as he mostly listens and doesn't have many witty, maths-related remarks – which I thought was positive, and I liked that Joe asked him how could he possibly be thinking about mathematical formulas while she's talking about sex. My thoughts exactly, but this gets explained, too: Seligman is an asexual virgin. For the sake of drama, could he really have been anything else if not Joe's exact opposite? Also, this part shows us Joe ruining her monogamous life with Jerôme (Shia LaBeouf) because of her addiction, and we can finally see and understand the pain her addiction causes her.I like to think this part of the movie is more Trier-like: there is less pretentious crap and less oh-so-shocking sex, but more is said about the main character and the story actually goes somewhere (while the first part was mostly about young Joe having sex). Volume II finally tackles the subject of nymphomania as a serious addiction. Just like a junkie, Joe gives up everything for her daily dose, even her loving husband who just can't satisfy her need. And even when she, in one scene, claims she loves herself as she is – a sex addict – it's hard not to smile and feel pity for a person that tries, in every possible way, to justify her behavior, while being aware of the lies she's feeding herself with. Still, I understand why the first part of the movie is lighter and focused on Joe's sexual adventures: every addiction feels awesome at first, just like youth is a much easier life period than all that comes after. Because of this needed transition, it's much better to watch the movie as a whole, if you can manage to sit through its 4 hour entirety.It was also easier to concentrate on the actors' performances in this part of the movie. Stacy Martin is finally gone, thank God, except for a small part in the beginning that doesn't really show her bad acting. You can now really appreciate Charlotte Gainsbourg as an actress, as she does more than just sit on a bed and talk. Mia Goth is really good as P, even though this is her first role in a movie ever. Willem Dafoe got too little screen time to be really impressive, although he wasn't bad, but Jamie Bell as the sadistic K was great – so naturally intimidating, even his facial expressions make you shiver. There are still some scenes that make you cringe, the pretentiousness isn't completely gone and the movie is tedious from time to time, but I'd suggest you see it, preferably as a whole. It's not perfect, but it's definitely an interesting experience.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
54,Barev2013,"NYMPHOMANIAC, PART II - Thinly veiled porno, or a philosophical masterpiece?",9,9 November 2014,"The short version of Nympho 2 is already out on the street but this unexpurgated Directors Cut was one of the hot tickets of the latest Venice film festival, 2014. While many accuse it of being thinly viewed porno Von Trier's epic length opus is actually an extended two person discourse and heady analysis of sexual addiction, addiction in general, the foibles of the human condition, and other philosophical questions -- above all a heady indictment of hypocrisy, with many ""épater la Bourgoisie"" scenes to illustrate the points made as graphically as possible. There is plenty of explicit sex, an extended S and M section (the only boring part of the picture) Lots of detailed shots of bloody vulvas, one excruciating sequence of the heroine applying a primitive home made abortion to herself, and male members in various states of erection, including one Quickie of mature actor Skarsgard's limp pecker in the final sequence, in dim light but explicit enough to note that he was never circumcised. The three hour film went on and on for what seemed like an eternity with several anti- climaxes any of which could have made an appropriate ending , but director Lars Von Trier kept having one more thing to say in this prodigious cinematic dissertation on just about every social and philosophical issue one can think of, in addition to the central discourse on addiction to sex in every form imaginable, which is presented as a Socratic dialogue between a battered Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) the eponymous Nymphomaniac of the piece, and Seligman (Skarsgard) the kindly older intellectual who takes her in and listens to her story intently with comments and questions that constantly challenge the bare knuckle belief system of the relentlessly existentialist younger nymphomaniac. In a way she is a female equivalent of Camus' L'étranger in that she simply cannot play the usual social games people play.This was the continuation of Part I which premiered at Berlin in February and picks up where Part I left off, giving us more of the Same with even more shocking Sequences (notably, the almost unwatchable bloody self abortion scene) plus explicit sex scenes, which would count as pornography if they were not obviously meant as commentary on pornography rather than prurient interest footage per se. All such scenes are presented as flashbacks, as Joe recounts her obsessive sexual adventures to her intellectual interlocutor from a bed where, clad in pajamas, she is recovering from her latest beating in the bare room inhabited by the elder philosopher, Seligman. He claims to be totally asexual, in fact a virgin who never in his whole life had any sex of any kind, outside of a bit of adolescent masturbation, which presumably qualifies him as a perfectly objective listener. At one point Joe, who has tried just about everything but is frigid -- unable to attain orgasm no matter what she does -- decides to try sex with someone whose language she cannot understand, hence without verbal communication. Through an interpreter she selects an African man who speaks no English, but he brings along his brother and both black men ravish her simultaneously, anally and frontally with with many views of large black phalluses in action -- as the men argue heatedly in an unidentified African language for some unexplained reason -- This was clearly not simulated since we see full penetration as in ordinary hard core porno flicks so Charlotte must be given credit for sacrificing herself to total realism in these heavy f-scenes -- stills from which are major selling points for the picture. I couldn't help wondering if her deceased father Serge, himself a well known sex obsessive, would have approved of his daughter going even farther out than he himself ever did -- ""je vous aime, moi non plus"" takes on a new dimension. Gainsbourg, very much like her famous father, is rather homely --certainly no Scarlett Johannson -- consequently her nudity is not particularly arousing, and this is undoubtedly an important subtext of the picture -- yet there are scenes where she radiates a kind of inner beauty when we see a part of her apart from her sexual obsession-- and her overall performance in this film is simply astounding. The amount of physical abuse she had to endure to convey the many facets of her character was certainly no picnic, but aside from that the psychological demands of her ""Joe"" character are such that it is hard to think of any other actress who could have come close. If Charlotte Gainsbourg does not gain an Oscar for her work in this incredible film in 2015 it will only be because blue nose Hollywood Academy voters are not yet ready to take closeups of human sex organs seriously. The very first scene of this remarkable film shows us a naked woman stimulating her clitoris in hairy pubic closeup. Already in the first minute of the picture a mainstream film Taboo is shattered, and, like it or not, Nymphomaniac IS a mainstream film, with mainstream names such as Uma Thurman, Willem de Foe (spellbinding in a single scene) and Shia Laboeuf, how could it be classified as anything else? -- but part of the artistic thrust of this picture is precisely to make us face our ridiculous taboos and the hypocrisy inherent in an industry where vicious bloody murder and severed limbs is acceptable but showing the complete inventory of human anatomy is a no-no. Nymphomaniac is Von Trier's ultimate statements as a film Auteur and will undoubtedly go down as a landmark paradigm changer in mainstream cinema history even if it turns out to be too much for Hollywood to handle at Oscar time. In my book it should be Best Actress for Charlotte Gainsbourg, best supporting actor for Stellan Skarsgard, and Best director for Lars Von Trier -- And that's my ruling -- Judge Roy Beane, Venice, Italy.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
55,AJ4F,It keeps your attention but the women are unappealing,6,18 March 2020,"This review technically covers volume 1 as well, since it's all the same story.The first thing I noticed was how bony, mole-covered and unappealing the younger Joe is, and her older counterpart isn't much better (plus less shapely in certain places). Were these actresses chosen to not make it all about ""hot babes"" and more of a psychological study? That's no small point, since the plot hinges on men wanting to quickly bed these gaunt apparitions, and it didn't ring true.The men were portrayed as lust robots with no real discretion, doing the male reputation no favors! Lack of any real discussion about VD and protected sex was also odd. I was surprised at the level of nudity without an X-rating, and watched both films on a whim after seeing them on a free streaming site.But the intellectual narrative of Seligman worked as a good contrast to the women's sleazy deeds and manipulation of men. That's mostly what kept it interesting for me.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
56,SimonD1900,The tabu of sex,9,10 April 2021,"Sex is tabu, something shameful. At the same time we praise it and obbses over it. It's all most want to talk about, and do talk about, yet there is so much *hush hush* about it at the same time. We love it and we fear it. It's both extacy and it's also pain. It's such a double edge sword. Yet, in reality, it's one of the most common and fundamental parts of human nature and what we are. It's actually mondane. Still, we make such a big fuss over it.I think Trier tries to tackle this ambivalent complexities we have about sex, also the fact that we humans function sexually in very different ways, in this very long two part film. Personally, I think he did a good job. I do understand if many hate it though and I wouldn't blame them.And I would like to add, if you enjoy this movie. I would recommend the directors cut version.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

58,o_s_k_r,meh,4,21 July 2014,"There's a good number of people raving about this film and just as many hating on it. (In fact it looks like there's a heap of fake reviews here rating the film as 1/10).Firstly this is an ART film. If you don't like ART films don't watch it.Secondly this is a film that purposely challenges the audience. The director is not really aiming for entertainment here.This is a film called ""Nymphomania"" but it's not really about that at all. I was expecting to see a woman destroyed by her sexuality. On the contrary she seems to be suffering from common garden ""depression"" and in fact her promiscuous lifestyle is just fine. In the ENTIRE MOVIE there is only one scene where her sexuality is a source of genuine conflict - the Uma Thurman scene (definitely the highlight of this film). Otherwise it's only her anti-social and depressive behaviour that causes her problems. I consider the narrative a huge failure actually, because the subject of nymphomania is very interesting - I was disappointed the director chose not to explore it properly.Then there's a couple of sections that are totally contrived. The debt-collecting bit felt implausible and weird. The S&M scenes felt very much off-topic. The protagonist just didn't feel real to me. I understand that she is telling a story (to Seligman) and that it's implied she's not being completely factual. But why do a film like that? Von Trier constantly eschews interesting possibilities, simply to purposely bore the audience (there's a lot of fast-forwarding to be done here).The final scene in the movie is one of the dumbest. Seligman comes on to Gainsbourg (some people have construed this as attempted rape but to me he was just a hopeless old virgin). Gainsbourg then shoots the man. The screen goes black before we hear the shot which possibly implies that Gainsbourg has already ""died inside"". Why? Nothing in the movie thus far has suggested that her sexuality is a genuine problem. Why has she suddenly decided that it is wrong? It's nice to have an unexpected ending but it destroys whatever meaning the audience may have constructed thus far.I'm not going to deny that this film is ART. However art can be sh*t. And this is SH*T ART. Sorry Von Trier. I like to be entertained. I like to see a cohesive film. This felt like watching a TURD.Note that I reviewed both parts as one film.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

But after watching this one I can't help saying what a movie! I actually watched the uncut version which is 3 hours long. I pitty those who got this movie just as a ""sex film"". You will only understand this film if you've some experiences same as the main character. I'm myself a sex addict and I'm too much into categories like BDSM and humiliating sex which other people think is stupid and laugh on. I'm also experiencing sexual weakness and frustration lately which I haven't told anybody about yet. Though I'm not in too miserable condition and I'm confident I'll be okay till the time of my marriage, but this film showed the world what people like us feel which no one seems to understand. Psychological sickness is real people and it's different in everyone's case. And you have to experience that sickness yourself in order to understand it. That's the reason why the critics didn't liked this movie. But for me, I LOVED IT! Great acting, beautifully made witch peacefull atmosphere.

62,jjturley,Long and Rambling,2,30 January 2015,"When Lars von Trier finished his rambling speech at the Cannes Film Festival in 2011 (in which he claimed to be a Nazi) I recall feeling bewildered and disgusted. Likewise with his two ""Nymphomaniac"" movies, I am left with the same feelings.This review covers both movies: We are introduced to a self-proclaimed nymphomaniac named Joe (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg), who, based on her condition makes choices in her life and causes drama to follow. Everything is related in chronological chapters. She reveals all of this to a man named Seligman (played by Stellan Skarsgård).The sexual scenes are not erotic at all. This must be intentional? Whether intended or not, some scenes just drag on for too long. There are number theory references, literary references, and a little Mozart and Franck thrown in as well. Talk about pretentious! The viewers are supposed to believe that they are watching something arty and intelligent, and thus might feel less turned off...Lars von Trier could have made the same story but used a different medical condition. Why not have a person who suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome? Said person could then relate their life story around all the times that they suddenly needed to use a toilet and couldn't find one! I am sure there would be lots of drama there too; and it would be about as interesting to watch.I am giving this movie a ""2"" since I liked looking at the trees. There were many shots of them throughout the movie, and they were nice to look at.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
63,thao,A magnificent film which takes its subject matter very seriously,9,30 January 2014,"This review is for both parts.One gets the feeling that Trier is out to make the definitive sex drama, and maybe even his own magnum opus. In it he touches on almost every form of sexual desires and deviations, and does so in an honest and explicit way. A lot of these themes are investigated in the light of religion and psychology with refreshing and provocative ideas thrown into the mix. This is a huge film. Not only because it is long but also because it tackles a huge subject and takes its time to investigate each one of them.I saw the 4 hour short version of the films (it is actually two films, each with end credits and separate names) and even though 4 hours is more than enough time for most films it never felt too long. If anything I felt that the 2nd film could have used more time to develop relationships. It felt a little rushed. So I'm quite sure that the film needs the extra 1 and 1/2 hour we get with the directors cut. The films open with a text saying that this is a ""censored"" and shortened version of Trier's film, made with his consent but not with his involvement. I believe Trier has not even seen these versions. You can tell that they have been censored. Even though you see genitals in close up they usually cut to faces during intercourse. There are some explicit oral sex scenes (for both men and women) and men are shown getting aroused. So the film does push the envelope but not as much as some had expected. It has been hard getting the film shown in some countries so maybe censoring was the right move. Otherwise it might have gone straight to DVD and Blu Ray. So is it porn? It has scenes that could have been lifted from a porn film but the focus is never on sexual scenes to get the audience aroused, but rather on the story, so I don't agree with those who call this film porn. The sex scenes serve the story perfectly unlike in porn films where the story serves the sex scenes.There are a lot of references to Antichrist here. It has the two main actors in the film. Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) believes she is evil and refers to many religious ideas and imagery to support it (the dangerous evil woman) and there is even a scene from Antichrist with the same music. These films are also an homage to Tarkovsky (like Antichrist was). The first film opens with a borrowed shot from Solaris (maybe because this is going to be the same kind of inner journey). The 2nd part opens with a levitation scene, not unlike the one we see in The Mirror and one of the chapters in the film is even called The Mirror.I loved the use of music in the film. We get everything from heavy metal to Talking Heads to Bach, with often detailed information about these music masterpieces. It kind of reminded me of the way Lynch uses music in Lost Highway. One can even say that the opening is a homage to that film (where the camera goes into darkness and comes out again).It goes without saying that the main theme of the film is sex but it is far from being the only theme. There is a lot of religious and psychological themes throughout the film, and the film takes its time to explain art, fly fishing and what not.I know I have not said anything about the story. I think it is best to go in not knowing. Let's just say that this is an odyssey of a Nympomaniac and she goes to a lot of places on her journey from a 7 year old to a grown up woman (there are 3 actresses that play her throughout these stages of her life).As always in a Trier film, the film is extremely well acted. It is often self conscious, both in its style and acting. Trier even writes on the film, both numbers and words, and one of the characters in the film explains historical facts to Charlotte Gainsbourg but Trier never hides the fact that these explanations are really there for the audience and maybe even more so for himself as a narrative way into the story.SPOILERS! Regarding the end of the film. Some might take it as a silly, almost Twilight Zone way of ending the film. I think it fits well with the previous Freud themes discussed. Freud said that suppressing sexual desires (the ID) was unhealthy, and would lead to psychological problems in the end. So the end could be tied into that. But it could also be seen as a confirmation of what Charlotte Gainsbourg's character said all along. She was evil (ala Antichrist), but the man did not takes her warnings seriously and payed the price for that. Maybe I'm just trying to explain away the strangeness of the ending, because it does feel strange. END OF SPOILERS.I think this is a magnificent film which takes its subject matter very seriously. It is among Trier's best films and it might even be his magnum opus in the uncut version. It is beautiful to look at and definitely a film you want to see at the cinema, even in its shorter version.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
64,thomasshahbaz,Misleading tagline,4,25 June 2014,"This whole ""forget about love"" thing is very misleading, as I found love to be a central, recurring theme, and certainly something which the main character experiences in all of its various forms. Just like in the first volume, the sex (or violence as it has now become) is minimal and not pornographic.It almost feels as if Von Trier has tried to remake Antichrist, or perhaps ""remix"" it, as the main character shares many traits and the film many themes therewith, not least of all the use of the scene comprising a toddler making for an open window with snow falling while the mother is too busy getting her kicks elsewhere. Whatever Von Trier was trying to do with this film was, in my opinion, unsuccessful, resulting in a garbled, bizarre mesh of moments of brilliance and eye-rolling farce. As with many of his films, the set pieces all look so similar as to make you wonder if it was all shot in the same building.The characters speak in a manner which is contrived and literary to the point of impenetrability in some parts, but not insofar as to add anything worthwhile to proceedings. The thing that most impressed me was how this addressed the nature of addiction, sexuality and personality.The ending is as pointless, superfluous, stupid as the hand coming out of the water at the end of Deliverance.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
65,ricardopthomaz,Good conclusion!,8,24 March 2014,"Finally I saw Lars Von Trier's conclusion to the final segment of his depression trilogy, Nymphomaniac Vol. II.""Can't wait to see Vol. II coming out on March! Jesus, pardon my pun, but my brain just had an orgasm!"" Those were my own words about Vol. I that you can see in my review of the movie here on the site. As for Vol. II...Who is genuinely pure and inviolable? And who wouldn't commit a sin under the right circumstances, seeking for self-satisfaction? Who wouldn't fall over the world's pressure and endless promises of pleasure having the right stimulus? How much would you take before finally descend into the abyss? Are you really what you tell people you are? Those and many other issues, including the saga of a really depressive woman that can't stop making out are questioned in this 4 hour saga.Today I just saw Vol. II, and I must say I was eager to see it considering how great was the first one. Can't say I was overwhelmed, once that I found this Vol. II a little weaker than the first Volume, but nevertheless, it was good and truly engaging. As all the other Trier's movies, this one also find its strenght in clever storytelling and controversy. The audacity of this piece was really something that deserves attention.As it was labeled Vol. II, I'll give a grade for this alone, it's 8, considering how much I enjoyed the previous one giving it a 9. I thought that second volume lacked some things that made the first volume so great, and in the ending credits, I really think that Trier should've played the Rammstein song again instead of that washed up version of Hey Joe, you know, it would be a perfect fit for an ending. But despite that, it was an honorable conclusion, in the very words of our late Roger Ebert. It was a punctual movie, and it had one or other final surprises like Beethoven, considering we had Bach in Vol. I, but still, the philosophical talk was kinda weaker. The real surprises in this second part of the story lie in the plot twists, very well thought and I'd like to highlight the final scene that was just unexpected and it blew me out of the water! But I would be very rude not to consider Vol. I and II together, as they were initially intended to be a 4 hour piece, so I'll give the entire Nymphomaniac experience a solid 8,5. It was an intense, thought provoking and very brave and unique experience with a mind-blowing finale. If you lost Vol. I, wait until you manage to watch it and then, watch both Volumes together as one single movie. It's mostly recommended!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
66,jcnsoflorida,An Interesting Provocation,7,24 July 2014,"I haven't seen all of Von Trier's films. 'Melancholia' is probably the most accessible (and my favorite, so far). Nympho Vols I & II are not must-sees, but worth seeing. I have a mild preference for Vol. II mainly because Stacy Martin isn't in it much. The 'Joe' character is played mostly by Charlotte G in Vol. II, so fans of CG might share my preference. Viewers of so-called art films often think like they're not supposed to find humor in them. Nympho challenges that notion. In my view there is some humor in this film, most of it intentional. There is also joy in experimentation. Could be that's one of the things that makes it an art film.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

I've never felt more betrayed by an ending before but NYMPHOMANIAC VOL.II has succeeded so.VOL.II picks up right where we left off with Joe's story.Now I'll try to avoid spoilers as much as possible in case you haven't seen the first part,so to summarize the plot of part 2 I'll just say that this time around we delve into darker,grimmer and incredibly disturbing moments into the main character's (Joe) life.Now that she's grown older,her sex life has become boring so Joe starts to turn to techniques that make the FIFTY SHADES OF GRAY trailer look like a promo for an ABC FAMILY sitcom.Meanwhile we still get the moments of conversation between Joe and Seligman that continue to the end of the movie and thus brings the biggest BITCH SLAP of an ending I've ever seen.Please check out my full review for NYMPHOMANIAC VOL.2 on my Tumblr, link to that is in my InstaBio.

I group this with Volume 1 and say that most of the acting is pretty freaking amazing. Christian Slater's portrayal of Joe's father in the Hospital? It was chilling because it seemed so realistic. I've been bed side to that event...I know what it looks like. The calm at times...and uncontrolled panic the next.I had a feeling the ending may have been what it was. I have to not say too much but; it did wrap it up with a tragic irony.The movie draws upon advanced concepts within music, religion and art to converse at a brilliant level about metaphor transferable between each and how it relates to the story being told. Genius.There is some very graphic sexuality though I wouldn't consider it pornographic but more there for dramatic impact.

69,temrok9,part two,4,15 February 2014,"Two days before I was raving about Nymphomaniac I, as I found it funny, poetic, exciting, complex and meaningful in a fresh way.Now that I've watched the much anticipated second part it is as if I have to deal with another movie, one that has turned all the good things of the first part into bad.Things get serious and they get boring;Trier remembers his ever-moving camera tricks;dialogs begin to show that they want to point to something important, and we are forced to believe we are watching a drama, the drama of a suffering individual;the greatness of the modern first part is lost and the attack to eroticism is obvious, as the focus of the movie seems to be on the impotence rather than sexuality(or is this the border which sexuality eventually reaches?).All these having been told, the movie is not totally pointless;there is a subtle confrontation of the shallowness of the cognitive-behavior model versus the self-fulfilling vision of psychoanalysis, as a way of rediscovering oneself through narration;and there is a defense of the individual myth of everyone of us, giving sexuality the importance that has lately been neglected.But even so, Trier prefers the show and ends the movie with a narrative twist that seems to aim only at creating impressions.Anyway, I found it a pity it all ended that way and I keep wondering whether I was fooled into believing there was something great here in the first place.After all, it's one movie, not two, isn't that so?and judging it as one, I conclude that I find it interesting but not superb as I thought first.I keep preferring his early movies.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
70,mariammansuryan,Still don't know!,5,19 August 2018,"As I said in my review of Nymphomaniac Vol. 1, I really don't know. In this volume some new sexual aspects add up to the woman's life, like sadomasochism and therapy (followed by setting someone's car on fire). I really do want to believe that Lars does not just use these techniques to capture every horny viewer's attention and keep them hooked to the TV.The good parts for me were the dialogues between the nymphomaniac girl and the asexual man. His comparisons are sometimes quite interesting and give a bit more depth to the film (although artificially in some parts, especially at the end) to the film. What I liked is that through the asexual character, Lars is helping the audience understand the nymphomaniac (as compared to her probably most of us would be asexual). As if he is saying that you don't even have to have sex to be able to understand her, just think of parallels with stains on your walls or your fishing hook with her story of uncontrollable sex. He's basically saying that everyone can understand everyone if they really wish to.Okay, now I'll put this without spoilers, the end shook me in a way I didn't expect. I mean, I did realize that the characters would change somehow by the end 6 hours of the film, but could not foresee what happened. It was quite gross honestly. At first I hated the ending, however gradually I realized that the fear of me thinking ""oh the movie should end soon~"", but the scene of the door remaining on my screen was quite powerful. And this crippling spiders went into my body saying ""whoops, something's not quite as I expected..."". So I have to say, that was powerful, at least some time after digesting this film.Thanks Trier, I gave this 5 stars because that was my gut reaction, but I don't think you'd care, so I won't change it.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
71,ybredad,Great ending.,8,2 November 2014,"I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars just because of the ending. For the most part, it was a bit on the boring side. Perhaps it was my love of movies, or it may have been the director's skill at keeping us hooked through not 1 but two volumes of this story that kept me along for the ride. There were a few things I thought made the movie uneven, i.e. the character change, especially for Joe and Jerome during their older years. I understand why it was done the way it was, but watching Jerome as Jerome until he wasn't at the end, a most crucial part of the film, vented the emotion we could have felt for Joe when she opts to pull the trigger. I could go on.Without the ending, this would have gotten a 4.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
72,forlornnesssickness,Nymphomaniac: Vol. II .and her therapy will end.,5,14 June 2014,"Now we arrive at ""Nymphomaniac: Vol. II"", the second part of Lars von Trier's another challenging work to talk and discuss about. As its exhausted heroine warned us previously, this is a darker territory compared to its first part which was relatively playful at times despite its uncomfortable subject. While the conversation between her and a man intrigued by her wild, tormented sex life is continued as before, we finally see how she went through downward spiral and then eventually hit the bottom, and that is certainly not a very cheerful sight to observe – and we are less amused here as a consequence.As described in ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"", young Joe(Stacy Martin) had sex with many men as boldly pursuing the orgasm she experienced for the first time when she was just a little girl. At the beginning of ""Nymphomaniac Vol. II"", older Joe(Charlotte Gainsbourg) describes that precious moment of carnal ecstasy during one sunny afternoon, and Seligman(Stellan Skarsgård), who has attentively and actively listened to her life story throughout the previous film, promptly interprets her experience as a fascinatingly unholy version of religious experience. In contrast to Jesus surrounded by two holy spirits, she was surrounded by Valeria Messalina and the Whore of Babylon, two notorious evil women of lust. Does it mean that she was preordained to her own twisted martyrdom?At the end of ""Nymphomaniac Vol. I"", Joe reunited with Jerôme(Shia LaBeouf) and then reached to the peak of her sex life as having another sex with him. She was happy at first, but that was the beginning of her downturn. She soon finds that she no longer feels pleasure from sex because her private part suddenly begins to feel numb. She tries a very naughty prank with several spoons when she and Jerôme are having a meal at a restaurant(Udo Kier briefly appears as a waiter during that scene), but that is still not enough for her, and she naturally becomes frustrated.With Jerôme's encouragement, Joe tries to find a way to regain her pleasure while maintaining her housewife live with her young son(now she is played by Gainsbourg from this point). At one point, she spots a guy among a group of African immigrant workers on the street, and then she finds herself being between him and the other African guy who comes along with him to a hotel room where she was waiting for him. In the previous film, we were served with the montage of various photos of male genitalia, and now we are served with a rather amusing shot of Gainsbourg surrounded by two black erected penises here in this film, which look like arguing with each other as much as their owners who suddenly begin to argue with each other when they and Joe are trying to have a sex. Whatever you think of this explicit sequence, it is surely something we do not see everyday.And then she is introduced to a perverted sex therapy service run by a courteous guy who is also quite brutal whenever he begins his sadomasochistic job on his female client, and she finds herself getting addicted to this as going through several experiences both humiliating and painful. Like many cases of addicts, she always gets what she wants in the end, and pain and humiliation mean almost nothing to her whenever she feels satisfied. With Gainsbourg ready to endure any inconvenience to be inflicted upon her, Jamie Bell gives a chillingly compelling performance as her sadistic service guy, and their disturbing scenes are effectively presented in the stark background while Seligman observes how Joe's ordeals can be compared to the sufferings of the Christ.As she is going for more and more, her life is accordingly disrupted and destroyed. Jerôme, still played by LaBeouf even at this point, finally leaves her, and she loses her son as a result, and then she is ordered to attend sex addict meeting. When she is advised to get rid of anything to remind her of sex, she instantly sets herself on that task, but her attempt only shows how her life is barren and lonely when devoid of anything sexual.That point resonates with an earlier scene in which Seligman confesses to her that he is an asexual virgin. Like Joe has been filling her life with orgasmic sensation, he has been stuffing his life with books, and that is probably the reason why he remains to be calm and detached while listening to her story packed with many lurid details. He looks intrigued as pensively analyzing her history of sexual activities as her amateur analyst, and he is also horrified by Joe's downward spiral, but does he really understand her at all?After finally concluding that she can accept her nymphomania as a part of who she is, Joe walks out of her sex addict meeting and then delves into crime. She begins to work as debt collector for a loan shark played by Willem Dafoe, and it turns out that her sexual experience is useful for her new occupation; in case of one 'client' played by Jean-Marc Barr, Joe smartly exposes his deep secret like a wily interrogator, and, after finishing her business to do, she give some, uh, reward to this humiliated guy she comes to pity despite his disgusting sexuality.There is a bleakly beautiful scene showing Joe and a crooked tree alone in the gray landscape, and I think that tells a lot about what von Trier tries to express through his uneven but compelling story. Some of us are drawn to the dark pit of empty loneliness as driven and tormented by their destructive impulses, and we may not help them at all from the start, but, as fellow human beings, maybe we can understand them at least while learning more about what makes us tick in such miserable ways sometimes.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
73,victuki,Nice Try Von Trier,6,27 August 2014,"In this Volume II, the sexual saga of Joe goes on. Imagine we just have had a 5 minutes break, and then we resume the story of Joe and her fantastic tale, a fascinating one for Seligman. Now, the adult version of Joe takes it from here in the narration; we witness how she goes through processes, new tastes and even a slight physical crisis, all of them filtered by her addiction. Joe has matured now, she has become a functional addict, even using her set of skills in a given profession (not that one!). Her new patron (Willem Dafoe) will use those skills, and eventually will persuade Joe to shelter and take care of a troublesome young girl in order to be her heir. That unexpected and ""human"" action for Joe will trigger some intense events that will lead us to the end of this journey. Volume I was the novelty, all about the fuss. The tone does not change that much in this volume, yet the character does. Give voice to your thoughts and these will strike you as different, sound different. That is what eventually happens to Joe, since she has been speaking things that had never been outside her mind. And that changes both Joe and Seligman. This is not a spoiler, but Von Trier is just telling a story about human beings. With no artificial or social boundaries, we are animals, no matter how civilized or evolved we think we are. It is action-reaction, but for humans, most of the times is about action-instinct. That's what we all are, and Von Trier show that.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
74,FrostyChud,Portrait of a failed psychoanalysis,10,30 January 2014,"NYMPHOMANIAC is the most exciting, intelligent film I have seen in a long time. The moment I saw Seligmann shuffle out of his apartment to Rammstein, I knew I was in the hands of a filmmaker I could trust. This scene was the first of many at which I found myself exulting inside. GO, LARS, GO! NYMPHOMANIAC is von Trier's F-14 and he takes it on bombing run after bombing run, destroying a different pious hypocrisy each time. The film is full of all sorts of audacious touches that no other filmmakers working today have the guts or brains to include in their boring, sentimental, ideological films. NYMPHOMANIAC is also very funny. What I liked best about NYMPHOMANIAC was its total refusal of the consolations of ideology. Sexuality is presented truthfully, which is to say, as something which simply cannot be integrated into the smooth social order without one or the other being damaged. No one in the movie has a ""healthy"" sexuality. In a certain sense, the nymphomaniac herself is the closest thing to a healthy person in that she refuses to adhere to any of the hypocritical moral orders represented by the other characters, from conformism to abstinence to impotent cognitive-behavioral therapy to S&M to crime and so on. She is a stain no matter where she goes and in this sense she incarnates the truth, which also has the status of a permanent stain. At the same time that von Trier does everything right, he gets everything wrong, but in the best possible way. NYMPHOMANIAC reminded me of the book that OJ Simpson wrote in which he describes how he would have killed Nicole and Ron ""if he had done it"". What OJ wrote is a confession in scare quotes, one in which every detail is present except the most important one, namely, the actual acknowledgment of guilt. NYMPHOMANIAC has the same structure, although instead of being the story of a murder, it is the story of a psychoanalysis. A troubled person on a bed is encouraged to speak to a learned, wise, benevolently neutral man who is sitting next to the bed. She is encouraged to tell her whole story. He will refuse judgment and simply listen. Over the course of a psychoanalysis, patterns and unlikely coincidences slowly take shape and are spotted by the analysand, who eventually comes to recognize them at their true value, namely as the traces of an emergent repressed discourse. Lars von Trier has brilliantly condensed and rendered this process by making Joe's story full of improbable coincidences. How much of this really happened and how much of it is a delusion? Could she really have run into Jerome so many times? Could she really have had a vision of the Whore of Babylon as a pubescent girl? Etc. The sex life of Joe starts and ends with the exact same scenario: 3+5=8. This circularity is also characteristic of the psychoanalytic process. An analysis reaches its conclusion when the analysand recognizes that she has done nothing but repeat, again and again, her own contingent, sexualized unconscious interpretation of a traumatic encounter. By superimposing this sum on the screen, von Trier condenses and renders visible the fundamentally signifying, even meaningless kernel of the compulsion to repeat trauma that Freud called the death drive. Joe's analysis comes to an end when she is able to witness how insubstantial and senseless her compulsion is. All tied up, right? And then Seligmann tries to have sex with Joe! At this moment everything crumbles. The moment he whips it out, Seligmann invalidates the nascent story that has begun to emerge from between the lines of her official story. The fragile consistency of this new liberating interpretation of Joe's story is entirely dependent on Joe's confidence in Seligmann's ability to see clearly where she can only dimly intuit. His actions prove to her retroactively that he heard nothing but her symptomatic demand to be used, and in so doing he symbolically annuls her true desire.Such an ending is a logical necessity in that Seligmann's ""asexuality"" is completely hypocritical, as is Joe's decision to renounce her sexuality. Here we see why a psychoanalyst must go through analysis himself: if he does not, he can only validate the patient's resistances. Since Seligmann has not integrated his own sexual drives, he is incapable of leading Joe to such an integration. All he can do is lead Joe to his own failed neurotic solution: a refusal of sexuality. But Joe incarnates the intractable stain of truth, which is also the stain of sexuality, and as such she necessarily explodes Seligmann's hypocrisy.It all holds together. Where von Trier gets it all wrong is in his implicit condemnation of psychoanalysis. Here von Trier is properly perverse. His entire movie is a truthful ""confession"" and then, like OJ, he winks and tells us that it was all hypothetical. This last act of resistance invalidates everything that came before it, conveniently rendering the exercise sterile and allowing Joe/von Trier to continue ignoring the truth and enjoying their symptoms. In Joe's case, the symptom is nymphomania. In von Trier's case, the symptom is his gratuitous melancholia, his nihilism. Were he to take the quotation marks off of his confession, he would risk facing the consequences of his act, namely freedom with all of its attendant complications and miseries. Lars walks us right up to the edge and then fails to take the last decisive step. I do not think that this failure takes anything away from the film. On the contrary, this final gesture transforms the film from a poignant depiction of psychological suffering into a meta-depiction of the attachment to this suffering. This is even a necessity, inasmuch as psychological suffering itself always has, by its very nature, such a double structure.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

And, the blasphemous theme is lost in some sort of unsteady rebellion against societal / cultural oppression of women. This aspect is unsteady because if feels like there is also a certain level of sadistic eroticism where the woman is firmly position as the object of cruelty.All together, it's a really smart, honest and daring look at sexual addiction and dysfunction... then there is this off the rails third act which is completely unnecessary and ridiculous.While it meanders a little after Volume 1, and the plot makes some baffling leaps, it is still electrifying and well worth viewing, particularly when viewed right after part one.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
77,kos-27,depression as a loss of lust,9,19 June 2014,"The Movie Nymphomaniac (of course viewed as one) is the third part of L.v.Triers trilogy about depression. It seems to be the conclusion of the subject.Like his previous enterprises it's a subject that takes him more than one movie to treat. Whereas the first part dealt with questions of the cause and the growth of a depression (Antichrist), the second part dealt with depression itself and its emotional impact (Melancholia). The third part Nymphomaniac shows us the therapy and the possibility of outside help - if at all possible - examining the relation between patient and therapist.This is the background story but not the only subject because the patient Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) has a problem of pressing importance: she considers herself a nymphomaniac.L.v.Trier always chooses women as his main protagonists to tell his point of view maybe because they are more vulnerable, more outspoken (ready to tell their story) and more honest.As to what Nymphomania stands for in the movie I'm not quite sure: Among others it can stand for the lust for life and the uncompromising desire to live life at its fullest without having to sacrifice or be deprived of anything. The subject itself is fascinating especially since Eros (life) is the opposite of Thanatos (death). A third aspect (first being the structure – therapy, second the problem of Nymphomania as a desire for life) is how to handle Nymphomania visually and create a growing and believable story out of it.L.v.Trier decides to unroll it like a lifetime confession illustrating the discovery of lust, the quest for it, the guilt of possessing it, the loss of it and the painful way of regaining it with all its consequences - if you take it as a metaphor for life itself.A big part of transposing his view of life into the Nymphomania story has of course to do with L.v.Triers constant need for provocation, for taking the viewer (society) out of their comfort zone and confronting them with their own prudery and shame but at the same time using his special kind of humor – in fact this movie is actually very funny even in its bleakest moments.He uses his immense knowledge and education (philosophy, literature, music, art) and puts words in the mouths of his main protagonists that could be his, quoting even his former movies.Interesting is that even though he as a former patient (suffering from depression) sees himself as a part of the therapist as well but at the same time makes sure that we accept the impossibility of the two understanding each other. The end makes that absolutely clear revealing the biggest problem: how to unite two opposites - man and woman, patient and therapist, saint and sinner.The movie is visually daring and obscene but also beautiful. Once you've seen it you cannot stop thinking about it and what it all means. And there is a lot to think about because although it is clear in its main features, there is a lot to discover and to decipher. Some details are probably very personal and will never be interpreted by the viewer to a full satisfaction.Maybe it's not a very comfortable movie. It's a movie with a lot of pornographic elements fueled by L.v.Triers sexual fantasies and it's a very blunt and honest movie and at times a very tender and poetic movie, but it's always an unapologetic movie.Not my favorite by L.v.Trier but among his strongest. To touch my soul completely (not only my mind) one point is missing, but still great: 9 out of 10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
78,tangietangerine,The Gun,7,30 June 2014,"I liked this volume of Nymphomaniac best, since the first one seems to get lost in tiresome artistic efforts. This one gets down to business, no pun intended. People can say anything about Lars Von Trier, but they have to admit he can hold his views very well, he's not afraid of telling a story and having to slowly deconstruct all of our ideals in order to do so, and that's one quality I can admire in filmmakers. It doesn't necessarily mean I have to agree to every view supported by the movie and/or characters. I guess that's one of the reasons why people are so bothered by this movie (besides dealing with the most controversial matter of all time), for example, you don't have to be into S&M to actually enjoy this movie, as it doesn't necessarily mean you're a ""pervert"" if you like it, that'd be a bad case of poor judgment.I think Lars makes a very clear point in showing us this is not ""only a movie"", the sceneries are meant to be artificial (similar to Dogville/Manderlay), and some interpositions like the ""3+5""...everything is done on purpose so that we never forget what we're dealing with here.Anyway, what I really liked about this movie is how it goes a long way just to show us a different side of humanity, a side who's not supposed to have any side at all, says society. Even if it is shocking to see Joe admitting that she is indeed a so-called ""nymphomaniac"" and she loves herself just like that, or watching her bring down society's need for moralization in that great hypocrisy monologue...and especially the scene where she gives a bj to the pedophile because she felt somehow they were alike. I was slightly shocked by all of these scenes, the latter, for sure. But I think it's so great when someone comes along (nevermind Lars' public persona) and tries to show other forms of existence, we may not want to see it, but it's there, crawling in the gutters of morality and the civilized society.Another great question portrayed is brought by Seligman, and I was glad it was brought up as it bothered me throughout the entire film. How Joe's (what an ironic name, too) behavior would be treated if she was a man? Because what we have to consider in matters like this is if that behavior is causing pain to the person in question, and what people saw in Joe was a woman threatening the social order of gender. By saying this, I'm not saying there aren't any men who are judged, in some level, by a sex addiction, although it's surely seen differently. And, of course, solely for being a woman, her burden was heavier, she was even more guilty of having abandoned her family to pursue new forms of pleasure, and she ""got what she deserved"" in the end. About the end, I confess I was a little puzzled as to what Lars really was trying to tell us by Seligman's behavior, if anything. I got the feeling it was another irony...after building such a strong argument against society and the human condition itself, I couldn't see how Joe and Seligman would end up redeemed.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
79,wmennisny-617-254276,Just when I thought it couldn't get worse after Vol 1...,2,9 January 2016,"I'm going to keep it straight to the point. Just when I thought, after vol. 1 that it couldn't get worse, along comes the nadir of blackness and utter hopelessness. I know Von Triers from ""Dancer In The Dark"", a film that I liked but found nearly unbearable to watch and only saw once and never want to see again. I recognize the talent, however, and braced myself for another helping. Little did I know what I was really in for. The bottom line is that these films depict a world inhabited by people that are desperately and hopelessly doomed. I've never seen such nihilistic portrayals in my life. I'm all for ""realism"" in films but I don't want to be thrown into the ""real lives"" of these people....no, no a thousand times no! Their world is so bleak and hopeless and devoid of any affection or warmth or light that it simply looses any sense to it. The lives of these people have not an iota of the elements that make living worthwhile so once that's realized, after about a minute, it becomes pure torture. I pride myself on my level of tolerance for the fetishes and idiosyncrasies that people have but sheer brutality is something that I know exists but care not to be thrown into in brutal graphic detail. These are the most bleak and depressing films ever made to my knowledge.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
80,peacecreep,A Wild Epic Journey Into Hell.,10,7 March 2014,"All the one star reviews on this website that are calling the film a ""porn documentary"" are obviously written by a group of religious nuts offended by intellectualism and sexuality. Ignore them.Von Trier has crafted what may be his magnum opus. He goes further into his often explored themes of suffering, femininity and the breaking of social norms. Indeed, this may be one of the most intense inquisitions into the female mind ever put to film. And it has a refreshingly feminist, sex positive tonal undercurrent. The drama really gets going in the second volume which I enjoyed much more than the first. Incredible acting from all involved but Jamie Bell, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Uma Thurman especially. For anyone cultured there is nothing outrageous or controversial here, just a solid thought provoking film from a master of the art form.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
81,wijajo-72563,Watch the film for the right reasons...,8,25 April 2018,"A lot of user reviews mention that it doesn't live up to the ""controversy"". Watching a film because it is hyped up will always leave you feeling disappointed due to the insane or incorrect expectations that you had. This film is not sexy or erotic, it is a long discussion about morality and whether circumstances can justify behaviour. Along the way, the film fearlessly touches upon many controversial subjects. It travels from addiction to abortion to paedophilia in a very short time and covers many more subjects too. The film manages to be informative about subjects whilst also debating the subjects and offering a philosophical viewpoint from the two ideology-different characters.If you wish to view a narrative of life that touches upon some important, controversial and little talked about subjects then watch it. Otherwise, avoid it.I would have given the film a 9 if it wasn't for an ending that was inconsistent with the rest of the film.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
82,alice-enland,Hard to choose between the 2 and the 3,3,19 May 2019,"This is a review of both part
s. 1 is better than 2. 1 actually has a cohesive story and the plot develops along a linear track. Sure there is sex but people are having fun. Also 1 has Uma Thurmond in it and Wow if there was really any reason to see this flick it would be her performance during her 1 scene. Part 2 degenerates to the point of nausea. And the ending is more unforeseen, out of character and unnecessary.The woman, Joe, says she is a nymphomaniac. I am sure they exist. She is very close to her father (her mother is as distant as Jupiter). When the movie begins Joe is rescued after enduing a beating in a slummy looking alley. She refuses kindhearted offers of an ambulance or a hospital and instead goes home with the man to get some tea and cake.For some reason that slipped by me, this begins an all-nighter of Joe regurgitating her life story as a nympho. Throughout the narrative, the man (forgot is screen name) buts in an offers some insight into classical music, fly fishing and religion.Did you catch any clues? The little girl has a distant mother and a doting father so she gravitates to sex as a way to attract men. Add to that a good dose of no doubt being aware that there is little or no romantic relationship between her father and mum who she calls a cold b----. Next clue, the girl is named ""Joe."" Next, the first thing the Man digresses into is a speech about fly fishing. Fly fishing? Isn't that a description of what women like Joe do?Who is this Man? We never know what he does but he is smart, well spoken and clearly a recipietn of a classical education. Also, though he be 50 to 60, he is a virgin. So? I think he is a defrocked priest, kicked out for some indescretion.So, a nympho spends the night telling an ex priest about her lifetime of sexual experiences. Althugh the is no doubt a woman, the acresses who play Joe (and the actress who plays Joe's wannabe protege in 2) basically have the frames and figures of boys. Hmmmmmmmm. More gender confusion.

83,SvetoslavGrigorov,Big Movie,10,12 March 2014,"Nymphomaniac Vol I and II. I have done good with not reading any comments, reviews and opinions. It is a long movie - over 4 hours (and if we talk about the uncut versions it could go up to 5 hours) if you watch both of the parts together. It is something extraordinary, explicit and crossing the boundaries if you are both prepared and not prepared.It could be repulsive because it touches other human beings including yourself. It opens wounds and asks questions but does not give you any answers. You cannot be just a viewer while watching it, you are caught in the act along with her. Charlotte Gainsbourg. It is not a porn movie as you would think that it is. You would love it to be porn because it could be easily assimilated, absorbed but IT IS NOT. It is a life sentence for the main character. It is a study of depicting this character and in that sense it is a movie telling her story, fictional or non-fictional,true or not.The story is divided into chapters, the parts of her life. The film is well-balanced between both of the protagonists: Gainsbourg and Skarsgård. They are the both sides of the human equation.They are the plus and minus, the devil and the saint, the whore and the monk.You cannot expect mediocre/in-between/golden medium from Trier because he is non of those. Trier deals with extremes and if it involves gore, penises, v..s, death, masochism, sadism,homosexuality, suicidal tendencies, and even paedophilia as part of the the spectrum of the human sexuality you have to accept it because if you do not you do not accept the life and the surrounding reality.And hey, let's not forget:it's not a propaganda, it's just someone's story,take it or leave it. The actors are what they should be:too far from Hollywood and too good to be true but they are so truthful that it could be scary for someone (or taken as porn as mentioned previously).I liked very much the little forgotten Christian Slater. He adds a lyrical tone to the movie and his death strangely contradicted to his (forever) youngish face is an allegory of how we remember the dying people.How the memory filters the presence of the loss and how it deals with it are some of the other questions. The music including Rammstein, Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild, Shostakovich, Cesar Franck , etc. is a precise choice for a movie from 2014- a sentimental journey from point A to point B with ups and downs,enhancing the good photography, poetic language and metaphors. Now with the comparisons. Watching such an extreme movie, as I described it few lines earlier I will not diverge too much but to me it has echoes from Pasolini, The Night Porter, Fassbinder, and maybe a little bit of the early Polanski like The Tenant and Cul-De-Sac. Final note: Lars Von Trier is BIG.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
84,sean73267326,Masterpiece.,9,18 April 2014,"What on earth is wrong with everyone here? Either Mr. Von Trier has made a million IMDb accounts to complain about this film himself as some weird joke (I wouldn't be surprised to be honest), or everyone from the United States has fallen over and smacked their heads. Not to be discrimination, but seriously, almost every bad review has come from the US, which I think should say more about the country than this film if they're genuine.Either way, I think Lars has made his masterpiece with both parts of this film. I can't remember a time when a film has inspired so many emotions in me (even in spite of its inherent flaws, particularly the dreadful Shia LeBeouf); disgust, shock, laughter, sadness. Of course over 4 hours the film has to be more than a one-note samba, and of course it changes its tune more than a few times, between each of the different chapters.As for the hot topic surrounding Nymph()maniac: yes, there is sex. Lots and lots and lots of sex. I'm fairly sure I've never seen a more explicit film, and even if I have this one has all others beat hands in terms of sheer quantity. Not a single moment of any of it is erotic though. There are several funny sexual scenes (such as the failed threesome or Seligman imagining Joe as a teacher), several shocking ones, and many more brutal ones, but not a moment of it is here to please anyone. Don't come to it expecting a porno.Joe, battered and bloody, is found by a kindly older man in an alleyway and taken in. She recounts the experiences leading up to how she got there, from her childhood through teens and through motherhood, and all the sexual experiences and perversions along the way. It sounds like a fairly formulaic idea and yet it works better than it should. There are times watching the film whereby I wondered why it did so beautifully. Perhaps it was the acting; all three actresses portraying Joe are phenomenal, as is Stellan Skarsgård and particularly Uma Thurman in her best role since The Bride. Perhaps, though, it may be the film's vitality. It's bizarre really that a film with a borderline depressing subject matter and so many upsetting scenes feels so alive, and yet is does. Von Trier seems to be celebrating so many things here; filmaking, music, lust, passion, love, femininity, controversy, and ultimately life, in metaphorical form in an absolutely stunning shot in the second volume, or literally by its own audaciousness and carefree playfulness. So many films seem content to lie down and submit to the audience's anxieties and fears at what they might see on the screen; this isn't one of them. Mr. Von Trier, like Joe, has demanded more from the sunset, and it's a blinder.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
85,avzwam,Awful,1,27 May 2014,"Whilst watching Nymphomaniac I found myself often intrigued but when it was over I wondered what I got out of watching it ultimately. It all didn't really go anywhere if you ask me.Why is it a worthwhile experience to watch this film in Lars von Trier's opinion? Why do we need to see this film in which we among other things see mankind more or less at its worst? What is the point of this film which disgusts at times? It also depressed me as it seemed to have quite a grim, defeatist, misanthropic outlook which I found a waste of time to witness. I think the film lacks focus as well as maturity.What disgusted me for instance was the moment towards the end during which the girl relieves herself on top of the female protagonist. What is the point of this, Lars? We already knew the girl was bad news.The fact that there was nudity and sex in the film didn't disgust me in and of itself. I don't have a problem with nudity and sex in films but it has to be there for a good reason and it's like the whole idea behind the film isn't clear; what Lars intended to do with this film is simply beyond me.A one star rating on here stands for ""awful"" and I have no choice but to give it that as I truly do think it is an awful film.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
86,pinkybanana2000,Behind the nudity is a really interesting story,8,3 November 2014,"*****THIS COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS*** I am no movie expert, but after seeing so many ""reviewers"" dismiss this as porno, I felt the need to state my disagreement.First, it is true there is a whole lot of nudity. Short of seeing an X-rated movie, it is not easy to understate the nudity. Some of it seemed gratuitous, but do not underestimate the power of imagery.Second, it is not pornographic. Oh, no. You can tell when a movie is pornographic. As a red-blooded male were you aroused? If the answer is no, then it is not pornographic. At no time was I aroused.Third, there is a really compelling back story. One more relevant and more engrossing than the naked bodies. I suspect that many a viewer could relate to one or more of the characters. And I suspect you were so caught up in the story, you had no time to be aroused.There is some slyness in how the story is told. It is as if von Trier was toying with us. Read the reviews of actual experts and most of them could explain his intentions better than those of us on this board.It is a very easy story to follow: an unusually sexually active female engages in reckless and wanton sex with any and everybody. In the process, she suffers all the emotions, including, but not limited to, anger, jealousy, humiliation, abuse and rejection that was bound to ensue. There is some redemption in the end, it seems. If you can see that, the movie has achieved its aim. By the way, the movie is titled ""Nymphomaniac."" Why should the subject-matter surprise anybody?",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

The acting once again was excellent, and Charlotte Gainsbourg delivered a beautifully complicated and crafted performance. The story started right from where the first volume ended, but this one was missing maybe the surprise factor or the once unknown character development. I did liked that it touched various aspects about her nymphomania, like the ups and downs and moving forward from her sexual discoveries. Also, just her accepting herself and embracing it was a wonderful scene. Moreover, the conclusion to this journey was very gratifying to me, because this was just her telling her story and understanding what her situation was and that she had the control over it.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

90,aero-windwalker,The second half failed apart on storytelling...,7,15 July 2014,"Generally speaking Nymphomaniac is a great movie. It discusses the struggle within the society – that how simultaneously similar and different we are individually (and how we can find such struggle even within ourselves as an individual). It is an intelligent discussion, but also it questions the origin of the similarity and diversity – that we are born to be different (and then we are taught to be the same and different). Knowledge and thoughtful thinking can only help us to understand these differences. At the end, it is simultaneously a celebration and a condolence to the diversity in the differences. The ending, and many might have questioned, is an unsettled highlight of this celebration-condolence. That the two very different kind of people, a nymphomaniac and an asexual, sought to have sex based on curiosity – yet see the activity from two very different side of it. Seligman wanted to experiment sex with Joe because he found it intellectually interesting, and he believed Joe would be the best person to experiment with. He failed to understand that Joe emotionally separated him to the rest of human kind because he was blessed to have no desire for sex (physically). That's why she also emotionally failed to accept the fact that Seligman wanted to have sex with her – and therefore chose to kill herself for it (that she was tired in life and have no will to live after her one and only friend in life went across the line). It's not hard for me to understand this because I have two personalities and I switch between a hyper-sexual individual like Joe and an asexual individual like Seligman. Everything makes sense naturally – and I suspect von Trier has similar symptom like myself. However, to really depict this struggle, it should take further steps in the story telling process (like how first volume took it really slow, but the second volume went too fast - should really be two times longer) for most average people to get what is really going on and what the main discussion was – otherwise it would simply look like some pseudo intelligent piece.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
91,sc-700-363458,"Interesting film, but not everyone's cup of tea.",9,26 April 2016,"First off I have given a high score as I don't think you can really rate a film like this; and many have given this a low score as they don't like the subject matter. This is not a film you can watch without having seen Volume one.It's a film about the extremes of sex, if you haven't an open mind on this subject then don't watch this film. There is a lot of graphic sex in this film, presumably to capture the authenticity of the material. Compared to volume one, the sex is much darker and delves into extreme BDSM. There are some very violent sex scenes, which nearly everyone would find deeply disturbing. However, more disturbing is the subject matter, much of which is not really explained, and pushes the story into strange unlit depths.As a film it is slow, arty, and with considerable metaphors. Intellectual more than passionate. Nicely shot too it has to be said; along with considerable acting and direction. Personally, I find if you don't engage with the principal character, it is hard to really enjoy the film. Although it would be possible to claim that Siligman is the viewpoint character the viewer is meant to empathize with (which too a degree does work). Compared to Volume one, this is definitely the better film. More condensed pace and covers the material with less ""pauses"". Does the film challenge and make you think? Definitely, but it is not an easy experience, even more so than the first film. Plot wise the film does reach a rounded conclusion, but I am not sure the ending will be to everyone's taste either.I liked that the film did not pull any punches and explored adult themes deeply, if not shockingly at times. However I would only recommend this for individuals that have a broad understanding of sexuality, prepared to be subjected to some pretty violent X rated scenes, and are fans of very arty, intellectual theater. As I said at the beginning, his is not the sort of film you can judge, you have to see it and make up your own mind.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
92,k_28,The most anti-erotica movie one can ever see,5,13 August 2014,"There are war movies and there are anti-war movies; similarly despite having lots of nudity , graphic sex and X rated content which one can only find in porn movies ; this is remarkably anti-sexual movie ; which may belong to some genre called as ""anti-erotica"" !!. There is of course nothing wrong in director making a statement against something and showing a disturbing view of sex ; but at times it gets gory , filthy and disgusting and that's what unfortunately keeps floating in your mind after you are finished watching the movie . This reminded me of ""Salo 120 days of sodomy"" - another sick flick , though this is much serious movie. There are scenes of group sex , bondage , as* whipping and you name it. It seems director wanted to outdo Catherine of ""Romance"" in how much viewer can tolerate but where ""Romance"" had a central theme this movie is lost midway just like its characters. So anyone looking to enjoy nudity then this movie is not for you as it will make you feel sick rather than excited (unless you are some pervert!) . But then this claims an art film and not a porn and unfortunately it fails to become a movie and ends up something like a documentary on nymphomania. The story doesn't touch you because its so contrived , long , confusing and self contradictory. At the end you end up with nothing and you don't feel anything for main character either.The Nymphomaniac vol I and II are essentially one movie but if one were to only watch first part probably they will have a better exp. This is a story a depressed girl who becomes sex addict. But like any other addiction , despite having too much of it , one can never get enough of it; so despite having sex 10 times a day she remains unsatisfied and sad. This movie chronicles her sexual experiences and life . It is juxtaposed quite abruptly with philosophy , history and some religious innuendos . The director must be commanded for taking a very difficult subject like depression. You surely cant create a melodrama on such a subject; and he pushed an envelope of viewer at times. But then it seems director loses track of himself and takes it too far like justifying the use of word ""Ne*ro"" and even sympathizing with pedophiles. This is totally unacceptable and at best shameful for director. It is understandably any movie about depression will have a darker tone and disturbing visuals or stroppy but it will have at least some of its moments; coz only then depression is visible as a contrast to something good; this movie completely fails to create any moments between its characters even though its tries hard. The only memorable scene in the movie is claimed not by lead actors but by Uma Thurman in guest appearance.The worse part of movie must be its ending. In fact the whole movie could have been salvaged with a better ending since it had good performances of lead actors and impressive background score . But the ending is stupid , incoherent and incompressible. It ruins whatever is left of it.Despite all this I think this movie can be watched once for trying to understand a very difficult subject of depression. How the depressed person often chooses an easy thing vs tough one i.e. controlling desires vs indulging in desires and then walks down the spiral of destruction and ends up into abyss of self pity and pain. This is acted beautifully and some sequences have amazing cinematography and drives the point of how not to let depression destroy you.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
93,rapidcereb,A Limit Pushing Film (Part I and II Review),7,2 October 2014,"Having been a fan of Lars Von Trier for quite some time, I thought that he had fallen off into the deep end when I saw the poster ads and tagline for this movie. Despite the posters for this movie, it is not one big orgy featuring any stars crazy enough to sign up, as one might of thought.This movie delves into the deep recesses of the human psyche, and features plenty of existential substance throughout, making one ponder the human condition. Of course throughout the entire movie, safe guards are in place in the form of graphic sexuality to separate the children from the adults, then there is ample chit chat to bore the people expecting a porn flick. Those left watching, will be ones who are familiar with all of Triers previous work, and who like very mature, heavy and thought provoking movies.The editing was done in an almost amateur way at a few small parts, more than likely on purpose to give the movie a voyeuristic feeling at times. I could hardly believe the opening song of Part one, which was a heavy rift from Rammstein, a strange choice to be sure, but with thought I suppose it was to fire up some energy for the heavy, 'low key' ride that was to ensue. The majority of the movie is narration of a story, and while some consider it to be boring, aside from maybe a scene and half in part one, I felt the movie moved at a great pace and I did not find myself getting bored or my attention wandering throughout the four hours split between two movies.This movie focuses on several negative aspects, and is reminiscent of Gasper Noels ""Enter the Void"". This being said I felt myself being reminded of the movie ""Salo"" at times, though this movie has a lot more humanity and substance than that.I was quite intrigued in the second part to find a link to one of Triers prior movies, in turn making this movie a possible prequel of sorts. In the end, it appears Von Trier is carrying out some master plan legacy of film. No doubt he is leaps and bounds ahead of his old days with ""The Kingdom"" and ""Dancer in the Dark,"" though ""Dogville"" still remains a personal favourite of mine.A recommended watch to be sure, but clearly not a movie made for the masses. Instead Lars Von Trier has done what he does best, that is, whatever he so chooses to do, despite what anyone else has to say or think. And He is a master in the realm of film because of it.8/10",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
94,kaustubh09,Don't call Nymphomaniac failure or porn if you don't understand it,8,11 December 2014,"Not a film for everyone and not without cinematic flaws either. But ask yourself what are you looking for in a film? The world has made the mistake of calling obscene name to geniuses (D H Lawrence, the most prominent example from the last century) for too long now. I think it is time that we step back and look at why we so vehemently reject something that threatens or disturbs the rosy illusions we have built around and call life.That said, the film falls short of the expectations I had after the trailer and after previous works by Von Trier, especially Melancholia. The film drew me deeply into it but then in the end left me unsatisfied. Such has not been the case with his earlier films. Sex and graphic sexual content has been an integral part of all of Von Trier's films but here he collides with the monster head on. Has he won? I would say no. How good was the attempt? The bravest attempt I have ever seen.Sex is not an easy subject to deal with. It is very easy to decorate it with rosy images and melodious music. Trier manages to avoid that throughout the marathon run of the two films. In fact he has laid bare many many many aspects of sex. Of course these aspects are not for those who love and live rosy sentimentality everyday. On the other hand, the film is not porn either. In fact it is quite a strong shake for those addicted with porn and even sex for that matter. My only problem is with the character of Seligman. He was not despicable enough for the plot of the story. And that somehow ruined what could have been a real A class experience of cinema watching.If you are intrigued by what sex and sexuality means and are in for rather intense drama and characterizations then this here for you is a treat. On the other hand if you are too deep into mainstream cinema (that just keeps on regurgitating old stuff) or are looking for some juicy porn story then search some other pastures. This here is a poignant effort to delve deeply into the darkness of the human soul.And nobody, not even the stupidest of criticizers, can avoid the beauty of metaphors used and the visuals around them.

95,ohthatgigi,Lars chose the worst ending,3,3 April 2014,"Now we come to the second half, the light and brisk tone turned into darkness and intense.The volume II completed itself to a whole encyclopedia of sex, basically it encompass some most hitted genre of pornography, the heartrending yet anticipatory breakup with Shia and her son, the grotesquely sadistic sexual experience(Jamie Bell is a seductive rising star I think he looks extremely authoritative even in a gray sweatshirt), the lesbian trans-generational sexbut I have to say the second half chose the WORST ending. I almost felt Lars's ineptitude of finishing this overly ambitious and kaleidoscopic of nymphomania.IMO the second half succumb to the exotic provocation and contrived completion, and thus lost the integrated genuinity and spontaneity in the film. The group therapy tirade is simply hard for the audience to buy, and to make things even worse, the objective outsider---the asexual erudite first expressly exalted Joe's curious tale to a feminist level, that's like obliterating the whole soul in the film and later tried to break his cherry . It simply does not end well, the second volume substantiates all the criticism, being pretentious and far-stretched. The beauty of loneliness and individual choice and more political-oriented feminism falters at the last 20 mins of the film. It could have stroked audience with Joe's poetic simplicity in her life, every change and decision has something to do with sex and if Lars let the audience themselves to retrospect the feminism. From a non-essentialist perspective, Joe's life choice shouldn't be analyzed in a gender context, although the social convention and stereotypes makes the assumption that woman leading a licentious life would be recognized as schizophrenia and sinful yet male womanizer would be shouldering much less pressure. I think it doesn't matter if the lead role happened to be a woman or man, it's all their own tragic but willful choice. Eccentuating the historical differences between genders is no longer the task of feminism, especially not in an old schooled preaching way. Joe's sexual adventure shouldn't be comparing to men's to make it justified, the very categorization itself in an unnecessary context would be fallen into the scope of social stereotype, thought nothing condemnable, there's more I expected from the proclaimed-to-be-feminist movie.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

This is not a film about porn or sex, it is about a condition that most people will fail to understand.The film(s) are refreshing in the sense that they are not mainstream or Hollywood, they attempt to put into perspective many subjects which society prefers to ignore..Not for the faint of heart but definitely worth watching.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

At first its quite slow but as it goes on it becomes more and more interesting and both characters show nice point of views. The acting is decent and I didn't find the sex-scenes to offending. Apart from being slow the biggest reason I only give a 6/10 is the ending..The ending is unreasonable and a not needed shock factor It was completely out of place and actually ruined it for me If you exclude the ending I could have given a 8/10.All in all, If its worth watching is up to you.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

Not only is the final act a giant figurative middle finger to the audience, but it also decides to give all the characters completely new personalities just to be able to create a shocking ending. What is so infuriating about the ending, is that there was no built-up or anything suggesting that the characters were capable of doing these acts. It is not as if only one character were to do something that is ""outside of their character,"" but it is pretty much everyone in the movie decides to do something completely unlike themselves all at the same time, just to be able to have an unsatisfying climactic conclusion. Other than the final act, the other scenes also seem to delve more into fetishism instead of focusing on the central ""problem,"" which is her sex addiction (or nymphomania). The movie rails off into an unwanted territory and brings all 4+ hours of these two volumes to not only a disappointing ending, but also an ending that is insulting to its audience.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
99,aboettinger1,Not what you might think.,7,11 November 2021,"I have a theory that this movie isn't what it appears on the surface. It is presented as the story of a sex addict, or ""Nymphomaniac"". However, I take it to be the ultimate ""unreliable narrator"" story.My theory is this: Joe, the main character is not a nymphomaniac, she is a psychopath out for blood. She even admits to wanting to kill someone near the end of the movie. Though she is talking about a specific person, I believe her intent is clear, she will do whatever it takes to seduce a man, thus giving her just cause to kill him.There are several hints along the way that we have no reason to believe anything she says. On two different occasions she tells Seligman that she never saw Jerome again even though he shows up in her life two more times. Perhaps the biggest clues are the fact that her ENTIRE STORY revolves around things she sees in the room that she is in and cues she takes from Seligman himself.For his part, Seligman even points out multiple times that there are too many coincidences for her story to be believed; Joe has to guilt him back into her narrative. From the opening of her story, beginning with the fish hook on the wall we can see Joe as the fisher and Seligman as the fish. Her story is the bait.We even see Joe put this method to use on another character when she rattles off a series of sexual scenarios to blackmail someone into paying a debt. This part of her life is perhaps the closest thing to truth she has told Seligman.From the time she entered his house, her intent was to seduce Seligman. Her story twists and turns in an attempt to pinpoint what exactly will arouse him but he won't bite. And then she realizes he's asexual and everything goes downhill.And she gets her kill.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

Apart from me being very nice and generous it was a terrible movie, in fact. 1. Not only does he try to inject some ""intellectual"" lines within the script but he also mentions a few problems of philosophy of mathematics which are not taken seriously any more (e.g. Zeno's Paradox)2. Philosophical references are pretty naive and fail to draw attention from those who at least have read one or two pages from philosophy, logic or mathematics.3. Although its cinematography is very weak and restricted Lars von Trier did not hesitate to make such a long movie, apparently. 4. Relatively weak script and absolutely weak cinematography, obviously, is not the best combination to make a long movie; it is just making it dull, boring and almost pointless. 5. What is the premise anyway? ---spoiler--- Why did she kill him though he was merely jerking off and why on earth would a man say something like ""oh you f*cked thousands of men, so what?"" when a gun is pointed towards his freaking face? ---spoiler---6.

101,clare-karu,An accurate copy,9,21 March 2014,"12 hours after seeing 'NYMPHOMANIAC' and my brain is still bent all out of shape from the ending. This woman is betrayed in the most searing way possible - that is - by her one true friend. He has listened to her story, appeared to comprehend it and offer her resolution, not only that but armed her with the knowledge to kill him - and yet his final words are still of surprise 'But You've slept with thousands of men.'So this is the final word on the nature of sexual desire - it will overcome the most reasoned, civilised person imaginable. And if a woman wants to protect herself from unwanted sexual advances - she better know her way around a gun.Nymphomaniac I and II cannot be separated from one another - however I appears to be the lure and its casting and II appears to be the process of being dragged to shore only to be filleted and fried in hot oil.But what of Joe? We are left literally in the dark as to what is to become of her. Nor does the last word go to her. This brilliant movie is deliberately frustrating.I must say though - its Von Triers best. 9/10 cos nothing perfect is without flaws.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

I came upon this movie blindsided but still surprised of how more and more heavy violence this film gotten compared to the first. The very first Nymphomanic was mainly and mostly sex, that's all. But the sequel takes it to a whole new toll, a screwed up toll I shall say. I might need a lot of therapeutic help after seeing this flick. The night I saw this, I had crazy nightmares about the one scene with the woman and her abortion while people were beating on her. I was so scared. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, don't waste your precious time on it.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
103,dcharold,Darker than the first volume,7,9 March 2014,"Nymphomaniac Part II is a far darker film than Part I. If the first is the film of innocence then this is of experience and its costs. (Notably the very fine Stacy Martin of Part I disappears early on in this volume with the role being taken over by Gainsbourg). It's also a lot more in keeping with Von Trier's other recent films. Make of that what you will. Personally I found it hard going, but there can be no question that it raises provocative questions about consent and victim hood how those things can transform otherwise identical acts. It briefly flirts with the idea that gender can transform those identical acts too, but in a rushed way that doesn't feel like it really interested the film makers much. Humanist it certainly is and yet, ultimately, somewhat misanthropic too. I doubt I'll need to see this part again, but was glad to have seen it once. If the rumoured Director's Cut of 5+ hours eventually surfaces I'll certainly watch it. Challenging.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
104,windycitytoast,Volume I Vs. Volume II,8,7 March 2014,"After watching Volume I, I decided to continue on to Volume II. One of the major differences is that Volume I is acted out by Young Joe (Stacy Martin) while Volume II is older Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourgh). I found Charlottes performance to be more believable of someone who is a nymphomaniac, which propelled the story to much greater heights than in Volume I. Another comparison of the two is the tone and pacing. Volume I seemed much longer because there is much more symbolism to music, nature, and mathematics brought up by Seligman(Stellan Skarsgaard) when Joe is explaining her childhood and past affairs. Von Trier takes a lot of time in the first half to make random connections to Joe's experiences, some for comedic effect and others that try to connect sexual prowess with nature. For example when Joe loses her virginity the first time to Jerome(Shia Labeouf). Seligman refers to it as the Fibinachi Sequence when Joe explains that Jerome penetrated her 3 times in the vagina and 5 times anally which equals 8. (I know, I couldn't believe they tried to even make this connection the first time I saw it as well.) A better example is how Seligman connects fly fishing to Joe and B's escapades on the train. The connection of reeling in the perfect catch(men), and how its illustrated in the film by Joe and B scouring the different train compartments, going from men who are less reserved to men that are more choosy when it comes to who they sleep with. There are a few other instances like this in Volume I, which is why the pacing is much slower and the tone is bleak. Another reason the pacing is slower is because Volume I spends much more time on introducing the characters that shapes Joe's experiences such as Joes Father(Christian Slater, M(Uma Thurman, Jerome, B(Sophia Kennedy Clark), and Seligman. The pacing and tone of Volume II is much different because it jumps right into the thick of Joe's darkest experiences being a Nymphomaniac. From the very start of Volume II, we the audience are shown that Joe can no longer feel pleasure from sex. Like a drug someone abuses, Joe's tolerance is so high that she has to resort to cheating, threesome, and fetishes in order to feel pleasure herself, this includes being whipped by a man who has no sympathy for how she feels on the inside.( He full on punches her in the face and even calls her ""Fido""). We are shown the gravity of Joe's decisions and who they affect, 1. Marcel, Joe and Jerome's baby almost falls off the balcony unattended because Joe is waiting for her fetish appointment. 2. Jerome ends up taking Marcel and leaves Joe. 3. Jerome can't raise Marcel on his own and ends up leaving him in foster care. The Pedophilia Scene definitely stuck in my head as the most disturbing of the film though. The reason i choose to discuss this scene is because it shows us the severity of Joe's addiction and you will know what I mean when you see it for yourself. Each character that Joe interacts with in Volume II whether its K ( the guy who whips and beats her for pleasure, L (Willem Dafoe)~ the man who proposes that Joe run her own loan sharking business by using her own means of sexual persuasion, and P(Mia Goth)~ the girl that Joe takes under her wing. all enable Joe in some way to go further down the rabbit hole. Basically all the scenes in Volume II are either disturbing or violent in someway compared to Volume I, which is why the tone and pacing is much different between the two. Violence- 3/5- the scenes were Joe is getting beaten and whipped by K for fetish, we see parts of her body bruised and bloody. When she is beaten to the curb, Joe has blood all over her face. And at the end although we don't see it, it is implied and heard that Joe kills Seligman after he tries to sleep with her.(Unbelievable scene)Language-3/5- A good amount of ""F"" Bombs, few instances of C***, Sh**, Bi***..etcSexuality- 5/5- Altogether I would say out of the 4 hour film there is an hour that have scenes or shots of fetish, penetration, fellatio, pedophilia, full frontal nudity. Some are shot far away/ Some are up close.Adult Situations- 5/5- This film deals with someone who is a Nymphomaniac, her experiences are disturbing and brutal because many times throughout the film she is chasing a high that becomes harder and harder to get as her tolerance for it increases. The film shows the destructive sides of being a Nymphomaniac( especially as a woman) such as abuse, womanizing, adultery, pedophilia, adoption, putting your addiction above your family and health. *Joe has a good relationship with her father, but not with her mother. Ex. When Joes Father (Christian Slater is on his deathbed, only Joe comes to visit. Joe has resentment towards her mother for not coming to see her dying husband. *There is a scene depicting the consequences of Adultery where M (Uma Thurman confronts Joe and her ex-husband by bringing the children to Joe's apartment. The situation is tense and heartbreaking, as M finds out that Joe doesn't even love M's husband who has just left her and the children. *The scene where Joe is punched in the face a few times by K may also be quite disturbing. *The scene where Joe's plan of trying to kill P's boyfriend fails as the gun is botched, ends up getting beaten to the ground. *The scene at the end of the film may disturb some viewers as well, when Seligman who is asexual,tries to force himself into Joe when she is sleeping. Overall a pretty interesting film, I give it an 8/10 for good acting, great storytelling, and imagery.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

106,Jesse-Hirsbrunner,I expected more,6,4 February 2020,"I don't know if it is fair to split the movie in two parts and give different ratings because it is basically one long movie, but i did it because it is how IMDb ratings work this way.While i absolutely enjoyed the first part, i think the second part is not on the same level. Some chapters are still very good, but in the end the movie gets more and more absurd. Everything after the BDSM-chapter just seemed like Von Trier just tried to get more extreme without any longer focussing on the characters that made the first part as strong as it was.At the same time I started to get bored while i thought the movie was also rushed. Maybe the Directors Cut is better, but i did not enjoy the last few chapters at all in the normal version.While the ending might give you some interesting thoughts, it was in my opinion out of character and once again rushed.Obviously Part II once again has terrific actors, a wonderful camera, good music and so on, but the plot became worse and the movie lacked in many parts the creativity of the first part, especially in the last 45 minutes.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
107,brondibur,Worst possible ending,5,3 May 2016,"I watched this for more than 3 hours and the director screwed it all up in 1 minute. 3 effing hours to watch an ending that made me want to punch the director in his teethThe movie wasn't bad. Same as the first part, Volume 2 goes on with a lot of porn and short conversations between Joe and Seligman which were accompanied with a few of his nonsensical observations with symphonies in the background.I especially liked the father and all of his scenes and his thoughts. I disliked some internal love stories within the story which I thought were completely unnecessary. It is unclear whether Lars Von Trier is for or against feminism. The theme alternates between the two. The first volume clearly depicts Seligman as the acceptable part of the society and Joe, the nymphomaniac the other part. Towards the end of Volume 2 the movie draws a comparison between men and women and how the same actions of both genders elicit different responses from the society.Let's say the movie(both parts) was exactly 5 hours long. So at the end of 4 hours and 59 minutes, I was happy. There was a feeling of completion, even with all the porn and stupid observations. Everything fit in and made sense. Then, when it was time for credits, the director couldn't control his urge to ruin it all and does exactly that.It is alright if you don't want a happy ending. There could have been anything. Any effing thing. But Lars has got to end it with extreme bs. If only he had given 30 minutes to think about how he must end it, he would have come up with something better. I guess after making a 5 hour long movie, one must not have the energy left to think for a scene which is only one minute. Call it what you want, a bad ending will always be a bad ending.Also, I read some review regarding feces. It said even if you look at it as art, admire the colours and textures, it still remains feces. Why I agree with this is because some scenes, which may be art to some delusional fools, are nothing but gore. Some of them are disgusting. Rating - 5 because ending makes it a bad movie. I invested 5 long hours into this only to be disappointed in the end. P.S - I saw the Director's cut.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
108,Hasek,One of the great modern feminist/female empowerment films,9,31 May 2017,"I admit to having mixed feelings about so much negativity regarding Nymphomaniac. Yes, Nymphomaniac is a single 5 hour film. Much like previous attempts to separate films into two features (Kill Bill, The Matrix sequel), these ""two"" films do not work separately. Also, I imagine many are viewing the theatrical releases, versions neither edited nor approved by director Lars Von Trier, who instead of creating two shorter ""watered down"" visions deferred to his assistant and instead focused on he director's cut. And that is where this film comes alive. It saddens me that the casual film-goer would dismiss such an ambitious, challenging, cumulatively awe-inspiring composition, yet un-surprised by the lazy and prudish instinct when it comes to empathizing with both stigmatized femininity, taboo sex and fear of something bold.As a single, sprawling opus, Nymphomaniac comprehensively confronts the realities of sex from the point of view of a woman, tracking her along the many emotional highs and lows through her life. Many have been put off by the (at times) graphic sex and ""other"" imagery, but the unflinching nature of these scenes is meant to convey the truth of her at first shameless and, gradually, self-judgmental self image, as she is slowly broken down by culture. It is a glorious, painful, and ultimately, triumphant protest for female empowerment, for female voice, albeit clothed in appropriately harsh packaging, and a reminder that even in such seemingly liberated times, women are still slaves to expectation, to morality, to public and patriarchal pressure, not their own desire, and the film is a harsh critic of this. Confronting difficult or ignored topics is rarely comfortable, and this film holds nothing back in passionately and comprehensively defining the prison of culture so many women aspire to transcend.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
109,jeppe-jacobsen,The most important film for me in 2013,10,26 May 2014,"I love Lars' films more than many people, I guess. My favorite is ""The Kingdom""(Riget), and there was actually in this film (thanx Lars) a cross cut to the opening scene of that series in one of the many cleverly montaged sequences of storytelling. Here: Automatic doors being a metaphor about Joe's genitals. What an imagination... And if you dare watch this movie with an open mind taking into account that you will be challenged, you've got a very nasty, grimy, thought provoking beautiful piece of art here. I cannot express my dismissal enough of the total misunderstanding that this should under any circumstance be gazed upon as a pornographic film. Yes, it has nudity! Yes, there are genitals, there's intercourse. It's NOT a children's movie. This is, however, excellent for intellectual adults who can appreciate or at least accept the need for Lars Von Trier to use these forms of expression, what ever explicit, because: If you understand the storyline and if you actually become interested in Joe's person and psychology, it's really quite obvious that it's not about sex. It's about suffering and sacrifice. Religious themes, basically. Porno, on the other hand, is as far from those terms as anything could ever be. - Like you see it in ""Breaking the waves"" and ""Dancer in the dark"", it's portrays another female sacrifice. Another fall. During the watch you will start to feel annoyed by the explicit sex but that's because Lars wants you to feel annoyance as a reference to the suffering, Joe goes through. If that's enough for you to loose interest, then don't try to watch it. You'll be in for more of it. A frenzy of it. If, however, you, like me, find these matters of great importance in the understanding of life in your civilization, then you could be in for one of the most challenging and important films of the decade. I mean it. There is, no matter if you like or not, a new wave and a new level of sexual awareness in the world today that demands attention. There is still ""uncharted territory"", if you will. That's where Lars Von Trier insist upon taking you in this brave film. I feel like mentioning The Eurovision song contest for taking up the same themes this year but in a childish and indifferent way. For comparison, this film is NOT indifferent and I recommend seeing the film over some time so you let it settle. Four hours is a lot but the time spent is very very important for you to accept what is going on. No spoilers attached.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
110,christina_dobreva,Too deep to see the sex in it,9,28 March 2014,"The second volume is indeed more brutal and explicit but leaves the same unexplainable to the fullest taste like the first one. Joe seems to be losing everything and everyone in her life but not herself and her soul. The moment she realizes she's not the freak she thought she was, reveals the depth of her pure feelings. Von Trier's perception on this is explained by a huge amount of rudeness, yet at the same time simplicity in sex and passion. When Joe seems to lose her sensitivity, typical for a woman, she's the weakest thing on earth. Who'd blame her and von Trier for that? The movie contains such a small amount of sex that those connected to the story in depth would not even see it. This is not a porn movie. It's too dramatic to be one.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

This is art! Isn't it?"" Basically, the story of emperor's new clothes at its finest. I will be bold enough to say that no, I'm not missing anything. It really is just sh** I'm looking at. My final thought at the end of both volumes was ""wow, those are hours I'm never going to get back."" And it's not that the movie was all bad. Charlotte is wonderful, as are all the other actors. The topic is interesting. I didn't mind the nudity and I wasn't offended by any of it. There just isn't any point to it at all! None. Just when you think there may be some point in the friendship she develops with an asexual male, the story stuffs that thought into the toilet in the most confusing unnecessary way. Or when you think there is some point to her love story with Jerome, that is trashed in a very stupid way too. And if the director thinks that he is building up, just to let us down, well, he fails to build anything up since the whole movie is so boring and monotone. There just no point. And if the point of the movie is that there is no point, then why the Hell am I stuck staring at the screen for so long? Anyways, I am utterly disappointed. This is poop.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

Yes, it can be arousing at some moments, but then something happens that changes the direction of the story. I guess it's hard for people like Joe. If I would be a nymphomaniac I would be a bad one because of my shy personality. I would die just because I couldn't get sex and that would drive me mad, probably.

115,Miriup,Each story element was awesome but they played together in cacophony.,7,2 May 2014,"Not really a review, but I need to add some spice to the soup.Vol I it took me several days to make it far enough into the movie to appreciate it and watch it fully, but then I really liked it. It seemed to start off as a pornish B-movie, but the dialogs became increasingly good. So good in fact that I felt compelled to write some of them down. So I thought the way the movie started off was necessary to create the pretext for its finer messages that were about to unfold.Vol II however started off as slowly and discouraging as the first part. But now the scene has already been set, so there would be no artistic excuse for making it that bad. It made me also remember that during watching Vol-I I kept thinking that the movie could have been made better. Unlike some other reviewers I found the porn elements in general helped keeping the perspective, but especially in the Vol II the story really lacked and porn was almost all there was. It could have easily been a 1h movie or less.I did like the ending very much and hence vote it a 7.In general I felt as if the ultimate control over the story and the movie was with multiple very different-minded people and what the movie really lacked was someone who would bring those multiple perspectives onto the story playing together in symphony.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
116,androgineus,"Those who say Nymphomaniac is a porn movie, didn't watch it carefully",9,4 August 2014,"The explicit scenes with nudity do not make this film porn. Between those scenes there are lengthy conversations on serious topics like religion, music, sex even mathematics, you won't find in any other film. Lars von Trier proves with every of his movie that he is the philosopher of our time, and what I personally like is his provocative character. He mocks those calling him a Nazi, by trying to explain his view on Nazism and antisemitism in this film. One of the main characters in Nymphomaniac is Seligman, who is a Jew and who himself says he is anti- Zionist, which is not the same as being antisemite. He also talks with admiration about German culture, especially about German music, like Bach, Wagner and Beethoven. Lars von Trier has been criticized a lot for the technical aspect of his films. When it comes to photography, he can be the master, (as a fan of Carl Theodor Dreyer, von Trier even has his coat in his possession, it is noticeable he studied him carefully) just watch his movies Europa and Elements of Crime, or even Melancholia in which there are couple of scenes which are the master piece of European cinematography, but he decides to break all the rules intentionally, and not out of lack of knowledge (which is again part of his provocative nature). He also pays respect to his favorite directors Tarkovsky and Kubrick by using music from their films. In the end, this film is about love, most of all, just as Breaking the Waves is, but from a different point of view, even the under-title itself Nymphomaniac says it, forget about love. Although Joe, the main character in the film persistently denies loves, she is still not completely unaffected by it. Her relationship with her father is the purest love, then also her relationships with Jerome and P. grow into love, whereas P. is someone who she identifies with and she unselfishly wants to help, but P. as her true successor shows no empathy for her in the end. Eventually almost everyone of us, has had experience with failed love in their lives, just here it is matter of a sickness, which the society condemns and fails to understand. That's why she manages to have sympathy even for a pedophile, who has suppressed his urge all his life and has never hurt anyone, because they both have something in common, unaccepted sexuality and loneliness.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
117,anaclaudia-7,"Everything is explicit, even the meaning if you pay attention",9,29 January 2014,"I'm thinking about buying a new dictionary so I can express myself correctly because I left the movies basically without expression on my face. Still can't find the exact word to describe it but I'll do my best.In 'Nymphomaniac Vol. I' we enter in Joe's life to discover how is really to be a sex addicted and living with that - since the very beginning: her childhood problems, her lack of motherly love, her infinite connection with her purist father, her first perverse tendencies (and believe me this movie is so rich of great images and performances that I used to think impossible to reach). After 5 chapters of explanation I wondered what could happen in volume II...The answer is, basically, everything.'Nymphomaniac Volume II' is priceless, superb, in its own way so madly profound that you can't get one single word to describe it perfectly.The (again) reference to the '3+5' already seen in the first volume is like a code to understand all of the movie's essence! Those numbers will always be an association to the first time Joe got intercourses, with Jerôme, to her deep pain and unbelievable disappointment to the succeed. She tries to avoid that sequence of numbers but she has no option but living it once again, this time just watching it happen in front of her eyes, by Jerôme, after being beaten by him.'8' can't be considered just the sum of 3 with 5. '8' is the key. The key to the meaning and purpose of this all Lars Von Trier's story and the key to the beauty itself. '8' is an infinite symbol, turned 90 degrees (something that makes perfect sense when Seligman refers that everything we know - thanks to our daily routine - fastly becomes common and hides its truly meaning - to reveal it, we need to see it from another perspective) - that's why when you rotate that '8' you can see a reference to Joe's infinite desire to be accomplished and satisfied sexually.Despite my long explanation I feel I cannot find enough words/expressions to describe 'Nymphomaniac' as it needs. Such beauty should be just seen and absorbed.Charlotte Gainsbourg is a real woman. Her performance is stunning! I really enjoyed all the nasty moves of Stacy Martin but let's be honest: is easier for a young girl to accept and do a roll based on sex than for a woman who probably has kids in real life to do scenes like the one she is shared by two black-guys at some cheap motel room, just to experiment a new sexual sensation. All of it requires a lot of matureness and dedication but specially an open-mind that the majority of the adult actresses doesn't have.Willem Dafoe shows himself to the world for a few minutes as a badass guy - you see... this one is one of those rare actors that every time he appears on the big screen everyone around you notice it.With a great pity, Uma Thurman doesn't appear in this volume to fulfill my most depressive desires on a roll.'Nymphomaniac' is probably one of the most complete masterpieces I've seen lately - has passion, has pain, has emotion, has fierce, has no shame talking about sex.The violence showned will probably move the most sensitive ones.

I would highly recommend this movie for all open minded people who have a certain degree of understanding of gender issues. I can see how this movie has struck a moral cord in some people, by offending them with graphic displays of intercourse and openly proclaimed nymphomania of the main protagonist, but by condemning this movie they are missing the point:they are precisely acting upon the same higher moral ground this movie is trying to problematize.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

The drastic images of self-abortion and self- inflicted pain, as well as the vulgar sex scenes; I am not a qualified psychologist/psychiatrist, but it all seems a little vague and improbable to me. It is sort of upsetting that a film spiked with such great cast (from Charlotte Gainsbourg, Shia LaBeouf, Uma Thurman, Stellan Skarsgaard and Willem Dafoe) brought such poor outcome. Changes between the young/old characters for Joe and Jerome did not work for me either - the plot lost out on even more of its scarce credibility.

I could barely sit through the first half, I had to stop 2 minutes into Volume II. I love the way his films are shot, they look amazing. But watching 2 hours of a movie, with a plot that basically doesn't exist in my eyes. Just a lot of sex scenes and talking. If you want to watch this to see the nudity and/or sex scenes, it's really not worth it. I have no idea why people think Lars is such a good filmmaker. This movie was a complete waste of time. The only redeeming factor is that he pushes the envelope by putting scenes of sex scenes that are not simulated. You're better off watching some free porn on the internet.

121,supcik-928-911284,A good movie,8,9 April 2014,"2 points for the beginning: Firstly: it is just slightly erotic , (not really too much perhaps 5% of time is some nudity), it is a philosophical film. Secondly: one should see both film parts.The core of the movie is in the dialog on Joe's life. Her part is a recapitulation, his part is therapy/investigation. What is superb about this movie is how unusually some life or philosophical concepts/notions are being unveiled. One is confronted by its sincerity and our tolerance (hypocrisy) towards unusual. This is a very precious trait for any media piece. It probably could not help but aim to being misunderstood and scandalized. It is hard to fully relate to the personages, as their strangeness is paraded in their pondering; yet all works in some intellectual way. Joe for some reason {being a strange person proud of her flaws} tried to find some allegories to her story and her encyclopedic partner was happily seeing things in the different lights. So hail to the form. Her story itself was just a fantastic collage. Lots of unusual, bordering comical episodes that may happen to some meek unscrupulous sex addict (which is a super-rare trait combination). The personality-forming part of the teenage fu**ing club could have been described broader to bring us to understand/to relate to the main character better. I did not get why there were the parts with the father {his old version by the way did not grow old enough}. I did not like the very last(last 10 sec)arty end, the film was arty enough.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
122,usmansarwar,A pretty decent movie. Do not believe the barrage of 1 star ratings.,8,20 September 2014,"I am kind of weary of the multitudes of 1 star reviews. Seems to be some conscious effort to limit this movie's viewership. Anyway the movie is well shot, well acted and interesting throughout its 2 parts. A bit laborious and (in a self aware manner) takes liberties with coincidence. However, if you can stomach a little bit of nudity, which apparently so many pitchfork yielding IMDb users can not, do watch it. I absolutely hated Shia Lebouf and his fake and faulty British accent though..Lars Von Trier is a good film maker. Personally, I thought Melancholia was brilliant.

The only good thing I can say about this is that Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgard both deliver - as they always do.

126,demetrio-pereira,"He just couldn't resist, could he?",6,17 March 2014,"Lars Von Trier indeed would be pretentious, ridiculously desperate to 'épater la bourgeoisie', IF he was a realist. But he directs fables, he's like Jose Saramago with a camera - the symbolism always justifies what you'll see in, say, 'Antichrist'.In 'Nymphomaniac vol. 2', Von Trier disqualifies this kind of reviewer's relief. The message is antiintelectualist, and in yet another seesaw of Nature vs. Culture the reason is left, with no hope or consolation, with the animal that recognizes itself as 'bad person' and paints humanity with one single predicate - hypocrisy. It's like Von Trier committing suicide and leaving a letter saying that, in the end, despite all those eloquent minutes, it was all just porn delivered to people hypocritically faking to want anything more or less than that.I could say the first one is really good. Hell, vol.2 was alright up until the end. But Von Trier just couldn't resist himself. He makes Joe murder the semiotics and silence the hermeneuticists, the exegetes, the false Candids and Christs - there's no hope, only sick rapists with nice speeches. And then Joe runs away, and with her goes Von Trier, mocking those who stay, singing hate to say I told you so, now deal with it, look how unpredictable I am, don't you try to decipher me, I'm a genius, nobody catches me etc.OK, then.

And as a movie with such a natural theme, personally I think that anyone who sees it, should be very open minded for what the director wants to express. If this is your first time enjoying a Von Trier film, you should be very aware, that he puts anything he wants in his movies, so be prepared to see and hear things that probably won't match the standards that you are used to. He uses very specific screen editions to catch the viewers attention and later totally forgets about them, making it very disappointing of you are expecting other things. I'm very sorry to hear that many people has reviewed this as a bad movie or, what's even worst, a sexist movie. I strongly recommend that if you are one of this group of people, you give Nymphomanic another try, but this time, try to see through the directors mind, focusing on the change of ratios, the screen signs and the colors that he uses depending on the mood of the scene. I'm not saying this is a movie for everyone, but if you start seeing it with prejudice just because of the thematic, you are going to hate it for sure.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
130,luckske,Unexpectedly gripping,8,18 February 2014,"Seeing as there are two parts to one story, I will be reviewing both here. I see no point in writing them separately. I'm not the biggest fan of Lars Von Trier, usually the cinematography really keeps me interested, but then in retrospect (especially after revisiting his movies on the small screen) I tend to care less for them.I have to say this is the best movie(s) I've seen of him so far.The creativity and quirkiness of the first movie, along with the great imagery, was for me the best part. My biggest problem was with the protagonist, she really irked me to no end. Both the rudeness of current-day Joe as the apathy and the incapability to communicate of teenage/twenties Joe really bothered me to no end. The saving factor for me in the first movie was in the last scene, where she loses her capability of achieving orgasm. It made up for the entire movie as far as I'm concerned. Her life events weren't really that interesting, and her motivation wasn't all too clear. I thought the connection with her father was convincing and well done, but not much more has stuck with me from the first film. Seligman, meanwhile, tells allegorical anecdotes that connect to her life events. I thought this was really nice. Much as the last scene saves the first film, the last scene in the second film wrecked it, for me. This doesn't imply that I thought that the film was bad, however.The second film shows more of the monogamous relationship of Joe, and how this fails to satisfy her. Her man (Shia Leboeuf, who, incidentally, also deflowered her when they were teens) realizes she is unhappy and tells her it's OK for her to go out and seek additional satisfaction outside of her sex life. She does so, and in the process gets on more and more experimental and masochistic territory. Push comes to shove and her man forces her to choose between her family and her obsession, and she chooses the latter. Time goes on and she becomes involved in the business of debt claiming, since she knows a lot about men's weaknesses. The transgression of the character into a criminal setting isn't really explained, and handled a bit clumsily. You could argue that it's of no importance, and you'd be right. It wasn't too bothersome. She is inspired by Willem Dafoe to manipulate a young girl into working for her by gaining her trust and filling a void her absent parents left. This works, and they have a sort of romance. A day comes when Joe has to collect debt from her ex, and she lets her protégée take care of it, pleading her not to damage anything nor hurt him. After his last payment takes place her protégée doesn't come back home, she goes to her ex's house and sees them making out. She is very hurt and decides to wait in an alley and tries to shoot him in the head. She subconsciously blocks herself from doing so as she didn't cock the gun before pulling the trigger. They beat her up and humiliate her, and this is the setting where Seligman finds Joe.During the course of this film I got a lot more feeling for the character, an understanding surges that she is merely a victim of her condition, just as anyone else. Finally (!) I felt very sympathetic towards her. She says that telling the story has been very cathartic to her and she resolves to fight her obsession with every fiber in her being, so she can live free. I thoroughly enjoyed her revelation. She goes on to express her relief for being incapable of the act of murder, as this would've chained her for life. I agree.The last minute which puts everything Topsy-turvy is when she finally goes to sleep, hopeful for the future. Seligman wishing her good night and leaving. Except, he doesn't. He reappears without pants and tries to penetrate her. She is shocked and outraged and he is confused because ""she's slept with thousands of men"". She cocks the gun, shoots him, and leaves.This was somewhat nauseating for me. Seligman effectively undoes all of the progress made during the films, and seals both their fates. Mind you, it is an acceptable ending to me, it didn't feel forced or out of the character's personality. It's been determined during the entire film that he's capable of cool rationalization because he considers himself asexual; he's effectively a virgin. He plays very well, he's a pudgy man-child, resembling a Russian toddler, a figurehead of impotence. During the films it crossed my mind that he might want to take advantage of such an opportunity. And he does. And he does it clumsily, as his character would have. And he doesn't realize the destruction it brings with it, as his character wouldn't. It works, I really think it does. But it just made me sad, I wish it hadn't happened. But to feel for the characters is just a sign that the movie is good.Further: It is a bit difficult to place this film within this reality as a lot of the events are a bit on the absurd side. For example: the man who beats up women who voluntarily come to him; or the two African men who want to double team the protagonist and aren't bothered when she suddenly leaves. Something that struck me as odd is the age progression of the protagonist and her romantic interest. First you get the progression of twenty something Joe into full blown Charlotte Gainsbourg Joe. This is fine, but her man is still Shia Leboeuf. When more time progresses, also Shia Leboeuf is replaced. It's a bit awkward, but not painful.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

It's pathetic. Finding this movie arousing is akin to watching ""Candy"" and feeling the desire to do some drugs after.The second volume retains that raw beauty which can be found in the first volume, but is definitely darker and grittier.

133,Wild_Fox,"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him",10,13 August 2014,"As I cba to write 2 reviews for 1 movie, this review will also be posted for N()c pt.2Did somebody already mention there's some sex and nudity shown?It comes with the territory.The movie centers around the meeting of two human souls, who have embarked on completely different life paths. Joe is a nymphomaniac, while Seligmann, having found early in life that sex doesn't do much for him, considers himself to be asexual. Joe agrees to tell Seligmann her life story, on the condition that he will listen to her without prejudice. Seligmann is able to do so, because he doesn't focus on the sexual nature of her adventures. Time and again he draws parallels between sex and seduction, and the same 'techniques and principles' applied to sports, arts, music and even religion. At first Joe gets really annoyed by this: she feels he's not taking her seriously. But eventually they find common ground, and there's a growing mutual interest in each other's point of view. Time and again Seligmann absolves her from her self imposed negative self esteem until, when the morning has come and her story has ended, she no longer wants to argue with him and she is truly able to see herself through his eyes. With her rediscovered innocence and newly found love for who she is, she has a powerful psychological transformation and she renounces sex... not because of morality, but she realizes it is killing her.For all this I was willing to award this movie a 9/10. For just one thing bothered me: the ending.Why then, why, I wondered, would LvT opt for this completely nonsensical ending, when Seligmann decided it would be a good idea to creep up to her in the dark for a bit of hubbahubba? This makes completely no sense: not only is he asexual (I didn't notice any alleged repressed feelings in him), it would also be virtually impossible for him to betray - literally within an hour! - their fresh and fragile bond of friendship... not after all this understanding he has shown to her so far.Is it that the alternative would be even worse for LvT? That he wouldn't want the viewer to be left behind with some 'happily ever after - feeling'? Some statement that there's no such thing as true human understanding? A cynical twist?But after a few days it hit me. LvT upped the ante even more in the very last minute. He wants to take us *all the way* to the core of the human spirit: There is no higher authority than the authority that can be found within, and to answer that call one must be prepared to give up everything else - even your love for the authority that brought you this far...Or, as they say in the Zen koan: If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him!So Joe the no-mo-hoe has to kill Seligmann the blessed-but-also-fallible-hu-mann, who helped her to discover her Buddha nature, but also threatened to take it from her.We are a mirror to each other, but we are not allowed to rely on anything or anybody outside of us. That's the message of this film. It's LvT's rendering of the old Zen koan in 21st century art.How could this movie get less than 10 out of 10?",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

If Lars Van Trier wanted to do a porno he should have done one because in my opinion that's what this was but sans the titillation. I really do not understand the point behind the film and the actors all seemed to be in some hazy-type state. I did not even get through the movie because I was really only interested to see what all the hype was about. so i cannot elaborate completely on the premise but from what i saw i passed over most of it and was thoroughly not impressed.

139,lapetitebaobab,Not that bad,8,20 April 2014,"People who watch Lars von Trier movies should have an idea of what to expect; when you pay for a movie ticket, spend hours or days downloading files or more importantly sitting and watching his work, being judgmental is not going to help your probable enjoyable experience. Think about Kim Ki-duk, another prolific filmmaker, who you either love or hate, and Lars von Trier is not different in that regard. Yes, Lars von Trier is controversial, has always been, and so coming up with prudishness is a very hypocrite gesture, for supposed cinephiles. Again, if you decide to watch a movie, any kind of movie, you are supposed to be open to the logic of it, and to at least try to follow the idea that is exposed in it, and until having watched at least a part of it, decide if it's for you or not. Nymphomaniac has a self-pronounced theme: obsession with sex; we all know the devastating connotations of excess, and to claim or reclaim that this movie is infested with 'pornography instead of art' only shows your own dirty mind and opinionated expectations from a film. It is not pornographic, it does not have any real confrontational sex scenes, it has a story and artistry, what else do you want? Yes, it has its flaws, like the color of eyes that differ between actresses, as they change, representing a different epoch for the characters and so on, yes, sometimes one realizes that as the story is being told, there are some moments where it is odd how they will get back to the story, and fight away the digressions, but honestly, it is an entertaining story, it always makes you want to know more about it. I personally found it funny, not in an intentional way, or in a dark humored way, only in a very natural one. You do not suffer this movie, if you take the time to see the landscapes, wonder about the musical choices and what is being told. A lot of people accuse the director as misogynist, because he does not always glorify the image of his main characters, he shows their cracks, and that is what precisely makes a difference, just think about the fact that he has always made movies about women, and all of them strong ones, I could tag not only this film, but a few others by him, as feminist.

It is a thought provoking film that I would not suggest watching without your full attention - themes run throughout the two films and it almost comes in a full circle.Having never watched a Lars Von Trier film I really only had one expectation; graphic sex and violence. I watched the first one merely to see what it was like and I knew people that thought it was a masterpiece. 'Masterpiece' is not quite the word I would use, but it was certainly a work of art and one that I would watch again: not for the pleasure, but for the thought provoking ideas of sexuality and the ideas of the soul.The ending was one I mused on for quite some time, wondering why it ended as it did; I could have thought of so many other more satisfying finishes to the five hour epic.

It was like someone was trying to put me in the wrong viewing point - everything felt hard to find honesty and trust you should feel watching such stories . The creepy pseudo-religious references, the mob godfather-like sub stories got me into thinking the author got wasted and felt like amusing the audience rather than being real and honest. I wonder if the abortion scene was more of a a sick requirement of a producer to make you more outraged and shocked than a real part of a movie sequence (I skipped the scene in ff mode) . I stopped watching the movie later and postponed finishing it to the following day , which does not happen with movies I like - I doubt I will find motivation to finish it anyways - no need to spoil the positive feeling I got after the first part.

145,talentedlikenoother,!!! lots of fake reviews !!!,10,13 November 2014,"k so, i didn't watch the movie. i doubt i will. 10/10 was to get your attention.look at all the reviews other than mine. they're all written the same way. it's so obvious that they're the same person over and over making new accounts.every title is written in the same format; each word capitalized. period at the end.the reviews are written the same way; each sentence ends with a period(.) and no space after.like this.no one writes like this.and to have everyone write like this? yea right.every time they use an exclamation point(!) they put a period after. no one ever does that!! and to have every reviewer do it? double yea right.what a bunch of crap. look up each of the accounts. they're all made at the same exact time. they're also all written around the same time, like within a week. so stupid... if you're gonna be a jackass and write a bunch of bogus reviews, don't be so stupidly obvious.i kinda wanna watch this movie just to spite these stupid fake reviews.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
146,funkkysoul2002,A powerful take on traditional sexual,8,5 February 2014,"Nymphomaniac is a film not easily stomached by most individuals (as are most of Lars von Trier's films) but once one has digested the visual hedonism of its being, then comes the actual dialogue that was unique to this film which added the distinct and flavorful aftertaste... and boy does it linger.The attributes that the general population will view as 'pornography' is the actual gritty realism of the Joe's life - nymphomania. If one has any sympathy for a type of disease or an insatiable need (an addiction), they will come to understand that this movie seems to explore addiction from the perspective of each character. The addictions that shape life as well as the absence of these needs entirely as one character seems to demonstrate - the question that remains in the end is that how far can one woman allowed to take her needs in a male dominated society? Each character has their own value in the nymphomaniac's life and changes and shapes her personality to what it becomes in the end. I urge you all before writing distasteful reviews that fuel only some type of parental guidance (this is not a movie for kids obviously) or claiming that this film is porn, to actually take the time to see a deeper meaning within the characters and their dialogue even though it is overshadowed with quite a bit of sex...",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
147,shebly30,Great Movie,9,12 July 2014,"I heard reviews about this upcoming movie when I seen the first trailer and wanted to see it. I always liked strange, raw, and unique films. I actually forgot about this film until I heard bad reviews about it from users on this forum. It kind of made me laugh a little, because tons of user say it's disgusting, but the name says it all and you still watched it. I don't know what anyone was expecting from the film, but actually rawness. It does have a great story, as the story ends it all makes sense. This film is not supposed to be feel good.I watched Spartans and it had same feel, but with fighting; After watching Spartans I was desensitized if anything. I enjoyed all characters of the film and the story. I believe the story is more about her having a sense of control when everything around you is falling apart, and as woman we have a sort of sexual power, which I believe the director was trying to convey. This story has lot of elements to it and thought thinking stuff. I like Charlotte Gainsbourg she one of my all time favorite actors.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

SPOILER!!! When he opened the door I just didn't, and couldn't continue watching. On a personal level, I find it hard to believe that all of a sudden an a-sexual, will become interested in sex, never the less with someone like Jo, especially in her state of hopelessness and new goal of life without sexuality. Overall the story is not very believable, as the character states too much coincidences... It is very graphic, and in my opinion not in a sexy way, but a disturbing way. I am giving this movie a low rate because the storyline does not hold the movie, or justifies two whole movies, and especially because of the poor poor choice of ending...",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
149,wreckid72,boring....,3,29 December 2014,"this movie was utterly boring and, constantly tried to pat itself on the back with the generalized writing. that was supposed to be edgy and shocking. fell asleep half way in, went back watched it in full, because i wanted to see the crazy twist ending, everyone was on about. so disappointed. i thought it was going to have some redeeming quality. because it felt as though there was, supposed to be interesting characters but there isn't. just a lot of random disjointed scenes, that are supposed to create a deep, challenging, thought provoking characters. instead, you get a boring confusing mess of a lead. that has little to no character and, i felt the pace of the film was best described in the lines ""wait i don't understand what just happened with the car?"" ""oh sorry i couldn't help not finishing the end of the chapter"" or something like that.it purposely nods to what a mess of a film it is. not because of the subject matter but, the fact that the scenes could literally be thrown in any order and, you'd still have the same movie... the subject matter and supposed graphic nature of the film didn't bother me at all but i guess it would others. if you've had sex and watched porn then this film wont push any buttons at least in my opinion it doesn't. it such a blatant Hollywood piece of try hard....",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
150,simon_vandyck,Faboulous movie which requires adult audience in order to appreciate,10,6 February 2014,"The movie is great and Lars Von Trier is able to draw your attention to underlying psychological mechanisms of the human mind using explicit imagery. If you fully understand the movie, the explicit images won't even bother or excite you at all. If your conclusion of this movie is that it is a dirty pornographic documentary, i recommend you to watch a Disney movie instead. Indeed it takes some intelligence to understand that Lars Von Trier is talking about life and the daily struggles that we face. It can be seen that first of all sexuality is the strongest force in the human body, and nobody can deny this. Second of all everybody has some degree of 'perversion' inside them. It is then the 'art' of suppressing these 'perversions' in order to function in society. The movie is a very deep psychoanalysis of the most basic and strongest feeling in the human nature. If you want to understand your sexuality I would highly recommend watching Nymphomaniac. Superficially, if you get shocked by explicit images i recommend you go watch a well-behaved Disney movie with a happy end and morale, so your brain does not have to dig too deep.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
151,BearComment,different perspective of a masterpiece,10,11 February 2014,"Reality in this complex movie: a woman is betrayed by the man of her life and wants to get revenge, but her quest fails. She is beaten and humiliated, and chooses to tell a story to an old man about nymphomania. Her story is not real. The story is a fantasy of the cheated woman, a story emerged from jealousy. The movie is about the complicated mental uneasiness due to the certainty of unfaithfulness. She is not a nymphomaniac. She fantasizes about sexual infidelity driven to extremes, being betrayed by the only man she loved. She recomposes her life due to the mental desire derived from revenge. She was the one cheated by her husband. All moments of sex are played amazingly. Female acting is awkward, not nymphomaniac, but cold and with lack of drive, and this is obvious. The lack of orgasm is because sex is phantasmagorical and glacial, unreal, but not oniric, is a kind of sex fantasized as real, derived from jealousy. In her story Joe she grows older, but the social time seems frozen. It makes sense if you understand that her telling of the life story is not real for her. Real is the fact that she was betrayed by the only man of her life, that she wanted revenge, that she judged herself for being betrayed. One key of the story is that her life story is recomposed according to her actual state of mind. The old man did not seem to understand anything. As neither a great part of the audience ... and many critics ... Seeing explicit sex on screen usually blocks viewing the real perspective or hearing the real story of a woman in pain. A masterpiece about the complexity of the female mind, about the phantasmatic options derived from jealousy: revenge by sexuality or violence. The abandonment of sexuality opens the way for violence. The movie is clearly not about nymphomania, but about nymph-mania, meaning excessive desire for metamorphosis ... the desire for change to overcome the impasse created by jealousy ... Fantastic!",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
152,nair-linh,"Sensitive, realistic, but...",7,21 March 2014,"First of all, it's not porn. I would like to say there's a huge difference between porn and this movie. What I thought is that this movie was in fact very sentimental and realistic. It's clear that you will feel empathy with Joe's story, and after all you'll see that the movie was nothing but a true statement of the life of woman who's actions is guided by sexuality, in this case I would like to point that she's like Samantha( from sexy and the city), a woman who sex experiences and pleasure it's above love, but in Joe's case she feels bad in order of society rules that break her. Have cleared that this movie is not porn. I must say I found part I very poetic, I liked the way that Lars Von Trier actually related Joe's experiences with music, fishing, literature and religion and created metaphors with it. Though, a lot of people preferred the second part, I liked the first one the best, the delicacy of Joe's feelings in the screenplay at this part really got me. The second part is more realistic, after all you can't aspect to live a fairytale for ever. It shows the despair of a woman used to her strong sexuality feeling the first sines of her vitality fail. And as addicted to a drug, she's begun a road the leads her to destruction. At this plot the plot became extremely logical, and some of the sentimentalism was lost to me, in several scenes of Joe's suffering. Now, the ending. I have to say it was disappointing, yet people say it was likely, I didn't like it at all. It's completely predictable. When I saw Selligman leave the room and comeback it became clear what he were to do and it broke my heart. A strong character as him, be stereotyped at the way was totally unfair to him. Anyway it wasn't at all a disaster, as I liked Joe's decision about her life, and the fact she killed Selligman, after all if there is a gun in the story it must be used. My score for this movie is 7. Oh, and you must see it, if you got at least gotten a bit interested about the plot. I can tell it worth seeing.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
153,matthewrosa27,How It should've Ended,8,7 March 2014,"I love this journey and will not spoil anything except for how I believe Lars Von Trier should have ended the film in a fashion that would've satisfied many of the detractors.****Dont read the following if you haven't seen both films****Joe should've had sex with Seligman at the end knowing that he was a Asexual/virgin and after she was done got up and left his place. Once outside on the street Joe should have met up with B where she awarded Joe with the bag of candy for winning the game they played when they were young teens. However now instead of the train they played the game on a world stage. At this point run all the flashbacks that set up how this entire story was a ""pick up line"" for the 70yr old Asexual/virgin. It would've made much more sense than the Rape/Murder pretentious moral scenario BS.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II

I am still mind-blown after I finished watching it a few moments ago. Sure it has a lot of nude and explicit scenes, but to be honest, the story is what makes it almost brilliant. The secret is to WATCH BOTH VOLUMES, not just one of them, otherwise you are wasting your time. I won't be posting any spoilers, don't worry, but I will tell you this : unlike the people that criticize the movie for being just lame porn ( they are probably too young to see beyond the explicit content scenes ), I enjoyed the story ( slow as it was ), the plot with all its twists , the awkward situations and of course I am still trying to recover from the brilliant ending! If you focus and lose yourself in the story, you will appreciate the movie for its well written script and intelligent directing.

I had no idea that so many recognizable, amazing actors were featured with the best of the best being the actress who played the older version of Joe. I recall seeing her years ago as Jane Eyre and thought she was incredible. Superb acting performances throughout volume 2 (unfortunately, I did not realize there is a volume 1....so that is yet to be viewed). The casting was spectacular and incredibly authentic and believable all the way from Joe to even P. It was Artsy, smart, at times sad, and a totally believable look into the ""underground"" sex world. I also loved how the movie diverged into completely different areas of Joe's life regarding her ""work."" It wasn't gratuitous in any way. It just worked! Through and through.

157,javiersartre2013,If you hate this movie means the world is absolutely perfect for you. Still Happy,10,14 September 2014,"We live in a world where the truth and even ourselves are systematical constructed. You'll never find something interesting about this movie because you are not allowed to think for yourself. In fact, you don't even know who you are, because something (not somebody)build ""the good and the evil"", what thinks shall make you feel pride and why is fair to be punished by the justice. But ¿What is justice? Punish someone for what he did. I prefer to be honest. Justice is Revenge disguising something cruel in a way it looks fair, natural ¿Human? I am lucky. First because there is no reason to punish me. But better than this is one thing: ""I see"". Of course this movie is disturbing. And don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying you are going to be nice things. After all, we live Here? I say: 1) Don't try to be like any people performed in this movie. No matter what you think or feel, it's no legal; 2) If you are ""good people who fight for your rights and the human race... forget it; 3) But if you want to see what LVT put on the table...

158,jimbobeach64,Are we absolutely sure it was Jo that shot Seligman?,7,23 January 2015,"Overall I thought both movies were pretty intriguing. The tone was right, I enjoyed the historical references and cutaways, and I also liked the fact that Jo wasn't overly beautiful or vixen-like. I was enjoying both movies immensely (except for the awful performance and appalling accent of Shia L.) until the ending. Felt like a big ""Eff you"" to the audience. That said, I am not 100% convinced it was Jo that shot Seligman, and not the other way around. The camera goes black, there's a struggle, a gunshot, then we hear SOMEONE ZIPPING UP AN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING, and that same person running out of the room. My recollection was that Jo had on a skirt. I don't recall if there was a zipper on it or not, but when I heard the zipper being pulled up, my immediate reaction was that Seligman wrestled the gun away from her in the dark, and shot her, then put his PANTS on, zipped them up, and ran out of the room.

The fabric weaved in this story of Joe's life portrayed honest and depth few reveal of themselves. Childhood holds so many of these on the edge of discussion topics we all faced but never talk about. The honesty was fresh!Often its the sexual acts done in silence that we push far from our minds and act as if never took place..only lashing out in anger when someone dares flash a light to its reaches.

162,budwheat,Much Deeper Than The Sex,8,1 January 2017,"In much the same way that Meloncholia was considered an ""art"" film, I see Nymphomaniac II in the same genre. From the beautiful irony of Joe's tale being analyzed by a geeky virgin, to the juxtapositions of deep emotions with raw, graphic sex and abuse, the movie pulls the viewer in many directions. The casting is also somewhat ironic as well. Shia's real-life wife being cast in scenes without him, Christian Slater as a caring father of a tortured daughter, and Dafoe as a caring substitute father but in reality a vile business mentor, all reek of clever casting. Music and excellent cinematography enhance the capture of the viewer in a tale of psychological importance. Not a film for the shy, and not a film for enjoying shallow characters. It's very deep and might even be therapeutic for some.",Nymphomaniac - Vol. II
