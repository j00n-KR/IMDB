0,bkoganbing,What I Did For Love,7,17 December 2007,"In Spy Game, Robert Redford plays a spy with feelings. He's risen high in the Central Intelligence Agency and looking towards a nice retirement on some tropical beach. But Brad Pitt who he brought into the agency straight from being a sniper in Vietnam has gone off on an unauthorized mission that's not something the spy people usually deal in. He's gotten himself caught in a Chinese prison and is ready to be executed in 24 hours.The CIA has written him off, but Redford hasn't not by any means. As he plays agency politics, he also reminisces about his 16 year relationship with Pitt from Vietnam in 1975 until the capture which takes place in 1991.It's a particularly embarrassing situation for the agency because the president is just about to embark on a good will mission. More so because if you remember the president in 1991 was one George H.W. Bush who was both a former CIA director and Ambassador to China. Spy Game is a good, not great film. Unfortunately the film does not develop any secondary characters at all which in Redford's scenes at the Langley, Virginia headquarters would have been of vital importance. Spy Game is strictly a star vehicle.Why is Redford doing this, it could be any number of reasons, not the least of which is a not too subtle gay relationship he's having with Pitt. Also whereas spies are disposable people, and folks know that going into that field of employment, Redford is still operating as a military man from Vietnam who has a great distaste for not going back for his men on a given mission.Why has Pitt got himself in this jackpot in the first place. For that you have to see the film.",Spy Game
1,Leofwine_draca,An intelligent political thriller,7,30 December 2016,"Here's an atypical but enthralling thriller from sure-hand director Tony Scott which plays out most of its tale in various flashbacks, but is held together through an excellent leading turn from Robert Redford. Redford is an ageing CIA agent and on his last day of work before retirement (gee, where have we heard that one before?) he learns that his young protégé has been captured for spying in a Chinese prison and is due to be executed the following morning. Much of the film consists of him relating previous experiences and adventures to his superiors as the clock ticks down towards his partner's imminent death. Whilst this might not sound to be very interesting viewing, the flashbacks are invariably exciting and involve lots of secrecy, death, and open warfare in some cases (an excellent interlude in Beirut for example), elements all woven together well.The present scenes of Redford using his own contacts and methods to help his captured chum are excellently portrayed and even if the film comes a little loose towards the ending, it still engages the senses through the quality of the acting. Here's a film with some fleshed-out characters brought to vivid life through the strong actors playing them. Redford and Pitt are excellent in their two very different roles, and we also get strong support from Catherine McCormack as Pitt's love interest and Stephen Dillane, excellently snide as an enemy of Redford's at the intelligence agency. Flashily directed by Scott and never lulling for a moment, this is an exciting and intelligent movie with plenty of incident and dynamism to recommend it.",Spy Game
2,SnoopyStyle,Tony Scott keeps trying to make an action movie out of this,6,22 May 2015,"In 1991, CIA agent Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) is captured trying to help Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack) escape Chinese PLA Su Chou prison. Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) on his last day before retirement tries to navigate the politically sensitive situation. He recruited sniper Bishop back in '75 Vietnam for a mission.Director Tony Scott is making a slick espionage movie with two of the greatest stars in the universe. This should be better but it's only passable. Scott is pulling out all the editing tricks to artificially juice up the excitement. I'm not sure it fits the material but it's perfectly watchable. It wants to be an action movie when it's more of a tense chess game.",Spy Game
3,kosmasp,It's not a game,9,7 July 2021,"Or is it? Maybe it is easier to ... play it, if you consider it a game? One thing is for sure, Tony Scott is a masterful player ... behind the camera. You can tell with this movie, how he likes to shoot movies and how he likes to create tension, even in a simple scene, where Redford is only holding a cup of coffee and going from one room to another ... insert, camera moves with him, towards him, cut little snippets in and make it seem like something urgent ... masterclass in shooting and editing I'd say.But that is not all we have here. You also have two wonderful actors ... two people who surely admire each other and play off each other very well. Even if their characters may not agree on many things ... there is some level of respect even in the movie and their playing off each other.The Spy Game is not something that can be seen lightly ... and something that plays with human life. Where certain scenarios are considered wins, even if a lot has been lost ... you'll know once you see this. I'm surprised I never had seen this before the other day ... but there is only so many movies one can watch, right?",Spy Game
4,gavin6942,A Perfect Role for Redford,7,7 March 2016,"Retiring CIA agent Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) recalls his training of Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) while working against agency politics to free him from his Chinese captors.This is the perfect role for Robert Redford. After ""Day of the Condor"" and before ""Captain America"", this is a great early-2000s spy thriller and Redford has distinguished himself in those roles. This seems like it would pair well with ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"". They are both spies looking back on their career trying to figure things out. Different, yet similar.Pitt is also a great choice because he is in many ways a younger Redford in his personality and presence. Will that continue as Pitt ages? Perhaps. If anything, he has become a bigger player than even Redford managed to be.",Spy Game
5,Tweekums,A Solid spy thriller,7,5 June 2017,"This spy thriller opens in China in 1991 as an ambulance approaches a prison. Once there its occupants start inoculating the prisoners. One of the 'Doctors' fakes his own death before trying to break out one of the prisoners; he is nearly gets out but is caught at the last moment. It emerges that he is CIA operative Tom Bishop but the agency isn't keen to help him even when the Chinese announce that he is to be executed the next day his operation wasn't authorised and acknowledging him could threaten an upcoming trade deal.As the CIA decide what to do they call in Nathan Muir, a case officer who is retiring that day, because he was the man who recruited Bishop. As he tells them key details about Bishop we see flashbacks of his recruitment in Vietnam and operations in East Berlin and Beirut which ultimately explain just what he was doing in China. We also see Muir making moves to help rescue Bishop without the knowledge of his superiors.This is a solid spy thriller even if its central conceit is a little far-fetched. It was interesting that between the opening, where Bishop was captured, until his ultimate rescue we only glimpsed him in captivity; he wasn't a 'super-agent' like Bond or Bourne. Instead the flashbacks show him in action where he is forced to make compromises that ultimately leads to his disillusion. Brad Pitt does an impressive job as Bishop but it is Robert Redford who stands out in the role of Muir; not an action man but a plausible character who uses contacts to save Bishop rather than getting in physical danger himself that doesn't mean there is no tension though; there is the feeling that he could be caught and if he was Bishop would certainly be doomed. The action we do see is mostly plausible even if the final rescue requires some suspension of disbelief as it involves US forces actually going into China. There are some flaws that are pretty basic such as references to a US Embassy in Honk Kong rather than a consulate and referring to 'Hong Kong, China' when Hong Kong was a British Dependent Territory in 1991 silly early mistakes that make one wonder what other details are wrong. Overall this might not be a must see film I'd still recommend it to fans of the genre.",Spy Game
6,blanche-2,Redford seeks to free Pitt from a Chinese prison,7,28 January 2010,"""Spy Game"" is a 2001 directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.Redford plays Nathan Muir, a CIA man getting ready to retire. On his last day, he finds out that one of his operatives, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) is in a Chinese prison awaiting execution.After a series of meetings, in which he recounts his relationship with Bishop, including his recruitment, it occurs to him that because of an upcoming trade conference, the CIA is going to let Bishop be executed.I remember this film receiving horrific reviews when it was released. In fact, with two great stars and top direction, it's not bad at all. There's a lot of action, and the complicated story, which could have been a muddled mess, is well told.I believe Redford is retired now, but thankfully, he had years of making wonderful contributions to film.",Spy Game
7,Quinoa1984,Nothing great but it's atmosphere and characterizations are perfect,7,22 November 2001,"Tony Scott's latest suspense film is a on and off crackerjack suspense thriller with covert ops, down to the clock thrills and other good things. Sometimes it's slow but it's never intolerable with Redford and Pitt delivering fine performances (I didn't know Redford could still act this good) as two spies, one retiring which is Redford, and the other (Pitt) is in a Chinese prison in detainment for espionage and while trying to save him in a 24 hour period Redford goes through their history together for a group of suspicious CIA types. Some fine and definitely appropriate cinematography by Daniel Mindel and a good all around feel (the atmosphere is perfect as I mentioned earlier, as that the film creates situations and scenes where your eyes don't want to wander the screen for a second in fear of missing something that could be important) delivered by Scott and company; not anything that will win awards, but it is worthwhile for adults and other mature folks who might actualy go against the tide of Harry Potter and see this while the kids see that.

8,wes-connors,Blonde on Blonde,5,7 June 2009,"""When a top-secret, unauthorized mission goes bad, CIA agent Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) is captured - and sentenced to die. With just 24 hours to get him out alive, Bishop's boss Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) must battle enemies abroad and the system inside the CIA to save his friend. Now, the clock is ticking and the race is on as the deadliest game of all explodes into the spectacular, adrenaline-fueled pulse-pounding action thrill ride,"" according to the film's official synopsis.Tony Scott's ""Spy Game"" is a good-looking , mostly enjoyable espionage thriller; but, it fails to take full advantage of the inspired casting of Mr. Redford with Mr. Pitt. The two men aren't given much to work with, but manage to convey a (presumably) father/son relationship. The best characterization comes from Redford's interaction with sturdy secretary Marianne Jean-Baptiste (as Gladys); she almost single-handedly gives Redford (and, by extension, Pitt) heart.The timeline and character ages do not seem credible; 1975, the most plausible year for Redford and Pitt to have met during the Vietnam War, is where the film begins, chronologically. But, Redford and Pitt haven't changed much, in appearance, in the ""present"" setting of 1991 - they both sport beautiful heads of Hollywood hair, though. Catherine McCormack, as Pitt's love interest, contributes to an unconvincing ""love story"" subplot. And, it's nice to see Larry Bryggman in feature film.***** Spy Game (11/19/01) Tony Scott ~ Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, Catherine McCormack, Marianne Jean-Baptiste",Spy Game

10,sunwarrior13,One Of The Best Spy Thrillers,10,10 October 2011,"Spy Game is a spy film thriller that stars Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. It was shown in 2001 - the same year the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists.The plot involves CIA operative Nathan Muir,played by the multi-talented Redford,is on the brink of retirement.He then finds out that his protégé,Tom Bishop,played excellently by Brad Pitt,has been arrested in for espionage. No stranger to the machinations of the CIA's top echelon, Muir hones all his skills and irreverent manner in order to find a way to help Bishop. As he embarks on his mission,he recalls how he recruited and trained the young Bishop, at that time a sergeant in Vietnam, their turbulent times together as operatives. The film was masterfully directed by Tony Scott. This is one of the best films I have ever seen especially for a spy thriller.It works at all levels.The story was suspenseful from beginning to end.It was fast paced and interesting from beginning to end.All major and minor characters were interesting.The film has a lot of intelligence in terms of the story and characters involved.The acting was also exceptional.Aside from Pitt and Redford,it is also worth mentioning that Catherine McCormack,Stephen Dillane,Larry Bryggman and Marianne Jean- Baptiste provided excellent performances as Elizabeth Hadley,Charles Harker,CIA Deputy Director Troy Folger and Muir's secretary,Gladys with a lot of smarts and craft. Overall,the film simply works at all level for it was not simply a spy thriller but it also provides us an insight on how the CIA works and the insight on an emotional spy.Highly recommended for movie viewers who desires intelligent action thrillers.It definitely deserves a 10/10 rating.",Spy Game
11,jotix100,Deja Vu?,6,22 November 2001,"Haven't we seen Redford in this sort of thing before? He was much better in Three Days of the Condor than here. It's hard to think that in the span of 24 hours Brad Pitt's fate will be resolved in a farfetched way, but given the fact that this CIA agent played by Redford can accomplish so much in a cinematic day, outsmarting the same organization and colleagues he used to work with, it's a wonder the Agency can survive at all . That there could be such dumb people employed by the government who will leave their badges and ID's laying around, could only happen in the minds of screenwriters Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata. What was the point of the Berlin rooftop scene, was Tony Scott trying his hand at a commercial for outdoor furniture? We only hope the character portrayed by Redford is living well as the security manager for a hotel in the Bahamas after his retirement and that Tom, the Brad Pitt character, is finally allowed to settle down in Sedona doing spiritual readings after all he goes through in this movie. Poor guy, he must have gotten paid not too many millions to appear in this film.",Spy Game
12,anaconda-40658,All Game. All War.,9,3 February 2016,"Spy Game (2001): Dir: Tony Scott / Cast: Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, Catherine McCormack, David Hemmings, Stephen Dillane: Superb film about our attitude towards violence and danger. Shown mainly through flashbacks regarding the relationship between Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. When an operation goes wrong an agency wishes to give reason for the Chinese to execute Pitt whom is captured and tortured. Redford acts on behalf of Pitt and is questioned but underneath he is thinking beyond them. We learn that they met in Vietnam and were involved in many combat operations. Pitt became involved with a woman whom Redford viewed as bad news. While formula in structure the film is entertaining and directed with insight by Tony Scott who also made True Romance and The Hunger. Here he does a war film that is a far cry to that overrated farce he made called Top Gun. Redford is clever in his dealings around the corrupt officials who are applying pressure. Pitt is seen mainly through torture segments but flashbacks broaden his back story. Catherine McCormack plays the mysterious woman involved with Pitt whom Redford cannot quite trust. David Hemmings is a fine actor but wasted in a flat role. The film is well made visually but its message doesn't seem to be as played up as the action. The result is an insightful and entertaining film at best. Score: 9 ½ / 10",Spy Game
13,HotToastyRag,Team Brad versus Team Bob,4,25 September 2017,"The title of Spy Game is perfectly suited to the film; half of it is an action thriller, and the other half is a cheesy comedy. If you watch the preview, you'll hear tons of one-liners flying back and forth between Robert Redford and his younger self, Brad Pitt. If you're chuckling, go ahead and rent it. If you think it's silly, skip this movie and stick to Three Days of the Condor.Bob and Brad are CIA agents; the former trained and taught the latter. The most memorable line from the film is when Brad gestures for Bob to go ahead in a shoot-out: ""Age before beauty."" This line demonstrates the real problem with the film. Let's face it, you're either a Robert Redford fan who thinks Brad Pitt is a young upstart, or you're a Brad Pitt fan who thinks Robert Redford should retire. It's not possible to root for both of them! So, in the film, when Brad gets captured by the Chinese and Bob sets out to rescue him, you're either thinking, ""Stay home, don't risk your neck for that kid!"" or, ""You don't need any help from that old timer!"" My advice is to watch the preview. That's as good as it's going to get. Then, rent your favorite film from whichever blond beauty you're partial to. I know what I'm watching tonight, old sport!",Spy Game

It's how the game plays you.',10,30 June 2013,"Some movies get better with age - just like the two main actors of this splendid thriller, Robert Redford (now 77) and Brad Pitt (now 50). SPY GAME as written by Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata and directed with distinction by Tony Scott reminds us how thrilling films of this ilk can be without the need for computer generated aliens, or vampires, or werewolves, or zombies or outrageous extraterrestrial effects, etc. The dialogue is smart, balanced with humor when appropriate, and played with a fine assemblage of actors who know how to terrify us simply by telling a visual story.CIA operative Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is on the brink of retirement when he finds out that his protégé Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been arrested in China for espionage. No stranger to the machinations of the CIA's top echelon, Muir hones all his skills and irreverent manner in order to find a way to free Bishop. As he embarks on his mission to free Bishop, Muir recalls how he recruited and trained the young rookie, at that time a sergeant in Vietnam, their turbulent times together as operatives and the woman who threatened their friendship. There is of course the requisite female agent (Catherine McCormack), a top member of the CIA (Stephen Dillane) who allows us to see how corrupt that organization can be, and the ever grounded secretary (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) to remind us that the people involved in this world wide intrigue are really just human beings - even if they misbehave in their jobs.Made in 2001 this film remains a skillful winner - just the ticket for watching in the stifling heat of summer time. And it is such a pleasure to watch the magic that Redford and Pitt weave. Highly recommended and it is so VERY timely in 2013! Grady Harp",Spy Game

16,secondtake,"Sharp, sizzling, pastiche of an action film...never flags!",7,11 June 2010,"Spy Game (2001)Two generations of handsome (handsome!) men in a fast (very fast) game of espionage from the inside. It'll keep you up, sometimes at the edge of your seat, and sweeping along in an international free-for-all that manages to go from Vietnam to Beirut to Langley (of course) to China (in a nod to the new world order). If it's not brilliant, and feels at times forced, and if you sometimes think, okay, here's another well-used twist, you still will be impressed by all the great scenes and all the high energy explosions and most of all by the high stakes subterfuge.And in good John Le Carre fashion (if you don't know who he is, get out one of his better books and find great spy storytelling with heart), the main characters matter to each other for personal reasons. As much as this is about a rampage through some hot spots in CIA history, plain and simple, it's about honor, professional respect, admiration for extraordinary abilities, and friendship. It's also about the loner bucking the system for the good of love, and for a somewhat clear conscience. That's as appealing (and American?) as it gets, and it is partly why I gave it a little extra attention. Brad Pitt and Robert Redford (the two handsome dudes mentioned) are different kinds of consummate pros, and they need each other in different ways that makes for a distant, sporadic, but believable partnership. This is told with a multi pronged series of flashbacks that is both fabulous in its visual and kinetic intensity and unwieldy in its construction. First they show Redford at a fancy strategy room table with other men, then he starts to explain something in the past, and then it flashes back. Over and over. Not the smoothest approach, but functional.Ignore that, and ignore the fact that you don't ever quite get emotionally into their current crisis because it is so fractured and indistinct (we don't quite know who to root for or why), and you have a dynamic, sizzling bit of action thriller movie. It's a man's club, this CIA thing, in the eyes of this very male director Tony Scott, who rarely gives women much to do in his movies, from Top Gun to the Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, but this is one of Scott's best.",Spy Game

But I know for certain it's nothing like James Bond movies. I have an idea that the spy business may be a bit more like this film portrays. So for realness, I'll give the plot of this film relatively high marks.And, the acting is top notch. Was Robert Redford ever not at least ""very good"" in a film? He's totally believable here. Same goes for Brad Pitt. Totally believable. As far as the supporting cast, you won't recognize many, but they do their jobs well.One cautionary note: This is a complicated plot, and one you have to pay close attention to, or you'll miss a lot.

18,tabuno,Its Own Unique Espionage Thriller,9,13 January 2019,"3 March 2016. Rarely does a spy movie come out that offers both action thrills and substantive mind games. What makes this spy movie unique is its use of action as a backdrop to the real cerebral activities going on. This is a mental movie, like a mystery genre but the mystery isn't who done it, but how and if it will be done. The use of flashbacks are superlative in connecting the movie with concurrent past and present action going on. The audience is offered a brilliant sequence of simultaneous stories that interweave in profuse delight. The storyline is so straight forward that the narrative is allowed to become more qualitative than quantitative. The emotional tension begins at the very start of the movie and continues through out. The story depicts real espionage tactics, allows the audience to experience betrayal, loss, and human connections... This is a humanistic and penetrating look at espionage and its impact on people, not a superficial action thriller.",Spy Game

Abandoned by the agency because of political concerns, its Muir's job to try to help his colleague.This movie is not excellent but it was within what I expected. The pace is good, there is a good tension and a very nice suspense throughout the movie. There are also some action scenes, punctually. Nevertheless, the story told has flaws and problems with logic, which become increasingly evident as the film moves to its conclusion. The ending is truly unlikely.Robert Redford is the actor who best disentangled himself in this movie. He is a veteran and the character is tailored for him. Without ever losing his pose and composure, he has a very good collaboration with Brad Pitt. The dialogues are good and work well, especially between the two actors. What didn't go well was the movie's romantic subplot, which is bad considering the relevance that will be given to it. Simply, that part of the story was never credible.Good photography, good sets and costumes, a discreet soundtrack, good sound and visual effects, some good special effects, used with moderation. It's not the movie we're going to see because of its technicalities, despite meeting Hollywood's standards.

23,jimbo-53-186511,Patchy thriller where the good slightly outweighs the bad,6,24 December 2017,"Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is about to retire from the CIA when he is given a tip-off that an old colleague Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) has been captured and is being held in a Chinese prison. Upon discovering that Bishop will be executed within the next 24 hours and with the CIA seemingly being prepared to do nothing about it, Muir takes it upon himself to do his utmost to get Bishop freed within the 24 hour deadline...To all intents and purposes this is a fairly good action/thriller with plenty of Tony Scott's trademark touches; quick and flashy editing, some decent shootouts and explosions. It isn't all style though and what you actually get here is a reasonably good story - it's one that is well-developed and through Redford's narration we do get to learn quite a bit about Muir and Bishop (there's certainly enough here to become invested in the story). One other positive with this film comes with Muir running his own 'operation' in order to try to facilitate Bishop's escape (this in itself makes part of the story exciting and throws in a couple of interesting plot turns).Part of the problem with this film is that it is a bit plot heavy and crammed with far too much exposition - whilst it all serves a purpose and nicely pieces everything together in the end I couldn't help but feel that a little trimming here and there wouldn't hurt. It's also fair to say that clocking in at just over 2 hours it is a little on the long side.Redford and Pitt are both solid here and they are both developed quite well as characters, but the downside of this is that they aren't given a great deal of screen time together meaning that they are never really given much of an opportunity to build up any kind of rapport together.Still when the focus is on Tony Scott doing his 'thing' and Redford running his own operation the film rarely disappoints.

25,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Very underrated Tony Scott film. Love it.,9,12 May 2016,"Tony Scott's Spy Game is a kinetic yet heartfelt espionage thriller that sees the director maintain considerable shards of his assaulting sensory overdrive of style, whilst pausing along the way for a story that is really rooted in the personal story of the bond and friendship between two men. A lot of his films are predominantly visual and auditory, a bullet train of sound and fury, with plot and characterization as passengers onboard. Here those elements are cogs in the machine, resulting in a very touching, extremely exciting outing and perhaps the director's most overlooked piece. Robert Redford used to be the younger, more naive faction in a lot of cinematic pairings, especially with Paul Newman. Here he flips the coin, taking on the grizzled mantle of both father figure and mentor to Brad Pitt. Pitt is Tom Bishop, an operative taken under the wing of veteran agent Nathan D. Muir (Redford). Nathan no doubt sees some of himself in the lad, and takes a shine to him, grooming him with all the skills and cunning that a lifetime in the business has given him. Life throws curveballs though, and more often than not they involve love. Bishop has gone rogue in an attempt to rescue relief worker Elizabeth Hadley (the brilliant Catherine McCormack, who needs to be in more movies) from a Chinese prison. In his eagerness he is captured, leaving Muir to make some tough decisions, pull some hidden cards and use all of his talent and resources to extract them. Now in many films like this there would be several blistering action set pieces to show how it's done. Scott instead chooses to give Redford the intellectual grit and subversive genius to pull hidden strings and come up with a wicked fun solution that is endlessly more satisfying than an explosion ridden shock and awe campaign. His struggle to get his friend back is laced with flashbacks of his training, with a 70's flavour that feels authentic and writing that lovingly builds the blocks of their dynamic. Stephen Dillane provides wonderfully understated work as a quietly smarmy CIA prick, and watch for a quick appearance from the great Charlotte Rampling. To see Scott's frenetic aesthetic hired for a script that takes its time and plays out less like a conventional thriller and more like the paced, elliptical spy thrillers of years past (vaguely reminiscent of aspects of Le Carré) is a somewhat rare treat. Terrific thriller with Redford at his best, highly, highly recommended.",Spy Game
26,robertemerald,Early and very exciting example of flash-back narration,10,23 February 2020,"Spy Game was using the flash-back technique of telling a story way before it became the vogue it is today. Basically the story is a series vignettes which manages to cover some of the defining scenarios one normally associates with spying and the CIA. Each is phenomenal. It is true that the CIA comes away with some probably undeserved bruising. This is a movie though, and as a movie it's so effective. This was one of the first movies I saw of Robert Redford in his 'second' career as a star. At the time we had all missed him. Spy Game was quite a cannon of a way to re-emerge. He slotted in perfectly with Brad Pitt, perhaps an equivalent star for his day. The movie is no slouch as obviously all the bells and whistles were pulled out in terms of sets, locations, extras, lighting, production values, etc, and most if not all of the support players have gone on to illustrious careers of their own. Wonderful movie, as gripping as Bourne or Bond, and in a masterclass of its own.",Spy Game
27,triple8,"Redford, in a great performance, makes this movie what it is..",7,15 March 2004,"Spy Game is an interesting movie. The first half of the movie is incredible. This is for two reasons: the main one being Robert Redford, in a performance that garners 10 out of 10, he is just incredible in this role and almost singlehandedly makes this movie better then average.The second reason is the electric soundtrack heard constantly that is quite apropriate for this movie and never fails to keep the movie tense, exciting and involving. The problems start, however in the second half of the film.There, the music is noticeably less, the explosions grow quite frequent and a minor love story is thrown into the equation. Things also start to get confusing. This is a very tough movie to follow, many times I had no idea what the heck was going on(and still don't.) In spite of those flaws, however, there is something (strangely) likable and compelling about spy game, the electric atmosphere and Redford's intensity make you want to see it through and know what happens next.Pitt's good here, though better in other roles quite honestly, Redford clealy steals the show here.This is a movie that, as mentioned by many, could have been done a lot better. I'd still call it a good movie though, in spite of it's flaws. It grips you from the start and is pretty well paced even though the first half is clearly better then the second.If nothing else, see it for Redford's incredible performance, he's as good here as anything I've ever seen him in and his character will suck you in from the beginning.When I think a movie's really good I give it an 8 or above-when I think it's alright but not great it gets a 7. Spy game is not an 8 but somehow is above a 7 as well. I guess I'd rate this around a 7.7 or so. If you can get through the feeling of ""what's going on?"" that comes up quite frequently, you can become really involved in the atmosphere and action packed story line.",Spy Game
28,Spleen,"Some decent material, directed with pretentious stupidity",6,18 May 2002,"""Spy Game"" looks as though it could have been directed by Tony Scott's brother Ridley.  That wasn't a compliment.There IS the kernel of a good movie here  - we see it when Nathan is training Tom in the ways of spycraft, handing out snap tests (find out something about that woman walking a dog; bluff your way onto one of the balconies of that building within five minutes), telling us secrets about what spies do that are so intriguing it doesn't matter if they're true or false.  If Scott can't see that THIS material is gold, while everything else he has to work with is lead with the occasional streak of silver or iron, there's no hope for him.But in order for any of this material to shine, we have to be able to SEE it - and all we could see were pretentious, arty gimmicks, thrown together with no sense of rhythm or style.  They're not even GOOD pretentious, arty gimmicks.  Here's what passes for flair in a Scott film: when we're told that the Chinese plan to execute Tom in just 24 hours, Robert Redford is frozen as a black and white photo with the legend ""8:02pm"" printed underneath; this gesture, like most gestures, is accompanied by the metallic whoosh of a steel tub brushing the side of a wind tunnel, JUST IN CASE WE MISSED THE POINT.  Throughout the day we see more such photos of Redford with similar legends: 2:30pm, 11:34pm, or whatever; one of these photo legends even has in brackets beneath it: ""execution at 8:00am"" - JUST IN CASE WE'D MISSED THE POINT.  The camera sweeps in when it should stay still,flies through the sky in fast motion when it has nothing better to do, zooms in on the trivial, and from start to finish the film is the wearying sequence of cut! cut! cut! that's the first sign of poverty of imagination on at least SOMEONE'S part.  Scott can cut all he wants; it won't disguise that none of his footage and none of his gimmickry has any life.  (Some directors can take equally vapid stuff and give it a soul.)  He has no ear for music, either.  The score is unspeakably dreadful.It's the kind of film which starts out looking a little bit lame and within a mere five, or three, or even just two years, looks crashingly, obviously, ludicrously lame.",Spy Game
29,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,High Gloss Hackery,3,29 November 2020,"Tony Scott was a director of slick commercials and shlock music videos. Somehow he got a job directing movies. So no surprise he turned out slick, high gloss shlock like The Hunger, Top Gun, Days of Thunder, The Last Boy Scout, The Fan, Enemy of the State, and Spy Game. I mean, that's a murderers row of loud, forgettable, empty-calorie garbage right there.Spy Game has a setup. What follows is a two-hour music video nominally featuring a globe-trotting, trouble-makinjg spy played by Brad Pitt, whose is mostly limited to sporting different hairstyles. And his mentor, super-annuated Robert Redford, trying to save him from a nasty end at the hands of the Communist Chinese.I hope the guy who designed the sound for it got paid well. He's the only guy who earned his money. He did a good job of covering up for the fact that it's a super-dull, content-free, talkie movie masquerading as a spy thriller.",Spy Game
30,philip_vanderveken,Not for people who love James Bond movies.,8,8 October 2004,"Sometimes you get the feeling, just by watching the cover of the DVD that the movie isn't going to be any good. That's exactly what happened here. I never felt like buying or even renting it, because it looked like a typical brainless James Bond movie with a lot of explosions and stupid gadgets (sorry for the people who love James Bond movies, it's just not my style). But I have to admit that this time my feeling was completely wrong.It was shown on television on a Saturday night. I didn't think I would like it but I taped it anyway, because the reviews in the magazines were quite good. Today I didn't have much better to do so I watched it and I was pleasantly surprised by it. The story isn't unique. A CIA agent, one day away from his retirement, tries to save a young colleague out of the hands of the Chinese. He was captured when trying to liberate the woman he loves from a military prison. He's being tortured by the Chinese and he'll be executed the next 24 hours. Nothing new I hear you say, a typical Hollywood script you think. True, but Robert Redfort and Brad Pitt really acted very well and the director, Tony Scott, did an excellent job by using flash backs all the time. At first these flash backs made the movie a bit confusing, but as the story progresses it really gives you a better idea on who these people are, what they have in common, why they are in that particular situation ...All in all this is an intelligent spy movie, who will not be liked by everyone (especially not by people who want to see plenty of action shots with a lot of guns and explosions), but which certainly appealed to me. I give it a 7.5/10.",Spy Game

The film focuses on Redford's lone efforts to arrange Pitt's rescue, recounting in flashback his relationship with the former sniper from his initial recruitment and training, to daring operations behind enemy lines around the world spanning almost twenty years.It's comic-book stuff and looks purpose-built for both Redford and Pitt (Redford indisputably the headline act), with minor roles for David Hemmings as an ambassador to Hong Kong, Shane Rimmer and Charlotte Rampling as a former spy and love interest to Redford.Long and meandering, there's not much sense about the proceedings and yet it's fairly engaging material nonetheless with some effective action sequences, occasional humour (usually at the expense of pompous CIA boss Dillane) and even a moment or two of pathos as Pitt reveals a softer core that predictably jeopardises his position as both the master spy and fractures his friendship with the more pragmatic Redford.

33,zsenorsock,This Condor Won't Fly,4,4 December 2001,"When Brad Pitt recently said ""I am completely bored with myself in films."" you get the feeling he must've meant this one in particular. The direction is slow and plodding, the story is both dull and ludicrous at the same time, and the filmmakers are sloppy with the details. They don't pay attention to them and they hope you won't either.The film begins with it being the last day of work for the old pro (Robert Redford)at the CIA. He learns that an agent and good friend (Brad Pitt) that he personally recruited and trained, has been captured by the Chicoms and is scheduled to be executed in 24 hours. Of course, the CIA disavows any knowledge of Pitt and is willing to let him go down, so it is up to Redford to try and find a way to save his friend.The picture is far less interesting than this might sound. Told in a series of dull flashbacks from 1991, the filmmakers believe a little soft focus is all it needs to turn Robert Redford's increasingly craggy features from a man of  63 to a man of 47 again, and Brad Pitt from a man of 32 to one of 16? Wait, that can't be right. I guess he must be playing 36, so he was 20 in the flashbacks. Okay, but none of that explains how he manages to wear the blue baseball cap of the San Diego Padres in Beirut in 1985 while the Padres wore brown caps at the time. The blue caps were not introduced until 1994. But no matter. That is just a small example of the filmmaker's' aversion to getting the details right.A much larger example comes when Redford is questioned by his superiors about Pitt in a secure room where everything said is taped and transcribed. However, Redford successfully gets around this by talking on the phone! All this security and the phones are not monitored? Please. I have better security. Anyway, I think you get the idea. It's really too bad, because both Redford and Pitt are muy macho and good actors to boot. It's too bad they picked such a forgettable project to team together in. There's not even any good hotties to distract one from this slow motion machine.If Brad wants to stop boring people with his films, I would advise him to look for better scripts. For Bobby Redford, I would advise him to talk to his old pal Paul Newman about allowing himself to play older characters. Newman has managed a nice transition from hunky leading man to older leading man, and it is a transition Redford is overdue for.Finally, I advise you to skip this movie entirely and go rent ""Three Days of the Condor"", an infinitely better Robert Redford-CIA movie he made in 1975, ironically the same year this movie has him training Pitt to be a CIA operative in Vietnam.  In that movie, Redford is a CIA agent code named Condor who becomes a man on the run when he returns to his New York decoding office after lunch and finds everyone has been murdered. It costars John Houseman, Faye Dunaway Cliff Robertson and Max Von Sydow. It is one of Senor Sock's favorite movies ever that does not star Denise Richards. SenorSock go.to/senor_sock",Spy Game

The dialog especially. It will answer all your questions in the end if you can remember. I watched the movie twice a few months apart and it made lots of sense second time out. The main character shows us just what he did do at the CIA by using his powers to get a friend out of trouble at the same time trying to keep himself out of trouble too. Add to the fact it is his last day at work, so we have time pressures. Working smarter not harder produces tense, thriller action. The actors of course deliver the goods and the director had his heart in his work. Recommend sunflower seeds or popcorn so as not to bite nails during some parts.

If i had to pick the better of the two in this movie it would Redford. His battle , verbaly , with his superiors is the highlight of the film .

One the last day before Redford retires, he discovers his estranged protégé (Brad Pitt) has been captured in mainland China during an abortive, and unauthorized rescue attempt.  Realizing Pitt is to be sacrificed for the sake of US / Chinese trade talks, Redford has 24 hours to clandestinely use government resources and contacts to free Pitt.  Thus, this is more a ""caper"" movie than strictly a ""spy"" film.Much of the story is told in flashback, but this in no way detracts from the suspense.  Redford is remarkable, creating the most lovable S.O.B. I've ever witnessed on screen.  Considering my built-in prejudices against Redford (I usually feel he acts like a narcissistic jerk), this is a special accomplishment.One major quibble: there is virtually no chemistry between Pitt and Catherine McCormick.  This may be due to the story being filtered through Redford's memory.  Nevertheless, it does undercut the film. This is ironical, since a deleted scene shows QUITE A BIT of chemistry between Redford and McCormick.""Spy Game"" is a keeper. I'd give it a ""9"".",Spy Game
41,jon.h.ochiai,Good Game,8,11 December 2001,"Tony Scott's ""Spy Game"" starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt is not exactly what I expected. It's not really an action movie. It's more of a thriller with some interesting insight into the operations of the CIA courtesy of writer Michael Frost Beckner. It's good fun with a lot of star power. On the day of his retirement, Nathan Muir (Redford) discovers that his protégé' and estranged friend, Tom Bishop (Pitt), has been captured in China for espionage and will be executed in 24 hours. Not exactly what 30 year CIA veteran Muir had intended as his swan song. Apparently, Bishop has also gone rogue as an operative. This does not fair well with impending trade status talks with China in 1991. Muir must get his man out, while the CIA ""internal affairs"" man, Charles Harker (an great snake-like Stephen Dillane) is out to trap Muir. Interesting setting is in place. The movie centers on Muir's flashbacks to his relationship with Bishop since he recruited him in Vietnam in 1975. Ultimately, their strained relationship centers around his relationship with a mysterious woman, Elizabeth (Catherine McCormack). Guess what happens to rock bands, happens to CIA operatives. This is also a weaker point of the movie. The strength of the movie is in the mentor relationship between Redford and Pitt. Redford is particularly great as the seen-it-all before Muir who is coaching his charge in how the play The Game and the other game-- life. Pitt brings a energy and humanity to a spy who is ultimately disillusioned by The Game-- he makes believable the evolution. Tony Scott keeps up the pace along with a high tech and grand visual style. The opening sequence of the movie is stunning. Too bad with the structure of the story, Redford and Pitt don't spend more time on the screen together-- something the movie could have used more of.

His mentor and man who trained him, Nathan Muir, is called in urgently to work (it is his last day before retirement) to help unravel a potentially volatile international situation. During all of this Muir thinks back to the days when he trained Bishop and how he turned a soldier who fought with guns in the battlefield into a soldier who fights with wits and deception.Many people seemed to pan this film and it didn't perform well at the box office, but it is nonetheless an engaging thriller. It is perhaps the fact that this is not an action movie as many were led to believe as the word ""spy"" in this movie is much different than say ""James Bond."" The approach here seems like a story out of Robert Ludlum's books with movie based more on the characters and plotting rather than all out spectacle. It shows international espionage in a way that it probably is in real life. A web of deception, lies, trickery, with bursts of violence here and there. Also, suit with that point, the world of espionage isn't really all that glorious. Especially when you take into account that the heroes are, among other things, assassins. They work for a government, they have their personal issues like any other person, but they are essentially to do some very dirty work. Not the most respectable type of human beings, but that's the point. Spywork is dirty work. However, the ending rings of Hollywood more than the rest of the movie would like it to.Also Tony Scott's likeness for visual experimentation seems to have started around here. It is not quite as insane as ""Domino,"" but the constant flashbacks and themes of deception are played out nicely under Scott's often hectic direction. --- 8/10Rated R for violence and profanity",Spy Game

When I was watching this film I got the impression that the CIA, undoubtedly the preeminent espionage organization on the planet, was being glorified for its interference in foreign conflicts.

48,Movie-12,"Not just another Tony Scott action film--it's complex, thought-provoking. *** (out of four)",7,2 January 2002,"SPY GAME / (2001) *** (out of four)Tony Scott is known for his big budget, fast-paced, action-packed extravaganzas. His latest film, ""Spy Game"" is no exception. He takes advantage of a massive budget, but loses sight of human comprehension. It's difficult to grasp his moral when it's awash in a superficial style where individual shots seldom last more than thirty seconds, and where dialogue never exceeds the length of a short paragraph. There's not much time to introduce characters, situations, or even locations-datelines appear on the screen to identify times and places.Yet, it doesn't just feel as if we are in another movie by Tony Scott-everything feels very real. The danger is real. The characters are real. Many action films are about the action, special effects, and car chase sequences. ""Spy Game"" does contain those things, but they are in a focused, tight, evocative thriller. This movie is about the characters, not the action. It never forgets that. ""Spy Game"" contains a complex structure. We begin in 1991. Veteran CIA officer Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) prepares for retirement. On his last day, he learns that his one-time protégé, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), has been captured in a foreign prison on a charge of espionage and will be executed in 24 hours. Fearing international crisis, the CIA decides it would be too risky to save him. But with a new generation in control of the agency, Nathan is no longer an insider. He must outsmart his own agency in order to save his old friend.Most of the film plays out in flashbacks as the CIA digests valuable information from Muir. The movie spans from the Vietnam war to the end of the Cold War, with years ranging from 1965 to about 1991 (although the characters don't seem to age much). We learn Nathan chose Tom as a sharpshooter in Vietnam. He trained with Bishop. They formed a close bond, until something came between them-a woman.The forty-year span in time poses no problem for ""Spy Game."" The engaging screenplay, by Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata, focuses on only the necessary characters. The soundtrack, by Harry Gregson-Williams, masterfully captures the various time periods, spicing the scenes with a slick sense of style and intrigue. The cinematography by Daniel Mindel makes the differences in location clear. Christian Wagner's editing gives the movie a frenzied, almost rushed emotion, that puts us right in the middle of the race against time.Pitt and Redford retain their ground, despite a thick style. Redford creates a character out of nothing. We know little about him at the beginning, and we know little about him at the end. But he somehow gives his character a conscience, human values, and a lot of interest. We care about him because we do not like the black and white CIA operatives. Thus, we care about Pitt's character as well. Pitt gives his character an immature nature. He is in a stereotypical young hotshot role that might have fit him better a few years ago, but he still creates a grave sense of panic and fear.With a structure like this, we expect subplots to evolve from the flashbacks. There is an intriguing terrorist story. A love story. Themes about betrayal, trust, position, friendship, commitmentbut ""Spy Game"" never slows down and allows us to absorb these important details. By the end, we feel exhilarated, and we know we just watched a very smart, well-crafted film, but the most we can take from it is that it is a very smart, well-crafted film. I think, beneath all the style and surface, there is a little more to the movie than that.",Spy Game
49,FlickJunkie-2,Taut spy thriller,8,6 May 2002,"Despite a few inconsistencies and contrivances, Spy Games is one of the better espionage films to hit the streets in quite some time.  The story is intelligent, the action is brisk and the suspense taut.Tony Scott orchestrates the project well, perhaps overdoing the musical element a bit, but pacing well and creating an effective weave between flashbacks and current day events.  Yet, there are a couple of areas that bothered me.  First, Muir (Robert Redford) was consistently developed throughout the film to be a hardened leader, always looking at the big picture and following the imperative regardless of the human cost.  So, his rogue operation to save Bishop is completely out of character.  Not only is it difficult to believe that the CIA would have been fooled by some of his deceptions, it is hard to swallow the fact that he would have risked everything to pursue a rescue that was antithetical to his training, beliefs and personality.  It is also difficult to understand how Bishop was allowed to stay in the field, given his penchant for disobeying orders and his continual development of emotional attachments to his various human assets.  Such recklessness would never have been tolerated, because it would have endangered him, the assets, and would have potentially compromised whatever mission he was working on.  However, I suppose I need to cut the writers a little slack or otherwise there would have been no story.Robert Redford turns in an excellent performance, giving Muir a very hard edge and cunning mind.  Brad Pitt proves to be an effective action hero. This is the kind of role in which Pitt shines, playing the dark, rebellious character that lives by his own code and gives in to no one.  Catherine McCormack also delivers a credible performance as the humanitarian aid worker playing both sides of the street to get supplies for the disadvantaged. Action lovers will enjoy this film as will those who like a mentally challenging story.  I rated it 8/10.",Spy Game

Yes, I agree with most that the camera and the editing utilized are a little to 'modern' for my taste as well (they are too hectic), but that doesn't diminish the overall value of this motion picture.So why did I find this film to be good? Well, mainly because it is very realistic (except for the ending, but you can't have everything). It pictures world events and the operatives in them as they are, crude and ruthless. Decisions are made based only on interest, as is the case in real life. Robert Redford does an excellent job of portraying an experienced (read cynical) CIA operative who doesn't hesitate to use people and play with their lives whenever necessary (again, as is the case in real life, because spying is a brutal and unforgiving trade where only the strongest survive, it's not a charity where manuals need to be followed to the letter like most seem to think nowadays - no wonder the results of the western intelligence agencies are so pitiful recently).Judging from the reviews and user ratings though, for most of the movie-going public this realism was a big drawback, because people do not want to accept cruel truths nowadays, they do not want to accept the fact that in order to be free someone has to do the dirty work for them, they just want everything in life to be neat and spotless, in other words, politically correct.

No stranger to the machinations of the CIA's top echelon, Muir hones all his skills and irreverent manner in order to find a way to free Bishop.Considering the stellar cast and crew that made this film, this was a very disappointing, bland, forgettable experience. This isn't a BAD film. Most of the key ingredients are there to make it a good movie. They were just mixed together incorrectly. It is such a bland and boring movie that I just can't understand the rating is currently has. The story for this movie is so disappointing. I had infinitely more interest in the small stories told by Redford about him and Pitt. The modern day story for this film was so uninteresting and boring that even the film tries to sideline it for the majority of the film. Even the ending was very anticlimactic and uninteresting for me. And I knew exactly what I was supposedly getting into. I knew this was a drama/political thriller. I wasn't expecting The Avengers to pop up, or some huge action set piece. I just found the movie inexplicably boring and inefficient of what it was attempting to achieve.I do like things about this movie, however. Both Robert Redford and Brad Pitt were excellent in their respective roles. Their performances were easily the highlight of the movie, as was seeing two powerhouse actors working of off each other.On the subject of positives, the cinematography and editing were both decent and I do appreciate Scott's visual style.Despite these positives, Spy Game was just boring for me.

63,Shiva-11,Welcome to the wonderful world of dirty dealing and disinformation.,7,21 November 2001,"Spies have played an integral role in world affairs since the dawn of military strategy their inception - Sun Tzu extolled their virtues and necessity in his epic tome over 2400 years ago.   Their numbers increased rapidly during the Cold War, and unlike superspy James Bond, they were not suave and debonair ladies men.  They did what they felt had to be done, whether it meant starting proxy wars, assassinating leaders  brokering weapons deals or acting as middlemen for drug smugglers - their only concern was what they deemed to be the ""right"" outcome.  In this shadowy netherworld ethics and morals were not a requirement, indeed they could prove to be more of a hindrance.Nathan Muir is a company man.  A normally admirable quality, it takes on a dark tinge when you do intelligence work for the CIA, and it is your job to ensure that the bad guys (whoever they happen to be this week), don't win. When his former protégé - Tom Bishop, a Boy Scout trained marksman - is arrested on a mission, Nathan has 24 hours to stop his execution. Complicating the situation is the Agency's desire to distance themselves from the whole situation and for the first time in his career, Nathan's any-ends-justifies-the-means creed is put to the test.This is the first teaming of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt since ""A River Runs Through It"" although this time they are working side by side as actors, rather than director and actor.  Both men equally capable of carrying a film on their own, and thankfully neither overwhelms the other.  Given his past performance as a ""good guy"" it is a pleasure to watch Redford as the pragmatist in a dirty business who is at best riding the fence between good and evil.  Pitt's early moments on film are just as strong, however as the film commences, he's not given the leeway to flesh out his character, eventually becoming the naive idealist.  The supporting cast, with the exception of Nathan's slithery chief foil (whose name unfortunately escapes me) is competent yet generally unremarkable.  The same cannot be said of the filming.There is some noteworthy cinematography, notably the slow motion sequence of a building being blown up, the war correspondent style coverage of the guerilla gunfights and the searing sepia tinted sequences in Vietnam.  These highlights are submerged amongst choppy gimmicky stylistic shots, the most egregious being the stop motion 360-degree pan introduced in ""The Matrix"" (I stopped counting after the ninth one).  I also found it difficult to believe that Redford or Pitt could easily blend in with any group they happened to be among - they just look a little too good.As spy films go, Spy Game may not be the best, but it is intriguing , watchable and  has enough clever little twists to keep your attention.",Spy Game

But it could have been better.",Spy Game
65,fung0,Not as smart as it wants to be,5,29 April 2014,"Spy Game is almost a good movie. Unfortunately, it fails to pay off on any of its worthwhile ambitions.At first, it seems like some sort of inside look at the 'spy game.' Brad Pitt's character is going to learn something about life and morality, as in a LeCarre thriller. Pitt does eventually make a big realization, but it's abrupt, with very little psychological lead-up. And the subsequent evolution of the story is barely sketched in. Early on, Pitt looks like one type of character. Later, we're told he's another type. The only thing missing is the good stuff in between.Meanwhile, as we see what Redford's character is up to, we're tempted to think this may be some sort of cat-and-mouse intellectual exercise, reminiscent of the brilliant Hopscotch. But Redford's 'cleverness' just isn't all that clever, or even interesting. He reads the back of a memo. He uses the phone in a neighbouring office. He steals a key card. Big deal. Not only are they banal, most of these events (such as his final exit from the film) are completely implausible. Unless you put your brain on 'Park,' you're constantly asking yourself ""But wouldn't they see that?"" ""Couldn't the world's biggest spy organization just send some people to stop him?"" ""Aren't there procedures that anticipate this sort of simple trick?""And again, as with Pitt, we are left totally in the dark as far as Redford's ultimate change of character. Why does he act against all the weighty advice he gives Pitt early on in his training? We see that he's undergone some sort of transformation, but never given any insight into it. One minute, Redford is an unchanging brick of a character, a bastion of the amoral CIA philosophy. The next, he's a malicious prankster with an over-riding personal morality. This key transformation happens off-screen (like Pitt's), with no explanation. That's not clever, it's just annoying. If I wanted to write my own movie, I wouldn't be watching this one.Along the way, there are endless plot holes. The biggest of all being the basic framework of the story. Why is a committee of CIA top brass sitting around for two days, listening to Redford's reminiscences? Someone says it's to 'get something' on Pitt's character. That's not remotely plausible. We actually see a manufactured press item on the news, at one point, showing how easily the whole problem can be addressed, without listening to hours of Redford's banter, and without giving Redford hours to take action, as he's left to wander unsupervised through CIA headquarters.Spy Game isn't unpleasant to watch. It's nicely produced, with some genuinely interesting episodes. Unfortunately, those episodes fail to connect into a coherent whole. The Redford and Pitt characters are intriguing, but we never learn what makes them tick. They're ciphers at the end just as they were at the beginning.Watching Spy Game is like reading the outline of a movie. A good movie, to be sure. Maybe someone will make it someday.",Spy Game
66,Aidan McGuinness,Good... but that's it.,6,7 February 2002,"""Spy Game"" is good. It's not bad. It's not great. It's just... good. If ever there was a slightly-better-than-average-forgettable-enjoyable flick then this is it. It's already in the 6.5/10 range...Acting is fine. Redford is his usual self and Pitt admirably does the wild-headed young man. Again. The plot is grand enough - interestingly it's basically Redford sitting around recounting past tales of Pitt's character - Bishop's - life. These stories are intended to fill us in on how Bishop came to be where he currently is - about to be executed in a Chinese prison. Redford's character - Muir - is trying to stop him and so needs to chat to get the resources and information to do so. It's a nice enough structure and works fine - and we do fill in gaps that make us go ""oh so that's what he meant earlier"" etc. Sure it's not original but effective. The direction is generally fine except when Tony Scott goes insane and starts speeding the camera around like the Road Runner on amphetamines. It's a tad over the top lad - calm down..Other than that the movie goes along fairly briskly and we're kept reasonably entertained throughout. After seeing it I could shrug my shoulders and forget it all having pleasantly enough passed away the time. 6.5/10",Spy Game
67,lyubitelfilmov,The teacher saves the student or How to beat the CIA,7,16 January 2021,"Spy thriller. I continue to plunge into the world of intelligence and espionage, and today this dramatic thriller directed by Tony Scott with the participation of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, which has been looming for a long time, but only now has reached his hands (thanks to the game Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War) ... I heard good reviews about this picture - and they really turned out to be true, and here's my short opinion - the Teacher saves the student. Despite the unconditional and expressive advantages, the picture, nevertheless, there were also disadvantages, which I will talk about. Now, let your humble servant finish with the preface and proceed to the picture itself.
So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - Nathan Muir, an experienced CIA agent, is only one day away from retirement, so he should have gone great with fun chatting with colleagues and drinking, but it was not. The fact is that in China, Tom Bishop, Nathan's protege, with whom he has long-standing friendly and working relations, was detained and will soon be executed for espionage. The high authorities want to leave Tom, and then Nathan begins to develop a rescue plan while there is still time. Believe me, the script is well written here and will tickle your nerves more than once. It is impossible to tear yourself away from what is happening on the screen, if you do not try. The tension, the intrigue, the twists and turns are in place and very well furnished and played. Well, the finale will surprise you no less than me, I am sure of this, although its general features can be guessed almost already in the second half. The script is original, not a film adaptation, although I'm sure the CIA helped a little, you know, everyone here is adults. Nevertheless, I can only praise the creators.
2. Atmosphere - from the first shot to the very final credits, you will be surrounded by an atmosphere of espionage and tension literally in the air, which will not let go for a minute. The world of espionage is when danger surrounds everywhere, where you cannot even trust your own people, where information is more expensive than human life, and other delights. The creators clearly tried over it. Well, it was completed by the excellent music of composer Harry Gregson-Williams. Which, unfortunately, does not look at all apart from the picture.
3. The subtleties of espionage - the picture draws attention to this, and it is foolish to argue with the fact that it was successful. Although they will never tell us the whole truth, otherwise everyone will want intelligence and spies, and then the budget of many states will collapse. This work is hard, often thankless, but very, very necessary both then, now and in the future. You can be sure.
4. Places of action - the picture will show us several regions and countries during the Cold War, some armed conflicts, their consequences for local residents, some subtleties of international relations. There are no revelations, superficially, and everything is within the context, but interesting. You look, somebody will be interested in it.
5. Dynamics - there is practically no fighting in the picture, but due to the constant dynamics, conversations, atmosphere and characters, the picture looks almost in one breath, and does not let you get bored or even relax for a minute. For a spy drama thriller, this is a great achievement, given that in this genre of cinema is represented, as a rule, by monotonous detectives looking for a ""mole"".
So the disadvantages:
1. Nathan's action - I will not specify what exactly, because I do not want to spoil the view for those who did not see. I just do not believe that everything went so ""smoothly and successfully"". Forgive me - I don't believe it! Maybe this was done for the sake of entertainment and unexpectedness, but if you think about it, it sounds fantastic, even with the technologies of that time.
2. Luck - Nathan is often lucky in some moments that in reality he would not have succeeded, because the CIA is the CIA, not only idiots work there. There are not many such moments, but they raise questions that no one will answer.
A little about the main characters:
1. Nathan Muir played by Robert Redford is an experienced CIA agent who must get his student out of a Chinese prison before he is executed for espionage. Charismatic, impolite, tough, for whom people are a consumable on the way to the goal. Become a mentor to Tom Bishop. It should be said that Robert has already played such heroes, and here he is a real master. He was charged with Adler, one of the CIA operatives in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Praise Robert, praise!
2. Tom Bishop performed by Brad Pitt - a CIA agent, Nathan's protégé, thundered into a Chinese prison due to an accident. A shooting sparrow who successfully completed a series of covert operations. He does not consider people to be consumables, unlike his mentor, which often became the cause of conflicts. Brad is convincing as always, and even with a battered face looks handsome. Well done!
3. Charles Harker played by Stephen Dillane is one of the ""high"" CIA bigwigs who is trying to ""hush up"" the Bishop case and get as much information from Nathan as possible. Tries to keep an eye on experienced Nathan. Stannis Baratheon himself plays here when he was a little younger, and the role was great for him. A careerist and a so-called ""stationery rat"" sitting in the office and not fond of dirty work.
Not a masterpiece, but a good spy movie about the people of this profession.
As a result, we have a good spy drama thriller, with a good and tense script, great music and atmosphere, dynamics that will not let you get bored and great acting.

69,honorhorror,Replace Catherine McCormack and the movie would have win an Oscar.,7,16 June 2009,"I am currently considering giving it a 7.5 or even higher, because it's apparently above the average. As a political/espionage thriller, it stands firmly on the core of story--friendship beyond politics and era.The highlight of the movie is not the action, although the actions are tight and well edited. Over the two hours of viewing, audiences will find Mr. Redford most fascinating. He is the real star here. In my opinion he deserved to be nominated by the main stream awards. He gave a performance very memorable, multi-dimensional and with good character development. Brad Pitt did his part OK, although from time to time he doesn't really look like a soldier more alike a cowboy. What really drags the film is the female lead, Catherine McCormack. She doesn't feel comfortable in the whole picture at all, and the romance between her and Pitt was totally a farce since she looks a decade older than Pitt, not to mention her ""manly"" tough look. Every time when she's on the screen a lame tenor song plays to coordinate her existence, that's really at odds with the entire film. Could they be deleted, I'd give Spy Game an 8.As a Chinese I also like to mention the portrait of China in the movie is not accurate. First off, the prisons would never be touched by foreigners, be it International Aid Org or Red Cross or anything. Secondly, Su Chou was not a coast city at all, and Chinese army would never allow their soldiers to have pet birds on duty...... For the negative portrait of the bureaus I can take that.

As a 7, I don't hate it, but there is always room for criticism on a 7 of 10.I basically enjoyed the 2 hours. I only criticized it in the first 20 minutes as a few ridiculous assumptions were made. And, they weren't even necessary. Also, the other major criticism was the editing. Horrible! Obviously, this movie was much longer late in the process and someone went at it with a meat cleaver at the last minute.Lastly, I just didn't think it had the suspense I expected it would have. Although the idea of a spy game within the inner sanctum of the CIA was unique and intriguing, I just thought it fell flat compared to spy games in the field. And, Redford was too subdued in the role.But, I sat through it and I gave it a 7.

Since this a mainstream movie, expect a typical mainstream ending. I predicted the ending of this movie at the halfway point. If this movie did not have so many flashbacks, maybe I would'nt of looked at my watch often during the movie. This movie is more of a heavy drama, rather than a thriller. The only action in the movie is in the beginning and end.Other than that, it's mostly men talking around a table interviewing Redford.

All the performances are great, and every character is unique. You almost feel sorry for some characters, while others are there simply for comic relief. No matter which they may be, everyone involved succeeds at their purpose. I really like Redford's character...it wasn't really anything new for him, but he was still funny and just plain cool.

I mean, they ought to do it, in more movies - by all means, but that doesn't mean that they should screw up the time-frame of which the movie and the plot spans.To be tighter in this film only made it poorer. Even with no breaks for rest or eat  the time frame of spy game is far fetched.It simply is impossible to reach over all the events that are suggested, in such short time span as we are tried to be made believe by the storytellers.",Spy Game
75,Jexxon,Lame Game,2,4 February 2005,"Spy Game may be labeled as a thriller, but it's really a drama/love story. Brad Pitt plays a spy who ends up in a Chinese prison facing execution in 24 hours, so it's up to his mentor, it's-my-last-day-at-work Redford to try and get him out. This is done sitting in an office reminiscing on past events for the entire length of the film.The focus of the film is not on spy training or even spy business,rather it's a film about Pitt's doubt as to whether or not what he's doing is right. How much fun is that to watch? Well, it isn't. It's pretty damn boring. I'm not a huge fan of flashbacks, and considering that this film is essentially one long flashback, it's really hard to like.Tony Scott tries to hide the fact that almost nothing happens over two very long hours with an array of helicopter shots, fast editing, and bombastic music. It may look exciting, but it isn't.Then there's the many illogical (or more like really stupid) plot holes that raises a lot of questions: The film takes place over several years, yet nobody seems to grow any older/younger. If you're a spy, is it such a good idea to be talking about your job in public, all the time? How come that everyone at the CIA are morons? Does Robert ""My face is looking suspiciously tight"" Redford's spy training only include sneaking a peek at top secret papers (he does it at least three times)? Why did the script have to be of the kind where problems are solved by constantly using suspension of disbelief, (""Hmm, I could really use a satellite photo of a shoreline looking exactly like the one I want to steal... But wait, I just happen to have one lying here in my desk, next to the money I just happen to need to bribe some Chinese guys to cut the electricity on a couple of islands, so that our choppers can fly in and raid a prison."").The ending also feels weird. The entire film establishes Redford as a smirking heartless assassin, who in the end is celebrated (with a choir singing on the soundtrack) for getting his not quite so ruthless protégé out of prison. Of course, he also made sure that Brad's terrorist girlfriend got out after a couple of years in prison, which was the right thing to do, considering that he put her there in the first place.On the whole, Spy Game may look like a critique of the dirty work the CIA does, but scrape on the surface, and you'll find that they really justify and glorify their actions. In other words, it's the same kind of propaganda as always. On the plus side though, it's not quite as awful as The Recruit. [2/10]",Spy Game
76,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,Nice spy film with foreboding constellations concering Chinese-US relations.,10,17 September 2021,"Interesting about this spy film is, that it's not the CIA guys who are manipulating the NGO sector, but rather the other way around - with CIA agent Tom Bishop being worked and seduced by the UK anti-Chinese human rights activist Elizabeth Hadley. With Bishop succumbing to her charms and altruistic principles, she drives a wedge between CIA operative Nathan Muir and his protege Tom Bishop - the two men having conflicting views about the woman, and ending their friendship because of her. And this all escalates into a very big drama between people - as well as nations - since human rights activist Elizabeth Hadley has a big problem with China.Being an NGO human rights activist myself, I actually could not relate that well to the film, since I have had not any problems at all with China; as they are plenty of competent leaders there, who aspire peace and harmony with the International Community. One example of a diligent leader in China is President Xi Jinping, who I'm proud to say is a very good friend of mine, since he is doing his utmost to manifest peace and prosperity between China and the International Community.However, I must say that all lead actors gave a very convincing performance, with Tom Bishop and Elizabeth Hadley making a very fine and formidable couple - an alliance between the CIA and NGO community so to speak. So perhaps a whiff of propaganda there, in the sense that the Intelligence Community wants to signal that they are sentimentally receptive to the human rights challenges in China.But here again, as a human rights activist, I could not relate very well to this dramatization - as well as romanticization! - between the CIA and human rights activists; since I have never worked and seduced a CIA agent myself :)",Spy Game
77,xbrad68,The CIA and the Chinese meet,10,12 June 2005,"The movie Spy Game makes the CIA look good. To paraphrase President Kennedy the successes of the CIA are not told their failures are known. Both Robert Redford and Brad Pitt are exceptional actors. It is a real treat to see them in a movie together. Redford plays a high ranking CIA officer named Nathan Muir who flashes back to working with Pitts character Tom Bishop. Garrick Hagon plays CIA director Cy Wilson with style. Will Muir be able to get Wilson to free Bishop from China? Watch this cliffhanger film and find out. Operation Dinner Out is silly name for an op. Something like Operation Twin Galaxies sounds more grandiose. My stepmother is Chinese and I have come to appreciate subtle Chinese humor. If an Alien Species ever demanded humans to fight then America and China could fight a war on terrorism helping each other. In a letter to the Chinese Leadership first President Bush spoke of the close ties America has with China going back to President Nixon, Secretary of State Kissinger and Triangular Diplomacy. The great military Stategist Sun Tzu once said Feign confusion and destroy the enemy. It may look like there are too many American Intelligence Agencies but there is really only the American Secret Service. I think that there is something special about each American President and a sequel to Spygame should have someone playing the American President.",Spy Game

79,mattrochman,Cracking spy thriller with an engaging plot,9,18 March 2007,"This was a memorable spy film with a good above-average-intelligence plot and plenty of style. Even though it was hollywooded up, the film had a good sense of realism. There were no missiles firing out of cars and metal-cutting lasers that shoot out the side of a watch.In this film, the espionage and spy-related activities were more subtle and accordingly, much more realistic and intriguing.Aside from the good fundamentals, the film had two stand out features that gave it the ""complete package"" feel. The first was Robert Redford. I am one of those film-goers who bemoans the loss of magnificent acting talents and embraces good looking dead heads to mindlessly work their way through the script. Redford has a magnificent speaking voice, a dramatic on-screen presence and controlled yet powerful tone that is almost non-existent in the current up-and-coming crop of popular actors. But Redford is from the old school, where true acting talent was the first criterion upon which you'd be hired to do a film. Probably the only stand out actor/actress of the modern era, with plenty of presence and power, is Hillary Swank.The second thing that made this film special was the fact that the film seamlessly jumped between the past and present. I love films where the characters are revisiting events of the past rather than a simply linear story. It allows the film-makers to highlight the essentials and leave out the boring connecting story line.Cracker and highly recommended viewing.",Spy Game

Also, there is no attempt to change either actors' features from the flash-back to 1975 to the present-time in the movie (1991). Neither of them are supposed to have aged at all in 16 years!! I think this movie would have been better, too, if it had spent more time in the 1991 scenario rather than disappearing down so many dark corners comprised of flash-back scenes.3/10",Spy Game
81,simonrosenbaum,never mind the flashback can I have my cashback!,5,25 January 2004,There was a good film here struggling to get out but unfortunately it wasn't allowed to. When you spend most of the film trying to work out how old Redford is suppose to be and how old he really is and thinking when he's suppose to be 16 years younger that he does actually look a lot younger you know somethings wrong! Tony Scott has made some damn fine action movies but here he's badly misjudged things with excessively bombastic direction and tiresome uninvolving flashbacks that take up most of the film's two hours. There's one point about an hour in when things start to get interesting as Redford tries to fool the CIA but this lasts just a few minutes and then we're back to flashbacks. The only thing that keeps you watching is Redford who's still as charismatic as ever. (5/10),Spy Game
82,pri_e,Quite good...,7,20 February 2002,"The first I heard of this movie was when Brad Pitt and Robert Redford had been doing a gig on I think ""The Jay Leno Show"" where they played all these jokes to get people to see the movie. It looked pretty good from the trailer as well, and I must say I was pretty happy with the result. I'm not a huge fan of Robert Redford but he did a good job as Muir, really cunning and genuine. The movie also confirmed to me that Brad Pitt is more than just a pretty face, his character Tom was intelligent and fast. I thought they could have expanded his role a bit more, maybe give more information on his background. Also they don't really say why his friend Tran was able to walk away from the ambulance scott free leaving behind a fellow comrade. Also Catherine McCormack's character could have been given a bit more screen time not too mention a proper explanation of her past...they sort of skim it.Either way I give this a 7/10",Spy Game

What we do need is a little more suspense and intrigue. Give the viewer a little credit. When you have a story that is SMARTER than the average viewer only THEN do you have to start worrying about losing people. The flashbacks were too long and served little purpose.

This movie talks way too much and moves really really slow, i couldn't wait until the movie was over. I saw people leaving the theater which i also kind of wanted to do at one point but i gave this movie a shot but man the ending is not worth it at all. I was more interested on what was happening to Brad Pitt in the prison instead of his past life and all this talking in the Meeting room.okay so the action scenes were realistic, if they didnt have them then we would all think this movie stink but they did do a good job of making this movie seem real but the story was boring.last note, the part where the asians were watching Baywatch was lame. Nobody even laughed at that scene either because they also thought it was lame but the movie made us soo tired we couldn't even laugh.5/10",Spy Game
85,nzpedals,"Great acting, patchy story",8,18 March 2015,"Part of the story is set in the present as senior CIA people respond to the capture and impending execution of an agent, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), who has been caught trying to rescue someone from a Chinese prison, but who, and why? They want to get the personal files of Bishop from Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) who has been Bishop's controller. There is a flashback as Muir tells of meeting Bishop in Vietnam, where Bishop is a sniper, and another when Bishop is recruited when in Berlin.We see the mentor/student relationship develop, we see aspects of both their personalities and also that of the whole CIA culture.When Muir learns that Bishop is at Su Chou prison, he realises who Bishop was trying to rescue and why. There is another flashback to tell about Bishop's meeting with Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack), and what follows.Hadley is an aid worker at a refugee camp in Beirut where Muir and Bishop have come to assassinate a terrorist commander. Bishop very quickly moves into Hadley's apartment. There is no explicit bed-wrestling, just a couple of early-morning scenes. This low-key approach by the writers makes a much stronger impression. We can see they are deeply committed.But Muir knows about Hadley's background and regards her as a threat both to Bishop and all the CIA's operations, so he organises her abduction and rendition to China.Six years go by. When Bishop is in Hong Kong, he hears about a white woman in a nearby prison and realises it must be his love, hence the rescue attempt, which very nearly succeeds.When Muir hears that the ""company"" will not even try to negotiate for the release of Bishop, he forges the Director's signature to authorise a ""Plan B"" that Bishop had prepared, and he uses his life's savings to bribe a power company manager to turn off the lights for thirty minutes. Plan ""B"" proceeds and succeeds, and Muir can retire happily.Redford and Pitt and McCormack play their parts superbly. They really become the characters. There are some great scenes, with great dialogue. The writers have done a great job, with some neat philosophical gems by Muir. Other actors are also great, Stephen Dillane, Marianne Jean-Baptiste especially.Only rated an 8, mainly because the movie really needs to be seen two or three times to pick up the connections between some incidents.",Spy Game
86,VinceGambini,"Worst Tony Scott Movie, By Far.",2,14 April 2020,I missed Spygame when it came out in 2001. Watched it in 2020 and realized I hadn't missed out on anything. It's hard to believe this is a Tony Scott movie. The director of masterpieces such as Deja Vu. This one here is disappointing in every possible way. Robert Redford: probably his worst movie ever. Brad Pitt: the usual disaster. The plot: pure nonsense. The flashbacks: pointless. The soundtrack: not sure how to describe it. It's just low quality. There is really nothing worth the 2 hours it takes to get through this.

88,cmoyton,"The Spy who Loved Me,,,,,,,,,,,",1,26 December 2012,"I have watched Spy Game twice now with a gap of six years between viewings. I felt that maybe i was a bit harsh first time around when the continuity errors really bugged me (as in erroneous dates, cellphones when they didn't exist etc). Having watched it again and even ignoring this carelessness, my core opinion has not changed - this is a turkey.Sorry but i missed to alleged tension and excitement that others somehow managed to glean from this. The Bishop character changes from a no questions asked baby faced assassin in Nam to becoming an idealist . Hardly the trait of an espionage operative. His initial training seems to consist of chatting up women on the street and blagging his way into an old codgers flat. When he is in the Berlin bar during the cold war he blurts out the fact that he and Muir are both spies. ooooooops,hope the KGB weren't listening.Once in the field our pretty boy ( come on he is just toooo pretty to convince as a spy) sees fit to drag Muir across an urban battlefield in Lebanon to get to a restaurant to snoop on a terrorist leader. Surely there was a safer route. Then when the suicide car bomb explodes he wanders moronically towards the burning building and the Islamic militia. A militia man then just shoos him away - very realistic - not.Apaert form the dreadful love story between Pitt and the ""human rights activist"" there is a lot of on screen Puppy Love between Pitt and Redford. In fact Redford gives Pitt a lesson in acting and Pitt seems gormless in his scenes with Redford . May have seemed like a good idea at the time but Pitt is totally miscast here and gives one of his worst performances running The Devils Own close.The very essence of this travesty is a love story and the message that friendship is paramount, not orders. Sorry did't i hear the word assets mentioned a dozen times.Watch instead the based on a true story movie ""Farewell"" to observe how dirty the spy game really is to see the fate suffered by an idealist spy and his idealist handler.

When Nathan arrives at work he realizes the situation is serious as he sent to questioning about Tom, who is to be executed in 24 hours. Plenty of flashbacks on how the two met, how Nathan got Tom involved as an undercover agent and in all the time Nathan is telling the story of Tom to his superiors he tries to find a way in order to rescue Tom during the questioning without the usage of friends, assets and access keys.This was one of Robert Redford's best movies, it reminds me of his performance in Sneakers only better and this man is truly like fine wine!I've never been a fan of Brad Pitt although I believe his only movie that was decent enough to watch was Legends of the Fall and this one stands right beside it! 10/10!",Spy Game

91,RolloTomasi,falls just short,7,1 December 2001,"SPOILERSThere's some elements here that don't sit right with me. Misuses military resources out of guilt. He risks Marines' lives just because he made a mistake? This has the same sort of theme as ""Clear and Present Danger."" I hate to admit it, but the Clancy film illustrated the government betrayal much better than this did. ""Danger"" paints an even grimmer (comical, even) picture of the behind-the-scenes goings-on of the CIA, but Ryan's actions are easier to get behind. He's horrified when he finds out he's been organizing a secret military operation the whole time and moves to make things right immediately. Muir didn't give a damn about Elizabeth Hadley, who he put in a Chinese prison knowingly, until his own man was put on death row. A better ending would have been the CIA stopping Muir at the gate and arresting him. Just seems like he should have had to serve some kind of punishment. The whole film condemns the methods the CIA uses to achieve its ends, which Muir is the master of. Few in the Agency ever have to answer for anything, so his escape is symbolic, even typical--which is why he should be made to answer for his last operation and those that came before. But then we're back to justifying the budget: no downer endings allowed. Whether the visible, hardly secret, involvement of the CIA in Operation Enduring Freedom had any effect on ""Spy Game"" is a mystery. Scott's direction: a bit too much flash. Sometimes a scene doesn't need a moving camera. Trust the actors, trust the audience. For instance, the scene shot atop the Fujifilm building--overdone. On the other hand, there is some fine cross-cutting action in several scenes; in particular I remember the Vietnam flashback scene where Bishop is first used as a sniper by Muir. Likewise the film's centerpiece, Bishop's race to get the doctor to the physical where he'll poison the terrorist leader, is flawless. These are all shot selection and editing; simple, elegant filmmaking. 
""Spy Game"" does successfully illustrate its point, which is to ask, Can a human being ever be just a means to an end? How important is the 'greater good' in the face of sacrificing a person? I wish I could give ""Spy Game"" a higher recommendation.

92,hofnarr,It's hard to get out of the CIA,7,21 November 2001,"It's been just over 1/4 of a century since Robert Redford played a CIA agent in THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR (cut down from the James Grady novel, SIX DAYS OF THE CONDOR). And just as some have noted similarities between Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in 1974's THE CONVERSATION and his Edward Lyle in ENEMY OF THE STATE (the last film Tony Scott directed before SPY GAME) I think that Redford's Joe Turner, a literature researcher for the CIA in THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, after surviving all the trials and tribulations there, could easily have transmogrified into Nathan Muir of SPY GAMES - why not? Where else would a new identity be easier to create?;)Here's a quote from Redford's Joe Turner in the '74 film: ""You know, you guys are amazing. You think not getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the truth!""I didn't have a micro-cassette going to record at last night's sneak preview, so I don't have any ""compare/contrast"" quotes, (Although Muir does say to one of his colleagues something to the effect ""Do you remember when we could tell who the bad guys were?"") but I think the character of Redford's 2 CIA agents are not dissimilar.The story is staged within a 24 hour period of time, which keeps the tension up. The story begins in the present and keeps flashing back to the past & then to the present again in cycles not unlike that in Orson Welle's CITIZEN KANE - but in SPY GAME you get an onscreen clock and a location on the screen so you don't get too disoriented.I don't want to get into a plot analysis (I'm sure you can find that elsewhere); I just have a few comments to make, some of which could be construed to be mild spoilers, so read on at your own risk.There are a number of times Nathan Muir gives advice to his protege, Tom Bishop and by the end of the film he has violated every single one of his espoused principles. This *is* a little humorous (kind of black, but still funny) but it also tends to telegraph later actions. There was also a scene in the trailer (seemingly spliced out of the print that we had) which has Muir saying something about if you mix business with pleasure, make sure the business comes first. That time clock popping up on the screen was handy, but it wasn't always there. In at least one point, assuming an evenness of time flow, it seemed highly unlikely that a copy of a fax Muir sent (I believe internationally) somehow appears wrinkled/crumpled in a CIA briefing room with Muir et al moments later. Perhaps I missed something somewhere - quite likely. Hey - it's a spy film. Extraordinary things can happen. But they should happen within a believable framework. Maybe it's like people pointing out continuity errors in HARRY POTTER - hey - that film's ABOUT magic - who's to say the characters didn't do the ""errors""? (""What fools these muggles be!"") But I digress;)It was a fun film - no CITIZEN KANE but then few films are. I thought Redford and Pitt worked well together (I believe Redford cast Pitt for A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) and the chemistry was there at that time also). This screening was shown under the auspices of the Film Society at Case Western Reserve University in Strosacker Auditorium - all 500+ seats were filled and a number of people had to be turned away. The audience seemed well-engaged and there was a fair amount of applause at the end. You might want to go to a matinee or wait for a second-run theatre but this film won't be the same on video or dvd - see it on the big screen.",Spy Game

Well they found one more and both Pitt and Redford can be proud of their work here. What started out as a film choice to avoid the lineups for Lord of the Rings ended up as one of the best films I've seen this year.

Redford uses rest breaks and guile to find out what's happened, and arrange a rescue..It's a solid film, mostly in flashback, about Brad's recruitment and their subsequent spying exploits in the Cold War and Beirut.  If I had to criticise (and I do), it would be that Brad Pitt was supposedly recruited as a sniper in the Vietnam War!  He's 38 years old, looks nearer 30 even in real life, and we're expected to believe he's a minimum of 55 years old.  I may have some dates wrong (I was only half-watching the film), but that killed the drama stone dead for me.I would also say that although I enjoyed Redford's race-against-time, the 'memories' - which make up about 2/3 of the film, left me curiously bored. They're well shot and everything; no faulting the visuals; but I was bored (and I'll sit through almost anything).

96,revere-7,"SPY GAME is like a chess game, intriguing way to pass the time, but not a fond memory.",6,14 August 2002,"INCLUDES POSSIBLE SPOILERS:On his last day with the CIA, an agent played by Robert Redford, becomes embroiled in an international incident involving a spy named Bishop (for some reason, always an unlucky name in movies) who he trained years ago.Over the years, I do think Redford has shown himself to be a very poor (albeit lucky) spy. You'd think he'd lie in wait for the baddies, or at least learn to keep his important files in a safe deposit box or booby trap his office. I mean in ""3 Days of the Condor"" they ransack his office, steal files, and kill his associates... In ""Sneakers"" they do it again... at least in ""Spy Game"" they don't kill anyone when they ransack his office.
Of course there is a lot of Fantasy in this take on the CIA... (we all know the CIA doesn't have all it's internal phones bugged, or know unimportant details about it's long time agents - like whether or not they're married and to whom! NAH, they wouldn't know about that stuff). As usual, anyone carrying an AK can't hit the broadside of a barn (or two guys in the open on top of a hill from a helicopter - or a car in the middle of a street from an overlooking building, etc.).On the whole, the film is a pretty good thriller of the story-told-in-flashback style. The story is both a genre picture, and a commentary on the business of spying not dissimilar to the disenfranchised cold war Hitchcockian movies of the French New Wave, though Spy Game never really elevates much beyond the level of solid genre film.While both Redford and Pitt turn in fine performances, the thrills never reach the heights of others of it's type (check out the 80s remake of ""The Big Clock"" called ""No Way Out"" for a more thrilling take on Washington intrigue). All in all, ""Spy Game"" is enjoyable but nothing more.",Spy Game
97,paul-nemecek,A great journey,8,8 July 2018,"Director Tony Scott is no newcomer in directing military thrillers and stories of political intrigue. His past films include Top Gun, Crimson Tide, and Enemy of the State. This is not new ground for actor Robert Redford either. Redford plays Nathan Muir, a CIA operative on his last day on the job. At different points, Redford's character reminded me of his previous characters in All The President's Men, Three Days of the Condor, and Sneakers.In Spy Game, both actor and director live up to the standards set by these previous works, and on occasion even manage to transcend. Redford's Nathan Muir is recruiter and mentor for protégé Tom Bishop (capably portrayed by Brad Pitt). Like this year's Training Day the center of the film is the tension between the cynical, somewhat jaded veteran and the starry-eyed idealist rookie. Like this year's Tailor of Panama or Oliver Stone's Salvador there is a love interest that complicates the relationship between the two men. In an odd twist of casting fate, Catherine McCormack (Braveheart, Dangerous Beauty) plays the love interest in this film and in Tailor of Panama.The central debate that drives the film is the ethics of espionage. What means are justified by particular desired ends? The question is certainly a relevant and important question in the current political context. The plot, in brief, is protégé becomes a rogue spy in order to save his love interest, and veteran becomes a rogue in order to save his protégé.Any good thriller has to have sufficient twists and turns to keep us guessing, and Spy Games does not disappoint. The story is well written and director Scott does a good job of making the story come to life. The performances by Pitt and McCormack are solid performances, but Redford's Nathan Muir is the central character and Redford makes the most of the part. In fact, I have difficulty imagining another acting playing the part after watching Redford at work. The Redford persona that started with the Sundance Kid comes through in the world-weary, somewhat cynical Nathan Muir.I was tempted to review Harry Potter this week (I liked it). For engaging fantasy and escape, Harry Potter is hard to beat. I suspect, however, that Harry Potter fans have already seen the film and Harry Potter detractors will see it when Hogwarts Academy freezes over. If you are ready for a film that will keep you engaged and stimulate conversations about realpolitik in the modern era, or if you want to see Redford at the top of his game, Spy Game is worth a look.",Spy Game
98,RJBose,"Everybody Loses in This Game- A Vanity Piece, Ridiculous and Inane",2,17 August 2002,"The most interesting and remarkable part of ""Spy Game"" is the opportunity to observe how much Brad Pitt resembles Robert Redford in his (much) younger days.  The rest is a fatuous and banal waste of time (I saw it on a transcontinental flight and had no choice but to suffer through it).The movie seems to have been thrown together simply as a vanity piece for Mr. Redford, who walks through the very familiar role of the ""renegade"" CIA man, reluctantly forced into doing good and outsmarting the bad guys (at the CIA of course).  Banal devices such as locations and times printed across the bottom of the screen to accompanying urgent typewriter sound effects cannot save this ""B Movie"" from the drastic holes in its plot, and outrageously far-fetched scenarios.  Mr. Redford's character looks remarkably the same in scenes supposed to be thirty years apart (Vietnam in the late '60s and ultimately during his final days before retirement from the CIA in the '90s).  Brad Pitt's character does not appear to age at all from a young sergeant in Vietnam (about 20 years old) to a CIA ""contact employee"" who would thus be at least in his mid-forties during the film's setting in the 1990's. The film's producers and directors seem to be of the opinion that movie fans there to see poster-boys Redford and Pitt will overlook the preposterously flimsy storyline, and lack of any coherent plot.  Pitt's character's training as a cold war CIA operative appears to consist of nothing more challenging than a series of fraternity initiation pranks (""I want to see you get in that building and standing on that balcony in fifteen minutes""). Redford's tweed-jacketed CIA Far East analyst strolls through the CIA headquarters making secret calls on his cell phone on his last day at work and cleverly arranges for an armed attack inside of a foreign country with a hand forged paper(apparently without any consequences or international reprecussions) to serve his own purposes. (Remember how agitated the Chinese got when one of their jets crashed into that US surveillance plane?  What do you think they'd do if armed helicopters and soldiers attacked an installation well within Chinese territory?) The ostensible romance between Pitt's character and an English social worker is pivitol to the plot, but is barely addressed.  Poorly conceived, and badly written, ""Spy Game"" is as idiotic as it is inept.",Spy Game
99,ayric,Out of Focus,5,21 December 2001,"I was relieved to see that this was not another patriotic ode to America as both the title and the plot may indicate. Sure, we are supposed to care about the story simply because there is an American (Pitt) sitting in an Asian prison, but instead of seeing the whole army going out of its way to get him out, the story is about Redford's character trying to con the CIA who is reluctant to save him. I'm glad the filmmakers took a slightly different approach than the obvious one, but unfortunately that is not enough.Now, we start off with Pitt in prison and we are led to believe that the film will be of the ""Great Escape"" kind. But no, from then on and almost until the end of the film we are mostly fed flashbacks portraying Pitt's and Redford's past. In my point of view the film forgets about the story for almost two hours, and picks it up again just to wrap it up the last 20 minutes. The focus of the story is completely misplaced. Another bad side of this flashback technique is that the time span is 25 years. Both Pitt and Redford look exactly the same throughout this time span. I'm sorry, but that is not as easy to ignore as it was when the actors in Schindler's List were speaking English. Tony Scott has made a stylish film, but he spends too much energy on the technical aspects. The colors are very cold and this distances the viewer.
Redford and Pitt are both good and they save the movie from being completely uninteresting. I can't see why Redford's character had to be an agent just about to retire though. I wonder why every screenwriter seems to believe that all agents are about to retire.The ending of the film is good, and actually quite moving, but oh so late...Rating: 5/10",Spy Game
100,engelst,Utterly overrated piece of cinematographic trash,3,21 September 2004,"This movie is trite, meaningless, unlovingly, unconvincingly put together, counterfeit, plain bad, and from the starting material totally disappointing. If you look at Redford and Pitt you will notice though, that they both have proven on more than one occasion, either that they are not interested in the material or that they simply are not really good at smelling B-film material.The script for this film is so utterly boring, filled with stupid and risible clichés it is mind-boggling. The way top agents deliver headline news from 15-20 years ago as if they were discussing top secret actions is almost funny. Otherwise it is very hard to keep your attention on this film, as there are no details that are even remotely interesting.Humanly the storyline is also quite poor in development and credibility. This is in part the responsibility of the actors or should I say the casting director. As often with Pitt and maybe to a lesser degree Redford, there is no chemistry. The story suffers as we are supposed to believe that the people in this movie are intensely involved with one another.Apart from the script and the actors I was appalled by the lack of pace in some parts and the forced pace in others. Especially the start of the movie tries to pull us by the shirt when we haven't even begun to understand what the pooha is all about. This is because all the cinematographic tricks in this phase and also later on are unimaginatively thrown in without any freshness. The action becomes lame and feels forced.I switched at 3/4 and had fun with the last half of When Harry Met Sally. That one's worth my time, at least.",Spy Game

Lots of movies floating there in this typical subject of dirty politics and high end secret plots around CIA, FBI, NSA and so on. While many of those flicks are first class, Spy Game really stands out for its editing, fast pace, story line and overall intellect.The plot is rather simple. On his last day of service at the CIA Nathan Muir (Redford) comes to know about the capture of his once associate Tom Bishop (Pitt) in China. And that too in a crucial time when the US is in process of peace negotiations with its Asian counterpart. The CIA of course disavows Bishop and so the chinese force is about to execute him. Muir decides to free Bishop in less than 24 hours, and that too most of time just sitting in front of CIA officials who are hell bent to disown Bishop and declare ""we don't know him, we don't care"".Redford carries the whole movie on this shoulder, simply an outstanding performance. Pitt does his bit fittingly. Stephen Dillane suits the bill too.The flashbacks are smartly merged with current events. Characters built along with the story seamlessly. Great job Scott.

Thats what i call Robert Redford and Brad Pitt..They are so similar in their looks and mannerisms.. maybe Brad looks more like Bob in the Moneyball..but here.. in little shades.Now coming to the story.. Its a concoction of Spys, espionage's, misunderstandings.. and above all, Love and Righteousness. Why Love: Its what Brad does to show his love for the heroine..! Why Righteousness: Its what Bob does against all odds to jail-out his protégé..This movie has crispy and memorable dialogs, nuances of CIA games and very focused direction. I think this is Tony Scott's best film to date .. considering little action but more character understudy with a tightest plot. Fans of Bob and Brad are going to watch this movie more than few times like myself simply because its a Superbly laid out story with twists and turns never leaving you off the hook.. I wonder why they cast Catherine McCormack when there were so many better Irish/English actresses around. She looks mummified and sick..

It reminded me of the taught and intricate spy films of the 60s and 70s. Though implausible in many ways, the film stays true to itself, without any glaring plotholes or ""nobody would say THAT"" moments.However, I still think Tony Scott is better at style than substance. I wanted to feel for the characters, but I couldn't. I felt manipulated by the soundtrack; you know, when we're supposed to feel sad, they play the wailing woman music, when we're supposed to feel excited, they pump up the techno. It felt forced to me.

110,benntune,Great spy drama/thriller,8,31 August 2020,I've always believed Brad Pitt's best work has been as a supporting cast member and not the main character.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend if you like the genre.,Spy Game
111,db3,"If you love action and violence, this may be the film for you.",7,22 November 2001,"SPY GAMES   *___   Action/Drama Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, Catherine McCormackIn China, a CIA operative is caught and sentenced to death only 24 hours later. In the US, his handler (Redford) tries to convince CIA bosses to mount a rescue rather than just write him off. To that end, Redford describes all the missions this particular operative has been involved in. We get to see these as flashbacks. You know how James Bond movies start with a high-intensity adventure that lasts about five minutes? So does SPY GAME. In fact, all the different missions Redford describes have the look of one of those James Bond opening sequences. Lots of action, explosions, car chases, and violence. One sequence involves a truck loaded with explosives crashing into a terrorist headquarters. The 5-story building collapses just like the WTC.
And then there's the issue of Redford's appearance. In the present, Redford looks 70 years old. In the flashbacks, covering a span of 25 years, Redford looks 68. Brad Pitt doesn't age significantly, either. This movie has lots of steam and smoke. Maybe the producers got a deal on steam generators.
Not being a lover of action/violence, I came very close to walking out of this film. Usually, by the end of the first reel, the question of 'Where is this film headed?' is answered. SPY GAMES didn't answer that until the end. But having successfully tied the story together, I upgraded it to one star.",Spy Game

Turns out to be a dated piece of bragging (""oh, how cool is the U.S."" ; ""oh, how cool is Redford""). I say 'dated' in the geopolitical sense: even as late as 2001, most Americans rarely questioned U.S. supremacy, decency, cleverness, bravery, motherhood & apple pie. The reason I've always disliked Redford is his aura: ""I'm just the coolest, sharpest, low-key tough guy out there."" Lots of stereotypes in this movie.

Really this is Redford's show and he proves that he still has the charisma to carry a film on his aging shoulders. The storyline is somewhat predictable, but the ways that Redford outsmarts his CIA handlers is still entertaining. Robert Redford and Brad Pitt are well cast, and work well together, even though they seem quite out of place in the 1975 sequence in flashback (Redford looks far too old, and Pitt would have been only 12 at the time!). I really appreciate the way that the story was told in flashback, as it slows the pace down while drawing you much deeper into the plot. ""Spy Game"" is sure to go down as a classic modern thriller. Great study piece for the workings of the CIA and the compromises they do with the devil for the greater good. A good case in point at how people working there are at the mercy of the top CIA insiders. If you like these subject matters, this movie is for you. Not really into this stuff?

115,snake77,High quality Hollywood thriller,8,5 December 2001,"Spy Game is everything we're not supposed to expect from a major Hollywood movie: engrossing, intelligent, well written, acted and directed.  But that's just what it is and more, this is definitely the best thing I've seen since Memento.  Although Pitt is really good and Redford plays himself as well as he has in years, I think the most credit should go to Tony Scott. In the hands of a lesser director this could have been something more like Mission Impossible.  But Scott stays right on target, keeping us interested, developing the characters, and keeping the pacing nearly perfect.  Scott also shows us that he's stayed with the times: he employs the full array of modern camera tricks like fast motion, reverse zooms and funky lenses but in a way that actually makes the film better instead of being an annoying distraction.  The dialogue feels natural, all the actors do good work, no one tries to steal the show or be the star.  The story is interesting and almost never lapses into the kind of hyper violence or sappy sentimentality one has come to associate with modern studio pictures.  You get a feeling this is pretty close to how the CIA really operates, a place with fantastic technology at its disposal but who's ultimate effectiveness is determined by the fallible people who run the missions and take the chances.  I really enjoyed this film, I hope it's a sign of things to come and not a rarity.",Spy Game

117,shamsee,Would the real Tony Scott Please stand up!,9,18 April 2002,"I consider ""Top Gun"" to be be one of the top-notch movies of the 80s, and a modern Classic. I have lost count of times that I have watched it and every single time I have felt a jolt and and rush. This is why, every time I have watched a Tony Scott directed movie, I have always found myself pulling my hair as to how director of ""Top Gun"" make such horrible and mindless movies! How could he trick Robert De-Niro, one of the greatest actors of all time, to do a horrible flick like ""The Fan"". How could he blatantly try to repeat the formula for ""Top Gun"" in ""Days of Thunder"". Every time I watched Tony Scott movies, I vowed not to watch them again.So I feel lucky that I didn't know ""Spy Game"" was Tony Scott movie. I only got it cause of Redford and Pitt. When the movie began, and Tony Scott's name came up, I had already given up. When the plot didn't seem to go anywhere for a quiet a while, I told myself that's a lesson for me for not checking who the director was. Then something amazing happened! The movie started to look cool! Something in the movie started pulling me towards it. Something started to make me care for the fate of lead character, played by Brad Pitt. Then it got even better! Once we are told why hero is where he is, one has no choice but to view the whole movie, and every character in it in a whole new light! All of a sudden it becomes a powerful, beautiful, gripping, romantic epic!The gradual, and then a sudden transformation of characters is what grabbed my interest, and one goes from not really caring to not being able to relax! The most amazing quality of the movie is that its a twenty-four hour thriller, and yet one is introduced to the entire career of lead character. This leaves one with the feeling of watching an epic like Ben-Hur at the pace of Die-Hard!!! Its totally contradicting and unique feeling.The photography is just exceptional. The locations, the sets are totally convincing. The acting by all the characters is just awesome. The screen-play is great. Not a single dialogue is wasted! The whole atmosphere is just totally cool! The ending is perfect!!!I forgive Tony Scott for tormenting us with his work since ""Top Gun"". Maybe it wasn't his fault at all, and it was that jack-ass, Jerry Buckheimer who was the producer on most of those projects, and whose influence effected the talents and performance of Tony Scott. Hope he manages to stay away from Buckheimer in future! This movie is not just a good movie, but a GREAT movie! It is amazingly powerful movie, as it grabs you and moves you.

118,amahlanand,"""It's how the game plays you""",9,26 May 2012,"The pressing question which we can address first is, what elevates this above your average espionage thriller? The answer is twofold, it isn't just about the plot, where the backstory involves many angles and frame stories but also, the game being played and the way it transpires; something which is every bit as thrilling from a political perspective as it is physical. This film is a real separation between the people who walk the walk and talk the talk in contrast with those who don't. No doubt who wins.In one of his definitive modern roles, Robert Redford's playing of the corporate, political game and the means by which his character, Nathan Muir, influences the state of play is the stand out. In many ways, I felt this acted as quite the satire on bureaucracy and corporate politics, driven by Muir, who isn't your run of the mill administrator but a shrewd, wily facilitator and occasionally, cunning manipulator. On one occasion, Muir tells someone in jest albeit with a poker face that the person has something in their teeth. The vigour with which the person checks gives an idea of the man's powerful persuasive abilities but is also a reflection of the way he takes control of the game. Redford is so slick in how he carries this out that you are either chuckling at or left enamoured by his cleverness.The revolution around the mentor-pupil relationship defines the film. Redford and Brad Pitt function so inadvertently and naturally well. It's all about them within the bigger picture and they are a flawless team. Arguably either a protagonist or deuteragonist, depending on which way you look at it, Pitt takes on this role in a way that he is so dedicated and full of zeal for his craft but his conflicting morals and allegiance enhance both his credibility as a character and commendability for substantiating this into more than a shallow, spy role. Muir's morals may waver but his loyalty and honour do not. And that, on the whole, Is one of the nicest aspects of this movie, attaching a humanely side to stereotypically nameless, faceless people without an identity who belong to an institution of political secrets. Not to mention adding in some enthralling side play along the way. This probably does overstate the powers and capabilities of a man in such a high pressure, highly strung environment but its entertaining nonetheless leaving aside the acceptable exaggeration. This is as much about people as it is about countries, groups and other larger demographics. It certainly has a more individual touch than you would expect from a spy thriller and scripting which does not employ the usual suspects. It's a mix of action, suspense, politics and sly humour which progresses in a manner keeping you on the edge of your seat.",Spy Game

There was a few, high-tech camera work seems, that made me feel like I was watching swordfish, but I didnt get worked up about it cause I new the story was going somewhere.

I was a little turned off by this at first, but only for a few minutes. Then the movie had my full attention. Pretty soon, I genuinely cared about the characters played well by Brad Pitt and Robert Redford. (Redford steals the show.) Redford's character always keeps one step ahead of his CIA buddies, and I loved watching him do it. The relationship between Redford and Pitt is a student-teacher one, not father-son one. This works, but I think the movie could have done with a LITTLE more of the father-son thing.This movie is more of a think-piece than it looked in previews, so anybody expecting brainless action will probably be disappointed.

Where do we start with the rest: if Brad Pit had been a tasty young hunk in 1992 how could he have also been a hardened assassin in Viet Nam, probably before he'd had time to have been born. How come the folk's in Beirut were chatting on cell-phones in 1982, years before they were available in the rest of the world, and when a car phone was literally that, a phone that required a car to move it!

Not only did it simmer well but she looked not a day older after ten years in a Chinese prison! Then that rescue.Who but an idiot would imagine that a p3 in the CIA has the authority to authorise an act of war on China! And if they did, only two choppers! And clapped out 40 year old old Huey's, when the USMC have been flying Black Hawk's since the Eighties. A stupid error made all the more glaring by the pilot of one referring to his machine as ""Black Hawk One."" Oh, I geddit, they are the same two Huey's they used in the Viet Nam scenes. Or maybe they are meant to be THE SAME TWO HUEYS that appeared in those scenes. You see, I don't know, in a film this full of temporal worm-holes anything is possible! Or maybe they should have spent more money on hiring choppers and less on the ridiculous overblown sound-track with its tiresome clichés comprising plaintiff choirboy's and Arabian vocal pirouettes and a clumsy abuse of themes from Vaughn-Williams.As you may well imagine, my only reason for sticking to the end of this film was to see what more ""howlers"" were in store.It seems to have been written by a twenty-something with an absolutely shameful and absolute ignorance of anything before the present.

Moreover, there are several ridiculous plot developments which drag the movie down. In the end it's an extremely simplistic story : friendship is stronger than 'the rules' and self-interest. So much ado about very little, and moreover the film is told in a fairly confusing way, making it seem more complex than it really is. Redford is good, Pitt blah as always.

The poverty and violent chaos ring true, one can only imagine, as a precursor of the cult of suicide that made the attacks of September 11 possible. Chilling, and worth the price of admission. Now, as for the depiction of a clandestine U.S. assault on Communist China, well...shut your eyes or your brain on that little detail.",Spy Game

130,matjpi,Mostly interesting and entertaining,7,31 March 2012,"A fast paced thriller like this with lots of background needs some careful setting up and there wasn't much sophistication in the way it was done, but it worked surprisingly well considering.As others have pointed out, there were some pedestrian errors in the props and sets not to mention Tom Bishop's (Brad Pitt) apparently ageless body. Not the director's fault, though he should have spotted at least some of these. Timelines were skewed and there were some glaring historical errors.The ambitious Charles Harker (Stephen Dillane) drove the plot forward with force so we could compare that with Muir's (Redford) delicate, more productive touch. Muir and Harker had some interesting interplay which was cleverly written, well acted and nicely presented with great camera work, kudos to Tony Scott. Elizabeth Hadley (Cat McCormack) was an effective spanner in the works as the ambiguous go-between though I feel that Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) took a big risk to get her back when, in a few months she could be back in Beirut. Bishop's difficulty with the harsh realities of his work were a bit thin: he must have known the risks he was taking not just for himself but for others in any way connected with him. Muir's rooftop warning seemed a little late, Muir had more faith in his protégé than he possibly deserved perhaps, but it was well phrased, well delivered and the filming of it worked exceptionally well for its novelty. (According to the DVD extras, Tony Scott stumped up $50k of his own money to pay for the helicopter to film that scene when the backers refused). Robert Redford consistently performs well. Whilst I don't feel he has much range (he's pretty much always Redford in any role) he makes up for it with intelligent shading of nuance. Brad Pitt gets by in a wooden way (nothing normally against him; in Interview With The Vampire, he and Cruise were outstanding) but this role called for nothing more than his usual bag of tricks.An entertaining film with a nice balance of pacey action and thoughtful dialogue.",Spy Game
131,deadkerouac,Engaging spy thriller from start to finish,8,6 December 2001,"SPY GAME, the latest film from veteran director Tony Scott (CRIMSON TIDE, ENEMY OF THE STATE, and the modern classic TOP GUN) and screenwriter Michael Frost Beckner (who wrote the so-so SNIPER and the horrible CUTTHROAT ISLAND), is one of the best spy films in recent years. Scott shies away from full-blown action here, instead building tension through longtime CIA operative Nathan Muir's (aptly played by Robert Redford) assessment of an old pupil, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt).Bishop, recently (the film, however, is set in 1991) imprisoned after a failed mission, is due to be executed at 8 a.m. EST. Muir is called upon to give intimate details of Bishop's life to, among others, CIA suits Troy Folger (Larry Bryggman, late of DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE) and Charles Harker (Stephen Dillane), Muir's main adversary. Why so important? The United States and China are due for trade talks the very day Bishop is to be executed.Muir and Bishop's relationship is detailed in flashbacks, from their first meeting in Vietnam in the early 1970s, where Bishop, fresh out of Hemet, California, is a rookie sniper with three confirmed kills. After Bishop survives Vietnam, he moves on to West Germany as a clerk, until Muir, in a chance meeting, decides to introduce Bishop into the world of espionage. In a fine touch, Bishop learns from the wise Muir in a cornucopia of images.Early on, Bishop learns the thin line between the world of espionage and real life during a mission in Berlin. Muir later tells him on a rooftop, ""If you go off the reservation, I won't come after you."" As the film moves on, however, Muir learns that Bishop may not be worthwhile to the CIA, and may not be rescued, thereby enlisting the help of his secretary, Gladys (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), friend Harry Duncan (David Hemmings), and others to save his friend's life. The real story lies in 1985 Beirut, when Bishop, undercover as a photographer, meets Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack), a Londoner working as a relief worker in the wartorn city. Though their relationship is never truly founded as we would like, this is Muir's story and not Bishop's. This, however, ultimately hurts any true growth of Bishop's character. Redford, then, makes Muir shine. It is in Beirut, therefore, that makes Muir change his mind about saving Bishop.The flashbacks, especially Vietnam and Beirut, are wonderfully captured on film by cinematographer Daniel Mindel (who also did Scott's ENEMY OF THE STATE). Scott fleshes out all the supporting characters nicely, though, yes, this is Redford's film. Highly recommended to those who enjoy the likes of Tom Clancy. 8/10NOTE: As a San Diego Padres fan, I must point out that there is a goof in the film (I have notified IMDb of this also). In Beirut in 1985, Bishop, from Hemet, California, near Riverside, is wearing the blue San Diego Padres baseball cap with white and orange lettering. This is an anachronism: the Padres still wore their brown and yellow uniforms in 1985, and didn't replace them with the blue, white, and sometimes gray uniforms until new ownership in 1990. The brown and yellow cap is not hard to find.",Spy Game

There are no cool gadgets, no handful of dirty women to sleep with, no amazing cars to drive around. In fact, most of the movie takes place inside an office as Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) tells a story about Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) and himself when they used to do spy stuff together between Vietnam and the collapse of the Berlin Wall.Great plot, interesting turns in it, and both Redford and Pitt play well together. I especially like how Nathan takes Tom under his wing, like a father figure, while he teaches him everything that he knows about being a spy. There is quite a realistic portrayal of the violence and death that is involved with that field of work as well. It's not as glamorous and cool as most movies make it out to be.My only complaint about the movie is the fact that Bishop, who supposedly serves as a sniper in Vietnam under the command of Muir, looks exactly the same age, forty years later, during the ""current event"" timing of the movie. He doesn't age at all and it was very noticeable and annoying while I was viewing the film.Oh, not sure what was edited out for the TV version, other than some language, but the original has language and content to make it R-rated, FYI.

The whole movie reminded me of Sydney Pollack/Robert Redford spy-against-his-will-movie ""Three days of the Condor"".

But for a film to impress me, it has to have more than two good actors, there has to be a decent plot in there somewhere, something to keep me interested, i think the reason i liked this so much is because while it does focus on politics, it focuses a lot more on Nathan and Toms relationship, which is the strong point of the film , whenever the two of them interact in the film, it comes to life, they have a great on screen chemistry with each other and they are helped by a good script.

143,FlorianSchirner,"Intelligent thriller, worthy of Le Carré",9,3 April 2008,"This is what an intelligent and entertaining Spy movie should look like. And I don't mean the ""Super-Spy"" genre with its gadgets and sly wit. In contrary. This is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes. In short it revolves around a young CIA agent (Pitt) who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved (McCormack) from a Chinese prison. He gets captured and will be executed a few days later. 24 hours before the execution the CIA learns from his capture and, a presidential visit and trade talks ahead, decide to burn the rogue agent. They contact his recruiter and mentor (Redford) to fill them in on the young agent. This he does. Between these flashback scenes the senior agent uses all his wile he gained as a field agent to set his protegé free. The plot twists several times in unexpected ways and the tricks Redford uses in his scheme are simply great. The fine scene from ""Clear and present danger"", where Ford tries to outsmart his fellow deputy director are but a mere faded memory from this scheming. The directing utilizes modern fast paced cutting and editing, but mostly in scenes where there is action. Unlike many other movies using these methods, here it enhances the film instead ruining it (I regret watching the otherwise great movie ""Man under Fire""). Speaking of action, if you expect an action packed spy movie like the fore-mentioned ""Clear and present danger"", you'll be disappointed. The only shooting involves a bunch of soldiers (first Vietcong, later on US Marines) and is only mere background. Most of the suspense is created verbally and the movie is filled to the brim with adrenaline rising suspense. The acting is very strong, especially Redford and Pitt, which seem to have developed a great chemistry. Having worked together before may have helped. But Redford definitely dominates the movie. His scenes are more than intense and when he unpacks his most dangerous weapon, his smile (in the scene when the nasty superior thinks he has nailed Redford) it is most memorable. I think this is one of his strongest acting.

He plays an essentially duplicitous CIA agent with such charm that we of course convince ourselves that he is just a patriot doing his job. It's vogue again to have the ends justify the means.Pitt gets all the action stuff and little to do in the acting department, but that's all-right, he's pretty. He also gets to play the moral character who doesn't like people being treated like pawns, even though he does it!
The Beirut sequence hits very close to home, and is probably one of the more intense action scenes in any Hollywood movie. We've seen this before from people like DePalma, but after 9-11-01 were not just casual observers.
Discerning eyes will notice that practically all the actors, save our intrepid heroes, are British (""ooh 'Secrets and Lies', ooh 'Masterpiece Theater'"").

Robert Redford comes out of seclusion every couple of years to do a few movies, almost as if to remind everyone that he's still around.  His recent efforts (including the Last Castle) had not (in my opinion) been anything to write home about. This one is.  Brad Pitt does an excellent job as well.  I hope that he will take more roles such as this in the future, and leave movies like ""The Mexican"" to lesser lights.  The ONLY problems I had with this movie are a pair of anachronisms that would be apparent only to a select few.  Firstly, Brad Pitt wears a San Diego Padres hat during the film, in the Lebanon Segment, that was set in 1985.  The Padres hat he wears is a modern one, not the one worn by the team back in '85.  Clips from ""Baywatch"" are shown, including Baywatch icon, Pamela Anderson.  This was set in 1991.  Anderson wasn't on the show until 1992.

The political infighting and sniping that is almost everything that happens at Langley accurately shows how badly CIA has deteriorated from the peak of it's powers in the 1960s. 
By the time this film takes place (ca 1991) CIA is mostly concerned with not getting caught in the same room as an opinion (which is easy with satellite pictures and signal intercepts since they can be interpreted in so many ways), and messy HUMINT people like Muir and Bishop (that can verify their other sources) are viewed as dangerous dinosaurs.  Small wonder then that on 9/11 CIA was busy making diversity quilts, having been forbidden to use foreign agents by Willie Jeff two years before, and fact-found into impotence by nearly twenty years of Congressional interference into matters they knew nothing about.The time line in the film is all screwed up (the last US combat troops pulled out of Vietnam by 1973), but we've seen a lot worse (like The English Patient).  Redford is better than average (here he actually tried to fill a role, not make a statement).  Pitt is showing some more versatility.  Like most Redford movies it's just a little too long, but not as bad as ""Horse Whisperer"" or a few others.",Spy Game
162,Troopie,When will Hollywood do its homework?,1,14 June 2004,"This film had such potential & the acting wasn't bad -- although I still yearn to see Redford extend his acting repertoire by playing a bad guy! The basic plot, involving a world-weary veteran spy going out on a limb for his protégé, may not be original but is still pretty sound and also filled with potential. However, the shameful number of errors (as listed on another part of this site) & the unbelievable ending (which would make John Wayne blush) all contribute to make this the sort of film that would help you to sleep on a long flight. It does have its moments, although its premise that the old CIA was some sort of 'Lone Ranger' is hard to swallow. (Note the oxymoron on the certificate of appreciation Redford gets from the Director acknowledging his ""30 years of honorable service"" -- since when has the spy game been considered honorable, even by those whose career it is! To sum up, if 'Spy Kids' was too intellectually challenging for you, then maybe you'll enjoy this film. Otherwise, if your rental store has only 2 videos/DVDs, this & one showing paint dry, choose the paint!",Spy Game

164,saykeng,Quite a good thriller...more of an expose on some dirty tricks of CIA operatives!,8,12 August 2006,"It is refreshing to watch an older Robert Redford pitting his acting skills against a younger Brad Pitt in this spy thriller movie. Both of them acted very well despite the sketchy plot.To me, the storyline is pretty straight-forward: A retiring CIA operative, Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) learned that his protégé, Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), had been arrested in China as a result of a botched rescue attempt of his girl-friend. He was due to be executed shortly. Because of vested interests, CIA refused to mount a rescue. Out of friendship, Muir engineered a successful but unauthorized rescue.The entire movie is beautifully choreographed through black & white flash-backs & pure dialog, during which Muir recalled his personal encounter & close friendship with his protégé. That relationship spanned across a time line of about twenty years, from the Vietnam War in the 70's, to the end of the cold war in Berlin during the 80's & then to the mean streets of Beirut in the 90's.The movie moves on to show how Muir had taught Bishop all the skills (or dirty tricks?) of spycraft...how to case a restaurant, fix a radio,...to be callous, look at the big picture...to stay remote...to sell out people if that's of use...to kill.There is no typical high-octane action sequences in this spy thriller movie, except for a heart-pounding escape scene in a China prison.Throughout the movie, one can see how Muir had to use his wits & all the skills (or dirty tricks?) he had learned while working for the CIA to out-smart the CIA's top echelon as well as his fellow CIA operatives to mount a personally-financed rescue mission.I really enjoyed watching his brilliant machinations as he moved from scene to scene in the movie. I just loved the part where he juxtaposed CIA satellite images to fool his bosses. He even forged the signature of the CIA Director. At the end of it, all of them apparently did not have the slightest clue as to what was happening & had happened.On the whole, I have enjoyed watching this spy thriller. It is also comforting to know that an accomplished Singaporean actor, Adrian Pang, had a small role in the movie. He played a medic during the botched rescue attempt.",Spy Game
165,nastja97,The ideal action movie,10,28 September 2012,"I can't see why some people find Spy Game boring. It is one of the most exciting movies I have ever seen - keeps you thrilled from beginning to end! And at the same time it's one of the funniest. My whole family adores Redford's Nathan Muir and his dry humor (such as ""Every time my coach told me that, I knew I was about to get benched"").Of course, some scenes in the movie can be frightening for someone - shootings, bombings and so on. But they are not too graphic, so I think for people who like action/crime/spy movies, it is all just fine.The setting of action in several completely different countries adds a lot of color and brightness to the movie.And... last but not least... there is the romance of Tom and Elizabeth. Although for a major part of the movie it is in the background, it always appears in time to remind the characters (and also the watchers) that there is more in this life than the CIA's cold rules and calculations.",Spy Game
166,walion,One of the most exhilarating spy movies in the recent years.,8,10 January 2016,"This is quite a movie, I'd say. A movie that yanks you in the depths of the very spy games and the insides of CIA. A movie that grips you and refuses to let you go until the final whistle. 126 minutes of pure exultation and suspense that holds you at the edge of your seat, mingled with top-notch screenplay from the director of Top Gun - Tony Scott.This is the story of a retiring CIA agent Nathan Muir (The marvelous Robert Redford), who's trying to free his old friend Tom Bishop (The flamboyant Brad Pitt) from a Chinese prison, which he trained to become an infallible spy. When Nathan finds out that Tom is captured and tortured in China for espionage, he tries to work ways out to get him out of there alive. That's where the spy game begins.The CIA is trying to hide from the world that they have a captured spy in Chinese territory and they put no efforts to get him back, but exactly the opposite, they want him killed. Nathan's cunning mind and the contacts that he's made throughout the years will eventually help him get closer to saving his friend.The movie is very well-paced, you're brain is forced to work all through the movie in order to realize what's really happening, because of the fast changing scenarios. It's a real well-made movie about one man standing up to his friend and his own morals against the system that crushes everyone in its path.This is a movie plentiful of ravishing A-one actors, unified with a rigorous script with all its amazing details. A spy movie that everyone should watch.",Spy Game

Robert Red Ford is his usual brilliant self as the master spy master on his last day before retirement, but Brad Pitt mainly phones in one might be one of his worst attempts at acting.

If only Tony had been there to direct Moses.Redford can carry a movie like few others and I was happy to see Brad Pitt put to good use, too. The scenes in Vietnam, East Germany and Beirut were unexceptionally great, too.There was remarkably little sentimentality or the all-too-common romantic add-ons in the story. An almost-British cynicism did a favor for the movie. Why I only give eight points is because of the ending. The trump card is a bit too thick, but still quite passable. I was happier with the storyline than the finale, but the latter is good enough.",Spy Game
169,O.N.,Average,6,12 January 2003,"Despite pairing together two Hollywood heavyweights in Robert Redford and Brad Pitt, ""Spy Game"" never manages to escape from mediocrity.
Redford and Pitt play CIA agents with Redford the experienced professional and Pitt his young understudy recruited during the Vietnam War. The duo fall out and separate during one of their assignments, until Pitt many years later blows one of his missions and ends up being thrown into a Chinese prison. With Pitt set to be executed for espionage in 24 hours, it's up to Redford on hs last day before retirement (how many times hasn't that been used before???? ie Lethal Weapon 3) to save his former companion from the Chinese and the rest of the CIA who don't want to get involved.It's fascinating to see the long winded plan Redford concocts from his office to save Pitt without his overzealous superiors finding out. Without a doubt, the unfolding of this plot is the highlight of ""Spy Game"". Unfortunately, in order to make this work, much time is needed to be spent on flashbacks showing the forging of Pitt and Redford's relationships, and their relationship with a mysterious woman (Catherine McCormack) who comes between them. After a while, this becomes downright tedious and is drawn out much longer than necessary.Also a little difficult to ascertain is the motives of Robert Redford's character. At one point he shows little remorse in accidentally killing 70 civilians in order to complete a mission, but then gives up his entire retirement savings and risks possible litigation to save one person. Redford is nevertheless not too bad, and neither is Pitt despite little screen time, but a bit tighter scripting may have helped both of them elevate this film.As a side note, although ""Spy Game"" is advertised as an action movie, there is precious little action to be seen. Director Tony Scott seems to be trying more to make a ""thinking man's"" flick, which is probably not his forte and doesn't particularly suit his stylised direction with fast forward sequences and drained out colours (very similar to the way his brother Ridley shot ""Black hawk Down""). Overall, don't expect to see anything overly remarkable with ""Spy Game"". It's good enough to pass the time as a Saturday afternoon rental, but it certainly won't be a film you'll be discussing for days afterward.6/10",Spy Game

171,cjdouglas,"Espionage, thrills, who could ask for more?",8,25 January 2002,"This was a very good Hollywood thriller to me. The history behind Redford and Pitt's character was well thought out and depicted on the big screen.
Redford hasn't lost his on-screen charisma and was indeed convincing as Muir. I like the fact that the director worked the tension between him and his colleagues so well that it kept me on the edge of my seat and firmly engrossed in the film. What I didn't really care for was the reasoning for Pitt being put in the Chinese prison. Sort of turning it into a love story didn't really turn my crank. why oh why does Hollywood always have to put some romance in a movie that doesn't really need it?Good on the building tension meter. The conflict in Lebanon was so tangible with the all the fighting and the bombing, it felt real.
On the whole, this was a very good spy thriller with some great acting and a somewhat interesting premise behind it. Hats off to Redford and Pitt for pulling off a rather convincing portrayal of mentor and student.",Spy Game

175,douglasbrewer-74526,For fans of Redford and Pitt this is a great second coming,7,26 February 2019,"This is a nice little thriller film starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. Directed by Tony Scott who loves to use technology all out, Spy Game, however, fails to be a great film. This is a fairly interesting -- if almost hopelessly complex -- CIA picture that gets ratcheted to the stratosphere by director Tony Scott's near-romantic infatuation with his own technical abilities. You can more or less forgive him during action sequences, even though truly gifted directors know how to shoot even those with restraint. But Scott films every scene, no matter how routine, as if he's covering the launch of a nuclear missile. Both Pitt and Redford are good, and their similar appearance and look will not go unnoticed. The soundtrack, especially the main techno theme is pretty good though. All in all a good thriller.",Spy Game
176,logos1,Enjoyable and thrilling escapism,7,23 November 2010,"I just watched this movie again on Netflix and was reminded how much I liked it. Robert Redford turns in one of his better later performances and is a believable character as the CIA field agent Nathan Muir on his last day. Brad Pitt, too, gives one of his better turns as Tom Bishop, an operative recruited by Muir with growing disillusionment.The two of them are reason enough to watch this. In typical Scott fashion, the story moves fairly quickly and the camera angles border on producing motion sickness as they swirl around the characters (much like scenes from Man on Fire). If you watch this without thinking too much about it but rather allow yourself to get caught up in the finer points of the story, you will find the movie to be an enjoyable diversion.However, the film cannot rise above 7 out of 10 because the story itself does not bear up under anything resembling close inspection. The goofs that are chronicled on this site give a pretty good accounting of the things that undermine the story's believability. You don't have to follow world events very closely to know that the U.S. never had an embassy in Hong Kong (or in West Berlin, not technically ever a part of West Germany, for that matter). For those who speak German, using Hungarians to pose as ""Vopos"" (Volkspolizei - East German Police) is a disappointment. From the goofs, apparently those facile in Chinese will also be disappointed.You can dwell on such things and allow them to spoil the movie for you. However, if you chose to overlook the absurdities, this is an enjoyable tale with compelling characters.",Spy Game
177,hapiores,this is a whole different game...,9,31 March 2005,"There are many reasons why we like a movie or not. For me, this is the case in witch small things were enough to like it: the two main actors, the places in which the action occurs, and the fact that it has more to do with a love affair, in a tragic atmosphere than about spies. Well, of course this is about spies - two of them - and mostly about the relation between them; if they are similar enough to understand each other, they are also different enough to generate some tension in the relation. Maybe this is more about how the characters move around each others than about action or intrigue. In fact this is so obvious that the way in which the story is told is mostly in flashback, with Muir (Robert Redford) introducing all of them and narrating part. So, the story is the story and the spy game is what Muir does within the CIA, in 24 hours or so. The distinction is important because if you think of this as a traditional spy movie (maybe like the Bourne Identity or Supremacy) it has two obvious flaws for the genre: the plot is very simple (maybe predictable) and there's no bad guy, no one to kill or to revenge; there's also almost no genuine action, and, as far as I can remember, Bishop (Brad Pitt) only fires one weapon in the whole movie. Maybe what mislead most of the people was the title of the movie, and maybe that's why most of them didn't like it. However, in my opinion, this is a very good movie, with strong leading roles and a compelling story. No gadgets, no arms, no villains, no action...oh, no,this is a whole different game, and it's a serious and a dangerous game: the game of people and their relations.",Spy Game

For any fan of Brad Pitt, this movie is a must. His portray of the frustrated Vietnam vet behind a desk in Germany is well done. Robert Redford is never bad and excels as well.

181,BryMan-4,An exercise in style over substance,6,20 November 2001,"Spy Game is a movie that takes a roundabout way to get to the point.  The story is simple:  Robert Redford, on the day before retiring from the CIA, must try to save Brad Pitt, his protégé, from being executed for espionage by the Chinese authorities.  Redford has 24 hours to talk and connive his way around senior CIA officials who are willing to sacrifice Pitt for the good of trade talks.  The film is mostly told in flashbacks.  We see flashbacks of Redford convincing Pitt to join the CIA.  We see Pitt on his first assignment.  We see Pitt on the assignment that lead to this incident. In between, we see Redford in an intense meeting with the clock ticking. Not all of what we're seeing is related to the story at hand, but, like a trail, it's testimony to the relationship between Redford and Pitt and Pitt's own work ethic (if you can use the word `ethic' when referring to the CIA).  For that reason, you sometimes wish they'd just get on with it. Remember, though, we are entering the Christmas season where movies are all about length and `character development' because the Academy likes both.Redford does a marvelous job.  You get the sense that his character is reveling in this final challenge the day before retiring.  He conducts himself with a surefire cockiness and a knowing smirk that gives him the upper hand.  You sense he is going to miss the business a great deal. Pitt, on the other hand, does his darnedest.  It just isn't always enough.  As an actor, he lacks the intensity of peers like Sean Penn or Edward Norton.  He just can't find the right note like he did so brilliantly in Fight Club, a role much more suited to his surfer-dude-cum-actor demeanor.  Pitt even sabotages one scene by turning to the camera and making a silly, bored face.Orchestrating all of this is director Tony (Top Gun, Enemy of the State) Scott.  And I use the word orchestrating literally.  Scott uses gels and color lens filters quite liberally to create mood and ambience.  He employs snazzy camera movements and freeze-frames that are reminiscent of the 60s cinema.  Scott stages violence like other directors would stage a Wagnerian opera.  The shot of a hotel in Beirut exploding is stunning.  The camera slows down just a little to give you the full effect of the destruction while the music swells over the sound of the explosion.Sometimes movies are exercises in style over substance and Spy Game is just such a movie.  See it for the artistry of Redford's performance and Scott's direction.  As for the substance, you'll be disappointed that all of these characters and resources were used for an absolutely frivolous mission.",Spy Game

He does an excellent job of appearing normal and not star struck. Robert Redford is excellent in his ability to draw you into his character and wonder what he is thinking throughout the movie. Redford is even better at appearing smart and witty than he was in 3 Days of The Condor. Both actors have charm and a flare for making simple situations more complex witch adds depth to the movie.The flow of the movie is smooth and has a lot of dialog witch i love. The Double-Story-Simultianity is very smart and entertaining- the story between Brad Pitt's and Redford's past, and the current story line of Redford working against the government and trying to save Pitt from execution. The plot isn't spoon fed to you, so it leaves you guessing as to what is going on and which way the movie will go but at the same time it gives you enough information that you don't ever get confused.The cinematography is very entertaining and not boring. The acting of the government employees was excellent and very believable. The scenes of Redford talking with the officials is very smart and captivating as you try and figure out what is going on in the heads of all involved.Over all this movie has good light action, good plot, smart and entertaining actors, smart dialog and good cinematography.

183,Nyagtha,Will Smith and Gene Hackman - pah!,9,5 December 2001,"I went to the cinema last night having no idea what to watch knowing with deafening certainty I was not going to wander into any of the Harry Potter screenings. After deciding against Zoolander I opted to go and see Spy Game. I certainly enjoyed Enemy of the State - even for a film with Will Smith in it. However as Spy Game opened I knew this was a different league altogether. For a start it is much darker - there are lots of interiors of prisons, dank German cafes and Bosnian Streets - the plot is a lot less fantasical and before I go any further - the soundtrack was stunning. It alternated between high octane guitars and electronic beats to quiet piano moments to huge orchestral expanses. This really helped the atmosphere of the film, especially in the Bosnian scenes. If you are looking for an alternative to Harry Potter before LOTR comes out I cannot reccomend this strongly enough. Robert Redford is very good as the CIA agent about to retire and equally Brad Pitt as the rebellious agent who works for Redford. If I have one criticism of the film and I think that it is important to have - it is that you cannot take your concentration off the action for one second. I dropped some popcorn, uttered, ""Where has that gone?"" and returned to my viewing to find I had to retrack to find out what was going on.But it is this fast pace of events which ensure you don't realise it runs for over two hours. I know it is a false hope but this film deserves so much more attention that Harry Potter.",Spy Game

There's nothing you haven't seen before in other films of this genre, but there's enough subterfuge and daring-do to hold up the interest level. Robert Redford and Brad Pitt play CIA operatives, Redford the jaded older mentor and Pitt the younger more impulsive wild card. The film fractures a bit as it tracks their somewhat tempestuous relationship through Vietnam, Berlin and Beirut (supposedly 20 years in a high stress job and they didn't seem to age!) but then pulls back together at the end.

It also has two big stars in it who are good actors (even if Pitt seems to be in auto-pilot for this one).

It's even got the stereotypical old spy saying ""We used to be able to tell who the good guys and the bad guys were.""

There is amazing shots and an entire scene on the roof of a building that seems so surreal it's cool. Which is the fault of intense director Tony Scott.  We add a contagious soundtrack, ultra spy environments, events that would fit into history, and spies that have no respect for to humanity, we would have what seems to be a reality based movie.  Now the con's.  Okay this movie is predictable.  It's a spy movie.  I don't want an ending I know from the start, I want an ending that satisfied all the answers that were swimming in my head, yet somehow evaded explanation. This did not happen in this movie.  Everything was obvious,  although Redford's performance did fool many.  And my other problem, they  didn't use Brad Pitt enough.  He is immensely talented, and they used him to demonstrate how much pain one person can take for the right reasons.  The plot alone justifies that, Pitt was not allowed to demonstrate his character.  He can be so cool and so unbelievable in roles.  This didn't happen here.But all in all I gave it a 10- what is the point of something actually being truly perfect.  The film was great and very impressive and entertaining. Great waste of time.",Spy Game

Robert Redford's Nathan Muir was a good mix of understanding the complex ""game"" he played for life and also had enough humanity to not make him simply an evil spy.  Brad Pitt's Tom Bishop seemed a little idealistic to actually be a ""spy"", but he played the role quite well.  Catherine McCormack's role was mostly limited, however she portrayed her slightly over-zealous character without being over-zealous with her acting.  Stephen Dilland as Harker was perfect at being able to keep a smarmy face on for just about the entire movie. Matthew Marsh played the sympathetic Dr. Byars with a respectful, understated quality.  Lots of good ""spy"" stuff going on and enough action to keep you busy.  7 of 10.",Spy Game

But again, we have a low budget production with too many familiar UK locations (the CIA HQ looked like a local Comp., the Chinese jail WAS actually an old prison in Yorkshire) and it was populated by British c-list actors ('Stephen' from Coronation Street, that chap from the Carlsberg ad and the mad guy from Banzai) with appalling American accents. The one decent Brit actor, Marianne Baptiste (from Mike Leigh's 'Secrets & Lies') was consigned to the role of wry-humoured secretary to Robert 'Bus pass' Redford.And how we laughed at the sub-Top-Gun script written, it would appear, by a committee of crazed Baywatch fans: ""we need this like we need a third tit!"", ""you must be f***ing crazy!"", ""you're worried the lid's gonna come down with your hand in the cookie jar"". The whole ruse of lining up a series of flashbacks (Nam sortie, Eastern Bloc escapade etc) against the countdown to Brad Pitt's final clash with a ketchup bottle was unbelievable, unengaging and cheap. Bob shuffled around with his zimmer frame whilst Brad looked mildly more animated & modelled various hairstyles & sunglasses from across the ages.We stayed to the bitter end and were rewarded with more cheese, cliches and some great shots of the Thames Valley and Guildford (?) multi-storey car park.The director is Tony Scott - Ridley's brother - but he sadly shares none of his financial clout, cinematographic eye or ear for good dialogue.

Redford gives a the usual Redford performance, thats a good thing!  Pitt gives a decent performance as well but not one of his best (12 Monkeys, Fight Club, Snatch, Seven)- even considering he is not the main character. One thing about this film that I found quite annoying was Scott's use of the 'Pan-Around and STOP-Jerk-Quick Zoom-In' as it also was in Enemy of The State.If you like typical Scott films you will probably enjoy this one as well.

In Spy Game the training, the setting up, the eventual execution of plans take forever.  Everyone, good guys and bad guys alike, looks painfully dubious about the effectiveness and/or the morality of actions contemplated.  After 30 seconds of this, each one just falls in line and does what he was considering in the first place.  There is so much mystery about who is on whose side and what the relations are, and for what? Some terrorist is almost accidentally blown up and the a couple of semi-competent agents have to be sprung from prison.  Everything in the movie points to Big Deal while the viewer keeps wondering who these people are, what are they doing that matters, and why should we care?I can't help compare this Redford movie with The Last Castle where scenes are so quietly underplayed as everyday occurrences but the issues of leadership, loyalty, and competence are brought out thoughtfully and forcefully.",Spy Game

209,pachrick,Pure gibberish,3,29 November 2001,"Really terrible plot/ storyline and only mediocre acting. The writer obviously 'borrowed' some ideas from well known books and other movies (ie. the training exercise where Pitt has to appear in the balcony of a window is taken from a book about a Mossad officer (and possibly other sources)), and the facts are not accurate (ie. Embassy bombing in Lebanon where 211 civilians killed in mid 1980's? Maybe they're thinking of the Marine barracks that were bombed and 245 Marines were killed.)Besides all of that, the story just drags on with no real purpose. The idea is that Pitt has been captured by the Chinese in an attempt to free some political prisoner. The CIA wants to know what Pitt was doing when he got captured and then decide what to do about it - ignore/ deny it or try to help him. The whole movie is then just Redford rambling on about how he met Pitt, recruited, trained, and worked with him. None of this would seem to have a bearing on the alleged plot.Story line had many flaws as well (BEWARE - spoilers ahead): Why would a highly trained and experienced spy (Pitt) make a stupid mistake like giving chewing gum to some unknown prisoner during a dangerous mission?(Why would he even have gum with him?); Why would Pitt risk his life to save this woman he only barely knew some 6 years previous and who left him with only a 'Dear John' letter (as far as he knew)?; Why would Redford throw away his life savings/ retirement house in the Bahamas and risk jail time to get Pitt out of prison when they didn't even like each other and hadn't spoken in the past 6 years (not to mention Redford's 'rules' about not risking anything for 'resources')? Whatever - I don't mind far-fetched plots when that is the pretext for the movie, but when they try to play it off as factual and believable, then all of this gibberish is irksome.Last but not least - the acting is uninspired and bland. Personally, I think Redford is overrated as an actor and Pitt has had better performances.
I could go on, but this movie doesn't warrant it. (I've already spent more effort on this comment than the writers, directors, producers, actors, et spent making the movie.) I rate it a 3/10.",Spy Game
210,avatar007,"Electrifyin', Shockin' & Rockin', but down to earth!!!!!!!!!!",10,13 March 2002,"***SPOILERS AHEAD***The story starts of with Tom Bishop (Aka Brad Pitt) holed up in a Chinese prison trying to recruit his ASSET Liz Hadley (played by enchanting newcomer, Christine McCormack, whose performance yet again is way above brilliant. Things go awry, the rescue attempt fails. It is 14 April 1991. Zoom in on The US Embassy in Hong Kong, and we find out the man at the pinnacle of Tom Bishop's life. This is the man who will haunt him forever. Zoom into Langley, HQ of the world's cleverest individuals, the Central Intelligence Agency. Nathan Muir, the rogue agent is asked to explain his actions in dealing with Bishop and this is how his narration goes:Bishop is a Staff Sergeant with the US Marines and is serving in Vietnam (around the time of April 1975), when he's approached by none other than the great Nathan Muir the CIA's most conniving, rogue agent. Muir deceives Bishop in a number of ways throughout the movie, in order to teach him how life as a spy really is. Throughout the movie the immense scenes of war torn Vietnam, Berlin & Beirut capture us. Along with the horrifying reality portrayed in the scenes accompanies a score second to none composed by Hans Zimmer's protégé, a young lad by the name of Harry Gregson-Williams (whose other credits include Shrek, Chicken Run, As Good As It Gets, Enemy Of The State, Replacement Killers, Peacemaker, The Fan, The Rock & Crimson Tide).
From the jungles of 'Nam we are transported to Berlin, East Germany in 1976. Bishop learns the hard fact of life as a spy, that in order for him to succeed, it will cost lives other than his own. Bishop is morally confronted and shaken when he leaves behind an East German he has to save from certain death, and he fails.Cut to Beirut, Lebanon in 1985. Bishop & Muir are again on the front lines of death and despair. This time they have to slay a well-known terrorist. In the process, Bishop falls in love with his ""ASSET"", the beautiful Liz Hadley (this is the pinnacle of the film where the story ultimately changes). Apart from a few misguided sex romps, Bishop finds out his ""ASSET"" is truly a fanatic from an extremist group based in London, and that she has been part of a bombing which has taken the life of the Chinese ambassador's nephew (something that was not expected!). What he doesn't know is that he's been played for a fool. Eventually he finds out Hadley is a scam artist, but still finds it hard to forgive her as well as Muir who exposes her during a regular chat over whisky in a sleazy Lebanese bar.Meanwhile back at Langley, As Nathan Muir narrates his hellish ordeal, he intends to take the CIA for a ride, and does it in a very clever unknowing manner which has the other members of the CIA guessing right till the end. Everyone in the agency knows Muir is about to retire, but nobody knows he has foreign assets worth $282,000.The twists of the film just get better and better with every passing second., and eventually Muir saves Bishop's life by putting his life savings on the line. He has taken the help of his trusty mate, Harry Duncan at the US Embassy in Hong Kong to corrupt 10 employees at Su Chou prison where Bishop was being held.What ensues is one of the best endings I've seen since ENEMY OF THE STATE (Another badass TONY SCOTT flick!).At Langley, Muir alters the thermal imaging maps of the Bahamas with China, and the CIA echelon quiz him about his property interests. Little do they know they've been conned.Muir in the meantime, figures out a very good way to save Bishop - he forges the CIA Director's signature and authorises a band of rag tag Marines to go to Su Chou prison to rescue Bishop and Hadley, who he is forced to think about since he delivered her to the Chinese government in exchange for a US official taken as a hostage. The rescue attempt takes place after a blackout occurs courtesy of the 10 employees of the prison who have gleefully been double-crossed by Muir.In the end though, Muir gets back his USD 282,000. And everyone realises its too late, the incident in China surprises the CIA. And Muir, Hadley and Bishop walk the earth.....free from their chains.The moral of the story is: ""WHO DARES, WINS"".My Final Verdict: The Movie:10/10; The Music (Score + Other Titles):10/10; Tony Scott (He always delivers!):10/10; Robert Redford:9/10; Christine McCormack:8/10; Brad Pitt:7/10.",Spy Game

Not sure from whence some reviewers (including reliable old Roger Ebert!) acquired the notion that this movie covers 25, 30, or 40 years: Muir meets Bishop some months before the final U.S. exodus from 'Nam (1975); Bishop leaves w/ that exodus. Present day is 1991: that's about 16 years.& Maybe we should take into account that people aged more quickly in 'Nam; whether covert or no. In any case, what's really far-fetched is Bishop as a sniper from 1965 thru 1975.There're also complaints about the superficial nature of the plot & the characters. Well, there's a superficial nature to clandestine ops.: you ingratiate yourself into the bosom of your opposing number, but unless you've developed suicidal ideations, you don't make friends w/ him. This is shown admirably in the case of the traitor Schmidt.The movie's style is a metaphor for the style of the people it portrays: if your job is declaring your brethren expendable, you are indeed shallow. Look @the task force: careers devoted to expediency won't soon extend serious consideration to morality.Muir may be smart, but he's superficial too: he views every phone call in terms of what it'll produce 6 rounds hence. All that's between him & Bishop is the new yuppie establishment: one suspects if the task force were composed of Troy Folger types, Muir wouldn't think twice about letting the Chinese have their way w/ Bishop. But you have to be cold & calculating to betray your superiors while standing in their midst.As an aside, it's genius casting when the protégé is played by a guy (Pitt) whose star quality is on par w/ where that of his mentor's (Redford) was 40 years ago. A further irony: Harry Duncan (""Harry's a friend!""

And, even worse, all told in cutaways and flashbacks, with an overdose of pointless helicopters, explosions and seen-it-all-before rip-offs of half decent war and spy movies.I suppose there could have been some tension building as to whether Pitt would get rescued - but there was none. It was obvious from about 5 minutes in that Pitt would be the subject of a rescue attempt, and the movie might have been watchable if we'd been unsure (or even cared) whether this would succeed - but hey!

I think they were trying to do something similar here, with all the intrigue taking place between a bunch of men sitting at a table. But they failed. Miserably. There is no intrigue, the plot is hackneyed and trite, the acting is stifled (and that's giving Redford the benefit of the doubt), the suspense is missing entirely. If you've seen virtually any movie released in the last, say, fifty years, then nothing in this movie will be a surprise to you. It's all been done before, and much much better.Oh, and if you saw the trailer and thought this was an action movie, then you will REALLY be disappointed.No matter what you were expecting, I would say, you're likely to be disappointed with this movie.

225,Khashayar Bavarsad,What if it was only spying for spying's sake ??,6,20 April 2003,"""Spy Game"" is an entertaining movie , one of the movies which engages your mind through the whole movie. Although 126 minutes is considered rather lengthy these days, it's not boring at all. That's what is naturally expected from the director Tony Scott.  But what is irritating in  ""Spy Game"" is that when you review the movie in your mind later - after all the exciting story is finished - you realize that after all it's an American hero who solve all the problems. Although the American patriotism is not as severe as Scott's older movies like Top Gun, but it still exists.  One may wonder why should such classy actors  - Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, .... - should accept such scripts.  The movie openly shows scenes of violence in China and Middle East.  How long will they continue using such villains - they remind you of ""Rambo"" - even in serious movies like this one.  The worst thing the movie shows about CIA is that they have some clandestine meetings and they sometimes prefer trade over people's life.  But who doesn't know that ?? What many Americans still don't know is that people of third world countries are not wild animals.  When some respectable artists play in a film like this, then it is no wonder why a cowboy like George Bush want to conquer all the world. The soundtrack including ""Brothers in Arms"" by Dire Straits and ""Rocky Mountain Way"" by Joe Walsh supports the energetic movie score.Photography and editing give some extra speed to the movie.Let's hope that someday even the action movies become indifferent whether people are American, British, Arab or Chinese.  A real spy game should be spying for spying's sake not for racial sake.  This movie tries to do that, but it is still not enough.I rate this movie 6 of 10 for being technically well-made.",Spy Game

228,weensy,A fine night's entertainment.,6,26 November 2001,"'Spy Game' is a fine night's entertainment, especially on the big screen. Although I did not find Brad Pitt's performance particularly distinctive, Redford was in top form. This film will keep you engaged throughout, allowing you to forget whatever is going on in your real life for a couple of riveting hours. However, as much as my friend & I liked the movie, we did find most of our post-viewing discussion consisted of picking out far-fetched and ill-conceived plot devices. The beauty of this film is that it is fast-paced and engaging enough that you don't notice these problems while you're watching it, only upon further reflection after leaving the theater. If you like Robert Redford, Brad Pitt, or the spy thriller genre in general, you won't be disappointed by this movie. However, if you're looking for a 'serious', thoughtful movie, look elsewhere.",Spy Game
229,exiledinnj,Needs a Deighton or leCarre,5,20 June 2008,"""Robert Redford plays George Smiley"" could have been the title for this film had it been given a better script. But with Redford in the lead, we know he has to be cool and superior to the dummies around him, and as soon as you read the cast list on the box of the DVD you know we are in for a happy ending, and one without the complexities that the two wonderful British spy novelist in my title give to their works.Brad Pitt, who seems to specialize in long, long films like this and Joe Black, is believable as the hot shot wonder-boy, but who's going to believe this hunk can be running around mid-eighties Beirut, looking no older than he did in 1975, and not draw attention. What he plays is ET, or Jeff Bridges' character from Starman....an alien who needs to be protected from the bad scientists at the CIA. Of course, they are not scientists but rather desk men protecting their fief, but the principle is the same.The old method was to put characters in cars and have them drive fast to keep an action plot moving; today directors ramp up the music, and use quick cuts to try to keep our interest. Sometimes this works; here it doesn't because every so often, the scriptwriters have to launch into a 'what's it all about, Alfie?' discussion between Redford and Pitt. In Martin Ritt's Spy from the Cold, the dirty business is not revealed until nearly the end, and with what heartbreaking force that revelation comes. Here Leamas and girlfriend survive....and like ET, get to go home.",Spy Game

233,werd75,My favorite movie . . .,8,21 October 2002,"Contains Spoilers!!! . . . well, at least currently my favorite movie.  My all time favorite would have to be Fight Club.  As you may have figured out, I'm a pretty big Brad Pitt fan, which is the main reason I saw this movie.Okay, we'll talk about the bad aspects first (there weren't many). Obviously this movie wasn't setting out to be the next James Bond or True Lies.  They were looking to portray a more accurate story of what spies do. I believe they succeeded at this on most levels, however, it still felt a bit like hollywood.  Also, Catherine McCormack was decent as the love interest, but not that great.  I don't really think she held up well opposite Pitt and Redford.Okay, the good aspects.  I thought that Pitt and Redford's performances were amazing!!!  I loved their characters.  Robert Redford was obviously one of the best spies that the CIA had.  Everything was by the book.  As far as he was concerned, if you deviate from the plan even a little bit, you run too great a risk of blowing the operation.  Perhaps my favorite scene was on the rooftop in Berlin after Brad Pitt had to leave one of his assets behind.Tom: ""Nathan, what happened, what went wrong?"" Nathan: ""Nothing."" Tom: Nothing? Nathan: Actually, one thing: don't ever question me again. Ever. Tom: What? Nathan: I give you an order you take it.  You don't ask why.  That ten seconds on the phone could have blown the op. Tom: The Op was bringing Schmidt across. Nathan: The op was setting up Ann Cathcart and your end had to look legit. Tom: What are you telling me, Schmidt was bait? Nathan: Yes. Tom: Nathan, they executed him on a sh***y Cellar floor!!!! Nathan: And it could have been you, and let me tell you something about Schmidt; he went to the Russians a week ago and said he had an American contact, someone he could use. Tom: Don't tell me that!  Don't f***ing tell me that!!  You didn't look into his eyes!!!  Don't tell me that!!!! Nathan: He was your asset, someone you use for information. Tom: Ahhh, Jesus Christ.  You don't just trade these people like they're baseball cards.  This is not a f***ing game. Nathan: Yes it is.  And this is no kids game either, this is a whole other type of game.  And it's serioius and it's dangerous and it's not one you wanna lose. Tom: Nathan, we killed this man.  We used him and we killed him. (Nathan says nothing) Tom: Okay, then you gotta help me understand this one, Nathan, what are we doing here?  And don't gimme some bullshit about the greater good. Nathan: That's exactly what it is.  Because unfortunately what we do is very necessary and if you're not willing to sacrifice scum like Schmidt for those who want nothing more than their freedom then you better take a long hard look at your chosen profession my friend because it doesn't get any easier. You wanna walk -- You wanna walk?  Walk. Tom: You shoulda told me about the op.  You used me. Nathan: I did and listen to this 'cuz this is important: if you were to pull some crazy stunt over there if you were to get nabbed I wouldn't come after you.  You go off the reservation: I will not come after you. (get's up and walks away) Tom: F**k your rules, Nathan. (looks back) Nathan: Okay.  But tonight they saved your life.You'll notice from that scene that Redford's character, Nathan, followed the rules so strictly and was so careful about not getting caught or anyone he was responsible for not getting caught, that he was willing to sacrifice one of their informant's life.  You'll notice at the end of the movie, however, that Nathan did rescue Tom from pulling ""some crazy stunt"".  This goes to show how much Nathan actually cared for Tom.Nathan also taught Bishop to ""put away some money so you can die some place warm.  Don't ever touch it.  Not for anyone.  If it comes to you or them: send flowers.""  Nathan had saved up $282 000 for his retirement that he spent without hesitation to get Tom out of the Chinese prison.Basically, Tom ended up changing Nathan.  The student teaching the teacher. Nathan wasn't following the rules so rigidly by the end of the movie.Whew, okay, I gotta go to class.  So I'm gonna write down my less inteligent thoughts really quick.  I thought that the blue and white jacket Brad Pitt had on during the scene where he was being trained was sweeeeeet.  I want it.  I thought the fact that the movie took place over sixteen years was convincing enough.  Pitt and Redford don't seem to get much older in real life either.  I guess Pitt was supposed to go from early twenties to late thirties and Redford from early forties to late fifties.  Convincing enough I thought.  Oh, and yes I'm aware that it's quite frightening that I knew that scene off by heart.  I've just watched the movie so many times.Anyway, I loved this movie.

Not the best of acting from Redford and Pitt (but seriously, what would you expect?) but they pull off enough chemistry to make this an excellent partnership. There is great drama, an intelligent storyline and a little bit of romance thrown in. I would recommend you buy (and not rent) this movie. Cos it just gets better with each viewing.

A great story about love, honor, principles and sacrifice compiled into a contemporary espionage thriller, a brilliant plot and battle of minds that continues up to the last minute of the film.It is about how people who work in the intelligence community think and operate and about the dilemmas they are faced with, when carrying out their job. The conflict between their aims and principles and how all these are affected by the relationships and loyalties that develop between them.Some concentration is needed to follow the plot and details; however, this what makes the film even more enjoyable no matter how many times you watch it.

240,ed_reed,"Watchable, if never pulsating, middle of the road spy thriller",6,21 October 2007,"A more or less by the numbers spy thriller. Saying that though by focusing the plot on Robert Redfords character (the older, wiser and soon to retire) 'old-school', desk bound CIA operative the film doesn't fall into the stereotypical action-cum-spy thriller with pyrotechnics every couple of minutes or rooms full of spy-geeks staring at screens showing the latest satellite 'intel' to cover plot ground.The film demonstrates that good old fashioned cunning and guile (plus knowing how the system works) is still enough to ensure that the right thing gets done. In this case the right thing is to try and ensure Brad Pitts character (the younger CIA field operative and Refords protégé) is freed from a Chinese prison instead of being left to the executioners in the name of political expediency from powerful people in suits high up in the US Administration and CIA.This is, in a nutshellm, the film - Redfords must spend his last day at work fighting against the system and senior 'men in suits' to try and get his errant protégé Pitt released from a foreign jail.Unfortunately the script and plots/sub-plots are never more than efficient, albeit fairly obvious. Brad Pitt hasn't too much to work with (and again he's efficient with what he has). The love interest in this film (and ultimately the reason Pitt's character ends up in the Chinese prison) is really quite weak - there's no on-screen chemistry and it stretches ones credulity a bit much for something so crucial to the story.All-in-all worth a view. In it's favour the film doesn't fall into the crash-bang-wallop category of other films in this genre, and therefore remains believable, and induces a little empathy for the characters. On the down side there's nothing new here from the actors or the story and it's quietness and averageness will probably ensure you've forgotten you've even seen this film after a couple of weeks.",Spy Game

All the little things Redford's character are supposedly doing to ""trick"" his fellow CIA people is really stupid, you really need to suspend belief to believe that people that stupid could join the CIA, for example the scene where he leaves his cigarettes in another room to distract someone so he can steal some satellite images and their are plenty of other things to complain about but I am sure others have and will say it better then me.",Spy Game

249,ace100,An imperfect movie,6,23 November 2004,"The movie has a very complex structure, with some flashback sequences that are very good but really do nothing to advance the plot of the movie. I ended up having to watch the movie again afterwards, skipping through the flashbacks to follow the plot more closely. Where the movie can spend twenty minutes on an incidental piece of background character history, important plot points are casually thrown out in single sentences. Perhaps the audience is expected to pick up these subtleties from the chaff - but I found it tiresome. There are other points which make the movie quite confusing. While its good to see British actors playing non-stereotyped roles in Hollywood movies, I was quite confused as to why so many CIA employees had London accents. In particular, at the beginning of the movie we see the very underrated actor David Hemmings talking in his Shakesperean British accent entering what is quite obviously LLoyd's of London; it took me sometime to understand that the character was an American in a building in Hong Kong. This strikes me as the equivalent of Clint Eastwood walking into the Empire State building pretending to be an Italian in Rome. Also, I couldn't understand why the movie was set in 1991 - why not make it present day? (Especially as no attempt was made to capture the period in fashion, technology etc). And its asking a bit much for us to believe that a military operation can be authorised simply by forging the signature of the DCI. The plot is thoughtful and interesting. However there needed to be much more character development and background (perhaps this rather than dwelling on the less-relevant set-piece flashbacks). For instance, it isn't immediately clear that Redford's character is trying to obstruct the CIA guys, and when it does become apparent, there is little explanation. This is especially odd as we are shown Redford in flashback as being a tow-the-line kind of agent, little more than professional respect for Pitt. I wish the movie had shown what made Redford want to take this course of action, why he felt the need to save Pitt. I really wanted to like this movie. In fact I think I would have preferred to read it as a Clancyesque novel. It has a very good premise, and there are outstanding performances by Redford and Pitt, while the supporting actors are all strong. The cinematography is also excellent, with innovative use of different framerate filming, angles, fast and slow motion, and some great use of locations. It seemed to me though, that this is prevented from being a polished movie by some rather amateurish errors in judgment.",Spy Game
250,soxRsupah,possibly the best American spy movie made,9,23 November 2005,"For me, the key to a great spy movie is an exploration of the moral ambiguity of spying. The BBC dramatizations of the John LeCarre / George Smiley novels are the epitome of this genre. Spy Game is about as close as an American movie has gotten. It's a little faster paced; a little more ""action adventure""; a little more high tech. But at its heart, it asks: why be a spy? is it worth it? Brad Pitt does fine. Robert Redford is wonderful. The aging ""pretty boy actor with talent"" as a mentor for the up and coming ""pretty boy actor with talent"" is an unavoidable subtext to the spy handling spy plot of the movie. And the pacing of Tony Scott's direction keeps the suspense alive throughout a layered script that explores personality as much as it moves the story along. Top notch all the way.",Spy Game
251,dogsmoke,Redford plays a great game of chess...,9,28 March 2005,"This film has a strong script, and a great narrative feel.As the perfectly cast Redford pits his wits against the CIA and other obstacles, you learn what drives him and the people around him, and the history that binds them. Each retrospective episode works as a mini film in itself, and there are some really surprising performances - notably the Doctor, who eventually gets involved in the war that Redford and Pitt are involved in. It is a tragic yet inevitable moment, and brings you into contact with all the peripheral casualties that a war includes.On the negative side, Tony Scott experiments with some glitzy and irritating camera techniques (v.fast pans, swoops, zooms), which add nothing to my mind. If it were a boring film, then maybe it would make it seem less so, but Spygame really doesn't need this.The music can also at times be embarrassingly corny. There is a Aled Jones type choir peace that accompanies one particular theme repeatedly, and simplifies the situation to a 'good v. evil' theme. When you are aware of all the numerous shades of grey in any situation like this (as shown in the film so well) this seems inappropriate.Conclusion: a great film, complex, great characterisation, all actors earn their money!

This movie had a slightly weird feeling from the beginning and I was expecting it to get better but unfortunately it didn't. I was bothered by the time span of the events of two decades with the actors looking exactly the same throughout the movie. Also the plot is sort of messy at times. Well, it's sort of simple actually. It's basically Redford's character reviewing the past events involving his protegé who is in trouble in a Chinese prison due to some tepid love story. Don't get me started on the implausible rescue mission. The movie has some merits too such as the cinematography and the street scenes. The plot however fails miserably. I wanted to like this and have liked low paced agent stories such as The Good Shepherd and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but this one does not rise even near them",Spy Game

It full of clichés and wrong superficialities like the noir like steam-smoke in Berlin (thats more like a gangster-film of the 30s in Chicago or New York), the non-aging Redford, the endless repeated Latin boy singing voice. Have you seen any emotions or development of Bishop? Has he ever said something he thought? Had he ever had an emotional outburst or any emotion that would be appropriate to the situation? Any reflections? Any characterization? Any real conflict? All the way morality did't play any matter, but at the end of the film? That seems sham. Any backgrounds, any pondering?? Everything seems designed only for the goal to have two heroes fighting against a system, which has not even tentatively questioned once; by none of them.Like Frank Lovece from TV-Guide wrote: ""Extremely well-shot espionage thriller that might have worked as an old-fashioned guy's-guy movie if the guys involved had any real, human personality and the espionage were actually thrilling.""",Spy Game
266,imdb-com-109,Better the n-th time around.,9,4 April 2006,"I made the mistake of only watching this film once the first time around. I did end up buying it, though I was never sure why. Then, years later, I got around to watching it again... and again... and again... While Spy Game is so fast-paced that it's difficult to keep up the first time around, I think that's what makes it such a great DVD.There are performances in this movie that defy description. You almost get a sense that if you were to meet him in the street, you'd get someone named Nathan Muir playing the part of Robert Redford - the transformation is that complete. In several scenes, but especially the scene on the Berlin rooftop, Redford gives a performance that is unlike almost anything I've ever seen in cinema. It's that perfect. Brad Pitt also does an amazing job, but Redford steals the whole movie.I had to re-watch Spy Game three times before I felt I got a complete understanding of everything going on. There is almost nothing given away for free in this movie - none of the standard Hollywood ""shove-it-in-your-face-so-you're-sure-to-get-it"" fare. Every decision, most plot points, and a lot of what would normally be called ""meaningful looks"" are written on Muir's face for a split second, then they're gone.This is one of the few movies that's intellectually challenging to watch. It takes patience and a quick assessment of each scene to understand and keep up. None of the acting is over the top or explicit; most everything is controlled, subtle, and delicately handled.All in all, Spy Game is an exceptional movie, IMO, to watch and in some ways to study.",Spy Game
267,lukabrasi,"Maybe a little far-fetched, but clever.",7,18 February 2005,"Spy Game will probably never be considered among the best spy movies to come out of Hollywood, however, it is a really entertaining movie with quite a few surprises.The movie is set in the early 1990's. Nathan Muir (Redford) is a retiring CIA officer who learns that his former protégé Tom Bishop (Pitt) has been captured while attempting a prison rescue in China and will be executed shortly. CIA brass want to know what motivated Bishop to attempt this unauthorized action and they interview Muir to find out. Muir tells the story of how he met and trained Bishop: from Vietnam to Berlin to Beirut. While Muir is setting the background, he is also working secretly behind the scenes to free Bishop. Will Muir's cloak and dagger antics be discovered before he has a chance to free Bishop? Overall the movie is not as good as other spy genre films such as Three Days of the Condor, Spy Who Came in From the Cold, or Hunt for Red October. I think Redford does well in the role of the retiring, slightly jaded CIA officer Muir. Pitt does well with what he's given, though I think his character suffers from poor writing, especially near the end of the film. Think of Spy Game as a more sophisticated Mission: Impossible (that's no knock on M:I) and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",Spy Game

I knew that the script writer wanna to set the coincidental maps between Bahamas shore and east China coast shore. but you'd better put the Amrican military base in Okinawa, Japan. there is no base in Penghu, Taiwan, and Okinawa is shorter flying to Shanghai. and they need to set the prison site at Tilanqiao prison in Shanghai, the Suzhou pirson is far inland of China, I do not think that the helicopters can fly over the Shanghai air-defense zone unless you cut all the power grid of eastern China rather than only Suzhou city.it's the year of 1991, why there are so many cultural revolution slogan on the prison wall. which had taken place in 60s-70s. do you think it's the graffiti wall in a bar. and the accent of those Chinese actor are cantonese ,not standard mandarin. it might be not easy to find a group of Chinese actors who from mainland China to speak the local accent or mandarin as I guess. I believe that there might be no one knows about it, to the western audiences and the movie crews, they are all the same. and those uniform of prison guards is big farce, the crew might not know the details too. I do not want elaborate more on this.The van used in the film in Suzhou prison, then used the same van in Beirut, Lebanon. I do not think you are short of budget, which then you can rent several helicopters to film. and the scence that all prisoners knock their rice bowl on the cell fence togehter, that only will happen in american movie, it doesn't look like China at all.Despite those weakness which I do not want list them all, I also want to say it's standard and good hollywood movies though, no big mistakes on other elements of the film. from this point of view, the only way can explain all this is that the u. s. film industry or amrican hoi polloi have little knowledge about China, even they want to work hard on it. so I also begin to doubt about American movie that depicts Middle East, Russia and Africa then, it's all your own imagary pictures of them.",Spy Game

From beginning to end this film keeps the viewer interested as Redford tries to play catch up with fellow CIA agents using every trick that he acquired during his time as a field agent.Brad Pitt plays his best role to date. He becomes the apprentice agent learning along the way but also showing that he will not be told what to do.Redford and Pitt combine perfectly in this one, it is an absolute pleasure to watch the two on screen together and one can only hope that will rejoin once again in the future.In addition, the supporting cast is superb.

It is not easy to follow, but I've seen it three times now and each time it gets better because the plot is so tight, and the performances are so realistic and intense. There is lots of witty dialogue, but it doesn't come off as trying too hard because it's all consistent with the way the characters are developed.I guess you either like Tony Scott's cinematic style or you don't. Unlike other favorites of mine he has done, like True Romance and Crimson Tide, this movie is told in a non-linear way - i.e. lots of flashbacks. But the thing this movie does that makes it so effective is keep a basic central story line - a CIA home office inquiry into a rogue operation - going, while around it, in flashbacks, we see the development of the two central characters in several sub-stories leading up to the present day situation. Sound confusing. Okay, it is. But for those who enjoy being challenged in movies like The Usual Suspect, it is very satisfying.So sit back, pay attention, and don't get discouraged.

I was glad to see a movie about the grey areas of spying and about the US' involvement via the CIA abroad in the 70's and 80's. What I like is that there are no clear lines, and unlike a Jerry Bruckheimer produced film, it wasn't bombarded with American flags and mindless patriotism. It was a very insightful look into the ways and means of two fictional spies (Robert Redford and Brad Pitt) to accomplish various missions over a 15 year period, dealing with both politics of the agency and emotional ties with ""assets."" I really like how they showed that spying isn't as James Bond as most people think. Simple things like a piece of gum can be the difference between life and death, and tools like cigarettes are much more effective than carrying a gun. Although some of the scenes of terrorism were very graphic and horrific, I think it is important that we see what is really behind these terrible common occurrences in other countries. If Top Gun is what you are looking for in a war movie, don't see Spy Game, because it is a very different and much better look at goes down because the CIA finds it in its best interest.9/10",Spy Game

I liked that fact that the heroes were not always very heroic.  They were very human, experiencing moments of doubt, conflict and weakness.  I haven't completed my C.I.A. operative training yet, but I think most of the tactics and stragies employed by the main characters are probably true to life.  I rated this movie as a 9 out of 10.

I have recommended this film to everyone I know, and haven't received a bad response yet. I have always been huge fans of Redford and Pitt, they're acting abilities being top-notch. When i heard they were doing a movie together, i was so excited. The expertise of Redford's character(Nathan Muir) is really fun to watch. The deadpan deliveries by Redford are wonderful. Pitt has once again outdone himself to bring another great performance to this picture. Bottom line, great story, great action, great acting!",Spy Game
305,peterjakobsen,Topnotch spythriller,8,9 July 2002,"Robert Redford and Brad Pitt both deliver a great performance in this very exciting spy thriller. Although you seem to miss a motive for Redfords actions late in the film, the movie still delivers an exciting insight in what could be the inner workings of a secret service. Worth to watch.",Spy Game
306,LN-ArT,Fantastic,9,20 September 2002,"This is one great espionage movie. Very realistic, fantastic screenplay, great plot... Superb filming... it has it all! And one of the best things: it's not another american propaganda movie. It shows the bad things of the CIA etc etcin one word: GREAT MOVIE!",Spy Game
307,dc880601,Why there isn't one single American movie that shows the world a real china??,5,29 August 2009,"Why there isn't one single American movie that shows the world a real china?? As a Chinese, every time my country was on the Hollywood's big screen, I would have a really hard time recognizing it. The same thing happens in this spy movie. It's very funny that the 1991's china looks no different from the China in 1941 - poor old-fashioned clothes, corrupt officials who like to watch bikini-clad women, prison with almost no guard.... I think there is a gap between the real china and the china in Americans' imaginations, which is expanded by Hollywood movies like Spy Game and many other movies. In Mission Impossible 3, the local Chinese people still wear Chinese tunic suit which only appeared 30 years ago in Chinese history. I don't know if other countries' images have also been wrenched. However, I sincerely hope that Hollywood filmmakers could do more research before they show American people what other countries are like. In this way, not only can we enjoy a fascinating story but also learn more about the fact. Isn't that good for everyone?",Spy Game
308,bbenson311,Boring & Not What I Expected,4,10 April 2010,"I was pretty disappointed with buying this movie. Boring for the most part.The description on the back sounds better than what really happens. Most of the movie is about Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) talking about Tom Bishop (Brad Pit) in their past, to other members of the CIA he works with.Tom is captured in a Cheese prison while trying to save a woman he used to love. His ex boss Nathan tries to figure out how to get him out before Tom's execution in 24 hours.How the rescue of Tom turns out seems too easy. The way it happened seemed too quick and didn't have anyone after them. It doesn't show what happens when the Cheese realize Tom is gone.Had the movie not been mostly flashbacks of the past and been about people trying to get Tom out in a rescue mission, I would have enjoyed it.None of the people Nathan discussed his past with Tom to didn't do anything to help him. It helped explain Tom's job and the relationship with Nathan, but other than that, it is pointless.",Spy Game
309,perl_phreak,Possibly the best intrigue/espionage movie ever made,10,17 June 2009,"That's quite a statement to make, I know, but this movie is a rare gem in an ever-more-diluted genre. Redford delivers an incredible performance as the jaded veteran CIA case worker who tells the tale of his protégé: Tom Bishop. Redford is too slick for words, and only he could deliver the lines as believably.Spy movies tend to be flashy and sexy--either James Bond or Jason Bourne--and for good reason: they put butts in seats. Don't get me wrong, I love those movies too. But they very rarely give an honest portrayal of the real world of espionage and intrigue. Understandably, because most of that world is incredibly dry and boring.Spy Game shows this reality. Admittedly it sticks to the highlights to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat--it's intense--but it also shows the human cost of espionage, for the agents and for those they affect.At its core, Spy Game is about dedication, sacrifice, and redemption, seen through the lens of realpolitik at the end of the Cold War.",Spy Game
310,joakimhelm-1,what a great of movie,10,20 July 2005,"i just saw this movie and i really flew out of my seat i didn't know that Brad Pitt could act, and not just show his face on the screen and save the box office.I really like Bob Redford here too he is really good as an old time working CIA man.The directions of T.Scott was OK and the story that takes us through the Vietnam var too the end of the Cold war was belivible. I like the whole production of the movie and give if two thumbs up and my small toeJoakim Helm",Spy Game
311,andreas-kolodziejak,The film shows that solidarity between men keeps them alive,10,31 August 2005,"Robert Redbord and Brad Pitt at their best: It is a wonderful film on friendship and the price that has to be paid to stick to it e.g. by going with all available means against persons in an organization that only worry about their careers and would sell not only their colleagues but even their mothers for it. Friendship keeps people alive, literally and metaphorically speaking. Friendship in the first place between Muir (Redford) and Pitt (Bishop), but also between Pitt and his girlfriend in the prison and between Muir and his secretary and other persons that help him in rescuing Bishop from the prison in China. At the beginning of the film one would think Muir is like James Bond but Muir becomes more of a character. It turns out that he is not only a professional in intelligence work and in educating new agents but what is nicest: Muir has a heart of gold.He helps Bishop even though their relationship deteriorated due to the problems with Bishop's girlfriend.",Spy Game
312,tz247,excellent film,10,17 December 2005,"Top notch thriller. Engrossing, though typical plot/subplot (two men develop friendship, woman comes between them, but buddy helps out and saves couple) and great character development considering characters are supposed to be mysterious spies and very little is told about their background.Robert Redford is a cynical, yet warm mentor, and Brad Pitt is a hotshot moralist as well as being the best assassin in the ""business"". Redford is an old-school operative who uses his 'tradecraft' to out-wit the technology the modern CIA now relies on, to bust his protégée out of a Chinese prison after Pitt's character, a rogue agent, uses CIA resources to rescue his girlfriend, fails and ends up in prison himself facing execution in less then 24 hours for being a spy . The relationship between the two men is told in a series of flashbacks that span a time-line of about 20 years starting during the Vietnam war to the cold war in Berlin and the mean streets of Beruit as Redford's character stalls for time during a debriefing into the rescue failure on his last day of work before retirement. In the meantime, between breaks of debriefing, he mines for information about why the CIA won't save one of their own as well as setting up a covert operation to get Pitt and his girlfriend out of prison before they are executed.Cinematography is reminiscent of brother Ridley (grainy, washed-out imagery in tones of brown and blue), and editing and camera movement is more like recent films from Woo or Ang Lee. The action is realistic without being over the top. There are no fancy gadgets or impossible stunts.Compared to stuff like XXX (or worse, XXX-2), Mission Impossible 1 & 2, or any number of action thrillers about secret agents (such as the most recent crop of James Bond films or Charlie's Angels), this movie seems to tell it the way it is or the way you might think reality might be. The ""tradecraft"" actually makes way more sense then, say, a watch with a laser cutter built in or a car with missiles an ejection seat. All in all, a very watchable and believable film.",Spy Game
313,homework_seattle,insensitive and uncaring,9,28 June 2015,"I read the NY Times and Ebert reviews, back when both had a pulse. Both chide Scott and the characters in Spy Game with ""not caring"" or being insensitive. This they find incongruent with the movie. ""if they don't care why should we,"" Roger wrote. Pitt wrestles with ""caring"" throughout the movie however. The CIA suits, including Redford, certainly do not, but this is the kernel of the plot - Redford's path and Redford's choices. To me the unsympathetic visuals and pace are a perfect backdrop for the main character. In a dispassionate ""music video"" of solemn faces and flashy cuts, that seemingly ran before and after the arcs of these two agents, the machine does not change. It does not care.",Spy Game
314,pquadra,Robert and Brad needs to do a Part 2,9,16 April 2016,"This movie needs a Part 2. Its great story line and delivery are awesome to watch. Keeps you in your toes most of the time. Exciting and action suspense.This movie would compete with Jason Bourn, James Bond and other action movies.The part that Brad Pitt heard the code line when he got rescued he thought that Robert have abandoned him for good.There is always a backroom transaction and will never know who ordered it, how it was executed and delivered.This would be a BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE it ever Part 2 would be created.",Spy Game
