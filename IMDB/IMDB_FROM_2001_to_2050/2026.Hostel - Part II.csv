0,Leofwine_draca,A sequel that feels tired and repetitive compared to the first,4,1 August 2016,"I absolutely adored the first HOSTEL film so when I heard about the sequel coming out, I knew I had to go and see it at the cinema. Sadly, HOSTEL: PART II is an essentially lacklustre follow up, a film that for the majority of the running time simply reprises the characters, locations, and storyline from the first film without adding much in the way of new stuff to the brew. The twist here is that the protagonists are all females, but sadly the central casting leaves something to be desired. Jay Hernandez, who played the hero, Paxton, in the first movie returns here for a short appearance – and I hate what they did with his character, considering how great he was in the original – and his performance reminds you just how sympathetic a character he was.There aren't really any sympathetic characters here. Of the three main girls, two are stereotypes, with Bijou Phillips acting abominably as the bimbo type. Meanwhile, Heather Matarazzo is a stock nerdy girl, all big teeth and speaking intellectually, and her character quickly grates. Matarazzo goes way over the top and is only really convincing in her inevitable torture sequence. The final girl of the three is also the heroine, as played by Lauren German. German is very attractive but her character is far too tough and never really feels to be in much danger.Here, director Eli Roth decides to blow the lid off the whole kidnap-and-torture plot, showing us how the business works through a plot strand which follows two American businessman from their initial bidding over their mobile phones to their turns as torturers. I was in two minds about this. The idea of following the torturers rather than the tortured allows for some fresh material, and certainly these two guys breathe some life into the production; it helps that both Roger Bart and Richard Burgi are very good actors here. But much of the suspense in the original film was derived from the mystery surrounding the shady goings-on and, of course, there's none of that here. Instead it's all very clinical and many scenes are played for a laugh, which lessens the impact of the horror, although there is one very good twist involving these guys.At the end of the day this is a graphic horror film that revolves around the torture sequences. Here, they're bigger and gorier than before, mixing plenty of dark humour into the brew to keep things moving along (watch for the circular saw scene if you don't believe me). The first is undoubtedly the worst and hardest to watch, a lengthy bloodbath involving a scythe and sickle, in which a Countess Bathory-type character bathes in the blood of her victim. The torture scenes at the film's climax are pretty much lacking in excitement, especially the events surrounding Lauren German's character that are obvious in the extreme. Roth goes out of his way to target the sensitivities of his male viewers with one particular gore effect, but the result is laughable – with the inclusion of the dog – rather than wince-inducing, as the 'eye' scene was in the first. What's missing is the whole adrenaline-pumping climax that we had at the end of HOSTEL; the escape and subsequent punishment of the various baddies. Here, due to a plot twist, we get none of that, just an abrupt ending with black comedy that disappoints. Aside from one particular sequence involving Matarazzo's character, nudity is kept to a minimum this time around.Roth can't resist throwing in plenty of in-jokes and appearances from old actors into the film. Watch out for Quentin Tarantino's head on a stick, a couple of girls from the first film appearing in a photo, and other minor recurring characters. There are also roles for Edwige Fenech, screaming heroine of many a '70s giallo flick, who still looks lovely to this day; '70s Italian action star Luc Merenda, greatly aged and pretty much unrecognisable, and finally Ruggero Deodato, director of the notorious CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, who cameos in one of the film's funniest scenes as – yep, you guessed it – a cannibal, eating Stanislav Ianevski, better known as Victor Krum in HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE. Despite these fun references, HOSTEL: PART II already feels like the series has had it's time, coming across as both tired and repetitive, a real disappointment considering the freshness and power of the first film. Let's pray they don't make a third...",Hostel - Part II
1,SnoopyStyle,love the blood bath but not much else,5,23 June 2015,"Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is haunted by his experiences and is hiding out with his girlfriend. However the organization tracks him down and beheads him. In Rome, heiress Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips) and depressed Lorna (Heather Matarazzo) are enticed by nude model Axelle (Vera Jordanova) to go to Slovakia. Rich American friends Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart) win the auction to kill Beth and Lorna.The rule of the horror sequel is to go bigger and more extreme. I don't think it achieves that in most respect. This time they're going with girls which does up the stakes in terms of horror. I'm always surprised by the use of guys in the original. I really like the literal blood bath. I think it's imaginative and wonderfully staged.What I don't like is getting to know the killers. They are rather bland individuals. They are not compelling although they're played by two good character actors. It's not a good way for the sequel to go bigger. The only way it would work is if Eli Roth could write some amazing dialog like Tarantino. Sadly, he's not a dialog man. After the blood bath, the movie becomes boring. The other effect of focusing more on the killer is that the girls get less time. I don't really care about these girls after awhile.There's also an over-use of the Bubble Gum Gang. The movie keeps trying to be funny. It's not campy enough to be funny in that way. It doesn't have good enough jokes to be funny in any other way. If I didn't like the blood bath so much, I might have rank this even lower.",Hostel - Part II
2,claudio_carvalho,Sadistic Sequel with a Great Twist,7,20 February 2008,"In Rome, the wealthy Beth (Lauren German) and her college friends Whitney (Bijou Phillips) and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo) decide to travel to Prague to spend a couple of spare days. In the train, they meet the model Axelle (Vera Jordanova) after an incident with rude natives of Prague and their acquaintance convinces them to take a detour to the beautiful Slovakia and lodge in a hostel. While partying in the village, they are lured and offered in an international auction to sadistic members of the Elite Hunting under a contract that does not allow leaving the torture chamber in a hidden facility alive.""Hostel  Part II"" is a good sequel of ""Hostel"", disclosing the fate of backpacker Paxton that escaped alive from the facility in Bratislava, Slovakia, of the first movie and then following the tragic tour of three American friends. The story is quite similar to the first one, except the great twist in the last five minutes with the action and revenge of the clever and rich Beth. This violent and gore movie is recommended only for fans of the genre, and those that liked the first ""Hostel"" will certainly appreciate this sequel. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Albergue  Parte 2"" (""The Hostel  Part 2"")",Hostel - Part II
3,nogodnomasters,FOUR SEASONS IS FOR OLD PEOPLE,6,23 July 2018,"For some reason this movie picks up where the last one leaves off. Then all of a sudden we have all new characters, as if the first movie didn't matter. In the first feature we had a slow build up to the torture scene with plenty of gratuitous nudity. We actually got to know the characters and didn't know exactly what was going to happen. In part 2, we know what is going to happen and who is going to get it and we also know everyone is in on it.Edwige Fenech as the art class teacher was a classic addition. She is infamous for her European school teacher movies. The movie has a twist, but that really doesn't help it. It certainly doesn't nearly live up to the first feature.F-bomb, nudity (Vera Jordanova, Heather Matarazzo,)",Hostel - Part II
4,kosmasp,Changing views,4,13 June 2014,"It does give you a different perspective and goes beyond and behind the curtain, if you want to call it that. There are a few jokes that just don't sit well (one of the most offensive, even if it's a real ""game"" amongst women, that has something to do with rape is fortunately cut, but can be seen as deleted scene) and the overall story does not feel as driven and neat as the first movie did.Especially the ending that on the one hand kind of is a call back to the first movie (though not the same mind you), but does seem to do something ""money"" wise that is not the way it should have gone, proves to be very distracting. There is obviously torture and there is character ""left-overs"" from part 1 that are taken into this one, to tie it into it, but all that it does is remind you, how good part 1 was. A few good ideas do not make a good sequel",Hostel - Part II
5,gavin6942,A More Mature Follow-Up to the Disappointing Original,7,5 April 2008,"In ""Hostel"", a group of young men end up at a hostel in Slovakia that kidnaps people for its clients to torture and kill. Now, a group of American girls ends up at the same hostel. Will they meet the same fate, or perhaps they'll have more luck? And what ever became of the kids from the first film? Full disclosure: I didn't like ""Hostel"" very much. I loved ""Cabin Fever"", but grew weary of Eli Roth after his second feature. So ""Hostel 2"" sat unreviewed for several month before I finally broke down and watched it. Guess what? We have a sequel that eclipses the original in every way -- this one is pretty amazing. Relying far less on torture and excessive nudity (although both are present here), we get an actual plot, likable characters and best of all a glimpse into the other side.Torture clients aren't just faceless monsters in ""Hostel 2"", but real people with hopes, dreams and fears. There is a depth and complexity to them that allows us to almost sympathize with their angle, no matter how reprehensible they may be. (Some of them are still just ruthless killers, of course.) At one point, a potential murderer raises a philosophical point posed in the past by Hobbes, Rousseau and Locke: without laws, how is man naturally going to respond to others in a state of nature? To some degree, they attempt to answer this question. (""Battle Royale"" also addressed this, though the characters in that film were in a more forced and less natural environment.) Focusing on a female cast rather than male one really helps, I think. Let's assume the audience (mostly male) wants to see beautiful women, which I think is a safe assumption. In the first film, to accomplish this the boys had to come across numerous loose women with no character development. Visually appealing, sure -- but no substance. By having a female cast, the male audience gets to watch the young ladies the majority of the time while also developing a plot and character motivations. Nudity is less prevalent (but still present). Roth is fully capable of telling a story, as this movie shows, and I'm glad he chooses this over the shock value of sex and torture.The cast is interesting. Rick Hoffman, who was ""The American client"" in the first film, returns as ""the American businessman"". He is something of an anti-hero. While we ought to be against him (he's after the protagonists), the film gives us the point of view that he's just being human, no matter how awful he comes across. Another great cameo is Ruggero Deodato, the maestro of Italian cannibal films (""Last Cannibal World"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust""). He appears, appropriately, as the Italian cannibal. His scene was not initially in the script (Roth showed up on Deodato's set personally to invite him to Prague) but I think it really clinches the deal of providing us a film that is both new and also giving homage to the classic.Although you have to see ""Hostel"" to fully understand ""Hostel 2"", I think the punishment is worth the reward. For everything the first film lacked, the second makes up for it and then some. Romance, comedy, torture... a truly well-rounded horror film, which is a growing rarity in this age of shock cinema. Highly recommended.",Hostel - Part II
6,jboothmillard,Hostel: Part II,5,31 July 2021,"The first film was an okay ""torture porn"" or ""gorno"" shocker, a sequel was almost inevitable, but I was hoping for something better, seeing slightly more positive reviews from critics, from returning director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever). Basically, following his experiences in Slovakia, surviving college student Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is suffering from PTSD and lives in seclusion with his girlfriend Stephanie (Jordan Ladd). Stephanie denounces Paxton's paranoia as exaggerated. The following morning, she finds his headless corpse in their kitchen. An unmarked box containing Paxton's severed head is delivered to Elite Hunting boss Sasha Rassimov (Milan Knazko). In Rome, Italy, three American art students, Beth Salinger (Lauren German), Whitney Swerling (Bijou Phillips), and Lorna Weisenfreund (Heather Matarazzo), are convinced by Axelle (Vera Jordanova), a nude model they are sketching, to join her on a luxurious spa vacation in Slovakia. The four of them check into a hostel, where the desk clerk surreptitiously uploads their passport photos to an auction website. American businessman Todd (Richard Burgi) and his best friend Stuart (Roger Bart) win the bids on Whitney and Beth. Later that night, at a harvest festival, Lorna discovers Beth has inherited a vast fortune from her mother. Stuart and Todd are in Slovakia and attend the festival. Stuart approaches Beth and the two share a friendly but also strange conversation. Meanwhile, Lorna is invited by local man Roman (Roman Janecka) on a boat ride, and Lorna is kidnapped by him. Unaware of this, Axelle volunteers to wait for Lorna and Beth, while Whitney leaves the festival. Lorna wakes up naked and hung upside down above a bathtub. A woman (Monika Malacova) enters the room, disrobes, and lies in the bath below, and proceeds to slash Lorna with a scythe, the blood pouring onto the woman's naked body, before slashing Lorna's throat. Meanwhile, Beth, Whitney, Axelle, and local man Miroslav (Stanislav Ianevski) head to a spa to relax. Beth dozes off and wakes up alone and finds herself pursued by several men in the woods. She is ambushed by a gang of violent gypsy street children but is saved by Sasha and Axelle. Later at Sasha's remote mansion, Beth is confronted by Todd and Stuart and realises that the men are associated with Sasha and Axelle. Looking for a hiding place, she discovers a room filled with human trophy heads on spikes, Paxton's is one of them. Beth is captured and taken to an abandoned factory and tied up in a room. Beth is soon joined by Stuart, who is supposed to kill her, wealthy Todd paid for her for Stuart. But Stuart has seconds thoughts, he unties Beth and explains the situation. Beth goes to the door to try to leave, but someone knocks her out. In another room, Todd terrorises Whitney with a power saw but loses his nerve after accidentally cutting her without killing her. Horrified, Todd tries to leave, but is informed that he must kill Whitney to leave. After Todd refuses, the guards unleash several dogs, which maul him to death. Meanwhile, Stuart has completely changed his mind and turned psychotic, he is now intent on torturing and killing Beth. He reveals that Beth has an extremely close resemblance to Stuart's wife, whom Stuart hates but cannot kill, and he begins to torture Beth. With Todd now dead, the Elite Hunting Club offer the maimed Whitney to the other clients to kill, including an old Italian (Ruggero Deodato) who is eating Miroslav alive. Stuart shows Beth the pictures of the maimed Whitney to frighten her, after discovering Todd's death, then accepts the offer, leaves Beth, and beheads Whitney. When Stuart returns, Beth seduces him into untying her from the chair. Stuart attempts to rape her, but she fights him off and chains him to the chair. Beth offers to buy her freedom with part of her inheritance when Sasha and the guards arrive. Though Stuart tries to outbid her, Sasha knows he cannot afford to do so. Sasha tells her to leave she must also kill someone. When Stuart insults Beth, she cuts off his genitals, leaving him to bleed to death. Satisfied, Sasha tattoos Beth, making her an official member of the Elite Hunting. That night, Axelle is lured by the street children into the woods, where Beth ambushes and beheads her. Shortly after, the children start playing soccer with Axelle's severed head. This sequel has an improved story and characters you actually care about, the gore is much more frequent, highlights include the naked woman bathing in blood, cannibalism, severed heads and body parts hacked all over the place, and it is darkly funny and more atmospheric than the original film, predictable at times but a satisfactory horror. Worth watching!",Hostel - Part II
7,Woodyanders,So-so sequel,5,20 April 2016,"Three female American college students find themselves the unwitting targets of a Slovakian hostel that's the front for an evil business in which decadent and depraved wealthy people pay top dollar for the privilege of torturing and murdering innocent folks who are specifically abducted to serve as fodder for the clients.Writer/director Eli Roth's sequel to his savagely effective original alas not only gets bogged down in both hackneyed horror tropes like an opening which turns out to be just a bad dream and a grindingly predictable narrative trajectory complete with a final girl who's clearly signposted for survival from the get-go, but also further suffers from a crippling dearth of much-needed tension and creepy atmosphere. Fortunately, the subplot about corrupt and eager businessman Todd (a chilling portrayal by Richard Burgi) and his wimpy reluctant buddy Stuart (a likable performance by Roger Bart) doesn't pan out exactly as one might initially expect it to. Moreover, Lauren Graham as spunky rich girl Beth, Bijou Phillips as the snarky Whitney, and especially Heather Matarazzo as the hopelessly gawky'n'geeky Lorna make for appealing damsels in distress. The fact that such familiar Italian horror cinema veterans as Luc Merenda, Ruggero Deodata (wittily cast as a cannibal), and the ever-luscious Edwige Fenech pop up in colorful cameos helps a good deal. However, the moments of dark humor fall flat (for example, a bunch of little kids play soccer with a freshly severed head) and the bulk of the gore gags fail to make any substantial impact, although the blood bath set piece does prove to be quite startling and disturbing. Okay at best, but the first one was far more edgy and unsettling.",Hostel - Part II
8,ma-cortes,Creepy gore feast with three girls trapped in a bloody spiral of violence,5,16 March 2009,"This creepy picture produced by Quentin Tarantino concerns on three tourists(Lauren German,Heather Matarazzo,Bjou Phillips) and a fourth(Vera Jordanova)touring in a hostel from Bratislava(Slovakia). The story revolves around the three travelers, but they're bidding victims for two bidders(Richard Burgi,Roger Bart) in their current target for dismemberment and tortures.This second part takes accent as gore with victims graphically mutilated as bloody entertainment. The grisly killings are experienced vicariously by the audience by means of flood in guts, blood, gore as an other movies of this kind.The tale packs tense sequences of hair-raising horror and lots of gore and guts , courtesy of make-up craftsmen, Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero. Juvenile casting formed by beautiful girls: German,Phillips,Jerdanova and initial appearance by Jay Hernandez, first part's starring. Special intervention by Edwige Fenech, a known Italian star from the 70s and Ruggero Deodato(Cannibal Holocaust) as the Italian cannibal. Suspenseful, frightening soundtrack by Nathan Barr and adequate, sinister cinematography by cameraman Milas Chadima. The flick is eerily directed by Eli Roth(Cabin fever). Because the murders are very gruesome , most viewers will be as disgusted as they're feared. Squeamish spectators will must to cover their eyes during a pair of particular horrific scenes and have vomit bags close at hand , though horror fans should be amused. If you thought 'Hostel I'was too violent , this one will redefine the word for you.",Hostel - Part II
9,BA_Harrison,More of the same from Mr. Roth.,5,9 July 2007,"Like his chum Tarantino, Eli Roth is an exploitation fan-boy who cannibalises the cult cinema he loves in order to produce his own movies. But unlike Quentin, who at least has the brilliant (and largely original) Pulp Fiction in his resumé, Roth has no such masterpiece under his belt.And Hostel 2 does nothing to change that fact.In Hostel, his 2005 hit, Roth presented a truly terrifying concepta group of backpackers become victims to rich sadists, who are willing to pay for the thrill of killingand promised a milestone of horror cinema that would disgust, terrify and shock his audience. What he delivered was undeniably gory, but, with a poorly devised script that centred on sex and sadism, it wasn't very scary.This sequel simply retreads the story of the first film, only, this time around, the backpackers in peril are female, there is (surprisingly) hardly any T&A, and the whole thing is even less frightening.Roth unwisely decides to show us more of the people behind the death-for-sale enterprisethe Bloodhound Organisationand allows us to get to know a few of its patrons, including the crazy Mrs. Bathory, who likes to bathe in the blood of her victims, and a couple of rich businessmen 'newbies' who are keen to learn the ropes. By giving so much away, the director does a 'Mrs. Bathory' on his own franchise: he wallows in the bloodletting, but simultaneously bleeds the film dry of fear.Gorehounds, however, will no doubt revel in its particularly brutal (and messy) scenes of visceral horror and, although I have so far found Roth's work to be fairly disappointing, I can only admire him for the inclusion of a very nasty moment of genital mutilationsomething you don't often see at your local multiplex, and proof that, if anything, the guy has balls (even if some of his unfortunate characters don't by the end of the film!).",Hostel - Part II
10,paul_haakonsen,"But why veer down that path, Eli Roth? Why?...",5,18 June 2018,"It was quite nice to find that this was actually a direct continuation of the first ""Hostel"" movie.But then again Eli Roth veers fast from that and returns to the formula that was used in the first movie. Which actually leads me to think that this movie was essentially just a re-make of the first movie just with a female cast ensemble instead. And with other torture scenes, of course, but otherwise it was essentially the same. And that felt like a cold dead fish to the face at the hands of director Eli Roth.""Hostel: Part II"" is fairly entertaining and somewhat visceral if you haven't seen the first movie. And if not, then you will certainly be entertained by part II. However, if you have already seen part I, then there is not much for you to enjoy in part II. With part I already seen, then you simply just switch to autopilot and cruise through this without any stimulus.I will say that the cast in ""Hostel: Part II"" were certainly doing adequate jobs with their given roles and characters. And again, if you haven't seen part I, this becomes all the more enjoyable.While there certainly were some gory and gruesome torture scenes in ""Hostel: Part II"" then it hardly made up for what it was lacking in originality. And that ultimately lead to this being little more than a mediocre re-make of the first movie.",Hostel - Part II
11,Quinoa1984,Eli Roth's latest exploitation film probably does just as much damage to the sensibilities of the audience as the girls in the torture rooms,1,19 June 2007,"What does it say when an exploitation flick is bad because of it's writing? I know that it's not something that a viewer should try and look for as something credible to its success. But Roth, who wants more than anything with Cabin Fever and his Hostel movies to be one of the greats, provides one of the most obvious scripts I've ever had the unfortunate experience to sit through be produced. It's not just that the three main characters, this time women cause it's so different to have them have the exact same personas as their first film male counterparts (though it is part of it), it's not just that Roth tries to up the emotional ante by giving us ""characterization"" with two brothers (or friends, this is never made clear) who win a bidding on one of the girls, only when the time comes that one of the characters goes between vulnerable nice guy to true sadist in an eye-flash, or that Roth uses all of the bad horror movie clichés to every effect that it can. Actually, it's more than just a combination of this. If Roth were more self-conscious by now about his approach, and extended it further into black comedy as opposed to Grand Guignol, he might be on to something else.It's that he thinks he's making a ""good"" movie, as he's said in interviews, and tries to get past how unequivocally obvious everything is- there's not one genuine surprise as far as character or suspense in the ""story"" goes, let alone a scare, with maybe one guffaw towards the last scene with the soccer game not really earning a laugh- by shooting it as if he's attempting to make great art. Emulating his Italian horror idols, there are many wide compositions of characters walking through the torture building, the masked figures going by during the outside dance scenes, the metaphor of those little kid bastards running around from the first film that are given more ""dimension"" this time, and the hot springs meant to evoke danger in the fog. But any kind of craftsmanship (and if I did have to go completely objectively here, this is not horribly directed, which goes without saying he'd still get flack from a student film club) is obfuscated by how Roth exploits any kind of sympathy for the characters from the audience. After all, who cares about developing a character, or even having much of a semblance of one to give a damn about, when we're leading up to Heather Mattazzaro getting her black sliced by a sword while hanging upside down to feed the fetish of a naked woman lying underneath? And there's even a good actor, Roger Bart, who gets swept up in this piece of dung. Bart, who formerly played a role in the Producers on stage, is supposedly given the character with the most dimension, but in the end becomes just another offensive pawn in Roth's crap-shoot arsenal. And any bits of dark wit that came with the original Hostel, and truth be told there were a few, are left out for plot contrivances coming left and right. It's actually irresponsible, I think, for Roth as someone dealing with exploitation film-making to not make such geek-show material more interesting, considering who his Exec producer is, Tarantino. Did *he* even read the script before okaying it? As a director, maybe Roth could someday put his somewhat competent chomps to something that doesn't shout out ""exercise"" over an actual story. But for now, Hostel: Part II can be marked as one of the most misogynistic, typically dumb, and ultimately depressing movie-going experiences in many a moon.",Hostel - Part II
12,Coventry,Lousy sequel or superior product?,7,28 October 2007,"The most positive comment I can state about ""Hostel: Part II"" is that it actually is a lot LESS dumb and exploitative as it initially looks. On the surface this movie appears to be like a hugely irritating textbook example of a horror sequel: quickly written and released to cash in on the unexpected success of the original as much as possible, more gore, more shocking, sicker deaths and victims from the opposite sex because they can scream much louder. Admittedly it looks like a cheap effort that isn't worth seeing but I can assure you Eli Roth knew very well what he was doing and on several levels part two actually is a vast improvement over the original. First of all, and this is a mainly an interesting treat for experienced horror fanatics, this sequel is literally stuffed with tributes to vintage horror cinema and references towards factual gruesome history. Endless praise and respect to Eli Roth for casting unlikely deities of the glorious Italian horror industry, like Luc Merenda (""Torso"", ""Kidnap Syndicate""), Giallo-queen Edwige Fenech (who still looks extremely yummy despite being nearly 60 years of age) and even Ruggero Deodato, director of the notoriously controversial Italian cannibal movies, as  a cannibal! The nasty and sickening torture sequences are also a lot more meaningful, like the literal bloodbath massacre which is a downright sublime and fairly accurate enactment of the legendary East-European countess Erzebet Bathory. Secondly, the script of this sequel IS more intelligent as that of the original, as the story investigates and unravels the whole organization behind the booming torturous tourism. It's still highly implausible, of course, and Eli Roth insists on convincing the audiences that every inhabitant of the European continent is a sadistic & psychopathic individual, but at least the plot is more coherent and informative this time around. Apart from focusing on the three female American students, who will become subjected to inhumanly cruel torturing ordeals, there are sub plot revolving on the big boss behind everything (who clearly doesn't allow the original survivor Paxton to escape) and far more extended portraits of the 'clients', from the moment they start bidding on the offered girls up until they're inside the factory chambers dressed like executioners. Say what you want about the nastiness and shamelessness of ""Hostel: Part two"", but it's undeniably also a well-structured and compelling film. The more insightful look into the Slovakian student-torture network naturally serves to compensate the totally vanished element of surprise of the original. Suffice to say the fate of the three girls is very predictable, it's only a matter of when exactly they'll end up in the factory and just how painful it will be for them. Eli Roth even attempted (rather successfully, I may add) to insert a couple of surprising and unexpected twists when approaching the film's climax. The girls' acting performances are overall adequate (particularly Lauren German impresses as lead-heroine Beth), the set-pieces are macabre but nearly not as plentiful as in the first and  needless to say  most of the torturous footage is nauseating and definitely not intended for people with a weak stomach. To all the others: Bon Appetit!",Hostel - Part II
13,michaelRokeefe,The franchise may end here.,3,4 November 2007,"What in the hell happened? Does writer/director Eli Roth deserve the blame? Don't actually know, but what a disappointment compared to the first gore fest. Even the characters; you don't really care less what terrible and horrific thing is in store for them. Three American college girls are studying in Rome; Beth(Lauren German), Whitney(Bijou Phillips) and Lorna(Heather Matarazzo)get the chance to take a little weekend trip with one of their art class models Axelle(Vera Jordanova). They have no idea that they are being lured to a Slovakian hostel, where their planned little piece of paradise turns into Hades. The three become victims in a sick world where the filthy rich can satisfy their grisly fantasies; nothing off limits whether it be sexual perversion, torture or slice and dice. Yes, there is the sadistic images and graphic violence you would expect. You don't expect a movie that is not too far away from being lame.",Hostel - Part II
14,Hey_Sweden,Nostrovia!,8,6 October 2012,"Writer / director Eli Roth follows up his grim and gory horror pic ""Hostel"" with this even more outrageous sequel, which does a great job at slowly building up to typically intense, grisly torture scenes that make the wait worth it.After an opening in which we get to find out the fate of previous survivor Paxton (Jay Hernandez), we're introduced to three college girls, studying abroad, who are very much your standard issue horror movie characters, as what they're most interested in, really, is having a good time. They get wind of an idyllic sounding hot springs resort in Slovakia, only to end up becoming more victims of the international torture-and-kill-for-pleasure business, which we get to see in action, as the information on potential victims is gathered and sent to clients worldwide who bid on the chance to do some serious damage. Among the clients are jerk American Todd (Richard Burgi) and his meeker brother Stuart (Roger Bart), and among the gals are Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips), and the sweet Lorna (Heather Matarazzo).What this viewer feels that Roth doesn't get enough credit for is building up the tension and establishing character on his way to delivering all of the money shots. He milks the locations and the locals for all the atmosphere that they can provide. There's more than just torture going on in these films; if they really were just wall to wall sadism, it would ultimately be numbing.But the violent scenes in ""Hostel Part II"" prove to one up those in the original in terms of depravity. The Elisabeth Bathory inspired scene is particularly effective. And the finale, despite a seemingly sudden shift in attitude from one of the characters, is more intriguing than one might expect.And Roth is able to temper things somewhat with a gleefully dark humour, such as the impromptu game of ""soccer"" that breaks out at the end. The victims, commendably, are not unsympathetic, although it's worth noting that the girl whom viewers may like the most gets it the worst, showing Roth's willingness to throw certain expectations out the window. He also creates some vivid and frightening scenes that have nothing to do with gore, such as Beth suddenly finding herself alone at the hot springs, or the sequence (one that some viewers could understandably not be able to stomach) involving a thug with a gun and a gang of children. The look that production designer Robb Wilson King and cinematographer Milan Chadima give other scenes is appropriately grimy.The cast gets an A for effort, with Barts' casting coming off as rather interesting. Cameos by Giallo superstar Edwige Fenech, actor Luc Merenda (""Torso""), and ""Cannibal Holocaust"" director Ruggero Deodato make this especially fun for genre buffs.It hardly needs saying, of course, that this material is not for all tastes but it's fairly potent stuff for people favouring the dark, the moody, and the savage.Eight out of 10.",Hostel - Part II
15,preppy-3,An improvement over Part 1--but that's not saying much,3,22 June 2007,"The movie starts off with the Jay Hernandez character from ""Hostel"" documenting what happened in the first movie. Then we cut to four friends (Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo, Bijou Phillips and Vera Jordanova) traveling to Prague. There they go to the very same hostel as the first...and are ""sold"" to the highest bidder. It also concentrates on two bidders--Todd (Richard Burgi) who can't wait to torture and Stuart (Roger Bart) who's unsure.OK--I HATED ""Hostel"". I found it sick, stupid, insulting, homophobic, badly directed and chock full of unpleasant characters. This is a step up...but writer/director Eli Roth couldn't have gotten any worse. You don't hate all the characters in this one--some of them are actually sympathetic. They're given no personality at all but you can't have everything I guess. This movie isn't as stupid or insulting as the first. It takes a full 45 minutes before any gore is shown to develop a story. It's also well-directed by Roth which was a surprise--it used multiple screens very inventively. Still this is no great movie.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! There isn't a lot of gore here--but what is here is STRONG and more than a little sick. Matarazzo's character is strung upside down nude and sliced away at while a nude woman below her writhes in ecstasy as she's covered with her blood. A man's best parts are cut off (in closeup!) and thrown to a dog who eats it up. Heads are cut off, children are killed (for no good reason that I could see), buzz saws are used on faces...this movie really piles it on. Usually I'm against cutting violence in a movie to get an R rating...but HOW did this get by with it? Really, this goes far beyond the bounds of good taste. The last time I saw a man castrated and having it eaten was ""Caligulia"" which had an X rating! Seriously what exactly has to be shown now to get an NC-17? SPOILERS END!!!!!The acting is all good across the board and the movie did throw in a few twists at the end that I didn't see coming. So the movie did horrify me but it also sickened me and just went too far. I walked out of the theatre absolutely stunned and disgusted. I can only give this a 3. It's better than Part 1 but it's still not worth seeing. But I do have to admit that Roth is improving.",Hostel - Part II
16,poolandrews,Good sequel.,7,11 April 2008,"Hostel: Part II starts as three young American students Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bjou Phillips) & Lorna (Heather Matarazzo) on their way to Prague are talked into stopping off at Slovakia by Axelle (Vera Jordanova), there they check into a hostel at which point their details go out & the bidding can start with the winner able to kill the girl of their choice. Beth, Whitney & Lorna's detour quickly becomes a nightmare as they are kidnapped, taken to an abandoned factory & left to be tortured & killed by whoever has paid the most...Written, produced & directed by Eli Roth this was the sequel to his surprise hit Hostel (2005) which I consider a mighty fine horror film, while I can't say Hostel: Part II was any better than the original Hostel I can't say it's any worse either. The script gives the audience pretty much more of the same with it's storyline revolving around American tourists being kidnapped in Slovakia & being sold to the highest bidder for them to kill & torture. The main differences are that instead of three blokes it's three women this time & we actually find out much more about the clients who do the torturing & killing. No matter how twisted their logic is it does sort of make sense, Hostel: Part II tries to give reasons & motives to it's character's & spends a fair amount of time exploring & developing them. I am sure there will be all the haters out there who criticise because it's unrealistic, well the whole film is fiction so it's not meant to be realistic & how on Earth do they know the motive someone might have for killing another person? Murderers exists, right? They have to have a motive no matter how sick or baffling it may sound. I actually though Hostel: Part II does a very good job at fleshing out it's character's both good & evil. The ending was unexpected too & a departure from the original, instead of using guile to escape Beth uses her head & I really liked how she turned at the end as well which I believe most of us would. As human beings we have very strong survival instinct & squeamishness quickly goes out of the window if it's a stark choice between either life & death. The film really only kicks into gear at around the one hour mark but once it does there's some pretty juicy sadistic scenes of gore, torture, humiliation & abuse. It did it for me.Director Roth does a good job & the film looks very good with high production values. The sequences inside the torture rooms with benches of rusty tools & surgical implement's laid out by all manner of power tools really is quite unsettling & gives one a sense of real unease as your mind wonders what might be coming. There's a few gory moments but overall I wouldn't say it's wall to wall gore, there's a headless body, some decapitated heads, a woman is hung upside down & her back is sliced open before her throat is graphically slashed, part of a woman's scalp is torn off, a mangled & mutilated body is seen on a few occasions, a man is seen strapped to a table with all the skin on his leg sliced off, someone is decapitated & their head used as a football in a misjudged comedy moment & there's a fairly painful look castration that most blokes will cross their legs at when seen. I wouldn't say Hostel: Part II is scary but there are lots of tension & a foreboding atmosphere.With a supposed budget of about $10,000,000 Hostel: Part II is well made with glossy production values, all too convincing special effects with no CGI in sight & nice photography. Apparently shot in the Czech Republic, Iceland, Monaco & Slovakia. The acting is pretty good, Lauren German as Beth in particular impresses. Cult Italian exploitation filmmaker Ruggero Deodato makes a small fun cameo appearance as a cannibal & if you don't know who Deodato is then tough.Hostel: Part II is a good, gory & entertaining horror film with one or two really stand out sadistic torture scene moments. It's not a huge departure from the original Hostel but it is different enough to warrant a look & those new to the Hostel series should know that you don't have to have seen the original Hostel to get it.",Hostel - Part II
17,dbborroughs,Letter to Eli Roth why Hostel 2 fails as a film and at the box office,3,11 November 2008,"(A response to the directors complaints about poor reviews and poor box office due to ""pirating"" when this was released to theaters) Dear Eli- I saw your film Hostel 2 and I thought I'd take the time out to let you know my feelings about the film and my thoughts as to why the film has done poorly at the box office..I went into the film with some trepidation since previously you've made some good little horror films. However as the opening sequence too shape it was clear that any ability you've shown in your previous outings has gone by the wayside. It was clear that the big screen director has become a by the numbers made for video hack.What were you thinking? What is this another women in peril film? Come on I've seen this before dozens of times its nothing new. even your twist ending has been done better elsewhere.Eli baby, honey, you don't flirt with cliché you jump in bed with wild abandon in an orgiastic frenzy that makes me wonder if you took your pants off before doing so. Clearly you have no patience since everything on the screen is pretty much telegraphed-especially if you've seen enough of these type of movies. To be certain you've made some nice images but you've made a film thats trying to be something other than what it is and so has become absolutely nothing.You've made what is at best an okay film, but its neither something I'm happy I paid to see (I'm feeling a bit ripped off and raped in my wallet) nor is it something I will ever bother with again. Let me differentiate here-I don't want to see Hostel because its a sick movie- Hostel 2 is a no second viewing because its time I can never get back in my life.Your movie isn't making money because it isn't very good. I'm sure that misogynistic men will love the film, hell I'm sure that people will cheer and groan about their privates for years, and I'm sure the ending will become a punchline down the line, but you've made one of those movies that has a couple of moments and zippo else.Its a non-entity. Its neither good enough to enjoy nor bad enough to roast, its just a poor little film thats a time suck in the worst possible way. Clearly the only way you can prevent it from sinking like a stone tied to your career is to scream its not your fault that its tanking at the box office. You have to blame others. Well if you have to blame other blame the stupid people who gave you the cash to make this film. You should be honest and stand up and realize that the film thats in theaters is your film and no one else's. You also have to understand that some of the raves from places like Ain't it Cool were meaningless back pats among friends so no matter how good it felt it was just a friend making you feel good and nothing of value.Eli- forgive me for picking on you, had you said nothing about pirates stealing your opening (against a blockbuster that contains a huge chunk of your core audience) I would have let it go as a maybe two star or four out of ten misstep that wasn't as good as went before, but you can't accept failure on your own terms so I have to put you straight- or like a dog thats pooped on the carpet I have to poke your nose in it (even if its not that big a deal) so you can learn to take defeat gracefully. I mean look at Uwe Boll, a supreme hackmeister but at least he keeps going and takes it all in stride. To be honest after your little outburst I respect Boll more than I respect you-even if your movies are better.Sorry Eli, our movie failed because of you and not for any other reason.Sincerely DB",Hostel - Part II
18,lastliberal,Lousy sequel,6,30 April 2008,"This was a real letdown from the first film. It deserved it's Razzie nominations for Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie, and Worst Prequel or Sequel. I have not seen the two films that beat this for the awards, and I plan to avoid them.There was just too much talk and setup and very little action at the end. They had the formula right in the first one, and I cannot understand why they changed it for this one. There was very little titillation, and almost no horror.I hope they are through as they have certainly lost their way. What was Roth thinking?",Hostel - Part II
19,zardoz-13,Sequel Surpasses the Original!,9,3 January 2009,"After arousing widespread notoriety in 2005 with ""Hostel,"" horror movie helmer Eli Roth has struck back with a sensationally unsavory but superior sequel, ""Hostel: Part II,"" that skewers the rule that follow-up films rarely never overshadow their predecessors. Not only does Roth wrap up the loose ends from ""Hostel,"" but he also takes cinematic terror to the next level. Gorehounds who figured that Roth of ""Cabin Fever"" fame couldn't top the blood, gore, and torture that made ""Hostel"" a mind-warping melodramatic exercise in mayhem should fortify themselves for shocks, scares and surprises galore. ""Hostel: Part II"" makes both the ""Saw"" trilogy and ""High Tension"" look tame by comparison. ""Hostel"" confined itself strictly to amoral businessmen who paid profligate sums for the pleasure of slicing and dicing abducted male backpackers on holiday in post-Soviet Eastern Europe. While the original focused on male victims, ""Hostel: Part II"" serves up equal opportunity sadism as wealthy men and women carve up kidnapped twentysomething damsels in distress. Indeed, specific scenes in ""Hostel: Part II"" create such intensity that you have to wonder what prompted the usually conservative Motion Picture Association of America to amend its usual standards and grant Roth's ghoulish film an R-rating when it clearly deserved an NC-17 for its full-frontal male nudity. Anti-violence advocates who complain that Hollywood horror movies are getting out of hand will find a lot to raise a stink about with ""Hostel: Part II."" ""Hostel: Part II"" picks up the plot where ""Hostel"" left off. Paxton (Jay Hernandez of ""Friday Night Lights"") manages to escape from an anonymous Slovakian city where his two pals and he were seduced with promises of promiscuous sex but then were drugged and taken captive in a death factory where maniacs carved them up like roast beef and left them for dead. As ""Hostel: Part II"" unfolds, Paxton makes it back to America and takes refuge in the middle of nowhere with his ex-girlfriend. The nightmares, however, are far from over for poor Paxton. The scene then shifts to Rome, Italy, where three American college students are sketching nude portraits of men and women. Beth (Lauren German of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake), Lorna (Heather Matarazzo of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"") and Whitney (Bijou Phillips of ""Bully"") form the ill-fated female threesome in ""Hostel: Part II."" Beth qualifies as the Paxton of this trio, but she learns from her mistakes a lot faster than Paxton. After the girls have gotten on the train to Prague, they run into one of the sexy foreign models that posed for them in Rome, Axelle (Finnish actress Vera Jordanova), graciously acts as their tour guide. Actually, Axelle secretly leads them like lambs to the slaughter. Meanwhile, in a strategy straight out of NBC-TV's ""Law & Order"" franchise, writer & director Roth provides elaborate background information about the well-heeled slime that run the death factory. These evildoers have created what amounts to an international syndicate along the lines of a terrorist organization. Once an individualman or woman--hooks up with this odious outfit, they are sworn to secrecy and must sport a bloodhound tattoo. If they harbor second thoughts about these sadistic shenanigans, the organization will track them down and terminate them with extreme prejudice. Two clean-cut American businessmen have already made bids on the Internet in competition with others from around the globe for the opportunity to torture Beth and Whitney, and they have to submit to the tattoo process as an indoctrination of sorts. Todd (Richard Burgi of ""Cellular"") and Stuart (Roger Bart of ABC-TV's ""Desperate Housewives"") act like big game hunters would on a safari in Africa. Todd drools over the prospect of torturing a helpless girl, while Stuart has second thoughts about this ordeal .Whereas ""Hostel"" featured stereotypical, one-dimensional characters, ""Hostel: Part II"" boasts characters that are far more interesting, even if they are just as vulnerable. Writer & director Eli Roth leaves precious little to the imagination once the torture begins. He stages several gruesome scenes that will make even the most hardcore horror fanatic cringe and cross their knees. One ghastly scene shows a murderess in a pool using a scythe to draw blood from a bound and gagged babe suspended above her from the ceiling so that she can wallow orgastically in her victim's blood. While ""Hostel"" was fairly straightforward, ""Hostel: Part II"" offers more twists and turns that will catch most audiences off guard, especially the surprise ending. Aside from the gender shifting protagonists, ""Hostel: Part II"" relies for the most part on the original formula that combined elements of the classic chiller ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1932), the Jean Claude Van Damme thriller ""Hard Target"" (1993), and an Asian urban legend that Roth said he discovered on the Internet about people who could pay to torture willing victims. Roth isn't above poking fun at himself. When the mastermind of the death factory strolls into his trophy room of severed heads, a replica of Roth's head is on display. Cult European horror movie maestro Ruggero Deodato, who helmed stomach-churning cult classics such as ""Jungle Holocaust"" (1977) and ""Cannibal Holocaust""(1980), appears briefly as an Italian cannibal dining on a sliver of flesh from a man's thigh. Unlike other summer film releases that drag on for two hours or more in length, ""Hostel: Part II"" clocks in at a lean, mean 93 minutes without a moment wasted from fade-in to fade-out.",Hostel - Part II
20,grantss,Decent plot ruined by excessive goriness,4,11 October 2014,"Decent plot ruined by excessive goriness. Hostel II starts quite well: good background set up, decent plot. There was even some semblance of character depth and development. The three girls were quite likable and relatable.However, having seen Hostel, you know where the movie is going. It does take a while to get there, which is good, as it builds the tension and makes you think you are in for something substantial. This is all in vain, however, as once the blood starts flowing it is a matter of Eli Roth trying to out-gore any previous gore-movies. Heaps of gratuitous blood and gore, trying to gross the audience out. The plot becomes quite silly and implausible. But I guess most people aren't watching this for the plot...",Hostel - Part II

Sadistic sequel to the gorefest splatter retro hashed by filmmaker Eli Roth lathers on the brio of buckets of blood over substance in this sick, twisted and disdainable chapter, this time with a sex change: three American young women are the unsuspecting victims-to-be to the depraved rich and powerful torture club in Slovakia. While German (a dead-ringer for Justine Bateman) acquits herself the film on the whole feels rushed and even sloppy (on all counts, pun intended).

With the first film at least it gives some insight into the reality of being caught up in such a crime activity in a foreign country. Lauren German, Bijou Phillips and Heather Matarazzo play the lucky victims who find themselves hung upside down, chained to torture chairs, and subjected to an array of punishment that should have warranted this garbage an X rating. Director Eli Roth is talented but fails to employ his craft to something worthy of it. When he made the first film, he demonstrated a degrading underground nightmare but here the script is just a repeat aiming for stomach turning reactions. German receives the opportunity to sever someone's penis. Phillips is grazed badly with a chainsaw. Matarazzo awakens hung upside down where her blood will become bath water. Roger Bart is the one interesting character who seems not to understand what he has bought himself into when purchasing one of the girls. He is joined with Richard Burgi who bought two of the girls in an auction. Presented as a sequel to please numbing gore hounds who see this pointless mayhem as entertainment.

23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Barely better sequel to a rather decent original,6,26 October 2016,"Agreeing to travel to Slovakia, a group of friends find themselves disappearing one-by-one around their spa getaway and eventually realize they've been targeted by a deadly criminal organization that's torturing others like them and must find a way to stop them to get away alive.This was a massively disappointing effort. One of the film's main flaws is that much like the original there's way too much time spent away from its actual destination in the titular torture room, and as a result it's pacing is just way too problematic in the first half. It's opening is really troubling which scores this no points at all for what happens there, and once they get on track with the remaining part of the film it's at least another twenty minutes before they even get wind of the idea of going to the country, there's a big search through the city to find the place and takes another half-hour after that before any sort of on-screen torture occurs, leaving it's torture scenes, which are the main body of the film, until almost an hour in. That's way too long for the film to get to it's big spot, and it's beginning is just boring and really hard to sit through. The last real flaw to this one is the fact that there's just no idea behind how anything works in here. There's no knowledge about how the torture group runs business, despite the subplot about the one guy offering to bring the new guy in, but even still, that's just about getting him in, not how it works. From the choice of targets to the way it's spread out among those who are interested to the daily grind, the inner-workings of the hostel itself are complete blanks and nothing at all is explained or given. There is some good stuff in this one, though, which again like the original comes from the blood and gore. This one is much bloodier than the original, with the kills in here being quite brutal and truly inventive here in several graphic scenes that are just chilling in their execution and professional in their lay-out as the manner of brutality not only taken upon by the clients against them as well as their inevitable revenge. That's not to count out the centerpiece kill, where a nude female victim is strung up over a bathtub, the killer gets in and then proceeds to slice up the body with a hand-scythe, which then proceeds to rain torrents of blood down upon the victim in an extended and incredibly graphic sequence that, alone, is better than anything in the original for it's mixture of blood, gore, over-the- top disgust and sleaze, and serves as the highpoint in the film. Also quite fun is the rather well-done forest chase in here, which is creepy, suspenseful and action- packed, making it quite fun to notice the chances of getting away and the overall effect they have. The last plus, though, is the rather colorful and entertaining ritualistic ceremony they attend, which adds a little bit of levity into the film and isn't all-out torturous to get through. In the end, though, this simply ends up feeling like just a remake of the original with the males turned into women but very little change otherwise.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, several Sex Scenes and drug use.",Hostel - Part II
24,The_Void,"Not a lot of plot, but there's a bucket load of GORE!",8,3 July 2007,"Well, I wasn't over enthused when I heard that Hostel was getting a sequel. It's not that I didn't like the original; I just didn't really feel it needed a sequel. However, I was on board with the idea as soon as I found out that Edwige Fenech was going to be in it, and while her appearance is short and very sweet (she's still smoking hot at 58!), her casting alone shows that Eli Roth knows his stuff better than a lot of modern day horror directors do. Indeed, this film clearly takes more than a little bit of influence from the great exploitation classics of yesteryear, and when you throw in some twisted humour and a no holds barred attitude towards violence and gore - you've got one of the best films of its type in years! The basic plot of this film is pretty much the same as the first film, except this time we focus on three young girls rather than three men. They are lured to Slovakia by a sexy European lass and end up staying in the same hostel as the boys did in the first film. However, this time the plot is given a new spin as we also follow two of the rich Americans that pay to torture and kill young people harvested from the hostel...One of the main things I loved about the original - and love about this film - is the European atmosphere. This gives the Hostel film an advantage over other American movies as most of them are set in America, and this one therefore is a little bit different. The locations used are really quite good; we get some the morbid and depressing atmosphere inside the torture house, and then some picturesque shots of Slovakia. The two offset each other well. Of course, the main reason many will see this is for the gore - and Hostel: Part II doesn't disappoint in that department! There are a trio of truly nasty scenes, involving blood bathing, cannibalism and castration respectively! In true horror style, Roth has also done a good job with casting the leading roles, although strangely there is hardly any - if any - sex in the film at all. The most shocking thing about this film isn't the gore, however, it's the nihilistic tone - the idea of rich men and women paying to butcher other human beings is completely sick and Roth carries it off well. Overall, this film won't do much for the discerning film viewer; but if you like your exploitation flicks and are partial to a bit of gore; you can't go wrong with Hostel 2! (horror fans will also want to keep an eye out for Ruggero Deodato in an amusing role, and fellow Italian and cop flick favourite Luc Merenda)",Hostel - Part II
25,trashgang,more gore,6,25 June 2009,"It's difficult to overrule your original movie but Roth did it. The story is still the same as the first part but here we are following three girls. What makes it more creepier is the fact that they are, well, girls. When you see boys been tortured it doesn't offend you because boys go to the army. But girls, well, that's also the most complaints that this flick had in the papers, not girl friendly. But that was what happened in the era of the slashers too. If you don't like it, don't watch it. Is it watchable, yes it is. When you think that the maddest guy is the weirdest one well you will be surprised. There is a lot of blah blah in the movie and it take a while before things happen, there isn't much gore in it, you don't really see the suffering and torturing but when the red stuff flows, it flows in gory fashion. Watch the 'Bathory' scene, extremely well done by Nicotero. It could have been better if there was more blood in it in the second part. That would have given the movie a seven or eight, but for the gorehounds, watch it and of course, Roth usually uses a lot of babes in their nudies...",Hostel - Part II

There is a plot twist as we see who's the real bad guy in the film. Character development of the weaker guy is usually the jerk theory. Our protagonist must out think and hustle and un likeable jerk, in a sick over the top ending. The sick humor at the end is memorable. Acted and directed better then the first installment, but still a greasy exploitation flick. 4 stars.",Hostel - Part II
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Hostel Part II,5,9 August 2007,"Between the first Hostel released last year and its sequel, there have been countless number of torture porn movies released, like Turistas, Captivity, Wolf Creek, and the likes, so much so that audiences these days (or fans of the genre) bay for more blood to be spilled, the gorier the merrier. In that respect, Hostel Part 2 failed to live up to its predecessor's success in sticking to the blood, gore, violence, drug and nudity clauses that have become staple, and instead, opted for a perceived balance with its earlier film, which made it turn out to be a yawn.Like Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2, Hostel and Hostel 2 are different beasts altogether. The first hostel was a horny excuse told from the male perspective, where a group of buddies go backpacking in Europe in search for ultimate pleasure, only to get sucked into something they had not bargained for. Hostel 2 starts off where the first had left, before we're introduced to a newer group of backpackers, this time from the opposite sex. Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips) and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo) are three (eye candy) girls who find their way to the same Hostel thanks to a nude model Axelle (Vera Jordanova), and before you know it, you've come to watch what you've expected.Except that things start to shift into high gear only about an hour into the movie. Prior to this, writer-director Eli Roth decided to show the audience the perspective of the other side - the lives of the customers in the form of Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart) and their run up before savoring their game, and dwelled a little more on the business aspects of the hostel. What was briefly suggested and shown in the first movie, gets the in-depth treatment that frankly, those who're here to watch blood and gore, couldn't care less about.Whatever's left in the blood, gore, nudity department gets quite toned down, unlike its predecessor, so despite the similarities in structure, there is less gratuity in those aspects. It becomes a study of sorts of those who have too much money and not know what to do with it, of wanting to do something unique, and getting that ""respect"" and killer aura. It really took its time before getting into the groove, and to my surprise, it had quite a satisfying feel in its ultimate revenge and how that played out. It also included some fleeting commentary on how the dangerous, perverted ones are almost always the quiet ones, and those whose bark is loud, chances are their bite is nowhere close.Hostel Part 2 flopped at the US box office, and it's understandable why. Great eye candy doesn't cut it, and recycling a similar structure, with zero enigmatic villains (especially businessmen), doesn't help the cause. The death sequences aren't really innovative (I know I sound sick when I say that), and by not delivering what audiences have come to expect, I guess Hostel should just stick to 2, being bookends of each other, and nothing else.",Hostel - Part II
28,HumanoidOfFlesh,More amusing than the original.,8,27 June 2007,"The survivor from the ""Hostel"" Paxton is quickly decapitated and the film follows three young and supple female art students heading for a relaxing weekend at a Slovakian spa.And where better to stay than an inexpensive hostel?Of course the three girls are finally abducted and taken to the torture house.Roth introduces the other side of the torture business as we follow two friends who have paid to maim and kill.In my opinion ""Hostel 2"" is actually tamer than the original.There is some nasty gore on display including throat slashing via scythe and castration(an obvious nod to Joel M.Reed's exploitation classic ""Bloodsucking Freaks""),but Roth does show some restraint here,even cutting away to make one demise occur off camera.The film is also more funny and amusing than the first one.Overall,it's a pretty decent follow-up,so give it a look.8 out of 10.",Hostel - Part II
29,StevePulaski,Lacks the bare basics for a good horror film,1,8 January 2012,"Hostel: Part II is an ugly horror movie lacking not only everything vital for a good film in the genre, but all the acceptable instances in the original Hostel. It is remote of any entertainment suggested from the title, and feels almost like watching a snuff film rather than a horror film.Clearly, Roth's intentions were to make not a better horror film, but a stronger one. One that would shock and disturb the people who saw the original Hostel even more. I guess you can say he succeeds in that. He however fails in creating atmosphere, scares, suspense, and entertainment. I guess you can say he succeeds in the simplest field possible.I do, however, credit Roth for at least somewhat reviving the horror genre. Hostel was released in 2005, where horror was starting to drift into a sea of mediocrity in its content and its rating. Many films were a mild PG-13 and the remake wave was about to hit Hollywood strong the following year. Roth reminds us that the PG-13 rating can only sometimes successfully hold a horror movie. To be truly effective, you need an R rating.The story is directly lifted from the first film, only this time, it's three young females as the lead characters. They attend an art school in Italy and are wealthy Beth (German), tomboyish Whitney (Phillips), and oddball Lorna (Matarazzo). The three women are convinced to attend a heavenly spa by the nude model they are sketching one day, and soon enough, they're on a train heading straight for Slovakia.If you've seen the original Hostel (if you haven't, why are you reading a review of the sequel?) you know where this is going. If you are a common horror fan you know where this is going. If you know the vaguest of plot points you'll know where this is going. Hostel: Part II lacks imagination and surprise among other things.The pacing is off. So much so that you can't even begin to become the least bit frightened. And the atmosphere is just as hokey as the original film. The gruesome scenes of mutilation and dismemberment could almost label the film as a misogynistic snuff project disguised as a mainstream horror film.The characters are also barely definable in their personalities. In Hostel, they were moderately developed but not to be compared to by anything or held on a pedestal. By the end of the film I didn't know a ton about them, but I at least wanted to see one of them succeed. The women here are as vacant and as absent minded as, say, a horror remake. Their characteristics bland, their personalities moot, and their appearances young and exuberant.Hostel: Part II is a brutal exercise in torture porn. It's more grisly and mean-spirited than the previous film, and offers no efficient or bold ending to top off its mundane qualities. Due to the critical and financial failure of the film, I can see all future sequels going straight to DVD. I believe sending it to even the SyFy network at this point would result in some sort of an improvement.NOTE: The MPAA can also pat themselves on the back awarding Hostel: Part II an R rating. Between the original film, its sequel, and Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, it clearly shows the MPAA won't award a film an NC-17 rating for violence and disturbing content alone.Starring: Lauren German, Roger Bart, Heather Matarazzo, Bijou Phillips, and Richard Burgi. Directed by: Eli Roth.",Hostel - Part II
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Actually, I thought it rocked!",8,8 June 2007,"OK, I know people are just going to hate my review after seeing that title, I have a feeling people are going to give this movie a harsh rating just because it is a sequel to Hostel. I know there are not that many fans to the first film, I understand somewhat, it's not for the faint of heart and the first half is like a soft core porno, not to mention the blood and gore that's involved. But I think somewhere down the line it will be a classic cult film. Now for the sequel, I thought, despite a few flaws here and there, I thought it was just as good, maybe even BETTER than the first. Not the most shocking ending I've ever seen either, but it was a good one.Well, the tables have turned, now we have 3 American girls who are the target of this blood hound club's addiction to torture and death. Two brothers are in this together, one isn't quite sure if he could do it, one is psyched out. One of the girls is a bit naive, one is a total slut, and one is the calm and collected one. But when they are taken by the same people as in the first film falling into the same trap, they soon realize the massive trouble they're in. But I think one of the girls has heard the term ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" a little too much when she realizes what she's in for.There are some massive gory scenes, a warning in advance. I thought that they kinda took an idea, if you ever heard this woman from history, they called her ""Countess Blood"", I believe, look her up if you do not know what I'm talking about, because there is a scene that is very much like that in Hostel 2. I would only recommend this for fans of the first Hostel, or if you have an open mind, it's not for the faint of heart. It's very gory and very disturbing, but it's a great horror flick with a great ending! 8/10",Hostel - Part II
31,blanbrn,A film that takes hostage torture and exploitation to new heights.,9,9 June 2007,"Just finished watching this film and I must say I found it both highly entertaining and disturbing. It really shows torture in a gory and blood soaked way and it can make a viewer explore their darkest fantasies and fears, and it really shows that true evil does exist and things like this could happen. You have the setting in Slovakia with three college students from America are aboard to enjoy an international setting and the trio of girls Beth, Lorna, Whitney(played by Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo, and Bijou Phillips respectively)are all sexy and eager to explore and have fun. Upon a train ride they take the advice from an Eastern Europe model Axelle(Vera Jordanova) to journey to a local village to meet a new clan and visit a famous family hotel called ""Hostel"". Upon doing that back in the states two American losers played by Richard Burgi and Roger Bart(both of ""Desperate Houswives"" fame) are contacted by the family about the girls arrival and decide to then take a vacation for their own sick and gross pleasures! Many of the scenes are gruesome very blood filled and disturbing by seeing flesh and seeing the characters have discomfort. Yet all three female characters still remain sexy as damsels in distress. The most twisted moment and memorable one with skin is of the Heather Matarazzo character as after being abducted she's tied and chained upside down with a gag in her mouth as she begs for mercy from the evident torture. Yet oddly the bloody and shocking end for her is in a somewhat sexual way from another female who delivers the final cut by being bare also(the Matarazzo character's front side is exposed) though gruesome and painful many male viewers can find this as delightful for it's showing of two women with a little skin. Overall ""Hostel: Part II"" is done in a brilliant way by Eli Roth who could become the new master of the horror exploitation film. This film is certainly a good experience blended well with the dark side of sickos, sexy college girls, and it proves that all over the world be careful about visiting new places your unsure with, and a real winner of darkness, evil, and unexplored fear and terror.",Hostel - Part II
32,disdressed12,certainly a step(or three) above part I,4,25 May 2008,"i hated the original Hostel with a passion.so i was surprised that i didn't hate part 2.the story is pretty much the same,with mostly different characters,so of course it's predictable.i didn't find it as sick a the first one.as a matter of fact there are only one or two gory scenes.the first 50 minutes or so are all about the setup just like the first one.,so it's kinda boring.there are a few ludicrous moments,including the ending,which(even though it's ridiculous)most people will see coming a mile away.and i do love the irony of it.this movie is certainly a step(or three)above Hostel I.it's watchable,unlike the first.nevertheless,i would not call this great film making,by any stretch.for me,Hostel II is a 4/10",Hostel - Part II
33,Robert_duder,A promising effort but fails to deliver the proper horror formula,6,18 June 2007,"I will give writer and director Eli Roth credit for both Hostel films because he tried to do something different by creating an entire atmosphere and taking a tired teen horror recipe and scaring the crap out of us and using bucket loads of blood and throwing all caution to the wind when it came to censoring content. Hostel Part II really tries for an intelligent story and really does try to mix it's gory, gratuitous nature into being somewhat self important. The good news is that Hostel Part II really does stand on it's own and the last thing it suffers from is the 'sequel' disease. However on that note Roth made an effort to wrap up the previous plot line and introduce us to new characters by bringing back Jay Hernandez from the original film for a brief tie up on loose ends. This is all very good but then Hostel Part II takes an unusual turn which screamed reminder of me of another little horror film called Turistas which was god awful and pretty downright boring. The beginning of Hostel II spends so much time with these characters and the set up and the in depth story that by the time you actually get to the horror you're almost bored to tears. The first Hostel managed to build up that suspense until the torture began but it just seems to go on far too long in the sequel. Once the horror aspect begins there is definitely some scenes to turn your stomach, including a downright disturbing scene where a woman bathes naked in her victims blood while cutting her. That pretty much takes the cake.Lauren German heads the cast of women as stubborn and strong headed Beth who tries to protect her friends from the danger of Europe but heads down her own trail. German is terrific and definitely holds her own on screen and makes a worthy competitor to the male killers. She's beautiful and feisty and smarter than most scream queens. I hope we see more of her character in the future as she had an...interesting closing. Bijou Phillips is looking very good but rather vapid as the empty headed, wild friend Whitney. She does a good job screaming but her lines are very empty and she's not used for much more than eye candy and a quick, and gory, death. German and Phillips have good chemistry together as best friends. Heather Matarazzo takes on a very disturbing role as their geeky side kick friend who forces them to take her along. She gets the worst torture out of the entire series...or at least the worst shown on screen. She spends a good fifteen minutes suspended naked and tortured with a sickle. She, much like Phillips, is just an added victim as the geek and doesn't get much of a role except screaming. Richard Burgi is terrific as the loud mouth killer determined to release his anxiety by murdering a young girl. His character probably goes through the biggest changes and you expect him to be the most insane but it turns out much differently than that. Roger Bart is his quiet and withdrawn best friend who is being forced into this Hostel situation but discovers his underlying feelings coming out. Bart is also terrific and together with Burgi they turn in the best performances in the entire film. They have great chemistry, good story, and great characters. Bart also gets privy to the second most gory scene in the whole film. And finally leggy Vera Jordanova is the bait for this time around as she peruses the Italian country side for the next victim of the 'Hostel.' She is definitely used for mostly eye candy but she has her uses as far as luring the girls to the evil men.As with most horror sequels I guess I expected non stop gore and guts and nudity and foul language and I almost through Hostel Part II was more tame than the original but a far more calm story leading up to the bad stuff. Whereas the original Hostel really showed some incredible parts of Europe and really gave you this eerie feeling of isolation and fear, Hostel Part II never really did that the same way. It hardly showed any of the countryside or area but rather just assumed we had all seen it from the original but so much of the setting was what gave Hostel it's mood. Still the film was shot almost entirely in Czech Republic but you never got to see any of it really. I suppose as a sequel and follow up to it's superior original it does alright but something was lost in the writing of this one. I imagine we will see a Hostel III and I hope something a little more intelligent can be done with the story. 6/10",Hostel - Part II
34,bowmanblue,Kind of split audiences,7,16 October 2014,"The first 'Hostel' film seemed to be widely-regarded as at least worth a watch (mainly by horror buffs with slightly warped minds – I confess to being one such person). However, the sequel (also written and directed by Eli Roth) was met with a little more disdain.It must have been difficult to write as it was one of those situations where Roth was damned if he did and damned if he didn't. If he tried to be original and created something that was completely different to the first one, he would most likely alienate those who enjoyed the original. Then again, if he stuck to the original people would claim it's just a rehash of the first.It looks like he did the latter. Whereas 'Part I' had three lads holidaying in Slovakia and falling foul to a rather sick and twisted game the locals play, we have three young women in their place. And that's where the first problem lies with many people. It seems that cinema audiences are quite okay with watching men getting ripped open and tortured for fun, but, when it comes to women, it is a little more unsettling. It certainly is harder to watch as the violence has naturally been cranked up in an attempt to 'out-do' the original (which was largely off-screen).The plot may be – largely – the same, but there are a few reasonable little additions that have been thrown in there to try and 'expand' the Hostel universe. Most notable is the inclusion of introducing two men who actually enjoy killing people enough to bid on the rights to kill the girls.However, not matter how the same or different the film is, the bottom line is that it does kind of graphically show torture and violence to young women which did – unsurprisingly – turn off a lot of people. I know it's not real and it's just a film, but this time round it is pretty strong stuff and you may wish you'd just stuck to the original. For die-hards only.",Hostel - Part II
35,dromasca,slightly improved terror,4,4 July 2008,"'Hostel-2' is a slightly improved version of the first film. We are back basically to the same story line and to the same location in a stereotypical Eastern Europe setting, where macabre characters are playing their deadly games. The last survivor of the first film is quickly discarded in a couple of scenes of the beginning providing the link and bridge to this second film. Prisoners are here girls and not boys as in the first movie. Otherwise all looks very similar with some improvements. While we are missing the shock and surprise from the first series, there is more time now to build a better story and even some characters development. Technically it's not a bad film with decent pace and acting but it's still a type of entertainment that needs a solid warning because it may be disturbing for many.",Hostel - Part II
36,MLDinTN,Compared to the first film...,5,4 January 2009,"this sequel has less gore and blood, but the plot is a little more developed. But, since one watches films like this to be shocked, my opinion is the first film was far superior than the sequel. The only real amount of blood comes during the death of Lorna, which was quite gruesome. However, that is the only scene you can even compare to the first film. The 3 American tourists in this movie are a little smarter, but still it doesn't take long for the ""bloodhounds"" to track them down. They try to give the women a little ones up manship by having Beth by her freedom and she even has to get a tattoo. They even get the gang of kids involved in the sequel.FINAL VERDICT: Overall, if you like slasher movies, check this one out; however, don't expect a lot because it is not as good as the first film.",Hostel - Part II

The first one is way better. I really the first hostel movie. I hate this crap. And yes people can like this movie if they want. And Eli Roth did not commit a crime by making this movie. It is not a snuff films because the actors did not really murder each other. I do not like this but please come down people.,Hostel - Part II
39,Thanos_Alfie,Worse than the first...,6,26 March 2018,"""Hostel: Part II"" is a mystery thriller movie and also the sequel of ""Hostel"" in which we watch two stories, in the first we follow three American women who change their plans from partying and having fun and lured to a Slovakian hostel by a European woman. This woman promised them seclusion, fun, and romance. After a while, they understand that everything was a big lie since they are about to be sold to the highest bidder who can do whatever he wants with them and even kill them. On the other side and in the second story we follow two men who want to pay in order to join this exclusive club where they can do whatever they want with their acquisition. I have to admit that I expected more from this movie due to the success of the first movie. I had also high expectations from this movie because I liked the first very much and I believe that it was a very interesting movie because of the plot and also because it was the first so, I did not know what to expect. Since I have watched the first movie unwittingly I compare it with the sequel of it and I have to say that I was disappointed by it. I liked the direction of Eli Roth's and I believe he did a great job on it for one more time. The cast and their interpretations were below average and I believe that was the worst of this movie.Finally, I believe that ""Hostel: Part II"" is an interesting movie that everybody can watch just to spend their time. Do not have high expectations from this movie and you won't be disappointed by it and if you have already seen the first movie then don't expect much from it or think that will even reach the first one. I recommend this movie for everyone to see it either you are alone or with company.",Hostel - Part II
40,johnnyboyz,"Don your surgeon outfit, crank up the buzz saw and get ready for another trip to the Hostel.",6,28 March 2008,"It seems Eli Roth is progressing as a filmmaker; getting better if you will. He seems to make horror films that veer away from the supernatural and produces films that deal with a 'what if you were miles from home and in trouble' scenario. As well as this, he has included a number of things to do with the human psyche in this film; Hostel: Part II, a sequel to the blood soaked first Hostel film, which he hasn't included from my reading in any of his previous attempts. For the best part, Hostel: Part II is an interesting and somewhat eerie look into a situation based in a place the inhabitants we will follow should be no where near.This time, we get an insight into both mentalities of said groups: the hunted as well as the hunters. The hunted are Whitney (Phillips); Beth (German) and Lorna (Matarazzo), three American girls straight out of an episode of The O.C. and on a tour of Europe. But do not let the 'The O.C.' comparison fool you for these people are written and developed in a purposeful manner which will become obvious later on. But on the flip side, two elder Americans named Todd (Burgi) and Stuart (Bart) take up the other half of this exploration into the human psyche. The second strand following the torturers is perhaps the best thing about Hostel: Part II because everything else either goes through the motions similarly to the first film or it is what we've all seen before. But along with these two sadists, we get an insight into the operation as a whole entitled 'Elite Hunting' and the way in which it works which does genuinely make for interesting viewing.It seems obvious now that the Hostel films are all about respect and respect for the country in which you're in. There is no doubt that America is the most powerful country in the world; certainly in the Western world and yet the Americans in both Hostel films take these characteristics with them abroad. There is a scene in which Whitney; the typical, dumb, horny and provocative 'college girl-miss popular' character that things like High School Musical can be blamed for producing in America these days, calls Miroslav (Ianevski) 'Borat', a reference to Cohen's now iconic spoof reporter. She is so ill-educated and naïve about the people from the country in which she is in that she refers to someone with the same name she would've seen in a spoof film from several months ago. There is another instance where Axelle (Jordanova) states that 'there have been no wars in Slovakia for fifty years'. If the girls knew absolutely anything about where they were even going, they'd know that Slovakia hasn't even been around twenty years, let alone fifty.So such ignorance and naivety to assume they're invincible merely because they're from the most powerful country in the world and are 'safe' is explored and exploited by director Roth in an interesting manner. Whilst this film is not as shocking as the first one and whilst this one did not linger in my mind for the next couple of days like the first one did, that is not to say it is inferior. The strand involving the theory behind the organisation and the two torturers going on their 'adventure' is so much more interesting and fresh than the 'three girls going to their doom' strand but that is still executed with the right amount of zest necessary. Roth got the idea for these films after seeing a Thai 'holiday' package where you'd go and kill someone if you paid: that's what Stuart and Todd are doing and if anything, we're invited to see things from their point of view.The reason I say this is because when one of the girls in tied to the chair and scared stiff, we see Stuart walk around the room and explore the tools. Compare this to the first film where we had Josh's point of view as the hood came off; we were the victims but now, we have the power to walk around the cell with Stuart and Todd respectively  we travel to the establishment with them; we get changed with them and we pick up the tools with him. So the reason this does not scare or stay with us after viewing is because we are not seeing things from the oblivious victims point of view. Roth also themes his torture rooms; there is the dining room for 'dining' and the Roman bathroom for 'bathing'. Here is Roth perhaps tapping into sexuality: often people with a sexual fetish will visit a place that has 'themed' rooms for a particular fetish: medical in an operation theatre; school girl in a detention hall or 'police woman/prisoner' in a jail house.The idea that these kids are displayed or maybe 'advertised' to clients echoes the way in which prostitution is sold in Amsterdam  'window shopping' is the term and this idea is manipulated from paying for sex to paying to kill  people who have particular fetishes would pay for scenarios to be acted out with women dominating them the same way a rich person would act out a scenario of murder with an unsuspecting victim. Hostel: Part II may look like torture porn on the surface but I feel the film explores psychology and mentality more than people realise. The final fifteen minutes are rather poor and the film doesn't end strongly but there is enough to take on board here and to 'enjoy' if you're able to.",Hostel - Part II
41,TheMovieDiorama,Hostel Part II butchers its way through another franchise.,3,17 April 2019,"Roth's original Hostel wasn't a masterpiece by any means, only really being a tame horror of the ""torture-porn"" variety. But it had a underlying sense of morality whilst presenting a hyperbolic commentary of human trafficking, even if the execution was mediocre. Roth's sequel however essentially removes all the wholesome family goodness from its predecessor and instead creates a mundane feeling of déjà vu. Why? Because it's the exact same bloody film. Beat for beat. Talk about no imagination Eli! A group of girls travelling Europe venture into the cursed realm of Slovakia where all the creepy men are creepy and rich businessmen everywhere want to torture and kill innocent civilians.Like I said, identical to its predecessor but adding slight more depth to the technicalities of this underground ring of contract obsessed morons. Essentially we witness how the bidding process works. That and the infrequent schlocky gore are probably the only positives. Roth famously stated that he wanted to include three female protagonists to ""up the ante"", however he inadvertently produced a layer of misogyny as a consequence. Every man in Slovakia apparently treat women as disposable objects, and unsurprisingly elicits a distasteful outlook. Perhaps if these characters were somewhat intelligent, then maybe they could've had some sort of backbone. Nope. Alas, just as dumb as the frat men from the first film.Not sure where Roth got the cast from. Maybe strolling through the majestic Slovak villages whilst pointing his finger at random strangers shouting ""You! You're gonna be in my next film!"", because sweet throat-slicing scythes the acting was terrible. The appalling dialogue probably didn't help either. For a ""torture-porn"" film, there really wasn't much torture. Maybe one or two minutes worth? And don't get me started on the ending. What even was that!? Neither thrilling enough to be scary, or sadistic enough to be a valid torture experience. Although to be honest, more torturous than the original, and that's not a good outcome.",Hostel - Part II
42,insomniac_rod,This Hostel is closed for good.,5,22 February 2009,"Well, whatever ""Hostel"" achieved in terms of popularity, shock, quality, and even cult status; this sequel destroyed it but it got in exchange plenty of dollars.The film's opening had potential and reminded me that sometimes sequels are better than the original, specially when you keep connections with the original.We're led to believe that Paxton escaped for good and now will have to start a new life. Sadly for him and his girlfriend, he's murdered in probably the best scene in the movie. In a very MTV style scene but anyhow creepy, Paxton's girlfriend discovers his be-headed body and a cat standing on his neck, licking his blood.Then the film shows that one of the founders of the murder corporation from the original is behind this and now has taken revenge.But things go down when the plot from the original repeats itself but this time with female protagonists. So we will have three tortured women trying to survive exactly the same situations from the original.Expect once again, plenty of torture sequences, boobs (not very nice), and violence.The difference between this sequel and the original is the quality factor. There isn't very much quality on this sequel and that's why I think it's one of the worst torture oriented movies made.Avoid it like the plague, and stick with the original of course, if you liked it.",Hostel - Part II
43,jzappa,Highly Surpasses Original: Some of the Best Characterization of Any Horror Film,8,18 June 2007,"I'll just get it out of the way first off that the first thing this extremely entertaining sequel does is whip two dreaded slasher sequel clichés at us. After that, it does everything even better than the first one did it. The exposition of the first one and the unexpected switches of focus on characters done in the first film were fine, but the effect was light. Here, we are given very interesting broadenings of the story.The gore and violence in Hostel Part II is also far more intense than it was in its predecessor. The extent and situation of torture and murder are only part of its exceeding tension in this sequel. The other part is perhaps the thoughts and level of compassion of the people inflicting it, which is to say frighteningly, remarkably low. The first scene of violence keeps you gripping your seat so tightly that your fingers indent its arms, because it happens slowly and terribly. The other aspect is seen because in this film, the business exchange of kidnapping innocent tourists for appointments where clients torture them any way they want now has a face. We see people who handle the business end of it. We also see, in a wonderful montage, the bankers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, et. al. bidding unsuspectingly on their palm pilots for a fresh new victim. There is no line of morality that we are worried about the characters crossing. We are worried about how much further the line is crossed.The script is better, the horror film delights of violence more intense, and Eli Roth wisely creates sympathy for certain characters, then turns the monsters loose, therefore overall it's much more fun. Hostel Part II understands that character is plot, as each and every character is spot on in thorough definition and development. It's actually quite a shock how impressive the characterizations are. I think Eli Roth is done warming up now. I think his next film will be truly great work.",Hostel - Part II
44,videorama-759-859391,"The price has gone down, as this hostel enters desperation territory",4,22 August 2013,"This Hostel, replacing our two horny Americans, and our hornier Islanic extrovert, we have two female hottie's and their so so cooky friend, (remember her as a younger mixed up teen in the opening of The Devil's Advocate) making the dreaded mistake of going to that corrupted Slovakian hostel, the gay clerk with a slight lisp, staying for this one. We get to know him a bit better in this one too. Again, you're kept waiting a longer time for the torturing and blood letting to begin, although, we're compensated by an interesting opening, that I liked, as it takes up, right from where it left off, with our vengeance seeking Paxton. Unfortunately, we rudely underestimate the fate of the escapees, victims, if they slip through the cracks. Phillips and German, in quite decent performances, are two good reasons to see this sequel, that is milked dry of ideas, and finally reaches desperation stakes, that cheapens the movie. I'm talking about castration, in a scene that doesn't disturb, child murder, but also it resorts to Hannibal Lector's habits. There's a good twist to it's last fifteen minutes, as another one earlier on, concerning a change of heart of an rich American businessman. The trademark scene is of course, the bloodbath one, our so so looking girl, hung upside down from a chain, getting it with a sickle, from a rich 30's American woman, in old Pagan get up, or I should say ""sick"" American woman. There are some similarities in this one as with the first, the innocent guised female friend, who has a bit of a lesbo thing for German, as well as German's revenge in it's finale, following by unfitting jovial violin music, but it must of been for German's victory. A change. Also we're reunited with those f..king dangerous kids who like spitting on American girls. What's also good about this, is that we get to meet the people behind this operation, a family. Just as disturbing as the first, the film is marred purely on it's need for a sequel, it borrows a lot of stuff, already shown in other horror flicks, where it's violence is reprehensible, but pathetic, and by that same token, I mean not real. It devalues the movie, in one sense, making it laughable, in which was quite terrifying at the start. I guess the one thing to learn out of this, besides again, the risk of making sequels, is just don't go to Slovakia, especially with these little street thugs running around. roaming around. Too, have you ever seen two killer dogs, do this much damage to a human being, a big player who ultimately deserved it.",Hostel - Part II

46,freemantle_uk,Gorno Horror,4,3 May 2008,"I saw this film in the cinema because a friend of mine wanted to see it. I had not seen the first film and the horror genre doesn't normally appeal to me because it doesn't normally scare but just be violent. The type of horror films I do like are the Romero's Dead series and 28 Days Later.Hostel Part II is set soon after the events of the first film. The basic premise is that a gang called the Bloodhounds run a Hostel in Slovakia and auction the travellers on an e-Bay like website for people to torture and kill. Three female American travellers at the time were in Rome and planned on going to Prague, it was then when on the train to the Czech Republic that Axelle (Vera Jordanova) convict them to go to Slovakia. When out there they enjoy the local culture, meet some men, get drunk and go the local hot baths and spa. The travellers however were unaware that they are being auctioned on the net and two American men who had won arrived to act on their violence fantasies. One of the men was really up for torturing a young woman and the other more reluctant. As the film progresses the women get kidnapped and prepared to be tortured.Hostel Part II was a controversial film. It was violent and this time the focus of the violence was on women. This film is not going to to be a classic, it is not great, but its okay and this type of film does have an audience. My mate said that this film was more light hearted then the first film and did treat Slovakia with some respect. I thought that the director Eli Roth had a good scam with the first film because he insulted a country and got a first luxury holiday out of it. The acting was decent, most of the time acting in horror films is not of a high standard. It was well polished for a horror film, dark and grim and the violence was realistic for most of the film. There were a few cameos in the film. The film also has a couple of twist which I think work. One a small footnote, after watching the film I joked that what happens was going to happen to me when I went out to Australia: luckily it didn't.",Hostel - Part II
47,dfranzen70,"Listless, dull, uncomplicated",3,11 June 2007,"Hostel 2 is a totally different movie from Hostel 1. This time, it’s three dimwitted female Americans, whereas last time it was two dimwitted male Americans and their equally dimwitted European friend. It’s these differences that are necessary for a sequel to separate itself from its progenitor.As in the first movie, the Americans are lured to a lurid youth hostel in Slovakia, whereupon they’re to be tortured in inventive manners by rich businessmen from around the world. The young women are Beth (Lauren German), the smart-but-cute one (not too pretty but certainly not a fugly); Whitney (Bijou Phillips), the mean-and-skanky one; and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), the shy, sneezy one. (There you go, the Three Clueless Dwarfs: Smarty, Skanky, and Sneezy.)The girls are headed to Prague when a sexy stranger (Vera Jordanova) tells them about therapeutic hot springs in Slovakia. Being raised to be cautious around strangers, the girls don’t decide to take their new friend’s advice until they’ve all had some time for girl talk.Only one true spirit can survive a horror movie, and it’s pretty easy to figure out who’s being positioned as the Good Guy who will live to see Hostel 3: Robots in Your Bedroom. By the same token, it’s also easy to see who among the bad, evil torturing rich dudes will turn out to be hunky dory. We know this because there’s an inordinate amount of time spent on the two guys who win the auction that gives them the right to torture Beth and Whitney. One of the guys seems reticent, almost unsure whether he wants to get into this business at all, while his buddy is gung-ho and ready to start some creepy pain-giving.The method that the secret torture society uses is unchanged; they plant young travelers in the hostel and pay them to lure the tourists to their doom. The hostel itself is complicit, as the creepy-looking desk clerk scans the girls’ passports and puts their pictures on the auction site, thus setting the bidding in motion. And they would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for these meddling kids. Oh, wait, that implies they don’t get away with it.Blah, blah, blah, the kids get separated, despite all omens of Bad Things Afoot. I mean, look, they’re alone in a foreign country, and most of the citizens don’t speak English. They’re the very picture of Ugly Americans, in that they think nothing could possibly happen to them, no matter how loutish they behave. It does not speak well for the movie when you quickly hope not only that they’re captured and tortured but that it’s sooner rather than later. You’re supposed to be rooting for these three girls (yeah, I know, they’re technically women, but they don’t act like it), and yet they’re so annoying, so steadfastly stupid, and so perfectly one dimensional that you openly wish for their demise. Bad start.When we finally do get to the torture scenes, our rooting interest hasn’t really changed, although we know in our hearts that our feisty girls are going to come out on top somehow. Well, at least one of them, anyway. As with the first movie, there are some truly garish gore scenes; this isn’t a movie for those with weak constitutions, although oddly enough no one throws up on screen. Just lots and lots and lots of blood.The movie feels particularly misogynistic, too; in the first one, the guys were ultimately killed because they were simply overpowered and outwitted and outgunned by the bad guys, but in this one the girls suffer because they are dumb and flighty and self-absorbed. Here’s a good indication of how bad the movie is - people are killed, tortured, maimed, what have you, but what REALLY sets off our heroine is a certain four-letter word that begins with the letter C. Yes, up till that point - when she’d been shackled and humiliated - she was as tolerant as she could be, but man, once the Bad Guy calls her a C-word, oh NO HE DIDN’T! At that point you just know she’s gonna be okay, and he might not be.There’s an interesting opening bit that ties the end of the first film to this one, but that’s about the only connection there is between the two, other than the general rich-American-kids-get-tortured-and-killed bit. It’s actually one of the more suspenseful and powerful scenes in the entire movie. But overall this is a dead movie, listlessly throwing buckets of blood at the audience in hopes that something goopy will stick. It’s a prime example of a sequel that’s been mailed in, what with a nearly identical plot. There are a couple of twists tossed in to keep things mildly interesting, but it’s all for nothing. And the ending is completely unnecessary, other than to prepare us for the next installment of a so-called franchise that should have quit at one.",Hostel - Part II

I not going to waste time on the plot as on the main page and there not much plot in this movie. There was decent gory nasty scene in this movie, which i thought a bit cringe but scary or gory at all. The nudity in this movie was big higher then first movie, which dose make care less about characters in this movie.

49,MaxBorg89,"More of the same: blood, torture and occasional brilliance",7,15 July 2008,"Hostel: ""the sickest, most disgusting, f*cked-up horror movie ever"", in the words of its director Eli Roth. Naturally, the actual film was nothing like it. The same promotional hyperbole hit the sequel, Hostel: Part II, which does in fact have at least one sequence that will rank high on anyone's yuk-o-meter (yep, that would be the notorious castration scene), but is ultimately quite similar to its predecessor: not groundbreaking horror, but good enough to stand the test of time thanks to its admittedly clever concept.This time around, Roth decides to raise the stakes: no more guys who get tortured in the Slovakian Elite Hunting factory (as a matter of fact, the sole survivor of the first movie is swiftly executed ten minutes into Part II), but three American girls (Lauren German, Bijou Phillips and Heather Matarazzo), since women are, by nature, easier to sympathize with in a horror film; plus, we get to know more about the torture organization, which is run by a creepy old man named Sasha (Milan Knazko), and its clients, here represented by Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart), two businessmen who feel the urge to do something radical to shake themselves out of boredom. The only thing that's even remotely similar to the first film (apart from the person who tricks the victims into coming to Slovakia, in this case a Russian model played by Vera Jordanova) is the presence of the Bubble Gum Kids, who once again have a vital role in the plot's development.This decision to expand on the original picture's ""mythology"" (somehow that word feels wrong when referring to the horror genre) proves to be very wise, as it prevents Roth from doing a mere photocopy of the first Hostel. However, it also exposes his biggest flaw as a writer: flimsy characterizations. As expected, the villains are as well developed as you can get them (and Burgi and Bart have a great time participating in a project that's light years away from Desperate Housewives), but the leading trio is a mixed bag: German is OK, Phillips is mostly rubbish, and Matarazzo, who's supposed to be the one viewers should care for the most, doesn't have enough screen-time to impose herself. As for Jordanova, she isn't meant to be anything more than a plot gimmick and therefore any shortcomings in her performance are acceptable.Then there's another problem that also popped up in the previous installment: the torture scenes. The Tarantino-inspired trick of not showing most of the blood doesn't quite work (primarily because Roth lacks QT's visual finesse), and aside from a superbly realized (literal) bloodbath, which cunningly combines five minutes of suspense and thirty seconds of full-on gore, none of the set-pieces are that memorable, especially if compared to the repetitive, but more inventive Saw franchise.Nevertheless, Roth deserves plaudits for pulling off another QT stunt much better, namely indulging his geek fantasies by casting his childhood idols in minor roles: having Luc Merenda (a former star of very violent European thrillers) and Edwige Fenech (the queen of Italian sex comedies in the late '70s and early '80s) in the first few minutes of the film is very good, while Ruggero Deodato's deliberately provocative appearance as a cannibal (you see, he directed the controversial Cannibal Holocaust) is close to genius. Roth may not have the subtlety of vintage Carpenter of the satirical streak of Romero, but he could become a Yankified version of the brilliantly extreme Takashi Miike, who had a cameo in Hostel and would probably be proud of the disturbingly amusing final scene of this ambitious, flawed but perfectly watchable follow-up.",Hostel - Part II

51,a_baron,Hostel: Part II,3,26 December 2015,"There is nothing wrong with horror, nor with thrillers, but what is right with this combination? The beginning is a bit disjointed, but that is because it is a segue from the previous venture. The bottom line is that there is an organisation in Eastern Europe that offers those of a certain mentality the opportunity to murder or even torture people to death, obviously for a hefty price. Naturally the victims are attractive young women, but to deflect any allegations of misogyny, there are male victims too, and not all the bad guys wear trousers. Also, the victims in the first film were predominantly male. There are a couple of obvious cultural references for those in the know about real life horror and Quentin Tarantino: Mrs Bathory who bathes in blood takes her name from the real life Blood Countess, and what was that film they were watching on television?Okay, there were some decent special effects, but torture and murder for the sake of it...is it any wonder mass shootings are on the rise and even teachers are not safe even in their own classrooms?

52,drownnnsoda,"Preferred Over The First Film, But That's Not Saying Much.",4,8 June 2007,"""Hostel: Part II"" follows a group of American art students who are studying in Rome. Among them are good-girl Beth (Lauren German), wild Whitney (Bijou Phillips), and the soft-spoken Lorna (Heather Matarazzo). This group of girls end up on a train to Prauge, where they meet a model, Axelle (Vera Jordanova), who convinces them to go to Slovakia with her to a mineral spring spa. The girls arrive to Slovakia, where they enjoy spending a few days at the youth hostel. Little do they know, the girls have been auctioned off to wealthy tycoons who want to find the thrill in their murder - and at an abandoned warehouse, they can do that. Soon after, the three young women are taken off to the warehouse one by one, where their grisly fates await them - but can they make it out alive?To be put plainly, I didn't like the original ""Hostel"". The only reason I saw this was because a friend of mine convinced me to go, I would've rather seen something else. To my surprise, I enjoyed this movie a little more than I did the first, if that means anything. Story-wise, this movie is essentially a complete rehash of the events in the original, minus the fact that our main characters are young women rather than a bunch of hormone-crazed guys. There are some tweaks on the story as well, so it isn't a complete copy. Some of the writing is clever (and I thought there was a small bit more of depth, for instance the exploration of the ""businessmen"" themselves who were paying to torture), but it has it's fair share of problems as well. I thought the film got off to a decent start, but after sitting through the first thirty minutes my hopes for it diminished. Like in it's predecessor, ""Hostel: Part II"" contains some utterly ridiculous moments. At times I wasn't sure if the movie was going for a bad comedy or a horror flick - it balances on that line awkwardly, and it doesn't work out well. That was one of my biggest problems with the original, the humor just didn't work. Both of these movies could have been very suspenseful and terrifying, but the attempt at dark comedy and the over-the-top violence ruined it.As expected, the violence and gore is amped up for this sequel, and I was thoroughly grossed out on quite a few moments. But the problem is that that's basically all Eli Roth knows how to do. Sure, I may have squirmed - but was I scared? Of course not. The idea that the ""Hostel"" films are based upon is intriguing, but you need some solid suspense and terror to get a good reaction out of me, and this movie failed to do that. Call me old fashioned, but the majority of these gore-filled ""horror"" movies don't cut it for me. As for the acting, that was one thing I did enjoy about this movie - I personally liked the cast. Lauren German (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake) plays our lead quite well, along with Bijou Phillips (""Venom"") who turns in a good performance in the type of role she plays often. And Heather Matarazzo (""Scream 3"") was excellent in her role as the quirky and naive Lorna. I have to admit, I did care about the characters in this movie, so in that sense it did something right in my eyes, but that is mainly due to the actors, and nothing else. As for the finale of the film, it ended with another ridiculous gag that was attempting to be funny, but I just thought it made the film seem even more unbelievable and stupid.Overall, ""Hostel: Part II"" is one gross flick, but the gore doesn't do anything for the story. It's awkward balance of humor and horror doesn't mesh, and the ridiculous gore gags in this film add to it's stupidity more than it's scariness. The cast was good, I'll give it that - but unfortunately they can't redeem it. I'll admit I enjoyed it a tad bit more than I did the original (and I was ""entertained"" throughout it), but that's really not saying much. If you didn't like the original, I wouldn't bother seeing this sequel. I could tolerate it, but it's nothing even remotely remarkable. 4/10.",Hostel - Part II
53,davispittman,Just slightly better than the first,7,11 February 2016,"OK, I had to think long and hard about how to review this sequel. This movie gave me mixed feelings. I thought this film was just slightly better than the original. They upped the ante on the gore factor which I didn't like. There was a couple scenes in particular that I that I thought were way too graphic. The acting was actually pretty good. The main actresses did very well with their roles, I enjoyed them in this movie. The gang of crazy kids from the first Hostel are in this movie, and I didn't like them at all, they were one of the worst parts of this film. Paxton does make a brief appearance in this movie. I didn't like that his character was killed off, that kinda made me mad. I thought his character should have lived. OK, so the plot overall I thought was better executed than in the first. I thought this movie was just overall better handled that the original. I think that like I said earlier, the graphic nature of a couple scenes I just thought they took it too far. For example, the shower scene, aka the death of one character, was just too dark and way too graphic, I did not enjoy that, I don't know who could like that! I mean I had to look away, it was just too much. But I did like the other two main female characters, they were tough and could really defended themselves, and the two main male antagonists, they did pretty well with their roles, it was kinda like a oh I'm big Macho and tough, and I must make women fear me type of thing. I thought that attitude was fitting, if of course bothered me because I'm a big feminist, but it was supposed to bother me because they were evil so they did their job on that part. Overall, it was better than the first in my opinion, but I had a pretty big issue with the amount of gore. 7/10 Hostel: Part II.",Hostel - Part II

This film also following two characters are curious, how it's like to torture and kill someone. These actors are played terrifically by Roger Bart as ""Stuart"" and Richard Burgi as ""Todd"".

But the sequel still have many great concepts and it's certainly better looking than the first one. Which this film came out during the summer, i felt it wasn't a good plan to release it with the usual Blockbusters that came out this summer. I think Roth improves greatly as a film-making skulls with his two previous pictures. I felt this film, it's Roth best film so far and ""Hostel Part 2"" isn't for all tastes like his previous movies. Part 2 will certainly play much better on DVD. It is also in the matter of personal taste. Which film, you loved best. The original or the sequel. So, please... judge for yourself. Super 35.

56,JoeKarlosi,Hostel: Part II (2007) ***,7,20 October 2010,"HOSTEL PART II is one of those occasional sequels that gets it right and is just as good, or maybe even somewhat better, than its predecessor. The general plot is the same as the last one: a group of American friends travel to Slovakia for a good time, but become unknowing victims of a sick hunting group, whose wealthy clients are sadists who place high bids for the privilege of securing naive vacationers to torture for their own pleasures. The difference this time is that the unknowing partyers are now females, and their characters are more interestingly drawn so we have more of a concern in what happens to them. This is especially the case for the first torture victim, terrorized in a depraved sequence that is best left unspoiled here, except to say that in nearly 50 years of viewing all kinds of twisted horror movies, this remains one of the most effectively disturbing kills I have ever witnessed. Also new to the formula is we now get to meet two of the rich male customers who pay to fulfill their murderous fantasies. We follow their path from regular guys next door to homicidal predators on a mission to relieve their untamed kicks. Though I'm not so sure the impact is as intense when we know the torturers as it is those times when the patrons are kept as anonymous sickies. These gruesome films are definitely not for every audience, but the scares are the real deal. No aliens or werewolves or vampires of fiction here; instead director Eli Roth drives home the discomfort of realizing that even the guy standing in front of you at the supermarket may be your own unhinged angel of death, looking to mutilate you slowly with relish. *** out of ****",Hostel - Part II

58,TdSmth5,Surprisingly uninspired,6,27 June 2007,"Everything that made the first Hostel great, is absent in this movie: teenage fun, beautiful naked girls, outrageous gore. Instead we get lots of full frontal male nudity- is this movie little Eli's coming out of the closet?-, slow pacing, and somewhat more of a mean streak. Roth blindly follows the decade old Hollywood agenda of making the main cast all-female with males having only secondary roles. The problem is that none of the females here are particularly engaging. Bijou gets the best role and runs with it but is dispatched in a pathetic cowardly way--off screen! That means that one of the females will have to become our action heroine--yawn... Where is the gore anyways and the naked girls? On the positive note, there are some thoughtful moments here as in the conversation of the two male customers discussing why they are going to do what they are going to do. The Bathory scene is great with an older women finally getting naked and revelling in blood. It provides some much needed break from all the unnecessary male genitals. The cannibal scene is also good and the effects there are outstanding. But clearly this is a much more toned down movie than it needs to be, it's also more generic Hollywood stuff: weak sequel, grlpower, men are evil, female nudity is bad, etc.",Hostel - Part II
59,ptb-8,"Utter hatred, slick and shameless..",1,27 July 2007,"What a group the Roth Family must be. Clever indulged thirty something son Eli makes movies about human beings physically and emotionally ripping each other to shreds. These films allow Eli to wallow and depict hatred in as many forms as his well educated mind allows. In HPt 1 we were shown intergenerational mutilation where old men cut young men and drill their bodies while they scream. Later in the film the young man furiously slits blasts and slices his way to freedom. I have no idea what Eli wanted us to feel about all this as the film basically imploded into its own putrid self-destruction..... apart from promise a sequel... and it turned up in multiplexes too, courtesy of soul-less film executives and the king of fetid hatred towards his fellow man and woman, the hollow Quentin Tarantino.... Young Eli, the joker's disciple, this time around offers us screaming distressed females, a ti-tty bloodbath, a crying woman impaled on a hook, and even practices some violence for children perhaps to be found if his banker gargoyles give him $ for part three: kiddie torture porn. Do all Eli's family incl granny and cousins go to his premieres? Are they happy about the imagery splattered like a methane nappy across the screen before them? Are they proud? His father infamously declared to outraged journalists (quizzing him about his vicious director son) ""My son is the sanest person I know... his films are like Grimmms fairy tales for the MTV generation"" which elicited guffaws across the media. Eli, trying to justify his fascination for mutilating young people said in an Austraila/Cannes interview on ABC TV: 'Since 9/11 this young generation has not been able to scream about their world, I am helping them do that"". The look of disgust on the interviewer's face was priceless (unlike Eli's soul). The utter hilarity and contempt for the Roth family and their attempts to justify what is basically pornographic-blood hatred on film I believe will haunt them in a more effective way than any of Eli's tragic movies. Years ago, I saw a family celebrating a 21st at a nightclub: even the parents had taken amphetamines in order to bridge the generation and 'join their daughter' in a way she liked. I think of that pathetic sight and years later wonder at the cringe moments they must shudder through as they realize their silly daughter dragged them down and debased their family in a way they could never have imagined. Today I think of Eli Roth and his father trying to explain the unexplainable depravity in which their son excels. What a sad sight they are, Eli's destructive appetite wanting to show mutilated crying women as some sort of 'friday night popcorn fun in a shopping center cinema'. Later generations will corner Eli and their grandparents and just cry at what he has done to his family and the unlimited scope of world cinema by choosing to make and support visual vandalism like HOSTEL and this rotten PART 2. I have never seen a spectacular failure like this. I hope I and You never again do either. I wonder at what age my 8 year old niece will see this when she stays at a sleepover at a friends house and this mind destruction is smuggled in by another kid who finds it in their older brother's room, or at the back of the DVD store. Children will see HOSTEL PART 2. Eli knows that. I do to. Eli even said in an interview: ""6 reasons why this film will f**k you up"" . Goodbye Eli.. you are spending your life in death. Eli needs to discover real directors and real films and real people's feelings. Or maybe Tarantino really does own Eli's circumcised soul.For exact insight to the real minds of the creators and participants of this catastrophe, get the DVD and go into 'extras'; click into 'deleted scenes' and watch 'rape shower'. In this moment of utter disgust, we see two girls come home tipsy. One begs the other to 'do the rape shower'. So she does this pantomime where she pretends to be a distressed girl who has been raped and is now under a shower crying ""I've been raped... I've been raped"" she murmurs in a pretend distressed bewildered state. The other girl who asked for the moment then laughs, stamps her foot in hilarity as she roars with laughter, all doubled up with glee. ""oh that is so funny"" she says, before walking away. .......... How could these two female actors agree to be filmed doing this? Rape to Eli Roth and its psychological distress is comedy to him. Apparently to these two women actors as well. This scene was written and filmed by Eli Roth. He wanted it there and he wants you to see it and join in the moment, otherwise why put it there? Even though it was deleted from the cinema print, it is there in the DVD for you all to see. In that one scene we have the key to the desires of Mr Roth. See it, never forget it, and know your enemy.",Hostel - Part II
60,TOMNEL,Never let Eli Roth make another movie.,1,14 June 2007,"After his first two terrible films, ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Hostel"", he gives us more of the same sick and twisted film-making with this awful movie. Eli Roth obviously has no talent, and makes up for his lack of anything redeeming, with tons of extreme violence. That's all this was...violence. This film had no point. There was no reason why this should have been made. The plot is that people are bidding money to kill people staying in a hostel. We see the side of the girls who suffer through this, and we see the side of two people who are going to kill these girls. And that, along with gallons of gore, sums up the film. It's obvious that Eli Roth has a sick sense of humor that you can see in his films, but it's more sick than funny. It doesn't make this movie lighthearted, it makes it hard to stomach. The only good thing Mr. Roth has ever done is a fake trailer in ""Grindhouse"" and I hope he goes off to make fake trailers, because he does not deserve to pass his drivel as movies.My rating: BOMB/****. 88 mins. rated R for extreme violence, language, drug use, full frontal nudity.",Hostel - Part II
61,Jonny_Numb,"To quote Jane's Addiction: ""Nothing's Shocking""",2,30 June 2007,"In our post-millennial horror ""golden age,"" writer/director/hype whore Eli Roth (he of Cabin Fever and Hostel...Part I infamy) has become the genre equivalent of Dane Cook--while not bringing a single new or innovative idea to the table, he has nonetheless achieved a baffling level of popularity. But while Cook's stand-up routine occasionally elicits a laugh or two, Roth is as lost as ever in a genre that has (inexplicably) embraced him with dismembered arms. Which begs the question: are horror fans setting their standards lower, or am I just a crabby old fart, nostalgic for the days when narrative, character, and suspense comprised a great scare film? While horror cinema has been thriving in terms of sheer product lately, the efforts themselves have become increasingly fickle, blood-drenched freak shows; William Friedkin's recent Bug aimed for a minimalist, character-driven tone and was met with apathy at the box office. Which begs yet another question: is torture horror's new currency? Roth certainly seems to be banking on it. I remained in a diplomatic mindset as I started the lamely-titled Hostel: Part II. Sure, I viewed its predecessor as a shallow, sick-for-an-R-rated-mainstream-film torture show with misguided delusions of social relevance (to say that its ""commentary"" parallels the human rights violations of Abu Graib or Guantanmo Bay is a real stretch), but held out a flicker of hope for this sequel (don't ask me why). But after the first few minutes, I was just reminded all over of the reasons I have hated Roth's previous work (his Grindhouse trailer notwithstanding).This time out, smug American fratboys are traded for 3 vacationing girls who are just as blandly drawn, each possessing one stock trait that serves to define their character: Rich Girl (Lauren German, the suicide from the Texas Chainsaw remake); Slutty Girl (Bijou Phillips, in a real masterstroke of casting); and Nerdy Girl (Heather Matarazzo, thanklessly reprising Dawn Weiner). With dialog on a sub-""Screen writing 101"" level, one would think that Roth would speed up the ""money shots"" we all know he is anxiously waiting to unleash on his all-too-expectant audience (the numbingly ominous musical cues that permeate seemingly every scene portend as much). But no--Hostel: Part II is so sluggishly paced (much like its predecessor) that the film is 3/4 over by the time we get to said ""excess."" In the meantime, footage of our freewheeling females is intercut with a subplot (or main plot, though it certainly isn't presented with any urgency) of two American-businessmen chums: Todd (Richard Burgi), who fancies himself a gung-ho sadist, pumped at the idea of torturing his TBA victim; and Stuart (Roger Bart)--a meek, soft-spoken guy who appears to be reluctantly following his friend. The macho-sadist relationship that exists between these two would have been an interesting psychological avenue to explore, but is let down by Roth's lazily indifferent writing--the axiom being, I suppose, that everything leading up to the inevitable climactic bloodbath is ultimately irrelevant.This time out, Roth's affront is not the exploitative nature of his violence, but the laughable way in which it is rendered. The first torture sequence, for instance, is a silly, drawn-out homage to Elizabeth Bathory (done with more subtlety and effect in 1971's Daughters of Darkness), with a nude woman quite literally bathing herself in virgin's blood (at just the right soft-core porn angles, too). The remaining ""money shots"" come off as surprisingly pedestrian, and even some 11th-hour character twists cannot raise the pulse of Hostel: Part II--by relying on a few gross-out setpieces, the film comes off as little more than a coy co-opting of the far more unflinching Euro-horrors Roth is quoting. As most casual filmgoers in this day and age are largely unfamiliar with auteurs like Lucio Fulci, Dario Argento, and Ruggero Deodato (who has a cameo), Roth has taken it upon himself to ""borrow"" their extremes and water them down for domestic consumption.Watch Cannibal Holocaust. Then watch Hostel: Part II. My point exactly.Strangely enough, cinema splatter has become such an anomaly that its presence is accepted--expected, even. While I have no problem with this (and, to a certain degree, embrace it), I don't think it's unfair for horror-goers to demand something more than the tepid tapwater Roth is peddling as Wild Turkey here.For a while, certain elements of Hostel: Part II run the risk of redeeming the film--German proves herself a capable and resourceful Final Girl, even though her character is underdeveloped and saddled with the aforementioned below-par dialog, to the point where the closing ""twist"" is simply an ineffectual throwaway. Same goes for Bart, whose Stuart almost threatens to cut through the tedium with his near-cuddly, reluctant portrayal; but again, Roth betrays the character with a poorly-realized, Third-Act twist that comes out of nowhere and borders on the absurd. Roth's intent of influencing narrative flow through these two characters is admirable in theory, but calls for a capable writer-director who can address the layers of psychosis boiling under the surface. And for a director more consumed with ""gore-nography"" than anything else, Roth is hardly the man for the job.Ultimately, Hostel: Part II is nowhere near the amoral-till-death world of Pasolini's Salo, nor the full-bore, gleefully repugnant realism of Cannibal Holocaust, nor the warped masculine-feminine fever dream of Audition--it teeters along the edges of those extremes, flinching when it should be glaring on in helpless disgust. Roth presents revulsion as a tease, a toothless entertainment (if it can be called that) built on hype he isn't even remotely interested in delivering on.No publicity is bad publicity, eh?",Hostel - Part II
62,a_chinn,"Effective sequel goes behind-the-scenes of the Elite Hunting Club, even if it offering nothing new thematically",8,23 December 2017,"Worthy sequel picks up where the original left off, with the one surviving protagonist of the first film, Jay Hernandez, back in America but still haunted by his ordeal. The film quickly cuts to a new group of ugly Americans abroad, this time a group of girls instead of boys, again with two party girls and one good-girl character. Writer/director Eli Roth wisely doesn't try to simply retell the same story again and he comes up with a smart solution for where to take the story, since the first film already revealed the purpose of ""Elite Hunting Club,"" who offer torture and murder to the rich and powerful, this time taking the audience behind-the-scenes club's operations. Besides following a new group of girls who are target of the club, it also follows two rich guys on their first experience with the hunting club (one full of bluster and the other more mild mannered) along with their build up to their eventual descent into the torture chamber. As you'd expect, the two stories collide, but with quite unexpected results. My main complaint about the sequel is that it doesn't offer anything new thematically, but in terms of suspense and shock value, the film does manage to live up to the original and even exceed the first film in some respects. As with the first film, ""Hostel: Part II"" does not have wide appeal value and most viewers would find it a repellent endurance test, but if you are part of that narrow band of horror fans who this film does target, ""Hostel: Part II"" is a must see.",Hostel - Part II
63,RainDogJr,"American Students in Europe, Italian Cannibals, Hostels",8,25 August 2008,"With the DVD you can hear both Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino saying that Cannibal Holocaust is one of their favourites films (for Tarantino it is one of the best Italian horror films in the last 30 years) obviously in reference to the cameo of its director Ruggero Deodato. During Hostel we can see a cameo of Takashi Miike and it was great for me but not great because the actual scene but just because was Miike and it was a homage from Eli Roth to one of his influences. I have recently watched for the first time a film of Deodato so it was great to know that he was here but actually his scene is really terrific and memorable, much better than the scene with Miike. Deodato plays the Italian Cannibal, a member of the Elite Hunting who is in the factory just to enjoy a great dinner. On the DVD also we can see Deodato explaining why he accepted to be part of Hostel Part II and how was his first meeting with Eli Roth. Is funny to see how Roth arrived with Deodato just as a big fan with some t- shirts and poster of Cannibal Holocaust, probably in a similar way of how the guys of Grindhouse Releasing arrived with Roger Kerman for that interview. I wonder how could have been the reaction of Roger Kerman if Eli Roth went with him as a big fan of Cannibal Holocaust in order to make him part of his new film (see Roger Kerman interview in the Cannibal Holocaust DVD). Eventually Roth did cast some of his ""idols"", Luc Merenda and Edwige Fenech. However and honestly I have never watch a film with any of these two actors but there are some other references to the Italian horror films; Americans in Europe for studying, for example. Hostel Part II is about these American students, they are three girls: Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips) and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo). Now is like a routine and even when they arrived to the hostel Pulp Fiction is been watching again! Of course we know that once these girls are in Slovakia everything will be like before, their luck is over but did I mention that almost since the beginning of the film we are learning more about the mysterious and extremely sick Elite Hunting? Well after the ""Paxon situation"" we are introduced to Sasha (Milan Kňako) and we see how this business works, how the information travels, how a ""normal"" looking person can be winning and buying the ""right"" to kill. These businessmen are in a way similar to Patrick Bateman, obviously are extremely rich and are sick people. Hostel Part II is about what's behind the sick business and yes it is a really big business, on that way I found some things of the ""friendship"" of Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart) quite interesting and definitely that works. The main reason of why they want to kill delivers a great conversation. But anyway Hostel Part II is sold as the torture film it is and here we have for me the best scenes from both this and the original. The first torture is the best thing on that way even with a reference Elizabeth Báthory (I have seen in parts the film Immoral Tales that features the story of Elizabeth Báthory and by watching this scene I quickly remembered it for obvious reasons). It is going to sound very gay but the ""d*** sequence"" is quite good and delivers absolute fun in a similar way Tarantino, as the rapist, delivered in Planet Terror. In the last part of the film we have a twist that maybe is not that surprising as I guess Eli Roth wanted and it is as simple as the ""psycho looking"" guy turned to be not as sick as himself wanted to be and his friend, the one who was more ""normal"" turned to be a sick bastard tired of his life. These two are the protagonist of the film and Beth is the only girl that stands up from the rest. Since the beginning we know her as the smart one of the group and sure her friends have the best intentions in order to protect each other but at some point they become the guys from part I specially the first victim. How much does a life cost? That's the question of the movie and by watching Beth with life sure a life cost a lot. If Hostel was mostly like a disappointment thanks to all the hype Hostel Part II is mostly like a pleasant surprise and in other way to say it, I liked this movie just like the first one. Still both are not great movies but still is really funny to hear Quentin talking about movies and stuff and yes Eli we already know that you really appreciate the support of Quentin. I heard the DVD commentary, the producers' commentary, for just about 40 minutes and later just in some specific scenes. Is a little annoying these two together but Quentin is quite funny!",Hostel - Part II
64,Matt_Layden,Seemed more tame to me.,4,9 February 2011,"Hostel Part II flips the genders and now we have three women, instead of men, going through Europe. They stay at the hostel from the first film and soon become victims of the rich man's torture game.I like Eli Roth, even if I'm that that big a fan of his movies. I didn't really dig the first Hostel and this one doesn't fare any better. The guy is trying his best to re-invent horror, yet he seems to be one of the followers. For me, each decade had some interesting horror films. The 80's had cheesy horror movies and gave us some iconic horror characters. The 90's re- invented the slasher genre with Scream and then we hit this decade and we have what people are calling torture porn. Saw, Hostel and countless other movies that throw victims into the clutches of a mad man who tortures them. Hostel, for what it's worth, was a little bit entertaining. The third act of the film added some suspense and thrills. Hostel II has none of this. It feels like build up to nothing. There was only one scene that was interesting, the blood bath sequence. Creepy, hot and horror quality. The rest of the film was disappointing. Roth should know that people are going to see this move for those torture scenes, which made the first film a success. This film has none of that. The girls are great too look at, but their characters are irritating. This film tried to show a bit of the other side, the rich torture guys. We get two characters who pay to kill these girls and predictably, one goes soft and the other one looses it. Roth tries so hard to shove the fact that one guy is psyched to do this while the other is hesitant, it's obvious that one of them would flake out. I even called which guy. Hostel Part II lacks the good parts that made the first one watchable...and I didn't even like the first one. I'm still waiting for Roth to deliver us something truly worthy of the horror genre. Cabin Fever and the Hostel films just fall short of that.",Hostel - Part II

The gore & violence was great as always & didn't disappoint.However, the film felt somewhat unfinished or rushed to me, not too sure. That & the film just wasn't as good in general, the ending felt a bit misandry & girl power. I don't know I was getting those vibes from watching the 2nd time round.Overall it's good but not as good as the first Hostel. 7/10",Hostel - Part II
66,brando647,A Semi-Fresh Perspective on the Same Old Torture,6,24 December 2012,"I was not a major fan of Eli Roth's original HOSTEL but I liked what it was trying to do. I enjoyed its terrifying version of reality in which victims were sold to psychotic businessman for torture and murder. While I managed to enjoy HOSTEL for what it was, I don't remember walking away from the movie thinking it was prime for a sequel. But, such is the way with modern movies, if a film does well enough, it's bound to revisit the material in another adventure. So we return to Slovakia and the quaint hostel where attractive college age students gather for a bit of culture and fun and ultimately find themselves strapped to a chair in front of an array of torture tools. Roth does manage to lead the second movie into some new territory but it ultimately feels like we've been here before. Because we have. This time around, we're following three beautiful girls as they vacation their way across Europe. An encounter with a gorgeous artists' model leads the girls in the direction of Slovakia where they settle in to the infamous hostel. In what comes as a surprise to no one who'd seen the original, the girls are being led into a trap where they are auctioned off to the highest bidder for some violent encounters. Meanwhile, we meet Todd and Stuart, two successful American businessmen who are interested in experiencing what Elite Hunting has to offer. In HOSTEL PART II, we're given a chance to witness the horrors from both sides of the buzz-saw.We retread a lot of the same ground here as we did in the first HOSTEL movie, except now we know what tricks to expect. We suspect every suave European that crosses our victims' paths. Even people we once believed might have been innocent are proved to be a part of this grand scheme to make money off the blood of travelers. The gore has been amped up a bit from the last movie. Whereas a recent viewing of HOSTEL reminded me that it's not as horrifically violent as I remember and a lot of the worst bits happen out of frame, HOSTEL PART II has some real cringe-worthy moments. There's a scene paying homage to the historically infamous Lady Bathory that makes me wince every time. And all the ""girl power"" this movie is juiced up on leads to a final scene that is nauseating enough to affect even the toughest man. The gore effects in this movie are certainly as good if not better than the original. Again, we're given plenty of time to become acquainted with the victims before they're led to the slaughter but, again, the problem is that I just don't care. Beth (Lauren German, the heroine) is established pretty well and she comes across as intelligent and responsible, which means you'll be rooting for her to come out on top. Her friend Whitney (Bijou Phillips) is just unlikeable and their roommate Lorna (Heather Matarazzo) is just sonaïve and sad. You just feel bad for the girl from the start, when she's shunned by the pompous Whitney. She never catches a break and suffers one of the worst fates.This movie is saved from 100% repetition by introducing a new angle: giving us perspective from Elite Hunting. Elite Hunting is the organization behind these murder auctions and, since we've already seen it from the victims' eyes in the first movie, we get to see the entire process of how business is transacted. This was the interesting part for me. We witness every stage of the process, from bidding to execution (punintended?), and we follow it from the perspective of the two American businessmen, Todd and Stuart. Todd (Richard Burgi) is your average alpha-male go-getter, while Stuart (Roger Bart) is a whipped, subservient husband. The two travel to Slovakia after their placing their winning bids and try to remain psyched for the brutality they get to deliver; soon they'll be ""real"" men. Their story proved to be the more interesting of the two we're given in HOSTEL PART II, but we don't spend nearly as much time with them because, duh, they're the bad guys. HOSTEL PART II expands upon a mildly interesting premise but I didn't feel like it was enough to warrant an entire film. Maybe some extra features on the HOSTEL DVD but not a sequel. Fans of the genre will probably find plenty to enjoy here but I saw it as nothing more than a follow-up that failed to live up to the gritty chills of the first one.",Hostel - Part II
67,moviewizguy,Extended Version Review,5,16 April 2008,"Three female college students take a detour from their partying, enticed by a beautiful European woman who promises seclusion, safety and maybe even romance. What they get is a living hell where they are sold to the highest bidder who's fondest wish is to kill them slowly. Hostel 2 also follows 2 American men who, on the flip side of the coin, are willing to pay to join an exclusive club where a life will end at their hands...any way they like.The movie is exactly like ""Hostel,"" except for a twist: They show us the perspective of the torturers (and the victims, of course). What I think is better than the first film is that the characters are much more sympathetic (not to mention smarter), it answered some questions from the first film, and possibly some other minor things.Unfortunately, there are some things in here that is worse than the first film. First of all, Eli Roth thought it would be better to put a more gruesome torture scene, which I found unbearable. Honestly, I think that one scene can turn off viewers and have them leaving within a second. I also found the film is bland. It's comedic and then it's scary and then, in some points of the film, it's ridiculous.This film is, more or less, unrealistic compared to the first. First of all, I find it hard to believe no one in the world knows about this whole business thingy going around. This is treated as if there is a big drug business going that the police can't see. But I guess if the police did find all of this going on, there wouldn't be a movie in the first place.I thought I was looking way too forward for this film, considering how I actually like the first film. This is a decent follow-up and could've been better if there wasn't that one torture scene in there, if it were funnier with more black humor, and some other things that made the first film decent. If you like the first film, you'll probably like the sequel.",Hostel - Part II

69,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Hostel: Part II""- A twisted and subversive black-comedy masquerading under the guise of horror.",8,28 October 2016,"It has been a curious but longstanding tradition in the world of horror for many a franchise to eventually make the turn towards the comedic. Whether it be the result of a frustrated studio trying to re-brand a series, a strong-minded filmmaker trying to explore his stories in a new light or even just an attempt at re-vitalizing waning audience interest by trying something new, the turn from the horrific to the humorous is well-known in this particular genre. Though it has ended up turning out very mixed results, the fact is that often enough, it does work. And work darned well. New classics like ""Evil Dead II"" or self-aware satires like ""Bride of Chucky"" being prime examples of the turn to comedy done very well. And I do believe that among the successes of this trend sits Eli Roth's insane follow-up ""Hostel: Part II."" A sequel that in many ways feels like a bit of parody poking fun at the excessive controversy caused by the original.Subversion and anarchy are the name of the game in this installment, which takes the same structure as the first movie, but constantly and consistently turns it on its head, to the point that by the climactic final reel, you won't even have a clue what to expect anymore. It's a refreshing take on the horror sequel, especially at its time of release, when episodic franchises like the underrated ""Saw"" and lousy re-treading reboots were beginning to take over. It was great fun to see a sequel that had the gall to stand up and say ""No, I am what I am. I'm not going to be more of the same. I'm not going to continue the exact same story. Nor am I going to just repeat what came before.""We follow two parallel and seemingly disconnected story lines this time around, both providing two wonderfully entertaining new perspectives on the structure of the original. The first following a group of female college art-students (Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo, Bijou Phillips), who are vacationing in Europe and are eventually tricked into visiting the infamous ""Hostel"" seen in the last film, where they may very well become its latest victims. At the same time, Stuart (Roger Bart), a meek American man is pressured by his best friend Todd (Richard Burgi) to accompany him to same location where he hopes to take part in the deadly services offered by ""Elite Hunting."" Eventually, these two story lines will come together in a disturbing and darkly hilarious finale of pure mayhem and carnage from which not everyone will escape.Writer/director Eli Roth specializes in extreme and wickedly over- the-top content, and I do think this is among his strongest work. While his more recent films (such as the bizarre ""Green Inferno"") has tended to lean towards the ridiculous and sloppy, here, his style works well to benefit the story he is telling. I can't help but feel that he set out to make this film almost as a joke on the over-reaction audiences had towards the first film. Here, he relishes on twisting and turning the story in virtually every single scene. The most clever aspect of it being in how slavishly it adheres to the structure of the original, leading to a false sense of security as you try to guess what's coming next... only for the rug to be pulled out from under you over and over thanks to the radical new humorous tone and the unexpected twists and twists-on-twists. You think you know the first ""Hostel"" good enough to see what's coming? Think again. The incredibly wicked humor injected into the otherwise dark and dreary sequences adds wonderful new layers to the movie, making it so much fun to behold.The production is absolutely fabulous. In addition to Roth's cool and collected visual storytelling, the cinematography is just spell- binding and gorgeous. From the beautiful views of the Slovokian countryside to the twisted contrast of red blood against stone walls underground in the torture rooms, this is one pretty movie. Nathan Burr's music is classic in every sense, with an old school flair that I just adored. And the set and production design is phenomenal. Just wait till you see some of the ""themed rooms"" on display here. The cast is also a blast and a half. German makes for an instantly likable protagonist. Matarazzo is just adorable. And Roger Bart just steals the show as a self-doubting man who doesn't know whether or not he can go through with actually killing another human being. Fantastic role with great pathos and internal turmoil.As it stands, ""Hostel: Part II"" is a wildly entertaining ride through Hell and a great subversive follow-up to the original. It successfully and skillfully makes that change-up from straight horror to pitch- black comedy with ease. And it's just so much fun to watch thanks to Eli Roth's clever script and top-notch visuals. It may turn off some fans who were hoping for a more traditional follow-up, but for those with an open mind, it's a great time.I give it a very strong 8 out of 10.",Hostel - Part II

Three badly behaving whore-looking gals go to Slovakia, only to be killed in such a gory way that all limits of any bad taste are crossed easily and immediately. This is sick, this is sick and vomiting and really tasteless. All this blood... there is too too much blood, meat, limbs, blood baths, heads on spears, cut off penis, eaten face... just bad, and very gory.

It offers more than the familiar gore and sadism, this story is really thrilling and shockingly violent, a strong exercise in sadism and in sadistic violence (pornographic violence many reviewers said). Too many violence scenes, so many that this gore is even wanton, but the movie makes sense overall, suffering and pain are prepared by scare and tension and Quentin Tarantino's mind and hand are pretty visible. There's not so much left taken away gore and blood but this hardcore horror picture, a genuine and authentic real-world creep show, has also an outspoken message, more than the prequel.",Hostel - Part II
72,IonicBreezeMachine,"A bigger, gorier, dumber sequel to a movie that wasn't that good in the first place.",4,23 March 2021,"Beth, Whitney, and Lorna (Lauren German, Bijou Phillips, and Heather Matarazzo) while on a trip in Rome meet model, Axelle (Vera Jordanova), invites the three to a spa in Slovokia. Once they arrive, one by one the girls start disappearing and are met with the horrifying realization they've fallen prey to the Elite Hunting Club, a murder playground for wealthy psychopaths.The first Hostel, the 2nd feature film of director Eli Roth, was released at the right place at the right time following on the heels of the successes of the first two Saw films, and releasing in the first opening weekend of January where Horror films can make respectable business (White Noise, The Unborn, One Missed Call, etc.) even if they're met with critical derision. The first Hostel film I felt was lacking in the novelty of Roth's debut film Cabin Fever and came off as a rather dull and hollow affair, with some decent atmosphere, above average gore work, and a decent (if abrasive) performance by lead Jay Hernandez. Hostel Part II follows a nearly identical narrative to the first one, but amps itself up to ridiculous levels with a psuedo gothic horror approach in some scenes, overblown sequences that aren't believable, and a misguided approach to the Elite Hunting Club that only works at demystifying the film's central antagonist and sacrifices the fear and paranoia of the first film with scenery chewing overacting.From the get go the movie makes it clear that this isn't a Part II, it's a remake in disguise as a sequel. Hay Hernandez's character Paxton is brought back in the opening now living in seclusion having told no one but his previously unmentioned girlfriend of the Elite Hunting Club, and is very quickly killed off making everything related to the character pointless. Not only do we not find out how the club found him, but we find out despite his escape and telling who knows how many people that the club is operating in the same factory in the exact same Slovak village. Even if I were to buy Paxton's ultimate fate, the fact that the club hasn't relocated is just stupid, they have no reason to believe Paxton didn't tell anyone, and even if they have ""everyone on their"" payroll as Paxton claims, there's still a very real concern that they're murder playground will be found out, it's not like Slovakia is the only country in the world with abandoned buildings and a corrupt easily bought off police force.Massive retcons and plot culdesacs aside, the movie hits all the same beats of the first Hostel. it starts off light hearted with our three leads doing sketches in Rome commenting on the nude models manhood (as you do) and it's basically a more abridged and less in your face version of the gratuitous nudity in the first films 45 minute first act. While I didn't like the first movie's first act, I understood its purpose storywise. Here however, we already know about the Hunting Club and the honeypotting scheme so these scenes are not only still identical in terms of abrasiveness and annoyance, they no longer serve their original purpose of misdirection.The kill sequences and the factory in the original were minimalist with a focus on dim lighting, grungy buildings, and simple methods of kills that made them feel at least somewhat realistic (to a point anyway). The kills in this movie are massively overdone such as the movie's moneyshot where a female Hunting Club client uses a scythe to drain an inverted nude suspended women so she can bathe in her blood. It's a well shot and well constructed scene I guess, but it doesn't feel like it belongs here because not only does it not fit with the dilapidated surroundings, it's reminiscent of a kill sequence from the director's cut of Stay Alive where Elizabeth Bathory does something similar, and that was a supernatural horror film so it had an excuse.The movie isn't without saving graces. Despite the film lazily justifying returing to the Slovak village Roth does at least try to do something different this time around with a village Harvest festival played to nice Wicker Man esque vibes of unease (even if it's somewhat undone by the fact we know what's going on). Roth still exhibits stylish direction (often times at the expense of actual horror), and while lead Lauren German is very bland in the first two thirds of the film she does get to cut loose quite well in a surprisingly good third act that allows her to really cut loose (literally) and plays a nice tribute to Rape and Revenge films like I Spit on Your Grave (which kinda makes me wish this had been a greater chunk of the movie).Hostel Part II is not very good. It suffers from copying the plot beats of the first film whilst simultaneously cutting off the dangling threads to pave the way for a retread. Because we're now several steps ahead of the characters gimmicks reused from the first film no longer pack the same punch. An attempt at building up and revealing details of the Hunting Club backfires by demystifying the film's central villains replacing enigmatic figures with overacting. However Lauren German is quite good in the lead (especially towards the end), and there is somewhat clever use of misdirection involving two hunting Club members we follow as well as a nice homage to Rape and Revenge (albeit very brief). If you liked the first Hostel you'll probably enjoy a few parts of this one, but if your reaction was somewhat more lukewarm this isn't going to change your opinion.",Hostel - Part II
73,jaredmobarak,I'm not that guyHostel: Part II,6,20 June 2007,"The original Hostel was a film that allowed the viewers to sympathize with the victims of an underground Eastern European killing club. With Eli Roth's newest entry into the ""torture porn"" genre, he has subverted his protagonists. Hostel: Part II is very much a film about the killers, the men who have come to Slovakia in order to gain the power and knowledge of having killed another human being. I am a huge fan of the first film and thought that it was both stylish and smart while also bringing suspense and danger to the table. The pacing was great, as we learned who the characters were and created a bond to them once the movie turned dark halfway in. Roth knows that he has lost his element of surprise and as a result he can't hide all his players behind the facades of friendly locals like he did. While this is very freeing in the fact that as viewers we now get to see more behind the scenes dealingsthe people pretending to be on the up and up now get to be shown doing their jobs in acquiring their preyit is also detrimental to the overall package. In order to be kept interested, we need to be given more blood and carnage, (and we dotalk about a literal blood bath), because the exposition is already there.Unfortunately Roth still feels a need to show us the victims as humans. This is a shame because while we get to see them, we find they aren't exactly model citizens. Heather Matarazzo is actually very annoying and you find you can't wait until she is killed and Bijou Phillips is your run of the mill promiscuous party girl who you know will have to get hers in the end. Only Lauren German is allowed to have a shred of decency so that the audience can somewhat relate to her plight. However, like I said before, this is a film about the killers. All the scenes showing us these three American girls are used solely to benefit us by leading into the men who have paid to kill them. So, while the beginning does drag a bit in parts showing things we already know, I guess it works because by showing us how utterly superficial and unintelligent these girls are, we become more interested in the torturers' motives. With that said, though, nothing can redeem the first twenty or so minutes of Jay Hernandez and Jordan Ladd. The scenes are used for one reason and one reason only, to connect us to the first film, (totally unnecessary because there are a ton of subtle easter eggs hidden throughout, like the photo in the mansion of our new Euro-hottie with the two from the previous installment). Not only is this bridge not needed, just the fact that they rehash the first movie makes me feel like a kindergartener, being fed everything by a spoon.I will say, though, that I really walked out of the film with a smile on my face. The performances by our true focal points, Roger Bart and Richard Burgi's torturers, are fantastic. Burgi is manic and hilarious at the same time while he tries to contain his excitement for the blood and Bart is conflicted and truthfully unsure of why he had agreed to come along. It is this indecisiveness that holds the film's suspense together because you never know what his character will do in the end. As a companion piece, Roth has done a bang up job showing the other side of the coin and how broken and scared the murderers are as well. The final actions of these two men come as a surprise and a very successful one at that.I credit Roth for not just redoing his first film with girls, no matter how much I thought he was at the start. Once the film is fleshed out and looked upon closely, you will see how he has changed the players and their motives. While the ending is nice, I don't think it is as crazy as the hype has been saying. The final actions at the hunting club were fresh for this type of movie, but also obvious in the context of the story. I do have to say the final scene is a true joy, though. It is good to see Roth's warped sense of humor from the conclusion of his debut Cabin Fever come through with the ""gum kids"" and a little game of soccer here.",Hostel - Part II
74,MrGKB,"Surprisingly, this one was better than the first...",5,26 August 2009,"...but that sure isn't saying much. Matter of fact, I had to go back and lower my rating of the original just to justify giving this unappealing little film a ""5"". And I think I'm being generous with both of them.At any rate, writer/director Eli Roth is apparently one of Quentin Tarantino's favored golden boys. I'm really not sure why, since his writing doesn't hold a candle to Tarantino's, although his film-making is competent, if not overly inspired. I'd guess Roth makes up for it with boundless enthusiasm and cinema geekness (as evidenced in the various featurettes on the DVD). Okay, whatever floats your boat, Q; guess I'll be finding out a bit more when I catch ""Inglorious Basterds"" and get to watch Roth indulge himself at your behest in front of the camera for more than a few nanoseconds. But so far, I'm not terribly impressed.""Hostel: Part II"" takes the fairly idiotic premise of Roth's first installment (the hyper-rich bidding on the rights to torture and murder various kidnapped young people in Slovakia), and gives it some gender reversal (it's girly-girls this time--how very original!) and a modicum of dark humor coupled with feminist revenge fantasy fulfillment (gee! Roth has seen ""I Spit On Your Grave,"" isn't that special?) None of it works very well, despite some admirable craftsmanship. Milan ""Hostel"" Chadima's lenswork is respectable, though again darkly lit, and the gore effects by good ol' KNB are stickily realistic, even if they're occasionally far enough ""over the top"" that willing suspension of disbelief has quite a struggle to justify itself, and the rest of the film's production values are decent (nice locales, excellent sets, costuming, art design, blah, blah, blah), but it all boils down to the same problem that so many films have: the screenplay.Roth's script is pure Syd Field, no problem there. What he fails to do, however, is offer up characters that anyone has any reason to care about, repeating the major fault of the first installment of his contribution to the ""torture porn"" genre. They're cardboard cut-outs, and fairly stupid to boot, certainly as much as the cyphers in the first film were. Divert a vacation to Slovakia on a whim? Why, sure! Go off on a jaunt with a hulking foreigner you can barely communicate with? Why not? Indulge one's sadistic, murderous impulses in a foreign land without so much as a single safeguard, let alone bodyguard? Oh, okay, makes sense to me. That's just the warm-up, kiddies; I'm not even bothering to parse the nonsensical premise of these films, since it's so inadequately thought out that it's utterly without merit. It's a cowardly riff on ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" with an emphasis on exploiting lower class wealth envy. How quaint, how thoroughly opportunistic and ultimately banal. ""Hostel: Part II"" plays like a low-grade EC Comic (or really, one of its inferior competitors); the influence is made glaringly evident with the ludicrous tag ending.One can only hope there won't be a ""Hostel III,"" but I see that I'm already too late with that sentiment. It appears that the first two planted enough indiscriminate butts in seats to justify yet another entry into the series. Let's see now, who will Roth put on the rack this time? Transvestites? Transgendered people? Dwarfs? Fatties? One can only wonder what Roth might actually have to present that is in any way new or different or--god forbid--interesting. Tell you what, I won't be holding my breath.",Hostel - Part II
75,adamscastlevania2,Gives horror movies a bad name,1,26 September 2014,"(8%) Another chapter of trash from Eli Roth, the man with the mind of a mentally backward 14 year old boy (or a blocked toilet). It's movies like this that makes one wonder if Quentin Tarantino wanted to ruin his own career by even associating himself with this crap, because like the original it is pretty horrible, too horrible in fact for average cinema goers, but for hardened fans of extreme horror this is woefully half- hearted, so what's the point. Roth has upped the ante of the original with a scene involving a scythe that feels like having your face forced into a mass open grave. How it ever got past the censors is a mystery (me thinks a bribe or two?). But one thing he really hasn't manage to sort out is his inability regarding script, as this edition cuts and pastes problems from the first as the characters personalities and morals (or lack of) flip like a spun coin whenever it is convenient, and the extent of the evil organisations power is beyond all likelihood to almost comedic levels. Mainly this is too dumb, uneven, racist, unappealing, and boring to be an entertaining watch, and I'm glad that it failed at the box office.",Hostel - Part II
76,Falconeer,Dawn Wiener gets lynched...,7,20 November 2009,"Thank you Eli Roth for providing the most disturbing image imaginable... How could you do that Dawn Wiener?? Hasn't she been through enough? Seriously, 'Hostel II' technically speaking is a vast improvement over it's predecessor. Suspense is built nicely, the girls, other than Bijou Philip's character, can draw a lot more sympathy than some arrogant frat boys exploiting prostitutes. (But those hookers sure got their revenge, didn't they?) This sick tale takes place in Bratislava, i believe, but I think it was filmed in Czech Republic. (I'm sure the residents are thrilled about that.) Beautiful land, and this time Eli Sloth manages to capture the beauty of the landscape. ""Hostel II"" manages to hit on every fear and uncertainty that Americans tend to feel in a foreign land. And it is accurate, i lived in Eastern Europe for 8 years and saw it daily. This time the girls are convinced to travel to Bratislava, based on a description of a paradise and sauna. Evil, sinister tale of sick people, corrupted by the lack of boundaries that vast amounts of money afford them, they bid on the three hapless girls like they were show dogs up for auction. The females command higher prices than the boys, upwards of $60,000. And the clients get what they pay for. A pretty victim that they can do absolutely anything to, without having to think about consequences. Of course the girls meet with a horrifying fate. The question is, does money really do this to people, corrupt them and make them become jaded? Fascinating stuff. I'm not really a ""gorehound"" and I thought that I would turn this off if it got to be too much. But I found myself fascinated, and unable to look away at the horror unfolding on screen. I did not expect this thing to be so artistically shot, and that makes it somehow more bizarre. The gypsy children really added an extra level of creepiness, and although it is completely irresponsible to show kids with guns pointed in their face and playing with dismembered body parts, this was morbidly fascinating to see. Old Eli obviously has an obsession with the Italian horror of the 1970's, and it shows here, in bright red colors. I must admit, the ""bloodbath"" sequence was one of the finest, and most powerful murder set pieces ever. This guy has come a long way as a director. There will be those that hate this, but there is undeniably a market for this kind of entertainment; there always has been, ever since Ancient Rome. It is fact that whenever a Republican is in office in the US, the films coming out of Hollywood become extreme in this way. Films like ""Hostel"" could be a way to prepare teenage boys for their service in Iraq, making them numb, and even hungry for blood and dismemberment. Pretty disgusting philosophy, but there could be some truth in it. Hostel II is an extreme film in many ways and shouldn't be viewed by young kids. This one is really insane.. It certainly has something, but i don't know how this one got past the MPAA...",Hostel - Part II

Its essentially a misogynistic brutal film that says more about the writer than it does about anything else.Why would you want to make this film and why would you want to contribute this level of anti women brutality to the world? He tries to make it 'ok' by having one of the women 'turn' and become the killer as if that will excuse what's come before it but it doesn't escape the fact that this movie is the ugly bully you want nothing to do with, thinking they're smart and clever but really they're just talentless and ugly. Waste of time and disturbing that money and time is put into this kind of thing. I love horror movies but this movie misses the point of the great horrors. Its just voyeuristic expensive sexist junk.

78,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,A bloody surprise,6,27 March 2009,"Here is the inevitable sequel to the hit ""Hostel."" It starts out much in the same vain with a some scenes that offer a fairly ridiculous portrayal of student travel in Europe. There is a party on a train, people sell drugs, thieves lurk, and most of the students are drunk out of their minds. For anyone who has traveled Europe by rail can see that this is an utterly careless portrayal. Next, there is the steady build-up to as unwary victims are captured and we witness some disturbing bloodbath - literally on the ""bath"" part. However, that is where the excesses of this sequel stop.What happens next is quite a revelation for fans of more serious horror - the movie starts to become a thing of substance! This is somewhat hinted at in a few earlier scenes, but for the second half of the movie characterizations are seriously amped up, and there are several surprising twists that mark this film as a serious improvement over the first one. A key to noticing this is a cameo by Ruggero Deodato, who directed the highly allegorical horror film ""Cannibal Holocaust"" back in early 80s. With this in mind, it is easier to pick out clever doublespeak in the dialog and to understand why the tone of this film relies much less on blunt force shock the way that the first film did. The only downer is that all this happens in the second half of the film. Thus, what ends as a pretty good horror film unfortunately starts as trite. But the second half makes this film worth at least one viewing. --- 6/10BsCDb Classification: 18+ --- brutality, violence/gore",Hostel - Part II
79,mario_c,It is better than the original to me.,7,25 May 2008,"The sequel of HOSTEL, released in 2007 by the same director (Eli Roth), is less suspenseful and gory than the original, but is better in many other points. Globally I think this movie is better structured, explains much better the sub topics of the plot, but most import of all, it doesn't fall in some clichéd scenes the first movie does. It's mainly because of that last characteristic I think HOSTEL II is better than HOSTEL.In the first movie we watch the plot through the victims' eyes, the viewer only knows what they know, and that keeps the mystery and the suspense until the end. Here, we watch both sides. We follow the victims, as in the original movie, but we also see what's happening on the other side, the background of the ""club"", and how it works. I liked that. It certainly cuts the suspense and the mystery of the first movie but it helps the viewer to understand the motivations of those people joining the club (in spite of being impossible, to a ""non disturbed person"", support their side!).Another good feature of this film is that it doesn't need to portray Slovakia as it was from the third world, with cars that nobody uses anymore, police forces that spank citizens without a visible motive, misery and poverty everywhere, or the country of easy and cheap sex, to create an ambiance of Human degradation and the loss of respect for the Human life. Unlike the first movie, which tries to create this image of Human misery from the clichéd idea that all ex-members of the Soviet block are poor countries, full of misery, and which don't respect the Human rights (which is a so clichéd and ""Americanized"" idea!), HOSTEL II describes the degradation of the Human life through luxury, power and money; because it shows us the wealthy and powerful people which are behind that hostel and those chambers of torture. The ""club"" just works like a company, and one with large incomes, I must say! So, generally, I think this movie is less clichéd and much more interesting, even making a sort of social critic, on his own way In addiction I must say I really enjoyed the ending of HOSTEL II! I think it was quite intelligent and original, providing a different but very effective disclosure to this film, and even, in a larger view, to the horror genre! The original movie had an average (and quite disappointing) ending, the ""typical horror flick ending"" we all have seen so many times before Here, it's different, because the victim wins with the aggressor's weapons, showing him she could perfectly be on the other side, as she ends being by the way By other words, the victim turns into the aggressor because she has money and she can cover his offer to kill her! Very nice twist, which shows the center of it all: money! It really was a nice ending, done in a very intelligent and non clichéd way, what, unfortunately, didn't happen in the first film!I scored HOSTEL 6/10, this one I will score 7/10.",Hostel - Part II
80,acidburn-10,Basically a rehash of the first,5,5 October 2009,"To be perfectly honest I found this sequel rather unnecessary and pointless. It's just the same as the first, just this time round it's 3 girls instead of 3 boys and this time round we get to see more of the underground snuff club for the rich people who have a sick and twisted fetish in torturing and killing teens. Which by showing us this, takes all the tension and fear in what the first one had.This movie actually tanked at the box office, while the first one made $47 million, this one didn't even make $20 million, and to be honest it's not hard to see why, It just seems that there was no effort put into this sequel at all with the storyline, it just seemed Eli Roth may concern was making more gore, which okay gore is always a good thing in a slasher movie, but without a good plot effects just don't cut it on it's own. It just seemed the studio just wanted to quickly cash in on the success of the first one by making a pointless sequel. The worst thing about this movie was the climax, It was absolutely stupid and unbelievable and plus we get no insight to the 3 main characters at all so I didn't care about them at all.All in all ""Hostel II"" follows the taboo that sequels are just inferior films, The only thing I liked about this movie was the fact that it was gorier than the first, other than that, this just ain't very good, a lousy plot and rubbish characters, I doubt that they will make another sequel (well unless they go down the straight to DVD route).",Hostel - Part II
81,qormi,Hostile Hostel,9,3 August 2008,"This was a worthy sequel to Hostel. It was a different kind of fright in that you now know the ropes and watch as the unsuspecting victims are drawn into the web. In an interesting departure from the first installment, the clients are given more substance. The use of on line, hand held bidding was a nice touch. Also, the hand-held buzzers similar to those used in restaurants was a creepy touch. The two Amwerican clients were a couple of slimy thirty-something guys. The dominant one talked his friend into getting a second mortgage on his house to go on the trip. We now have a gung-ho,narcissistic dude and a moody follower who just might back out. The three girls acted their parts very well; very believable. It was kind of predictable, though, that the funny-looking one would get the most brutal torture. I have to say that this film was well made had good acting. It kept you riveted for the duration. Not an easy task for a sequel.",Hostel - Part II
82,DonFishies,"A slightly more satisfying sequel, but still not up to par with the likes of Saw",5,2 January 2008,"After a superfluous and inane prologue, Hostel: Part II picks up with three American women studying art in Europe. As they continue their travels, they are coaxed into travelling to Slovakia with promises that anyone watching knows will not be kept. At the same time, their story is paralleled by two American businessmen who travel to Slovakia after winning an auction to kill people in the grim setting introduced in the first film.While I was not expecting much from Hostel: Part II after seeing how atrociously bad the first film was, I actually ended up being pleasantly surprised for the most part with what writer/director Eli Roth has done with the sequel. Instead of making a carbon copy of the first film but switching the genders of the main characters (as I originally assumed was the gimmick), he has actually fine tuned it into more of a story than the first film allowed. Doing away with the pointless fratboy wet-dream gone horribly wrong style of the first film (and getting rid of overly used amount of female nudity), he wisely decided to focus a lot more attention on the actual idea behind the grotesque brutal murders taking place in the hostels. Being the most enjoyable part of the first film, I was quite impressed to see him make such a drastic change for the sequel.Devoting a lot more material to this element of the film also makes the film make a whole lot more sense than the original. Whereas that film felt like many events strung into one incomprehensible narrative, this one runs rather smoothly (even with the two story lines) and flows quite well up until its darkly satisfying ending. Of course, there is quite a bit of slowdown in the middle (as there was in both Hostel and Cabin Fever), but it does not reduce itself down to a simplistic mash-up of genres. Here, even with a whole lot less suspense and horror, it plays itself more as a satire on the idea of the murders and the auctioneers behind them, and has a much better sense of dark comedy behind it. It is a far stronger cohesive whole than I imagined it would be.But in doing a lot more exploring of the mythology behind the killings, Roth again sacrifices his character development. Many of these characters are one-dimensional horror clichés, and others that have some form of growth still end up turning into clichés. None of these characters actually feel strong enough to stand on their own, and much like the original film, really do not offer the audience any reason to care about them. I felt a little more sympathetic than I did for those in Hostel, but I think that is more because the main characters were women who did not just want sex and drugs (although that is still one of their primary objectives it seems). There are no real standout actors here, and sadly none of them seem inclined to really make something of their performances. It was nice to see some returning faces from the original film as well, but sadly, they contribute nothing more than what they did in that film.What is also interesting is in the fact that this movie has very little to offer by way of torture scenes. While the first film had many attempts at gruelling torture and goofy graphic violence, this film has a few graphically bloody scenes (including one bizarre sequence that featured enough blood to fill at least one scene in Peter Jackson's Dead Alive), and not much else. I am uncertain if this disappointed me, but for a movie that aims at the gut for being disgustingly vile in its expression of violence, I think that it is lacking. And much like the first film, Roth fails to push the envelope for horror. He says he loves Ruggero Deodato's work in Cannibal Holocaust (enough to give him a cameo here), but he fails to add him enough content to make it truly shocking and horrific. Yes, I squirmed at one particular scene (for obvious reason), but in a ninety-three minute movie, that is not nearly enough. If the Saw films are continually upping the ante, I think Roth could have done a little bit more to gross people out here (although, I am thankful he did not just throw in his demented sense of humour in here like he carelessly did with the first film).In the end, I just really think that Roth had finally figured out a way to make a decent idea out of his original idea for Hostel, but just did not know how to make it truly work. You can see in almost every scene the caring hand of someone in love with the horror genre (and obvious subcategory of torture porn), but he just needs to learn how to focus his talents a lot more clearly. He has what it takes to be a good satirist, and has quite the unhinged sense of bleakly dark comedy, but he lacks the idealism for merging all of it into a strong whole. The film does hold together fairly well, but it screams of being something better had it been in someone else's hands. Maybe what Roth needs is just more time exploring his writing capabilities, and less time behind the camera. I am certain that someone can work off of an Eli Roth script, and make it truly memorable and enjoyable, and not just somewhat worthwhile. And then maybe I can truly really enjoy a piece of his work, and not just hope that he emerges as a true force in horror in the future.5/10.",Hostel - Part II
83,TalesfromTheCryptfan,An improvement over the first one.,8,30 October 2007,"Three American girls (Bijou Philips, Lauree German and Heather Matarazzo) are on a European vacation in studying art. They aboard a train from Rome to Slovokia where they stay for a while at a local hostel that also has a unique hot-springs spa, while it may seem like a harmless trip there it later turns into a relentless nightmare when they are kidnapped by criminals that like to torture people and kill them for profit but they can escape the horror of it all? While the original was a good but flawed torture horror effort, i found this sequel to be a very big improvement over the original movie. Director-Writer Eli Roth and producer Quentin Tarantino really delivers a sequel that actually delivers more thrills and bloody chills then the original with such cringe-inducing moments of gore like the realistic castration sequence, a young boy being shot, saw blade to the skull etc. and of course decent acting. There are some dark humorous moments such as the surprise twist ending that i can't reveal to you but must be seen to believe, legendary director Ruggero Deoato (director of ""Jungle Holocaust"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust"") does an amusing appearance as a cannibalistic sadist.It's good bloody fun for anyone who likes torture and gore.",Hostel - Part II
84,LoneWolfAndCub,"Beat my extremely low expectations, maybe Roth still has it....",7,24 October 2007,"After seeing Cabin Fever I thought Eli Roth had a talent. A talent to make a movie both incredibly disgusting, chilling and funny (it wasn't flawless, though). Unfortunately, Hostel destroyed that vision for me. Hostel was just average, not scary or funny, just average. It was probably the hype that killed Hostel for me so when I rented this I made sure to have no expectations. I thought this would be a crappy cash-in sequel like most are nowadays and have little to no redeeming value. I was very wrong...In this second outing we start where we left off in the first one. Paxton, a nervous wreck, is having recurring nightmares about his experience in Slovakia. Ten minutes in and his fears were not in vain, as his girlfriend sees his headless body at the kitchen table, a cat perched on top licking his blood. After this I thought, maybe Eli is improved. We are then introduced to three art students: Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips) and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo). They meet Axelle (Vera Jordanova), a beautiful model, who takes them to Slovakia and back to a familiar Hostel with familiar faces. We are also introduced to Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart), two American businessmen who bid for the girls and become members of the underground torture club. When the girls start disappearing one by one it follows the same basic path of the first Hostel.What saves this from being a meager cash-in, though? The addition of Todd and Stuart help create some interesting scenes of how the Elite Hunters work and what type of people actually bid. This addition was very good but lacked depth to make it outstanding. The characters were not exactly original (Beth; smart one, Whitney; slut and Lorna; nerd) but the actors were good enough to make me care about them.Also, this one actually had scenes of sickening torture that made me cringe and look away. THIS IS WHAT I WANT! When Roth promised sick stuff in the first and I didn't get it I was annoyed. But thankfully he somewhat lived up to the promise. One scene in particular was very off and quite foul but hey, if you pay to see a movie about torture, what do you expect? Overall this was a surprisingly decent movie (much better than the first) and there still may be hope that Roth produces a perfect horror movie. As much as I like this movie, it isn't GREAT or GROUNDBREAKING, just a decent horror among hordes of crap.3½/5",Hostel - Part II
85,LazySod,"Slightly less irritating than the first, still no good",4,3 July 2007,"In 2005 Hostel was released. A film that, for me, combined the worst of Eurotrip with the worst of Saw: it was, for the most of it, boring, completely flat and hollow. About 20 minutes of that film was a worthwhile watch. I rated it with a 2 out of 10 for being absolutely irritating.Now, in 2007 the second part is released and the only reason for me to go watch it was the fact that I didn't believe they could do any worse. My assumption was right. They didn't make it worse. They didn't make it much better either. It was slightly less irritating but still a run of the mill overly shallow film with a few worthwhile strips of tape and a lot of boring stuff in between.So much of the same really. Very shallow characters. So many clichés used that cliché-bingo would have seen a winner within the first 15 minutes of the film and more or less a carbon copy of the story. Still, some things were worth a mention: one of the kills is in my eyes -the- most impressive and evil minded kill ever done on film.4 out of 10 sick peoples fantasies",Hostel - Part II
86,MichaelMargetis,"Funnier, Bloodier, More Original and More Enertaining Than the First!",7,21 November 2007,"Eli Roth is quickly becoming one of the most innovative filmmakers working in the horror film industry today. It seems that even though his films aren't the BEST horror films ever made, they really seem to work. One of the reasons 'Hostel 2' seems to work, much like it's predecessor and Roth's disgustingly hilarious debut 'Cabin Fever', is because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Eli Roth may make ""horror"" films but in a way they are 'dark comedies'. Really dark comedies. 'Hostel 2' may have made most people cringe and squeal to an immeasurable extent, but it made me demoniacally chuckle more than anything else. 'Hostel 2' is one of the best horror films in recent years.Picking up days after where the first one left off, we get to meet Paxton again (Jay Herandez). After he gets written off (SPOILER ALERT -- he gets his f__cking head ripped off), we follow a group of three more ditsy young girls back-packing through Europe played by Lauren German, Bijou Philips and Welcome to the Dollhouse's Heather Matarazzo. We also get to meet a pair of two businessmen who are equally easy to relate to as the girls are -- played by Richard Burgi and Tony-Nominated actor Roger Bart (The Producers, The Stepford Wives). The two businessmen however aren't vulnerable victims, but the torturers themselves who high-tailed it to Slovakia after winning an E-bay like bid on who gets to torture these virginal young American tourists (well one certainly is not a virgin -- but every horror movie has a ho.) That's about all I'll tell you about 'Hostel 2'. It doesn't really pick up till half an hour until the movie, but once it gets going it's an edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride filled with extremely graphic and morbid violence and gratuitous scenes of sex/nudity. Holla! The movie is basically a deranged little teenage boy's fantasy. The actors are all solid in their roles -- the stand-out is Roger Bart who plays his role which is complicated to say the least to utter perfection. 'Hostel 2' might not be the best movie horror film ever made, it's probably not even as good as the recent '28 Weeks Later...', but it's important to me because it restores my faith that modern horror movies can still be innovative.

88,Ali_John_Catterall,Not worth the repeat check-in,3,28 October 2009,"Should Eli Roth ever be kidnapped by some Iraqi faction and have his head removed live on digicam, he'd probably plead for the film to be exclusively uploaded on a pay-to-view site first. Roth, among a handful of directors, has latterly become associated with the media-created phenomenon known as 'torture porn'. Also known as 'gorno' (gore and porn mixed) or simply, 'gorn' - calling to mind a sword and sorcery action figure or a Swedish death metal group (principal interests, rape and meat), this more-than-averagely explicit sub genre, often featuring naked or near-naked women in extreme degradation and peril, has, if you agree with the witch hunters, taken the jaded youth of the world's developed countries by the scruff and forced their collective heads into an enormous bucket of faeces. 'Foul!' chorus the nation's self-elected moral guardians, huddled over their smouldering blogs. Honestly, you'd think these people had never seen a Ruggero Deodato flick before.It's true, we live in spiritually downlifting times; an era of global and local outrages where you'd imagine you could plead ""Irony, your honour,"" for shooting someone in the face. In an internet age of readily accessed real-life snuff, it's easy to see why the self-described 'Splat Pack' have felt the need to up the stakes, hence torture porn, old horror clothes on expensive coat hangers. Hostel, an original shocker in which a couple of teen backpackers teens are flirty-fished into a world of pain, was intended as a darkly satiric take on commodification culture, American arrogance and ignorance abroad. Whether or not these wider messages have percolated down to the masses is a moot point; sadly, not all of us are blessed with Roth's extraordinary intellect and Voltarian wit. No doubt somewhere in a multiplex in Utah, a girl is wrinkling her nose and going ""Ewww!"", while her bum-fluffed date bounces in his seat and makes noises like a happy donkey. Really, how terribly remiss of them not to read the meta-texts! But it's safe to assume these movies are being made for one reason only: to send their makers laughing all the way to the blood bank. ""This is bull!"" cries one of Hostel: Part II's protagonists, when obliged to turn the tables on her would-be assassin. ""No,"" comes the reply. ""This is business."" And appropriately, our heroine simply buys her way out of danger by wafting her trust fund under the noses of these grubby, cash-hungry European death-peasants.Unhooked from the media circus, and taken on its own terms, Hostel: Part II isn't a total duffer, it's just nowhere near as effective as its predecessor. Here, we meet three American co-eds, latent lesbian Beth, party animal Whitney, and hapless geek Lorna. On past laurels, Roth knows he doesn't have to hurry the hackery this time round, but it takes almost an hour of plodding screen time before they wind up in those carnage chambers. In the interim, Roth fleshes out some backstory - showing Elite Hunters bidding online for the girls, like some deranged version of eBay (eFlay?). We're also introduced to Elite Hunting boss Sasha, along with first-time Hunters Stuart and Todd, jovial, all-American misogynists with wives and kids back home. Subsequently, the action switches between the girls' and the boys' perspective, at times resembling a life-swap reality TV show or horribly misjudged rom-com. (""Meet Beth! She's just dying to meet Stuart!"") Following the film's only real money shot (Welcome To The Dollhouse's Dawn, still being punished even in death), the film quickly loses steam, and the audience its interest. As before, one girl will prove the sole survivor, also illuminating Nietzsche's line about gazing long into the abyss, but it's far too late, and to no great effect. With zero tension, a hackneyed 'scary' score and rubbery-looking prosthetics, it won't sate the horror-nuts, by now used to stronger stuff, or even those looking for some suggested Sapphic relief: it never comes. The audience-as-voyeur thing (see Stuart and Todd) has not only been employed with more panache before - notably in Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer, and in Man Bites Dog, but it's also getting tired. While, as usual, Roth caps everything off with a trademark jokey ending, the equivalent of blaring the 'Merrie Melodies' jingle over a funfair tannoy as you sheepishly clatter out of the ghost train ride. ""That's all folks! No refunds."" Roth's former comment on cultural tourism has also turned back into old-school paranoia, perhaps reflecting fears of a new cold front, another cold war. Too, there's the feeling this has been aimed at a slighter younger crowd: a consequence, possibly, of switching the protagonists' (and in some cases the torturers') genders. Roth is nothing if not an equal opportunities offender. Yet the climactic castration scene is entirely appropriate. Nonetheless, there is one genuinely unsettling moment here, and it's totally bloodless. When Sasha discovers his Fagin's den of urchins have been operating outside his jurisdiction, he strolls slowly among them holding a gun to their heads in turn, a cat toying with a fear-frozen nest of mice. It's at this point you wonder: is Roth playing by any rules? Anything could happen - and then it does. He shoots one of the boys. But it's off camera: all we're witness to is the sound of the revolver singing out and the sudden thump to earth. In Roth's world, you can slice off a teenage girl's face with a chainsaw. You can carve a naked women up (hey, she gotta have no panties, right!) until the blood flows like torrential rain. You can even mutilate a pair of genitals with a pair of shears and fling it to slavering hounds. But you just can't show children being killed on screen. Eli Roth: he's all heart. Anyway, never mind torture porn, what we really want to see is 'tortoise porn'. We gotta help them come out of their shells.",Hostel - Part II
89,nitzanhavoc,Far better made and more impressive than the first!!!,8,16 December 2012,"We all know the rules of Horror films series such as Hostel. The first film makes the rules, then the second one uses the rules to attempt and create something better, greater and more successful - and fails miserably. Not such is the case with Hostel 2. All I've heard about this series is the amount of gore, violence and torture in it. The first film really delivered the ""goods"" (I really dislike gore...), but this film - had just the right amount, and nothing too graphic. Lots of blood in some scenes, but that's all. Hostel part II capitalizes by presenting the viewers with a set up to a very predictable ending, then changes everything completely in an excellent way, just the way fine twists are meant to be. I thought I had it all figured out, and that this film will be as mediocre as I find the first one to be. Then - I was blown away!The acting was in my opinion excellent, every character from the main protagonist and her friends to the insignificant guards portrayed and done just right. Kinda made me feel like the comments bashing at the cast were made by frustrated kids in an attempt to spite. The dialogues, the cinematography, everything was done just right.As for the story and screenplay - for me they were the best part. Taking the rules made by the first film, and twisting them to near perfection. Still, the main conclusion from the first film was delicately kept - the hidden beast and monster inside the seemingly normal people.Criticism? Again, too much blood and gore for my liking, and unnecessary use of nudity and sexual fantasies (especially the sexual tension between Beth and Axelle). I realize it's ""hot"" but such things have no business being in a Horror film, at least not one that respects itself.All in all? Hostel II used the best motives of the first film, with a far better story and twist. So much better than the first one!!! I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys what IMDb users call ""torture porn"" (watch the Unrated if you're really into sick graphic sadism, I didn't), but also to anyone who likes a good twist and a surprising ending. But more than anyone - I'd recommend it to people like me who weren't too impressed with the first film.I haven't been that impressed with such an ending since the Saw series! The first film was nothing but a rules-making prequel to this excellent film!",Hostel - Part II
90,donaldricco,A hostile hostel,6,6 September 2019,"Not as good, or gross, as the first film but a decent sequel none-the-less. And it picks up pretty much where the last one ended, with Paxton! Same set up, same hostel, and same town, although this time there is a creepy harvest festival going on. This movie also sheds a little more light on the business side of it all, but nothing more to be learned about the town itself. And I will say, it was nice to see the Bubble Gum Boys again! I also think I liked the ending to this one a bit more than the first one! But, not enough to see the next one. Still, I won't be checking in to any hostels in the near future, that's for sure!",Hostel - Part II
91,domino1003,It Could Have Been Better,3,9 June 2007,"I had expected better than this from Eli Roth, director of ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Hostel"".""Hostel 2"" has a little more gore in this film than the first one, but that's pretty much all that's going for it. In this film, 3 girls (Lauren German, Bijou Phillips and Heather Matarazzo) are the girls in Europe. What they don't know is that they are the ""entertainment"" for this company called ""Elite Hunting,"" in which wealthy men and women torture, maim and kill the unwitting victims. Two of the visitors (Richard Burghi and Roger Bart)are ready to have some fun with our trio, and it looks like it's going to be pretty nasty.The film is rather heavy on the gore compared to the first one, but some of the storyline seems to fall flat and it drags the film down. The gore seems like an attempt to cover up a slightly weak plot (The art of distraction? GORE!). The violence is pretty nasty (One poor victim is used to give a club member a ""shower""). I had a problem with the ending, which of course sets up for a possible sequel, but just felt stupid.Watch it at your own risk.",Hostel - Part II
92,kirk-246,Eli Roth strikes again.,8,4 November 2009,"It seems to many people that movies like 'Hostel: Part II' are only made to shock and gross out the audience.The movie certainly succeeds at doing that, but there's more than just blood and torture scenes.The only real difference between this movie and the first 'Hostel' is that the travelers who end up getting captured and tortured are females and didn't have males like the first one.That's basically all you need to know because the plot is just as similar as the first.I actually thought that 'Hostel: Part II' was better than the first because it had more twists and the fact that the movie used different sexes made it more interesting.The film was nominated for two razzie awards for worst excuse for a horror film and worst sequel.Why? Sure, it wasn't scary, but it shouldn't be called a bad sequel.I must say that one of the characters in the movie was kinda annoying and unnecessary.Even her name is corny.This character is known as Lorna.She's homesick.She doesn't drink any alcohol.She even has an ugly smile.Thank God that she was the first of the travelers to die.I loved how she was hung upside down and was sliced with a scythe until she started pouring blood on the killer who was laying under her and using her blood as if she were taking a shower with it.Now that is what I call creative.There has been talk of a 'Hostel: Part III', which I will see.The bad thing about it is that it will be a straight-to-DVD movie.Talk about a real buzz kill.Overall verdict:'Hostel: Part II' is among of many underrated sequels that needs to stop being hated and needs to start being enjoyed.I thank you, Eli Roth, for shining new light on Earth and introduced us to something new and original.Something bloody and creative.Something that was good enough to spawn one theatrical sequel that surpasses the original and one direct to DVD sequel.This something is... 'Hostel'.",Hostel - Part II
93,dead47548,A horrible disappointment after a brilliant original.,3,27 October 2007,"As someone who firmly believes that the original Hostel is the best straight-up horror picture in decades, it's pretty safe to say that I was massively disappointed by Part II. It's nothing more than a prime example of what I've deemed 'The Tarantino Effect'. I use this term to describe what happened to Quentin Tarantino back in the early 90s and it applies even better to what's happened to Eli Roth. A surprise hit takes on a cult following (QT's Reservoir Dogs, Roth's Hostel) and achieves massive success, so the director decides to make more money by creating the same exact thing again but they add more hip scenes/dialogue or more gore and outrageous situations thinking the fans will love it. But in doing so they lose their original zest, the element that created a big fan of their first work out of me (this applies only to Roth, since I'm not a fan of any of Tarantino's work). The term certainly has an extra sting when applied to Roth, though, since Quentin was the executive producer on both Hostel and Hostel: Part II.Some call the original Hostel nothing more than 'torture porn', a phrase that the film itself originated and has been used constantly since then (or they just call it Eurotrip with gore). I however, felt it was much more than that. It's a film based in it's characters; Roth added a lot of depth and development to them (primarily Paxton) and gave a huge arch at the end. He made me care for these characters and actually grimace when the horrible tortures were being performed upon them. I wanted them to escape, I wanted them to get vengeance and when Paxton finally exacts his revenge I cheered my head off. For the first time in years I actually reacted strongly to a horror film and found myself completely involved in the story and journey that it's characters took. I heard a quote recently stating that 'Hostel did for backpacking what Jaws did for going to the beach.' Personally, I find that to be true and then some. The fact that I'm a child of the 90s and Jaws was already quite dated probably had a lot to do with it, but I could watch that film a dozen times and be perfectly fine taking a swim in the deep waters. Hostel chilled me to my core. From the creepiness of the citizens to the actually torture/killing company, it ensured that I will never go backpacking in Europe as long as I live.Hostel: Part II completely destroys any kind of love I held for the first one. Roth created exactly what everyone said he was good for; a mere piece of 'torture porn' though it doesn't even deserve that degrading title. It's a pile of utter filth in every sense of the word. I couldn't muster up any kind of concern or sympathy for these characters as I just sat idly by and watched them get tortured and placed in very dangerous situations that I had absolutely no interest in. It comes off as nothing more than a fetish picture of Roth getting his sick twist from seeing what kind of torture scenes he can create to gross out the audience the most and it's simply pathetic. It's an insult to all of those who fell in love with the first one. To those who knew it was more than just 'torture porn' and actually cared for Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and found so much satisfaction when he exacted the revenge that we so desperately needed at the end of the first film.Part II's story actually starts off in a very interesting place. We see what has become of our triumphant escapee from the first feature and the result isn't so pleasant, as you could imagine from escaping a place like that. He's become a paranoid wreck who's constantly waking up screaming from horrific nightmares; we get to see one of these very graphic and haunting dreams as the film's opening scene. Soon it's made clear that he had good reason to be paranoid and with the only interesting segment of the film over, we fly across the globe to see three girls getting ready to take a vacation. I wonder where they'll end up. Quickly, I realized that the best part of Hostel: Part II had come and gone. The first ten minutes picked up the interesting character study of Paxton, but that is quickly ended. Then it's just the typical three girls getting hit on by gross guys, faux-suspense, being hot and flirty and then getting brutally tortured and mutilated. Great job, Roth. You sold out like the rest of them; and I thought what we had was special.I can't say that it's all bad, though. In fact there is a massive amount of entertainment to be gained by the two main murderers in this one. Roth attempted to add some originality to this film by giving us the back story on the people who pay to murder innocent girls for fun. Of course we can't see any kind of foreigners killing innocent girls, so the two men have to be rich Americans. It's alright though because these men provide the only entertaining parts of the film and huge amounts of comic relief. They are played admirably by Roger Bart and Richard Burgi and the two are the perfect match for one another. Burgi is wild, charismatic and frighteningly excited to go and torture some hot young girls while Bart gives the contrast; the shy, reserved guy who goes along with it but deep down believes it to not be such a good idea. Overall the film is nothing special, but watching these two perform is certainly a blissful treat. And the Ruggero Deodato (the director of one of my favorite films, Cannibal Holocaust) is a very nice touch.",Hostel - Part II
94,akshatmahajan,Better than the original,6,26 June 2021,"Hostel 2 is better than the original. I didn't like the original. The only reason I saw this was because of Lauren German (famous for Lucifer). This part was more enjoyable and the story although almost same as first, was more detailed and properly paced.In this part, director's work was better. Not great, but better than the original. Like the original, this part also had problem with the music. Movie like this needs a good background music that helps to create spooky environment but sound team did nothing good to contribute in the movie. The cast and their performance was little bit better than the original cast.Overall, you can give it a try. You may enjoy it especially if you are a slasher fan.",Hostel - Part II
95,krachtm,"Surprisingly tolerable, yet still derivative and not all that shocking for true gorehounds.",5,23 September 2012,"Among mainstream audiences, Eli Roth's Hostel and Hostel 2 have the reputation of being on the extreme end of violent ""torture porn"", akin to the Saw franchise (which tends to hold that distinction in the mainstream horror audience). Extreme gore-hounds, however, tend to be disappointed with mainstream American gore movies because they simply don't cross the line in the sick, twisted, and unrelenting way that some European and Asian movies do. Certainly, compared to Takashi Miike, Eli Roth's movies look like inhibited, PG-13 fare. I can only imagine what these offended reviewers would say if they saw Audition.Movies like Audition, however, are different. What many critics (including George Romero) complain about is that the violence in ""torture porn"" is completely divorced from any context, meaning, or artistic statement. It exists simply for its own sake, to be enjoyed for what it is. This is understandably disturbing to many people, though I find it more distasteful than I do offensive. Some people, such as Stuart Gordon, make the case that ""torture porn"" is an offensive label because people simply don't understand the context of the violence. For example, Gordon contrasted the Bush policy of legal torture and assassination versus the violence in so-called ""torture porn"", providing both context and a layer of social commentary. Whether this layer exists or not is debatable. I respect Stuart Gordon much more than I do Eli Roth, and I'm much more likely to give Gordon's movies the benefit of the doubt, as opposed to Roth's.One of the bigger criticisms of Roth's movies has been his apparent misogyny. I had heard that Hostel 2 was more of the same, which made me reluctant to watch it, but I finally did when there was nothing else on, and I was bored. It wasn't really all that bad, in my opinion. While there were some elements that could uncharitably be interpreted as misogyny, it wasn't nearly as overt as Cabin Fever or Hostel 1. For his part, Roth claims that Hostel 2 is actually feminist, as it empowers the female protagonists. I'm not entirely sure that I buy that interpretation of the movie, but the fact that Roth is even thinking about these sorts of things is an improvement over how women were portrayed in his previous movies, where the women only seemed to come in two varieties: delicate flower or evil temptress. This time, there are shades of gray, which is a definite improvement, but the characters are still kind of frustrating. His characters always seem to end up being stereotypes (the nice guy, the jock, the nerd, the party girl, etc), so criticizing only his female characters might be a little unfair.The plot is a complete rehash of Hostel. The characters were all basically exported from that movie, though some parts were expanded and there are a few small twists. The American businessman, who really impressed me with his freakishly psychopathic worldview, makes a return of a kind. In Hostel 2, he's split into two different characters who provide contrasting personalities: the ultra-macho asshole who's tired of talking and wants to get to the killing and his best friend who's a bit more on the whiny and reluctant side, already having second thoughts about the upcoming murders. I much preferred seeing the story of theses clients instead of the ridiculous soft-core porn build-up of the original Hostel. Also, the owner of the murder club makes an appearance. Though many people were disappointed, I thought this was an interesting direction for the movie to take, and it was one of the few original elements -- perhaps the only one.While derivative, lacking any real characterization, and lacking context for its violence and gore, I still found this movie to be essentially tolerable. Is it saying something about American attitudes and preconceived notions about Eastern Europe? Is it saying something about the idle rich, able to buy themselves out of any negative situation? Is it commenting on Bush's policies, like Stuart Gordon claims? Who knows. Arguments could be made in favor of those statements. However, I think that might be stretching it, and I'm not convinced that this was ever meant to be more than ""torture porn"".",Hostel - Part II
96,buckikris,"The Tables Turn, In This Sequel.",8,13 October 2016,"Hostel 2 Begins where Hostel leaves off, this time the story evolves around three vacationing girls. Beth( Lauren German), Lorna( Heather Matarazzo), and Whitney(Bijou Philips). When they are in Rome, they meet Axella. She is one of the models they sketched during an art class. The 3 girls decide to take a trip to Slovakia, while on the train they meet Axella. She encourages them to go go along with their trip, where she will meet up with them. Once there the 3 of them have no idea what is in store for them. When they check in to the Hostel, Whitney notices Miroslav( Stanislav Lanevski). Beth picks up a advertisement about a harvest festival, every one wants to go except Whitney. When she finds out Miroslav is going she quickly changes her mind. Once there Beth meets Stuart(Roger Bart), who is there with Todd( Richard Burgi). At first they all have a great time, and Axella is very friendly. The 3 girls start to trust her too much, especially when the group is at the spa resort. Once there Beth and Whitney wonder what happened to Lorena? Lorna was the first to victim when she meets Roman the night before. Beth and Whitney think nothing of it at first. When Beth falls asleep at the spa, she discovers all her friends are gone and she is being chased. Once she gets away, Axella finds her in the woods. She takes her back to her house where she meets Sasha. Beth discovers a photo of Axella with this man she meets on a train. Once she finds Axella is not who she appears to be, it's to late. Axelle drugs her and takes her to the factory. When she awakes she meets Stuart, thinking she is saved, but Stuart changes. Stuart unlike Todd gets into the torture thing. He starts to look at Beth like she is his wife. He becomes mean, then Beth finds out what happened to Whitney. Beth does eventually escape and Stuart loses part of his anatomy. It eventually gets eaten by the dog, which in a way was comical.I liked this sequel, because there is more of a plot. It is still a little gruesome; but nothing compared to Hostel. On the ending is is classic. I was shocked by how Stuart flipped out at the end. A great movie with an unexpected twist, recommended.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Hostel - Part II

What they get is a living hell where they are sold to the highest bidder who's wish is to kill them slowly.

98,ExpendableMan,Hostel Part 2,3,7 June 2007,"Eli Roth has learnt a lot of things from his mate Quentin Tarantino, but without a shadow of a doubt, how to talk was the one he learnt best. If you believed everything that came out of the Hostel: Part 2 director's mouth, you'd be under the impression that this was a new lesson in extreme cinema, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen to new and previously unheard of levels. Gore-hounds though will most likely walk out the multiplexes with the same aftertaste that the first Hostel left; it's violent sure, but it's not the harshest, most disturbing film ever made by a long shot. In fact, the only reason you should approach with kid gloves is because this time, it is girls that suffer. Young, nice and pretty girls with much to offer the world and whether or not dismembering them is more shocking than torturing and killing a horny male jock is a matter for feminist academics to debate.The story this time focuses on a trio of art students studying abroad who decide to do some travelling during their holidays. Convinced by a local of the attractions to be had in a Slovakian spa (uh-oh!), tough girl Whitney (Bijou Philips), rich, confident lesbian Beth (Lauren German) and nerdish, murderer-magnet Lorna (Heather Matarazzo) set off for a few relaxing days in the former Soviet block, only to find themselves being splattered all over the walls instead. It's grim and it's nihilistic, but not without a vein of dark humour running throughout (the hell-spawn local brats play football with a severed head), but unlike the first film's bewildered hero Paxton (Jay Hernandez), it's difficult to cheer the protagonists on. Thankfully, we're spared the gratuitous, borderline-pornography of the last film, but the girls are so two-dimensional it's hard to care when their holiday starts to go wrong, Lorna for instance being so sweet, naive and childish that she might as well be a parody.That said though, if you're after more of the same arcing blood sprays and annihilated bodies, Hostel 2 delivers. However, it neither matches nor surpasses the original. Claret still flies of course but in a bit more subdued way and surprisingly, the final act doesn't even come close to matching the frantic, battle for survival that Paxton went through two years ago. Much of the violence takes place off camera, where the audience imagination is set to run wild to the screams of the mutilated but only one scene towards the end is liable to make you wince. Considering the shock-value of the original lay in tendon slicing, fingers being severed, a girl exploding as a train hit her and the eyeball scene, it seems like a step backwards as far as gore is concerned. Instead, Roth goes for a dark psychological approach but woefully mishandles it. The shocking about turns of the plot are more predictable than the director seems to think and what should have been a tense, nail-biting conflict of wits misfires, giving us nothing but loads of shouting and a dramatic, but unbelievable personality shift. Roth may know how to do gore, but characterisations? Forget about it.As a result, Hostel Part 2 is evidence of how far you can go if your self-belief is spectacularly high, but that is all. All talk of this being a doom-laden, intestine shredding nerve-jangler can do nothing to disguise the fact that it apes the masters but doesn't outdo them. Consider how good this would have been if Neil Marshal had directed it for example? Unfortunately, Roth and Tarantino were presumably too busy head-banging to men being torn apart by dogs, girls getting buzz-saws in the face and the gruesome 'Bathory' scene to notice. The Tarantino connection however is rather apt and had this not been a sequel, it could just as easily have gone under a different name and been attached to the Grindhouse project. Don't be surprised if future installments wind up going straight to DVD.",Hostel - Part II
99,Jacques98,The only plot twist was how bad this was compared to the first.,1,2 September 2008,"The original Hostel was insanely better, and here is why: Hostel: Part II is boring. I simply do not understand why directors like Eli Roth honestly think they have to spend 2/3ds of the movie ""characterizing"" when their characters are just flat clichés that you'll forget as soon as you leave the theater. I don't remember their names. At points, they all looked alike to me and I forgot who was whonot that they were different from one another in the first place. The women are all Hollywood clichés: the slutty one (Whitney), the smart one (Beth), and the emotional one (Lorna). I had to look up their names just to type that. Why do we have to sit through a hour of boredom to characterize a cliché that we know by heart? Really, guys, I know a 12-year-old kid who fell asleep watching this movie. Scary, intense, thrilling, gory? I think not.Hostel: Part II is not gory. *Spoilers* The scene with Lorna getting her back cut open and throat slit is what Eli Roth considers the goriest part of the filmand he would be right. BUT, compared to movies like the Saw franchise, this scene would almost be like warm-up for the real nasty stuff. It's tame. The castration scene in the end is almost laughable. The penis is a MAIN blood vessel. But for Eli Roth, and the rest of the toned-down PG-13 horror world, when it's cut off there is only a cartoony squirt of blood and it never bleeds again. Not to mention the scene is so generic and stale considering it a ""finale"" just adds another layer to the stale movie. And these are the only two gore scenes in the movieat all. *End spoilers* And Eli Roth calls other horror films toned down? I've seen plenty of PG-13 movies that disturbed me much more than this bore or uncreative, genetic, inexplicit gore.Back to that 12-year-old kid I said fell asleephis sister later told me that even HE thought the gore was pathetic.Also, where is this ""plot twist that is better than ANYTHING that comes out this year"" that Roth promised? Is he talking about the predictable plot shift that happened in the end? If that's what our society thinks is a plot twist, we all have downs syndrome.But the main reason Hostel: Part II is worse than the first is because it lacks the intelligence the first film had. I fail to see this ""story"" that Hostel: Part II supposedly has, because it's the same exact story as the first one minus the intelligence. The first Hostel was brilliant because it gave the boring scenes in the opening a true purpose, as well as the gore a social commentary that I haven't heard hundreds of times. Hostel: Part II doesn't have that. It has nothing to speak of in the way of an actual story, unlike the first. Listen carefully: do not listen to the reviews stating that this movie has a deeper story than the originalit's not true.In the end, Hostel: Part II has a much better visual style than the original, but not up to par as say Saw IV. The story is more serious, but also more stale and genetic. The gore is above the original movie, but not by much, and certainly not up to the bar set by the Saw franchise.I wanted to love this movie, but without the intelligence of the first film, it's just a generic mess.1/10",Hostel - Part II
100,galileo3,Cinematic trash,1,26 October 2007,"Hostel Part II (2007)Hostel Part II is an even more morally repugnant,more intellectually empty and more misogynistic film.Sadistic violence, very strong language, torture, drugs, nudity and the shooting of a young child, Eli Roth tried everything in this sad and empty film.I thought to myself, if Mel Gibson was accused of Anti-Semitism for stereotyping Jews in 'The Passion Of The Christ', then Roth should be massacred with criticism for his portrayal of Slovaks and Eastern European people. He portrays them as sick, sadistic, backward, ugly, scruffy, perverted; this film is mostly aimed at audiences who can't point Europe on a map of Europe.The funny thing with Hostel Part II, is that the writers actually tried to craft a script with a deeper storyline, dark humour and moral choices and the essence of man and his behaviour. The attempt made this film even more laughable, because it was a ridiculous script that failed on every level.Hostel Part II is boring at times, it tries to develop a story but fails miserably. But this is a darker more perverse and even more sadistic sequel. In some ways it scores as a hardcore horror movie, but as a whole is extremely bad.What modern filmmakers lack, such as Eli Roth, is the ability to absolutely terrify audiences through tension and psychological terrorisation. Look at Kubrick's Shining, Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and even Friedkin's Exorcist; the ultimate masterpieces of terror, the stay in your mind after the film... the old 'less is more' does actually work in horror. Hostel Part II is in no way terrifying or haunting, just a sick perversion made for a narrow minded audience.",Hostel - Part II
101,jerekra,Made The First Hostel Look Good.,2,30 January 2009,"I was not a fan of the First Hostel and to tell you the truth I do not know why I chose to watch the second one. However, when the second Hostel made the first one look good you know that it is bad.The plot is similar to the first one only this time there are three girls instead of three guys.I thought at the very least they were going to show a lot of female nudity since there are three girl main characters. However there was much more nudity in the first Hostel than the second one. So I was disappointed a little that they did not show a lot of hot nude females at least.The gore is just as bad if not worse than the first Hostel. Actually I think it is worse. There is a lot of blood spilled and once again I would like to say that this is not a film for the squirmish. If you found the first Hostel disturbing then you will also find this one disturbing.THe film moves with the same pace basically as the first Hostel but this one seems a lot more humorous. It shows how guys bid on different people to torture and this film shows more closely what the people who purchase people to torture do. Kind of disturbing.Not a good film and makes the first Hostel look good. Not recommended.",Hostel - Part II
102,mistoppi,"Similar to the first one, but still interesting",8,13 April 2016,"While Hostel: Part II is very much alike to the first one, there's one main difference. After the first movie people know what is going on. People know what's going on in Hostel and who is torturing the others and all that. So that's why Hostel: Part II has a chance to explore the people killing more than the previous movie, that tried to keep that a mystery for as long as possible. The second movie introduces us to two possible killers and we follow them as we follow the girls we know are going to experience what the guys in the first movie experienced. And while Hostel films are pure horror, it's interesting to see the two possible killers and their personalities - and see the development in the characters. That shows some true writing skills from Eli Roth.Another thing was that the three main characters were female in this film. This offers a lot more plot devices for the story. Now I was worried that the female characters would be the kind of typical horror movie girls, but something about how they were written reminds me of Death Proof. While the genres are different both Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino have proved they can write very interesting women.Also if the viewer has seen the first Hostel movie, the second one isn't as thrilling, because you already know how the system works. Of course there's still the violence and torture that create the horror, but the thrill is gone because you already know. And while you still may be excited to see if the characters are going to survive, it's too easy. Who survives is following the pattern. But the ""how"" is much more interesting in Hostel: Part II than the first one. Otherwise Hostel: Part II is pretty similar to the first one, and it's hard to not to repeat myself apart from those three key differences that I just pointed out. But the thing is, of course it's similar. I didn't expect it to be different in a major way. Still, Hostel: Part II is just as interesting, even if some of the mystery is gone. While the themes and patterns are similar, there are so many new details that make this one worth watching if you have seen the first Hostel movie.",Hostel - Part II
103,shadowman123,Feels more like a badly made Solvakian Road trip.,6,23 July 2007,"The first Hostel was truly something! The idea of a torture club to satisfy the depraved desire of the rich and elite of the world for a price. It was again just a matter of time before Eli Roth was touched by the curse of the sequel. Hostel Part 2 unfortunately does not live up to its predecessors nor does it it surpass it. The first 10 minutes are promising giving us a recap of the events of the first film with Paxton however from there onwards it just seems to follow the misadventures of 3 American art students in Rome as they make there way to Solvakia and spends too much time firing around all over the place rather than showing what we all came to see - BLOOD AND GUTS ! It does however have quite a few good points like it shows how big the Blood Hound Club is with its connections world wide from America,Europe , India and Japan where members can place a bidding for their victim of choice and also this time it shows the actual 'packages' that are customised for the client i.e. Bathory, Hannibal Lector etc. But we are just given very little insight into that and it spends too much time on our back packers! The story with the 2 American businessmen was good and it the last minutes of the movie stop it from being a complete waste of time although it felt rushed. To conclude I think Eli Roth was trying to do something ambitious with Hostel Part 2, but instead messed it up big time. Although the film had potential it really just seemed like a boring road trip.

The girls go on holiday and become lured, then trapped in the 'Hostel'. Then the disgusting torture porn starts. Everything that happens in this film is again, JUST NOT BELIEVABLE. It is pure imaginary sadism coming from the mind of mentally unwell people who seem to get off on watching others suffer. The scene where the girl hung upside down and is carved and slashed to death by a sicko with a scythe is utterly disgusting and disturbing. The rest is just as terrible. At a lot of points it seems a little dragged out. The end, and revenge angle was justice done etc was enjoyable but entirely predictable, and the same as the first. That's why my comment about this imaginary crud is similar to the first installment. Didn't enjoy this either and those who did need help. I was genuinely surprised they're making a third one...",Hostel - Part II
105,RockPortReview,Hostel 2 - Even better than the Original?,9,3 January 2010,"Hostel: Part 2 11/28/2009The second installment of Eli Roth's Hostel is just as good as the first. Usually your basic horror sequels are far inferior to the original, but Hostel Part 2 keeps up the quality established by the first. This time around we have three American college girls studying abroad in Italy. These girls are played by Lauren German (Beth); she is a smart level headed girl. Heather Matzarazzo is Lorna, the nerdy girl with issues. Although we see in a scene later that Heather is truly a fearless and committed actress up for anything. Finally there is Whitney, the party girl played by who else but Bijou Phillips; an actress who has made a career playing such parts.The story opens right where the first movie leaves off. Paxton has escaped the torture chambers of Elite hunting and is now dealing with some serious insomnia and anxiety issues. Paxton doesn't last too long as his girlfriend finds him in the kitchen minus a head. The cat licking his bloody stump was a nice touch. We first find the girls in an outdoor figure study drawing class. The female model (Axelle) takes an interest in Beth's drawing and she gives it to her. On the train to Rome the girls meet up again with Axelle. Whitney tries to score some drugs off a few guys and it ends badly. Axelle tells them about the therapeutic spas of Bratislava and the girls are up for it. They arrive at the infamous hostel. One might say that this movie is just following to same story formula as the first one. It's true except we also get another story line involving two older American guys Todd and Stuart. Todd wants to bring Stuart along with him to where else Bratislava for an experience they won't soon forget. Todd ""buys"" the chance to kill Whitney and Beth (for Stuart) in a scene where the three girls are auctioned off by their passport photos supplied by the hostel. Stuart is a family man who is always having second thoughts about what they are getting into, while Todd is the super macho extreme freak. We also get to see a more in depth look at the inner workings of Elite Hunting. Every client must get a blood hound tattoo (the company logo). They are given a pager, exactly like the ones you get at a restaurant, and told to wait until their girl is ready.The girls attend the local harvest festival where Lorna meets a prince charming with a pony tail. She is eventually lured away from the festivities for a moon lit boat ride despite Beth pleading for her not to leave. This of course seals Lorna's fate. She is eventually strung up upside down in scene that is so brutal you can barely watch. A female client ends up bathing in her blood. Nudity and bloody violence in one scene is very conflicting. Stuart gets a little to close when scoping out Beth at the festival. They have an awkward meeting, which sets up a big scene at the end of the movie. Hostel 2 seems to have less gore than the first film but it is definitely a case of quality over quantity. Beth tries to keep the group together, but with Lorna now missing, it isn't too long before Whiney, and her new boy toy Miraslav, disappear the next day at the spa. Now all alone at the spa Beth is pursued by a bunch of burly guys' that don't look to friendly. She runs into the woods and into the Bubble Gum Gang from the first movie. She is finally saved by Axelle and brought to a mansion. After getting cleaned up she is double crossed and kidnapped.There is a long montage style scene of Todd and Stuart arriving at the torture facility. They change into butcher like gear, choose their weapons, and try on weird looking masks. Their victims are all kept like cattle, chained in bunches in an enclosed space 'til needed. They are then dressed in clothes and made up to the specifications of the client. When the guys are finally alone with their prey, a big turning point occurs as Todd freaks out when the violence becomes too real. After refusing to finish the kill, he is dealt with severely and winds up as dog food. Stuart on the other hand finally snaps and becomes the real psychopath. He has Beth dressed up as his wife. After a struggle Beth gets the upper hand on poor ole Stuart. When the guards see this on the surveillance monitors they go in to break it up. We then see Beth holding a large pair of scissors over Stuarts ""junk"". Since Beth is uber rich she able to make a deal with the owner of Elite. Stuart then crosses the line by calling Beth a ""cunt"". Not a smart move Stu! She then cuts off his manhood and feeds it to the dogs. Ouch! To fulfill her deal she must get the tattoo and kill someone. With the help of the Bubble Gum gang she lures Axelle into the woods and decapitates her. The gang then play soccer with the severed head all set to joyful music. Roll credits. This is one of the most insanely weird endings I've seen in a while.",Hostel - Part II
106,freaky_dave,Eli Roth is one sick puppy,5,11 June 2007,"But he probably likes being called that. Anyway, here's my review on Hostel 2.I liked the idea of the first because it lent creedence to what people in foreign countries, for the most part, think of Americans. Can't say I blame them, and Hostel proved how ignorant American's can be and how they can be so naive because they think nothing can hurt them if they go in other countries. Much of the way the two Americans acted in that movie is the way some would act for real. I gave Hostel 7 out of 10.Now here comes part two. I would say the acting was somewhat better than the first, but not a big deal. The blonde chick annoyed the heck out of me, but the other two gave pretty good performances. The ignorance of the characters, like in the first film, showed in two of the actresses performances, but the lead actress seemed to have more sense. Still, she got fooled as did the other two.Now the gore factor. I don't think either movie was any gorier, but the gore in this second film disturbed me a whole lot more. I am not surprised that there are really scary people out there that would do some of the horrible things that are done in this movie, but still, the insanity of the torturers seemed more disturbing this time around. Maybe it was the improved special effects, or just the added psychopaths. The first movie had only one truly disturbing individual, but this film had I think four.It seems that by this review I should give Hostel 2 a better rating then the first one, but I can't. Yes this film was more disturbing, but there was nothing new added. The only changes were that the victims were female instead of male. Nothing else stood out. It was just more of the same. Yes we get the point of view of the killers this time around, but it really didn't add any new dimension to the story. In fact Hostel 2 would fit in perfectly with the many lame sequels to all the Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween sequels from the 80s. However, since the film is more disturbing then the first, I would say Eli Roth did exactly what he intended, and I guess I have to give it some points even though I still cannot recommend it.",Hostel - Part II
107,axlrhodes,"No fun,an unsettling experience with a silly and childish finale",5,7 May 2008,"For a while films of this type have been stamped with the ""Gorno"" label a little too easily for my liking.This film however,crossed the line.I enjoyed the first Hostel film partly thanks to its ending but Hostel II is a truly pornographic horror.The scene in which a girl is killed by the woman with the scythe was just going a bit too far for my liking and i felt uncomfortable watching it..The film also took a silly turn towards the end and i really got the feeling that director Eli Roth had run out of ideas and was just winging this one.The production values are there but in all,id say Hostel II was a let down and i think Roth should go back to the drawing board as a film maker and come up with something that is more than just a retread of his own shock tactics. 5/10",Hostel - Part II
108,seawalker,A mixed bag of a film,5,1 July 2007,"""Hostel: Part II"" is very much a mixed bag of a film.The pros.To his credit Eli Roth has definitely tried to expand upon the simple formula of the first film. i.e. Young and attractive people, travelling across Eastern Europe, are kidnapped and tortured by rich people, paying for the pleasure of doing so.You see what happened to the survivor of the first film. You get to see much more of the organisation behind the operation and how victims are matched up with clients. You get to know two of the clients (go-getter, alpha male Todd and quieter, more insecure Stuart), up close and personal. You get to see Heather Matarazzo sans clothes and her extremely kinky demise. (Well, I thought it was kinky, and there was a nice nod there to legend of the Countess Erzsébet Báthory, as well.) The most annoying people in the cast get their just desserts (hurrah!), even if it is a well worn cliché. I liked Todd's freak out when he finally gets to hurt somebody, if only by accident, and the dark humour of the devil kids football match at the end.The cons.Sorry, but ""Hostel: Part II"" just ain't scary. It's also kind of boring for long stretches. The film never manages to get beyond the cliché of suspicious, seedy looking European men, even when two of the girls get off with them. There is no tension to speak off and certainly no jump-out-your-seat moments. ""Hostel: Part II"" probably isn't gory enough, either, to satisfy the gore hounds. Yes there are bloody and stained implements lurking in the dark, and dark and damp cells with chains, but I counted only one major murder on camera and one extremely gross mutilation, along with a couple of other bits not lingered on. Is that enough for a supposed cutting edge horror film? I don't know if it is.""Hostel: Part II"" was OK, but that was about it.",Hostel - Part II
109,DustinRahksi,"Better than the first, but that isn't saying much.",5,3 January 2013,"The first Hostel was pretty much half porn and half torture porn, a complete mess and disappointment. This film cuts back on the sex, by replacing it with sexual violence, how about you just cut back on the nudity in general. Eli Roth is and always will be a sick (bastErd). The characters were nothing new, and pretty dumb. I like how this film has a guy question his morales about going through with the torture, it's trying to be serious, but the film is exploitation with a capitol E. Paxton returned, but only for a couple of minutes, which seemed pointless. And I guess Roth thought he would try to differ the generic characters by throwing some lesbian undertones, but it is just there because he is sleazy. Coming into this film I had a good idea with the tones, unlike the first one that left me wondering if the film was just a joke, in truth these films are jokes and not meant to be taken seriously. If you like watching nude women hanging from the ceiling getting slowly cut open, so another women can bath in her blood, you will like it. This film is sick and twisted, but what did you expect, look at his other films. Not the worst film I have ever seen, if you are looking for films like this, stick with the saw franchise. But why would you be looking for films like this? ask yourself that.",Hostel - Part II
110,lagriff05,I'm not laughing.,1,4 October 2007,"Eli Roth has never been a top class director, but Cabin Fever and Hostel were fairly decent/good films for the average horror fan, packing buckets of gore and even streaks of comedy into some racy, gritty, mindless fun that at least kept me entertained. No more, though, as this is complete and total swill. There's no more suspense and no more good comedic flair to be found. No more good gore and no more ""fun"" at all. To put it bluntly, Mr. Roth has defecated on any semblance of dignity his career might've had, and tap-danced on the remains until nothing was left but dust and a rather unpleasant odor. Hostel: Part II just might be the worst movie this year; a complete and total failure in every sense of the word.There's not one specific fault I can point out here - everything is just done completely wrong. From the stupid, unnecessary opening to the fake blood and gore, the out-of-place soundtrack popping up at the worst moments possible, the terrible acting and the script, which somehow manages to be even worse, and of course, the ending - which is unspeakably awful in every sense of the word, in every language in the whole wide world. Roth obviously doesn't care about his own movies anymore, and it's pretty safe to say we can just write him off as a horror director now and forever after this, which can be seen as the first chapter of ""how to screw up in the movie business - Eli Roth style."" We can expect more installments in this gripping saga as Roth descends further and further into idiotic self parody and amateurish gibbering, but I'll just take the safe route and jump off here. There's no redeeming a career after this. Just never see Hostel: Part II. Ever.",Hostel - Part II
111,kevin_crighton,a better movie than the original (plot details revealed),6,30 June 2007,"The first Hostel movie had a good premise but I've always felt the idea was mis-handled by Eli Roth. Hostel Part II is a step-up from the original, but still has some faults.After revealing the fate of Paxton, the survivor of the original, this one follows some students who end up at a spa retreat, that the Elite Hunting organization uses to lure victims to their grip. The difference between this and the original is that the first had male victims, this one has female ones.The actresses - Lauren German, Bijou Phillips, Heather Matarazzo - do okay, playing basically clichéd characters, the nerd (Matarzzo), the sexy one (Phillips) and the nice one (German). But because their part of the story is similar to the original it feels like a simple re-run.The better half of the story, is about 2 Americans (Roger Bart & Richard Burgi) who have arrived to carry out their killings. Seeing this side of the story is much better and has more depth to it, than following the fate of the girls to be victims. The way the Bart character turns from a happily married man into a wannabe sadist is well handled and is probably the most developed character in either Hostel movie. The scenes of the people bidding on the victims to be is well handled as is the scenes inside the organization, revealing the way it seems to stretch round the world.Because the victims are female this time, there is a sexual aspect to the suffering they go through, especially the Matarzzo character. However unlike the original there is a suggestion Eli Roth has held back a little on the violence on his victims. Only Lorna (Matarzzo) actually dies on screen, in a scene which is quite graphic and possibly sadistic, but for the others who die, it happens either of screen, or you only see a suggestion or the aftermath of their fate.The ending of the movie is actually interesting, but at the same time frustrating. The suggestion that the victim can buy their freedom if they have enough money, and are prepared to kill is a good one, but when Beth (German) does this at the end, you get the impression something is missing. I'm not sure if something was edited out, or if this is the case of bad writing. Another detail not giving in the movie, is how these would-be killers are contacted to become members of Elite Hunting, but perhaps there is to be a 3rd movie that will reveal these parts of the story. There a some scenes in the movie that are mishandled however. Beth being chased through the woods from the spa seems lifted from a different horror movie altogether. As is the torture of Lorna. It's more a scene from a movie about the Spanish Inquisition than a modern horror movie.Despite this however it's not that bad in truth.Recently I've become despondent about the state of modern horror movies. I still think they rely to much on bloody violence than trying to scare people. This movie may not have enough in it to restore my faith in modern horror movies,but it's certainly a step-up from some we've seen recently.",Hostel - Part II

114,Zombified_660,"Could've been a clever progression, but feels rushed and over the top.",5,26 December 2007,"Straight off the bat a few facts about Hostel 2. It's not by any means an awful movie, it's got it's moments. Secondly, it's better put together than an awful lot of the 2 dimensional horror tat it was rubbing shoulders with at the time. I just wanted to state those things before I let loose my misgivings.Firstly...cinema violence...a shudder goes round the room. What happens in Hostel 2 in terms of violence is by turns both shocking and stupid, cleverly thought out and goofily rushed. A few bits of this movie are genuinely disturbing and unlike anything you'll see in any other mainstream movie, be warned. Other bits are dumb and blunt and overly graphic to the point of caricature. Also the horrific things happen nonsensically at the start of the movie, meaning the rest of the film seems unavoidably pedestrian after they're out of the way.Inexcusably rushed film-making is all over the place..certain elements are relied heavily upon but never explained, like the main character going into a rage on hearing the word c**t. Now granted that's a horrible word, but a little more explanation than 'I hate that word' would have elevated that to a possible level of sense and understanding, but as it is it just feels like a dumb joke like 'I don't do guns, they take me to a bad place' in the Rundown. There's annoying little bits like this of undeveloped rough material all over this film, and the whole thing just feels like it's in dire need of a good editor to make a decent story out of it all.The bones of an interesting genre horror are sat in front of us with this movie but there's nothing holding them together. It's not made any better by the fact that after an hour of a couple of girls wandering around Prague and a train of all places, Eli Roth obviously looked at his runtime, screamed '****! I've only got half an hour to wrap this up!' and crammed everything in at the last minute Stephen King style for the most preposterous, hurried and overblown ending I've seen in a long time.I had no idea what to expect of this movie as the idea of a Hostel sequel seemed pointless so I wasn't really planning to watch it or anything, and in hindsight, I don't reckon it's an awful film, it's watchable and entertaining if at times sickeningly violent for the sake of it's own bad-boy image, but it's to incoherent to be anything other than another overblown Hollywood sequel. If you've got 90 minutes spare and want to watch something scary and gruesome, you could do a lot better than this. Sorry guys. Better luck next time.",Hostel - Part II
115,EvLauster,"No thrills or chills in this brutal but weak sequel, another reason to stay at the HOLIDAY INN",5,7 June 2007,"Much like it's predecessor ""Hostel 2"" starts out in Eurpope where three art students are drawn to Slovakia, but their trip isn't all just fun in the sun. The girls soon meet their fate when they arrive at the hellacious hostel where people are taken to a remote facility to be tortured and killed by the highest bidder. Roth does a decent job picking up where he left off, sad thing is the first wasn't GOOD! There are no new tricks here and nothing Roth hasn't already attempted before, sure the gore is halfway decent but it fails to capture anything near scary. Truthfully there is no point at all in this crummy sequel the people haven't gotten too much smarter and the gore isn't a tad gorier, and don't even think once about jumping because Eli doesn't even get around to building the gumption to thrill. Not with all the other directions he can go. Overall forgettable, do yourself a favor and rent a classic horror movie where the director attempted at least ONCE to scare. **",Hostel - Part II
116,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Dreary bore fest,5,19 August 2013,"What a boring load of crap. I mostly enjoyed the first film and was quite excited about this second installment, imagining an enhanced horror experience, but I was bored at least 95% of the time.The film wasn't completely awful because of improved production values, some nice cultural scenes, village walks, etc, and that's why I'm giving it a two star rating (not one), but that's all it deserves.I've lost respect for Eli Roth. I quite liked his character in Inglorious Basterds, but my rating of him as a director is rock bottom now.Everything is just so drawn out and boring. Nothing really happens at all, especially if you've seen the first film.The part with the kids in the woods, selecting a single child for assassination was so boring I almost screamed. Pointless, nothing to do with the plot, just a sense of concentration camp menace, this is what corrupt power can really do to you, pointlessly shooting kids in the woods.Forgive my lack of articulateness, I simply wanted to write a dump review for this shoddy film. It had so much potential, some decent acting, pretty girls, but was such a cop out. And don't even mention the ridiculous 'buy-out' of the ending sequence, completely abandoning the exclusivity of the 'hunting club' contract in favour of the given word of the murder victim. Give me a break...Oh, and Mr. Full of Himself, arrogant paying, murdering customer becomes weak-minded and unable to complete his contract, mauled into a bloody, unrecognisable pulp by a couple of German shepherds - what??, while his colleague goes from weakling to super determined, maniac rapist in the blink of an eye... it's just absolute crap.Yep, the feminine fightback thing, and the girls will love this one, but please spare your time/money/dignity by avoiding this terrible film.",Hostel - Part II

Same build up, same sort of people (except much less warm and real-world, awful female stereotypes that could only be written by a geeky male). Same structure, same token 'warm up' tortures.

Then when the girls do arrive they are dispatched very quickly, you know rich people pay a lot of money to do what they like with their prey, its just rushed and bumbled to its conclusion.The two American Businessmen needed more fleshing out as to what compelled them to visit the hostel and kill the girls, OK we know that one had wife issues, but where was the proof other than from his own lips. The other wanted to have that sinister air about him... and? Then the character Lorna Weisenfreund is killed pretty quickly by an unknown woman.

120,simonparker1990,"Two Visits to the Hostel, and hell its better second time!",8,7 June 2007,"Hostel was a very flawed movie, made tolerable by the simple fact the main idea about people paying to torture and kill people was a very good one. It was disturbing, and the brief screen time that storyline occupied the movie made it worthwhile. Overall that film was 7/10 movie at best, it was gory, fun and had a great storyline. Yet its characters and the plot surrounding them was a mess. I didn't care less about a group of American college guys going to have lots of sex. Not only were they irritating as hell, but they also never seemed believable. By the time we saw them start dying in gruesome manners I was practically cheering the killers, it made there irritating mannerisms seem worthwhile as we saw them operated on, beheaded and having half a hand cut off with a chainsaw. I was looking forward to seeing Hostel Part 2 as I was intrigued where Eli Roth would take the story. Would he follow the survivor of the original, or follow a new group of people altogether. The answer is a bit of both, as Paxton does make an appearance, but the major storyline follows a group of girls off to Slovakia to go to a spa. And its with these three lead character Hostel Part 2 succeeds. These three are believable, and actually likable. We have the normal one, the party loving one and also the sweet and considered slightly irritating one. They seem like real people, so by the time the nasty events begin we feel for them. Hostel Part 2 is a rare thing in the horror genre, a sequel that surpasses the original. It might not be as gory in my opinion, but its more horrific, more scary and overall a lot better movie than the original ever was.So let me start off with the cast of the movie, as the cast are surprisingly decent here. As I said the three leads are pretty good, only one who started to grate after a while. We have Lauren German as Beth, she does a great performance here. Its not too showy and it never seems the average dumb idiot girl that's killed off in horror movies. Nor is she the ridiculously kick ass female either, she just seems normal. There's also Heather Matarazzo as Lorna. Now she was my personal favourite of the movie. She's geeky, but she's a genuinely nice person. Her character definitely seems the most believable of the entire movie. The final of the lead girls is Bijou Phillips as Whitney. Now she irritated me at first and after her first few minutes I was waiting anxiously to see her head mounted on a wall and her intestines spilling out everywhere. However her character grew on me, and in the end I found her quite likable, although certainly the least believable. Yet the lead three aren't the best bit of this movie. No what Hostel Part 2 decides to do is show us the killers world, the world of the rich businessmen who auction to kill the people. Its this storyline and the characters that inhabit it that works brilliantly. Roger Bart is the best character and best performer in the movie, I won't spoil anything about his character, he's too good to spoil. He has the best moments in the movie, and I'm glad to see the actor doing more roles. The other supporting cast are pretty great as well, definitely an improvement on the original movie.So what of the gore then, as unfortunately for a lot of people that's what seeing this movie will all be about. Well its hardly gory on the scale of Saw 3 or even Hostel for that matter. So for people going to see this movie foe extreme violence they will probably be a bit disappointed. Only one sequence near the end made me cringe like crazy, the rest seemed pretty tame, although a lot of it still left me disturbed. Especially a sequence involving a scythe and a bath (don't ask). Nothing comes close to sickening like the eye ball sequence in the original, all this does is horrify through other means. This movie rather than opting to sicken, decides to unsettle you. And it does that through clever ways. There are no ""boo"" scares in this movie, you won't jump at all. This works through psychological methods, and a great little touches. The most disturbing and horrifying sequences in the movie follow the actual people who auction to kill the people, its an unusual method to unsettle, but when you see them auctioning at first it creeped me out. Other methods and the actual character inhabiting the world are genuinely frightening, and leaves you a bit nervous. This might not be terrifying for a lot of people, but it is genuinely creepy and a lot more disturbing then the last movie.So what are the faults of this movie as clearly its not a perfect movie (hence the 9/10 and not 10/10). Well if this movie has one fault I'll have to admit its probably the ending, and also the fact some people might complain about the set up a bit, as the set up does take a while. Also the storyline at the start seems a bit superfluous by the end of the movie. Anyway apart from the ending leaving me a bit disappointed and the fact that at least one cast member seemed unnecessary, this is a very good movie, and definitely a superior movie to the original. Whther this does well or not depends on what people are looking for, in terms of gore this won't satisfy the gore hungry fans who've seen Saw 3. But for the people who want a creepy, unsettling and admittedly very well made movie, Hostel Part 2 will not disappoint.",Hostel - Part II

122,Sparrowmaniac,Roth meets Tarantino,7,2 June 2007,"whilst watching Hostel 2, I couldn't but help wonder how much this is similar to a Tarantino movie. True it didn't have the gripping plot which accompanies a Tarantino movie, but the way the violence has been crafted it looked so so similar. Whereas Hostel was just sadistic pleasure to the characters, Part 2 is so much just pure violence. A girl bathing in another friends blood or a group of kids playing soccer with the head of a woman who helped raise them. Or a girl splitting the *bleep* of a man. My God !!! thats so Tarantino.The plot starts off right from where the first movie ends. Again we find a group of kids going to the infamous Slovakian Hostel. this time we have a group of girls (really *pretty* girls) But they don't realize what that is used for. We do find however another side of human emotion. A new side of sadism. A guy fails to do with his captive and another male uses ultimate sadism against his. Its a bit fun, but slasher movies are not my cup of tea.7/10 !!!",Hostel - Part II
123,dudedazzreviews,Exactly the same as the first but with female leads,4,7 October 2010,"Eli Roth comes back with a sequel to the hit horror movie Hostel but is Hostel: Part II better? The story is pretty much the same as the first but this time round, it's three females. If you've seen Hostel then you'll have a strong sense of déjà vu as it's almost no different to the first. The characters lacked personality which was a problem in the first one and you didn't care for any of them, you didn't feel connected. The acting was pretty good and it was nice to see Heather Matarazzo but she was wasted in this movie as her character was mostly quiet and shy unlike her friends. The special effects went all out for the gore in the torture scenes which is no surprise since that is what the first Hostel is famous for and it could make some viewers slightly uncomfortable. The scenes were poorly executed except for the torture scenes which were, just like the first, realistic. Also, the direction from Eli Roth in Hostel: Part II is weaker and the last thirty minutes of the movie felt rushed.People say that horrors like Hostel are true horror masterpieces, I disagree. To me, a perfect horror movie would have to build up to a climax and not rely heavily on blood and gore for cheap thrills. Saw doesn't rely too heavily on gore, it has a story that builds up and the end of the movies always has some kind of trick or catch that you missed. Or there's the horrors that truly make you feel scared like The Shining or The Descent, both have a steady pace and they're both constantly creepy. Or a horror that is unpredictable and breaks the rules of horror movies. Unfortunately Hostel: Part II doesn't do any of the above and it definitely doesn't follow in its predecessor's footsteps.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Hostel - Part II
124,Kashmirgrey,What It Doesn't Borrow It Steals,3,4 June 2007,"Apparently, Director Eli Roth has a fetish for ""snuff."" If fact, in a documentary I watched on the subject recently, Roth is interviewed and becomes visibly ""giddy"" when he comments on the realism of ""Cannibal Holocaust."" It is no small wonder that he developed the idea for, and directed the two Hostel films. I don't see that as an admirable quality, but then... I am old school and still believe the best horror isn't in-your-face-gore. I realize I am in the minority these days.The first ""Hostel"" was not a great film. It was, in fact, not very good, but what it did have was an intriguing premise: a club whose wealthy members pay to torture and murder abducted people. What worked was that such an idea was not entirely inconceivable. I would argue that such clubs, just like ""snuff"" films, currently exist, and that was what made the film interestingly creepy for me.Hostel Part 2, however, offers nothing original. Instead, it robs from various horror films of old. For example, the opening scene mirrors that of Friday The 13th Part 2. In another scene, as I watched a female club-member bathing in the blood of her ""purchase"", I couldn't decide which vampire film the scene reminded me of most, there are so many. It was at the ending that I actually let a laugh slip. The foiled attempt at irony was followed by a scene reminiscent of ""Blood Sucking Freaks"". ""Hostel"" provided solid potential for a redeeming sequel, but instead, ""Hostel Part 2"" ended up being nothing more than a compilation of already tried and over used gimmicks.",Hostel - Part II
125,moimoichan6,Déjà Vu (or how a better sequel could be less enjoyable than the original).,6,9 August 2007,"No doubt that ""Hostel : Part II"" is simply a better movie than the original : the horror/gore/disgusting torture effects are more elaborated, the characters are much developed, the bad guys have finally a face and the all thing is even more credible (the ultimate escape at the end of ""Part I"" was a little bit cliché). But, if you find with a sadistic delectation the rotten atmosphere of this hostel lost in Slovakia, you can't help being disappointed by this sequel, witch is far too much alike to the first one.Nevertheless, it stars really good, as a direct continuation of the first one, just like ""Halloween 2"" happened few minutes after the first one. You even got a surprisingly subversive scene (helas, the only one of the movie), where rich people all over the world bit on the internet (e-bay like), in order to buy the right to torture and to kill three American girls. Some torture and murder scenes are quite enjoyable too (especially the one you can't see, in a Tarantino's style joke), but still, you rapidly get bored in front of such a lack of originality.The first one, without being perfect (it was a little immature), was quite interesting when it confronted sexual-tourism and criminal-tourism by showing that the way this American law students act in Amsterdam is pretty much the same behavior of those rich men in Slovakia, and took the appearance of a moral tale. This one only develops this thematic, by showing how the frontier between victim and executioner is thin, and how money can easily reverse it. The treatment of this thematic is much more mature than in ""Hostel 1"", but it's so predictable that you come to regret the naivety of the first opus. It's a shame that Ellie Roth made two movie from his idea, for if you take the best of the two, he could have made a perfect, original and clever long feature, instead of two disappointing movies.",Hostel - Part II
126,mattressman_pdl,A Good Sequel,9,13 November 2007,"Hostel: Part II picks up immediately after it's predecessor, setting the viewer up for one of the more shocking openings to any recent horror films. The Plot centers around three girls becoming entangled in the same murder-for-profit business everyone learned of in the masterful first film. But that would lead you to believe that it's the same as the first, with a simple gender swap. But it does what any good sequel should attempt to do: build on the original story while pulling out all the stops. Hostel: Part II does exactly that as we fallow two American men about to commit their first murder and three women about to become victims as all death and destruction come full circle in the stunning, brutal climax. The entire cast brings their best to the table and Eli Roth's grotesque, savagely biting sense of humor hasn't lost it's edge one bit, establishing him as one of the new generation's great horror directors.",Hostel - Part II
127,qball_82,Dismally tame second outing,3,2 November 2007,"OK - honestly, why do we watch these films? It's not for the story lines or the wonderful acting. We want blood, guts, gore, and plenty of it. Thrills and spills, scenes that make us cringe and groan out loud, and yeah, have fun while doing it.Hostel 2 has very little of any of that. I would say about 95% of it focuses on the exploits of a trio of girls vacationing in Europe, having fun in art class, chilling out in a spa and folk dancing. Seriously, riveting stuff.There is no menace in Hostel 2, no sinister undertones that made the original fun and compelling to watch. Definitely no shocks or aforementioned thrills and spills. The ending was a semi-neat twist but overall, this was incredibly tame and nowhere near the bar set by its predecessor, let alone the likes of Saw (perhaps what Hostel is most commonly compared to). Perhaps we're just getting de-sensitized but honestly, I was expecting much, much more from Roth. 2 stars for the cinematography, 1 star for the 'effort'.Wait for it on free-to-air.",Hostel - Part II
128,the_rattlesnake25,Hostel 2; Watching this film was torture...,3,27 June 2007,"After Eli Roth's successful 'shock-horror' film 'Hostel', a rolling sequel was inevitable in today's 'franchised' Hollywood, however in 'Hostel 2' all the nastiness and aggression is substituted for out-of-time and disturbingly pathetic 'slapstick comedy-horror' leaving nothing more than a blank canvas splashed with bucket-loads of blood and prosthetic body parts.Roth's aim with both 'Hostel' and 'Hostel 2' was to push the boundaries of exploitative cinema, however the seemingly one-sided characters and incredibly wooden acting coupled with a repetitive plot and a lingering sense of deja vu that 'didn't I see this film last year and it was called Hostel?'. The sense of deja vu comes from the fact that 'Hostel Part 2' is basically a re-release of 'Part 1', but with three girls (Lauren German, Bijou Phillips, and Heather Matarazzo) as the lead characters as they are in Europe studying art and relaxing. Cue, the trusting, yet deviously psychopathic friend (the beautiful Vera Jordanova) to whisk the girls away to beautiful Slovakia, the gruesome hunting grounds of the cold torturers that await. While the film does intertwine the hunted (Lauren German, Bijou Phillips, and Heather Matarazzo) with the hunters (Richard Burgi, Roger Bart), trying to add a new dimension to the characters and installing a sense of humanity in the soul-less sadists, the little time spent with the characters shows little to the viewer a part from the 'dominator and submissive' approach between the two men.While Roth's approach to the 'snuff' and 'violent' aspect of the film, most notably the biggest selling point of the 'Hostel' series, I found myself disturbingly...bored, than anything else with Roth trying to force and create shock, which is seen in a seemingly pointless scene which involves the death of a child, the death itself isn't shown, but for a film like Hostel, trying to force viewers to use there imaginations to involve themselves and create an emotional and shocking connection, when the main focal point of the film is to drive home into the retina's the horror, pain and sadist nature of the tortured and torturers. In comparison to many films released this year; e.g. 'Captivity' starring Elisha Cuthbert, the sadomasochistic violence and misogynistic approach compiles and parades nothing new, as 'snuff' or extreme, unbridled violence and suffering is almost mandatory for most 'horror' films wishing to gain an edge above there competitors by exploiting the exploitation of violence. However there was one scene, which would make most men wince, yet that couldn't make up for a lacklustre second effort from Roth.The rest of the film itself had nothing special about it, a mediocre score added nothing to the suspense or disturbing nature of the film, the 'look' into the 'Hunting Club' itself was short and annoying as it gave little away we already knew and the opening scene itself, seems it was just added by Roth to bump the running time by an extra five minutes. The worst bit of brutality in 'Hostel 2'? The treacherous and severely painful ninety-three minutes running time. Let's just be glad, Eli Roth's agreed not to do a third.3/10 Jordan",Hostel - Part II

In my view the weakest of the two films, and of course the most stomach turning but I handled it well enough. For others, this film may be best avoided if you detest violence or even murder for thrills. A film once again i'll say like many others... would have been better if it was never made in the first place.

There is nothing new in it. There just new newer ways of torture and more outrageous scenes.

Part 2 is almost exactly the same as the first movie, except the three guys are replaced with three women (one is hot off the set of the Princess Diaries), and the gore is so much more gratuitous. There is absolutely no tension or suspense in the movie, mostly because we've seen it all before in the first one. I guess what we're supposed to be scared of is a woman taking a bath in blood and a man getting his penis ripped off. The ""protagonists"" are so boring that I seriously thought that there were only two girls and not four, and the acting is absolutely horrendous. Where the first one had legitimate suspense and a sort of Wes Craven type vibe to it, this one is just... trashy. ""Hostel: Part II"" is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",Hostel - Part II
134,dj_xand325,Despicabally Crap,2,28 October 2007,"""As my father always says, ""nozdrovja"", to your health!"" Thank You Eli Roth for gracing us with another film of pointless softcore porn and bloody violence. This is just Hostel 1 with a bit of plot and a group of women rather then men.Eli your films enchant us with complex stories and mild family fun (not!) The film is about a group of young women who are touring europe but get side tracked by a slovakian woman who takes them to a hotel called 'hostel'. Then pointless torture ensues....Eli stamps a label of ""Presented by Quentin Tarantino"" simply to rake people in and throw them in the keep net of mediocrity. There is nothing Tarantino esq here (sorry QT fans) except for a little pulp fiction reference.I have to admit, this is one of the most disturbing and disgusting films i have ever seen. It goes from Castration to Decapitation. This is the reason i give it 2/10 instead of a 1.Its aim was to disgust and it did! But as a film...it was pure crap If i was rating its bloodiness and disturbance i would give it 11/10 ! In conclusion, Thanks again Eli for a mild and perplexing classic im sure ill be showing to my grandkids some day :). I give this 2/10, a film that you can only watch and be disgusted by with friends",Hostel - Part II
135,Supachewy,An Unworthy Sequel,5,24 August 2010,"The horror film Hostel: Part II is directed by Eli Roth and stars Lauren German and Roger Bart. It takes place in modern day Slovakia and is a sequel to Eli Roth's Hostel.The film starts off with Paxton from the first Hostel sleeping on the train. He brought to a hospital and questioned by the police about what happened to him in the factory. Then the police reveal to him that they work for the people who run the factory operation and stab him in the leg. He suddenly wakes up from this nightmare and is at his girlfriend's grandmother's house. Their relationship is not doing so well because of Paxton's terrible experiences and how Paxton is worried about being killed. Later Paxton is quite gorily murdered and his head is taken to the man who is in charge of the factory. Then it is cut to three girls in Rome taking an art class, Beth, Whitney, and Lorna, and they reveal that they are going to Prague for vacation. The model that the girls were drawing is on the train to Prague and invites them to one of the best spas in the world in Slovakia. That is where the whole torture deal begins. This film is different than the first because it goes into the people who are paying to kill the young kids and not completely the young kids' stories.The screenplay for this film was not very strong. Unlike the first one the characters did not have much depth to them. By the time the torturing started in the first one I cared for the characters while in this one I only really cared about the main girl, Beth, and that was because her performance was pretty decent. Also unlike the first one this film had a lot of unnecessary gore. It did not move the story along it was just there for the reaction. Now I've seen an interview with Eli Roth and he said that his goal was to make the most gory film ever. If he didn't succeed then he came very close. There were many coincidences in this film that I could not accept, and that made this film very unrealistic for me. Overall a poor job on the screenplay, except I did like how the film ended and a certain scene which I will talk about in the next paragraph.The direction of this film by Eli Roth was adequate. He did make many scary, gory moments. Now there is one scene in particular which I just think is one of the best scenes in film I've ever seen, it doesn't even really connect to the plot that well but I just love the raw understanding of it. I don't want to give any spoilers but it is about an hour in and it involves the man who runs the whole operation, a gun, and the group of little kid bandits. Hopefully you know which scene I'm talking about if you've seen it. So overall and adequate job by Eli Roth, I hope the next feature he directs is a better kind of horror or whatever genre film he makes next.The acting in the film was poor. Let me just start off by saying that everyone in the supporting cast was not believable and basically a stock character. Now the lead, Beth, was played by Lauren German and her character was a sweet girl whose mother died which made her rich and it seemed like she recently got out of a serious relationship. She played the part well, I cared for her and she definitely was the only character worth watching. Roger Bart played the part of Stuart who was forced by his friend to come and kill the girls with him. He was basically a stock character as well and I did not care for him at all. A poor performance. Everyone but Lauren German gave poor performances.Overall I gave this film a 5/10. The only reason I don't give it a 4 is due to the scene that I mentioned that I loved and also because the very end with Beth's character arc. I thought every other person's character arc was rather stupid but I liked Beth. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the horror genre.",Hostel - Part II

137,IamtheRegalTreatment,Don't RSVP to Eli Roth's Dinner Party,4,8 June 2007,"Eli Roth's Hostel Part II was a follow up to an already mediocre feature that churned stomaches, but didn't really deliver what the audience wanted. Hostel II made sure it followed up with that same deliverance.This plot was similar to the first movie except that instead of three men going to Europe it was three women. This concept alone tells the audience there will be just as much sex appeal, if not more. Overall, that is what will gross sales. The three women go to Prague and stay at a local hostel that is suggested by a student who they discovered was staying in the same area. All three women are lured into this hotel and are later put up to bid on the hostel network. They stay at the hostel for a few days before being taken to the torturing cells where the women try to fend off the blood-thirsty masochists and save themselves.Eli Roth should really understand that this movie was really unnecessary. I applaud him for his efforts but if the original was not successful, then why bother with a sequel. Maybe he just wanted to go with the times since now-a-days all movies in theatres are sequels anyway. He should move on from this scene and come up with new scripts.As far as the movie in general went: it was sub-par. The torturings were very very gruesome and I enjoyed that part... when there were parts like that (I believe there were three or four total), but the entire movie leading up to it was a waste. Everyone knew it was coming, he should have given the audience what it came to see and not the hour and fifteen minutes of dialogue beforehand. The only scene I wanted to see that I knew I wasn't going to already see was the ending scene with the little kids... come on it was hilarious.4 out of 10 stars. If you want to see tortures, by all means. However, its not worth your money. Save it for Captivity or 30 Days of Night.",Hostel - Part II

139,longcooljolie,For the type of movie it was...,7,12 June 2009,"...Hostel 2 was very good. Both Hostel and Hostel 2 are part of the audacious ""I can't believe someone would make a movie like that.."" extreme horror genre that are twisted but strangely compelling. At least to me. True it isn't ""life affirming"" and ""lacks social importance"" but that isn't what you go to see this kind of a movie for!Hostel 2 was better than the first one, which is a rare feat in sequels. The tagline could be: ""This time it's girls!"" although let's remember that one of the most disturbing scenes from the first one involved an Asian girl.The first problem confronting most sequels is ""how do you open?"" and Hostel 2 cleverly accomplishes this with a taut dream sequence. After that, the characters are introduced: calm, spoiled rich girl, rowdy glam slut, and nerdy intellectual, and the director and writers rachet up the impending tension.Many people have said that it took away from the suspense and horror to see the workings of the organization but watching the girls get bid on heightened the sense of impending doom for me. We get to know the girls from a clever series of vignettes at the art school and then on the train. This time the director wisely avoided using an annoying character like the Icelander from the first film.Hostel 2 contains a much more complicated plot than the first film and it contains some unexpected twists. It contains the most disturbing and graphic extended sequence of either film and it involves the nerdy girl. Incredibly, this is the only truly gory sequence of the movie. Most of the others are quick and even off screen in some cases. To me this shows intelligent restraint: Eli Roth knows that the worst horrors reside in the viewers minds.Of course Hostel 2 is far from perfect: the gang of street kids from the first movie are shoe-horned into this one pointlessly. Although they do figure into the shocking final scene. Otherwise the casting is near-perfect, especially the girls and the two businessmen. The theme for this movie was ""live by the thrill, die by the thrill so in that way it does provide a smidge of social relevance. Highly recommended if you like horror with good acting!",Hostel - Part II
140,Austin_Powers-1,I'd like to check out...,4,31 October 2007,"'Hostel: Part II' continues were the first one ended, and the story goes on as one long story. We follow three female friends on a trip to Rome, when they decide to take a train to Slovakia and ends up at the ""famous"" hostel, which you know for sure you should book in to.'Hostel: Part II' starts out just as perfect as the first one did, and builds up the story nice and slowly to get you in the mood. The last part of the film, we return to power drills, blowing torches and other sick torture instruments. The film has more than one problem: 1. First of all, it is nowhere nearly as dark or creepy as the first one. 2. The club of Elite Hunt is explored so much that all the unpleasant secrets is completely exposed and you don't feel the same creepiness of what to fear. 3. The torture scenes feels fake and lacks suspense (except for the Bathory-scene) 4. The final scene is unsatisfying and not even close to Paxton's revenge in the first film. 5. It hasn't got Eythor Gudjonsson in it. ;-)It starts out so good: the mood is great and the tension gets stronger as it goes along  and then the trademark of the 'Hostel'-franchise is about to begin! A few scenes are strong, but the last twenty minutes feel fake, too ""pop"" and lacks the graphic torture considerably more than the first film did.To be honest, I don't know what to think of 'Hostel: Part II'. Once again I feel that Eli Roth hasn't got the balls to take this film to ""the next level""; either do it with a lot of graphic torture or do it with a lot of emotionally strong moments. The first hour is amazingly made, but the film sadly looses itself after this  It ends up just being a film about moral choices and overdone blood scenes with no emotions getting wakened. The Bathory-inspired torture scene is extremely unpleasant and it made me so upset, because seeing a girl crying while she gets cut up wakens my need to protect, and I found this particular scene very difficult to watch. Sadly this feeling only got to me this one time. I didn't know if I should be upset for seeing girls being tortured or please my blood thirst  Unfortunately the last twenty minutes did neither.",Hostel - Part II

I like gore films like the old Italian Fulci, Argento, and Bava, but this was terrible. I mostly watched this film in fast forward and really could not stand the part where the girl was hung up by her feet and cut with a cycle. I would recommend watching anything other than this movie because this was just not entertainment.

It instead actually gets going fairly quickly, but almost ruins the movie with things like the first murder.

144,stewiefan201,"The atrocious Hostel: Part II is essentially just a rehash of the original, only with women and new death scenes.",3,3 April 2008,"Hostel: Part II involves three young women named Beth (Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips), and the nerdy Lorna (Heather Matarazzo). They are all studying art abroad when they meet a beautiful woman named Axelle (Vera Jordanova), who leads them to Slovakia for a few fun parties. As the three girls are slowly lured in, Lorna goes missing. As they worry over their new acquaintance, we meet two middle aged men named Stuart (Roger Bart) and Todd (Richard Burgi). These two men pay thousands of dollars to the torture facility from the original Hostel, and then proceed to bid on Whitney and Beth against a bunch of other sick-minded people, but the both of them turn out victorious. When Beth and Whitney realize that Axelle has double crossed them, it is already too late. They are both captured and sent to the torture chambers to await Stuart and Todd's arrival. But as the two psychotic men get ready to carry out their vile fantasies, they each begin to have doubts on whether or not they actually really want to do it. But this change of heart angers the people who run the facility, because after all a deal is a deal.As I was watching Hostel: Part II I was actually rather interested in it. The film is very well made with lush production values, and the exquisite locations are excellent as always. But as the sequel dragged on and on I began to realize that everything I'm seeing in Hostel: Part 2 is really just a rehash of the original. Here's what I noticed: Instead of three guys, it's three girls; low character development; a shady person lures them in to Slovakia and the torture facility (ala the dutch businessman from the original); all are killed except for one character, who then has to fight for her survival. Except for the story about the two rich men who pay to torture, there's really nothing new here. The three young women were basic horror movie clichés, as in one is a drunken slut, one is actually intelligent, and the other is a nerd who the other girls despise and make fun of (I'm talking about Lorna). However I actually liked Lorna the best out of the three girls, and it was a shame she had to go first, just like Oli from the first Hostel (Even though he was annoying). The other two girls were just snobby, selfish, and irritating. Lauren German did a fine job here as Beth, it's just that the story gives her nothing good to work with. This movie should have focused completely on Stuart and Todd, who were both not well characterized in the first place, but were very well acted. But they were actually intriguing characters, and Hostel: Part II would have benefited from focusing on the mentality of the villains instead of rehashing the original. The two of them were good up until Stuart's character change in the end, which went way over the top and kind of ludicrous.As for the gore levels Hostel: Part II is far gorier than the first Hostel. There is a scene where a woman lies in a bathtub as she kills someone hanging above her, letting the blood fall all over her so she could bathe in it. Although I must admit this scene was gruesomely creative, it is also completely over the top and to me, for some reason, it does not exactly fit the mood of the story. It makes the movie into too much of a gore fest, and ruined the spirit of the original. There is another scene where Whitney is tied to a chair in what seems to a beauty salon within the facility, and she is pampered by a psychotic employee. I can't put my finger on a name, but this scene definitely rips off countless other horror movie sequences just like it. There is even a scene where a man points a gun at a bunch of mean spirited kids' faces, then he proceeds to shoot a 7 or 8 year old in the head. The mean spirits of this scene are just unbearable, I don't care how rotten the little kids were.Hostel was intelligently creepy because of the way the torture scenes were shot and written, and because it had a few really classic suspenseful scenes. Whereas Hostel: Part II feels more like karaoke, as if the director Eli Roth is trying to retread the first movie's plot, but bringing a few new elements to the table as well. However this sequel turns out to be more into the torture than the plot, and actually sinks to the very bottom of torture porn. The torture was not at all intriguing like in the first, but more grueling and disgusting than anything. Also the ending, while clever, really only made me hate the Lauren German's character Beth even more. I won't give it away but in the end she is no better than the people that run the facility, or the people that kill there. The final of course had to complete the rehashing of the the original Hostel, revealing just how uncreative and unintelligent this sequel really is.Hostel: Part II is ridiculously awful. It fails to do anything but rehash the original's plot, and it does so with little to no taste or any biting suspense. The characters are poorly developed and the story is undercooked. This sequel could have been good, but ultimately fails miserably. I give Hostel: Part II a 1 out of 4. Go watch Hostel instead because at least that movie was original, this is just a depressing little retread. And I hope Eli Rioth gets back on course because he has the budget to make great horror movies, and I don't want to see him sink into generic torture porn.",Hostel - Part II

This provokes different feelings from the audience. After all, girls are more innocent than boys. Frankly, this was all the change that was needed. Eli should have stopped right there. Sadly, he didn't.2) The girls are more 'high class' than the generic tourists of Hostel 1. Alright, I can see why Eli went that way. Like changing boys to girls, it makes for a bigger contrast; upper-class girls being tortured like animals. Brings with it a different feel and fascination. Yet, where the anonymous tourists from hostel 1 were just wondering aimlessly throughout various countries, with no one, including themselves, having a set plan of where they were going, and no one else knowing exactly where they would/should be at any given time, these girls are going to a school, and are not being sent to their doom from a generic location by an unknown friend, but people KNOW where they were last - a school - and KNOW with whom they left - a girl that works there. This seems an unlikely way to recruit victims and it's definitely not a repeatable method to systematically lure victims. Eli is taking away from some of the key factors, plausibility and simplicity, right here. Still, it's acceptable.3) Some of the theme gets hurt. Young, careless boys actively looking for fun and sex themselves, and paying the price for their naivety. These girls are more 'flawless' and talked into it passively. Though again, still acceptable.3) We get a look into the inner workings of the organization. Eli, no! Don't ever do that. It outright kills the mystery, psychology, and confusion. It gives a 'just another day at work for us' feel to the torture, a 'this is how I do my tricks' from the magician. The beast has a name, it's no longer scary, especially with the killers having second thoughts. An amateur mistake à la 'Cube 3'.4) Victims get to participate in the organization as the killer, killers become the victim: a total reversal. This is an extension to the 'inner workings' mistake. Whatever Eli hurt with that plot change, he's outright killing it now. Totally implausible and unreasonable for an organization to kill its own clients - talk about bad advertising - and killing someone rich, high profile, who will be missed, and with a final, huge bank wire leading straight to them. They're supposed to be covert. Same for the woman who lured them there. Not only that, our heroine would then be allowed to walk away, only to face questions from law enforcement to find the whereabouts of her missing dead friends. She would never be allowed to walk away with that information. Let alone she is supposed to hold no grudge against the evil organization, who killed her friends, and all other clients are supposed to have no problem with the organization killing a colleague. Although the audience needs a 'happy ending' with the victim killing off the torturers, Hostel 1 did it brilliantly: The hero finds his 'friend' from Holland hanging around with the hookers during his escape, realizing therefore they all set him up, and runs over them with his car. A very simple, effective, gratifying, and plausible ending - followed by bonus closure with him, scared but bravely, following the actual torturer and stabbing/torturing him in a bathroom. The way Hostel 2 gives this closure borders on ridiculous.5) Bad torturer becomes hesitant, hesitant torturer becomes bad. Another reversal. Not a needed twist, but it entertained somewhat.6) Poor CGI at the end. Why? In all, a poor sequel. After revealing the 'inner workings', it leaves Eli little space to make a third installment. Perhaps for the best.",Hostel - Part II
146,scrapmetal7,Let's put it into perspective.,8,12 June 2007,"HOSTEL 2.What we have here is an enjoyable, artful, and excruciating horror film, that stands up very well, independently of its predecessor.Scare factor: The idea of a hidden, impenetrable, and inescapable place where people pay a lot of money to torture people to death for fun is scary enough. The payoff is when we and the characters actually find ourselves trapped there. At that point there is a kind of evil ""anything goes"" feeling, that we have no control over what happens next, which is guaranteed to be excruciating and awful, and entirely at someone else's whim. For the viewer, this is the intended thrill.Human factor: This is where the movie really shines, and brings something new. Roth asked himself the question, ""We've seen this from the victims' perspective, but what kind of person wants to be the torturer? Who pays the money to go do this? What might they be like?"" Creepy Europeans are easy to make scary, but normal American buddy-buddy types are a little harder. It is the portrayal of a couple average guys who sign up for the fun, and showing their attitudes toward what they are going to do that is fresh and unpredictable, and the real engine that drives the movie.It is from these two aspiring villains that the real surprises come. In particular, the scene where one of them chats up his intended victim at an outdoor festival is startling and very uncomfortable, as much for the audience as it (surprisingly) is for him.Social comment: Another of the film's special scenes shows club members all over the world bidding online on the girls, based on their passport photos. The smiling photos of the girls are made into their advertising and packaging, just as the girls themselves, without their knowledge, have become actual products for sale. This serves as a fairly biting comment in contemporary consumerism and on contemporary news media, where the cable news channels seek out stories of missing or dead beautiful women, package these tragedies, and turn them into their own products and main attractions.SPOILERS BELOW Flaws: Because the above mentioned two aspiring torturers are nervous first-timers, we as the viewers are unfortunately spared having to see things from the perspective of the actual villains. This is interesting on one hand, because they are no more in any actual control over their situations than are the victims (another comment on consumerism), but at the same time, by not showing the perspective of the more experienced monsters or the management, this is a softening of the blow, which is contrary to the point of a HOSTEL movie.The biggest flaw is the climax itself, which defies all logic, and which in just a few short moments knocks the legs out from underneath the entire HOSTEL concept. In a standoff, the ""final girl"" tells the management that she wants to ""buy her way out"". After an entire second's worth of thought, her offer is accepted, on the condition that she kills her torturer, and she walks out the door. This defeats the movie, because the scare factor, the inescapable dungeon full of sadistic, eager torturers, is removed entirely. It is an ""I like your style, kid"", type of scene, complete nonsense given the setting. After all, they were going to torture her to death, and they DID torture her friends to death, and she furthermore knows that the club has murdered scores of others and will continue to do so, yet the big secret snuff society, which hunted the sole survivor of the first film all the way back to America (and carried his head all the way back to Europe) are fine with taking a payoff and letting her live to tell the world, or seek revenge (which she does immediately, by the way).The defining trait of the HOSTEL torturers is that they do not care, and will not take their victims seriously. Their entire reason for being is to get the victims into the cells. For a victim to flash her wallet and get a pass is contradictory to the characters of the villains, as well to the heart of the HOSTEL concept.It is jarring to watch a very well done movie crumble so abruptly at the end, even to the point of canceling out its own set-up. The problem is not that the final girl escapes. If she is to escape, it must be somewhat believable. It certainly cannot be completely unbelievable! After the film, I felt terribly cheated, until I remembered how very well the film had been played prior to the end.",Hostel - Part II
147,antileft,Hostel 2,7,18 September 2007,"The movie is a commendable sequel to the pretty original part 1 , and can be considered one of the better sequels in the movie history . Its basic theme for me is to show why and where so many people disappear , what happens to them , and in this movie , it is nothing nice , on the contrary , they are horribly maimed , tortured and their bodies thrown away as ordinary refuse !( one of the scenes in Hostel 2 is , besides being original , well worthy a marquis De Sade and reminiscent of , well , of Madame Bathory , also known as the blood countess !) . The scenery , actors are also well selected and convincing , i.e. Slovakia.

148,pzct,Better than the Original Actually!,9,14 December 2020,"This was better than the first movie. And why I say that? Because I took some time to think about and talked to myself. But this movie is actually more terrifying than I originally thought. So this movie is about 3 women who goes to Slovak and obviously they get caught up with the same business as the 3 adults in the first movie. But this movie doesn't function as a copy and paste. Here's why:Pros:You can Escape, but It doesn't mean You're safe -
Sekc helped me reach this look. They brought back the main character: Paxton, that survived the last movie. He died in this movie and I originally thought why bring him back? But Sekc helped me realize that this was a message saying
You can escape, but you're still hunted. This was terrifying to me actually. Because it proves in this Hostel universe even if you escape, You can still die at any moment. The fear of being killed was the biggest paranoia of Paxton. And of course, he died by decapitation.The Organization itself - The movie really focuses on the organization that was the main villain in the last movie. The organization known as: The Elite Hunting Club. And what terrifies me is that the organization Is all over the world. It could be an average person that looks like they can do no harm, but they could be part of the group that kills and tortures. It's being paranoid of everyone around you. When you escape the torture, anyone around you could kill you at that moment. That specifically led to Paxton's death. Because he was staying at Stephanie's house. She told her sister, and in the morning
His headless corpse was in the kitchen. You cant trust anybody around you after you escape. You can never escapePaxton's Paranoia - Because the organization was so big, Paxton has such fear that he could be killed at any moment. The beginning sequence was a dream sequence. It may seem unnecessary but it really helps show why Paxton is so terrified. He's scared. He felt like he never truly got away. And it was an appropriate reactionGore - Of course being an sequel, the gore increased. But It didnt really make me uncomfortable. I never thought of any of the Gore scenes to be uncomfortable to me. But it was still good. To the point there was a women who has a Gore fetish. I will applaud that the dogs that killed a client that couldn't kill what he paid for. The gore and the body was destroyed. I was truly impressed by how he looked.Clients - The movie made this clear. It was either directly or indirectly but people can pay to kill the captured. Those clients pay good amount of money to Torture or kill the capture in their own way. But if they fail to do so, they die. I assume this because that's exactly what happened to an client as explained above. They domt care how much you pay. Get the job done or dieThe Victims - While I didnt really care about their story, I still cared about what happened to them. All they wanted to do was party and each of them somewhat was pretty good. Not as good as the 3 in the first movie but I still cared about themEnding - Beth is a women who was a victim. But instead of getting killed, she joined the organization. She became apart of it. And I thought that was a really good way to end the movie. She joined the organization and complete the task by killing an target. So a great ending in my bookCons -Death of Lorna - Her Death was Meh. She was getting slashed in the back by a scythe while the women beneath her bathed in her blood. Another WTF moment for me but honestly, I guess I wasnt really satisfied with her dead. Plus the whole scene was kind of just too weirdNow I can understand if some people dont like this movie but it should be looked as a business stand point. The organization is all over the place and its deadly. Being in their shoes when they escape, it's really terrifying.",Hostel - Part II
149,elizabethbennett,Someone needs psychological help,1,12 January 2009,"Okay, I was bored last night and flipped through the movie channels. Why on this earth I settled on this one is beyond my imagination. But I watched anyway as nothing else was on.This is by far one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. Cutting peoples heads off, blood baths, yielding chain saws in the faces of others? Doing the Lorena Bobbitt thing? Eating people alive? Little kids beating on people with sticks? I understand horror movies are made and exist and know I could have ""changed the channel"". However, this was no horror anything but the work of a sick mind. Who can enjoy something such as this? Whomever brought this together needs therapy and fast. Who wants to watch torture? What does anyone get out of it? What did anyone get out of this whole thing for that matter? Please, those who created this mess, please seek professional help. This is not a horror movie but the work of a sadistic mind.....",Hostel - Part II
150,yfguitarist,Could've been so much better,7,5 June 2007,"My original comment was much more in-depth and focused on all the aspects I was impressed with, was deleted (or maybe I just didn't submit it). So this one will be much shorter and to-the-point.Like the first one, the hype and trailers got me excited. They promised an all-out torture flick, and were nothing like the movie, so naturally, I was disappointed. There's very little on screen torture or gore. I thought the first one was decent enough. Pros:-Roth takes us through the process of joining the Elite Hunting organization. We get to see all sorts of details that he has thought up, from workers going to hotel rooms and stuffing victims' belongings in garbage bags, to auctioning off ""damaged goods"" victims for a discount. The process is explored much more than the first. The first HOSTEL gave us a glimpse of the organization as we tried to escape..this one provides a much more detailed view of the inner workings of Eli's creation -Stuart is the most interesting and complex (albeit unbelievable) character, and his ""macho"" friend was good for a laugh at his expense at how pathetic he is -There is one disturbing scene involving the hanging upside down and scything of an innocent, adorable girl. While watching her cry and wail I questioned myself: ""Why am I watching this? This is cruel and pointless.""Cons:-The steps Elite Hunting takes in securing their victims was very unnecessarily complicated -The comedy (such as the Bubblegum Kids kicking around a severed head while playing soccer) completely ruined the dark mood -Paxton's short appearance and poor explanation -So many pointless, bizarre, unnecessary scenes that only exist to add running time to a pretty much non-existent story -The victim biting someone's nose off with ease, as if it was made of jello...wha?? How? -The teaser promised creativity and gore, just like the first one. The teaser says, ""Americans have no creativity,"" as far as killing people goes, as if saying, ""Our film, however, does!"" But it really doesn't. If you want creative death scenes watch the SAW movies. If you want gore rent DEAD ALIVE or HIGH TENSION.As always, the MPAA is a joke. The only way they could possibly have allowed close-up shots of a penis and testicles being sliced off and tossed to a dog is MONEY (the success of the first HOSTEL). Kudos for Roth for pushing the envelope, I guess...I have mixed feelings as to the whole series. I love horror films, and I know Eli is not the first to utilize this style of pointless torture, but detractors of ""gorn"" (gore-porn) have good points. Eli has created an original, frightening concept that many people are fascinated by. He must be very proud. I think he alternately believes that he is creating something important and groundbreaking (a social commentary), and/or simply is just having a good time grossing people out.",Hostel - Part II

The movie was pretty decent before the ending, because that was just utterly gross and I nearly screamed at the TV because it was horrifying. Overall I give this one a 6 out of 10 because it had some great moments, but some parts were really gross and uncalled for.

154,TheDraytonSawyer,Welcome Back To Hostel!,7,9 June 2007,"Hostel Part II follows right after Hostel part 1, which is a good thing. Paxton managed to escape the crazy torture house and got home free. Not for long though. Then the movie picks up with these girls going on a vacation. One of their friends from art class lures them all to the Hostel. You've got the girl from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (One that kills herself at the beginning) The girl from (Bully) and the nerdy annoying girl that played in (Princess Diaries 1 & 2) Then you've got the two perverts that paid to go to Hostel to kill people. The movie switches sides a few times so you can see what the crazy killers are doing, and what the girls are up to. It started out pretty slow, but got much better later on. There's much less sex this time, which is a good thing. The first Hostel movie had too much sex and less action. In Hostel Part II, you'll see some pretty gory scenes. One involving someone being hung upside down! It's a very dark movie, and has some comedy moments too. There's one part when one of the killer's holds a buzz saw near this girl, then the cord pops out of the wall. The crazy killer kids are back this time too. One of them actually gets killed; I'm surprised they allowed that in a movie. You rarely see any kids get killed in movies. One scene that I found really weird was a scene with a killer eating this guy's leg while listening to Opera music. That was just creepy and disturbing. This movie is definitely better than the first one. It's incredibly graphic and very bloody! There's two very sick scenes near the end, but I won't spoil them. One involves dogs and the other involves a pair of scissors. Hostel: Part II is worth seeing, you'll have to wait a while though for all the action though.I give Hostel: Part II a 7/10",Hostel - Part II
155,DashTheGreat,Weakly scripted Hostel II folds like a house of cards,4,15 November 2007,"Spoilers ahead for Hostel I and II.Hostel II, being a sequel from Hostel I (which was alright), was completely lame. The script was so half-assed that the entire movie collapsed like a building held up by Lincoln logs. Why else did Hostel II bomb so badly? Here's why: The entire idea of a movie about a torturing hell house was interesting in the first one, but was almost pointless in the second one. This is also one of those movies that cause you to say, ""man, this is an incredibly weak script"" while you're watching it. Here's what else I think was wrong with Hostel II.The characters were stock, annoying, and so poorly developed that nobody cared about them. At least in the first one, we wanted the main character to escape, and faced a suspenseful escape sequence. When he ultimately did, the viewer felt a sense of accomplishment. The ending of Hostel II was an unbelievable cop-out that was so lame and lifeless, it ruined the whole movie. Beth suddenly becomes swift and rich, and buys her self out of the torture house? This had to be one of the biggest cop outs I have ever seen, further evidenced by the fact that it was in the last 10 minutes or so of the movie. There was no suspense or anything to it.Also, I almost laughed out loud at how Roger Bart's character became schizophrenic when he transformed into a bad guy; considering that he was having a moral dilemma throughout the film. Then, he gets his hog chopped off, which had to be the comic relief of all of that contrived tension. I also laughed at how bad the bathing in blood thing was. It was disgusting, but not in the least bit interesting.Hostel II was weak, and folded like a house of cards. It was watchable, but I didn't feel like anything happened after I finished the movie. Not to mention that the first part of the film ultimately built up to nothing. It certainly wasn't in the bottom 25% of the movies that I have watched, but it was definitely one of the corniest I've seen.4 / 10",Hostel - Part II
156,knuckles_and_sonic,A toned down but much better Hostel,7,19 February 2008,"I hated Hostel part 1. It disgusted me. Give the guy credit for making such a sick flick. Still i didn't like it. This one however is a different story altogether. Its kinda like Kill Bill 1 and 2. I would never compare this to Kill Bill but in terms of structure its the same sorta thing. The first is violent, the second is more story driven. Thats what part two is like. A lot less violent than part 1 but the sexual kills were still gross. Especially the castration at the end.We get to see things from the torturers point of view and this movie was better for it. I really like getting to know how the whole operation worked instead of seeing people die every 10 mins or so.Some ppl will hate this as its really tolerable in terms of violence but I believe it was a much better movie for it. Still no where near as good as other horrors but a decent effort by Roth.If you liked the first a lot then you probably wont like this as there isn't too much violence. If you hated the first and want to see a more story driven or character driven movie then watch this. Just be prepared for some really bad acting by that ugly girl who gets hung up and slashed.",Hostel - Part II
157,mpurvismattp,"The deuce is loose, let the bloodbath begin!",7,16 October 2015,"It appears that I'm in the minority but I think this was a pretty good answer to the first film (which by the way I also found to be pretty entertaining). We learn a bit more about shadowy syndicate that runs the snuf factory and see that their reach and power mirrors that of the fabled Illuminati or something. This time it's some American girls who are the prey and we are also treated to a few would be killer business men (also American) who believe this ""bonding experience"" will bring them a new found ""power"" or ""killer instinct"" in their professional and personal lives. There are some interesting twists and turns along the way that worked in my opinion, that coupled with plenty of blood and guts, gratuitous violence and interesting yet horrific new ways to turn pretty people into well...ugly ones!

In this case, girls getting their own back on men, well that happens later on in the movie.Hostel: Part II does what Part I didn't: it actually concentrates on gore and horror. Where the first movie shows full frontal nudity of a porn-like nature, part two cuts most of that out and just gives gore fans what they want.What's especially good here is that it doesn't just start a completely different story with brand new characters. It picks up right where the first film left off with Paxton, although it swiftly finishes off in the first 10 minutes and we get introduced to the new characters. Part II follows three female college students who enter a hostel in Slovakia and are effectively bought by external bidders to be tortured and killed, much like in Part !.Realistically, Hostel: Part II is essentially more of the same from Part I apart from this time, it's with women. It's gritty and creepy most of the time and because of the weak and vulnerable stereotype of women in film, you really find yourself being scared and anxious for the girls. Especially Lorna in her death scene. Ouch.Considering this movie didn't make even close to as much as the first, it's a pretty enjoyable torture flick and the ending is far better. I would even dare to say that this is almost as good as the first. Definitely not for the squeamish though.http://ukmore.tk/",Hostel - Part II
159,lionel-libson-1,"So much film, so little to say.",1,10 January 2009,"Direct TV recently ""rewarded"" my patronage with three months of Showtime. I suppose the idea was that I'd be hooked by the excellence of the films.Sorry.A greater waste of film, talent, time and money is hard to imagine. Mindless characters with wooden acting, gratuitous violence--gore for gore's sake--though, judging from some of the comments, torture and dismemberment are spectator sports.But enough grousing. The subject of this comment is Hostel(hostile?) Part 2, a mindless pastiche by someone named Eli Roth, with the assistance, or abetting of Quentin Tarantino. There were no football games last night on TV, so this film came to hand.The female leads, or victims, do their best to dispel any sympathy one might have. In the great tradition of slasher films they are sublimely unconscious of any danger or suggestion of menace.There was the possibility of finding powerful motivation for horror, a la Jerzey Kosinski's autobiographical ""Painted Bird"". Or the film might have referenced De Sade, providing a modicum of philosophy behind the evil. Suggesting that this was all about blood sport for the wealthy is a convenient cop-out, justified, ironically, by the willingness of all concerned with the film to aim for cash by spilling blood.I realize that I've wasted more time nit-picking through garbage, but I had the need to remind your website fans that there is no joy in Slimeville.",Hostel - Part II

161,thebengalimafia-1,A sequel with no purpose.,1,3 February 2008,"This is another one of those rare moments where I actually regret wasting a sheet of paper to take my notes. As the film opens, Jay Hernandez turns in a ridiculously stiff performance. The film picks up where the first film left off. After Paxton (Hernandez) wakes up from his nightmare, he meets his demise in the form of a decapitation. And so our film really begins (for better or worse).Hostel: Part II is director Eli's Roth's follow up to the hugely successful (and thoroughly entertaining) Hostel. The overall premise is the same. A group of American's who are traveling through Europe get lured to the Slovakian hostel. The difference is that this time it's a group of girls. But like before, there is a well placed accomplice of the hostel owners and she convinces them to make the trek out of their way to Slovakia.Apart from not being convinced by Hernandez's performance, I also wasn't completely convinced as to why the girls wanted to go to Slovakia in the first place. They are told its two days worth of train travel out of the way. On top of that, they are drawn into it by the promise of; hold your breath, natural hot springs? So they can bathe? The guys in the first film were lured in with the promise of sex. In the first one, the ""plant"" even says they girls in Slovakia are as desperate as they are beautiful, and all the Slovakian guys are dead from the war, which apparently has been over for 50 years. A group of horny college guys going that far out of their way makes sense since they were promised a ""bangin"" good time after all. But three art students seduced by hot springs? Oh please.The three girls aren't even that convincing, that is together. They seem to be able to work well on their own, but there is no friend-like chemistry between them. I will say this though. Lauren German (who plays Beth) is very talented. She puts in a stellar performance even though the character and the overall screenplay doesn't really give her much to work with. I knew I had seen her somewhere before, and then I realized she was the young hitchhiker from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; the girl who shot herself in the head. I was also fairly entertained by Lorna (Heather Matarazzo). She did a splendid job of being the dopey virgin who can't get through the day without her inhaler.The biggest disappointment comes from the fact that the film isn't even the least bit scary, and isn't that why we go to watch these things? Unlike the first one, there was never a scene where I was squirming in my seat. None of the killings are that terrible. I mean, being hung upside down and having your back sliced is terrible, but there was something about this one that just didn't click. I wasn't remotely scared; heck I didn't even feel bad for two of the girls. I did feel bad for Beth though, it's usually the smartest one that thinks that something is wrong when people start disappearing.To sum it all up, Hostel Part II was barely DVD material let alone big screen. Truth is, the movie isn't even worth a free rental",Hostel - Part II

Otherwise it's pretty much just the same thing, only grosser.There wasn't a single moment in this film that I felt the slightest bit scared. Isn't that what a horror movie is supposed to do, scare you? Instead, all I felt was a sickness from seeing the various ways Eli came up with to torture and kill people.

163,Jacobi1,What A Sick Movie!,1,17 October 2007,"Hostel: Part II (Zero Stars)First of all let me just say that I thought the first Hostel movie was simply boring. To me, everything was bad. But Eli Roth has finally accomplished something that would even make Satan himself twitch with terror. The basic plot of this movie is the same as the first one however with a bigger budget, Roth can now fill up the screen with blood. The basic plot, a bunch of American girls travel to Europe and then get tortured. Just describing the plot makes me feel dirty. With a bigger budget, you'd think that Roth would improve the plot but he doesn't, he just want to make people vomit.I recently watch G4 Icons whose subject was Eli Roth. It's a fascinating episode. There is actually a scene where his friends are defending him. One of his friends said that Cabin Fever, Roth's first movie, wasn't another movie where the plot is just ""gay cowboys eating pudding!"" To be honest, I'd rather watch a movie where Gay Cowboys are eating pudding, at least the writer of that movie put a lot more thought into the plot than Roth has done with his movies. Then a very attractive woman on the episode was defending Roth's movies, criticizing the critics for calling his movies ""Goreography"" or just basically gore for the sake of gore. She continues to say the Roth's movies are deeper than that. How deep though? Having a plot which evolves around people being tortured is not a movie.Roth says he loves horror movies but he doesn't show it. My conclusion is that Roth doesn't care about horror movie nor does he understand horror movies. Let alone, I don't even think he knows how to film a horror movie. Hostel: Part II is a very sick movie!",Hostel - Part II

165,worldpieceprod,"Hostel, sort of....",6,8 June 2007,"The follow-up to the gritty realistic masterpiece that was Hostel takes us back to everyone's favorite Slovakian torture chamber. However, this time around, things look and feel a little different. What made the first film, so creepy for me was the feeling that this could be happening right now. The sequel borderlines on some twisted level of gore fantasy. The bad guys have learned from their mistakes made in the first film and have ramped up their security significantly. It also seems that their clients are far more demented. In the first film, the torture chambers were essentially dirty vaults with drainage holes in the floor. In this film, each torture chamber is an elaborate theatrical set piece. This became a little hard to believe. Also, the characters were far less likable, and the acting was a bit wooden at times. The lack of believability made this sequel, far less frightening to me than its predecessor. The first half of the film was pretty damn boring as well. All in all, once the action picks up, it becomes a pretty fun run. Hostel 2 plays good enough as a horror sequel. Could have been better, could have been worse. The original is one of my favorite films and is a tough act to follow. The first film was a methodical descent from heaven into hell with the redemption of violent revenge. This film just moves from one gory scene to the next with little suspense in between. The gore was plentiful but somehow less brutal and more comical. I did enjoy the film and felt I got my money's worth. I hope they learn from the Saw trilogy and stop at part two, before they ruin the whole franchise for us.",Hostel - Part II
166,samuraifa451,This movie fell apart,3,1 December 2007,"I really enjoyed the first film by Eli Roth and even though I was really not interested in the sequel, I was persuaded by one of my friends to go. I wished I had told him simply ""no"" and stayed home. Hostel Part II is a mess to say the least. To start, according to legend, Eli Roth had an alternate ending to the first Hostel the just beckoned for a sequel. If he had kept the ending, Hostel Part II could've been really good. Instead, we got this piece of trash where the only real plot is a ""Next generation of victims"" plot and most of the scare scenes are just more disgusting than anything else. Sure, it's much more gorier than the first film (and I really wonder how the MPAA delivered this film an R rating), but it's really just all style and no substance. Not too mention, unlike other Eli Roth films this one is meant to be taken pretty seriously, and it's kind of bothersome to watch because of it. Please do yourself a favor and just watch the original if you're a horror fan.",Hostel - Part II
167,Abominog,Welcome back to Hostel,6,7 October 2007,"Hostel is back with slightly better pace, more thrills and exquisite entertainment for wealthy perverts. The stakes are also a way much higher.It takes up impressively where the original left off (nice awakening/decapitated torso scene!); those who didn't see the first Hostel would be briefed on the events and sucked into the business right away.This time we have three stereotypical American girls seeking adventures for their butts: one homely and unpretentious, lacking male attention (and of course the first target of the predators); another - promiscuous, model type chick and tidbit for the freaks; and finally - the one die-hard smart cutie, such as should always be saved for the final act.As opposed to the original, now we acquired the chance to make ourselves familiar with some of the clients (suave and hesitant Stuart and over-enthusiastic Todd) as well as the masterminds behind this sick reality show for the wackos of all kinds from around the globe.Again we have the flock of annoying grubby bubble gum kids (the shooting sequence is somewhat superfluous and unnerving but adds up for the entire awe).There's also some sort of unexpected (against type) character developments thing, which might be amusing and satisfying if hardly believable.The pay-off didn't ring true to me (but it may anticipate another sequel, something in the vein of American Psycho 2 or Hellraiser, perhaps).And in good traditions of the ""horrorhood cooperation"", Roth introduces some delicious gourmet exercises stunningly performed by Ruggero Deodato (yuck!).All-in-all, probably contrary to dominating opinion, I found this second installment of Hostel to be an improvement and watchable even for the wider and general audience, (unless some excessive violence and torture scenes).Did I say it was great? Nope. Watchable? Definitely.",Hostel - Part II

I rented it the day it came out, then watched it. I was bored throughout the whole movie, even during the torture scenes. It wasn't original, too predictable. It just wasn't scary at all. There's a ton of blood and gore, with a poorly written script. It wasn't good. The ending was really weird, and a bit disturbing. The acting was OK, nothing special. I have no idea how it's got a 5.4 rating. Then again this is just my opinion, but I'd stay away from this movie if you're expecting it to be as good as the original. 2/10, Terrible.",Hostel - Part II

I have a pretty open mind and am therefore quite difficult to shock (I guess I'm quite desensitised by now - which I admit is NOT a good thing).Hostel 1 was what I'd consider a ""good"" horror flick with a decent enough story-line, acting and gore (although it did contain some unnecessary sexual content in my opinion), but hey, I guess it is an Eli Roth production, right?! Hostel Part 2... heck, it totally broke the barriers of decency and completely crossed the line, and I'm not even talking in terms of a horror film. It's brutal, depraved, twisted and extremely disturbing. I could not watch some of the scenes in this film. It's seriously sick.This is NOT entertainment in any sense of the word.Quite frankly, I'd be extremely worried if my mind conjured up the sort of thoughts that Eli Roth's obviously does. SERIOUSLY worried.",Hostel - Part II
170,WizardOfGore,"Eli Roth is good, but he's no visionary",7,19 June 2007,"This movie definitely delivers on the gore, and for that, I enjoyed it. However, everyone needs to stop talking about Eli Roth as if he's some sort of horror genius or visionary. Killing people on screen, even in inventive ways, does not make you special.I admire him for having the guts to make his movies his way, without giving in to ""the suits"", but much of the plot of this movie is very derivative. You can see the plot twists coming a mile away, and none of them is very surprising.***SPOILERS AHEAD*** 1-You could figure out all along that the 'killer' who was gung ho for the whole thing would end up wimping out at the end, and that the 'meek' partner would turn out to be the really screwed up one.2-The setup of the rich girl being able to buy her way out of the whole thing was set up way in advance, and was very obvious.3-The ending of the film is very banal.***MAJOR SPOILER BELOW!!**** Instead of having one of the victims track down the women who lured her there and simply cutting her head off, a much more awesome ending would be to have the rich 'victim' take over the whole operation, and have the closing scene be that of the 'lure' stuck in one of the chairs, about to be tortured.All in all, Eli Roth has made three films that I enjoyed, but let's not rush to put him up there with Argento just yet.",Hostel - Part II
171,darlybrito,Hostel: Part Two,9,9 June 2007,"The follow up to last year Hostel has arrived, but with three young college girls. The film wasn't disappointing, the fans were disappointing. I was really surprised when I saw so many negative reviews from horror fans. This flick was well made and it is one of the best horror films in years. It is sad the franchise won't become a trilogy because both films are very entertaining.This time, the film focuses on three American college students Beth(Lauren German), Whitney(Bijou Phillips), and Lorna(Heather Matarazzo) who are studying art in Rome for the summer and plan to go to Plague to explore Europe. However, a model from their art class Axelle(Vera Jordanova) invites them to head to Slovakia so they can relax and enjoy the hot springs. After arriving in Slovakia, the girls find a hostel for the weekend, but everything changes as soon as they stayed in the hostel. Ending up in the famous torturing factory which I define it as HELL.Hostel: Part II was better than Part I, but not way better because Part II had little mistakes. I thought the original film was darker and much more violent than Part Two. What was better in Hostel 2 is the new cast, it was very suspenseful, great storyline, and more security in the torturing place so there is no way you can't escape. I also liked how the killers Stuart(Roger Bart) and Todd(Richard Burgi) face reality in the movie. Their fears on killing innocent people. They both did a great job playing their character.Now, the three girls were spectacular acting their character. Lauren German, who played the hitchhiker in the "" Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake, was outstanding in the movie. Beth was the type of character that parties, but also cares about Whitney and Lorna. Heather Matarazzo plays Lorna, the sweetest character in the flick. She really did a good job playing Lorna because she acted very natural in the film. Now, Bijou Phillips blew my mine away. She plays Whitney, the bad-ass character who didn't stand crap from no body. The cast was a major point in the film and I loved it. Everybody really gave a great performance.In conclusion, this horror sequel is a bloodbath and Eli Roth's best horror film so far. Since Cabin Fever, Roth really improved a lot. I'm really looking forward towards to his film-making career. Hostel: Part II is great, disgusting a well made horror movie. I didn't expect this film to be this good. If you didn't like this movie, I recommend you see 28 Weeks Later.9/10 for Hostel 2",Hostel - Part II
172,akuma634,Another lame over hyped attempt at horror by Eli Roth,2,3 September 2007,"I really never understood all the hype for Eli Roth. Cabin Fever wasn't a very good movie and Hostel was just a total bore. I saw Hostel twice and kept an open mind but it's 90% talk and when someone does die you don't see very much, and what you do see looks incredibly fake. So is Hostel 2 much better? Kind of.So the characters aren't very interesting. Pretty shallow too, there is the main woman who is the better of the group, her slutty drunk of a friend, and the ultra winy friend who you would be tempted to kill too. It's almost like they just want you to see them die because they annoy you so much and give nothing back to redeem themselves. Then you have the people who are paying to kill these people, you get to see them and learn more about the kind of people who would pay over 60 thousand dollars to kill a stranger. But they aren't that interesting and very predictable.There isn't any real tension in the ""will she escape alive"" area of the movie, you already know that if someone is being chased then they will just end up in the killing place. Everything is extremely predictable and they never try to do anything you wouldn't expect. Also the pacing is just as bad as the first Hostel, there is one off screen kill early on and one very bloody yet not particularly gruesome kill in the first hour. Not much happens until near the end of the movie just like part one. The kills are mostly very over the top, it's like the movie tries to take itself so dead serious but they use kills that would look too stupid for a Troma movie.Also like Hostel 1 there is so much build up for the kills and then you don't get much out of it. Lots of really fast movements so you can barely tell what just happened, very hokey effects, unrealistic kills, and very bland torture scenes. Why not at least try and shock the viewer. OK so if someone is going to pay 80% to kill an American woman don't you think he would be sick enough to force himself on her before he kills her? And why is it that in both movies they have really stupid annoying kids that aren't really there for a reason. Why don't they kidnap children and have people pay twice as much to kill little kids? They have the opportunity to shock, offend, and disgust the viewer but they decide to take everything very soft and hype everything up. I wasn't expecting Cannibal Holocaust or anything but at least if you promise to have such a shocking movie style that the media calls ""torture porn"" then at least attempt to back it up. It's like going to a restaurant and seeing the thickest, juiciest, most tender steak you've ever seen so you order it and get a flat McDonald's looking hamburger pattie instead.The movie is just boring and the kills just aren't even shocking. It's like they're hyping it to be like the main stream equivalent to August Underground's Mordum when it's really the most tame horror movie imaginable with the biggest hype and build up that they can buy. It's all sizzle and no steak. Eli Roth just seems like Uwe Boll with more credibility.",Hostel - Part II
173,darkdaxtervc,Ruins the first,1,20 October 2017,"I hated the first Hostel 1 star, and this film is leagues worse in every aspect. If I could, I would gladly rate it 0. They simply dumbed the main characters down even more and gender swapped them. I thought the pornographic stuff in this first movie was excessive and irrelevant to the plot, but it was at least fun in its own way. Here they reduced any sense of eroticism to pure trashiness (there isn't a single sex scene in this or even much kissing), which begs the question, 'Why is it even in the movie at all?' Even the gore is severely downplayed here with almost all of the action taking place off screen or being shoddily done.One of the few good points of the first film was the believability in the kidnapping and general functioning of a kill club. Now it's somehow an international criminal syndicate with it's dark tendrils in the recesses and pockets of every corner of society (cue the evil laugh). If that were the case, why even bother hiding the club away? They might as well just kidnap people in broad daylight... Which they practically do in this film. I guess drugging people and spiriting them away was too easy, because they forcefully kidnap and restrain each victim here. And then they auction them off. So much for the anonymity. So much easier to torture people when you know their names. So much easier to hide your activities when you leave a paper trail...The kill club worked in the first movie. They didn't show any sort of organizational hierarchy, only goons and scouters. Each client showed up, paid a lump sum in cash, and were presented with a body and a shed's worth of tools. This kept victims expendable. If you promise a specific person, then you have to maintain the merchandise. The rooms were smaller and grittier. It felt almost like a dungeon, but here it feels more like Dracula's cathedral. Not to mention the clients themselves were interesting in the first, but here they aren't compelling at all. It's always disappointing when an artist crafts something, and then destroys a piece of it you thought they understood perfectly in a sequel.I had to force myself to sit through this abortion, watching it in three parts. I mean, seriously, how is the intro even longer and blander? How is there even less action overall? I guess we're putting on kid gloves for the girls because we're supposed to be extra horrified. Anything you thought was done well in the first was lost in translation, and all of it's flaws were amplified tenfold. Don't even bother.",Hostel - Part II
174,graham_525,Could have been great but in the end was just Hollywood,5,29 September 2008,I found the first Hostel genuinely disturbing and it really got under my skin. I watched the sequel with a knot of anticipation in my stomach. It started off fairly well with a sickening sequence in which the girls are auctioned to rich scum bags with families of their own. This could have been a film making a serious and quite profound statement about power and the human condition. When I watched the first Hostel I felt that it was believable that such things go on. Then it struck me that similar things did go in Europe under the Nazis. Murder and torture are the part of the history of Europe from the medieval aristocrats who tortured peasants for entertainment going back to the Coliseum in Rome. It was at one time the vogue for the landed gentry to invent torture equipment and try it out on poor unfortunates kidnapped from the local countryside. So it's reasonable to assume that some of the rich and powerful of modern times have similar appetites.However the two rich protagonists just weren't really disturbing enough. They were a bit of a joke to be honest. I did like the idea though that when one of them actually saw the reality of sticking a saw into a girls face it completely freaked him out. Where this film really went all wrong though was the final interaction between Beth and Stuart and the way the Beth gets herself out of the situation. It turned the whole thing into Hollywood tripe for me and completely destroyed how deeply disturbing this film should have and could have been.,Hostel - Part II
175,tankjonah,Not just more of the same.,6,1 November 2007,"Three American girls (Lauren German, Bijou Phillips, Heather Matarrazzo) on holiday in Europe are enticed to Slovakia by an Italian girl they've met on their travels, who is setting them up for their torture and deaths by the organisation set up to allow sickos to indulge in this.Eli Roth's follow up to his disturbing and gory film of 2005 delivers much of the same in terms of extreme gore and a desire to shock, if not offend audiences. However, it does explore a concept only touched on in the first film. But first the gore.The potentially most offensive scene involves the naked woman who lies in a tub beneath a naked, strung upside down Matarrazzo. She precedes to slash her back from side to side revelling in the blood that pours down and eventually drenches her whilst she gets off. This scene is perhaps inspired by Countess Dracula (1972), where the lead bathes in the blood of murdered virgins, as here Matarrazzo is presented as a naïve virgin. The final scene of gore involves a man's penis being sliced off in full view before being thrown to dogs which pays homage to various Italian cannibal films of the 70s and 80s (e.g. Cannibal Ferox 1980) where the mutilation of genitals was almost standard. However, what's more disturbing than the violence in Hostel 2 (like the first film), except fleshed out here much further, is the depiction of the rich, around the world, bidding on German, Phillips and Matarrazzo via the Internet for the 'privilige' to torture and kill them. This is a more grim extension of the concept explored in The Most Dangerous Game (1932), but somehow feels more realistic and possible today. That such people exist is likely (aside from whether such a thing has actually happened in the real world or not) and this is what makes it disturbing. How far and how low would some people be willing to go? Roth is going for a comment on the evils of excess and rampant capitalism gone mad. The fact that we follow two of the winning bidders (two American businessman), one all talk, the other seemingly hesitant and in two minds about what he's agreed to, brings the film a decidedly different approach than the first film. However, somehow Hostel 2 is ultimately not as good(at least for me). Perhaps it's the lack of real mystery and surprise that the first film had and that none of the three lead characters are particularly likable. Hence, we don't particularly care for them and it's almost annoying that German escapes because she's wealthy. Of course, this is a further comment that Roth wants to make about capitalism, but the point is laboured by this stage. A nice touch (as the first film did with Takashi Miike) is the cameo by Ruggero Deodato, director of Cannibal Holocaust (1980), as a cannibal. A must for fans of gore. Others will no doubt wonder why such films are allowed to exist.",Hostel - Part II
176,Sheldonshells,"Not nearly that good, in fact, it is quite bad",1,1 March 2009,"Ever see the review for this movie written over at allmovie? It goes on far too long for this very culturally insignificant movie. It sounds like it is written by an overly enthusiastic fan here on the IMDb. Seriously they treat it like it a Proust novel--in fact, the review is as long as a Proust novel. It is totally absurd.The movie is just not that important. Not nearly so.I don't detect any social or cultural intelligence from the director when I watched this film. If the movie is supposed to be connected to the torturing going on involving the wars in West Asia and so forth, then it does a poor job addressing it. If this movie is actually supposed to be reflecting that, then you would think it would do a better job with the socio-political commentary that one would expect such reflections would entail. There is no hint that it is doing any more than attempting to produce the greatest jolt from the audience--nothing more. And its attempts failed on this viewer; I think the movie is insipid and boring celluloid garbage--pretty much on the low level of low grade cult classic splatter movies like Maniac. allmovie waaaay overblows it on presenting it as some kind of great social statement on the level of Tobe Hopper and Wes Craven's films of the seventies. I don't detect anything more than an attempt at rattling people's senses. In other words, it is not worthwhile art--at best it is art fart.Another thing that is bad about the movie and not often addressed is the misandry presented in this and the first Hostel movie. Men are shown in an unrelentingly negative light. In fact, about the only thing I found unrelenting and horrific about these films are the ""hostile"" depictions of men. There are only female characters to be written as good, heroic and sympathetic, even if they are psychotic torturers and killers. Of course women are shown being brutally tortured too. But this is precisely to add more shock value: people don't care as much if it happens to men, and movies like this perpetuate that carelessness. The scenes of the women being tortored are meant to be viewed as the most horrific; scenes of men being tortured are just as often made into comedic jokes. It's a scummy and disgusting message--way more disgusting than any gore or disturbing image shown. Oh btw, what great awareness and concern Roth shows by bringing attention to the nasty realities of our world including torture when the people being denigrated in the movie are for the most part men yet most of the people actually being tortured in reality are men (not to mention almost all the ones dying in the battle fields are men too). Yeah....what great and perceptive social commentary.Then again, it is what is. But what it is is fairly insignificant and forgettable. And if it indeed does actually attempt to say something about today's harsher and bleak realities (of the wars, Bush's blind eye to victims of torture, etc), it makes the case poorly and if anything it's just a part of the whole problem of today. It seems Roth and the audience that likes this junk is as bad and complacent of torture--at least when it's happening to men--as Bush is. Does anyone with a working mind really think that people are going to leave this movie with some kind of enlightened awareness of the horrific reality of torture? Do you think they are going to say anything other than mention how 'cool' and 'gross' some of the scenes are? Pfff...speaking of awareness and reality....Sorry, but I'm not as easily tricked as some people over at allmovie seem to be. Perhaps they should get someone to re-write the review. Cut it down by a few pages and get someone who isn't like a rabid Hansen fan from 1998. *Btw, I know that this review is kind of long too--so I'm kind of a hypocrite, but I felt it was necessary in order to supply criticism where it is due and to make something that matches up against the glowy review by allmovie. Also, I'm discussing the BAD (ie, crap) things about the movie, not imagined good things, so obviously that's going to make it longer ; )--Hope that explains it.",Hostel - Part II
177,kalay,Despite warnings why censorship?,7,28 August 2007,"I was expecting the same success as Part I from Hostel Part II before going to the movie. Of course success means different from one to other. From my point of view if the story is strong and movie is beyond my imagination I called it successful movie. Hostel part I was such kind of talented story. But I got a little bit disappointed when I watched Part II. This is not the fault of Eli Roth. Even there are too many warnings such as crime, age 18, etc. Most of the parts have been taken out by the authorities in order to protect our brain health. We pay Money, we go to movie willingly, but somebody protect you for severe violence. After warnings censorship sounds ironic.I understand that why the movie criticized by Slovakian people. After watching movies it is very hard to keep the desire to visit Bratislava, Slovakia for touristic tour. If you still would like to visit you had better take one way ticket. Just joking of course. Historical dark castles, the environment, outlandish culture like Transylvania should make Slovakia as a good horror movie background.Rather the story in first movie depend on boys, in the part II there are girls who walk around as a backpack tourist and find out bloody adventures. These series are neither like horror nor crime movies. As it is said not classified indeed. If we take into consideration realistic story, sharp views, full savageness Hostel series more than a movie.I wish I could watch all of the scenes, and then I could criticize the Hostel Part II much healthier. Alas, in my position I can say that not as staggering as Part I.",Hostel - Part II
178,baileygiannini,A TERRIBLE MESS ALL AROUND!,1,1 July 2018,"Hostel (2005) was as terrible as watching paint dry. However, this sequel to the first film takes a new all time low. I wouldn't rewatch this movie even if you paid me. This is far more worse than the first film. It's practically the same movie again, this time with the opposite sex. Having women being the victims and tortured is way more disgusting and sick than watching the men in the first film go through it. If anyone has any brains at all, they will certainly want to do a petition to ban all Hostel films from the US. The one after this awful sequel is the only one that's okay. Hostel Part II features more body parts ripping to shreds and more full frontal nudity. Swearing is here in this film again and it doesn't let up. There's really not much else to say except, the acting is terrible, the special effects are way to gruesome, no imaginary creativitay was done while this movie was in the shooting process and it's just garbage all around. It's a film that I only keep around to remind me of my Grandma. Other than that, I would've thrown it away in the trash can outside of my house a long time ago. The storyline's boring as anything possible. I'd rather look up in the sky and see different shapes of clouds than watch this terrible garbage that was made to rip horror fans off once again. Awful directions and very poorly written was the script when Eli Roth wrote it. Cabin Fever was better than this. I'm waiting to see if Eli Roth can come up with something truly terrifying, not the same rehashed garbage that other filmmakers having been putting out for years on end. From me, this is a huge thumbs down.For an overall rating, I give Hostel Part II0 Stars.

179,Franco-23,"Just hope to see ""Hostel III"" soon! *spoilers*",8,21 October 2007,"I think ""Hostel"" and ""Hostel II"" are both very good films in this gender. I congratulate Eli Roth and Tarantino. The shots are impeccable, the locations are well selected, the protagonists are good, as is the sound, etc. There are few little details that I would have used less in the sequel -like the gang of gypsy street kids- but all in all I think the selection of scenes was ideal. I definitely hope we'll have at least ""Hostel III"", there is plenty of material and the story remains wide open for some new twists: *spoilers* - First, there is Beth -the survivor- who has now committed two crimes herself and is now an ACTIVE member of the club (great psychological material) - Then there is Sasha -the boss- whose role could be extended - Also the guy at the front desk could be offered a more active participation in the sequel -let's say he's been sort of promoted ... - Some Slovakians from part II would make interesting casual victims (like the fat one who hits and delivers Lorna and the other guy that seduced the blonde one) - The main ""products"" offered through the internet in the new story could perfectly be from several nationalities. (I know there's an American issue going on -specially in Europe- but for these clients' twisted minds there should be more incentives, other than origin and nationality... similar to what happened to Stuart who just wanted somebody who resembled his wife). What about some British paying to get some adrenaline with french or Spanish meat or vice-versa? I could keep going... Count me in for the sequel!",Hostel - Part II
180,surface6669,Why you should skip this movie...,6,15 March 2008,"and just see the first one instead. I loved the first Hostel because of its fantastic embrace of showing *all* the gore & having a plot that had twists & turns that you couldn't see coming. In this second installment, there is plenty of gore still, but they use a technique of showing you the gore, then cutting away from it briefly, then cutting back to it again as if to say, ""Yes, you really did see that the first time around"". It's funny.The other thing that is different about this newer version is that they show you some of the background to why the ""bad guys"" are bad, and how they are ""organized"". However, this, I think, dispels a HUGE amount of the tension that a movie like this needs to have. You already know who the bad guys are, who the victims are, etc., etc.. Almost everything, minus some small twists & turns, is laid out for you ahead of time. This leaves little in the amount of suspense IMO.My other small beef with this film is that they don't actually *show* one of the main characters being killed! I mean, this is what the whole Hostel mindset is about...actually showing you how people get killed, not just referring to someone being killed later. It's almost as if they ran out of money in the special effects budget or something like that. It's not like the movie was too long to begin with (~90 mins.).I also didn't like the fact that I knew some of the actors that were playing the main characters. It's not like there are any huge names here, but there are some actors that you'd be hard pressed not to recognize. The exact reason that the first movie worked, I think, is because it didn't have a lot of known actors in it...like the Scream movies did.There's plenty of bad behavior, nudity, gore, and the like, but not enough to warrant this movie to be anything less than disappointing. I expected a lot more from Eli Roth. You got my money though...so he should be happy now... :(",Hostel - Part II
181,jboyaquar,Just Awful,2,14 July 2007,"Witless, Frightless, Uninventive are just a few of the many poor adjectives anyone should attribute to the increasingly pathetic exploitative output of the hack known as Eli Roth. There is exactly 45 seconds of interest in this wanna-be connoisseur of torture porn: a) the Elizabeth Bathory bloodbath scene and b) thigh for dinner? The rest repeats the exact trajectory of the first instead with three forgettable leads; the bland though, of course, resourceful Lauren German, Bijou Phillips repeating the same bratty tendencies that afflict every obnoxious character she inhabits, and in the cruelest joke of them all - Heather Matarazzo bullied by the public's association of her from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse."" In reality, her voluptuous figure and facial features as well as her oddball way of communicating with her environment are by far the most interesting aspect of this dud. How deaden were Roth's attempts to connect these perversities to the bored tendencies of the average corporate suburban men? And did any of the absurd characters and their role reversals provide any fulfillment? Unlike 'Subspecies' which successfully melded susceptible western women with eastern Europe's foreign rituals and odd looking characters, the men recruited to seduce our helpless heroines sneered as if on displaying 'tude' for their next model shoot. Suspenseless and stupid.",Hostel - Part II
182,bernygilbo,Another Roth chill fest,7,10 May 2020,Far better acting than the first film. Same story but with female tourists . A lot more blood and gore which I appreciated.

183,bml84,A Diamond in the Dreck...,5,15 July 2007,"Firstly, yes, it IS a bad movie. The idea is nasty enough but the execution is very uneasy in its execution. Swings from juvenile humour to juvenile gross outs still total juvenile content.Still, the problem may lie in the feeling that there is actually a deeper idea stifled beneath all the gloss gore. As an exploration of the objectification of women, it has some ideas, none too well handled or explored.The first killing reflects the 'sexualisation' of Elizabeth bathory, a true 'serial-killer' but overly sexualised by the 'blood-bathing' myth that grew around her. Woman as object & objectifier.The second is most interesting. As a sexualised object, she is an easy victim, but damaged she becomes recognisably human and the realisation dawns she is not just an object, like a pin-up, creating guilt.The survivor escapes her plight by 'becoming' the object desired, playing a role as a fantasy model which ultimately empowers her to turn the tables on her tormentor.Its the uneasy mix of insightful, 'knowing' and gross out gore that makes such an uneasy mix that doesn't quite gel.Oh, and the ending is crap...",Hostel - Part II

Not to say there's anything wrong with what he utilizes his talents for. So far, both his Hostel films have shown immense originality in a throwback type of way and the sequel in particular is not only very successfully shocking but is well shot, well paced and does more than just deliver an entertaining night at the movies...it makes us feel alive. AND...does so with style. Also, Roth's amazing sense of humor, although covert, is very evident in Hostel II and will warrant more than several lighthearted chuckles from many members of the audience. ~ Summer blockbusters...sh*t; Oscar nominees...pretentious; animated films...need more nudity. Hostel II, on the other hand, may offend you because of its subject matter but won't at the hands of bad writing, formulaic action sequences, intelligence-insulting premises and overly long, muddled, Oscar-driven bullsh*t that uses rock songs to convey emotion (*cough* The Departed). His screenplay is dead-on to say the least; it's written sharply and with care...the cinematography - noticeably stylish and gritty...the acting - unknown but authentic and as impressive as any star-studded cast I've ever seen. Finally, when its all said and done, the concept truly is horrifying and will probably be more appreciated in the future.",Hostel - Part II
185,boc321,hostile hostel 2 critics need their heads examined (or drilled),10,4 June 2007,"What a masterpiece! As a fan of realistic horror gore films, this is the cream of the crop. This film reminds me very much of Salo - 120 days of sodomy, but much more enjoyable. Contrary to some critics i thought the first film was good in principle but the plot holes made the whole thing unrealistic and laughable. The people employed to attract fresh slaughterhouse recruits seem more professional in this sequel. It is rare for the sequel to surpass the first film but in this case it does. The gory sequences are not overly long or gruesome, thanks to most tools not being cordless! The strong message in the film is about what predicaments you could find yourself in by trusting strangers too much, something happy go lucky tourists are all too keen to do, but then we cant spend out life wrapped in cotton wool. The contrast of extrovert and introverted tourists is also very clever, as it makes no difference when you take a chance. Bring on hostel 3.",Hostel - Part II
186,gzamikes,Eli Roth is capable of making better movies than this.,3,19 June 2007,"Hostel 2 has a basic plot of same thing, different gender but it elaborates on the business to keep it from being merely a rehash and it does that by going behind the scenes to follow two customers on their way to take part in the twisted experience. When the movie isn't following the behind the scenes crowd, it's just a lower quality rehash of the first movie. Except in this one you know the order people are going to die right when you meet them, you know who the enemies are right when they're introduced and the only surprises left are how everything is going to wrap up. There are a few surprises in here that can be missed if you're not looking closely enough but they're buried under lots of bad jokes that don't work and just the feeling that you're watching a great director phone it in.For example, his fake trailer in Grindhouse was an effective parody of the slasher genre but while he wasn't looking he became a parody of himself with this movie. Don't expect anything going in because that's what you'll get.P.S. - Whoever is saying there's more gore in this one is wrong. There's a very short, very squeamish scene but everything else is obviously fake and there's less of it.",Hostel - Part II

I enjoyed the enhanced story about the infrastructure of the factory and the fact that we are introduced more intimately to a couple of the customers.The story is familiar, if you saw the first movie (or even if you didn't), and plot twists are guessable, but I liked the fact that they were in there, anyway.The acting across the board is good to very good.All in all, a fun, enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",Hostel - Part II

189,little_rhody,It can stand on it's own,8,24 June 2007,"Horror sequels are often times carbon copies of the original: same premise; same focus; same victims; same villains. Hostel Part II breaks all the old sequel rules and presents a fresh look at the same industry that terrorized back-packers in the first film.The film opens with a short sequence to bridge the first Hostel and this one before introducing the victims and villains of this film. We are shown the behind the scenes workings of the Hostel and factory, and we are presented with a number of plot twists. I think there was an equal emphasis on the gore and torture in this film...but maybe after seeing Hostel the shock value was lost. Regardless, the introduction of tongue-in-cheek humor into Hostel Part II gives it a different feel from the first, and it's a great way of redirecting our expectations of this film.Where the Final Destination series is basically the same film, over and over again with different death scenes, Hostel Part II is not the same as Hostel, and that's a good thing.Eli, I'm looking forward to a Part III",Hostel - Part II
190,AJ_is_Awesomness,Gruesome..Disturbing...Brutal...Hostel: Part 2 Delivers!,9,1 June 2007,"Eli Roth is, what the US can call, a happy young director-much like the younger Quentin Tarantino. In fact, Roth is vastly becoming the young Tarantino, hooked on delivering gore feasts and twisted flicks with an underestimated plot and numerous details to make the whole complexity of the movies he makes stronger. Roth began his reign with Cabin Fever, a film which gore-hounds instantly lapped up. Then, with a little help from Tarantino himself, Roth took on Hostel, which was a squeamishly entertaining, if not slightly morbid piece of snuffery in a torture flick. Whilst Hostel didn't exactly get the critics screaming, even they had to admit that the movie had balls, if not brains.Hostel 2 is much of the same. The story evolves around three students travelling to Slovakia where they encounter a ware-house of terror and torture. OK, that is pretty obvious- yes there is torture, yes there are pretty girls, and yes once again the setting is in the beautiful picturesque town in Slovakia, which plays host to the hidden warehouse. Except this time, the torture chambers are a lot bigger and a lot harder to escape from (in Hostel Part One, main character Paxton and his lady accomplish managed to sneak their way out of the chambers-) no such look this time. Now, the chambers are bolted up and require a labelled code to use the exit doors. Too bad for our young chicks.Anyways, now the security is ramped up, the capture and torture scenes are obviously a lot worse. And so are the methods used in snuffing of the 'victims' with decapitated heads, upside down neck slashing, blades of fury and in one particularly nasty scene, a brutally realistic penis chop. Now, I hear you say- how can they let a movie like this ever hit theatres, especially when it is perhaps arguably more violent than previous video-nasties such as Cannibal Holocaust, and in such terms perhaps the answer to that is unknown. Eli Roth admitted himself that he expects the BBFC to wrap him over the amounts of gore used. He even boasted that the gore scenes were so intense that he himself could not watch! Yes, this movie is violent, yes there are buckets of the red stuff spurting about, and yes sometimes the scenes playing are disturbing, but Hostel: Part 2 still pays off as being very entertaining. Squirmish. Yes. Bloody. Hell yes. Gruesome. Need I say yeah. But no matter how twisted this movie is, it is definitely going to sell a lot of popcorn. I have seen the movie once, and once is enough (trust me this isn't something you want to re-watch) but all in all, it is an experience I am glad I took on. I am also happy to see the return of the fabulous Jay Hernandez (who played the hero in the first movie) however, be warned- he is also on the hit list!!! 9/10",Hostel - Part II
191,pahaake,Does not disappoint,10,9 June 2007,"Look, if you didn't like this installment - you probably didn't like the original. If neither Hostel scared you, you live under a rock and can't see the possibility that this could happen. People (especially rich Americans) are SICK - look at Paris Hilton if you don't believe me. She would pay money to kill someone if she heard it was ""hot"".Yes, Bijou Phillips and Heather Matarazzo both suck but they certainly don't ruin an excellent Roth film. I had no expectations - and I loved it. It was violent and clever and to me a great sequel. Lauren German is amazing, and incredibly nice to look at without being typical Hollywood bimbo eye candy.I don't EVER comment on movies here - in fact this is my first. I am only commenting because a 5.6 is RIDICULOUS and reflects only the intelligence of the viewing audience, not the quality of this film. The suspense and gore are just right, the ending is really two pronged. One extremely hard to watch - and one a little cheesy, but if you paid attention in Hostel you'll get it. If you didn't like this sequel then you should go watch some boring foreign film and praise yourself for your amazing intellect.If you want to be entertained, and you enjoy the Tarantino / Roth combo go see it - you won't be sorry.",Hostel - Part II
192,sverrehu,Almost totally had me,5,10 October 2008,"*** SPOILER ALERT ***This movie totally had me, up until the final 20 minutes or so. There's a long and good character building phase, in which we get to see just one killing, which may in fact be the most gruesome part of the movie.Then there's this family guy (Stuart) who really doesn't want to take part in the killing, but who's there anyway, thanks to his macho friend (Todd). When I wrote this, IMDb had the following User Comment: ""Sadistic Sequel with a Great Twist"". To me the great twist was that family guy: A 100% humane guy caught up in a setting where he was supposed to be 100% inhumane. How the hell was he going to get out of this situation alive, preferably saving the chick on the way? This was something I hadn't seen before.But then all of a sudden, the macho friend turns into the soft fellow, and the family man turns into a wife-hating maniac. A switch worthy of any 70's B horror.Then there's another twist in the end, but it sort of drowned in my disappointment.Could have been between 8 and 10, but ended up as 5 for me.",Hostel - Part II
193,kimberlymhn,"Violent, stupid and not even shocking.",2,7 March 2008,"I did enjoy the original Hostel, but this was so predictable the only good thing about it is that Roth managed to keep the budget low. What really made me angry was the overall stupidity of the plot. Any killer knows that it makes sense to kidnap and kill people who won't be missed. Killing wealthy Americans as the Hostel owners are doing in this movie would soon lead to the discovery of their organisation. Our two 'hot' heroines and their geeky companion (the woefully wasted Heather Materazzo) are lured to the Hostel by a glamorous life model. Materazzo is tricked by the other two into getting drunk & goes off with a guy who takes her to the torture dungeon. Poor Heather ends up getting cut up by a Elizabeth Bathory type woman who bathes in her blood. Like Tarantino in the crappy 'Death Proof' we have the 'cool' female characters putting a friend in danger and not caring. The sub plot with the two American hostel visitors was just as pointless with role reversal at the end just plain daft & I absolutely HATED the 'Don't kill me, my daddy has lots of money' ending. Hostel II has no tension, no excitement no originality and isn't even scary or shocking. No doubt Roth will return to the horror genre, but he'll have to work much harder than this to retain an audience.",Hostel - Part II
194,lexs_luv_bunny,Hostel Part II,7,27 August 2007,"I have given this lower points than the first film I reviewed because I feel that despite the more detailed story then the real winner was the original. The film worked in explaining the story to us, but giving us a tour of this unbelievable world, where people bid to kill others. Rich men and women bid on people from other countries, depending on their nationality, depends on how much they go for. These people are then captured whilst they are holidaying and are locked up in a dilapidated old building where they are tortured brutally to their deaths. Its a highly believable story and one which scared me from the word go. The thought of being targeted in this way, when you alone in a country you know nothing about, when your defences and your confidence are already low. Its too much to imagine and this is what helps the film to grip you and thrill you, scare you into submission. There are scenes that you long to hide from, but you find it impossible to look away. Like the other film, it brings you enough blood and gore to satisfy any horror loving fan, but I much prefer the first film, because although the second offered more scares, then you can only have too much of a good thing, before it all becomes too familiar.",Hostel - Part II

You ll see things that you ve never seen again on the screen. I hope that nothing will be 'cut' and the full version will play in theaters. If you believe SAW 3 is the freakiest horror movie ever to date.. you are wrong! Slovakia is once again the place in Hostel 2. Like the first film, it takes over 1 hour to see splatter scenes which is very disappointing. The grande finale though makes all splatter fans very very happy. he-he. One more thing I must say.. movies such as HOSTEL are made for gore-fans and not for aunt Lindy! So please If you don't like certain movies just go and watch The princess Diaries ore something. Don't judge horror genres if you have no clue about horror films. Overall Hostel 2 is a bit boring but has some very good moments in the middle and a kick-ass last 20 minutes. Scenes never again seen in the movies. Very funny also. 7/10... Gore fans get ready... and enjoy!!!",Hostel - Part II
196,khunia,"Mysoginistic, Sadistic, Depraved and Just Wrong",1,13 June 2007,"How anyone can view this movie as a horror is beyond me, the use of extreme violence and extreme gore to create box office sales and scares is totally beyond me. How a person could watch this and say ""wow that is a really good movie"" is totally beyond me. Now Eli Roth the man who directs this movie believes because society has been through so much (he quotes 9/11) and our children are growing up in this environment (he quotes iraq war/ 9/11 directly) that this is the reason why he had to take it that 1 step further. Now this movie relies totally on its extreme violence and gore to push its case, honestly if that is what you were after then maybe we should get a cut down version with just those parts in it and loop the tape so that those with a penchant for this sort of drivel can get there kicks. There are seriously some better horror movies out there that don't need mass amounts of violence, torture and gore. I watched this movie and instead of the thrill of anticipation before something grisly there was only the expectation that it was inevitable that something violent was about to happen.When did we as a society actually accept this type of movie? when did we find it entertaining? I could never recommend this film to anyone, to me it is nothing more than a grasp at box office dollars and is a sad reflection on human society that this is now accepted. My biggest thought of this movie is ""What The ?"".To Eli Roth shame, shame, shame.....",Hostel - Part II

I won't get into details because I want to forget it as fast as possible. The ""plot"" is simple: Some hot American chicks travel across Europe and end up in some God forsaken East European country. They get kidnapped by an organization that offers wealthy individuals the opportunity to ""cultivate"" their sadistic nature. That's about it. Plus the obligatory ""titty time"".

If you liked Hostel 1, you probably won't like this one as it is much different.There isn't as much slow pace character building as in the previous one. Nor is there torture chamber suspense. This movie doesn't creep you out when you leave the theater like the first Hostel does. It is pretty forgettable. Hostel 1 had a great ending that was very memorable (Paxton killing the Dutch businessman in a violent way and leaving on the train), this one didn't.

199,john-1451,Roth/Tarantino just don't understand,3,11 June 2007,"If you are going to make homages to b movies, at least understand them. With ""Grindhouse"" and now ""Hostel 2"", Roth and Tarantino have proved that they don't have a clue as to what makes a cheap genre picture work. Don't get me wrong, I like both of these directors, and like the majority of their movies, but their recent turn to b movie sensibilities just isn't working. They seem to emphasize cute and clever movie tricks when they should just dish out the horror or action. Build up should be just that and not marking time. ""Brevity is the soul of wit"" is a phrase they should take to heart. That's what makes movies like ""I Drink Your Blood"", or ""The Flesh Eaters"", classics-not long stretches of pointless dialog. As to Hostel 2-WTF. After Bijou Phillips character is disfigured, she basically disappears. I know that she is killed, but they don't even show the guy going into her room, so there is no closure on her character at all. In fact, if they had concentrated more on the two businessmen, and the infrastructure of Elite Huntings management, it would have been a far more original and interesting movie than what was merely a gender switching rehash of the original. Eli Roth, I know there's a great movie in you-start working on it instead of rehashing b movie clichés.",Hostel - Part II
200,jimmykebab,Good,8,6 July 2007,"But unfortunately not great. The start however is blisteringly tense, creating an overwhelming sense of paranoia and dread. Picking up straight after the first one, this should have been the main story line for the film. Paxton was the most interesting character in the film and hes only in it for about ten minutes. The introduction of the new three backpackers is lightly handled, and the build up to the horror is more gradual perhaps than in the first, with with Roth experimenting with different effects and ways of creating a tense atmosphere. One of the biggest problems with the film was that it seemed to be mirroring the first film a little too much, a number of the shots are almost identical and the hostel is the same one from the first. I personally thought there was going to be a different setting for the film, so was a little disappointed that this wasn't the case. However, outside of the hostel different locations are explored, in particular the freaky outdoor spa area.The actual horror was actually not as horrific as it was tipped to be, the torture in this is much less disturbing and unsettling than the first, the tone was much softer, and more comic.One new feature that Roth included to vary the events was to build a storyline about American businessman travelling and waiting to torture someone. This was quite a clever and at times unsettling (when one of them is having breakfast at the family dinner table and receives the phonecall about it). But this also detracts from the actual horror and mystery that was the in the first film.Ultimately this is still worth watching, but is less visceral than the outlandish first installment, its still an effective horror, but just less impactful. If this had taken the course it was suggesting at the start of the film it would have been better, as it would have been more interesting to have followed Paxton's character further rather than setting up the audience with new characters too soon.",Hostel - Part II

The thing i liked about this movie though is the fact that u can feel some of what there feeling and that's what makes a movie like this pretty good.

202,Vishboy,Hostel 2 is Unsettling!,7,26 June 2007,"When Eli Roth came out with ""Hostel"", the movie was aptly described by a lot of critics as 'Torture-Porn'! 3 guys looking for sex and getting themselves into trouble in a far-away (and not that routine) place was very believable. Hostel 2 follows the same path, it's just that the guys pass on the baton to 3 girls this time. And of course, unlike the guys, these girls venture off to the unknown for pleasures (which probably includes sex for one of the 3 characters), but not just sex! But what makes Hostel 2 work is the the whole dynamics of the ""Elite Hunting"" organization that Eli Roth showcases. The torture scenes might be a dejavu of SAW 3 or the previous Hostel movie, but it's the concept of the ""Elite Hunting"" that makes one shudder. The vast reach of the gang, it's working style, the 'contracts' that are signed when bidding are finalised, they make a very disturbing (and should I add a chilling) viewing. Hostel 2 is no landmark cinema but it's a tad above the first installment. Watch it, for it might make you think about the concept of an ""Organisation""!",Hostel - Part II
203,mustafa_er,Not great but better than the first part.,6,6 June 2007,"Contains Spoilers Saw it yesterday and I thought it was not great but pretty enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised.I don't know how to write a review, I'm terrible at it but wanna share how I think about this gore flick.First up, I didn't like the first part. After the big hype for the first part I had expected a lot but nothing was. I hated Hostel 1. Lemme tell you this before I begin to write my short review; I don't consider Hostel: Part II as a horror film. Having said that Hostel II is a bad horror flick, but is an enjoyable thriller imo if you look from that angle.The film starts off from where the first movie ended. Again we find a group of kids going to the infamous Slovakian Hostel. But this time no boys, we have a bunch of sexy girls instead. Meeting on the train bla bla bla. I hated the girls though ( frankly said, I hate most of the actresses in horror films). For me very childish, girlish, annoying and slut-ish. AS for the story, it offers nothing original. Like many cheap horror films, there is no plot, the story was flawed. Moreover, it has a boring, silly and brainless plot, too. The beginning of the film dragged a bit but I liked the end though. Very surprising end for me.After the half, towards the end it got better, and incredibly violent and sadistic. From enjoying torture, to having ""bloody"" shower J , and I mean ""bloody shower"". A blood bath under a hanging and bleeding body ! There are some extreme scenes that made me smirk. Yes, the extremity is sort of funny. This and other bloody scenes reminded me of Kill Bill Vol.1. I assume you know what I mean. Typical Tarantino bloodbath.Despite the stupid plot, annoying girls I enjoyed this flick. It scared me emotionally as well to tell you the truth. Is it worth seeing it in the cinema ? Hmmm, yes ! Go and watch this film.6/10",Hostel - Part II
204,callahan-patrick,Arguably the worst film ever made,1,16 June 2009,"Some will like that I wrote ""arguably,"" however I feel dirty to even write that. To get something clear, I am the kind of guy to watch sequels even if I disliked the original (this is how I had come to like ""Devil's Rejects""). However, even ""Hostel"" had its moments and admirable traits. For example, I believe Mr. Roth captured the young adult attitude in some cases. Also, the ending of ""Hostel"" was also decently well-played. This film, however, has none of that. For me, there is nothing worth admiring. However, the movie did attempt to have a cool twist, but ended up shooting themselves in the foot. The attempt in itself was also a poor one because the twist had absolutely NO logic behind it. The hour and a half I spent watching it seemed more excruciating to me than the teenagers being physically tortured throughout the film. Some may think as to why write a such a negative review. I wrote this for two reasons. For one, I felt that I needed to portray how awful this film really is; two, as a less selfish reason,I didn't want others to suffer the same effect of this ""movie."" There it is, all I can say now is too steer clear from this pathetic eyesore and, if you see it at the store, ignore it and don't even look in its general direction. For this movie, not only made me ten times dumber, but also made me feel ashamed of myself. The only good part of the film was that it made me realize how much I LOATHE Eli Roth with every fiber of my body. The only people who would enjoy this are those with sadistic pain fetish.

We also follow their soon-to-be victims, as they are lured to the hostel. We see the inner workings of the business, how it's run, and how people place bids on potential victims (some of it is pretty comedic and frightening at the same time).

The best part was when the guys dick got ripped out but otherwise they spend too much time trying to get you to sympathize with the characters. I'm pretty sure I was laughing more than holding my hands over my eyes. It's really not even worth 10.95 but if you MUST go, go with a really low expectation and you might think it was decent. I admit the concept was pretty kool. The bidding for victims was interesting I found but it just didn't play out that well. The scene where the guy is laughing at the girls reaction to the saw (bijou) and he ends up pulling the cord too far and it de-plugs and he looks surprised was kinda funny but otherwise any comedy was stupid. It's also pretty damn predictable... sorry folks, this is just a let down horror with weak nudity. Nothing special.",Hostel - Part II

It showed too much blood gore and nasty stuff but still the movie had something going, it still kept you interested. This movie seemed like a low budget grade B movie (even though it wasn't). Nothing in the movie was well thought of. It was just like as if ""let us just show some nudity and blood and surely the audience will be happy"". A pathetic sequel to a much better movie. Even the ending is not well thought up. I am sure many people will go to see this movie expecting better than Hostel 1 and will be severely disappointed like I was.",Hostel - Part II
209,rascal67,Can't wait for Hostel: Part 3,7,17 June 2007,"Wow! I lapped up every minute of this fine polished sequel to Eli Roth's raw and unnerving 'Hostel'. It ended quite abruptly and I just sat there with my mouth agape. I just wanted more and there are not many modern day horror films I can say that about.The first 'Hostel' took me by surprise and I found it to be more compelling than I had anticipated. This second installment is equally enthralling and grabbed me by the......... well if you have seen this film you will know what I'm talking about.Although bloody and sadistically violent; it is also darkly funny and populated with some of the strangest; menacing and unusual looking characters to grace the silver screen in quite some time. I felt I was in 'Argento' territory here during some of the sequences and this is most certainly not a bad thing at all. The design of the film was great, with some excellent cinematography and evocative music that all melded together to create an exciting; tense and dare I say entertaining movie experience. Not for the faint of heart—but it wasn't made for pussies!",Hostel - Part II

211,moviedoors,Truly a let down.,3,8 June 2007,"Oh, Eli. What happened? Cabin Fever was a fun horror flick and the first Hostel had its moments, but this? My excitement over a Roth helmed Cell has just dropped dramatically.Opening where the first film left off, things get off to a bad start as we meet back up with Paxton, with Jay Hernandez phoning in a curiously wooden performance. The first ""scares"" are very poorly handled and obvious.After the pointless prologue, we meet our new gender swapped protagonists. Bijou Phillips's is the obnoxious, one-dimensional slut who just wants to sleep with Viktor Krum. Heather Matarazzo's Lorna should have been a good character. Matarazzo is a talented actress, but here she hams it up too much and Roth piles on the ""she's an introverted nerd!"" touches far too heavily. She's sorta the Josh of Hostel II, only Lorna is a cartoon where as Josh actually seemed like a guy you could meet in a college algebra class. Lauren Graham turns in a pretty good performance and Beth is the only one of these females who actually feels somewhat like a real person.The new twist on the formula lies in Roger Bart and Richard Burgi's prospective killers. Here's where Roth could have gotten really dark and interesting. Everyone who saw the first Hostetl remembers Rick Hoffman's whacked out, creepy performance as the American Client. Bart and Burgi's characters could have been used to expand on that creepiness as well as bring in some genuine interest in Bart's character's reluctance, amping up the suspense. But no! Instead these characters are shallow, barely explored personalities and Roth uses them for some cheap plot contrivances in the third act.For a horror flick, the movie has surprisingly little scares. Scratch that, it has no scares. There was not a moment in this movie where I didn't see the jumps coming and there is little in the way of suspense. The first Hostel had some genuinely suspenseful moments and Cabin Fever even had a few ""don't do that!"" moments. This film has gruesome moments for sure (that this movie got an R rating is the final nail in the coffin for the MPAA's credibility. If Shakespeare in Love and Hostel II share the same rating, something is seriously wrong). The first kill is undeniably effective in being unnerving, but it lacks suspense, which is the secret when a film is toeing the line of bad taste. This was simply inescapable murder on display.Interestingly, the rest of the gruesomeness that ensues is much different in tone. Much of the third act has an almost slapstick vibe, but Roth lacks the grace and timing of splatstick alumni like Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson to truly pull it off. There is also a completely superfluous scene involving a man with a gun and some children that literally served no purpose. Roth was trying so hard to be shocking in that scene that it had the opposite affect on me: I just stared blankly at the screen. I couldn't care less about this completely pointless detour featuring Roth going ""look! Aren't I shocking!""One last complaint and boy is it a big one: Nathan Barr's score. This movie had one of the worst scores I've heard in years. Barr's music sounds like something someone would write if they were making fun of all the clichés of the horror score. That worked for the campy tone of Cabin Fever, but it completely destroys any opportunity for suspense in this film.I know Eli Roth has a really good film in him. After Hostel II, I fear the wait for that movie will be longer than I was expecting. I hope he's finally scratched that itch for paying homage to his favorite horror flicks and his shock for shock's sake fetish. If that makes its way into his adaption of Stephen King's Cell, we'll have lost a great story ripe for screen translation to a promising young filmmaker whose head got too big too fast.",Hostel - Part II
212,flumpman-1,Perhaps the worst sequel ever!,4,12 June 2007,"I have just watched this movie and as a (minor) fan of the original I have to say I am actually annoyed at how bad this movie is! The first movie was OK and had some memorable scenes, likable characters and that bit with the eye! This movie had nothing going! It was slow, tedious, irritating and just a big pile of random s*** on a stick! The characters were just annoying and the whole thing with Roger Bart's character and his stupid from friend Desperate Housewives was just pathetic and pointless.For a sequel that could have been so promising and taken things to another level, Hostel part poo just failed to deliver and I beg anyone who reads this to take my word for it and avoid this movie at all costs! If you are after a horror sequel which is worth watching then I would personally watch Friday the 13th Part 2 which is absolutely awful but so so so much better than Hostel Part 2! Oh, and Eli Roth - you officially suck!",Hostel - Part II
213,scorpion83,Not anywhere near to the first part !!,5,7 June 2007,"The first part was a hit because overall it had a very different plot and storyline. This second part fails in both these categories and looks as if it was made, just to make some money ONLY in the opening weekend/day.The story is terrible and none of the characters fit in the plot. The writers had tried too hard to make some sort of connection between the first and second part and the result is a totally ridiculous start to the movie. Since there was nothing left to squeeze out of this story, the director has ended up squeezing balls in the climax !!Overall, there is not one thing in the movie that would make it worth watching in the theatre and I cant believe why this movie did not end with this !! Cmon we do not expect a trilogy out of HOSTEL !!",Hostel - Part II
214,adelca02,True horror,10,2 July 2020,"Eli Roth is a genius for making Hostel 1 & 2.
I have seen them several times, and each time is still engaging, suspenseful, entertaining, thrilling horror. If you are easily offended or turned off by gore, it may not be for you. It's artful & unique.
As a horror fan, I definitely must recommend.",Hostel - Part II
215,obscurecinema,Is this really what the people want?,3,13 November 2007,"More torture porn. Is anyone else tired of this tripe? I'll toss kudos to the director for at least giving us an entertaining 80's throwback in the first HOSTEL, (and dare I say even a message, of sorts??), but now we're into lazy SAW territory.Is this what the kids are into these days? Where are the characters? Where is the suspense? Where is my $1.50 rental fee? Well, the buck fifty was at least worth the few genuine laughs scattered throughout. If only I didn't have to sit through the rest. (And by HAVE TO, I mean: I cannot turn a film off once it starts... A blessing, and a curse).In all seriousness, I'm really bored with this wave of the genre, and HOSTEL II just cemented my feelings into fact. Its over.",Hostel - Part II
216,john_perry,Not quite sure what to make of Hostel: Part II,5,4 November 2007,"For some odd reason I rented Hostel: Part II as soon as it came out on DVD, even though I recall not being a huge fan of Hostel. The original Hostel, while it had an interesting premise and an intense ending, was marred from having an unfocused, immature first half that acted more as a teenage sex comedy than a horror film.In comes Hostel: Part II. I usually swear off sequels, I was curious to check this one out, mainly because Eli Roth both wrote and directed it. So I believe it was a continuation of his own story, rather than a studio cash-grab made by other filmmakers.There were a few things I liked about Hostel: Part II: the story itself is more focused, and the trio of heroines are more likable than the under-sexed frat-boys of the original. As well, Roth doesn't focus only on the would-be victims, he also fleshes out the characters of the torturers and takes a glimpse into the (hopefully) fictional underworld of Eastern European torture chambers.Overall, however, the film boils down to a gross-out ""I can't believe they just showed that"" shockfest as it nears the end. When I say that the blood bath scene is probably the most disturbing scene I have ever seen in a movie, Roth would likely take that as a compliment.My rating is pretty much neutral because both Hostel films are not ones I will watch over and over again, once is more than enough. Though I will say, if Eli Roth decides to make a third installment, I'll probably watch it.",Hostel - Part II
217,shinnosuke,People that hate this movie need their head examined...,9,30 November 2008,"I loved this movie, it followed the old school Friday the 13th vein of killing off the survivor in the sequel. It fleshed out more of who was who and what was what from the original Hostel. Once again it did not disappoint. One of the few movies where people told me I had to see the movie and where it actually exceeded my expectations. The plot twist at the end is worth the price of admission or a queue at NetFlix. This movie was more engrossing than the original wondering what would happen to the girls, will they be raped or victim of bondage, etc. If you want to watch a horror movie that has all the required elements necessary in a horror/slasher flick, this movie meets it all.Stupid young people, nudity, gore, violence, a survivor and an unpredictable and surprising plot twist, this is the movie. For those of you that want deep thought films, watch Masterpiece Theater, if you want a guilty pleasure that reminds you what a good horror/slasher flick is all about, Watch the Eli Roth series.",Hostel - Part II
218,user-153,Aimed at that lowest common denominator...,1,23 March 2010,"Having sat through this dirge, I came onto the IMDb board to see what others have thought. I was pretty surprised to find reviewers such as sgtking commenting on what a successful sequel it was. Well, allow me to retort.This movie adds absolutely nothing to a genre which is already very tired of these gruesome blood-filled, plot less ideas. I say that not just of the 'Hostel' franchise, but also 'Saw' and others like it, which are based on only one idea: to show the deaths of American teens in the most horrific way possible, whether by homicidal maniac, or in a country most American teenagers (at whom this film is squarely aimed) are entirely unfamiliar with.Sitting through Hostel 2 is a wholly pointless and irksome experience. The filmmakers have obviously tried to shoe-horn a plot into the film as an excuse to show throats being cut, faces being sawn off, etc etc. What there is of a plot does not make sense, the final scenes being frankly incapable of belief (I've watched 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' and it is more realistic) and contradict what has gone before. The acting is terrible, but then again, I struggle to think of any motivation other than the almighty dollar for an actor to appear in a film like this.Even the gore isn't very gory. And there isn't very much of it either. You sit through what seems to be hours of build up, mainly trying to focus on the beanpole in a short skirt and boots and trying not to (1) pay any attention to the dialogue and (2) wish the long and painful demise of the terrible actors/characters you are watching, there are really only 4 or 5 scenes of blood splatter, and none are actually scary. In any event, I worry to think about the kind of person who would sit through a bland and featureless film only to enjoy someone's face being torn off.Speaking as someone NOT from the USA, I can say the view of the filmmakers that Europe is about the same size Rhode Island and populated by evil, amoral cannibalistic maniacs is very very annoying. For what it's worth, the distance from Prague to Slovakia is over 600 kilometres. And 'Slovakia' is almost 50,000 square kilometres in size.",Hostel - Part II
219,TheWylde,A sequel that justifies itself...,9,10 June 2007,"Most horror sequels are entertaining but completely unnecessary. Hostel 2 justifies it's existence by elaborating on things fans were curious about and creating a very different tone while keeping the flavor of the original. Hostel bordered on ""Rated R teen comedy"" before switching gears to ""horror/thriller"". This sequel is largely a pitch black darkest of dark comedy. The movie certainly contains horror but it is in the form of individual scenes and there is even an overall sense of doom that hovers over the eventual victims that the first movie never had in it's first act. Even still, the movie is largely a dark comedy; very aware of it's own ability to create uncomfortable laughter. In my opinion, Hostel 2 is a fun movie that delivers the goods and never feels like a rehash. That's all anyone can ask of a sequel.One last bit on it's running time. While every summer blockbuster tries to come in at about 155 min. Hostel 2 comes in at a shade over 90. It's refreshing leaving a movie wanting more rather than thanking Christ the movie is finally over.",Hostel - Part II
220,mikenason,Hostel: Part II was great for what it is.,10,8 June 2007,"The movie itself (storyline wise) was exactly the same as the unfinished leak. Some of the things I noticed was BRAND NEW MUSIC. No music re-used from Hostel 1. Completely new scored music which was great. Also, the sound effects with Paxton screaming didn't sound so fake like it did in the leak. The picture quality was superb and there were scenes that I actually understood more than the leaks poor audio sounds. The key differences that just made the theatrical version blow the leak away was the sound effects. Lorna's death scene was so much more horrific because as the blade was going down her back you could actually hear the blade over the surround sound theater speakers that make you feel like it's really happening. When Beth stuck that tool in Stuart's ear when she asked for the password, blood actually came out of his ear.",Hostel - Part II

THIS IS GORE, not just cutting fake little fingers.This movie is not trying to be a classic actually it's just a homage to real classics, look for all the cameos.The performances are great because it's like watching all the lousy actresses from the 70's and 80's getting killed, wonderful!

223,gswanson17,Erosion of a genre,5,12 June 2007,"After a very successful box office turnaround with Hostel, no time was wasted in crafting a Hostel: Part Two. The trailers came out very far in advance, the film promised to be bloodier, scarier, and more intense, and the audience waited. Generally, I have to say I was disappointednot because the film didn't live up to its promisesit did, but with this little niche in the market soon to become saturated, audiences are left feeling short changed. There are no genuine scares, and the film seems much like it is torture scenes pieced together by a flimsy plot. Eli Roth knows his gore, but proves his inability to successfully craft a scene of suspense.The film is a reverse reworking of the first Hostel. The three male protagonists are replaced with female counterparts. As common horror movie knowledge goes, females are more well-liked than males, so that should scare us more as we will hopefully sympathize with the characters? This logic works to an extent, but ultimately alienates the audience from the intentions of Roth to bring us closer to the characters. We are disgusted by the first slaying, which only makes us feel bad. The subtleties make all the difference between the supporting characters. Josh (Derek Richardson) from the first Hostel had the right combination between nerd and nice guy to make him an extremely likable character. The audience would rather he and Paxton (Jay Hernandez) switch places. The character of Lorna played by Heather Matarazzo, who is already too recognizable to star in this kind of role, is too over the top, and difficult for the audience to take seriously. In Hostel: Part Two the heroine is exactly who you think it will be, and the audience is not left hung up on that dilemma.The anonymity of the first Hostel added to the scare factor. We are not sure who these people are, what is going on, or how this business works. Unfortunately Hostel: Part Two flushes all these aspects out, and methodically desensitizes us to the procedures involved in this ""business"". It evens comes to be comical, for example, when businessmen around the world are bidding on victims to torture, it really takes the edge off that anonymous masked man scare. In the first Hostel, the brief awkward contact with Josh's soon to be torturer did not reveal too much about the businessman to make him less menacing later in the film. However, in Part Two, we don't really perceive Stewart (Roger Bart) to be that threatening or believe Todd (Richard Burgi) will carry out his plans, and with each minute more of screen time they receive they become more of a person, and less menacing.The pacing and structure of the film lack in comparison to its predecessor. Paxton worries more about the whereabouts of his friends than does Beth (Lauren German). Little hints are also dropped like the jacket worn by an Oli look-alike, and the severed head text message. Part Two doesn't even give Beth time to digest the information before she too is swept up into the world of torture. There are no superfluous characters such as Kana (Jennifer Lim) from the original, and nothing to even sidestep from the very linear plot, and the 'us and them' feeling generate by Part Two.I wasn't the world's biggest advocate of the first Hostel, but when sequels are made I either like them as a radical departure from the formula such as Aliens, or a film very adherent to the original such as The Bourne Supremacy. Hostel: Part Two seems to be undecided on what it wants to be. Like the Saw films, sequels will be easy to make and will profit well in the box office, but I'm sure the series will quickly erode without a strict adherence to formula. The deterioration in quality between these two films, the first not being so great to begin with, is proof that this series will probably run itself out of business and should perhaps quite while it's winning.",Hostel - Part II
224,trevorhart,Short but sweet - the review I mean...,8,21 January 2008,"Hostel Part 2 is one of the few movies I think that surpasses its predecessor. A more fleshed out (excuse the pun) story emerges in what we all know is just a torture movie...so give it a break if you are watching for some deep ulterior motive, this isn't Bladerunner nor is it meant to be, this is pure shlockfest, metal and meat grinding gore and violence together in a blender that'd make George Romero squirm. Some great effects from Greg Nicotero and a passable, believable and easily digestible plot line....its only fault is its obvious twists in character but otherwise this movie is well made, dark, intense and overall a jolly good laugh if you tape over your wedding video with it and don't tell your wife before she invites the family around to watch it. Get out the popcorn, wipe off the edge of your seat for maximum grip and have a laugh...don't take it for anything that it's not meant to be!",Hostel - Part II

Well part two is the same exact thing but with girls instead of boys.. Nothing really happens till the end and the climax just wasn't that enthralling, and since I don't want to give it away, they really should have tried to get a better looking one.. The little twist at the end was the only surprise, the rest is by the book. I did laugh and the homage to Madamne Bathory AKA Countess Dracula, and even a little flashdance inside joke.. All in all this was a snore. If you love Gore look for Dario Argento movies.. He knows how its done..",Hostel - Part II
226,tthomas-26,They shouldn't have made this movie...,4,31 October 2007,"The first Hostel was a great film, I loved the storyline. However, Hostel wasn't one of those movies that had a storyline that could be continued into a complete movie. This movie had the same exact storyline as the first, so if you saw the first movie(which you should have if you see this one) you basically know what's going to happen. The only thing different about this one is the gore. Ah, much more gore than the first. But some of the scenes were just plain weird. Especially the sadistic one. I was expecting more from Roth and Tarantino, but then again it would have been hard to make a sequel to Hostel.So, unless if you just wanna see a lot of gore, then DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE.",Hostel - Part II

It began as if it was gonna continue the first part, but it's actually the same story with different characters from a different perspective. Personally I think is a less interesting perspective. This is not scary, not interesting, has nothing new and actually shows some sick attitudes you can't identify with. I was expecting a much better movie since the first one also has bad reviews but I liked it so much... this one stinks. I believe they could've done so much more with the plot, so it's quite disappointing. The only reason why you'd need to watch this is because you liked the first one and you want to know what this is, just like me. But I'm quite sure you'll be let down.

228,postmanvendetta,"Tasteless, Terrible, Trash",2,28 January 2008,"Before you account me as one of these sensitive people who are anti violence, sex and gore, i can assure you im not. I love movies like SAW and even the first instalment of this series but there is two things which are contained in these movies that never seems present here; substance and satisfaction.While SAW enthralled me with a thrilling storyline with elements of gorno linking the plot, this just felt like a movie aimed to disgust and thats all. My first gripe is the feature of two castrations; in my opinion one of these would be fine for shock value, but two just makes me feel like the director enjoys this perverse violence. This isn't the only case of overused gore, the killing of one of the Slovakian children is random and stupid. Unfortunately that wasn't the only random and stupid thing either; compared to the originals ending, part twos was sudden and well...terrible. It is a kick in the teeth that pretty much suggests that the rich will always triumph over the lower class of society; if you are not rich then your life is worthless. Maybe one should applaud the director for featuring such an honest ending that is closer to reality than the originals. However despite its truth hostel part twos ending feels like a step in the wrong direction from its kick-ass ancestors.To finish off the acting isn't terrible but seems incredibly distance; despite what hardships the main character goes through i feel little sympathy for her. All in all if your a fan of stupid two dimensional gorno then this will be right up your alley but if not just stick to the central street.",Hostel - Part II

Every Interview and article i read or see with Eli Roth he seems like a good guy with a huge knowledge on the horror genre so why on earth does he keep churning out bad movies? I read an article the other day and it really sold hostel 2 for me i liked the idea of following the 2 separate groups of characters the killers and the victims so i was keen to give the sequel a shot. it lacks a lot of the gore the original had and isn't very shocking at all! the first half of the film is incredibly slow and u really don't get to know the characters as well as you should. Then as soon as the half way mark is reached the General Killing commences and considering its the movies main selling point it is a huge let down! and lets face it this has been the year for terrible sequels.,Hostel - Part II

I was very surprised at the directions the movie went. there was a lot of twists and turns and it kept me interested the entire time. the suspense was tremendous and the violence was a little exaggerated but still had a real sense to it. i believe that eli roth grew as a director before making this. there was a lot more of a real feeling to the dialogue and the delivery in this sequel. the movie focused in equally on the perspective of the buyer and the victim instead of just the victim. if you are looking for this years best horror sequel, its right here.",Hostel - Part II

I thought it would be a cult classic horror movie, but man, this was horrible. Though the beginning was better on Hostel 2 then it was in Hostel 1, Hostel 1 beginning is a soft porn movie with no plot, it's there just to kill off the first 30min so they can call it a movie. Hostel 2 had a smoother beginning with no pointless sex-scenes and 'some' character development.The fact I think this movie is one of the worst is because of the special effects, and the fact that the writer obviously have no clue what he is writing about either. We are meant to believe that two guard dogs eat and bite a man into little pieces. Seriously? Are you kidding me? Were these some kind of alien-mutated-killer-dogs?And the ending is so clichéd, it's like they run out of budget and just thought about making the ending a pointless head-chopping and call it a day. PS: Good luck chopping off a head with one swing, never going to happen girl.I really don't know why Quentin Tarantino let them put his name on this either, Tarantino fans will get disappointed.Lastly, movies like Evil Dead, Braindead or Bad Taste, these movies are all good because they are meant to be cheesy and gory. They even have that ""Comedy"" in the keywords, but the fact that Hostel 1 & 2 are meant to be serious ""Horror"", ""Thriller"" movies just makes them a laughable effort at trying.

232,davidguest,Unsurprisingly as bad as the first,1,6 August 2008,"Firstly let me explain that I only ended up watching this movie because I had nothing better to do one night and my brother had rented the DVD and happened to be watching it. I was disgusted by the first installment and not because of the gore. More because of the fact it had NO PLOT, and seemed as if it had been made by two virgin teenagers who thought it'd be cool to have a film full of sex and violence. Unfortunately the very overrated and misguided Eli Roth has come up with another poor excuse for a film that leaves nothing to the imagination and is obtrusive, immature and quite frankly awful. Again Roth has abandoned any kind of plot or story, there are no motives, no character connections or emotional bonds. People die for no real reason, people get naked for no apparent reason and you watch the screen for no reason. It is my honest opinion that Hostel 2 and its predecessor are two of the worst films of all time and the fact that Roth has actually gained fans through them is disgusting. Don't watch this if you haven't seen the first, if you have seen the first, you should know better.",Hostel - Part II
233,RottenMoreno,"Increased gore, decreased storyline, a sick letdown overall",4,11 August 2007,"Eli Roth is talented, Cabin Fever, his first work, is a horror comedy I enjoy and own, there's no doubt that Roth's work has a specific crude violent mark, lots of blood and gore fill Roth's resume, specially on his latest films, Hostel and Hostel Pt. II. While most found Hostel to be a bunch of porn/torture garbage, I actually found it to be an original add to the horror genre, disliking the first half of the film and enjoying the second one, the horror one. This sequel, promised to increase the quality of its predecessor and dig more into the world of the sick people behind the torture and killing business. Sadly, the movie is not an improvement.Pt. 2 begins just after Pt. 1 ended, following Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his escape from death. Meanwhile, 3 American college students (Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo and Bijou Phillips) take a detour from their ""studying"" and end up trapped by the same twisted world that once terrorized our male characters in Hostel. Also, Pt. 2 follows two American men, who, on the other side, end up paying to get into the sick club.First off, let me express my immense disappointment of how the poor Paxton character was treated in the sequel, I would have definitely liked more from him and that is definitely a start of what ended up being a rather underwhelming sequel. Of course, the same sadist torture horror is back with Part 2, so there shouldn't be any complain with the gore and blood amount that Roth once again delivers, even do it's less this time around. However, now that we have been introduced to the twisted world of Hostel and we are used to the storyline, what Roth presents us this time is nothing more than uninteresting, he shows us how it works, and some of that information is appreciated, but most of it it's rather unnecessary, which brings me to my complaint in the film: the 2 American men.The add of those 2 characters to the film is, in my opinion, the biggest mistake made by Roth. They're both incredibly annoying; their trip is mostly distracting from the main storyline with the girls and ends up being a waste of time when it reaches its conclusion. Now, the girls are the only redeeming aspect of the film, their characters, while not being nothing out of common (like the ones in Pt.1), are entertaining and even fun to watch, which is a thumbs up for the 3 female actresses. The main interest in the film is, let's face it, the characters' doom. One of them, the blood bath, is by far the best scene in the film, sick, obviously, but also chilling and very disturbing, delivering enough blood and gore for the horror thirsty audience.Still, too much of something can go wrong, and Roth just crosses the line with a certain thing done to a male character in the film; it's just too much for the audience and it's clearly the most disgusting thing I've seen in theaters, I honestly felt like throwing up all over the couple sitting in front of me and I have no idea how the filmmakers actually skipped the NC-17 rating for this one.All in all, Hostel Pt. 2 may deliver the sadistic and the now called torture porn that the first one gave us in big amounts, but stays stuck in the same level as in the first one, the only difference is that we've seen this before, but with male characters, which decreases the originality of the film. Pt. 2 was going well, until it hits its doom near the end, with those 2 American men destroying my attention on the movie. However, the film may still stand for fans of the first one and for a couple of good scenes, it just didn't work out for me, as it ended up being more bad than good; hopefully Roth will leave the Hostel franchise and focus on something else to amplify his disturbing talent.",Hostel - Part II
234,kute_lokita,This was TORTURE,1,1 June 2007,"This is a very cheesy, obnoxious, and predictable movie. Three American girls follow a young woman to Slovakia, but later find themselves being kidnapped and perhaps murdered.This film lacked character development, motivation, and overall uniqueness. I had a huge problem with some of the scenes in the film. For example, the scene where the woman is bathing in blood; it could definitely had been shorter if they would have cut down the men lighting up the candles. Also, when Stuart (Roger Bart) first untied Beth (Lauren German) but then re-tied her again. It made absolutely no sense. In addition, I believe that the entire begin was okay where we thought Paxton (Jay Hernandez) was trapped and killed, that is until he woke up next to a young woman (who by the way serves absolutely no purpose to the movie) and got killed for good.Another issue that I had with this movie was how predictable it was. The young American women were so naïve that of course we felt they had to be killed. Like, Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), didn't your mother ever tell you not to go alone with strangers? Again too pathetic. I say, don't waste your money, time, or effort to watch this film, you would truly be disappointed.",Hostel - Part II
235,garissonangel,Torture Corn,2,13 May 2009,"It's a great pity that the truly horrific elements of this film are concerned with production values rather than events. The script is appalling, and the performances lack-lustre at best, the torture scenes are banal and the assault of stereotypical characters, locations etc. just get on your nerves after a while. I think if I was Slovakian I might tie Ely Roth up in a cellar outside Bratislava and force him to retract his xenophobia.Hostel part2 is just not nasty, scary, unsettling, disturbing or interesting in any way at all. Compared to similar 'Torture Porn' offerings such as the ingenious Five Across the Eyes, Wolfcreek, even the Saw series, this is a poor outing. Ending on a comedy note is hardly a good idea either. Honestly I saw Alien 3 on TV afterwards and I found that scarier.Avoid this film, not because it will offend your sensibilities, but because it will simply be a waste of your time.",Hostel - Part II
236,BlackHawk847,For Hostel Fans,9,17 June 2007,"Going into this film I didn't really know what to expect, but after the first five minutes I was pleasantly surprised how the movie started. Now after the first five minutes the movie seems to start slowing down, but only to develop the characters like in the first movie for example. There are three main girl characters as there were 3 main male characters in the first so there are similarities which is nice. The girls in there roles do a decent job for a horror movie especially Lauren German who gets the most screen time, but for good reason as she isn't the typical horror damsel in distress. Another thing I've always liked about this series is the fact the majority of the characters are realistic and are like normal people in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now a key difference in this movie compared to the first is it shows us what the buyers who are going to kill these people are like and it's fun to watch how the act before and after because it was something just touched upon in the first movie that was greatly satisfying to watch. Now for all you gore lovers, Hostel: Part II will not disappoint at all. You will see a sadistic girl cutting another one hanging upside down having an orgasm to what she is doing which is only the beginning and all I'll tell you. The things that happen in Hostel Part II need to be experienced to have any effect at all on you and that is basically why if you enjoyed Hostel you'll probably end up liking Hostel Part II just as much as I did.",Hostel - Part II

There is not much you can say about this film without sounding entirely negative, it's the horror equivalent of ""meet the spartans"", setup/gag/setup/gag etc etc in a lowbrow derivative fashion. Excessive gore can and does work in the right setup, and much like the vfx in blockbusters, it works as long as it's augmenting the narrative not Replacing it.There is sadism in spades that is meant to shock you, meant to repulse you and thats fine, but thats it,, it's a one trick pony, and a lame one at that.Anyone could sit in a room and think up the most horrifying ways of dispatching each other, and frequently many 9yr olds do, in an attempt to gross each other out, and that pretty much sums up this movie, childish and silly.",Hostel - Part II
238,wdrr,Another Crap Film From Eli Roth,1,10 June 2007,"I can sum up this movie in one word... terrible! Yet another pile of dung from Eli Roth. He is 2 for 3 now. Cabin Fever was a complete turd (don't know why people claimed to love it) so I wasn't expecting much when I went to see the first Hostel.The first Hostel had problems but there were more moments of brilliance than expected. It was a great idea, a great horror gimmick, and had an overall great delivery. That being said, it was also contrived, formula, and had some moments of complete, ""What were you thinking?"" I actually began to believe that Eli Roth might have some merit in Hollywood. Was I ever wrong! Hostel 2 strips away all the moments of brilliance from the first movie and leaves us with a festering dung pile of mushroom invigorated camel turd. Anything that was even remotely appealing about the first film vaporizes into extreme unintelligent gayness very similar to the poor style of Robert Rodriguez. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but when it smells this bad, I would prefer Eli Roth go ""Flatter"" himself in a closet as opposed to making the rest of us suffer.This is certainly a movie you can miss.",Hostel - Part II
239,mbajnr,Bunch of arse,3,23 October 2007,"It's difficult to comment on this film without making reference to Eli Roth's other works. I did like Cabin Fever. I thought it was successful in it's revision of old horror clichés and i quite enjoyed the way the 'teen humour' was balanced with ultimate futility.Hostel part one had an interesting premise. Murder and cruelty as part of an entertainment experience. Disappointingly, Roth seemed more interested in showing a few naked girls and demonstrating the levels of violence he's willing to show in his films, than exploring anything even remotely resembling psychology. What transpired was pretty standard teen horror/thriller.Hostel 2 doesn't start off particularly well. The first scene is clichéd and pointless. In fact, where the first film began in a comparatively novel way, this film merely repeats it, with far less menace. In fact the whole film is entirely unremarkable, to the point that it comes across that maybe Roth decided to make this film because he thought of some extra scenes of violence that he forgot to include in the first film. The acting is, well, unsatisfactory. The script is poor, and the European stereotyping is insulting in it's obviousness.The one hope of redemption comes when you begin to see the workings of the black dog gang. This becomes focused on two American characters. 'Ah', you think, 'maybe the film is this bland because all of the effort went into some cunning character examination, and that we'll see the first film, but from the 'other side', which would, you think, at least fit in with Roth's apparent obsession with violence.Nope. That plot strand meanders ludicrously and in the end becomes as much a joke as the rest of the film.So in summary. This film isn't shocking. It's not funny. It's not clever. It's not interesting. It's actually a big over-hyped waste of everyone's time. Maybe Roth found his niche with the 30 second trailer in Grindhouse, because that seems to be the appropriate duration for the material of his recent efforts. Good to see he's got a Steven King plot for his next movie. Bet that'll be good",Hostel - Part II
240,Saving_Private_Nyan,you know what this movie is supposed to be like,6,24 July 2010,"for those who giving this movie 1s just because its gory,you know what this movie is supposed to be like.if you go to this movie expecting to see some nice guy falling in love with a pretty girl,you're stupid.hostel movies are horror movies,if you don't like them then simply don't watch them first off,i actually liked this movie better than the first one.cause this time they tried to do something with the characters,they tried to give some meaning to the plot make people think about human emotions.something that hostel 1 lacked which had excessive nudity and dumb characters.sometimes it fails miserably but sometimes it works.that guy freaking out after seeing blood and changing his mind about torturing the girl,i liked it.but his nice ass type friend who didn't wanna torture anyone ends up trying to rape a girl just because she said something that could hurt his ego,well that wasn't realistic.the last few scenes felt forced.and there wasn't enough torture.and the gum kids were unnecessary. my rating-6/10",Hostel - Part II
241,garyb79,More garbage from Eli Roth,1,17 March 2008,"I saw the first Hostel movie and thought it was just bland tripe with poor acting and characters you couldn't care less about.I heard through the grapevine that Hostel II was an improvement from the 1st so I was curious to see if it was the movie that the first one should have been.how wrong I was.What we're given is more or less a complete re-working of the first film. the only difference I could spot was that the 3 main characters are females this time around.Queue the bad acting, pathetic dialogue, clichéd characters with no depths, and what do you get? another bad movie courtesy of Eli Roth.Why Tarantino decides to use his name for these awful movies is anyone's guess. Perhaps he thinks the Hostel movies are America's answer to the amazing Australian movie ""Wolf Creek"" (which, by the way, is one of Tarantino's favourite Horror movies of all time). If this is what he thinks, he couldn't be more wrong.I can safely say this is the first, and so far only, DVD that I've had to skip through scenes to see what happens. Very disappointing.I can also safely say I will never watch another movie that has Eli Roth's name in the credits.",Hostel - Part II
242,astroass34,What?,1,10 January 2009,"Are you serious? This movie sucked worse than the first one- and the first one was a hefty sack of crap. Eli Roth should commit suicide after the horrible movies he has made. Hostel: an hour of a really bad dark rip off of ""Euro Trip"" followed by 8 minutes of actual horror, followed by more crap. How the hell do people find Hostel a decent movie? What a boring set of films. These are both absolutely horrible movies with no thought put into them whatsoever. I love the morons who think they are good movies- glad to see you guys have an IQ of about 30... Jesus... It's bad enough we have horrible filmmakers like Eli Roth creating a bunch of crap he calls movies, but we have people out there who actually like his movies...

243,willowmagic3,Disappointment to America and an Embarrassment to Roth,1,9 June 2007,"I ask myself now why I even went to see this movie. I hated the original and thought it was just plain out dumb but I decided to spent $10 bucks to try this charade all over again. Hostel 2 is taking a step in US filmography by putting just women onto the chopping block this time around. This could've have great potential for a smart storyline and scriptwriting but it failed miserably. What was so disappointing about this movie was how it had absolutely no point and went nowhere. It's one thing to knock off people one by one while maintaining some sort of plot but Hostel 2 (like the original) brutally murders off people with no reasoning and a point to follow along. Along with the typical Hollywood ""shock"" ending and blood splattered randomly in huge concentrations Hostel Part II fails to deliver in too many ways. Eli Roth should be ashamed for creating another flop.",Hostel - Part II
244,hersh-mail,Now that was pretty bad...,3,9 October 2007,"An unnecessary re-hash of the original which was already bad. Plot-hole after plot-hole, improbable situations leading only to an anti-climax and an embarrassing ending, this turkey is cold meat instead of gushing hot blood it would have liked to pretend. I thought that the first one was not remarkable, but kind of wished that Mr Roth would've learned for the second. Instead, i just can't comprehend the need for this... ""sequel""...For starters, forget the scenario, there isn't one. I suppose that as the first one set the scene, we needn't embarrass ourselves with a convoluted script, right ? OK, let's assume so (but it doesn't make it right). So this time, let's just introduce the necessary brain-dead bunch, and get to the nasty parts as soon as possible, right ? OK, let's assume i could buy that (but this is already stretching it a bit too far). So we get to meet the girls, don't learn anything about them (except they're brain-dead alright), so let's get to the immoral stuff already, right ? Erm, no. In the quest for going even further, Mr Roth has crossed the line of ridicule, and as such the movie has nothing left ; no script, no characters worthy of existence, and no horror, let alone gore.He however decides to show a bit more of the machinery of this secret society ; we see the clichéd-to-death mean faces of those who pull he strings, sunglasses and expensive suits obliged, sipping beverages on a town café's terrace, and receiving occasionally a decapitated head in a box delivered by a courier, just as the dude at the next table might get his soda. The most natural thing in the world you might say. Of course he lives in a manor, filled with everything of exquisite taste, art galore. Their men are everywhere. We get the feeling they control the town. In fact i got the impression that they might even control the whole country. OK so they're powerful. So how come all the convoluted plans to trap the girls ? Which, as they never work as planned (i imagine i should've felt for the girls at these moments, but was too amazed by these sloppy amateurs), makes me feel very embarrassed for an organization of that size. I mean, they control *everything*, and they had to empty a whole SPA of people in the middle of a day so that their men can come to capture the girl left alone and in a bathrobe, who, without any effort at all just jumps over the fence and escapes ? And this is just one example but everything is just as air-headed (i could just go on and on), suffice to say the whole film follows this same logic : no logic at all.So the nasty stuff then ? What could be morally worse than torturing people and then killing them (so as to surpass the first film) ? Mr Roth must've thought that he would surely get there by killing a child for no reason (and another example of a scene which has no reason to exist, it's just there so as to shock, and even there it fails), and making someone bathe in blood (mixing sex and death in a literal sense). Wow. And that's that. The rest is some sloppy gore hacks that aren't even as good as in the first one. Mix into that the two ridiculous ""clients"" (the torturers), the ridiculous ""twists"" of the story, and a ridiculous ending, and you've got yourself a sorry-ass ridiculous wanna-be hardcore flop. But still not ridiculous enough to be actually funny, just lame.You want some good fun, avoid this one and watch Planet Terror another time...3* out of 10",Hostel - Part II
245,seishino,An exquisitely filmed but ultimately hollow torture flick,7,21 June 2007,"Hostel II is an interesting take on this suddenly re-hot genre, that avoids all of the traditional pitfalls yet somehow manages to come off as a bit flat.For one, basically all of the characters are driven by complications and good acting. No matter how insignificant the character, you get a constant flow of interesting interactions and character quirks going on between them. And the general caliber of acting is much higher than others in similar genres.Similarly, none of the characters ever do things that can be considered foolish. They all behave believably for people in some extremely not-nice situations. At no point does one get the sense that they're watching movie characters who are simply advancing the plot.The pacing, too, moves at a leisurely but good build, taking its time to indulge in side stories and character development which only serves to make the character's ultimate demise that much more tragic.And all of this serves to make the 'sploitation bits all the more shocking. And shocking they can be... the pacing of bits which make you sit back and say ""That was 'horrible'"" is quite good, and seem to find just the right balance to make the viewer shocked and appalled at the next bit of human tragedy splayed across the screen.Unfortunately, the movie never moves beyond its exploitive roots. It uses good techniques not seen in other films of this genre to build attachment to characters, to build the sense of impending dread, and to make the doom and dread all that more bleak. But ultimately, none of this is in service of any higher or more interesting narrative. You're clearly watching a ""giggle and cringe at the guts on the screen"" movie. A very well filmed gut-filled film, but one without a lot of real merit on its own.Unfortunately for a movie that starts out strong and builds throughout the middle, the ending is quite weak and unsatisfying. I won't give it away, but needless to say it ends abruptly without resolving (or even addressing) a lot of the underlying issues which the film seemed to be building towards.All-in-all, Hostel 2 is what it is... a hollow torture movie made exquisitely well by a skilled director and talented cast, but a hollow torture movie nonetheless.",Hostel - Part II

Actually I think Hostel: Part II was better than Hostel, because the first movie was more like a typical teen slasher. This one actually had a couple of unpleasant scenes, and was a tad more unpredictable.However I completely understand and sympathize with offended Slovakians, because the country is depicted in an uneducated and ignorant way.

I will start by stating that I am a huge Eli Roth fan, so, yes, I may be a bit biased.I enjoyed this sequel to the shocking first movie. I thought the way Roth set up the first half of this movie was concurrent to what was a about to unfold. It wasn't quite as awfully shocking as the first, though there are moments where many people will cringe. Such as the first, the gore factor is present and there are many ""snufflike"" scenes that make up what exactly makes this series so entertaining to the ultra-violent film buff.No, this isn't an Oscar winning film, and I feel Roth set out to do exactly what he does: shock people. I believe Roth is not trying to make a movie with the best plot or dialogue. He simply is doing what he does best. I personally enjoyed this film and was pleasantly amused by the ending.I say it's worth a view, especially if you have a significant other that is not expecting torture & brutal violence.

251,shifty1032231,Sort of Better than Hostel But Nothing Great,5,8 June 2007,"I'm gonna try not to give away spoilers. I hope this will be the last Hostel even though Eli Roth has confirmed it because after this on then there will be nowhere else to go with the story. The movie I felt in either liking or hating it was mixed. There are some good parts especially with the two American clients. Their journey is more fascinating than the girls because their characters are crafted more carefully and more fully. You really could not like the girls because Roth creates the typical stereotype girls. Fortunately Landa is the better of them all for being wholesome but sadly she falls into the stereotypes. There is the girl who is drunk and slutty resembling a typical portrayal of a sorority girl, the protagonist rich girl who is more well meaning than she can become, and again as I said the wholesome girl who doesn't drink and writes in her journal. The inner workings of the Elite Hunting club are interesting to a level. The owner of elite hunting to me really shows no morality and is amoral. He prefers business over the people who kills and clients. The deaths are not full of torture as the first film (the first murder is disturbing to me) so basically blood thirsty gore fans will be disappointed. I hated how Roth doesn't develop the women even though he tries to by allowing time until the girls reach the factory. The ending well I mean the very ending right before the credits made the movie seem more pathetic. I liked the idea of the twist but the finale just disappointed me. Roth should of left it open ended. Roth does score a important point here and that is the role of music in the film. As the American clients arrive and get ready for their pleasure the operatic music was just chilling. That same effect happened for me in Halloween. Even if a movie like hostel can be sort of bad but has a great scene involving chilling music then that is a plus. Its a mixed response to me. There are some good parts and a lot of bad parts and I hope that can clear up why I liked it or I hated it. Oh yea I thought Paxton's part at the beginning could of developed into something better for the rest of the film rather than show a way to introduce the owner of Elite Hunting.",Hostel - Part II

The point I think people are missing is this isn't really supposed to be a plot driven piece at all, it's almost a homage to low budget B-horror movies. The first Hostel movie did a good job in what it set out to do. However, Hostel 2 more then surpasses it, as it does not take itself as seriously as the first film, which in turn is part of the film's genius. Between a game of soccer with a severed head, a castration that will make most guys squirm with mentally induced pain in their seats, and many other varying types of gore Hostel 2 delivers on all fronts.

Eeeccckk!..... ..But I have never turned off one of their movies. Last night I starting watching Hostel 2 ( out of boredom..Hostel 1 sucked too) and when it came to the scene where Heather M. was being hung upside down and then gutted so a naked woman could bath in her blood below...I immediately stopped watching and was totally disgusted! If this is where horror movies are headed courtesy of the Hostel and Saw films.. I have to say a big no thanks to horror movies! I had to think why this scene bothered me so much... I think it was because of the sadistic nature of it....it really was like a snuff film... it was too real... and too sick!..If you watched this movie and liked it.. you should should probably see a psychologist! and I am really not joking when I say that.

254,Homer_J_Sherman,"gory yes, but scary no",4,9 June 2007,"I didn't really like Hostel 1, but I tend to see almost every horror movie that comes out, as horror in general tends to be more stylish than other genres. Hostel 2 is not really better or worse than Hostel 1, but like the original it has a slow opening sans gore, then a brutishly gory last act that is not really scary as much as it is intentionally over-the-top graphic. To me, that's the problem with the movie, as well as with director Eli Roth's style. I don't hate his work, but I don't find it that funny, which is what I think he hopes for by crafting such uninhibited gruesomeness--challenging us to laugh uncomfortably at the sickness of human nature as well as the fragility of our bodies--it's a kind of extreme gallows humor. For me though, it's not really scary. It''s unpleasant, of course, because what somewhat sane person is really comfortable watching intense mutilation? It seems the intended appeal of the movie is to titillate gore-fans, who are kind of a cliquish segment of movie lovers. The more offensive the movie, the more ""bad taste"" it has, the more ""credibility"" is has. But the problem with Hostel 2 for me, is that the gore comes a little too late, and is a little too crude without being suspenseful (the other key component of horror, if you ask me). Overall, the movie feels like it could've worked better as a short movie, without the flat, drawn-out buildup. The torture scenes are really the ""heart"" of the movie, but I thought even they had a weak pulse. But...if you like that kind of stuff then, well, you like it.

255,pleasendlost,Muddled,6,13 January 2008,"This sequel was a disappointment.We learn more about the workings of Elite Hunting Club, but this serves no purpose. There is a very inventive torture/murder scene in the first third of the movie, very long and played out Ingrid Pitt tribute, but after that, only random snatches of gore.The three girls are totally 2D, the only bearable one was rich lesbian Beth. Bijou Phillips's character was like someone who failed an audition for Clueless! The geeky one doesn't bear talking about.The two American clients...unbelievable. Why, and how, could two guys like that get involved with EHC? Oh, we were wrong about them, the nervous one was really the psycho! The fact that EHC makes all it's members commit a murder and get tattooed is good enough to show that they keep their existence secret, but what about all the hangers-on, the villagers and visitors who didn't get kidnapped? You couldn't have a production line of kidnapped tourists like that, about 40 a week, without the authorities coming calling.It's details like this that spoil the movie. They whack the geek over the head then watch her float face down in the river - I thought they were meant to keep the merchandise alive? And the ending - completely cut off any tension there may have been in an instant. Why didn't the boss just accept the payment and kill her? And beheading his daughter? For one, that girl couldn't have swung a big axe like that and knocked her head off in one. Secondly, surely Sasha would have been mad as hell and come looking for her?

256,nzxt,Tasteless !,2,26 September 2007,"The first ""Hostel"" reminded me about the backpacking culture, like when I myself was on the train from Prague to Bratislava 2 years ago. As I was on my own, I asked two American guys who where seated to join them in their compartment. Of course, they where at first hesitant to the company of a foreigner but accepted me nonetheless. The asked me if I came from Russia, as they had never heard any Scandinavian garbling before. This really makes up what I think about American mentality; frightened to terrorists, fascists, Nazis, communists and so on. The violence in ""Hostel"" was truly shocking but ironic as well, something that the sequel truly has lost. Why did they add two American pleasure hunters as antagonists instead of some eastern European guys? This movie is a sick tribute to the Hungarians virgin bloodsucker; Elisabeth Barthomy. There's even a message of morality by the end that goes nowhere, except for the castration-scene. Eli Roth has in fact made it better than his own favorite flick; ""Cannibal Holocaust"". For an another sequel, I could think of a storyline where two American reporters become inspired by the rumors of mystic disappearance's and travel to the infamous hostel. In the part of one of the reporters, you could add Tarantino as he often stars in his own movies. It could be very funny to watch him pull off his shitty gags whilst he gets chopped up bit for bit....",Hostel - Part II

But the director thinks that ""ANY PERSON"" is capable and will commit torture if in a place where their is no ""law"". Can you see Gaundi burning out the eye of a British solider? while laughing with delight? The director seem to think that the movie mirrors Bush and his ""Buddies"", because people are being killed in the war and we are not allowed to see them die, or being killed. I feel this movie Mirrors the main problem with our society today. We only want to see, think and feel bad about life. Just as easy to make movies about Love, honor, compassion, and brotherhood, we could see the world in a positive light. But in that case, better not see this movie. As for Bush, maybe not the best apple in the barrel, but after seeing this movie, better him then Mr Roth.",Hostel - Part II

Manny people seem to be bashing this movie because of its lack of originality but i didn't seem to mind since i am a fan of predictable movies (mainly exploitation and 80's slashers). one thing i liked about this movie (apart from the gore) was that fact that it explained a lot more than the fist, which is expected in a sequel i spose. Sure the movie is predictable and contains enough gore to make an average cinema goer sick but what do you really expect from a movie called hostel 2. all i can say is stop listening to all the complaining, go see this movie and switch ya brain off for 95 mins its worth it.",Hostel - Part II
260,slicktones2000,Sequel Completely Ruins What Worked Well in First HOSTEL,3,21 June 2007,"The first HOSTEL film was not a flawless piece of movie-making, but DID employ a very fresh, arguably brilliant idea--an angle we hadn't seen before; and the plausibility of this idea, the fact that such events, as horribly evil as they were portrayed, were not difficult to fathom in the real world in which we live, gave the first HOSTEL a rather profound and thought-provoking subtext and theme upon which to build a film that haunted the viewer long past seeing it in the theater. For most of us seasoned film buffs, along with most ANYONE who lives in our highly desensitized, cynical society, it takes a lot to truly SHOCK; but it must be said that Eli Roth's first Hostel had some truly shocking moments, as well as some penetrating insights: for example, the notion that sport killing of human beings is a logical, albeit twisted and disturbing extension of sexual perversion and, in a broader sense, basic cultural taboos...the implication being that it is a boundary that is inevitably going to be broken and explored, for torture and murder reflect an (unflattering yet) essential component of human nature: the capacity to do horrible things to other human beings, devoid of any sense of moral responsibility. While Hostel did not hit a cinematic home run, it suggested that its creator, despite having only the mostly lame Cabin Fever as a previous feather in his cap at that point, was a highly intelligent, young auteur with the potential to do some great things in the future. One actually believed, for a moment there, that Eli Roth might indeed deserve, on artistic terms, the endorsement by and ostensible affiliation with Quentin Tarantino which provided such a commercial boost to the first Hostel installment. The first Hostel started out as just another pedestrian teen slasher flick, but rallied in the second and third act to be a truly compelling piece of work, with a revenge ending that was immensely satisfying. As you might imagine, I am setting you up to tell you that the sequel, Hostel Part II, is a massive disappointment. Before I do this, I want to point out the things that were great about the first one:1. Premise/Concept: never done before, a brilliant and, sadly, plausible idea. 2. Setting: the scene when the trio of horny backpacking males arrives, via train, in Slovakia, and finds themselves surrounded by a drab, eerily deserted industrial landscape, is a wonderful moment...it perfectly sets the tone for what is to come. The scene is genuinely chilling. 3. Casting: the two Slovakian girls, who ultimately prove to be remorseless monsters, were wonderful. Beautiful, sexy, and in the end, downright evil. The girls needed to be very beautiful in order to make the plot believable, and the casting delivered. Also, the creepy man on the train, who we are lulled into thinking is a good guy...only to find out that he is indeed a twisted, evil torturer...was brilliantly cast. 4. Shock and awe: The first film viscerally explores the nature of torture, with compelling and shocking results. These images are disturbing, and they stay with the viewer long after the film. 5. Pay-off: the plot pays off big-time. Roth's script provides a riveting and satisfying third act, true to the tone of the first two, but also full of surprises. So now, let me express my disappointment with Hostel Part II. The sequel has NONE OF THE QUALITIES I MENTIONED. In fact, it serves only to cheapen and negate the brilliance of the first film, much as the Ring sequel did, by explaining and thus trivializing/neutralizing matters and details that required no explanation, such as the inner workings of the torture club. Also, the second film suffers a tremendous lack of imagination--it's a complete retread of the original plot. Why? Why? Why, Eli? There are so many creative directions in which the original concept could have been spun. How about a change of location...an equally horrifying, but totally new location and set-up? I ASSUMED that, at the very least, the sequel would offer a new venue, as opposed to just bringing in some fresh meat to the SAME HOSTEL IN SLOVAKIA. Are you kidding? Apparently Roth WAS kidding, because rather than elicit discomfort over truly gruesome scenarios, as he did so well in the first, all the sequel does is make you want to laugh. You laugh because everything is just downright absurd. Not scary, not thought-provoking...not even gory. Just absurd. And pretty damn stupid. Stupid characters, stupid plot, stupid character reversals (the ones in the first film were clever and unexpected), stupid twists that you see coming a mile away.The only reason I give this terrible sequel 3 out of 10 stars is because, despite the movie being a derivative piece of junk, I still have a place in my cinematic heart for the first Hostel, which I maintain was a fresh piece of film-making; and the sequel, despite its myriad flaws, unsympathetic characters and utter lack of storytelling inspiration, does manage to capture some of the visual style of the original. That's the only good thing I can say about it. You bummed me out, Eli. If that was the best you could come up with, script-wise, you should have walked away after the first film and tackled something altogether new. The Hostel II script stunk big-time, as if it was hammered out over a weekend. And next time, if you're going to gratuitously snip a guy's penis and balls off, at least make that penis and balls look remotely real.",Hostel - Part II

Take the gore away, this was simply a bad film. Add in this sick snuff extras and what you have is a recipe for people with mental health issues to indulge themselves.If you seriously enjoyed this movie, fact is you are NOT a normal healthy human. There is something wrong with you.What can I actually say about the movie? Nothing, because this movie deserves nothing. This new breed of snuff films are simply disgusting and despicable geared towards sick people. Sad that in the world today there are so many people that find these enjoyable. I remember at least back in the 1970s when a film like ""I spit on your grave"" came out, it was hardly noticed. I can say though that a good point to show how bad this is, watch the movie 8MM which deals with the production of a snuff film in a compelling and serious manner.In short this is just a horrible waste of time. When you consider that there is so much good quality entertainment, why waste time out of your life on this trash.

I thought that this would have been better than the the first one, but it was not. There was too much time spent dancing even though that was the plot. There should have been much more killings, is it because they were woman? because I would love to be in their shoes and to die in the worst possible way! It did not have edge that I was hoping for, I was expecting much more from Quinton. Thumbs up to him and his crew because he really gets thing done when he wants to, but this time was just average. Even 'From Dusk Til Dawn' was over the top, I rated it '10' It had everything that kept me on the edge of my seat, and I left the Cenima feeling satisfied.

All the first one was was murder and porn. Too much porn if you ask me. This one cut down on that by about 85% and I think the only reason people don't like it was that they were perhaps expecting to pleasure themselves during it like that first one.I like the plot better in this one as well. It wasn't some stupid horny bastard teenage boys that I cared nothing about. All they wanted was to get laid in the first movie so right then you know the quality of the movie was going to suck. At least this one was a bit more logical.3 girls are in Europe studying abroad taking an art class, and one of the models they drew convinces them to go to Slovakia with her because of the nice hot springs. The stay at a youth hostel, you can obviously tell it's suspicious, and they even show you how the girls are bid on. It's kinda interesting. The ending wasn't as stupid as most are saying.Everyone that's dissing this movie liked the first one so much, so their opinions are obviously that of posers. ""Whatever my friends/other people say I will agree with 100% and not have an opinion of my own."" In conclusion, just see it.

We know what happens in Slovakia, and now we get to see how the victims are chosen and prepared for the customers. To say that it's the same movie completely misses the point. To show the girls going through something drastically different than the boys would compromise the integrity of the first film. Part II adds so much to the complete story...expanding the scope of the operation (who know that practically the whole town was in on it), showing the improvements at the factory (considering what happened at the end of Part I) and exploring the life and motivations of people that would bid for the chance to torture and kill another person. The scariest part of this film is that Richard Burgi and Roger Bart (Todd & Stuart) don't play their parts as psychos...they are just presumably wealthy guys going after the next thrill of a lifetime. No mythical demons, the undead or atomic mutants...the bad people are in fact ordinary people.",Hostel - Part II

The acting is not that god,like in the first one. It's simply average. Don't expect nothing plus. None of these actors gonna get a nomination for this film.

They live in LA, a place I once resided, that is riddled with violence and one of our countries highest murder rates. It makes me wonder what Tarantino will be remembered for when he is in the grave. Oh, yeah, he's that guy who made over the top violent bloody movies and influenced a bloody violent country, to adopt that normal forms of murder, can be improved upon. That is what serial killers do, the kill is no longer gratifying for them, so they get baser and baser in their acts in order to regain the thrilling feeling they got the first time they did it.

270,janoico,Comment made of spoilers,10,2 June 2007,"--Warning, if you are looking for a thrilling experience before watching the movie for the first time, DO NOT read this, it is a pure spoiling thing-- As a Slovakian myself, when I saw the first Hostel, I felt somehow... you know... unsure... like, hey man, SK is not like that! Well it all changed after this sequel! Most of all it is an important movie. Let me tell you why: Finally there is a movie that explains all the dangers of messing around with anything Slovakian! (after ""Hostel part one"". some said: ""it shows SK in bad light"", others were like; ""any advertisement is good for tourism"" - well I say: hell with tourism- we are talking about movies, not promoting your egos or smt). And therefore it is very educative. All the audience will be informed that all you have to do to get to Slovakia, is to switch in Prague. It will be also explained, SK is not Bosnia and Hercegovina and there have not been any trouble for like 50 years or so. Then it will be shown, there is a party every night and the girls... oh god, they are hot! (shame Vera Jordanova- Axelle delivered all her lines in Bulgarian). It is also very useful that the audience is warned about the gypsy gangs (wonder why they speak Czech). Furthermore audience can be assured, in SK people are aware of American culture -they watch Pulp Fiction in Russian- here is probably the only small mistake in the movie- after being occupied by Russian army from 1968 to 1989, the natives would probably choose another language. I was also extremely happy that an old habit of washing in blood was brought up again- it is very good for your skin. So, to sum it up: DO GO and see the movie and DO NOT GO to Slovakia or you will be bothered by the Italians on the train, seduced by a hot Bulgarian chick, robbed by Czech gypsies, kidnapped by some ugly Slovakians, offered to fat, rich and odd people all around the globe (including some Japanese- man, you know how good Asians are in torturing), bought by two American husbands of Desperate Housewives (yeah there was something creepy behind the TV show- if Susan only knew what happened to Karl...)... and finally, if you still insist and go... you better be really rich or you get your head chopped of! Oh yes all of these might happen. Imagine what are we capable of, when a former Minister of culture (Milan Knazko - Sasha) shoot little gypsies without a moment of hesitation. The last things: a) I believe, the most funny thing about ""Hostel"" were the creators going to Iceland to apologize they pictured Icelandians as ""drunken sex maniac."" - luckily all the Eastern Europeans were pictured realistically b) But seriously, and I mean it, the movie is funny time to time but killing is gruesome... though a little bit less than in part I.",Hostel - Part II
271,Zan-tastic,Eli Roth should have quit while he was ahead,1,3 July 2007,"Albeit, I was sort of ""talked into"" going to see the first Hostel, but I wasn't disappointed. The movie was, as I saw it, graphic, mysterious, and overall extremely interesting. I left satisfied.Then, I hear rumors that a Hostel Part II is being made, and the first thought to come to my mind is: ""Exactly how does one make a sequel to such a film?"" Given the nature of the first film, all major plot points seemed to be covered, leaving, in my mind, nothing to expand upon. I saw Hostel II for the sole purpose of answering the aforementioned question. The answer I got wasn't one I was happy with. They didn't improve upon the first film, they largely recycled it.If I could sum up this movie in one word, it would be ""predictable."" The best parts of the first movie were retooled (perhaps ""regurgitated"" is a better word?) and used in this one, so naturally, we saw much of it coming. Most of the film seemed like they just removed the three boys from the first film and substituted three girls and expected no one to know the difference. Beyond that, the film is filled with many needless clichés, all of which I predicted as the film wore on (such as the survivor of the first film departing this mortal coil within the first fifteen minutes, the ""Tough-Talker"" and the ""Timid Mouse"" torturers both having last-minute changes of heart, and the ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" ending, which you could tell was going to happen from the first few times the characters go on and on about how much money the character of ""Beth"" has).If you can work your way past the clichés, then you have to work your way through the unnecessary scenes, all of which left me with more questions than I had answers for (such as --and this one tops my list-- ""WHY was that inane scene with the game of soccer using ""Axell's"" head even IN this film?"").In conclusion, even though the torture scenes were as good as I expected, but cut far too short (presumably for the allowance of nude females, which in my opinion should be the icing on the cake, and not replace the cake itself), I would consider this movie a waste of my money, but not of my time. It is overall as interesting as the first (it should be, at least, with much of the first script being found in this one), but not worth the $7 to $10 one would have to shell out in theaters. I'd call this movie ""rent-worthy,"" and perhaps even worth a purchase, but only if found in the ""reduced price"" bin.",Hostel - Part II

273,SilentHylian,Predictable and Derivative,3,11 June 2007,"Originally, I couldn't decide if it was necessary to see this sequel in the theaters, or if I could just put it on my queue in a couple of months. I had genuinely been surprised by how much I liked the original, after Roth's dismal freshman outing, Cabin Fever. It was director Roth's statements to the press about how shocking the film's ending would be that finally forced my decision. For a filmmaker to have that kind of confidence, I'd imagined he was actually able to cook up something at least as original as his initial premise of the first film. Instead he retreaded territory that's familiar to anyone who's seen I Spit On Your Grave. If the studio responsible for Hostel 2 at least wants a better critical response, I'd recommend they prevent Roth from doing any more publicity rounds - neither the film nor the ending live up to all his braggadocio.Hostel 2 isn't awful, it's just another run-of-the-mill modern horror movie, complete with all the hallmarks we've come to expect since the late 1990s: stereotypically one-dimensional characters, wooden acting, terrible dialogue, buckets of blood, and lots of gratuitous nudity. Roth attempts to up the ante with a storyline that claims to expose the dark, secret pinings of wealthy (and usually American) business men (and now women, too!). The problem with this is the believability of the premise: while Roth sufficiently addresses their bloodlust, the target of it is what's questionable. Are these people really as likely to kill the young women in the film, as they are to perpetrate more directly sexual crimes? Quite possibly, but if so, it's never addressed. Regardless, the viewer is, of course, expected to not only accept this premise unconditionally, but assume their condition is epidemic, as seen in montage during one of the film's more silly moments.It's this sort of lack of supporting detail that relegates Hostel 2 to the world of predictable and disappointing sequels. Coming from a member of the equally-hyped Splat Pack, at least this viewer was expecting more.",Hostel - Part II

This film, however, wasn't an attempt to redo or outdo the first. Sure, there were more young, naive and almost obnoxiously American college kids running around Eastern Europe getting themselves into situations that they were more or less asking to be in, and there were some extremely unsettling scenes, but for the most-part, this movie is a fresh take on the whole scenario. I may have gone into it with low expectations, but there were several engaging scenes that any fan of film could appreciate; and unlike other gore flicks, this one followed its predecessor in focusing less on sadistic voyeurism and more on the motivation behind the villains. Which is more than I can say for most blood and guts horror films. A good follow-up, even if it wasn't necessary, and well tied into the first.",Hostel - Part II
275,jford-19,Oh dear!,1,21 August 2007,"I don't write reviews very often but i had to say something about this film - IT IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN! The 1st Hostel was pathetic - to do a sequel that follows exactly the same plot as the original shows how poor a film-maker Eli Roth really is. The only difference between this and the first one is... wait for it... it has girls instead of boys as the lead characters! I suppose that was to up the horror factor, like seeing girls tortured is more horrifying than seeing boys tortured. Wrong, wrong, wrong. As with the first, the characters so stupid and clichéd you couldn't care less about them. There's the geeky girl who's dialogue is so poor you really just want her to die quickly, the annoying party girl and of course the 'heroine' who is not all she seems.The 2 guys who are in on the kill are terrible, they act like 15 year olds smoking pot for the first time and were just hilarious. Their lines were weak - the F word 4 times in every sentence, one convincing the other that they 'had to do this, dude' etc. As if 40 year old businessmen calling each other 'dude' isn't bad enough, the predictability of their role reversals at the moment of truth is a howler.Another thing that annoyed me, like the first, in the first 35 minutes absolutely NOTHING happens. Its just talking where the characters involved cross paths until finally one of them gets kidnapped, with not one bit of interesting character development.Thats enough I can't go on. I never want to think about or see this rubbish ever again. The only people it will appeal to is 14 year old boys and/or incredibly stupid people. The sad thing is I fast-forwarded through half of it and still understood it all as most of the talking parts (which is 98% of the film with 2% horror) is completely unnecessary. This film is boring, there's hardly any horror, the acting is poor and the plot just pathetic. Avoid this film.",Hostel - Part II

Despite being a separate film, I find it to be very anticlimactic.I would not call this film much of a sequel, as its structure is recycled in the same fashion as the first, making it very predictable. It's almost as if Eli Roth re-wrote the first Hostel, and changed the main characters from male to female.And don't be fooled by the ads that claim this movie has an ""amazing ending that has never been seen on film before"", I was not so impressed, although it was much more entertaining than the first hour of the film.A good aspect of this film is that it focuses more on the people who pay to torture these tourists, showing you how their organization operates. The characters you are supposed to hate and find evil had the most depth, and were the most intriguing. The victims of the film were the usual horror film girls: 1 strong willed and logical, 1 slutty bimbo, and 1 outcast that the bimbo doesn't like.Unlike most sequels, Hostel: Part 2 does not do much to top the original. I personally felt that it did less. The first Hostel was gruesome, frightening, and very gory. This film fails to raise the bar set by the original, and just gives you more of the same with reduced entertainment value.Don't make it a trilogy, Eli.",Hostel - Part II
277,doctorgonzo71,Better than a poke in the franchise,5,1 July 2007,"It's obvious from the subject matter that some people will tell you this is brilliantly-paced horror, while others will recommend it be cast into the pit of doom and never watched. Fact is, if you liked the first Hostel film you are likely to have an urge to watch this follow-up, which no amount of bad reviews is going to dissuade you from doing.In terms of pure and simple entertainment value I wouldn't really fault Hostel 2 that much. It does what it's meant to. It's fairly well-constructed, the script runs without major disaster, and while you'll know most of what's coming a mile off there are a few character twists that leave you feeling not totally short-changed. The gore is well-controlled and pays homage to a million predecessors like any good ride with Tarrantino's endorsement should. Sound track and atmosphere are OK as well.But if you're hoping this instalment is going to actually add anything to the first film then I'd lower your expectations. Hostel 1 provided an obvious franchise and this is prudently cashing in on a ready-made audience. There is no deeper revelation, just a different set of commodities and clients. Business is business. The mystery and subsequent dawning truth of the first film provided most of its substance. I'm not sure where you'll find substance in the second outing.But if you hear someone saying something clichéd like, ""I'll never get those two hours back,"" it's worth considering they probably wasted 2 hours previously with Hostel 1 - and probably waste a lot of their time in fact. Again, if you liked the first film, or you're interested in brushing up on rudimentary horror film technique, or you just want to get your week's quota of entertaining gore (don't we all?)... then forget the reviews and see what you think. Of course, if you haven't seen the first film and none of the other criteria apply, then get the first train out of Slovakia my friend...",Hostel - Part II

But HOSTEL is by far superior in every way to the lacklustre sequel that dares to call itself HORROR.

""Hope springs eternal......?Anyway swapping girls for boys and leaving one survivor has been done before and is far from original. Its been done better in other movies. And KNB EFX seemed to loose it big time with very poor Gags. But making movies is far from easy, and i have no idea how complicated doing a movie is, let alone making a sequel. So i'll shut up now and go see if i can find a movie that will leave me replete with satisfaction!!Hostel : Very Good Hostel 2 : Very BadWHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD HORROR MOVIES GONE AAARRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!",Hostel - Part II
279,GlenderDude,"I should have been prepared, but...",1,12 March 2008,"It's hard to express my pure hatred for one Eli Roth. After being subjected to the god-awful and bewilderingly well-received Cabin fever, I was pleasantly surprised with Hostel. Okay, I'm not into the sick violence and torture porn, but I found the twist quite intelligent for a man of Roth's standing. It wasn't the best film by any stretch of the imagination, but it was quite clever. It is for this reason that I had high(ish) hopes for Part II. Alas, I was foolish for expecting more than depressing scenes of extreme violence, wafer-thin plotting and an all-round air of detest-ability. I was very nearly sick, but not because of the violence: simply for the reason that the censors allowed this shameless, vulgar and abominable piece of mind-numbing badness to pass through. You can see how some people can become messed up by watching this s--t. I know, I know, complaining about violence in a Hostel movie is like complaining of the dampness of water, but it was completely and unnecessarily graphic. Roth, I get your point, and you could have been so much cleverer and more effective if you weren't so violent. That f---ing scene with the scythe... S--t... You are a sick f---ing b-----d. You should be ashamed of yourself. Less is more, man... Less is more...",Hostel - Part II
280,ukon92,Let down,4,23 December 2007,"When I had heard that H2 had more blood and gore than H1, I thought that that would be cool, as long as it still retained its eerie, realistically plausible plot. H1 left me feeling creepy and wanting to camp out about as far away from an international airport as possible. It didn't need all the blood and gore because its plot brilliantly convinced me that a place like this could exist. Creepy... very creepy, but good creepy. Quintin had done an excellent job of giving me the ""heebie jeebies."" But H2, instead of building on plausibility, strays from it. I'm left shaking my head at what occurs, thinking, ""Yeah right"" for much of the film. And the added blood gore I had heard about, wasn't really more than in the first film. The plot twists just don't make a whole lot of sense, and the ending is abrupt and weak. If you can watch it for free fine, otherwise skip it.",Hostel - Part II
281,tobuildahome,Absolutely Awful Film,1,25 June 2007,"I just watched the film. About 1 hour and 40 minutes of utter garbage. I cannot express how awful it was, maybe some bits were gory, but the overall film in general is appalling. Simple tricks to get the characters out of situations, such as guns, which I despise in films. No twist and a boring story line. I think these films are best left to the producers and directors of the Saw films. De-humanization of beautiful woman must of been a main object in the director's mind, which was also overused. I did not enjoy the directing or acting. Such things as others have stated, as the shock tactics, were the main man behind the system has the gun to the children and ends up killing one child, which I believe did not work because you could envisage what the director/ writer had in mind. The end scene does not make any sense to the rest of the film, which seemed like a quick, simple way to end it, due to the lack of story. One last thing the gore is boring as well. However if you enjoy pointless, mind numbing, poor quality films I recommend this film to you. All in all a waste of time and money.",Hostel - Part II
282,eulogist,"Alas, Eli, this has already been done. Give us something new.",3,28 June 2007,"I gave it a lower rating than it perhaps normally would have due to the expectations surrounding this film.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS First, I really liked Hostel 1. *Really* liked it. I liked it because it was disturbing and difficult to watch and genuinely created a visceral reaction in me, which most movies cannot or will not do. 99.999% of horror movies especially are complete crap. Unbelievable, unrealistic, over the top, unemotional, great big yawn-fests. Hostel was different. See, most horror films boil down to ""insane killer with a thirst for blood goes on rampage"" blah blah blah. What made Hostel so disturbing was that moment when you found out WHY it was all happening. So then the insane killer wasn't some unbelievable cartoon character, it was the ""darkness in all of us"". Great twist, and I dug it. And you got this feeling that the victims were truly doomed, pleading begging for mercy only further guaranteed a painful death. Scary. Twisted. And very clever, in that it exploits such a deep fear in all of us, the fear of what can happen when you move out of your comfort zone. And best of all was the ending, that ending, when the creepy cold Dutch businessman who so brutally tortured and killed the genuinely likable Jay gets his come-uppance (sweet, sweet come-uppance) - oh - that was SO satisfying (again, visceral, emotional, you *react* to it).And when I heard that Roth was going to continue the story from the end of the first movie I was excited - where will he take the story from here? It's a beautiful set up to begin a story, underground torture ring, lone survivor, how will it all play out? It had great potential to develop some really new and interesting ideas. In the hands of a great writer, the stories that could come out of such a set-up would be awesome.So when the anti-hero Paxton got his head cut off within 5 minutes, I knew things were going to go downhill. And I was right.What the hell was this? BOOOORRRIINNNGGG. What is Roth on about - he wants people ""throwing up in the cinema"". From what? Okay, the Elizabeth Bathroy scene was cool and I thought that from there things were going to get really insane like the first movie: from Josh's death scene the film changes gears and things go absolutely crazy. But instead from that transitional scene, Hostel 2 stalled - badly. For one thing, the violence in this is super, super, super watered down and critics who say different should really get out more. People go on about the ""but it's women getting killed this time!!! :O"".A couple of questions about that: First, why is it that men being tortured and killed is cool, but if it happens to women it is depraved? It's equally horrific regardless of the gender of the victim, folks, and if your sympathy goes only as far as the existence of a vagina then I say it is YOU who are sick. Secondly, you'll notice that not *once* in this movie do you see a man kill a woman. You see women kill men, men kill men, women kill women. But never a man kill a woman. And right there is the big giveaway that Roth wimped out - big time - with this film. Because think about it - in a world so terribly misogynistic as ours (and it really is, kids, open your eyes) it is completely believable that there are sick depraved men that would love nothing more than to rape, torture and kill women (and - duh - this happens the world over with appalling regularity). If Roth really wanted to get into the whole ""exploring the dark side of human nature"" this is probably the darkest aspect of human nature that exists, and one of the most prolific. Scary stuff. Absolutely terrifying stuff. But he just couldn't do it, he couldn't bring himself to really get into it. He would like to think of himself as this big badass director who ""pushes the envelope"" but as Paul Keating would say, it's all just palaver, he's nowhere near as bold or resolute as he thinks. And Hostel 2 is the proof. It comes across as a movie directed by a man whose heart just isn't in it. If he or his audience think this stuff is horrific it just shows how limited his and our imagination have truly become. Half an hour of any war anywhere in the world at any point in history is a thousand times worse than anything Roth could dredge up out of his murky little imagination.But he clearly enjoyed making the first film and wanted another run at it, so that's what he made. This isn't Hostel 2. This is ""Hostel - the remake (by Eli Roth)"". Rather than continue a story after setting it up brilliantly, he just banged out the same script with the same premise and the same characters again. Don't believe me? Alrighty then, picture this if you will: Eli Roth is going to make Hostel 3. He goes into the production studio's office and says ""Okay, here's the premise for Hostel 3. You got these three American backpackers travelling through Europe and they meet this stranger who tells them there's this place in Slovakia. What they DON'T know is that it's really a front for an underground torture ring called Elite Hunting!!! DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING DID YA!?! BOOYAAHH!!"".Alas, Eli, this has already been done.

283,evantwales,"Jeesh, this movie was soo bad I don't even know where to start!!",1,3 July 2007,"Sadly the voting scroll didn't provide a zero!! I would first like to start off by saying, ""Who in their right minds would give Eli Roth money to make this crap??"" I cringe just thinking about all the money that was wasted away from people stupid enough to purchase tickets to see this horrible movie. Luckily for me I didn't pay to see this, instead had a fellow pal pay for me....phew!! Anyways, sitting in this movie was very different from sitting in any other movie, in that the audience was more prone to laugh than to scream or even jump a little. I knew I was being an idiot when I decided to see this, but I never realized why I had been an idiot that day, until when the credits started rolling. I than realized that the biggest reason why I was such an idiot was because I watched that pathetic excuse of a movie!!!! I quickly sprinted out of the theater, hopped into my car and sped straight away to my house where many respectable horror titles remain. After talking with my friends I actually started to get jealous of the people back in the seventies and even the early eighties. Why may you ask?? Because of the fact that they had the opportunity to go to a theater and view flicks that were so much better than Eli's films. They got to go into a crowded theater and see Michael Myers attack Annie from her cars backseat and jump because it was so scary!! Those must have been the days!! Nowadays I am surrounded by picky, stupid young adults who don't want to see scary stuff...nah....they would much rather spend up to ten bucks to sit and watch naked pathetic girls get tortured and view old ugly ladies bathing in blood.....what the heck!! Eli must have some sick sick fantasies he had to conjure into his films..instead we should take the wacko throw him into an institution and leave filmmakers such as John Carpneter and even Rob Zombie to make more of their movies because at least their films are somewhat enjoyable to watch!!",Hostel - Part II
284,j_coache,"A big big let down, could do so much better!",4,9 September 2007,"Have to say these movies have been on a downward spiral since the opening 10 minutes of the original Hostel. While the 1st at least contained a little bit of excitement and a few gory and hard to watch moments the follow up doesn't even offer that and becomes painfully predictable as well as being poorly directed and acted for that matter.I was kind of hoping that this release would provide a different and more interesting angle than the 1st and in some respects it does. There is more focus on how the Hostel operates and does business but unfortunately this ultimately becomes the only focus and the director must seriously have run out of ideas early on. The death and torture scenes are not even a scratch on the 1st Hostel, the unwatchable nerve tingling sight of seeing someone's achilles tendons snap was one of the better moments in the original but there is nothing even as bad in this version, in fact they are little more than brutal, I've seen Conan and Robocop perform more entertaining executions (not that I'm a gore freak, but these movies supposedly strive for shock and gross out moments) I was at least hoping to see something different in this movie, but the only real noticeable differences are that instead of guys its girls who are the victims and that this sequel is severely lamer than the original. The biggest frustration is that there is so much room for improvement with these films, had Tarantino directed them himself you could guarantee an entertaining watch but for all the intriguing build up and plot these films really fail to deliver anything but a few gory moments that make your stomach turn, don't hold your breath for anything revolutionary in Hostel 3!",Hostel - Part II
285,Reecyy,Waste Of Time....,1,26 February 2008,"Hostel part 2 is a bad film to the first.The story is ridiculous at the end it just finishes.Its really like the first one:3 Girls (2nd), 3 Boys (First) ,and they use the same hotel as ''Hostel'',the storyline of both films is stupid.And there gore of it its Appalling its really stupid,but the only good thing about this film is that it has good horror in it.I would not recommend this film to anyone,i would if you like this salt of thing.The acting is horrendous.Most of the people on this film can't acted a horror film its just a stupid movie,waste of time and waste of money..",Hostel - Part II
286,tenacious_d07,"Similar to its predecessor, but more entertaining.",6,24 September 2015,"Very entertaining. Sick and insane, it appeals to the people who can watch people scream and endure perverse torture as though they were watching the original A Nightmare on Elm Street. Like the first movie, a large portion of Hostel Part II is devoted to character development and lead-up. But, as a sequel should, it also brings some new ideas forth. The most obvious change, aside from the three main characters (victims), who are now women-- if that makes a difference--there are two other characters who take the spotlight (one in particular). These characters are the men who have paid to kill the three girls. So we see this movie from the perspectives of the victims and the culprits, which is an interesting feature. We also see some different ways people who have 'bought' a victim choose to carry out their fantasies. They really can do ANYTHING they want with their victim. Pretty nasty stuff. I was able to enjoy this more after having viewed Part I, since I was better prepared for a campier experience. I'm not particularly squeamish, and nothing in this movie really grossed me out more than my nerves anticipated it would. Not to mislead you, though: this is still a very bloody film with a twisted concept. Gorier than the original (in fact, almost all of the violent scenes in the original are shown again to catch everyone up in the intro), though perhaps a bit less serious. Not a bad experience, though it's quite a silly film. Once more, plenty of entertainment value if you're into it.",Hostel - Part II

Brutally hilarious and quirky, I think anyone with a dark sense of humor will get a kick out of this movie. There is plenty of gore and a few decent twists that will keep you guessing as to who is really going to survive, but in the end, it cycles back to the morbid humor that makes Mr. Roth a modern genius. I think it's comparable to ""Thanksgiving"" from Grindhouse. Fans of Eli will definitely take to this one like a blowtorch!",Hostel - Part II
288,stbsolo,Very disappointing,3,10 June 2007,"I remember watching Hostel and thinking to myself that I would never go to a hotel in Europe, ever. It was one of those irrational thoughts you get after seeing a movie that disturbs you much like the feeling of heading down a river in West Virginia, just don't do it.I waited patiently for this film to hit the theaters. I should have waited longer, maybe for it to be on one of the On Demand channels.The fact is that this movie doesn't give those who loved the first Hostel what they would want out of a second. Without giving too much away, the movie is just disappointing and when it ends it does so quickly and you're actually saying, ""are you serious?"" Bottom line, if you want to watch a good movie about a killing factory in Europe, watch the first Hostel, if you want to waste your money in the theater, watch the second.",Hostel - Part II
289,thirdimpact1,Neutered,5,1 June 2007,"*Some spoilers* I don't know what happened to Eli Roth, be it corporate influence or just a softening of sensibilities but this move is TAME. Unlike the first one, this one doesn't have nearly the visceral impact nor the necessary sadistic streak to allow this type of film to appropriately succeed to its core audience. Call me crude, but I wanted buckets of blood and gore. What I got was a mild drizzle.The storyline itself is pretty much identical, only replace Paxton, his friend and Oli with three American girls. The beginning of the movie does a good job tying up the first film, showing Paxton's fate, but all it did was eliminate the most interesting character right off the bat and only leaving the crap left. The fact that it looks into the business side of the Hostel torture industry only elminates all sense of mystery that could have helped build up the suspense.For a story focused on torture and murder, its a SLOW burn. It wasn't until maybe 60 minutes into the movie that the first girl is offed (in an admittedly cool Elizabeth Bathory inspired sequence). Seeing that the movie is barely 90 minutes long, that doesn't leave a lot of time for things to be resolved and for people to be killed. There were maybe one or two ""WTF"" moments before the credits (one including cannibalism and another with a kid being killed) but none of them were as strong as what happened in the first Hostel.I think the last act deserves mentioning because that was where everything happened. I'll leave spoilers out but suffice it to say there was nothing even CLOSE to the badassness of Paxton's escape. It all kind of just dwindles down and a deus ex machina so blatant it almost hurts rears its head. I know it was eluded to earlier in the film but how it was implemented was pretty ridiculous.All in all, the first Hostel still rates as one of my favourite horror movies. This one? It feels like the Saw sequels - quickly put together with all the passion for the project seemingly gone.",Hostel - Part II

Like, at the beginning, woman walks on her bf beheaded and her reaction is like ""oh!"". They did try to make the Beth the smart one, but even tho she did say couple of smart things (mainly warn her friend about shady guys that approach them), she herself took quite a long time to figure Axelle out while there were obvious hints (No one is that aggressively nice naturally while just leaving you alone in the pool and then appearing our of thin air when you get chased to ""save you""). It's pretty predictable most of the way (one of my main pet peeves here is the classic: cool main character that is obviously going to win because his/her friends are dumb, shallow or just weird). And lets be real, you can play it that she survived cause she is smart and ""badass"" but the only real reason she lives is cause she's rich. Bonus points for that Bathory reference but that indeed appears to be the peak scene of this movie imo.

Hostel 2 not only a better ending than the typical horror (is it really over) ending of part 1 but it also has a more consistent story line, better acting, descent lead character development and interesting plot twist. I would highly recommend this film to any fans of the handful of truly good horror/thriller movies out there such as (Saw1 and the Ring).

292,twoshedsmcginty,A waste of genuine talent,5,8 June 2007,"Eli Roth's sequel to his alarming but highly effective 2006 torture-porno presents us once again with a depressing vision of humanity.A new set of -this time female- American kids are lured to the industrial confines of Roth's torture-house to be savagely murdered by high-powered businessmen who have bid, eBay-like, for the privilege of indulging their most bloodthirsty fantasies on young innocents. Once again we are asked to assume that the human capacity to enjoy other people's suffering runs in a prosaic arc with Big Brother at one end and vicious acts of torture and murder at the other, and that only money and local laws stand in the way of complete indulgence.This was a tenuous-enough premise in the original film, where the bloodthirsty rich were shadowy and mysterious figures, and Roth takes an interesting risk in Part II by taking us under the skin of two of the 'Hostel's' well-heeled clients, an American executive who believes that committing murder will give him a killer-edge in business, and the more timorous associate he drags along with him.The narrative arc of these 'clients' gives Part II at least some differentiation from the original film.Really Part II is actually Hostel 2.0.1. As per the original, it passes the first half of the movie introducing us to well-drawn and credible characters, building up empathy which it then proceeds to hack at with a chainsaw...The second half of the film begins with the first 'commercial murder', a scene so ugly, depressing and vilely pornographic that it could be an excerpt from some otherwise utterly unfilmable, ultra-extreme S&M lesbian bondage porno.The gentlest and least-offensive of the unfortunate American girls is hung by her feet over a large bath where an attractive -older- naked woman with an Elizabeth Bathory fixation luxuriates in the blood that she draws from her victim with tentative stabs and scratches from a scythe. She savours the early rivulets of blood that spatter her face, but soon is unable to hold back any longer, and goes for the 'money shot' - slashing the terrified and tearful girl's throat open, apparently climaxing as she is showered in the blood and gore of her victim.Be offended. Be very offended. The intention of the scene is to make you actively participate in the 'enjoyment', and to pay for the privilege, like Bathory-woman. Unlike the many other hard-to-watch scenes in both Hostel films, this one fails the John Carpenter criteria for justifying torture-porn, which assumes that we are emphasising with the victim and not the torturer; here the grisly tableaux is laid out in the classic camera angles, stark colours and erotic half-lighting of glossy pornography, and to a sickening and degrading effect for the viewer.Contrary to much rumour, there is no overt sexual violence in the film, except inasmuch as the female sex are far more traditional fodder for this particular brand of cinematic exploitation than the all-male back-packers of Hostel, and their suffering in the torture-farm inevitably brings charges of misogyny, angering a tender sentiment which the first film could not, since men are seen to be 'at home' in the context of violence and horror.Yes, there is a horrifying finale to rival the 'eye' sequence in Hostel, but it is aimed at men, almost solely intended to defuse the film's misogynistic ambiance and lacks the cross-gender horror of its progenitor. The ending itself is also far less convincing than that of the original, and there is no equivalent of the Tarantino-esquire moment in Hostel where Jay Hernandez realises that he cannot leave one of his fellow victims to his fate, and returns to the House Of Horrors (in any case a plastic copy of Bruce Willis's moment of conscience in Pulp Fiction).Eli Roth is an eminently capable story-teller in the vein of Hitchcock himself, but risks burying himself in the rut of shock/schlock-horror - if he keeps on the path that Part II indicates he is on, he will not even make an adequate Brian De Palma clone.",Hostel - Part II

294,jsnwallach,Hostel part 2 quite simply... sucked!,1,9 June 2007,"Look, the first film came out of nowhere and I found it to be a pretty damn disturbing film. The sequel is not a disturbing film, nor is it frightening, terrifying, suspenseful or scary in any way, shape, or form. The music does little to help the film and the acting is 5th rate pretty much across the board. The gore is almost non existent and really the film is total rehash of the first film taking away all of the best parts by revealing entirely too much about the organization. Less certainly is more.In this film you aren't even afforded the opportunity to watch these three overacting and incredibly annoying female characters get a slow and agonizing death. And don't call me sick, you know what this film's supposed to be about. Eli Roth proves, in spades, that the torture genre is on its way out as soon as it stepped in the door. It's a very limited genre which was tackled much more appropriately in the first film.There's no creepy atmosphere in this film, the snippets of torture that you are afforded in this trifle of a film are so predictable and stupid that you'd wish you were at home watching Troll 2 or biting your toenails... you know, something productive to do with your time.It seems to me that Eli Roth is just a bit full of himself after the success of Hostel, so much so that this watered down sissified excuse for a horror film is actually attracting recycled reviews from its predecessor... ""The scariest horror film in years."" If you think that then you should automatically cease being a movie critic. This film wouldn't even scare little kids.I'm going to have to lump this turd in with all of the shitty horror remakes that have been strained out by the Hollywood cookie cutter machine in the last few years beginning with that Blair Witch Chainsaw Massacre pile of crap back in '03.I'm starting to think Eli Roth would make a great comedic director.This film is pointless, useless, and worthless.",Hostel - Part II
295,redandblue32,Awful,3,9 June 2007,This movie was much weaker than its predecessor. The worst part about it was the plot. Towards the end I found myself utterly disbelieving the characters' actions and motives. As for the end - did we really hate that one character so much to see her head get kicked around like a soccer ball? Did that satisfy anyone? Didn't the evil head honcho behind the whole operation deserve it more (the older guy who shot the child)? The way they neatly pruned off Paxton in the first five minutes was transparent. I would've been fine without seeing him at all in the film. The torture scenes are much more scarce. Skip the movie and see the first one.,Hostel - Part II

Yet again! I would be hard pushed to argue this movie is anything but an excuse to once again try and push the boundaries of explicit violence and depravity, something that seems to be a bit of a trend these days. The narrative is fairly primitive, and in many aspects it is a replica of the first. American backpackers lured to a hostel in Slovakia where they are kidnapped and sold to the highest bidder to be tortured and killed. Only its girls this time.However this movie does take the viewer a little further behind the scenes of the 'business', and follows two rich 'clients' through the process of purchasing a subject right through to the torture chamber sequences. Something that was quite interesting if you enjoyed the first film.The first film I found fairly believable, and could actually imagine such a place in some remote part of Europe - which is party what added to my enjoyment of it. This installment not quite as well thought out and I did find the twist at the end totally impossible to accept.

Way much more storytelling and character building.Of course the story could be much better but we have to remember this is ""part 2"" and out of that reason they made it much better than expected.This time you got women instead men.One of them is not only good looking but smarter than the others & smarter than the torture elite.
A rich daughter but not a sissy princess. Other like her best friend which is a tipically party girl and the other girl a nerdy student experience her first time outside the bubble ""nerdy"" world.And exactly that is the weakness of the two friends. One wants to have fun with alcohol, drugs and boys - she will get catched. The other is blinded by her normally ""nerdy"" world and experience the live outside of the bubbles. She too gets catched because of a boy she met at the village party.
It seems like a big romance and the journey of here live. Instead it will be the end of her life.Meanwhile they also show the other side. One men won an audition to torture the main character long before they are really catched and ready for torture.The part with the audition also was a great scene and shows the various kind of killers in their normal familiy / business life. A message pops up (mobile phone or computer) and they all are invitied to the audition.The winner for the torture of the main character informs a friend and both will for the first time get ready to torture.While the friend seems like a normal family guy - the other seems like a ""macho"" type of family men who just want to kill someone. The introduction to both of them is good.And the normal family guy will be the more sadistic. The ""tough"" one can talk the talk but not walk the walk. Also a great twist at the end for the 2 villian characters.The torture scenes are not too much and not to less except you want to enjoy no storyand senseless torture.If this is the case you better not watch this movie.But if you like this kind of genre as all around skeletal structure with a strong & intelligence main character, a quite good story and an very good ending for a movie like this you will enjoy watching it.It is not a waste of time and those ~ 90 minutes are perfect to watch while at home and just want to ""relax"" and watch a movie while doing this.",Hostel - Part II
300,Rebuh_The_Blackfish,great film all up!,8,7 June 2007,"For the past year i have been holding my hopes extremely high for a good cinematic experience. and not actually thinking i did at first after i walked out of the cinema, i let it sink in. and i ended up loving HOSTEL: PART 2 equally, not if more, then the first HOSTEL.Eli Roths use of demented humor (especially at the last scene) left me laughing (and the other cinema goers too).I felt that Eli tied up all the loose ends and it made quite the tight package.His use of tie-ins from the first HOSTEL were cute. Especially about the war in Bosnia, and not in Slovakia.Though i felt the gore was lacking in some parts (especially in the ending of Whitneys life by the hands of Stuart (Roger Bart). But then i realized something. Eli didn't amp up the gore like i was hoping, he kept it about the same as the first HOSTEL. and in that, i respect Eli for holding back and not doing what the creators and director did in the Saw Franchise.i have to mention one scene with the characters Todd and Stuart (Richard Burgi and Roger Bart), when they are prepping themselves, ordering their choice of weapons, getting into the Elite Hunting outfits, that sequence alone makes HOSTEL: PART 2 so much more beautiful. a big hand to the folks who scored the film! and this brings me to the Story. In my honest opinion, i believe that the story was much more developed then the first HOSTEL. Eli did more character development then he did in HOSTEL. i wont ruin it here, but i was generally amazed at some of the twists, especially regarding Todd and Stuart (Richard Burgi and Roger Bart).all in all, a fantastic film when i thought about it, with its use of demented humor and sadistic appeal. not a film to be missed. i will be definitely looking out for Eli Roths other projects.",Hostel - Part II
301,shadowstriker86,"same lame garbage, different gender",1,4 June 2007,"OK....first hostel was just 2 guys getting tortured the hell out of for 2 hours while they try to escape. albeit graphic and gory, not much else to it and not worth 8$. now they make a 2nd one about 3 chicks instead of 2 guys. there's some rumor i heard that the story shows more of the villains motivation to do what they do, but unless it's to create a giant 20 ft. tall panda to try and take over the world, i see no originality in the motivation. the problem with Hollywood is that they only try to make flash, not substance, and when you have nothing but flash, it leads to stale movies with bad stories (Pirates 3 for example). And that includes sequel after sequel after sequel. And believe it or not there are some movies coming out with the same damn storyline as movies from years past, just a few itsy bitsy things have been changed, if you don't believe me, look at the story for ""knocked up"". I won't tell you what movie it copied, but if you're smart enough, you'll figure it out. If not well.....then too bad so sad.",Hostel - Part II
302,pallet-ed_v_pimp_91,"Oh No, What Have They Done",4,2 August 2007,"Were do i begin with Hostel Part 2, first of all it ain't as good as the first one. Not by much though but it is definitely not as good. One of these reasons are because there isn't much action or horror it's more about the hostel than anything. Were as the first one shocked those who watched it due to it's gore this one doesn't because we have already seen it, despite a very different death at the end that i don't recall seeing in any film before but that needs to be seen yourself. Although the film lacks in torture scenes it is based more about how the hostel functions which is how the film gains a bit of credit it helps you understand the film a bit more. Also one good thing about again is the women involved in the film they are very nice to look at. The main things is it ain't better than its predecessor and it less gory but still worth watching if you like a horror films, more of a rental than a purchase.",Hostel - Part II
303,dr_philip_decker,Hostel 2 is a joke and is ruining the genre. Truly disappointed.,1,7 June 2007,"Hostel was an obscure film that delved into the world that Andrew Kevin Walker's original script, 8mm, (not the butchered film that Schumacher directed) had created. Eli ripped off some of the most beautiful subtext from that film and produced a mindnumbing film that had me squirming with delight.It was inevitable that there would be a second visit to the Slovakian Hostel. This time around, Eli lets us down. There is absolutely no story development, characters overwrought with cliché, tainted gore that he borrows from Bousman and the Saw franchise and a laughable plot.The characters are vexing and we don't seem to care about any of them. Maybe it was a godsend that the film leaked because this should help the theatrical release. Audiences are very disappointed and will probably turn out to see what the supposed ""final cut"" of the film looks like. Eli will then again have the last laugh.Surf's Up, man. That's all I can say!",Hostel - Part II
304,zstatrdust111,Just plain Awful,1,1 June 2007,"OK, I was a fan of the first but now I'm starting to think I was a fan of my version of the first. All movies should have things that you think about when you leave the theatre. Hostel was one of them, by no means a perfect film but a very good effort. This however is so bad that it actually ruins the first. All the stuff you had in your head goes away, you see too much of the inner workings and it just doesn't make sense. The acting is awful with the exception of the lead girl (the one who lives). The character switch at the end makes absolutely no sense,The big guy knows they'll kill him if he doesn't finish her off and whats a bullet to the head when you've sawed her face off? The whole scene on the train is cringeworthy, the set ups look bad, the crowd of Italian soccer fans are all wearing fake jerseys for instance. And the end is crap, Don't get me wrong I squirmed in my seat when she had scissors wrapped around his nuts, decent horror moment and kind of funny. But one why the hell would you be calling her names - NO MAN WOULD!!! and two why did the evil group let her chop off the other girls head. The bubblegum kids don't work, it takes 40mins to actually see the torture place again. Jay Hernandez should have been in a more central role, although I did like his death scene. The bloodbath was good - the rest sucked - I've seen Last House on the Left and a woman bite off a wee willy, I don't really need to see it again. Although I think Eli Roth does again and again and again. The whole character switch thing is rubbish, one guy bottles it AFTER he puts a saw through a girls head and ther other goes a little mental when he looks at a picture of his wife, BS! I wanted to see them pick up all sorts of different weapons from the rack in the trailer like that bit in Kill Bill. I wanted more humour and more smarts. A man's penis getting chopped off and fed to a dog was funny, sick and made everyone squirm but as for a ""big payoff"" it was a waste of time. Eli Roth is in fact a crappy film maker who got lucky and kudos to the guy for jumping on QT train and riding it all the way, I would too. In terms of being the horror guy of this generation - Aja, Marshall, Wan and all the other splat pack dudes are waaaayy ahead - even those who've only had one film! Another point - The MPAA should seriously be ashamed of themselves, they're a joke. Whats the point of them if they don't say - ""No you can't show a man's penis being cut off and fed to a dog - just cut away"". This should be a NC-17, no way a Rated R. I'm not one for censoring films. Devils Rejects, SAW franchise etc all had good points in trying to push their films by the board but this is getting ridiculous, just scrap the MPAA. They don't do anything but get talked into stupid ideas.",Hostel - Part II
305,ShadowHades,Same Thing but with girls,7,7 June 2007,This movie i must say is the same exact thing as the first one tho different characters.There are 2 main characters in this film and one they picked up(just like Oli on the first one).And a girl lures them in going to Slovakia and the same hostel(just like Alex).Instead of girls tricking them and sleeping with them of course its men.Maybe u guess ... yes one does escape just like the first :P very predictable ... and for you guys watch out 'cause a guy gets his penis cut off with scissors.It also has a few characters from the first one like Paxton(The guy from the first one to escape)and also the same guy at the front desk.Overall its pretty good but the part where the girl is naked and hanging upside and the girl cutting her with the scythe i could have done without.,Hostel - Part II
306,drgnguy44,Terrible beyond words,1,8 June 2007,"I don't understand how a good movie like Hostel can have such a crappy sequel. Most people say the end of a crappy movie is the best, but this one managed to prove that statement wrong as it ended in one of the most ridiculous ways. I seriously would like to have my 5 dollars back because I really feel that this film was a waste of my time. So they let someone out this time because she killed someone, but in the last one they did not want to go by that rule.Also, what was the deal with the sudden change of heart and whole point of view that Stuart had in the end? Very....very bad movie. Just watch the first one and pretend there isn't a sequel, you will thank me later.",Hostel - Part II
307,HoMeR_3,Hostel 2 is such a worse film!!!,1,17 June 2007,"I really enjoyed hostel part 1. It was something new for me. But hostel part 2 was intolerable!! The beginning was were shocking and it sets the mood perfect. The next 45 minutes were the most tiresome minutes in a movie ever!! In hostel 1 it was almost about the same but far more entertaining than the 45 minutes in hostel part 2!!! Then suddenly torture....but what kind of torture....very very boring! Nothing new, nothing special. No entertaining!! Tons of blood....(i thought a human has about 6 liters of blood...in hostel they have about 100)!! The film was almost finished and i looked at my watch ...and thought...damn ...15 minutes left...where is the action?!? If the producer thinks throwing genitals in front of a dog produces action...than i have nothing to add!! The end was very very boring! You could even see the end 20000 miles coming and it was no surprise! I was very disappointed because i waited for this movie almost half a year and was so happy to see it in the cinema but it was a WASTE OF TIME and a intolerable COST!!! I hope god is saving those 100 minutes for me!!!!! Don't watch this film if you want to think in you're future positive about HOSTEL!!",Hostel - Part II
308,timcory,"Eli Roth mixed it up, regrettably?",6,19 June 2007,"Hostel #1 was a work of art. It went where few have ventured before. It was freaky imagining myself in the travelers place. It's sequel didn't force me to squirm like the first one did. I'll agree that some of that is because I had somewhat of an idea on what the storyline or content was going to be, but I felt it was a little mixed up? Maybe Roth & Tarrantino clashed on some of their ideas while editing? I have no idea exactly, but I just felt like it was jumbled together a little and left very little to the imagination. Take my opinion for what it is, but I've seen almost every horror or hacker as I like to describe them, as well as every other suspense movie imaginable. Hostel 1 & 2 remind me of Speed 1 & 2. The 1st was exciting and new and the 2nd was an attempt for the same, but it just didn't get there. Hostel 2 is entertaining, but only vaguely close to the mastermind story of the 1st. Take it for what you will.",Hostel - Part II

Who would put any money in this film? after reading the script, that is if there is a script, because by the lack of quality it is easy to think they just made it up as they went along. I think the first one had some rare qualities, that made it stand out, and was all around pretty good, but with Hostel - Part 2 they hit the bottom....Reasons: Story dosen't sell......at allNot in any way as intense and scary as HostelNot the best actingMovie not believable for me anywayI was looking forward to see Hostel Part 2, so for me this was a BIG disappointment",Hostel - Part II
310,pubcat997-1,Disappointingly predictable,4,4 September 2007,"I had high hopes for this sequel. The first one was such a novel concept. I couldn't wait to see what they would come up with for the second one. Unfortunately it was almost a carbon copy of the first, just swapping girls for the guys. The high point of the movie was the scene when she paid castrated Stuart and paid her way out of the factory. I may have actually hooted at that. Other than that a complete waste of film and time. I generally like sequels if they have some new angles or ideas. This one doesn't. Just more ways for people to die. At least they could have made it some place in a civilized nation, that would have made it a little scary. What is it with producers thinking that bloody naked people = horror. What?

What was eli Roth thinking,by the way?sensationalism?Shock values?Box office rope-tricks?If he thought he would get away by merely making the audience puke,he was wrong....wrong....wrong.What is the point of this movie?throat slashing?Full frontal female nudity?tearing out male genitals?Where is the POINT?there is even not an attempt to tell a story(its predecessor had that at least),and all we get is a mindless,soulless bloodbath.Jay Hernandez,the only saving grace of the first movie,is done away with in the first 10 minutes,and what follows is an assortment of trash performances made worse by a non-existent storyline.Nothing is there.We miss the menace of ""Silence of the Lambs"",the surrealism of ""The Cell"",the style of ""Reservoir Dogs""even the disturbing vision of ""Ichi the Killer"".All shabby rooms,spiked chairs and terrible screams---how long are gonna take it?whatever the answer,trust me,its longer than that.

312,Newrenterfilms,another bad film by eli roth,1,4 November 2007,"I'm not surprised, and apparently the general public is catching on to the fact that eli roth is a hack, and that hostel 2 was horrible. Eli Roth in his endless journey to promote himself will not even admit it's failure saying hostel 2 cost 10 million to make, so when it opens to 12 million the film is a success.... well he doesn't go into marketing costs etc. and totally sidesteps the issue that hostel 2 was a failure. The idea behind the hostel films are good. the execution, acting, pretty much everything above and below the line is bad. I guess the gore is well done, but I credit the effects teams for that. I think hostel should be made by a talented filmmaker and really made into not only a suspenseful film, but a thought provoking one on the human condition. I'm not sure why Tarantino is dragging his name through the mud by having his name help market the films. I find it humorous in the last posting comparing eli roth to ewe boll. at least ewe boll tries different genres (granted he fails at all of them) but eli roth can't even handle one genre well, and his ego knows no bounds i.e. his name above the film. I bet you, you're bottom doller, his name doesn't appear over the title of the next film he does.",Hostel - Part II
313,lickle_vicky,Watchable... But A Desperate Attempt For Shock Factor,3,4 January 2008,"The film is to be honest more like a gore-filled show for those sick people out there who enjoy such activities. The storyline contains many holes that are poorly filled with gory sequences involving the sadistic torture of females.I am nowhere near a feminist but the film hits on many sexist notes, for example, Whitney is dressed in lingerie for her torture & murder sequence and repeatedly called obscenities that are only really meant for women.If I'm honest... Hostel was watchable verging on enjoyable, Hostel Part II was sick & a pathetic attempt verging on watchable.A serious let-down.",Hostel - Part II
314,thefilmfiend,Hostel Hilarity,6,24 June 2007,"Hostel I was fundamentally an exploitive exercise in sex then in violence. Nevertheless, a deeper meaning exists beyond the sexual exploits and gore. Even if one is unimpressed with its anti-hero subtext, the violent effects surpass all previous horror films in its technical achievements. The few CGI effects present in the film are use sparingly and often without much flare or attention; only two shots incorporate CGI, which last about only a second in totality. The movie attempts to fool the viewer with minimalists standards in the first half only to unveil its true production worth in its finale. With a realistic premise the second film logically explores the nature and motivations of the clients of the torture club.Unlike the first Hostel the second film chronicles both the journeys of its victims and the perpetrators with both plots cumbersomely interwoven with each other. Instead of young male teenagers, Roth focuses on three attractive women to serve as the film's visual feast. The women soon become lured by Axelle (Vera Jordanova) to forgo plans in Prague for a less raucous time at a therapeutic spa in Brataslava. Her promises of solace are juxtapose with rambunctious train ride, in which raving, sexually charged Euro-trash verbally, and nearly physically assault the three timid Americans. At this point Roth seems to be humorously stereotyping Europeans with equal glee as he did in first installment with Americans. Not surprisingly, the Americans choose the spa. Interestingly, this movie's three college-aged travelers are not nearly as despicable as the last. While only single faceted, Roth does not permit his characters to lapse into ignominious action or judgment that would typically (by horror genre rules) eternally doom them to an painful, instantaneous death. In short, these new characters can be tolerated but not appreciated.While half of the movie is devoted to young, perky co-eds, the other half addresses the role of their soon-to-be murderers. Whereas the first film cloaks this torturous operation in conspiracy, the second openly and light-heartedly chronicles the journey of two middle-age American business men. Sadly, the murder for hire narrative unmasks nothing not understood from the first film. Even the Russian mafia connections suggested in the first film are not discussed. The viewer is reacquainted with familiar characters, and moreover the eerie settings of the first movie. The familiarity ruins the ominous, haunting appeal successfully created by the first film. Interestingly, the two characters in Hostel Part II are essentially the equivalent of Labute's Chad (Arron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) in In the Company of Men. In fact these characters progress through the same developments and changes as Labute's. Disappointingly, Roth's character's are not nearly as well developed as LaBute's. The weak development of the characters is further accentuated in the conclusion. Ultimately, the alternating plot lines between perpetrator and victim only limit the character growth. However, the two clients in the tradition of the morticians Rosencrantz and Guildenstern add a climate of dark humor to the film not present in the first film. Perhaps their undeveloped characters are too blame for the dark humor, yet it seems more purposeful than unintentional. Regardless, this humor does not succeed in propelling the climax into any new heights of dramatic standing; rather, it only appears weak in character motivation and certitude. The lack of developed plot lines hinders this fantastical resolve. As if Roth understood the inherent weaknesses of his film, he attached an equally absurd final two minutes in conclusion to further the film's transition into a giddy comedy. The film transforms into a dark comical fantasy rather than an equally compelling horror flick. Even the technical aspects of gore do not out weight its predecessor. Nevertheless, the film still maintains an edge that few horror movies possess- creativity.While closely and adamantly fastened itself to genre-lines, the first installment hinted at moral ambiguity and a Herzogian human condition during the film's conclusion. This brief discussion of the human condition propels Roth beyond the realm of the horror genre into a more metaphysical exegesis of film-making. The second film only haphazardly explores these dilemmas of empowerment. Moreover, the lack of screen time for his murder-loving protagonists frustrates this analytical approach to murder. Despite its flaws the film is still enjoyable and promise still exists in the talented hands of Eli Roth.",Hostel - Part II
315,alex_united2,Not a patch on the first film...,5,9 July 2008,"Having watched this last night, i must say i was very surprised by the lack of originality to this film. It is almost a carbon copy of the first, (which is one of my fave horror films), but minus the atmosphere and feeling of dread. Don't get me wrong, i thought German as the leading lady was good, and she had a bit of intelligence about her character that we don't always see in horror films, what with warning her mate not to go off on a boat trip, and looking after her more wild mate that just seems to want to get hammered and laid (in whatever order - fair play!), but it lacked the sense of doom the other film had. i think this was mostly because the 2 main killers were cheesy Americans who for me were too over-the top to be considered menacing (the tattoo scene made me cringe, 'i'm proud of mine'). I know this shows that anyone can turn into a killer if they have a dark desire and a bit of wedge in their back pocket, but for me it loses the mystery the first film had with a creepy European gang, and you already know what's round the corner so you find yourself asking 'why am i watching this'? in my honest opinion, for this sort of film, the less you know about the people behind all the sinister dealings the better.",Hostel - Part II
316,chrismoisey,Pointless,2,3 August 2008,"OK I get the aim of the film, it's a part of human nature to be intrigued by torture and murder. The more disgusted you are the more you will watch until the thus end exposing your own so called hypocrisy.However this film is terrible, it is merely a collection of gratuitous murder scenes with irrelevant and obsolete sub plots wrapped around them in an attempt to form some sort of plot. The killing of the first films central character was so rushed it came across as an annoyance that needed to be nipped in the bud. The three men on the train served no purpose other than to suggest European railways are full of potential rapists and the less said about the killing of the child the better.And then we have the character twists which were about as believable as the idea that the Moon is made of cheese. Now I know Tarantino has had some influence here, after all his last 3 films have all been about the empowerment of women but please a young woman who seconds before was going to be killed horrifically somehow manages to trick and kill her executioner and then negotiates her way out free to tell the world about the place she has just been. Honestly did Eli Roth not sit down one night and think ""I am making a real crock of s##t here""? Honesty this film is 90 minutes of your life that you will never get back. You could paint that wall in your house that you've been meaning to and then watch it dry. A far more rewarding experience!",Hostel - Part II
317,Deflun,Hollywood gone wrong.,1,22 September 2008,"OK, first of all, get into my shoes, I'm a nice guy y'know, I normally like or at most don't really mind ""bad"" movies, heck, I've found myself saying movies are trash like three or two times in my life, since I feel movies are actually a way of expression, an art. Therefor even ""bad"" movies deserve to be given a little respect.Now, when you come into a movie that clearly shows no originality or that clearly shows you it was made to ""entertain"" rather than to express, well, that's a different story.And now, when you stumble into sh*t like this. Sh*t man, I don't really know what to say, I can't pull out those fancy words movie critics use and all, but I can tell you the following.The movie is a blatant piece of garbage, not only it is amazingly predictable, and not scary, but it gives you the feeling it's just grotesque porn masked as a scary movie, why?, because you can tell no one gave a sh*t if this scared you or not, it only makes you feel uneasy, but scary?, no.Now there are two types of sadism, the scary one where you know you're just f*cked because all the odds are against you, and the stupid one where you spend twice the time getting gutted out than actually being caught.When it comes to explanations about what the hell is going on, the movie is poor, but when it comes to shower in virgins blood and make a girl suffer, this movie is on top.How can you tell?, well, first of all, why the hell did they have to do the shower scene!?, for f*ck sake it's not scary it's just mental.And the ending?!, what kind of f*cking ending is that?!.I've got a transcript of the director and his friend speaking while working on the ending.""man, I'm bored, let's kill someone in the movie"" ""uh.. I know!, one of the two Americans!, we only need one"" ""yeah!"" ""And how will we explain it?"" ""uh.. I dunno, think of something"" ""Yeah, who cares, what about how he dies?"" ""oh I've got a sh*t load of ideas""Then when you think the movie was lost into unnecessary violence, comes the final scene.""She's gonna chop my balls!"" I mean, what the hell, she supposedly took the time to zip him off , grab some pliers and threaten him to castrate him?, wtf?, is that supposed to make sense?!, why not a bloody knife to the bloody THROAT?!Then the ending fails miserably at making sense by giving us something like this.""I'll buy my way out of here, I waited 'till my blonde friend was dead to let you guys know I'm f*cking rich and I can buy your souls if I wanted to, even though you guys would kill me because there's nothing stopping me from telling every single f*cking authority about what's going on in here after you release me""Maybe they where going to add another brutal kill right after that to deviate attention, y'know, but they forgot since they where too busy adding details to the blood bath scene.In my opinion, don't even bother to download this.",Hostel - Part II
318,mansoor_bashir,Failed to live up to its prequel,5,1 August 2010,"Before watching the film i came here and read all the reviews and saw disappointment. Failing to understand the negativity about the sequel of one of my favorite gore horror films, i decided to watch it anyway. After watching it, i regret not paying heed to the warnings. The movie had gore. But It lacked a story. Hostel 1 had a story that really kept it going. Here, I already know what to expect so the element of surprise is gone.The whole concept of these 3 ""american"" girls escorted by a girl they met in Italy seems JUST like what happened in the first movie. You knew she was the bad person and she'd get them in sooner or later so it just killed it right there. The only reason i kept watching while halfway through was because i wanted to see blood and the ending. I got blood, pretty gruesome blood. 4 points JUST for that. Now the ending. The girl who survives doesn't fight her way out like Paxton had to in the last film. No she just buys her way out by killing just as everyone else bought their way in (isn't that what separated the good guys from the bad guys?). Overall it delivered gore and SOME moments in the beginning (and i'm not referring to the soft core porn), But that's all it did. Find the juicy bits on Youtube and get it over with. This movie isn't worth the time i spent watching it.",Hostel - Part II
319,jas_6978,Better than the first,8,16 June 2007,Okay I am going to start this review by saying that I truly believe that this was a better film than the first one. The first one was only about killing people and I think that this one does a great job of continuing the franchise. It gives us an insight into the minds of the killers and in my mind is a harrowing and disturbing movie experience which deserves a higher rating than 5.6. It does not have the gore factor that many would expect it to and i believe that it is a better movie because of this. It gives it a chance to tell a story rather than just show scenes of graphic violence. Although it does still have two scenes that are guaranteed to make you cringe. Overall a must see movie experience if you enjoy this kind thing.,Hostel - Part II
320,ryanatgeekside,A quick paced continuation on a gore fest set in a realistic setting.,8,9 June 2007,"Warning: This Review contains some spoilers. I will try and keep them to a minimum, but the majority of the spoilers are at the beginning of the film.Hostel Part II takes place only moments after the first film - a survivor's life is still at stake even outside of the dilapidated building that was to be his final place of life, and outside of the city of Slovakia, where apparently anything goes.The feeling that I got from Hostel Part II is that it's not a location in a building that is the bad place; it's the center of a human or several humans, corrupted by money who find people who have a lot of money who are corrupted by hate. This film focus more so on the would-be killers themselves, on their lives, their families, and their golf-swing. They are not all bottom-feeders without passion and a place in society, but upper crest, high-powered lawyers and top positioned businessmen with top-tear roles in society and the top of the line PDAs to boot.While in the first film we are left to wonder who these people are. Who would do such a thing? Why are they doing it and who organized it?, etc. We are shown almost everything there is to know about the goings-on in this underground business deal. That's precisely what it is  a business deal, done in auction form. It's eerily creepy to think it would be so easy to do, as shown in a hilarious montage with the would-be buyers happily and then aggressively plucking away at the keys on their computers, PDAs, cellular phones and laptops, to enter into the bidding war for a human life. The two main successful buyers are Todd played by Richard Burgi, an in-shape, take life by the horns successful business man who treats himself and his shy and passive best friend Stuart, Roger Bart, to the most shocking of a ""guys night out."" It's implied as if these friends have roved the world in search of the next big thrill and have spoken of each other's desire to kill. It just so happens that one finally took the initiative and did it. While my short description of these two fine young gentlemen may not be all that flattering, I can assure you that they are made likable. Well, as likable as possible.There are also the would-be victims. Similar to the backpackers we grew to love in the first installment of Hostel, three college age fresh faced Americans are visiting European countries but for a more admirable reason this time, for art! That's about where the complexity and character back-story ends but its okay. We want to get attached to the characters, but not all the much, right? I mean, they are inevitably going to die or at least be mangled. We want to feel compassion for the characters - at first but be able to move on the next scene as well. The three women are all studying abroad for art, Lauren German plays Beth, the starlet of the film  she comes from a rich line but does not throw that in anyone's face. There's also the atypical sexified Girls-Gone-Wild based Whitney, played by Bijou Philips and the shy and sweet Lorna  a girl who just wants to be loved, played by Heather Matarazzo.With the persuasion of an art-model in Axelle, Vera Jordnova, who may have a thing for Beth, the girls take a detour from their original trip to you guessed it  Slovakia. And then the fun begins.Is this film a sequel? I'd say no, it's more of further installment in a potentially never-ending series. I enjoyed the film's slick style in its no holds barred violence against anyone, at any age. It's inventive carnage, shown in various previously unimaginable ways. It is literally shocking the ways some of these people are tortured. There are some ways I was just perplexed by. This may sound weird, but there is a sort of art to how Eli Roth stages the grisly deaths in these films, most notably the one in which, over a bathtub, blood is seen dripping and sloshing down onto an eager women's body. It's disturbing and hard to try and get into the person's mindset. While not followed by an immediate death scene, the hot springs scene looks great  the smokey water showing the never-ending water. It's really breathtaking.I enjoyed the film from start to finish. For a horror film, the acting was actually pretty good, the film was shot well, and the scenes were staged as good as you could hope for. If you liked the first movie, I think you would like this one even more, if you couldn't stand the first's gore amount, than this may not be the movie for you.Bring the kids! ""Bubble gum!"" 3/4  B I hope you enjoyed my review - I'm open to criticism and love! Ryan Anderson",Hostel - Part II
321,walkingcripple,"Eli Roth is one sick, but amazing director. Hostel 2 is incredible!",2,11 June 2007,"Looking at all these comments from different people, they obviously don't know Eli Roth's work. To me, Roth likes to go to the extreme with his work with a comedic, sick twist. Thats all of what Hostel part 2 had. It had the same aspect as part one, but was different in A lot of ways. The ending was a surprise, it was funny, and didn't expect it to just end right at that point, which made it interesting. An unexpecting movie, very gory, and funny. I'm not going to lie, I expected a more disgusting, and way out of line movie, but I still was not disappointed at all. It took unexpecting turns, and got rid of the really ridiculous people (like the dumb b*tch who seemed to act like a 5 year old, couldn't wait for them to kill her off!) And on that note...Excellent job Eli Roth!",Hostel - Part II
322,luv2pitch69,wow,8,8 June 2007,"Wow i went into a screening of this film with very low expectations. After seeing the first one i wasn't all too impressed with it. I felt like so many other people that it was a bad movie with no plot so they tried to make up for that with lot of boobs and gore.This film though completely blew me out of the water. Eli Roth has definitely stepped it up a notch since hostel. In this one i felt like you actually get to know the characters more and you like the characters and feel bad about what happens to them.The torture scenes have also stepped up a notch. No more just intense scenes thinking are they gonna do it then show nothing they actually go through with it an show it.I Highly encourage everyone to go see this movie. I don't care if you thought the first one was a pile of crap, i promise that you will be thoroughly shocked as i was as to how well this movie is.",Hostel - Part II
323,raiserroofer,"Had potential, but just fell apart.",3,1 December 2007,"To start off I must say that I somewhat liked the first Hostel. Hey, it had a bit of a slow start but at least the character development was mildly convincing. Mildly. Furthermore, the climax of the film was actually intense -- him barely escaping from the actual facility kept me on the edge of my seat.I have to say the exact opposite about Hostel Part II. In not any way in the first 45 minutes of the film (i.e. that entire setup) did I feel any kind of a human connection with any of the victims. Roth failed miserably on that part. However, what I was, at first, was extremely interested in was the story of the killers. The perspective alone was truly original, and it was starting to build up tension to what seemed to be another exciting conclusion.Boy, was I wrong. To begin with, all torture scenes in this film -- all of them -- were downright laughable. As to how anyone could actually get scared/offended/shocked by this garbage is beyond me. I didn't believe the critics when the called it ""torture pornography"", but holy *beep* it actually is just twisted erotica! But that didn't disappoint me the most. My biggest gripe had to be the climax itself, that is as SOON as the one guy changed his mind, somehow snapped and decided he's got balls. It was a comedic drama... with a bit of penis-cutting thrown in for slapstick. Not to mention the game of soccer... what does Roth think the audiences' reaction would be to that? There was a glimmer of hope, especially in the 30 minute to 50 minute gap, but I don't think the film could have actually ended any worse.",Hostel - Part II
324,jacqueline-vanarsdall,Hostel Part 2 - Worth Price of Admission,8,8 June 2007,"Don't want to give it away...just in CASE I put spoilers in, here is my ""review"" of Hostel II: I've read comments here on IMDb AND on Fandango from a lot of folks who have (and some who haven't) seen this film. ""Hostel"" was a huge disappointment...especially because 'Cabin Fever' was hilariously put together (no matter how tongue in cheek, pun intended). Eli Roth has, with 'Hostel 2', finally EARNED the right to be BROUGHT TO US by Quentin Tarantino. This is despite the fact that one of my favorite character actors is Richard Burgi (Sentinel, Cellular, In Her Shoes, etc...) though he does manage to ""fall to pieces"" in this incarnation of his gorgeousness. (Hey, I'm a fanfic author...give me a damn break!) Though there are still seemingly delayed periods of action in ""Hostel 2"", the performances demand critical attention...and deservedly so. Scripted ever-so-much-better than its predecessor, ""Hostel 2"" delivers just what it promises...and then some. Gore is not over the top, and all the FX are enough to make you squirm, yet laugh at the same time - providing you have a sense of humor to begin with, of course. And, if you DON'T have a sense of humor...just what the %!@* are you doing here to begin with?!!! :0) ENJOY this film...it's the closest escape from Iraq War and Mainstream Big Screen Whoreism that you're likely to encounter this Summer.Jvan",Hostel - Part II
325,bynnda,Utter rubbish,3,3 June 2007,"The original was pretty objectionable but worked because it had a believable set up and a nightmarish feel. Mostly this was the result of telling us absolutely nothing about the business behind the tortures.Turns out it's just a weekend getaway for rich businessmen who want an alternative to the usual golfing trip. The idea that it isn't an obscure, underground place for a few random psychos but is in fact an organised and efficiently run business is both ridiculous and laughable.Not that the rest of the film is any better. The script is terrible, and the entire first half of the film almost completely irrelevant (including a lengthy sequence on a train that is straight out of the worst straight to video movies).Worse still, the torture scenes are now camp and cartoonish rather than raw and visceral as they were in the original.",Hostel - Part II
326,davisdogg32,It was OK...,6,1 June 2007,"So I got a chance to check it out. At first, I liked how the movie got away from the soft-core porn as was the first half of Hostel. When the first torture scene begins, I have to say it kind of made me sick to my stomach a little bit...Im sure the effect Roth was going for. Then comes the rest of the film... The movie took too much of a violent, yet quirky turn and I found myself laughing at the torture scenes. All of a sudden, the movie goes from serious to ""oops...look what just happened!"" The tense moments were gone and it lost me there. The acting was OK, the story a little too rushed towards the end, and an ending that was far too comedic for me... The first half of the film was good, but the second became something completely different and that's why I can only give it 6 out of 10 stars.",Hostel - Part II
327,gurlpwr19,What happened?,1,10 January 2008,"Was Eli scared to kill any girls here? This was quite a watered down approach to making a horror film I had ever seen. It felt like he was scared to have any women killed by men - and I'm a girl. I hope they don't make another one ever again. The first one had more of a story and point to it. What was the purpose in bringing Jay Hernandez's character back just to kill him right away? The first film had scenes where it showed the killers taking the victims apart. None of that in this one with the exception of another chick sitting in a bath tub slicing away this weaselly little girl - even that didn't show much. The kids in the gang now appear to be a bunch of pussies that are afraid of a guy with a gun? Last film they were throwing rocks at two guys with guns. Another thing - people don't want to see a girl talking to some old guy in a mansion or talking to some guy at a party, they want to see the victims getting torn apart unless they thought this was PS I Love You.There is no reason to see this film whatsoever. This is the first film severely watered down.",Hostel - Part II
328,bowerqueen2002,This is directed towards everyone who DIDN'T like this film,10,5 July 2007,"I have read some of these unusual comments and have to say I am quite insulted! I have been watching horror movies since I was 5, and I had quite a few nightmares back then, now that I'm all grown up, nothing scares me anymore! I have been waiting for so long, begging for directors and writers to make a movie that is ACTUALLY scary! Not just loud noises that catch you off guard, but bone chilling, creepy scary that gets under your skin and haunts you! Now, this particular movie was targeted at me, and people like me, who aren't scared of anything, and love to watch bloody sadistic gory stuff! I read someone's post that thought Eli Roth should be tried for murder as ""only a psychopath could even think of this"" HAHAHAHAHA sorry but that's funny! The movie was NOT targeted at your type of audience, so go back to watching steel magnolias and leave the horror for us! I absolutely loved this movie! It's about damn time a movie actually scared me in some way. It has a great story line,it's very real, very believable (i hate when horror flicks are so far fetched) and very horrifying. I think he did a GREAT job, it was WAY better than the first and I am a HUGE Tarantino fan so that is saying a lot. So as for everyone who didn't like it or think it's just plain wrong...there are us twisted sick F***'s who enjoyed it! and WE are who it's truly made for....so thank you Eli for making a great movie, hope to see more of your twisted ideas on the big screen soon! Can't Wait!",Hostel - Part II
329,Virus77,Roth lacks Intelligence and I've lost all faith,1,23 October 2007,"I have just painfully sat, wanting to fast forward through the same boring 45 minute intro as the first Hostel up to the supposedly disgusting and shocking climax. And needless to say the climax was disgusting but not in a way I think Roth was hoping. For months I've waited to rent this DVD and you know what, thats $4.25 and 90 some minutes of my life I can never get back. Much like the first, it was nothing more than a child's idea to break the ""moral"" rules and create something taboo by combining sexuality with extreme violence. To top this off, they added what is continually been named ""slap-stick humor"" into the entire torture half of the film. Sex, Violence, and Humor have never mixed at the extremes. Movies like this try to recreate amazing pictures like the ORIGINAL ""Saw"" or ""Seven"" and you know what, they should just stop trying. Its unfortunate that people consider this film entertainment; it lacks intelligence and shames the horror genre. I'd be truthfully embarrassed to have my name printed next to directed and WRITTEN on the front. Truth be told... Roth is running out of chances - terrible flick.",Hostel - Part II
330,pjamese3,I liked this movie,7,19 June 2009,"The 1st Hostel movie was pure torture porn. This one was less so. And although I could see places where it could have been done better, it wasn't that bad a movie.Get past the politically correct crap. What interested me in this movie was, of course, knowing what was going to happen. The director didn't play like everything was going to be a shock. Instead, he let us see the goings on in the murder club. The bidding war for the American brunette, was well done. I can see bored, rich guys doing that. The characters could have been more fleshed out, but this isn't a serious drama. It's a gore movie. They were adequate. The ""Lady Bathory"" scene was very well done. I actually liked that it wasn't just the men who were participating in this club.Of special note were the two friends who bought 2 of the 3 American women. Their inclinations at first seemed to match the characters we've seen those actors play before, but then the one who was psyched for the torture/murder lost his nerve when it became too real and he drew blood. And the one who was being reluctantly bullied into doing this turned out to have more psychological reasons to murder a brunette woman and actually became more hard core than his friend.And the reversal near the end... I had to pause the tape and recover from sympathetic pains while my wife was cracking jokes. Then when I started the movie up again, I saw the girl toss his stuff to the dog?!! He deserved it, but still...damn! As far as the end of the movie goes, someone brought up that the female lead bought into the idea of the murder club. I don't think so. Her murder of her captor was to get out of the dungeon alive. She may have had some satisfaction in it, but didn't kill him for sport. The beheading of the model who set the 3 women up was simply revenge.Not the most socially redeeming movie, but if you look at it as just a summer entertainment, Hostel II meets its goals.",Hostel - Part II
331,moranis-2,Flabby sequel to a great modern horror...,3,4 June 2007,"I was and am a huge fan of the original HOSTEL but alas the second installment follows the tradition of 'Blair Witch 2' and 'Hills Have Eyes 2' - entering the annals of poor horror sequels.What's wrong with it? Well for starters it opens with an 'Alien 3' beginning (if u know what I am saying) that is handled REALLY badly leaving the viewer thinking this MUST be a red herring due to it's lazy ham-fistedness.. it isn't.The 'company' are now revealed to be so large and infinitely widespread and catering to so many clients that it is clear that many victims are required for these privileged customers - stretching the original believability of the secret, underground nature of their operation to breaking point. (This point is not helped by the fact that they seem to leave many dead bodies lying around..) Gone is the creepy claustrophobic feel, replaced by more of an 'Illuminati' type bent. Unfortunately it doesn't wash..The protagonists you don't get to know half as well as the boys from Part 1 and, for Eli Roth, the characters are surprisingly wafer thin and humorless (Sensible One, Party Girl, Nerdy Virgin - real 'Friday 13th' type stuff). Plus; on a totally 'red blooded heterosexual' note (and I do apologize) the only member of the gang we see naked is the Nerd from 'Welcome To the Dollhouse'! When the first unfortunate girl of the group is tortured I couldn't help holding it up to Josh's scene in the original - it cannot compare. With Josh you were wincing and praying for him to somehow escape, feeling for him with every slice and stab. Almost bringing you to tears. Part 2's first kill only has the same affect as driving past squirming road kill. You stare at it feeling a bit sick, your stomach turns and then you move on. The experience just isn't half as emotionally involving.The pacing is all over the place too, with the elements that I thought were going be fascinating (the story through the 'customer' eyes) becoming rather predictable; adding nothing new with very little inventiveness.And seeing that this is (reportedly) the LAST of the Hostel movies, it does not tie anything up, end the 'problem' or leaves us flabbergasted - it just leaves you deflated and questioning the protagonist's future motives. It is VERY difficult to root for a main character that solves their problem with MONEY! When I saw the original HOSTEL I was really rooting for Jay Hernandez when he escaped from the Factory and I had to stop myself from punching the air in the cinema during the sequence where he runs over the double-crossing hookers. There are NO moments like that in HOSTEL Part 2.It just feels like a Saw sequel directed by Rob Zombie.",Hostel - Part II
332,jopket,Never seen sh** like that!,1,5 July 2007,"Man I liked Hostel Part I, I gave it a ""9"" if I can remember right.But this 2nd part is absolute rubbish. No story, 3 girls instead of 3 guys and 4 gore scenes. Sometimes I had to look away, absolutely disgusting. Roth just thought, I make the 2nd part simply a bit more violent, that's what people want to see. I remind you of the boy, absolutely disgusting, this is all you have to say about that ""movie"". It's a shame, they called it ""Hostel : Part II"" and it's a shame for the first Part, that there are people giving this one a ""10"".If I was you, I wouldn't pay for that kind of sh**!btw: I don't think children can kick around a woman's head.",Hostel - Part II
333,keith-b,Better than the first,7,8 June 2007,"Hostel part II has many of the same elements that made the first a hit, without the irrational actions of the main players. Sure, you wanted all of them to die in original, because the they acted so stupidly. Here you have characters that are much stronger, and therefore you care more about them. (Can you tell I prefer this to part one?) For those of you not considering this because of the original, please give it a chance. Sure, the genre is the same, but it's got better story telling, more insight behind the scenes of the factory, and in general, it's a more cohesive piece. While not perfect, but it's good, gory, completely over-the-top fun.",Hostel - Part II
334,fitayaninr,Great,7,30 August 2020,"So many scene in this sekuel similar to the original Hostel (2005). So I'm not get suprised again. But I love this because Hostel was sold based on the premise that it was going to be shockingly disgusting, but was underwhelming in terms of gore (at least to me). Hostel: Part II was sold as something more suspenseful, and it works hard to develop both a sense of tension for both the fates of the girls and the fates of the two Americans who may or may not have the balls to follow through on what they paid for.",Hostel - Part II
335,spider254,An OK film but does let the Hostel series down!,3,13 June 2007,"The real problem with this film is you don't see any real torture scenes, that may sound sick but that is what this film is about and it doesn't live up to it. Yes you see little scenes but there none like in Hostel 1 where you get a full scene from the person waking up to the person being dead. To be honest it isn't even gory compared to films such as Saw III.The next problem this film has is revealing too much about how the ""Hunting Club"" works, what made the 1st film good is because of the mystery behind this Hostel where people were being tortured. We didn't really know who these people were and why they were there. That is what made it interesting. With Hostel Part II we are told everything about this Hunting club, we even meet the owner and he is in quite a few scenes. The whole movie just feels too open to be enjoyable, again in the 1st film we just saw one of the main characters wake up chained to a chair and then he was killed, we didn't know anything about the reason behind his death. By all means watch this film if you enjoyed 1st film but don't expect it to live up to the hype.One of the films positive parts is the acting, the characters are very believable, the best performances were from Beth (lauren German) and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), they both played the characters very well and I did feel sorry for them in their ""death"" scenes, the other main character Whitney (Bijou Phillips)was OK but in my opinion her character wasn't as believable as the two. If i do have any negative comments about the characters its the types of characters they are. I mean you have the sensible, rich Beth and then you have the Slutty, hard faced bitch Witney and then the quiet geeky one Lorna. This to me just seems too typical, like it was written by a teenager. Overall the performances through out the movie were good, just to bad the plot wasn't.*SPOILER* Right at the end of the film we see Beth decapitate Axel, that whole scene to me is just stupid, I mean if you escaped from the Hostel then why would you go and chop off the girls head with a massive sword wouldn't you just get the f**k out of Slavakia, to me that scene just feels pointless and Stupid. Another stupid scene is when Paxton girlfriend gets up to find him sat in the kitchen with no head. I mean what is that about, how would they know where Paxton is assuming he's gone back to America, and when Beth finds the owners Head collection that just made me laugh, why would you have a head collection from your victims in your mansion. Anyway my rant is over, go see the film, just don't expect any academy awards.",Hostel - Part II
336,PartyWithYourHeartOut,"Started off well, then fell flat on it's ass",4,7 June 2007,"During the first ten or so minutes of Hostel 2, i was sitting there thinking 'wow this is gonna be a hell of a lot better than the first' The only surviving character from the first film, Paxton, returns, found on a train by the Russian feds. He is then interrogated in a Hospital by the Russian government, asking about what happened in the Hostel. He informs them about the bloodhound tattoo all the killers have, the man interrogating him replying 'you mean this tattoo' in a classic cliché horror way. And then he wakes up, and he's lying in bed next to his wife. It was a nightmare. Oh god i did not see that coming. Paxton and his wife argue, you then see her in bed alone and being woken by a noise outside. She goes to her balcony and see's the gardener trimming a tree with a chainsaw (if you didn't see what was going to happen next, then this film could prove a treat for you). She then wanders the house shouting for Paxton, and finally wanders into the kitchen where he is sitting. Oh yeah, and his head is gone. Those first 10 or so minutes were the best part of the film for me, and even they were cliché ridden, predictable and seen it all before. So if that's the best part of the film, what's the rest like? Well essentially, it's the first film all over again. But seriously, ALL OVER AGAIN. A group of travellers (this time three girls) meet somebody who tells them about this great place (this time not a sex Hostel, but a spa - see what they did there? Girls don't want Hostels, they want Spas) and they go there. One by one they're picked off in stupid (albeit, sometimes shocking) ways, until the final girl, who escapes (obviously). This film was pointless. If you've seen the first one, there is no point in seeing this (which is funny because people who go to see this will more than likely have seen the first). Sure, it has it's share of disgusting moments (although nowhere near as much as the first, and i thought even the first lacked in the disgusting factor it promised), and the appearances of not one, but TWO characters from Desperate Housewives did make me chuckle, and they played their parts well, but it doesn't stop it from being a bad film. If this was executed differently, it could have been rather brilliant, just like the first film. But it wasn't, and it isn't. It's yet another teen horror film that will be seeing bargain bins around the world in a few years. 4/10",Hostel - Part II
337,ncw2727,Only 1 good part in this sequel,3,11 June 2007,"So I have been anticipating this movie since the original released trailer in Saw III, and I can say that I am disappointed. This one was not nearly as good as the first and I think it is because Quentin took over more in this one. Eli Roth basically created the original movie by himself with Quentin's name in it as a promotional tool. When Quentin saw the success of Hostel, he probably tried to take control of this one. Anyone who saw this can agree with me that it was more of a Quentin style film. And the ending (don't worry, I wont spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it) left me with confirmation that the movie flopped.OK, so that is my general input on the movie, however, I do want to speak about a part in the movie that might have been some of the best cinematography I have seen in a while. The part where the two guys are in the elevator heading to the basement torture chambers. The small orchestra music mixed with the semi-slow motion camera capture and the unforgettable facial expressions and body language of the two, really made you feel exactly what they felt. I must give credit where credit is due, and this is definitely one of those spots.",Hostel - Part II
338,adkijd6,"Really, really bad.",1,8 June 2007,"The first Hostel was a joke of a movie. What sets the first Hostel apart from Hostel Part II is that the first was laughably bad while Part II was a complete waste of two hours without any comedic relief such as the obviously fake dangling eyeball in the first. Also, if one thought the acting in the first one couldn't have been worse, Part II manages to outdo its precursor. It is truly a shame to know that another trashy American ""horror"" movie such as Hostel Part II will have so many viewers when it is nothing but a useless monstrosity of scenes with gratuitous gore. This review is not an advocate of the absence of gore in horror films. For example, Silence of the Lambs and Se7en are two fantastic movies with intriguing plots and good acting. Hostel Part II is the complete opposite. It seems as though this ""up and coming"" Eli Roth got hammered one night, got in front of his laptop, and wrote a pathetic story with aimlessly inserted scenes of nudity and gore while hiring ONE OF THE WORST CASTS EVER. Quentin, it's a marvel that you allow your name to appear in the same credits as this amateur who probably should own an adult novelty item store instead of being a film director. Oh, and to the readers, please don't watch it. There is nothing to be gained.",Hostel - Part II
339,robertjepson27,"Freaky, Hilarious, Horrific, and just.....Great",10,9 June 2007,I went into this movie expecting everything and anything to happen. The first one in my opinion is better because its the first but i wont take anything away from the first. The characters aren't really built great. Bijou Phillips sucks. She cant scream she is more of a winer. The actor Todd something is hilarious and I found myself laughing when he was on screen every time. So props to him. By the end I found by self saying what the f***!! holy! it was quite a surprise and i have never seen anything like this ending EVER! I say that everyone should see this movie for a whole new experience in horror. I bet you will come out of this flick as amazed i as was. Love It!,Hostel - Part II
340,kgoods21,This movie is not entertaining and it is not a movie,1,8 June 2007,I think that Eli Roth should be tried for conspiracy to commit murder because no one less than a psychopathic murderer can create a movie like this. This is beyond sadistic this wrong and truthfully should not be shown in theaters. Our society has come to an all time low for allowing this movie to be shown. All this is Satan's wet dream. I'm not that much of a practicing Christian but this movie is beyond immoral. I like horror movies and gore but this was too over the top and down right disgusting. I recommend this movie to absolutely no one and if anybody reads this comment and still sees the movie is just giving money to a scumbag.,Hostel - Part II
341,chs1989,"good movie, but here is why i like #1 more",7,24 June 2007,"I just want to point out that this is my first review, so i hope this helps you.First of all let me start of why I like Hostel part 1 more. First reason is the fact that this is a sequel, you know when a ""scary"" scene is coming up, you know something bad will happen. In hostel one you had no idea what was going on unless you had a friend who told you every freaking detail. Hostel one gave me and still freaks me out. Hostel two i went into theaters hoping to be freaked out of my mind. I did not get the thrills, sorry huge fans but i wasn't. The bath scene and the end torture scene made me cringe. I will say that hostel 2 definitely has less nudity than the first movie and i am kind of glad, because now at least its not Hostel 1 where the first 30 minutes is a pure porn fest. The plot i think is surprisingly better. Hostel 2 really helps the audience get to know the characters. Hostel part 2 also explains how the whole organization of the Elite Hunters works. And i thought that scene was very well done. And one other thing, the guy who is shown as the main torturer, congratulations man. That guy freaked me out. That was some amazing acting. He really acts like this purely disgusting torture events is an exciting life thrilling experience. who in the world can pull that role off? I tell you, he sure did. that takes some skill ha ha. i also just wish there was some more scary scenes, like eye scene in #1, i still squirm from that. For the fans who want a really violent movie, this will give you half of what your expecting, even though the scenes of torture do get you to be like ""omg thats got to hurt"", its just not what hostel one gave you. but overall, a well done movie, you should enjoy it. I hope this helps you guys",Hostel - Part II
342,jovanc-1,"Kill, Lunacy, Tarantino, Typical",1,9 June 2007,"Story at hostel 1 doesn't continue at all in this part. The main actor just appears in the second movie and does the ""How I'm scared"" part, which is typical for Tarantino movies. I'm sad that this story didn't continue in the second part but it did in some way of chopping around people who reminded death-row realist what do they hate about their private life. Tarantino is of the hook for real. He shouldn't be let directing these sick films ever again, instead, he should be lock in a basement and realize he is being too sick (even I imagined what delusional mind could ever come up with this idea of a ""Film"") Last few movies I viewed (amongst the others ""The Grindhouse"" and ""Kill Bill(1)(2)(3)..."") was the same chop-chop survey like this. It should end by bad votes. This man gotta stop killing people of his own lunacy and childhood. It's really no more fun for Us viewers. This gotta end !!! Conclusion: - Do not include recall yours memories or even your sick imaginations (yeah, jeez, I admit it is tempting but even too imaginary.. too .. tooo much... ). I think He should focus more of an real story (if he is making a horror movie). Good luck with watching this movie!!!",Hostel - Part II

The two actors that portray the torturers weren't very convincing or scary or much of anything else. I didn't really look away during any of the scenes. I actually find myself hoping that everyone would die so the movie would end. There is always so much hype around these movies and it makes all horror movies goers want to check it out and then blah!

344,gerardwayismyway,it was good...but WOW,8,15 June 2007,"I definitely thought this movie was better than the first, just for the fact that more was explained than in the first one. After seeing Hostel about a year or o ago, i was so confused at the ending...i was wondering why there were so many tits and massive amounts of blood. Don't get me wrong...there are still a few tit shots and PLENTY of blood in Hostel: Part Two, but this time it seemed appropriate. The thing about Part Two is that it really creeped me out because so many people are in on it and are involved that it just makes me want to second think everyone i know! don't see this alone...you'll need someone to go to the bathroom with you when you start to gag =]",Hostel - Part II
345,mbrooks1-1,"Hostel 2 left me emotionally scarred, but not speechless",10,2 June 2007,"""Hostel"" was a movie that took me forever to watch. One day at about 4:20 pm, my three friends and I magically decided to watch the unrated version. Despite my overwhelming revulsion, I didn't turn it off and was very surprised. ""Hostel"" was a movie that snuck underneath my radar. I went into this screening of ""Hostel 2"" (no 4:20 showing this time, natch) with actually very high expectations, and I was blown away. To me it is one of the best horror films in the past 10 years, including the original, and that's saying a lot. And I refuse to be one of those people to ruin the surprises. I also feel comfortable in saying that anyone that does not appreciate the twists in the movie has a very limited view of human beings.What sets this movie apart from almost every other film in the genre is Eli Roth's gift for making very believable and human characters caught up in these primal emotions and situations. ""Hostel 2"" does not let up on the tension and by the time the last dog had its day, I couldn't decide whether or not I was queasy from extreme gore or the tension that just keeps getting ratcheted up tighter. I can't really say anything bad about the film. There are no stupid ""boo"" scares, and the characters are so believable and likable that it only adds to the terror that starts in the pit of your stomach the minute you realize you care about these girls, and you know what's going to happen to them. But you really don't! Eli Roth is very good at loss leaders and red herrings, but he never leaves you just hanging (special joke). This movie promises a massive payoff and it delivers like a head in a box. All three of the female leads and the two male ""Desperate Housewives"" leads (George, the dead pharmacist and Teri Hatcher's ex-husband) are all immensely talented and help to raise the level of awareness of the quality of true horror films, a genre that is sorely unappreciated. Magnificently shot, acted, written, directed, etc., ""Hostel 2"" just surpassed all of my expectations. The only negative thing I have to say is that, unfortunately, a great deal of people will never be able to see this movie, and I understand that. This is not for everybody. After the first kill, my friend and I whispered to each other in the silent theatre asking each other if we wanted to go, but I am so glad we stuck it out. The pay off was everything I wanted and more. I can't believe I am actually writing this, but ""Hostel 2"" was brilliant, just bring anti-nausea pills.",Hostel - Part II
346,ChuckNoblett,Extremely Disappointing,3,2 June 2007,"This was a real step backwards for Roth in terms of quality. The narrow yet realistic dialog of the first movie is gone, the acting is WAY over the top here and the specific plot points so illogical, you will end up laughing at this film toward the end.Roth went much more with a ""less is more"" approach in Hostel I in terms of intent-related dialog and revealing the overall structure and schema of the antagonists. As it turns out, that was the right way to go for Roth -- attempting more was way too big of a bite to chew for him, leaving an unintentionally extremely silly film.It left logical holes and flat out embarrassing plot implosions everywhere.Also, the subtleties of the first film are gone.The gypsy street kids -- a great plot point of Hostel I -- are back. They're now far more cartoonish than before, and not even in the street.",Hostel - Part II
347,szittyafergeteg,one more ridiculous film,1,1 July 2007,"I can't stop laughing when i come across a movie like this one.Why does anybody write a screenplay without the minimal knowledge about the places whereto he places the idiotic story, about the folks and local customs?There are so much mistakes throughout the movie, that to list those all should be longer than the scenario itself.If you next time want to write about Slovakia (or Bohemia, Austia, Bavaria, Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia...) then please, go there, look around, it is not so expensive to rest there for 2 weeks, and take long walks and trips.Why are you then disagreed with the various USA-conceptions around the world, which are mostly like these Central Europe conceptions??? By the way, those come too from idiotic films about the American nation of zombies.This is the real imbecility and darkness in minds, not the horror.",Hostel - Part II
348,kaksibe,What do you expect from a blockbuster?,2,5 June 2007,"I watched the movie couple of days ago and I absolutely didn't get surprised by the low quality of the product ('cause Hostel, both part 1 and 2 is just a commercial machine and nothing more, at least according my personal point of view). I'm an Italian guy who lives in Eastern Europe (Sofia - Bulgaria), so I could say I know quite well both the locations and, for a certain degree, the cultures which the movie takes place: 1) Italy is presented as a beautiful nation, but the people are drawn in such a stereotypical way that it was even embarrassing to me to hear what they were saying or singing (hymn to sex and so on)... It was even funnier to see so many guys with the A.S. Rome's jersey... I'm not here to defend my own country at all (I know that we are famous worldwide for our passion for sex and football...), it's not the goal, but it was so cheap a representation of Italy that I couldn't not get impressed. 2) Why the actors made so many mistakes speaking in Italian? It wasn't even grammatically correct. Who wrote the dialogs? 3) The Eastern European folklore is pretty far way from how it has been presented in the movie. Ask, for example, a Slovakian whether they drink ""sidro"" during their celebrations... The traditional feast seemed to me a portrait of an old fashion American fan fair... 4) When the plot is so basic (we are talking about a sequel, so nobody expected any radical innovations), the cure for the details has to be determinant: knowing two or three things about a country where you decide to settle a movie is not a crime, but Hostel seems to forget that Europe is not just an Hollywood studio, but continent with its own history and culture. 5) If you want to watch a creepy movie which investigates tortures and human perversions, think of Ichi the Killer, Old Boy, The Brave, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. It will be worth. Peace Ale",Hostel - Part II

350,cwright86,Roth dominates the horror industry.,10,9 June 2007,"Eli Roth actually made a horror sequel that was better than the first! This movie has just about everything. It was disturbing, without being to unrealistic. The characters were less believable than the first, but it was a fair trade to humanize the ""clients"". The violence was definitely over-the-top, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. And just when you think you have everything pieced together, Eli pulls the rug out from under you. Sick, twisted, depraved, BRILLIANT! Also, I would like to say something about the previous comments. You can't honestly say that the ""Hostel"" series isn't the most innovative line of films in the last decade. Films like ""Wolf Creek"", ""The Hitcher"", and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" did not have half the passion that this movie did.",Hostel - Part II
351,ludwigvanbuddtwang,Most Satisfying Sequel in a Summer Full Of Disappointing Ones,9,11 June 2007,"It's strange that the critics who are giving this movie bad reviews aren't even giving an argument. They're simply saying it's ""crud"" and ""torture porn."" They are complaining that there is too much violence, while fans complain that there isn't enough. I strongly believe that this film deserves more credit than it's receiving. I also read a user comment on IMDb that said this film had the worst cast ever. That almost makes me think that the person did not see the movie.The cast was the strongest aspect of the movie. German, Phillips, and Matarazzo were pretty damn perfect for their roles. They are the three leads, but the core of the film is the duo of Richard Burgi and Roger Bart. I knew they both looked kind of creepy but I had no idea they could act so well. Lionsgate did a very good thing by not pressuring Eli Roth into casting huge stars. I can honestly say that Burgi and Bart give the best performances in any horror movie I've seen in a long time. I also love how Roth wrote their characters. They were very real and believable because they're not just evil villains, they are family men. I thought I knew exactly where the characters were going, but Roth was successful in surprising me. I found it very entertaining to watch these two characters unravel. In addition to the main characters, the many offbeat minor characters were freaking amazing. I'm not certain at the moment who was in charge of casting, but to whoever was, I salute you. There are countless new characters with great faces, as well as the return of the desk clerk, who is surprisingly menacing. Roth also knows that he owes a lot to Italian cinema from the 70s and 80s. He's cast two famous actors from that period, as well as the director of the most infamous movie of all time. Their cameos were very (for lack of a much better word) good. I also have to mention the bubblegum gang. This time, the kids are interwoven nicely into the narrative. Their scenes were comedic but also had genuine emotional impact.It is easy to notice that the photography, editing, and set designs of this film are much improved from the original. Unlike in the Saw films, the viewer is not distracted by these elements. Instead, the experience is enhanced. I was quite impressed.I respect Roth much more as a filmmaker after this movie. There are several awesome montages, which I'm always a sucker for. He also constantly builds up our expectations (and, based on his other movies, we think everything will go according to plan) only to shatter them and fulfill in them in another way. This, in my opinion, is the way to go because it's both surprising and satisfying.All in all, this movie offers SO much more than most horror sequels. Saw II, even though it was very successful, went in the direction of most horror sequels, focusing more and more on the killings instead of the people involved. Hostel Part II does the opposite, similar to Kill Bill. Fans may be disappointed that the torture scenes are shorter than in the first, but I think Roth handles the material wisely in most instances. And, yes, the girls' story is almost a mirror image of the boys' in the original, but it all feels fresh since we get to watch their journey knowing what's happening every step of the way.The introduction with Jay Hernandez is one of the only things feels like something that's done in a lot of sequels. He should have been given more to do. It wouldn't have been necessary, but it would have been more interesting. His scenes here feel kind of forced, even though they're well done.Oh, and about that ending. I didn't know how to feel at first. Roth has been promising so much. My first words after the movie were, ""That wasn't the most shocking ending in history!"" But the more I think about it, the more I love it. It's not a twist like I was expecting, although there is a nice twist in the climax. The final scene is very entertaining, however straight-forward it may be. It's still more fun than watching a bunch of billionaires steal money.",Hostel - Part II
352,cmg312,disappointing,2,15 June 2007,"We really expected more drama, more action and more fear this movie did not provide any of this, It was very disappointing it started off on a good foot bringing prior character back but stopped abruptly and continued with a whole new story line. What happened to the girlfriend? Was kind of comical at points which we did not appreciate. The story line was boring and there was definitely not enough action or killing like we saw in the first movie It was not at all what we expected from a part 2 First movie was definitely better it had more action you covered your eyes on the violence and cheered for the characters to be saved. It was much more intense. because it was believable this chapter was too low key with no surprises.",Hostel - Part II

Second of all, it's absurd that Hostell II is rated R as it should have unquestionably received a rating of NC-17.Penis should never be shown in a movie unless it's a porno. As i sat in the theater i noticed 5 children under the age of 9 years old.Something's wrong there. For the love of God let it rest and don't make a third movie.

It was more bloody than anything.It was nice to know a little of the back ground on how they are set up to do this to the young men and women who stay in these hostels. Obviously there will be a third one with how it ended, Which i didn't like. It was more cheesy than scary to me. I can honestly say i will never go to those countries as a tourist. Even though i know this is fiction. Heathers Scene where she is hanging upside down was awful..she did a wonderful job at it though.

We were all in amazement that the movie ended the way it did. I enjoyed the first Hostel, but this one was just awful. An hour and a half of my life was wasted last night......... The movie started off OK, but after that, the movie just didn't give you that intense feeling like it gave you in the first one. Something to keep you on the edge of your seat. Both Hostels were similar, but so very different. It seems as if the director tried too hard to keep up with SAW. If you like gore, then this just may be the movie for you.

Brilliant acting, especially Roger Bart (who always delivers in everything he's in). I do still think Cabin Fever is Eli Roth's masterpiece, but I actually liked this as well. I read the other reviews other people have written on IMDb and I don't know what the problem is. They keep saying it was offensive, too much of a porn and too violent and gory?! WHAT?!1. There was hardly ANY nude scenes in this, compared to Hostel: Part 1 (which almost everybody seemed to like) 2. There was one particular scene I might call gory (even though it wasn't) and that's when that guy eats the flesh of that other guy's leg. In number one you see finger's being chopped off, a guy going mental with a chainsaw, etc.etc.. 3. If you thought this movie was OFFENSIVE(?!?!), this sort of horror genre is not for you. Don't blame it on the movie. Don't blame it on Eli Roth.Even Eli said it on the Hostel: Part 1 DVD: ""If you're not into this film genre, Hostel is not for you. Don't put yourself through it."" (Not a quotation by the way, just as I remember it.)I liked it much more than Hostel: Part 1. This one had a better storyline, great character development (especially Roger Bart's Stuart) and it actually felt like a genuine movie instead of your common horror/torture flick.I LOVED IT!

I think it's a disgrace to Tarentino's name that's he has his name attached to this movie. Yhe acting is so bad and the story is as thin as a cracker. I think it's funny to see how they spend so much time to build the so called story up and then when they are about to show us everything hostel is known for which is nasty gore and human molesting in the creepy basement the movie suddenly can't end fast enough.

359,mingotiger86-1,just saw this movie....my 2 cents..AWFUL!,2,4 November 2007,"****** I don't know if this will contain spoilers or not, but I figured I would put this on here just in case********************* Well I just rented this movie last night and wanted to comment on it. I was a BIG fan of Hostel and really wanted to go to the movies to see part 2 but waited until it came out. I must say I was severely disappointed. If I had gone to the movies to see it, I would have been highly upset.This was nowhere as good as the first one. Hostel was fairly believable and flowed very well. This part II was so cheesy. I don't know if it was the bad acting (thank you Bijou) or the story but man it was bad. I think Roth must have cut out a lot of key points throughout the movie when he was editing it. Thats the only explanation as to how some scenes were left so mangled. Especially the end where it jumps from Beth walking away after killing Stuart, then showing a small snippet of her getting the tattoo and then killing the girl that brought them there with no explanation. What? I mean I can understand what happened but the thought process made no sense at all. If she was a member at that point, why not have them kidnap that woman and bring her in so she could torture her? That is what they did after all.And how did she fall asleep in the hot springs for so long that everyone was gone when she woke up? Did the woman have sleeping powder on her lips so when she kissed her shoulder she passed out? OK, i'm kidding about that, but I think it was from that point I lost interest. Too many questions left unanswered.Not a good sequel. Roth could have done better. However, Hostel is still awesome.",Hostel - Part II

As far as Hostel 2, I couldn't watch past the first 30 minutes. I was so damn bored that I didn't even care to see the torture scenes. I guess because I felt I knew what was going to happen and the first 30 minutes was just to get the audience to the point where the girls get tricked. That's where it's fails, people seeing this movie know about the first movie and this movie would have been better as an explanation to who are bloodhound torture group or even better, make the movie from their point of view. Sorry Eli but I was bored and your time would have been better spent making Thanksgiving into full length film. That would have been awesome.",Hostel - Part II
361,rjhjrt916,"Overall enjoyable, but seeing original Hostel makes it better",7,19 November 2007,"Okay, I have to start by saying I completely disagree with the first guy that gave this movie 0 stars. This isn't ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption"", but for Horror this is pretty good, and about as plot driven as a Horror movie can be without being labeled Suspense or Drama. Okay, so I've gotta say that the first Hostel is somewhat lame, although to be fair it hasn't been done before, and is pretty much ""torture porn"". And I mean come on, as sick and twisted as it is, those guys are total douschbags. With Hostel II, we're dealing with girls, and 2 of which are really sweet/nice. Note to reader: watching the first Hostel sets you up beautifully for Hostel II. It's not nearly as gruesome, and way more plot driven. Hostel II takes you ""behind the scenes"" of the Slovakian Bloodhound torture business, which makes the story more interesting. There are two definite twists, with a pretty cool ending. Also, due to the fact that we are dealing with 3 woman, the brutality is taken into effect. There is more suspense, and ""ahhh, if only you knew!!"" type of moments in Hostel II, but only if you see the first one of course. So, yes, I would recommend this movie to someone who would like to see a worthwhile horror movie, with some twists, not a whole lot of gruesome gore, and even some eroticism ... Mrs. Bathory ;). Which was a great scene by the way!",Hostel - Part II

That along with Grind house and bug. I thought the acting was really excellent, especially Roger Bart's performance. He pretty much made the movie for me. The castration scene is number 1 in my scale of all time favorite movie moments. I don't know about anyone else, but this movie pumps me up. If I watch when I'm tired or something, after it ends, I'm just bouncing around, all excited, and ready to do anything. I don't think I can say that about any other movie. So, to sum it all up, Eli Roth is the greatest horror movie maker of today, everyone else sucks, like the people who make the underworld movies, what a joke those are. Eli should really make more and more movies, and never stop. I loved Cabin Fever and the first Hostel, and I'm really looking forward to Cell.

363,beechyjohn,"Garners Sequel status, but not perfection & leaves holes",7,29 January 2008,"It could stand on its own, after all there are a lot of pretty unimaginative horrors out there. However in this movie there are two many shortly timed scenes w/poor editing and the gore is not as thrilling as before. this takes away from the build up and distracts. there is also the poor use of background and lighting. Many of the loose lips from the 1st movie are corrected (security at the facility is to the max and there is no way to escape) and ALL CONTRACTS MUST BE FULFILLED BY CLIENT or else! The storyline teases the viewer w/a small glimpse of what makes a PERSON pay such a high price for UNYIELDING POWER OF TORTURE LEADING TO murder, but doesn't remind us of the suspense from the stare down from the Asian client who warned, ""BE CAREFUL YOU COULD SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY IN THERE""(see Hostel 1). there are no wannabe sex scenes in this sequel (unlike the original) and the end/climax is similar to a 2-minute brother (""Bulworth""). A true fan of the original would want more depth & answers from the teasing scenes(secret room in mansion) and more JUSTICE for the lead character (more in depth scenes). There were scenes that just didn't need to be in the movie (the whole train sequence) and there seemed to be too many people at the hostel's entrance/courtyard, unlike the original where there weren't that many people. As well, there just didn't seem to be that many torture scenes as should be expected. Recommend you watch/rent this flick with another film. I left the film wanting more and felt unsatisfied. Not for blood, but for understanding and craved a true closure. The film's wannabe ending is not the best-case scenario. My suggested ending would be a victim of Russian descent is related to Putin (or the powers that be, not necessarily just rich enough) and secret police/paratroopers are sent in to wipe out the compound...alas they arrive too late to save the Russian, but shut the place down and the Kidd mob wipes out the desk clerk from the hostel/hotel.",Hostel - Part II
364,hketc,Hostel Part 2 was deff worth watching,7,23 February 2008,"Well to start off i loved the first film. I love when movies follow the main characters as if you are on the journey with them because it makes you feel even worse when they are killed off. The second one does the same but this time with three girls. Now, i know there were a lot of people that didn't like the fact that you had to watch girls being tortured because it was ""harder to watch"". I think that is ridiculous. Girls are always killed off in films and this is no different than any other besides the fact that they are getting tortured. Now, as much as i did love this film there where some plot holes and some negative points in it. Jay Hernedez's character in the first one was fun to watch and he is a good actor. So when i found out that he was in the second one as well i was excited cause there could of been a huge revenge part for him. Instead within the first 10 minutes of the film they kill him off and this was executed very poorly. First, it is revealed that he has been staying with his girlfriend? wtf? how the hell does he have a girlfriend if he was off having sex with all these chicks in the frist one? But, on the other hand his girlfriend is played by Jordan Ladd and she is very talented. Another plot hole was that they didn't kill her off? if this is such a big organization and they cover there tracks then you would think that they would kill her to? I know there was a deleted scene with her being killed but it was not added and with good reason cause that scene sucked. Now with the three girls that are in the film. Good acting, good casting, good dialogue but with some predictable character development. Of course there is a reasonable one, a slutty drunk one, and a nerdy one who is also a virgin. Predictable! The torture scenes were good, not as great as the first but still good. Lorna's torture was the coolest and the acting in that scene was great. Witney's torture made you feel really bad for what happened to her and Beth's scene was okay. Now the biggest let down of the movie was the ending. Eli was saying how everybody just loved the ending and that it will completely shock you and when the ending approached i was excited. I shouldn't of been and wasn't for very long. The ending was predictable and nothing about it made me gasp. All in all though this movie was really fun to watch and i own the movie on DVD so i do recommmend this to others to buy",Hostel - Part II
365,dennisrafkin,Hostel 2,3,8 June 2007,"First off, ignore the ""Part II"" slapped at the end of the title. To say this is ""Hostel: Part II"", that would imply that this film and the original ""Hostel"", when put together, create one seamless story. This, however, is not the case. No, this is most definitely ""Hostel 2"", with the forgotten end piece of ""Hostel"" tacked to the beginning. The film opens with Paxton on the train, as promised by Roth long, long ago. However, after a minute or 2 of talking between Paxton and his girlfriend, we find him (quite literally) axed from the movie. No continuation of his story further than into his kitchen. From this point on, the film follows our 3 main girls. I won't merely summarize the movie, but let's just say Lorna, the sweet young girl who is given far too little screen time, is the only person in this movie you will give a damn about. She is dispatched fairly quickly in a (literal) bloodbath, but nothing is really new here. Bijou Philips character, Whitney, is taken care of later. And...well, that's the boring part of the movie. The deaths. THAT'S RIGHT. Roth has somehow found a way to make the most intense and scary parts of the first film the most banal and boring parts in this film. The only field Roth scores points in? The behind the scenes. Watching Todd and Stuart (Richard Burgi and Roger Bart) go from businessmen playing golf to torturers-to-be choosing weapons was easily the most interesting part of the film. A music filled montage of the two of them entering Elite Hunting was one of the best things I've seen in a horror movie in a long time. And when Stuart enters the room with Beth tied to the chair, it's an eerie parallel to Josh and the Dutch businessman in the first film, just completely reversed. We are shown the room as it appears to the torturer, not the victim. Interesting reversal, and perhaps that should have been the whole film. And then the ending...well, let's not even talk about that. Let's just say, it takes everything good about the end of a horror movie and tosses it all into a few minutes, not to mention a groan-worthy ""remember what happened earlier in the movie?"" kind of line that could have been thought up by a third-grader. In the end, a disappointing sequel. If you get a chance to see it later, watch it for the Richard Burgi/Roger Bart scenes. They are it's only saving grace.",Hostel - Part II

The movie let you understand quite a bit more of what the business is and how it works and just how many people male AND female are into it. It is highly interesting and I'm surprised that it didn't stay in the theaters for more than a couple weeks! I liked the ending but was disappointed in the beginnings second scene. There is still so much more the writer could do with this ""series"" Hostel and Hostel II could sincerely become 3,4 and 5. It could go into much more detail - which I would appreciate!

367,jonathankellyoim-1,Better than the original.,7,6 August 2008,"For every new Saw movie there's another copycat movie Hostel was one of those, which was utterly terrible. This time around though its different because Hostel: Part II is easier the superior. The story begins a few months after the original with Paxmen fearing being track down and murdered by slovak psycho's. The Key thing in sequel is it goes into much more detail about the torture sport. There is a website on the internet with people bidding for the tourist they want to have. Roger Bart deserved an Oscar nomation as the nervous man who is having second thoughts about the murder he is about to commit. The murders inhand are bland and unimaginative, except the first which is S&M to extreme level. Overall a good movie which provokes thinking eg does this really happen.

368,MRizzo215,Roth needs to know when to stop,2,29 April 2010,"Stupid. Eli Roth's movies are becoming consistently more and more terrible. Cabin Fever was alright, nothing horrible, but definitely not good. Then came the first Hostel, again, not the worst thing ever made, but no doubt worse than Fever. And now this, Hostel: Part II, this movie made me sick, and not for the reasons you might think. the same rehashing of Roth's typical unlikable characters that we've seen since Cabin Fever. Torture porn, and, surprisingly, lackluster and boring kills (with the exception of one). I would say that the 2 stars that I gave this film come solely because of the ""bath tub kill"" which is one of the better kills I've seen in a long time. If you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. Roth's writing is atrocious and offensive with all of the characters in all of his films calling things ""gay"" and having really stupid dialogue. All of his characters are extremely unlikable because all they are interested in is partying and getting laid. Because of this, when the characters start dying off you have no reason to care, which basically makes the entire movie pointless. All-in-all I hate this film, and I hate Eli Roth. I feel like he is one of the worst directors out there and all of his films are extremely unlikable and thoroughly unenjoyable.",Hostel - Part II
369,Bolex23,"Hostel worked, Hostel Pt. 2 doesn't ... at all.",1,10 June 2007,"Hostel Pt. 2 is unquestionably the worst movie I've seen trying to pass for a legitimate film in American cinematic history. That said, I enjoyed Hostel Pt 1 (Cabin Fever too) and I thought that the first actually had a well told and intriguing narrative that evolved smoothly as the goofy humor turned to horror. Sure there was the torture, but it was complimented by a story that justified the inevitable violence. With Hostel Pt 1, Eli Roth made a good horror movie that was shot well and was effective, for what it was. I expected something similar with the second installment, but I didn't get it. Wereas the first was frightening because it almost felt possible - some creep in Amsterdam enlisted to redirect horny American backpackers to a shady Slovakian town where the rich buy murder - Hostel Pt 2 discards these things - narrative, character development, and plausibility - and in their stead replaces these essential cinematic devices for cheap pornographic torture scenes with some scattered non-mutilated ass to even things out. Yeah, the torture scenes had me grabbing my armrest and biting my lip and, occasionally, cracking a smile at the insanity of what I was watching. And suppose such cheap thrills are all I really should have expected going into this mess, but for 10 freaking dollars I want to see a movie, not 2 hours of Eli Roth's demented wet dream.Decapitations and, well, decapitations are funny in a 2 minute faux trailer like Roth's ""Thanksgiving,"" but not in a feature that offers little else.",Hostel - Part II

There were a few redeeming qualities, such as the two-man- torturer castings, and a plot twist I hoped for the whole movie and received in a pretty simple way. But other than that, this movie was awful. The lead up was about eighty percent of the movie, with about as much blood and gore as you'd see at a good UFC fight, and absolutely nothing that made my fingers grab the blanket, ya know? In fact, one of the most pivotal murders in the movie is at the last second blocked out by some security guard blocking the camera view. A big maiming in the plot is almost a total accident. And the retribution at the end is so quick that if you sneeze you'll miss it. Maybe some will find that awesome, and that's fine, but after being promised ""More violent, intense, and bloody than the original"", I felt so short-changed as to register on this website I love and spend a total of 25 minutes to rail against this regurgitated piece of garbage.I watched this movie and saw the insightful and thought-provoking moments and thought, ""If I wanted a thought-provoking movie with violence, I'd watch 'Saving Private Ryan'"". If you're into two flashes of nudity, a drawn-out script that dissolves in the end, and empty promises of a truly gross and disturbing endeavor, wait until Saw 50 comes out, and it will trump this movie in an instant.

Overall it was good one but there are two moments when Vera Jordanova (Axelle) is speaking pure Bulgarian and the scenes are supposed to take place in Slovakia... and everybody else appear to speak Slovakian. I guess for most people it won't matter if they are speaking Russian, Slovakian, Bulgarian etc as they will not be able to guess the language after all.

I won't give anything away, but the basic storyline is 3 young women are traveling abroad and looking to have a little fun. They cross paths with just the right person. Although it lacks the shock factor of Hostel Part 1, it still has a lot of gore. Which leads me to believe that Tarentino will ""present"" just about anything that is twisted and bloody. If your looking for something smart and sophisticated, well you probably shouldn't be looking for a horror flick. But if you like murder and mayhem, pick this one up. Mmmm, sweet gratuitous violence!

The first movie concentrated on the people being murdered and tortured and this is a look at the other side. From the time the bidding starts we can see that it is a brutally efficient business, creating profit for some of the worst people in the world. Of course, you could say this about many businesses. The fact that 2 rich Americans end up trying to kill/actually killing rich American girls just speaks to the great grip of irony that Roth has. It speaks a lot about the decadency that is our country.Of course there is a lot of gore, and some cheesy overplayed/stolen torture scenes, but this is a horror flick.

This movie is not torture porn. I have seen the likes and this doesn't come close. In terms of brutality I think some of the old Nightmare on Elm Street films surpass this silly little horror. And yet I hold a soft place in my heart for it. Hot/sexy cast, inventive (we really get to see an interesting inside dynamic between the killers and the victims, which makes the whole thing a little more amusing than frightening) and actually almost funny on a couple of occasions. Overall the film was entertaining, in a lot of satisfying ways for a horror film. Not a terrible way to kill a couple of hours.

378,brent16,Roth gets it right,8,24 June 2007,"These days horror sequels don't exactly have a great reputation (and this isn't a new thing. Just go back and watch the Texas chainsaw massacre 2, Friday the 13th part 2 or more recently the grudge 2. So back in 2005 when i first saw Hostel i was rather disappointed (yes it was gory but come on it was more a porno than a horror movie and it really didn't get going until the ending) so a sequel wasn't really high on my to see list. However you'll be surprised how different part 2 is in it's character development. This time around there's been a gender change. We have three American girls, rich Beth (lauren German, the Texas chainsaw massacre), flirtacious Whitney (Bijou Phillips, bully) and boringly virginal Lorna (Heather Matarazzo , the princess diaries)lured to the same hostel in Slovakia in the first movie. Promised a luxurious weekend away, at first that is what they get however the audience knows whats really in store for them. Also another storyline involves two brothers Stuart (Roger Bart, desperate housewives) and Todd (richard burgi, desperate housewives) have just placed a bid to kill an American girl and guess who come into their sights. Hostel part 2 is admittedly very violent (just see the scene where a young woman is hung upside down naked and tortured with a long sharp blade) but it's not as bad as the first one. The acting is rather good Bijou Phillips and Heather Matarazzo being the standouts of the cast.

I do not understand the use of a country of the eastern Europe if they've places like Guantanamo or even in the US to search on. (But yeah i forgot ""the Americans are always the best!"") The film is only a perversity that does not transmit any conclusion or idea. This movie is a blank page with an unreal vision of what East Europe is. The final part of the film is ridiculous and so adds perversity to it all. Please don't make Part III. Awful! 3/10",Hostel - Part II
380,oliver-v,The worst plot twist you can think of,3,1 February 2019,"I didn't expect a masterpiece when I started watching this movie and as it was progressing I was settling on a rating of 5 for a completely average thriller / horror (albeit not the scary kind). My already low opinion of the movie plummeted when it became obvious that they rewrote the script half way through filming and that is horribly manifested in Todd and Stewart's character development. Stuart is portrayed as a shy guy who is unsure about his decision to come to Slovakia to butcher some nice lady, so I'm here thinking that his agenda is completely different - perhaps he paid that 100 000$ to save this woman from being murdered. Todd on the other hand is a psychopath and all he talks about is his first kill. Fast forward to the main event and the bitter disappointment that ensues. For some reason the writers deicided that it would be a great plot twist to switch these guys' personalities around at the critical moment and they did it in the worst thinkable way... They fooled the viewer through false character development the entire time. I feel like I watched ""A Perfect Getaway"" again. Over an hour of character development just to flush it all down the toilet...
Honestly I would have preferred to see the storyline that was predictable - Stuart is empathetic, releases the girl (which by the way is exactly what was happening when he was in the kill room at first) and together they go kill Todd, save her friend, find their way out of the dungeon and then perhaps expose the organization together.

Pros: There were some pretty original deaths and loads of blood and guts which is always a good thing, along with more in depth character exploration which the first film lacked. The second half of the film picks the pace up slightly when the viewer actually gets what they've been waiting for for the past forty/fifty minutes and people start to die.Cons: Some questionable acting, the kidnappers in black could be mistaken for robots at some point and the guys that end up torturing the girls pile on the 'psycho' act a little too much to make it believable.

383,Mr_Torrance,Cheap accommodation for the horror genre,3,8 June 2007,"First of all, i was not a fan of the original Hostel. The only motivation i had to go and see Hostel: Part II was that i was in the town of Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic during some of the filming of this movie and thought it would be interesting to see the finished movie on screen.The movie follows the same premise as the first. Three American backpackers are lured to a hostel in Slovakia with the promise of good times but instead find themselves as 'victims for hire' for the deranged wealthy. The only difference between the first installment and this one is that the victims are female.One thing the original movie had going for it was a good idea. The concept of backpackers in eastern Europe being abducted from a hostel for an underground human slaughterhouse was intriguing and disturbing. It could almost seem possible that a place like this would exist in the 'seedy' and 'darker' side of Europe, especially to those who have never traveled to the region. This movie though, completely kills the concept by making the whole hostel operation seem like a full-scale business with high-tech security, an enormous staff and global network. Any believability this story had just went right out the window. Its fine to say 'its a movie, its not meant to be believable', but in my opinion if you want to make a scary or disturbing horror movie it has to be believable. Wolf creek is the perfect example of this.In regards to the pre-release hype of this movie being 'one of the best horror movies ever' - its not. No way. Not even close. This isn't even a horror movie, it didn't even manage to deliver even the cheapest of horror movie scares - a popcorn-spilling jump. The movie does have its share of gory scenes but these scenes do nothing to make the film scary or disturbing, they are just gory for the sake of being gory to the point of it becoming comical. Some scenes serve no purpose at all in regards to plot or character development and are there solely to try and shock the audience.The main problem i have with this movie is the characters - i hated them. There was nothing to like about any of the three 'victims'. I honestly couldn't have cared less if they were sliced, diced or decapitated. Two of the characters are so stereotypical (a party girl and a nerdy introvert) and one dimensional that there is just no way at all you can relate to them.Instead of over-the-top gore and 'shock value' Roth should have concentrated on developing likable and realistic characters. In the hands of another director the Hostel movies could have been decent additions to the horror genre but Roth butchered a good idea with overkill and a boyish addiction to pointless gore.There is definitely an audience for this movie, but with the rating being R18+ most of them wont be able to see it without a fake ID.",Hostel - Part II

It's easy because so many backpackers going missing from one place and with all the technology to track the killers.Stuart, now torturing Beth, is approached by The Elite Hunting representatives. They offer Whitney to Stuart. After discovering that Todd has been killed, the now deranged and sadistic Stuart accepts the offer and kills Whitney by beheading her. He returns to Beth, blaming her for Todd's death. As he resumes torturing her, she seduces him into releasing her from the chair. Stuart lays Beth on the floor and begins to attempt to rape her, but she fights him off as he lies on her and chains him to the chair. Beth demands that Stuart tell her the code to the cell door, then sticks a needle in his ear when he refuses to tell her. Stuart tells Beth the code (which is Beth's birthday, December 12), but she still needs to be buzzed through the door, which inadvertently summons Sasha and the guards to the room. Beth offers to buy her freedom with part of her inheritance. When Sasha explains to her that she must kill somebody to leave, Stuart insults Beth with a slur she hates being called. Although warned, he proceeds to call her it again. Enraged, Beth cuts off Stuart's genitals and tosses them to one of the guard dogs, leaving him to die as he screams in agonizing pain.

I thought the film paid some homage to Italian cinema in their beautification of blood in the horror genre which made me find a deeper appreciation aside from shock and awe and disturbing situations.

By portraying every killer as a ""broken, maniacal, unbalanced"" individual, they miss out on truly horrifying the audience by having the tortures and murders done by a cold, calculating, normal person, ala American Psycho. A lot of the special effects and gore are badly done with cheap computer effects. (Spoiler) when the girls faces are shown on the phones, the image wavers back and forth due to the fact that the picture is overlaid onto the phone. Through out this movie the effect is repeated when using gore.

The most entertaining part, was the impromptu circumcision towards the closure of the film. The apathetic direction and large amount of cross cutting from the outset of this monstrosity was deeply unappealing and was fitting with the monolithic dissemination of such drivel. The audience was left wondering where Tarantino would take the story due to the gigantic gaping holes within the plot. The plot itself was over-diversified resulting in essential audience flaccidity. Ultimately, the film should have been left as a singular film and not have made the mistake of many films and make a sequel. The film's half hearted attempt at humour can only add insult to what can be described as an idiotic, infinitesimal abomination. Whilst the film was flamboyant in places, Tarantino's flagrant disregard towards the limp story line eradicated the film's appeal. Suffice to say ""one is not amused""!

The characters had no emotional connection to the audience, and the one that even came close, died too early imo. I hope Roth pulls himself together before even ATTEMPTING to touch ""Cell"". He is like a child in need of ritalin when it comes to his film making. Please Roth, SLOW DOWN. The constant amount of ""Homages"" and cameos just seems like a smokescreen for a bad movie! I think the reason why he is so popular is because of his age and upbeat attitude. Another reviewer said something about him getting a big head too fast, and I completely agree. Lets see what you do with ""Cell"" .. hopefully you make it your OWN Eli, because if I see one more homage or, lets say a cameo by Argento for example, that will be the last time I see one of your movies.

389,anatolediordjek,What were they thinking?,4,14 June 2007,"After seeing this movie, I was left wondering ""What were the makers trying to do?"" If it was to simply gross everyone out with a lavish gore-fest, then why did the camera cut-away (no pun intended)whenever an especially graphic sequence was imminent, or else 'stategically place' some obstacle so that the viewer could not see what was happening? If it were meant as a morality play, then why did the most innocent suffer the most, while those who turned towards evil triumphed? If it were meant to imply cognitive dissonance by rewarding evil, then why did the original evil protagonists have to die? If it were meant to provide prurient titillation for young males, then why was there only full male nudity? Is there a hidden homosexuality expressed? After all, the only female who ends up naked is rendered onto a female, while the male malefactors seem to be fastidious about keeping their female victims clothed even though, to pay homage to Freud, male dominance usually involves stripping the female, either literally or figuratively. If anything, this is a movie about female empowerment and, both literally and figuratively, male castration. Perhps it's just a formulaic celebration of all things evil, given the ultimate perversion of the heroine and the recurrence of the evil children. It would be disappointing if, after all, it's merely banal. It just left me scratching my head and feeling vaguely unsatisfied.",Hostel - Part II
390,joegatley,A predictable sequel...,5,31 May 2007,"Once again, three unsuspecting American backpackers are travelling through Europe where they are lured into a sinister world they never imagined could be exist.....Cue 'Hostel: Part II'.I really had high hopes for Hostel: Part II as I thoroughly enjoyed 'Hostel' when it came out. Hostel was original, funny at times, exciting, uber-gory and a good overall film. The ending was especially exhilarating. The sequel however, falls short in many places. Almost every aspect of the film is borrowed from the first. OK, the Eastern European setting still provides a tense, eerie atmosphere, and those little kids are still menacing but it really felt like we'd seen it all before. Because we had of course. Subsitute the three girls for three guys and you could call it a remake.Like the prequel, using unknowns for the three girls makes the film feel all the more real but at the same time it trips over a couple of big horror cliché's and the ending effectively scrunches any remaining realism up into a ball and throws it out the window, so all in all, you're left feeling a bit let down.Personally, I would have liked to have seen more of a tie-in with the prequel, a different location and a more original, realistic story. More than two plot lines would have been nice.One a good note, there were some toe-curling scenes that you won't be forgetting any time soon and this time around we get to know some of the 'clients' which makes an interesting story line.See it at the cinema if someone else is buying you're ticket.",Hostel - Part II

Most of the movie is based on the girls walking the streets doing nothing. There is no mix genres here, just plain stale. Nothing about this movie is enticing, interesting, or suspenseful.The special FX, if there are any, are absolutely horrendous. For example, when a head's cut off, it looks like a 5th grader photoshopped a half-ass circle of blood and tried to crop it around where the head would be; as the body would drop to the floor, the moving .jpg would look more than obviously out of place.There is no atmospheric motion in this game. Please do not listen to the reviewers giving this movie 8, 9, even 10/10. It's absolutely ridiculous. The ending makes you want to vomit. This is a disgrace to the original.

Really clever that... I also had some problems with the shower scene - not because of the gore or nudity or whatever - more to do with the ""what's the point of this?"" feeling it gave me. And what do you know, there really wasn't any point, except simple meanness. After the eye snip in Hostel, the penis snip was a cheap shot. About as unpleasant as a picture of venereal disease, but hardly scary. Neither is shouting C**T! really loud. But Roth isn't pushing any boundaries here, he's done the minimum to get by.

394,filmfan167,Mr. Roth is still learning...,6,12 January 2008,"Personally, I enjoyed the first Hostel film. The second has some good things about it, as well as some bad. I am a fan of Eli Roth, but I believe the enjoyment from Hostel Part 2 can only be derived from what you actually want out of the film. There's no doubt that from various things you will have heard that you will have imagined to a degree the nature of the plot, especially more so if you have watched the first Hostel. As Roth explains in the extras on the DVD for Part 2, watching Hostel is about seeing people get ''f***** up'', and that's fine if you watch the film for that purpose, but I find his own argument and those from certain critics about Hostel Part 2 being ''subversive'' and making social commentaries about violence very difficult to comprehend. The reason 'why?' stems from the start of said extras- where Roth introduces what I believe to be his mum and dad (relatives at the very least), to tell us about the delightful history of violence in art and the nature of violence and psychology (respectively). This is all well and good, but for Roth to conclude the explanation so flippantly undermines the point he strives to make. Hostel 2 baffles me because yes, it makes the point that there is violence and torture in the world. Some people do it for money... others for pleasure. Some people do it for no reason. These are valid points, but are never explicitly expressed. For the film to conclude with a decapitation/soccer game with the head, most people will have jumped on the bandwagon of taking the flippant nature of horror films conveyed through visceral abominations as all they have to offer. This is not true for all horror films. The film itself is perfunctory in the role of giving you blood. But, the lame exploration into the psychological transformation(bizarre, given the context towards the end) of Stuart seems inadequate. Likewise are the build-ups to the three Americans who arrive at the hostel. People out there who can do nothing but criticise because of a ''lack of morals'' or ''societal degradation'' should go and promote a film that actually comments on violence in a poignant manner, such as Titus (1999), and to a degree Cannibal Holocaust. On a side-note for Britain regarding Hostel Part 2, the BBFC have a lot to answer for. Given their usual nature (the BBFC have a phobia about sexual violence- particularly towards women), I expected them to censor Hostel Part 2. I wasn't exactly crushed that they didn't, but their inconsistency is somewhat confusing.",Hostel - Part II

396,xoitalyangelxo,Do not agree at all. laughed through a lot of it,5,21 June 2007,"Hostel 2 did not meet my expectations. I was told this movie would be terrifying. Some of the goriest scene people have ever scene. The people in my theater were actually laughing through most of it. I must admit there were one or two scenes where I was shocked at what was happening but I believe Hostel 1 was definitely more scary and more gorie than the second one. Iw as left disappointed and not scared at all by the end of the movie. Eli Roth did not show how some of the characters were kidnapped. He could have taken the movie another step further in my opinion. As I said, some parts were shocking ie: Mazzarro's death scene, the penis getting chopped off, the dogs devouring the man in the elevator (although I think they could have showed what was going on and it would have made it more scarier. I just think it could have been better thats all.",Hostel - Part II
397,AntHarrisiii,I was BORED,5,10 June 2007,"I'll be honest. I thought the characters were weak, the deaths were not even REMOTELY interesting (beheading? get over it... easiest kill in modern movies and it ALWAYS looks fake) and there was WAY too much unnecessary back-story. What made the first movie good was the feeling of not knowing. Why, then, are we privy to all the behind the scenes inner-workings of this organization? Who cares? The point is, people pay to go kill people... said it in a sentence and it took up a good half hour of the movie. So, the guy that decided NOT to kill the person he paid for probably should have been thrown into the tank and sold to someone who DID want to kill someone. Eaten by dogs? ... wow, couldn't be further from the purpose of the movie. I think what happened was they spent all their money on the genital mutilation (which I expected to happen to the girls, HELLO!) and completely ignored the rest of the movie, ""oh, this should do it"". sorry... no. Don't support this crap, it's just another example of what a high budget can do to a creative idea. And if you want a good genital mutilation movie, go watch Visitor Q. My jaw hit the floor",Hostel - Part II
398,kelomaniack,A very very bad movie,1,1 November 2007,"It is a very very bad movie. Actually Hostel 2 is one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my entire life. It has nothing to do with Hostel 1. You know what will happen in the movie from the first 3 minutes. Also , it doesn't have the suspense and the tension of the first movie. On the contrary it's just a black humor movie and it is not scary at all.My opinion: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. IT SUCKS.I regret spending 1 and half hour of life to see this movie. It does not worth it. You can see many other good movies rather than this movie.",Hostel - Part II
399,pleasekillyourself,please don't waste your time or money,1,9 June 2007,"hostel 2 lifts so much from the original, that i'd be surprised if the movies didn't line up when played side by side.it's strange then, that it still has the ability to be worse than the original when the two are so much alike.not only would i not recommend seeing this in the theater (from what i've heard, it's tough to hear over all the audience laughter and the sounds of people walking out) i would advise against renting it when it comes out on DVD.i'll keep my fingers crossed that Saturday night's box office take is just as disappointing and pathetic as Friday night's......then i won't have to spend the next year and a half hating the thought of a hostel 3...",Hostel - Part II
